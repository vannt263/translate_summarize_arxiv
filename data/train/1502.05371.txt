    "reaction - diffusion systems are frequently used to model the initiation of animal forms and patterns .",
    "after publication of turing s purely theoretical paper @xcite , growing number of biologists succeeded in matching empirical data with mathematical simulations .",
    "morphogens with turing - like behaviour were found in the process of hair follicles formation @xcite , the generation of transverse ridges of the palate @xcite or patterning the germ layers @xcite .",
    "the concept of reactions and diffusion of morphogens was widened to the interactions of pigment cells . in the case of zebrafish",
    ", the validity of this model was tested on individuals with ablated skin @xcite .",
    "turing s mechanism is also used to model the formation of coat patterns in mammals , see for example @xcite .",
    "we will consider reaction - diffusion systems of the type @xmath1 with the usual homogeneous neumann boundary conditions @xmath2 the domain @xmath3 represents the tissue , @xmath4 denotes the time variable , @xmath5 and @xmath6 stand for concentrations of two morphogens , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are their diffusion coefficients and smooth functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 describe kinetics of the system given by interactions between the morphogens , @xmath11 stands for the unit outward facing normal vector to the boundary @xmath12 .",
    "a novelty is an additional term @xmath13 which is unilateral in the sense that there exists a threshold value @xmath14 such that @xmath15 for @xmath16 and @xmath17 otherwise .",
    "this term describes an additional source active only if the concentration of the second morphogen decreases below the threshold @xmath14 .",
    "the key point is that the function @xmath13 can be nonsmooth , a typical example being @xmath18 , where @xmath19 stands for the negative part of @xmath20 and @xmath21 controls the strength of this unilateral source",
    ". our goal will be to investigate the influence of the unilateral term @xmath13 to the turing instability and to the formation of spatial patterns ( spatially nonconstant stationary solutions ) . from these points of view",
    "we will compare the unilateral and classical systems , i.e. system @xmath22 with a unilateral term @xmath13 and the corresponding classical system with @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24 and @xmath25 be such constants that @xmath26 .",
    "consequently , @xmath27 is a spatially constant stationary solution to @xmath22 with @xmath28 .",
    "we refer to this constant steady state as a _ ground state_. the _ turing diffusion driven instability _ is characterized by the stability of the ground state with respect to small spatially _ homogeneous _ perturbations and its instability with respect to small spatially _ nonhomogeneous _ perturbations . in the classical ( smooth ) case , we can perform the well known linear analysis , to find necessary conditions for the turing instability to occur , see e.g. @xcite . if these conditions are satisfied then starting from small nonhomogeneous disturbances of the ground state , the solution of @xmath22 can converge to another , spatially nonhomogeneous steady state , provided it exists . in biology , this process of forming nonhomogeneous steady states can serve as a model of pattern ( prepatern ) formation mechanisms .",
    "therefore , we often refer to these spatially nonhomogeneous stationary solutions as patterns .",
    "we will have @xmath29 in systems under consideration and we will call @xmath30 the activator and @xmath31 the inhibitor . in this case ,",
    "one of the necessary conditions for the turing instability is that the diffusion coefficient of the activator is sufficiently smaller than the diffusion coefficient of the inhibitor , i.e. the ratio @xmath32 is sufficiently small .",
    "our paper is motivated mainly by two surprising results @xcite and @xcite about systems , where the unilateral term is not given by @xmath33 as in @xmath22 , but by certain unilateral conditions for @xmath31 formulated by variational inequalities .",
    "the former result guarantees existence of stationary spatially nonhomogeneous solutions even for @xmath32 arbitrarily large .",
    "the later result concerns certain instability of the ground state for a wide range of values @xmath7 and @xmath8 including arbitrary size of the ratio @xmath32 .",
    "there are also theoretical studies , e.g.  @xcite and references therein , predicting new and interesting features of systems with various unilateral terms or conditions .",
    "the unilateral conditions described by variational inequalities considered in @xcite correspond to sources which do not allow the concentration of the morphogen @xmath31 to decrease below a threshold @xmath14 on a given subset of the boundary or of the interior of the domain .",
    "these hard inequalities , however , seem to be unrealistic from the viewpoint of biological applications , because it is difficult to imagine a natural mechanism which would strictly prevent the concentration of a morphogen to decrease below the threshold .    therefore , we consider a unilateral term @xmath13 in @xmath22 .",
    "this term corresponds to a source , which is active only in those places , where the concentration @xmath31 is below the value @xmath14 .",
    "it does not prevent the concentration of @xmath31 to decrease below @xmath14 , but it works against this decrease .",
    "our goal is to investigate this case and find for what values of the ratio @xmath32 the turing instability occurs , what is the kind of the resulting patterns and what biological implications it can have .",
    "these questions have not been addressed before and we aim to answer them in this paper .",
    "we will consider simple choices of the nonsmooth unilateral term , mainly @xmath34 and its approximations .",
    "unilateral terms of this type have been introduced in the context of reaction - diffusion systems exhibiting the turing instability already in @xcite . however , the stability of the ground state with respect to small spatially homogeneous perturbations as well as its instability with respect to small spatially nonhomogeneous perturbations has not been analysed for this type of systems .",
    "this analysis is nontrivial , because the possible nonsmoothness of the unilateral term precludes the use of the standard linear analysis .",
    "moreover , we show in section  [ se : smooth ] below that the ground state in systems with the nonsmooth unilateral term is stable under different conditions than in systems with smooth approximations of this nonsmooth unilateral term . on the other hand ,",
    "we also show that perturbations of not necessarily arbitrary small size do evolve to qualitatively same patterns under the same conditions for both the nonsmooth unilateral term and its smooth approximations .",
    "thus , the fact whether an arbitrarily small perturbation of the ground state will evolve to a pattern or not is extremely sensitive to small changes of the nonlinear dynamics near the ground state .",
    "a small change of the nonlinear dynamics in the neighbourhood of the ground state can turn a stable system to the unstable and vice versa .",
    "however , the numerical case study we performed indicates that if the initial perturbations of the ground state are larger than a certain minimal size then they robustly evolve to qualitatively same patterns regardless small changes of the nonlinear dynamics near the ground state .",
    "theoretically , it is not clear how to analyse the evolution of perturbations of the ground state that are larger than a certain minimal size .",
    "such theory does not exist .",
    "however , the nonsmoothness of the unilateral term could help .",
    "we observe , at least in the particular examples presented below , that in cases when smooth approximations yield patterns for larger perturbations only , the nonsmooth term yields qualitatively same patterns even from arbitrarily small perturbations .",
    "thus , the question whether the larger perturbations of the ground state will evolve to patterns in systems with ( both smooth and nonsmooth ) unilateral term or not seems to correspond to the question of stability with respect to arbitrarily small perturbations of the system with the nonsmooth unilateral term .",
    "theoretical study of the question what are the parameters for which spatially nonhomogeneous stationary solutions exist is done in @xcite for the case of nonsmooth terms of the type @xmath0 , not for their smooth approximations .",
    "further theoretical results about various other ( nonsmooth ) unilateral conditions can be found in above mentioned papers .",
    "these possibilities of new theoretical approaches further motivate our interest in nonsmooth unilateral terms even if their smooth approximation can perhaps seem to be more natural from the point of view of applications .    here , we do not attempt to analyse system @xmath22 in its full generality due to the complexity of this task . instead , we present a case study of a reaction - diffusion system from @xcite appended by a unilateral term .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ se : biomot ] explains possible biological mechanisms that can be modelled by the unilateral source terms and motivates the choice @xmath35 .",
    "section  [ se : smooth ] shows the significance of the nonsmooth unilateral term @xmath36 and compares its influence on the initiation and final formation of spatial patterns with the influence of its approximations .",
    "section  [ se : results ] presents numerical experiments showing spatial patterns produced by a unilateral system @xmath22 , compares them with patterns obtained by the classical system without any unilateral term , and shows how these patterns depend on the strength of the unilateral source and on the ratio of diffusion constants . in general",
    ", we observe that unilateral terms yield asymmetric patterns with irregular spots .",
    "in addition , for the studied choice of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the system @xmath22 with a unilateral term @xmath13 generates patterns even for greater ratio of diffusions in comparison with the classical system . finally , we show that the difference between the patterns corresponding to the almost zero and high strength of the unilateral source resembles the difference between the roughly regular pattern of the wild type cheetah and the irregular pattern of the king cheetah .",
    "section  [ se : conslusion ] discusses the results and draws the conclusions .",
    "system @xmath22 models diffusion and interactions of two morphogens within a tissue .",
    "these interactions can include direct chemical reactions between the two morphogens and also highly nontrivial interactions mediated by the presented cells .",
    "these nontrivial interactions can be modelled by the classical nonlinear terms @xmath37 and @xmath38 in system @xmath22 , but they can also account for the action of the unilateral source @xmath33 .",
    "for example , we may consider the unilateral term @xmath18 or similar ( for example its smooth approximation ) .",
    "receptors in the cell membrane can detect the local concentration of the morphogen @xmath31 . if this concentration decreases below the threshold value @xmath14 , the receptors initiate a signalling pathway that results to the production of the morphogen @xmath31 by the cell .",
    "the lower the concentration of @xmath31 decreases below the threshold the higher is the production of the morphogen . once the concentration of the morphogen increases above the threshold value @xmath14 , the receptors stop the signalling and the production of the morphogen terminates .",
    "this process is well described by the term @xmath18 . indeed , in points @xmath39 and times @xmath4 , where @xmath40 , the term @xmath41 is positive and works as a source term in @xmath22 . on the other hand , in points @xmath39 and times @xmath4 , where @xmath42 , the term @xmath41 vanishes and has no effect .",
    "when ontogeny of an organism is considered , the natural value for the threshold seems to be around the ground state , i.e. @xmath43 .",
    "indeed , we may provide the following simplistic , but biologically plausible explanation . in the early stages of the ontogeny ,",
    "the organism is small .",
    "hence , the size of the domain @xmath44 is not sufficient for spatially nonhomogeneous solutions to form and the only stable solution to @xmath22 is the ground state @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "thus , it is natural to assume that the concentrations settle close to this steady state and stay there for a considerable amount of time .",
    "for this reason the tissue may consider this value as a normal and satisfactory state .",
    "however , as the tissue grows , the diffusion driven instability occurs and the concentrations start to diverge from the levels @xmath24 , @xmath25 . according to the principle of homeostasis @xcite , the tissue may try to balance the concentrations back by reacting as described above .",
    "therefore , it is natural to consider the threshold @xmath43 .    in this paper , we will consider the threshold mostly at the ground state , i.e. @xmath35 .",
    "however , it is demonstrated in section  [ se : smooth ] that threshold values chosen slightly above or below @xmath25 yield qualitatively the same patterns .",
    "the difference is that these patterns need not arise from arbitrarily small disturbances , but only from those having a certain minimal size corresponding to the distance @xmath45 .",
    "however , if this distance is very small then it makes no difference from the biological point of view .",
    "let us note that the above simplified explanation ignores the grows of the organism during ontogeny .",
    "although it is well known that the grows of the domain @xmath44 has fundamental consequences for the pattern formation , see e.g. @xcite , the basic idea described above is valid , because even the models with growing domains exhibit no spatial patterns if the domain is small .    concerning the shape of function @xmath33 , we will mainly use a simple choice @xmath18 and its various approximations in this paper .",
    "however , in order to model the biologically relevant features accurately , we can modulate the function @xmath33 to control the performance and the strength of the unilateral source .",
    "for example , we could set @xmath46)$ ] to models the limited ability of cells to produce the morphogen .",
    "the lower is the concentration @xmath31 below @xmath14 , the higher is the production of @xmath31 , but the rate of production quickly saturates at the value @xmath47 , because , clearly , @xmath48 ) \\rightarrow \\tau$ ] as @xmath49 .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the unilateral term need not be smooth at the point of the ground state and , therefore , the standard linear analysis can not be performed , in general .",
    "if the unilateral term is non - smooth at the ground state , a natural idea is to approximate it by a smooth one",
    ". such approximation can be arbitrarily precise and therefore we would expect that the behaviour of the approximate system will not considerably differ from the behaviour of that with the nonsmooth unilateral term .",
    "this vague statement is roughly correct from the perspective of the formation of the final pattern , but it is not true from the point of view of the turing instability .",
    "the reason is that the turing instability is a local effect determined by small perturbations of the ground state , but the shape of the final pattern is formed by nonlinear terms @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath33 evaluated at points @xmath30 and @xmath31 distant from the ground state . to illustrate this phenomenon , we provide a short case study to show how various approximations of the unilateral term may influence the turing instability and what are their effects on the resulting patterns .",
    "basically , we show that the occurrence of the turing instability is extremely sensitive on small changes of the nonlinear dynamics near the ground state",
    ".    we will discuss the particular system used in @xcite for the study of skin and coat patterns in fish and mammals , and supplement it by a unilateral source term @xmath13 .",
    "namely , we will consider the system @xmath50 note that this system is a special case of @xmath22 with @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "further note that the original system in @xcite is formulated in such a way that the original real positive ground state is shifted to zero .",
    "this means that @xmath30 and @xmath31 in @xmath55 do not denote concentrations as in section 1 , but their deviations from their original ground state , see @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this difference is unimportant . as in @xcite",
    ", we will assume the homogeneous neumann boundary conditions @xmath28 and parameter values @xmath56 for @xmath57 we will consider several different values .",
    "the ground state of system @xmath55 is defined in the same way as in section  [ se : intro ] , i.e. it consists of constants @xmath58 such that @xmath59 .",
    "clearly , @xmath60 for those @xmath33 satisfying @xmath61 .",
    "this is the case for choices of @xmath33 we are mainly interested in .",
    "however , certain choices of @xmath33 introduced below do not vanish at zero and hence the corresponding ground state is nonzero .    in the case when the additional unilateral term @xmath13 in @xmath55 is smooth at @xmath25 , we can perform the standard linear analysis to obtain necessary conditions for the turing instability , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "namely , we can introduce the jacobi matrix of the map @xmath37 , @xmath62 at @xmath24 , @xmath25 as @xmath63      = \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } \\partial f / \\partial u , & \\partial f / \\partial v \\\\",
    "\\partial g / \\partial u , & \\partial g / \\partial v +   \\partial",
    "\\hat g / \\partial v \\end{array } \\right ]       ( \\bar u , \\bar v ) .       \\ ] ] if @xmath64 then the ground state @xmath65 is stable with respect to small spatially homogeneous perturbations . if simultaneously @xmath66 then this ground state is stable ( with respect to small spatially nonhomogeneous perturbations ) only for some values of @xmath57 and unstable for others , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "parameter values @xmath67 are chosen in such a way that for @xmath23 conditions @xmath68 and @xmath69 are fulfilled . in any case ,",
    "if @xmath13 is smooth at @xmath25 and if conditions @xmath68 and @xmath69 hold then a necessary condition for the ground state of system @xmath55 to be unstable with respect to spatially nonhomogeneous perturbations is that the ratio of diffusion coefficients @xmath57 is sufficiently small . precisely , the condition is @xmath70 note that the definition of @xmath71 in @xmath72 is just a reciprocal value of the formula from @xcite .",
    "it can also be easily derived from the analysis of @xcite . in any case , if condition @xmath72 is not satisfied then the turing instability can not occur .",
    "it is essential that if @xmath33 is not smooth at the ground state value @xmath25 then this linear analysis can not be performed .",
    "jacobian @xmath73 is simply not defined and consequently formula @xmath72 has no sense .",
    "regions of @xmath57 for which the trivial solution is stable or unstable , i.e. the critical border @xmath71 between stability and instability , can be only estimated numerically .",
    "the following subsection  [ sse : instability ] defines six different choices of @xmath13 and compares them with respect to the turing instability .",
    "we emphasize that the turing instability is a local phenomenon determined by _ arbitrarily small _ perturbations and hence only the values of @xmath13 in a small neighbourhood of the ground state @xmath25 are relevant .",
    "we will see that although the six choices of @xmath13 differ only slightly in the neighbourhood of the ground state , some of them yield patterns evolving from arbitrarily small perturbations and some of them do not .",
    "however , further in subsection  [ sse : patterns ] we will see that if the perturbations of the ground state are _ larger _ than a certain minimal size , then they evolve to qualitatively same patterns in all cases .",
    "we note that all systems in this paper are solved numerically by our own finite element solver . for the initial condition",
    "we always choose small random fluctuations around the ground state , except of figure  [ fi : patternsdef ] , where the fluctuations are larger . clearly , different initial conditions may and often do evolve to different stationary solutions , but qualitative features of these solutions are the same .",
    "we choose the domain to be @xmath74 and in the subsequent figures , we plot the patterns as graphs of the solution component @xmath30 , where values of @xmath30 are indicated by shades of grey .",
    "we do not plot the component @xmath31 , because it is complementary to @xmath30 , see @xcite , and patterns based on @xmath31 are almost identical to patterns based on @xmath30 .",
    "now , we will consider different choices of @xmath13 and compare their influence on the turing instability , i.e. on the evolution of _ arbitrarily small _ spatially nonhomogeneous perturbations of the ground state .",
    "the idea is to consider the unilateral source term @xmath75 as the reference choice and the other cases are seen as its approximations . as a criterion for the comparison",
    "we choose the critical ratio @xmath71 .",
    "we will see that @xmath71 varies considerably for different choices of @xmath13 and that this variation is essential even in the case of very accurate approximations .",
    "note that the strength of the unilateral source is @xmath76 for all cases throughout this section .",
    "now , we list the choices of @xmath13 we make , see also graphs in figure  [ fi : choices ] .    ( a ) nonsmooth unilateral source , @xmath75 : :    this is the reference case .",
    "the ground state of system    @xmath55 with this choice of    @xmath33 is zero and @xmath33 is not    differentiable there .",
    "therefore , the linear analysis can not be    performed , but numerical experiments indicate that spatially    nonhomogeneous perturbations as small as we can afford numerically ,    evolve to nonhomogeneous stationary solutions for the ratio of    diffusions below @xmath77 .",
    "note that this value is greater    than the critical ratio of diffusion for the classical case    ( @xmath23 ) , which is @xmath78 .",
    "see    section  [ se : results ] for more details .",
    "( b ) smooth quadratic approximation : :    the nonsmooth function from the previous case can be smoothed for    example as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a    small parameter . system @xmath55 with    @xmath28 and this choice of    @xmath13 has a nonzero ground state depending on    @xmath81 .",
    "nevertheless , the corresponding critical    ratio of diffusions can be expressed from    @xmath72 .",
    "it depends on    @xmath81 as well and its value in the limit    @xmath82 is    @xmath83 .",
    "( c ) smooth cubic approximation : :    another option how to smooth the function from the case ( a ) is    @xmath84 where @xmath80 is again    a small parameter .",
    "the ground state in this case is zero and since the    derivative of @xmath33 at zero vanishes , the critical    ratio of diffusions is the same as in the classical system , where    @xmath23 . using @xmath72 we    obtain @xmath85 .",
    "( d ) linear cut : :    the choice ( a ) can be approximated by a continuous piecewise linear    function such that it is smooth at the ground state .",
    "a straightforward    choice is @xmath86 the ground state is again shifted away from    zero and its value depends on @xmath80 .",
    "consequently , the critical ratio of diffusions depends on    @xmath81 as well .",
    "as @xmath81    decreases towards zero , it slowly decreases towards the limit value    @xmath87 .",
    "( e ) shift of the threshold to the left , @xmath88 : :    the corresponding ground state is zero for all    @xmath80 and this @xmath33 is smooth    at zero .",
    "thus , formula @xmath72 can be easily    used to obtain the same critical ratio of diffusions as in the case    ( c ) and as in the classical case @xmath23 , i.e.    @xmath89 .",
    "( f ) shift of the threshold to the right , @xmath90 : :    this choice yields a nonzero ground state depending on    @xmath81",

    "+    to compare choices ( a)(f ) , we summarize the dependence of the critical ratio of diffusions on @xmath81 in figure  [ fi : dcrit ] .",
    "note that the accuracy of approximations ( b)(f ) of the reference choice ( a ) is controlled by @xmath81 .",
    "smaller @xmath81 corresponds to more accurate approximations .",
    "we clearly observe that different choices of @xmath13 yield considerably different critical ratios of diffusions and , hence , various approximations of the nonsmooth unilateral term @xmath0 exhibit the turing instability for different values of the ratio @xmath57 .",
    "for example , if @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( see the grey diamond in figure  [ fi : dcrit ] ) , then choice ( a ) is the only case which exhibits the turing instability .",
    "indeed , in cases ( b)(e ) the ground state is stable with respect to all small perturbations , because the ratio of diffusion @xmath94 is above the critical value and , hence , the turing instability can not occur . in the case",
    "( f ) the turing instability can not occur , because @xmath95 is positive for @xmath96 and therefore the ground state is not stable with respect to spatially homogeneous perturbations .",
    "similarly , if we decrease @xmath81 to @xmath97 and keep @xmath93 , then the choices ( a ) and ( f ) exhibit the turing instability , but choices ( b)(e ) do not .",
    "note that our statement that the choice ( a ) exhibits the turing instability is based on numerical experiments , where we observe that small perturbations of the ground state evolve to patterns . for more details and numerical results , see figure  [ fi : vzornik ] below , the panels for @xmath76 .",
    "dependence of the critical ratio of diffusions @xmath71 on @xmath81 for choices ( a)(f ) .",
    "the value for choice ( a ) is estimated numerically and the other values are computed by @xmath72 .",

    ", scaledwidth=75.0% ]    figure  [ fi : dcrit ] clearly shows the size of variations in @xmath71 for different approximations of the nonsmooth unilateral source term .",
    "even if we arbitrarily increase the accuracy of these approximations , i.e. in the limit @xmath82 , the corresponding values of @xmath71 differ considerably .",
    "hence , various approximations yield the turing instability for various values of the ratio of diffusions @xmath57 .",
    "consequently , the idea to approximate the nonsmooth term by a smooth one and analyse it by standard means fails .",
    "simple smooth approximations of the nonsmooth unilateral term with accuracy controlled by @xmath81 can yield misleading results in the limit @xmath82 .    from the biological perspective ,",
    "all choices ( a)(f ) seem to be plausible .",
    "although some of these choices have the threshold value shifted from the ground state , the difference is not large , and , thus , they correspond to the biological motivation discussed in section [ se : biomot ] .",
    "however , the idea that the concentrations of morphogens grow from zero during the ontogeny favour the choice ( e ) , where the threshold value is shifted below the ground state .    of course",
    ", we could also discuss many other approximations of the nonsmooth unilateral term .",
    "however , results of the next subsection indicate that all these approximations result to the same ( or very similar ) patterns as the unilateral term @xmath75 , provided the other parameters of the problem are the same . at the same time , it is important to mention that not all of these approximations yield patterns developing from arbitrarily small perturbations .",
    "sometimes , the perturbations have to be sufficiently distant from the ground state , as we describe below .",
