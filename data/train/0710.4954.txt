    "some fraction of these neutrinos may produce supersymmetric particles or some other exotic particles .",

    "most susy scenarios , particles produced in high energy collisions decay immediately into the lightest one and are thus hard to detect .",
    "however in some low scale supersymmetric models in which gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) and r - parity is conserved , the next - to - lightest particle ( nlsp ) is the charged superpartner of the right - handed tau , the stau @xcite . due to its weak coupling to the gravitino , the stau is a long - lived particle in these models . for the supersymmetric breaking scale , @xmath1 gev , the long - lived stau could travel distances of the order of @xmath2 km before decaying into the gravitino .",
    "the distance that staus travel before decaying depends on the gravitino mass ( or equivalently on the supersymmetry breaking scale ) and the stau mass .",
    "limits on the stau mass of about 100 gev come from its non - observation in accelerator experiments @xcite .",
    "recently it was proposed that staus produced in high energy neutrino interactions , where neutrinos originate in astrophysical sources , might be detectable in neutrino telescopes @xcite .",
    "the cross section for the production of staus in neutrino - nucleon scattering @xcite is several orders of magnitude smaller than the neutrino charged - current or neutral - current cross section @xcite .",
    "however , once produced , the long - lived staus have the potential to travel through the earth without decaying and thus open up a possibility to be detected in neutrino telescopes",
    ". the long range of staus could potentially compensate for the suppression in the production cross section by increasing the effective detector volume and therefore enhancing the signal .",
    "the detection of staus depends on the stau lifetime and range , so it is important to determine the energy loss as it traverses the earth .",
    "the details of the range depend in part on the supersymmetry breaking and how the quasi - stable stau particle is comprised of the susy partners of the right - handed and left - handed taus .",
    "the electromagnetic energy loss has been shown to have the largest contribution from photonuclear interactions for stau energies between @xmath3-@xmath4 gev , resulting in a range of @xmath2 km.w.e .",

    "weak interactions may come into play as well .",
    "the stau range has been shown to be sensitive to the mixing angle of right - handed and left - handed staus . when the mixing is maximal , weak interactions act to suppress the range at energies above @xmath5 gev @xcite , however , their weak interactions have the potential to produce signals in neutrino detectors such as the antarctic impulse transient array ( anita ) @xcite and the antarctic ross iceshelf antenna neutrino array ( arianna ) @xcite .    the high energies required for stau production lead us to focus on the production of staus in interactions of cosmogenic neutrinos as they traverse the earth and/or in the detector .",
    "these neutrinos originate from cosmic ray protons interacting with the cosmic microwave background , @xmath6 followed by charged pion , muon and neutron decays .",
    "this flux is guaranteed as cosmic ray fluxes are measured as well as the 3k microwave background .",

    "depending on the cosmological evolution assumed , the overall normalization of this flux has an uncertainty of about a factor of four .",
    "in addition , neutrinos could be produced at the sources of the high energy cosmic rays and those are not included in the evaluation of ess neutrino flux .",
    "thus , the ess neutrino flux is a conservative estimate of the cosmogenic flux .    the cosmogenic neutrino flux , when neutrino flavor oscillations are not included , peaks at high energies , around @xmath7 gev , and thus it is in the energy range where anita and arianna have very good sensitivity @xcite . the neutrino flavor ratio for cosmogenic neutrinos deviates from the common 2:1 ratio , due to the neutron decay contribution to electron neutrinos @xcite .",
    "this implies that one needs to consider three flavor oscillations when considering the cosomogenic neutrino flux that arrives at the earth @xcite .",
    "we consider cosmogenic neutrinos , their propagation , stau production , and subsequent energy loss as it traverses the earth , for a region of parameter space where the staus do not decay over the distances required .",
    "we compare the resulting stau flux when there is no mixing between right - handed and left - handed stau and when there is maximal mixing .",
    "we consider muon - like signals ( charged tracks ) produced by staus and its associated background .",
    "we discuss the potential for eliminating the background by measuring the energy loss , which requires large volume detectors .",

    "the potential for staus to have a long lifetime is an essential feature of this analysis .",

    "is quite difficult . at issue",
    "is the fact that apart from stau decays and charged current interactions , the stau moves through matter in a way similar to a lower energy muon : the stau signal is muon - like .    in terms of electromagnetic energy loss ,",
    "one of the issues is that the average of the energy loss per unit distance at high energy scales with @xmath78 .",
    "the electromagnetic energy loss parameter @xmath64 for pair production and photonuclear contributions to the energy loss scales as the inverse mass of the charged particle . the bremsstrahlung process , important for muon energy loss , is negligible for stau energy loss since it scales with the inverse mass squared .",

    "[ fig : muon - vdsdv ] and [ fig : stau - vdsdv ] can be interpreted in terms of the average energy loss @xmath87 . for a stau of energy @xmath88 ,",
    "the average energy loss per unit distance is of order of that of a muon with energy @xmath89 . if the average energy loss per unit distance is the only observable quantity , the large stau to muon ratios are unobservable because one must compare the high energy stau flux with the lower energy , but significantly larger , muon flux .",

    "we take the ratio of the stau flux at energy @xmath90 to the muon flux evaluated at @xmath91 .",
    "we note that the ratio is peaked at the same angle as in fig . 8 , but the ratio is much smaller .",
    "this is because @xmath87 matches , for example , muons with energies of @xmath73 gev to staus with energies more than two orders of magnitude higher , where the stau flux is low .",

    "with such a large energy loss ( say , @xmath93 ) , there would be no confusing the stau with muon with an energy of @xmath94 since @xmath95 .",
    "on the other hand , a similar energy deposit could come for a muon with the same high energy , but the profile of the track would be significantly different , with more large energy losses along the muon track where the multiple pair production energy losses contribute .",

    "the enhancement of the stau flux is larger from an input cosmogenic neutrino flux than for the waxman - bahcall neutrino flux @xcite . this is because the cosmogenic neutrino flux is peaked at energies of about @xmath7 gev , while the wb flux is characterized by a steep power law with index of two .",

    "we have proposed a way to distinguish between stau and muon tracks by measuring the energy loss of muons via their interactions in the ice , and to use this method to reduce the background .",
    "we also considered showers produced by staus interacting in the ice via charged - current interactions .",
    "the backgrounds for this signal are showers induced directly by neutrinos that reach the detector and interact inside the detector via charged - current or neutral - current interactions . the only way that staus would produce showers in the ice is if there is a weak mixing , but this process also contributes to reducing stau range .",
    "these effects combine with the small stau production probability to give fluxes of attenuated staus that are several orders of magnitude less than attenuated neutrino fluxes .",
    "this small stau to neutrino ratio translates directly to shower rates .",
    "in addition to weak interactions , another possibility for shower production would be stau decays in the detector . for the parameter space considered here , with long - lived staus ,",

    "stau signals at high energies are best identified by muon - like tracks .",
