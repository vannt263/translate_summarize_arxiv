    "it is now a well - known fact that these _ pp_-waves belong to the larger kundt family of spacetimes @xcite which admit a nontwisting , nonshearing and nonexpanding geodesic null congruence generated by the vector field  @xmath1 , the coordinate @xmath2 being the corresponding affine parameter . for _",
    "pp_-waves such a vector field ( representing a repeated principal null direction of the weyl tensor ) is covariantly constant , and all the metric functions are independent of @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , since for the metric ( [ pp_metric ] ) the transverse riemannian space spanned by the spatial coordinates @xmath4 on each wave - surface @xmath5const .",
    "is flat , these _ pp_-waves also belong to the important class of vsi spacetimes for which all ( polynomial ) curvature scalar invariants vanish @xcite .",
    "in fact , those metrics ( [ pp_metric ] ) that are ricci - flat are `` universal spacetimes '' in the sense that they solve the vacuum field equations of all gravitational theories with lagrangian constructed from the metric , the riemann tensor and its derivatives of arbitrary order @xcite , for example of quadratic gravity .",
    "although the family of _ pp_-wave spacetimes has been thoroughly studied for many decades and became a `` textbook '' prototype of exact gravitational waves in einstein s general relativity ( and its various extensions ) , there still remain some interesting aspects of the metric ( [ pp_metric ] ) which deserve attention .",

    "has a natural extension to any higher number of spacetime dimensions @xmath8 by taking @xmath9 , in which case the transverse flat space is @xmath10-dimensional . ] in vacuum regions it is a standard and common procedure to completely remove these functions by a gauge ( coordinate ) transformation .",
    "however , such a freedom is generally _ only local _ and completely ignores the global ( topological ) properties of the spacetimes . by neglecting the metric functions @xmath6 in ( [ pp_metric ] ) , an important physical attribute of the spacetime",
    "is eliminated , namely the possible rotational character of the source of the gravitational waves  its internal spin / helicity .    this interesting fact was first noticed in 1970 by bonnor @xcite who studied both the interior and the exterior field of a `` spinning null fluid '' in the class of axially symmetric _",
    "pp_-wave spacetimes ( see section 18.5 of @xcite for a review ) . in the interior region the energy - momentum tensor was phenomenologically described by the radiation density @xmath11 and by the components @xmath12 representing the spinning character of the source , encoded in the corresponding angular momentum .",
    "spacetimes with such localized spinning sources , which are moving at the speed of light , were independently rediscovered in 2005 by frolov and his collaborators who emphasized their possible physical application as a model of a particle and thus called them `` gyratons '' .",
    "these _ pp_-wave - type gyratons were subsequently investigated in greater detail and also generalized to higher dimensions , supergravity , and various nonflat backgrounds in a wider kundt class which may also include a cosmological constant or an additional electromagnetic field @xcite .    in this contribution we complement and extend the previous studies by explicitly investigating various physical and mathematical properties of these spacetimes",
    "which have not been looked at before .",
    "thereby we put our emphasis on a clear geometrical and physical interpretation of the off - diagonal metric functions and various specific effects associated with the gyrating nature of the source .",

    "indeed , the whole section  [ interpretation ] is devoted to an in - depth analysis and interpretation of the properties of the spacetimes ( [ pp_metric ] ) . after securing the fact that in general it is _ necessary _ to keep the off - diagonal terms in the metric ( subsection  [ gaugefreedom ] ) we use these metric functions in subsection  [ energyandmomentum ] to express the relevant physical parameters of the spacetimes  energy and angular momentum  in a transparent way . in subsection  [ interpretationframe ]",
    "we introduce a natural orthonormal interpretation frame for any geodesic observer and its associated null frame . after studying their behavior under gauge transformations we employ these frames in subsection  [ rotation ] to analyze the dragging effect exerted on the spacetime by the gyratonic source .",

    "penrose field scalars in subsection  [ npscalars ] and determine the petrov type of the spacetimes . in section  [ frame ]",
    "we further employ the interpretation frame to analyze the geodesic deviation in an invariant manner .",

    "in our analysis we will concentrate on four - dimensional _ pp_-wave spacetimes ( [ pp_metric ] ) , assuming that the flat transverse 2-space spanned by the spatial coordinates @xmath13 is topologically a plane .",
    "the gyratonic sources are considered to be localized along ( a part of ) the axis @xmath14 , or in a small cylindrical region around this axis . it is thus convenient to introduce polar coordinates by the usual transformation @xmath15 where @xmath16 and the angular coordinate @xmath17 takes the full range @xmath18 eliminating `` cosmic strings '' and similar defects along the axis @xmath19 . with the identification .",

    "the function @xmath52 does _ not _ occur in the spacetime curvature since @xmath92 .",
    "moreover , in this vacuum case , @xmath52 can always be removed by a suitable gauge , as we shall see in the next subsection .",
    "we now concentrate on the central issue of the possible removing of the off - diagonal term @xmath93 in the metric ( [ general_metric ] ) , or equivalently of the terms @xmath6 in ( [ pp_metric ] ) , see relation ( [ transf ] ) .",
    "first , we consider the gauge freedom @xmath94 resulting in @xmath95    using definition ( [ defomegaj ] ) we immediately conclude that the function @xmath52 is gauged as @xmath96 . with an appropriate choice of @xmath97 we can thus generate _ any _ function @xmath52 in @xmath24 , or remove it by choosing @xmath98 .",
    "geometrically , these terms represent just the _ rigid rotation of the spacetime _ , where @xmath52 is the corresponding _ angular velocity _ at different values of @xmath48 . without loss of generality , by a suitable gauge",

    "a  necessary condition for this is that the _ integrability conditions _",
    "@xmath108 are satisfied .",
    "it is very convenient to express these quantities and relations using differential forms defined on the transverse 2-space ( spanned by @xmath109 ) , namely the 1-form  @xmath110 , and the 2-form  @xmath111 as @xmath112 the integrability conditions ( [ integrabcondit ] ) then translate to @xmath113 it is useful to express the 1-form @xmath110 in polar coordinates using ( [ transfpol ] ) and ( [ transf ] ) where @xmath114 is the metric function in ( [ general_metric ] ) .",
    "this leads to the simple expression @xmath115 see ( [ defomegaj ] ) , so that the integrability conditions ( [ integrabcondit ] ) turn into the simple single equation @xmath116    moreover , as we have seen above in ( [ jaftergauge1 ] ) this condition can be assumed to hold without loss of generality in the entire vacuum region . so by the poincar lemma , the closed form @xmath117 is locally exact , i.e. , locally in the vacuum region there exists a suitable function @xmath105 such that @xmath118 . in view of ( [ tildejh2 ] ) , the corresponding gauge transformation ( [ gauge2cart ] ) then explicitly removes all the components @xmath119 from the metric of the form ( [ pp_metric ] ) , that is @xmath120 .",
    "however , since we have assumed the source to be located along ( a part of ) the axis the vacuum region is _ not contractible _ and hence the closed form @xmath117 is _ not globally exact _ , which means that even in the vacuum region we can not globally remove the off - diagonal terms in the metric .",
    "clearly , the properties of possible gyratons are related to the cohomology of the vacuum region .",
    "summing up , when considering _",
    "pp_-wave spacetimes with gyratonic sources located along @xmath121 it is _ not only preferable but in fact necessary to keep the off - diagonal terms in the metric _ and employ them to express the relevant physical parameter ( namely the angular momentum of the source ) in the most efficient way which we will do next .",
    "to this end we consider the contour integral @xmath122 where @xmath123 is an arbitrary contour in the transverse 2-space running around the axis @xmath19 ( once and counterclockwise ) .",
    "in fact , by ( [ geomintegrabcondit ] ) it is independent of the choice of the contour  @xmath123 in the vacuum region , and it is also gauge - independent with respect to ( [ tildejh2 ] ) .",
    "now , following previous works of bonnor and frolov with collaborators @xcite , we will relate the metric functions @xmath25 and @xmath24 to the principal physical properties of the source , namely its total energy and angular momentum .",
    "in particular , we will prove that the integral ( [ integral ] ) directly determines the angular momentum density of the gyratonic source .",
    "in the linearized theory when the gravitational field is weak the _ total mass - energy _",
    "@xmath124 and _ total angular momentum _  @xmath125 ( relative to the origin of coordinates ) on the spacelike hypersurface of constant time @xmath126 are given by @xcite @xmath127 respectively , where @xmath128 are minkowski background coordinates .",
    "in this section it is assumed that the energy - momentum tensor @xmath129 of the source is localized in a cylindrical region of radius @xmath42 around the axis @xmath19 , with a finite length  @xmath130 in the @xmath131-direction , as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] . as is standard , we assume that the cylindrical source region is matched to the external vacuum region in a @xmath132-way .     to rotate inside the gyraton with the angular velocity @xmath133 with respect to the background frames @xmath134 . in the region outside the source",
    "it is always possible to set @xmath101 . ]    for negligible metric functions @xmath25 and @xmath106 the metric ( [ pp_metric ] ) approaches flat minkowski space with the coordinates @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 . the nontrivial gyratonic components are @xmath11 and @xmath12 , yielding @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "since @xmath126 is fixed we can substitute @xmath142 by @xmath143 in which , however , the negative sign is effectively compensated by the fact that the boundary value @xmath144 corresponds to @xmath145 while @xmath146 corresponds to @xmath147 . therefore , @xmath148 the function @xmath149 where the surface integral is taken over the disc @xmath150 of radius @xmath42 in the transverse space , thus represents the _ mass - energy density _ of the source as a function of the retarded time  @xmath48 such that @xmath151 , while the _ angular momentum density _ of the gyratonic source is given by @xmath152 so that @xmath153 .",
    "it is now seen from the field equation ( [ fieldeqqq2 ] ) that the mass - energy density @xmath154 of the source is determined by the metric function @xmath25 , namely by the surface integral of @xmath155 in the transverse space ( in the gauge @xmath101 and for @xmath156 ) .",
    "interestingly , the angular momentum density @xmath157 is directly determined by the contour integral of the metric function @xmath24 or , equivalently , @xmath106 . indeed , expressing ( [ angmomdensity ] ) in polar coordinates and employing the second field equation ( [ fieldeqqq1 ] )",
    "it becomes @xmath158 using integration by parts and assuming that @xmath159 vanishes at @xmath19 , the inner integral can be rewritten as @xmath160 however , @xmath161 because on the cylindrical boundary @xmath162 of the gyratonic source the metric function @xmath24 and its derivative @xmath163 , cf .",
    "( [ defomegaj ] ) , are continuously joined to the external vacuum region in which @xmath101 everywhere ( using the gauge freedom removing the rigid rotation ) .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath164 which can be reexpressed in a geometric way using expression ( [ geomintegrabcondit2 ] ) for the 2-form @xmath165 as @xmath166 now , employing ( [ omega2formdef ] ) and the stokes theorem we obtain @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the outer contour .",
    "therefore , the gauge - independent contour integral ( [ integral ] ) directly determines the angular momentum density of the gyratonic source .",
    "moreover , from ( [ integralstokes ] ) we conclude that if @xmath169 everywhere in the whole spacetime , the integrals ( [ integral ] ) vanish for _ any _ closed contour @xmath123 and there is no gyraton .",
    "the presence of the gyraton is identified by @xmath170 in some region , for example along ( a part of ) the axis .",
    "this necessarily implies @xmath171 , so that the angular momentum is nonvanishing .    in particular , for the simplest gyraton @xcite located at @xmath19 given by @xmath172",
    "only , we have @xmath173 in the external vacuum region .",
    "this closed form @xmath117 is not globally exact , hence it can not be _ globally _ removed and @xmath174 for any loop @xmath123 around @xmath19 as in ( [ integral ] ) .",

    "we explicitly evaluated the two polarization amplitudes @xmath295 and @xmath296 , see ( [ amplitudes ] ) , which turn out to be proportional to the real and the imaginary part of @xmath278 , respectively . in the axisymmetric case with @xmath428 , @xmath429 ( the frolov ",
    "fursaev gyraton constructed from the aichelburg ",
    "sexl solution ) , which we have studied in subsection  [ assolution ] , the amplitudes are given by @xmath430 and @xmath431 .",
    "interestingly , both physical profile functions @xmath82 and @xmath330 of @xmath25 and @xmath24 ( determining the energy and angular momentum densities ) are thus observable by a detector of gravitational waves as distinct `` + '' and `` @xmath297 '' polarization states , with the wave being purely `` + '' polarized in the absence of a gyraton .",
    "it follows from ( [ amplitudes_for_h0 + ] ) , ( [ amplitudes_for_h0 * ] ) that a similar behavior also occurs for non - axisymmetric gyratons with multipole sources .",
    "it is important to observe that it is the _ derivative _ @xmath300 of the metric function @xmath432 which appears in the curvature @xmath278 and in the wave amplitude @xmath353 .",
    "moreover , @xmath300 directly influences the behavior of geodesics , studied in section  [ geodesics ] , namely the _ axial acceleration _ @xmath433 . on the other hand ,",
    "the mass - energy density of the gyraton encoded in @xmath434 determines the _ radial acceleration _ @xmath334 , causing a focusing of the geodesics .",
    "we have studied _ impulsive limits _ of gyratonic _ pp_-waves in section  [ impulsive limit ] .",
    "there we emphasized that ( unlike in previous works ) it is necessary to distinguish the cases @xmath435 and @xmath436 , when solving the poisson equation ( [ poisson ] ) .",
    "if @xmath57 it reduces to the laplace equation and the field equations put _ no restriction _ on the @xmath48-dependence of @xmath58 and @xmath24 .",
    "hence the corresponding profiles @xmath345 and @xmath346 of the energy and the angular momentum densities can be chosen independently of each other . since by ( [ riemgenprofile ] ) the curvature is proportional to @xmath362 and @xmath437 , it is natural to consider impulsive waves by setting the profile @xmath345 to be proportional to the _ dirac _ @xmath355 but using a _ box - like profile _",
    "@xmath361 for @xmath346 , see ( [ box ] ) and figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath436 the _ supports _ of @xmath345 and @xmath352 _ must coincide_. in particular , the box @xmath361 in the angular momentum density profile @xmath346 naturally leads to two dirac deltas in the energy density , @xmath382 .",
    "these two ( opposite ) impulses on each edge of the box are shown in the left part of figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "physically more relevant solutions can be constructed by superimposing such a particular solution with specific _ homogeneous _ solutions .",
    "this effectively leads to a general energy density profile @xmath383 with _ positive _ parameters @xmath387 and @xmath388 , see the right part of figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "in the final section  [ deodinimpuls ] we analyzed the geodesic equations in the impulsive limit .",
    "we considered the @xmath57 case and the generic profiles @xmath383 and @xmath365 where @xmath387 , @xmath388 are arbitrary constants .",
    "we showed that any geodesic starting long before such a wave _ passes the shock region _",
    "@xmath412}$ ] , considering regularizations of the dirac deltas and the box by standard smooth mollifiers .",
    "in other words , we proved geodesic completeness of impulsive gyratonic _",
    "pp_-wave spacetimes .",
