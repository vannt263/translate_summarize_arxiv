    "in quantum information theory @xcite all admissible devices are described mathematically by means of the so - called _ quantum operations _ ( or _ quantum channels _ ) @xcite .    given a complex hilbert space @xmath0 ,",
    "denote by @xmath1 the @xmath2-algebra of all bounded operators on @xmath0 . in this paper",
    "we will work primarily with finite - dimensional hilbert spaces , so that @xmath1 includes all linear operators on @xmath0 .",
    "given hilbert spaces @xmath3 and @xmath4 , a quantum channel @xmath5 is a completely positive trace - preserving linear map of @xmath6 into @xmath7 .",
    "all such maps admit the _ kraus decomposition _ @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 are operators satisfying @xmath10 .",
    "this definition of the quantum channel is formulated in the  picture , so that the density operators on @xmath3 are mapped to density operators on @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding heisenberg - picture definition goes the other way ( observables on @xmath4 are mapped to observables on @xmath3 ) and yields a completely positive unit - preserving linear map @xmath11 related to @xmath5 by the duality @xmath12 = \\tr [ \\rho \\widehat{t}(x ) ] \\label{eq : duality}\\ ] ] for all @xmath13 and all @xmath14 . in this paper",
    "we will deal mostly with the  picture .",
    "this seemingly simple framework turns out to be rich enough to cover all kinds of general transformations of quantum - mechanical states .",
    "in fact , both purely classical and hybrid ( classical - quantum or quantum - classical ) transformations can be included as well , simply by restricting to a suitable abelian subalgebra either at the input or at the output .",
    "one of the basic challenges , both for theoreticians and for experimentalists , is to discover efficient procedures for analysis and synthesis of quantum channels .",
    "for instance , when designing a device for a specific task ( e.g. , an optimal quantum cloner @xcite ) , one has to run tests in order to determine whether the device performs according to specification .",
    "several such procedures have been proposed already , such as the tomographic scheme of dariano and lo presti @xcite or the maximum - likelihood reconstruction method of jeek , fiurek , and hradil @xcite .",
    "all of these schemes rely , in one way or another , one the one - to - one correspondence @xcite between completely positive maps @xmath15 and positive operators on @xmath16 , to which we shall return later in this paper . our purpose here is to phrase the ideas common to these schemes as an abstract problem of _ system identification_.",
    "consider the following arrangement , shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : io ] : we are given a `` black box '' that implements an unknown quantum channel @xmath17 , which we need to determine .",
    "this will be done by presenting to the black box certain suitably chosen input density operators @xmath18 , thereby obtaining output density operators @xmath19 , and then trying to determine ( or to estimate ) @xmath5 given a set of ordered pairs @xmath20 .",
    "we assume that we can re - use the black box any finite number of times , and that we can employ it as part of a more complicated arrangement . a typical strategy",
    "@xcite is to use quantum entanglement @xcite : one prepares input states ( density operators ) on the tensor product space @xmath21 , and then subjects only one subsystem of the resulting composite system to @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : subs ] ) . this way we have the channel @xmath22 from @xmath23 into @xmath24 , which corresponds uniquely to the original channel @xmath5 .",
    "this extension is , in fact , at the basis of the jamiokowski isomorphism @xcite ( see next section for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the problem of _ quantum system identification _ can now be formulated as follows . instead of viewing the arrangement shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : subs ] as a mapping of density operators @xmath18 to density operators @xmath25 , we can think of it as a mapping of quantum channels @xmath5 into density operators @xmath26 $ ] ( we will use square brackets to distinguish the maps whose arguments are quantum channels from the maps that take density operators as arguments ) .",
    "that is , if we fix a density operator @xmath18 , then we have @xmath26 : = t\\tp \\id(\\rho)$ ] .",
    "we will say that a density operator @xmath18 is _ admissible _ if the map @xmath27 $ ] is invertible .",
    "given an admissible density operator @xmath18 , we will denote by @xmath28 the inverse mapping from density operators to channels .",
    "this points , at least in principle , toward a solution of the problem of quantum system identification .",
    "all we need to do is to prepare an admissible state @xmath18 , launch one of its subsystems through the black box @xmath5 to get the output density operator @xmath29 , and then reconstruct @xmath5 as the inverse @xmath30 .",
    "of course now we are faced with ( at least ) two more problems .",
    "( 1 ) what states are admissible ?",
    "( 2 ) what can we say about the performance of the reconstruction procedure as a function of the ( admissible ) input state ?",
    "we will address these problems in the remainder of this paper .",

    "in this section we describe an approach to the construction of admissible states .",
    "this method is closely connected to the jamiokowski isomorphism @xcite , and is , in fact , a natural extension of the latter .",
    "first we need some mathematical machinery from the theory of completely positive maps .    given a c*-algebra @xmath52 , denote by @xmath53 the cone of positive elements of @xmath52 ( i.e. , precisely those elements that can be written in the form @xmath54 for some @xmath55 ) .",
    "a linear map @xmath5 between c*-algebras @xmath52 and @xmath56 is called _ positive _ if @xmath57 , and _ completely positive _ ( cp , for short ) if the maps @xmath58 are positive for all @xmath59 .",
    "a quantum channel is thus a specific instance of a cp map .",
    "according to the fundamental theorem of stinespring @xcite , for any cp map @xmath17 there exist a hilbert space @xmath60 and a bounded operator @xmath61 , such that @xmath62 the pair @xmath63 is called the _ stinespring dilation _ of @xmath5 . furthermore",
    ", with the additional requirement that the linear span of the set @xmath64 be dense in @xmath65 , the pair @xmath63 determines the cp map @xmath5 uniquely up to unitary equivalence . in that case",
    "we speak of the _ minimal stinespring dilation _ of @xmath5 .",
    "consider now the set of all cp maps between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , for some hilbert spaces @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this set can be partially ordered in the following way . given two cp maps @xmath66 and @xmath67 , we will say that @xmath66 is _ completely dominated _ by @xmath67 @xcite ( and write @xmath68 ) if @xmath69 is also a cp map .",

    "let @xmath63 be the minimal stinespring dilation of a cp map @xmath5 .",

    ", the operator @xmath77 is determined uniquely by @xmath73 and @xmath63 .",
    "next we would like to show that the `` jamiokowski isomorphism '' between cp maps of @xmath6 into @xmath7 and the positive operators on @xmath16 is a direct consequence of the above radon - nikodym theorem @xcite .",
    "we will consider quantum channels from @xmath6 into @xmath7 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are finite - dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "let us fix an invertible density operator @xmath18 on @xmath3 , which we will call the _",
    "reference state_. let @xmath78 and @xmath79 be the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of @xmath18 , and let us also fix an orthonormal basis @xmath80 for @xmath4 . denoting by @xmath60 the tensor product @xmath16 , define the isometry @xmath81 by @xmath82 consider now a channel @xmath5 .",
    "let us define the unit vector @xmath83 by @xmath84 and the positive operator @xmath85 on @xmath60 by @xmath86 with these definitions , we can write @xmath87 where the action of the coisometry @xmath88 on the elementary tensors @xmath89 is given by @xmath90 and then extended to all of @xmath65 by linearity .    it is now an easy consequence of the belavkin - staszewski theorem @xcite that the operator @xmath85 uniquely determines the channel @xmath5 , and that for any positive operator @xmath75 , the map @xmath91 is completely positive .",
    "we see therefore that any invertible density operator @xmath18 on @xmath3 gives rise to an admissible pure state @xmath92 , in the sense that the mapping @xmath93 : = t\\tp \\id(\\ketbra{\\omega_\\rho}{\\omega_\\rho})$ ] is invertible .",

    "we note also that the jamiokowski isomorphism is a special case of this formalism @xcite , and is obtained if we pick as the reference state the maximally chaotic density operator @xmath98 .    before we go on ,",

    "note that @xmath111 is an admissible state corresponding to the maximally chaotic density operator @xmath98 .",
    "then the channel fidelity @xcite is defined by @xmath112 where the quantity on the r.h.s . of ( [ eq : chfid ] )",

    "we do not need all of the properties of the channel fidelity ( [ eq : chfid ] ) [ but see ref .",

    "we also note that the channel fidelity has the natural property that @xmath114 if and only if @xmath115 ( this is a straightforward consequence of the properties of the mixed - state fidelity @xcite ) .",
    "we can rewrite @xmath100 and @xmath101 from ( [ eq : invch ] ) in terms of @xmath18 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 : @xmath118 then we can use the well - known inequalities @xmath119 and @xmath120 , where @xmath44 is the usual operator norm @xcite , to get @xmath121 combining this estimate with ( [ eq : fvdg ] ) , we obtain @xmath122 upon rearranging , we get the desired lower bound : @xmath123 we see right away that worst - case performance of the channel reconstruction procedure is controlled by the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath18 ( or , equivalently , by the largest eigenvalue of @xmath124 ) . this fact has also been pointed out by dariano and lo presti @xcite , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : lobound ] ) gives the corresponding quantitative estimate .",
    "note that in the case of @xmath125 , the constant in front of the trace norm on the r.h.s . of ( [ eq : lobound ] ) is 1/2 , which yields worst - case performance that depends only on the states @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "note that we have discussed here the ideal scenario , namely that there is no additional noise in the apparatus used for the channel reconstruction .",
    "any such disturbance will , of course , further degrade the performance of the scheme .",
    "we have outlined a general mathematical framework for quantum system identification , i.e. , the determination ( or estimation ) of quantum channels through their action on suitably chosen input density operators ( we have called them _ admissible states _ ) . in general , the channel reconstruction procedure will involve the preparation of an _ entangled state _",
    ", followed by the application of an unknown channel to one of the subsystems , leaving the other one intact .",
    "one can show @xcite that the use of entangled states results in an overall improvement , in either the precision or the stability of the reconstruction procedure . on a more fundamental level , however , the use of entanglement is also essential in light of the one - to - one correspondence between quantum channels and bipartite density operators [ that satisfy the consistency condition ( [ eq : cons ] ) ] , which can be explained in abstract terms within the framework of radon - nikodym type theorems for cp maps @xcite .    in this paper we have emphasized quantum channels acting on finite - dimensional algebras , in order to keep the presentation simple .",
    "however , it is important ( e.g. , for quantum information - theoretic studies in quantum optics ) to have a mathematical theory of quantum system identification in infinite dimensions .",
    "some steps in this direction have already been taken ( see , e.g. , dariano and lo presti @xcite or raginsky @xcite ) .",
    "let us briefly comment on some of the big points .",
    "one starts with a density operator @xmath18 that is invertible ; however , the inverse is now an _ unbounded _ operator .",
    "this implies that the reconstruction map @xmath28 will fail to be continuous , which will result in an unbounded growth of statistical errors during the tomographic estimation of the matrix elements of the radon - nikodym density @xmath85 ."
