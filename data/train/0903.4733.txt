    "protons can be accelerated to above 100 eev within grbs both in the internal shock @xcite and external shock scenarios @xcite .",
    "it was suggested by @xcite that if all grbs emit @xmath1erg in cosmic rays and the spectral index ( @xmath2 ) of the accelerated proton spectrum @xmath3 inside them is @xmath4 then they can explain the observed uhecr spectrum .",
    "the association of grbs with uhecr has been further discussed in @xcite . the energy production in cosmic rays",
    "was assumed to be same as the energy production in photons of energy between 20kev-2mev which was used as @xmath5erg in this calculation and spectral index of proton spectrum @xmath6 .",
    "the local star formation rate was folded with the maximum distance from which grbs can contribute to the observed proton spectrum at a particular energy and the proton spectrum from individual grbs to calculate the diffuse proton spectrum .",

    "<S> air shower experiments have detected cosmic ray events of energies upto 300 eev . </S>",
    "<S> most likely these cosmic rays have originated from compact objects . </S>",
    "<S> their exact sources are yet to be identified . </S>",
    "<S> it has been suggested before that gamma ray bursts are possible sources of ultra - high energy cosmic rays . </S>",
    "<S> the two models of gamma ray burst emissions most often discussed are the internal and external shock models . we have calculated the proton spectrum above 60eev from all gamma ray bursts distributed upto a redshift of 0.02 in the internal shock model assuming redshift and luminosity distributions consistent with observations , log normal distributions for their values of lorentz factors , variability times and duration of bursts . within the external shock model we have calculated the proton flux above 60eev from all nearby gamma ray bursts assuming log normal distributions in their values of total energies , lorentz factors at the deceleration epoch and compared with the observed data . </S>",
    "<S> we find that gamma ray bursts can produce cosmic ray proton flux comparable to the flux observed by the pierre auger experiment both within the internal and external shock models . </S>",
    "<S> we have also studied the dependence of the maximum proton energies and the cooling breaks in the proton spectrum on the various parameters like lorentz factor , energy of the grb fireball , variability time ( in case of internal shocks ) , ambient particle density ( in case of external shocks ) . </S>",
    "<S> our results are important to understand how the various observable parameters determine which mechanism e.g. @xmath0 interactions , synchrotron cooling of protons will dominate over one another inside these sources .    6.5 in 0.25 in 0.25 in     +    pacs numbers:98.70.rz , 98.70 sa + keywords : gamma ray bursts , cosmic rays </S>"
