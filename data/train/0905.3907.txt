    "the majority of galaxies in the local universe reside in groups .",
    "early group samples were defined as overdense areas on the sky from photographic plates while redshift surveys later allowed for groupings in a third dimension .",
    "investigations have sought to determine whether these systems are bound gravitationally or simply chance projections of unrelated galaxies along a line of sight .",
    "observations of groups enveloped in a hot , x - ray emitting halo similar to the hot medium found in rich clusters @xcite along with evidence in others for interactions between group members have shown that many groups are indeed gravitationally bound systems .",
    "galaxy properties , like morphology and star - formation rate ( sfr ) , are observed to change with environment ; high density regions , like clusters , are characterized by a larger fraction of elliptical galaxies and a lower star - formation rate than seen in the field @xcite .",
    "these observations are known as the morphology - density and sfr - density relations , although @xcite argue that these reflect a tighter and more fundamental morphology - radius relation .",
    "these relations are not limited to clusters , they are seen in groups of galaxies as well @xcite which suggests that the physical mechanisms which play a role in producing these relations are also important in the group environment .",
    "these mechanisms include some combination of tidal interactions , mergers , ram pressure stripping , and strangulation .",
    "although , there is debate over the effectiveness of ram pressure stripping and strangulation in the group environment @xcite .",
    "we use because it is an excellent tracer of tidal interactions and often shows evidence for these gravitational disturbances when optical observations of the same source appear undisturbed .",
    "additionally , observations of groups are able to probe a population of gas rich galaxies which may not be detected in optical observations .",
    "our current understanding of the evolution of groups is derived from observed correlations between the fraction of a group s galaxies that are elliptical , the presence of a diffuse x - ray emitting halo , and a high velocity dispersion @xcite . additionally , numerical simulations suggest that galaxies within a compact group eventually merge to form large ellipticals @xcite .",
    "thus , the evolution of a group should be marked by the removal of from the individual galaxies , dumping it into the intragroup medium where it can be heated , along with primordial intergalactic gas , to x - ray emitting temperatures .",
    "this may be initially accompanied by enhanced star formation within the individual galaxies that leads to the feedback of diffuse hot gas into the intragroup medium @xcite .",
    "we use these data to compile an hi mass function ( himf ) for galaxy groups . in general , the least well - known component of the himf",
    "is the slope of the low mass end .",
    "cosmological and galaxy evolution models depend on this slope as a constraint .",
    "a handful of blind surveys , as well as targeted hi observations of individual clusters and groups of galaxies , have attempted to accurately determine the slope of the low mass end of the mass function @xcite .",
    "evidence from these , and other , observations suggests that the low mass slope of the himf may vary with environment @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine the content of a diverse sample of galaxy groups .",

    "large surveys must deal with volume corrections which account for the fact that low luminosity objects are more easily detected nearby and their contribution throughout the whole volume must be weighted accordingly .",

    "low mass galaxies which can be detected near the front of the cube may be undetectable at the back side of the cube .",
    "this means that we are sensitive to low masses in a subset of the total volume surveyed . to account for this",
    "we apply a volume correction to the lowest three mass bins @xcite . to determine this correction for a given cube we calculate the actual volume over which we could detect a galaxy with a given mass based on the noise level and size of the cube .",
    "then we add the volumes calculated by this method together for all cubes .",
    "the himf is then produced by dividing the total number of detections in a mass bin by the corresponding volume surveyed for masses in that bin among all groups .",
