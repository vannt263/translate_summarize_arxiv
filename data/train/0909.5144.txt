    "along with the fast development of laser technology , the power intensity which is inaccessible one decade before becomes reality .",
    "the focused laser intensity of @xmath0 is available today . the new generation of laser system such as eli is under construction .",
    "focused intensity of @xmath1 is just forward  @xcite . by use of such intense laser power , plenty of physical problems",
    "can be studied and amount of applications are waiting for discovering . among them",
    "particle acceleration presently and will still attract extensive attentions .",
    "electron acceleration by laser plasma accelerator is aimed to tev  @xcite , ion acceleration also towards to stable , high and mono - energetic beam  @xcite .",
    "besides ultrahigh power laser system , plasma mirror technology also makes the high contrast clean pulse possible  @xcite , which makes ultrathin target  ( @xmath2 nm thickness ) now applicable for ion acceleration  @xcite . unlike the target normal sheath field acceleration  ( tnsa )",
    "@xcite , radiation pressure dominated ion acceleration  ( rpa ) can have a much longer acceleration distance  @xcite .",
    "simulation results show ions can get gev energy when a 20fs long laser pulse with @xmath0 intensity is used  @xcite . besides the two mentioned ion acceleration mechanisms , recently ion acceleration in the optical transparency region named the `` laser breakout afterburner ''  ( boa )  @xcite has also been studied .",
    "it demonstrates that ions can get continuously acceleration even the laser pulse transmits through the ultrathin foil , which also gives a possible way to get high energy ion beams .",
    "as is well known , high energy particles when suffering acceleration self - radiation is concomitant .",
    "radiation reaction effects should be considered when the radiation damping force is comparable to the external one . for the above mentioned processes for particle acceleration , electrons are always endured intensive acceleration .",
    "when the laser intensity increases further , the radiation reactions can not be neglected .",
    "et al . _ have studied the radiation reaction effect on the laser hole boring process and point out it plays a positive role as it allows one to maintain the electron thermal energy on a relatively low level and prevents the electron backward motion through the pulse  @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study their effects on ion acceleration . as a primary result",
    ", we find the radiation mainly comes from the electrons moving backwards in the laser pulse and the radiation damping impedes this kind of backward motion , which can reduce the particles volume in the phase space and improve the ion acceleration energy and quality .",
    "sketch map of laser electron interaction . here",
    "a linearly polarized laser pulse is used.,width=226 ]",
    "before showing the effect of radiation damping , we first check the threshold of the laser intensity for the important radiation reaction effects from existed fundamental formulae . for an electron with velocity @xmath3",
    ", one can get the radiation power @xmath4 at the local radiation time @xmath5 as : @xmath6 when @xmath7 , and @xmath8 when @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath10 is the electron momentum , @xmath11 is the relativistic factor , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the charge and mass of the electron , respectively .",
    "so the radiation due to the transverse acceleration is @xmath14 stronger than the one due to the longitudinal acceleration . for the synchrotron radiation",
    ", the radiation is mainly in the direction of electron motion and concentrated within an angle of @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "based on the above knowledge , in the pic code we only consider the radiation due to the transverse acceleration and only the electrons whose @xmath17 are assumed to contribute the radiation .    by use of the normalized variables as in the pic code ( @xmath18 )",
    ", we can get the momentum variation rate as : @xmath19 in one simulation step it changes : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the planck constant , @xmath22 is the laser frequency and @xmath23 is the photon energy of the laser pulse . to be",
    "simply , in the pic code we also assume the radiation is in form of photons .",
    "the photon frequency is @xmath24 and the corresponding photon number is @xmath25 .",
    "the radiation reaction force on the electron then is : @xmath26 the reaction force points to the opposite direction of the electron motion . on the other hand",
    ", the electron also feels the external force as  ( here we only show the transverse force due to laser field . ) : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the intensities of electric and magnetic fields normalized by @xmath30 .",
    "we can get the threshold of the laser intensity for the obvious radiation damping effect by using : @xmath31 it is : @xmath32 usually in a laser pulse , @xmath33 . for an electron moving along with a linearly polarized laser pulse",
    ", we have : @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the normalized laser field . to get an obvious radiation effect",
    ", it should satisfy @xmath36 , correspondingly the laser intensity should satisfy : @xmath37 .",
    "it is about @xmath38 for a laser with a wavelength of @xmath39 , which is higher than the current running laser system .",
    "however , for an electron with longitudinal velocity of @xmath40 , eq .",
    "( [ threshold ] ) changes to @xmath41 .",
    "when the electron moves in the opposite direction of the laser pulse with the longitudinal velocity @xmath42 , then one can get @xmath43 .",
    "that is the threshold of @xmath35 can be @xmath11 times smaller when the electrons with the same energy  ( @xmath11 ) move backward  ( see fig .",
    "[ profile - fig1 ] ) .",
    "the reason is that the radiation force is proportion to the square of the acceleration force . for the electrons",
    "moving forwards the transverse force they feel is about zero  ( @xmath44 ) , so the radiation force is even smaller .",

    "we suppose that , at any given moment of time , the electron radiation spectrum is synchrotron like  @xcite .",
    "the critical frequency @xmath24 is given by the relation @xmath50 ; @xmath51 is the variation of transverse electron momentum force during the time step of @xmath52 . in our pic code , we follow trajectories of each electron and calculate the emission during the interaction .",
    "we calculate the damping effects by considering the electron s recoil due to the emitted radiation . the recoil force is included in the equations of electron motion .",
    "we should mention that our method is different with the one used by martins _",

    "electrons have much smaller volume in the phase space when the radiation damping is included in the simulation . in this case",
    "no backward ion acceleration has been found .",
    "much more ions are confined in the front accelerating bunch compared with the simulation without radiation damping .",
    "the electron energy spectrum also shows that electrons have a much lower peak energy ( 10  mev ) in the radiation included simulation , however , it is about 150  mev in the simulation without radiation damping .",
    "proton energy spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ particle_spec ] confirms much more protons are concentrated and accelerated in the bunch whose peak energy is about 1.5gev at @xmath46 .",
    "( a ) electron distribution in the @xmath71 phase space , the momentum is normalized by @xmath72 ; ( b ) proton distribution in the @xmath71 phase space ; ( c ) electron energy spectrum , the momentum is normalized by @xmath73 ; ( d ) proton energy spectrum .",
    "the time here is @xmath46.,width=321 ]    from the energy point of view , at @xmath46 , totally @xmath74 laser energy density has been transported into the simulation box .",
    "when no radiation damping is included , among them @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) transforms to electrons and @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) transforms to protons . when radiation damping is included , @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) transforms to electrons and @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) transforms to protons .",
    "as we see radiation damping reduces the electron energy , however , it improves the proton acceleration .",
    "neglect of radiation damping gives a lower estimation of energy conversion efficiency and worse spectrum .    in our simulations , we find that the high energy radiation appears when @xmath83 .",
    "its quotient among the total radiation increases with the laser intensity .",
    "when @xmath84 , there is only high energy radiation .",
    "these different radiation profiles also reflect the different acceleration scenarios . from the balance between the forces due to electrostatic field and radiation pressure  @xcite : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the thickness of the target normalized by laser wave length ( @xmath87 ) and @xmath88 is the relativistic hole boring velocity  @xcite , we can get the critical laser intensity for the laser pulse transmitting through the target . for our present simulation parameters : @xmath89 , we get @xmath90 .",
    "the intensity is close to the critical value ( @xmath91 ) for the high energy radiation .",
    "it means when the laser intensity is higher than @xmath92 , the target tends to be transparent to the laser pulse .",
    "stable ( at least in the 1d case ) structure of radiation dominated ion acceleration begins mixing with other acceleration mechanism ( such as boa ) .",
    "however , some ions can still be accelerated by the radiation pressure .",
    "the amount of these ions depends on the laser intensity .",
    "other ions are accelerated or decelerated by the dispersed electrons .",
    "when the laser intensity increases further , radiation pressure acceleration disappears completely .",
    "ions can only be accelerated in the heated electron pool which moves with the laser pulse . in this scenario ,",
    "the radiation damping is important and necessary , which actually makes the electron pool cooling down and improves the ion acceleration .",
    "further investigation still needs for this kind of acceleration scenario .",
    "in summary , by use of pic simulations we studied the radiation reaction effects on the ion acceleration in the radiation pressure dominated region and the transparent plasma region .",
    "we find radiation damping effects are important for the electrons moving backwards and immersed in the laser pulse .",
    "self - radiation impedes backward motion , cools down the electrons and makes more ions be concentrated and accelerated .",
    "we notice recently many studies on ion acceleration by use of ultrathin foil target , in which target plasma is almost transparent to the laser pulse .",
    "electrons are dancing with the transmitted relatively long laser pulse .",
    "the local charge separation field takes in charge of ion acceleration . in this condition ,",
    "a correct electron distribution in phase space is important to get the correct final maximum accelerated ion energy and acceleration scaling .",
    "when the laser intensity is larger than @xmath48 , radiation reaction could change the electron distribution in phase space .",
    "furthermore , with future laser system such as eli  ( @xmath93 ) , laser intensity is high enough to awake the contribution of radiation damping . even for the electrons move forward",
    ", the radiation reaction should be considered .",
    "it deserves and is necessary to include the radiation reaction effects in the future pic simulations when ultra intense laser pulse is used .",
