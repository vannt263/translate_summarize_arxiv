    "recent speculation over bcs type - instabilities in the fermi surface at high density @xcite@xcite has led to resurgence of interest in two colour qcd .",
    "lattice models with pseudoreal representations are attractive candidates for simulation at finite density since for such theories the dirac matrix is positive definite , which permits the use of existing monte carlo techniques at @xmath3 . for su(3 ) at finite density the lattice action is otherwise complex @xcite , and so the probabilistic importance sampling step of such methods is therefore undefined .",
    "reweighting methods have proved a useful means of addressing this issue , where the @xmath0 dependence of the grand canonical partition function @xmath4 can be made semi - analytic in a fugacity expansion , as with the glasgow method @xcite .",
    "the complex action issue is thus avoided , by generating a lattice ensemble in an accessible regime of the parameter space ( eg .",
    "@xmath5 for su(3 ) ) .",
    "naively , one might anticipate that the specific lattice ensemble used in the reweighting has little impact on numerical evaluations of the expansion .",
    "in fact quite the reverse is true . for the su(3 )",
    "model with dynamical quarks , even at intermediate coupling where one might expect thermal fluctuations to enhance the frequency of sampling physically relevant states , an ensemble generated at @xmath6 reproduces a similar phase structure to the quenched model @xcite@xcite .",
    "this has severe consequences since quenched finite density qcd is understood to be the zero flavor limit ( @xmath7 ) of a theory with equal numbers of quarks and conjugate quarks .",
    "the lowest lying baryonic state in the model is thus the unphysical `` baryonic pion '' , formed from quark - conjugate quark pairs rather than the lightest three quark state @xcite@xcite .",
    "however , this is of no consequence in two colour qcd @xcite as the baryonic pion and baryon propagators are equivalent at @xmath3 .",
    "pseudoreal models are not entirely free from the effects of the reweighting overlap pathologies , however .",
    "models with quarks in the adjoint representation ( with @xmath8 odd ) suffer from the related reweighting pathology : the sign problem . since @xmath9 is always real for two colour qcd , although reweighting is no longer mandatory it provides a useful opportunity to investigate the overlap issue ( where the correct physics may be more easily extracted from lattice measurements by conventional means ) , and to quantify the signatures of the sampling numerical discrepancies therein .",
    "the @xmath10flavor symmetry of su(2 ) qcd given by quarks in their fundamental representation @xmath11 , is @xmath12 rather than @xmath13 as might be anticipated , as is demonstrated by a change of basis in the free field langrangian .",
    "@xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a @xmath11 doublet .",
    "the inclusion of explicit symmetry breaking terms in @xmath17 and @xmath0 can be shown similarly to lead to the symmetry breaking patterns tabulated above @xcite@xcite . @xmath18    .global @xmath10flavor symmetries of the two colour qcd action , in the continuum and with staggered quarks for @xmath19 . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "despite expectations , generating an ensemble for the reweighting method with a value of @xmath20 arbitrarily close to @xmath21 still leads to an overlap problem in a model with a pseudoreal representation evaluated at @xmath22 .",
    "in fact , for an exploratory study ( in which @xmath21 is unknown ) , the fugacity expansion coefficients are more effectively sampled through the combination of terms from a covering series of ensembles .",
    "even with the real monte carlo measure of two colour qcd the overlap problem is still pathological for the glasgow reweighting method . with new multi - parameter ( @xmath23 , @xmath0 ) reweighting approaches to su(3 )",
    "@xcite we would therefore expect there to be similar sampling bias in the coefficients across the full fugacity expansion . in order to successfully investigate the possibility of there being similar tricritical behavior in the @xmath24 phase plane of su(3 ) @xcite with the glasgow method ,",
    "this issue of effective sampling across the full range of the polynomial this overlap problem should then be addressed . as we have , seen substantially different transition points",
    "are determined from reweighting measurements at intermediate coupling from ensembles generated with @xmath20 arbitrarily close to @xmath21 .",
    "lee yang zero analysis allows the simple identification of a first order transitions in @xmath0 with lattice measurements on comparatively small volumes . to extend the rigor of this approach and determine the critical exponents of the transition at @xmath21 , however , it will be necessary to increase the lattice size as the zeros scaling at @xmath25 is not without finite volume effects",
    "it will also be interesting to repeat this volume scaling analysis for @xmath26 and to compare the measured critical exponents for the diquark phase transition with those predicted with the chiral langragian approach @xcite , believed to be second order .",
