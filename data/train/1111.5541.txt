    "bose - einstein condensates with spin degrees of freedom  @xcite attracted in recent years great interest due to the unique possibility of exploring fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics in a remarkably controllable and tunable environment . the ability to generate spin squeezing and entanglement  @xcite makes spinor bose gases promising candidates for applications as quantum simulators  @xcite , in quantum information  @xcite , and for precise measurements  @xcite .",
    "moreover , spinor condensates were successfully used to recreate many of the phenomena of condensed matter physics in experiments displaying an unprecedented level of control over the quantum system . in particular ,",
    "spin domains  @xcite , spin mixing  @xcite , and spin vortices  @xcite were predicted and observed .",
    "the ability to create spin domains is a crucial component of applications including data storage and spin based logic implementation  @xcite . to date ,",
    "domain structures in bose - einstein condensates were created in a controllable way using inhomogeneous magnetic fields  @xcite . in principle , these can be induced by magnetic coils , electronic chips or permanent magnets  @xcite . however , both the spatial resolution of this method and the ability to produce arbitrarily shaped , reconfigurable spin domain structures is severely limited .    in recent papers",
    "@xcite , we considered the possibility of phase separation in the ground state of spinor condensates .",
    "we demonstrated that this phenomenon can take place in both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic condensates in external potentials . in this paper , we exploit the phenomenon of phase separation to propose a method of controlled creation of metastable spin domain states with a chosen spatial spin structure .",
    "it consists of applying an appropriately designed optical potential , which is subsequently slowly relaxed towards the desired final trapping potential .",
    "in contrast to the other method , relying on magnetic field gradients to separate spin components , our method uses more easily reconfigurable optical laser fields to shape the spatial structure .",
    "importantly , these structures are not `` pinned '' by local extrema of the magnetic field .",
    "an additional advantage is the high spatial resolution , which we demonstrate to be generally limited only by the spin healing length of the condensate .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec_model ] reviews the mean - field model of a spin-1 condensate in a homogeneous magnetic field . in section  [ sec_numerical ]",
    "we present numerical simulations of the spin domain creation process . in section  [ sec_limitations ]",
    "we discuss practical limitations of the proposed method using both analytical and numerical approach .",
    "section  [ sec_conclusions ] concludes the paper .",
    "we consider a spin-1 bose - einstein condensate in a homogeneous magnetic field pointing along the @xmath0 axis .",
    "we apply the mean field approximation , which describes dilute bose - einstein condensates at zero temperature . in spinor condensates",
    ", ground states can substantially deviate from the mean field solutions even at zero temperature due to large quantum fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "however , it was shown that the introduction of a weak magnetic field restores the validity of the mean - field model .",
    "we start with the hamiltonian @xmath1 , @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the wave functions of atoms in magnetic sublevels @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the atomic mass , @xmath6 is an external potential and @xmath7 is the total atom density .",
    "the asymmetric ( spin dependent ) part of the hamiltonian is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the zeeman energy shift for state @xmath10 and the spin density is , @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the spin-1 matrices  @xcite and @xmath13 .",
    "the spin - independent and spin - dependent interaction coefficients are given by @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the s - wave scattering length for colliding atoms with total spin @xmath17 .",
    "the total number of atoms and the total magnetization in the direction of the magnetic field @xmath18 are conserved quantities . the zeeman energy shift for each of the components",
    ", @xmath9 can be calculated using the breit - rabi formula  @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the hyperfine energy splitting at zero magnetic field , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the bohr magneton , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the nuclear and electronic g - factors , and @xmath25 is the magnetic field strength .",
    "the linear part of the zeeman effect gives rise to an overall shift of the energy , and so we can remove it with the transformation @xmath26 this transformation is equivalent to the removal of the larmor precession of the spin vector around the @xmath0 axis @xcite .",
    "we thus consider only the effects of the quadratic zeeman shift .",
    "for sufficiently weak magnetic field we can approximate it by @xmath27 , which is positive for @xmath28rb and @xmath29na condensates .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ en ] ) gives rise to the gross - pitaevskii equations describing the mean - field dynamics of the system @xmath30 \\psi_{\\pm } + c_2 \\psi_0 ^ 2 \\psi_{\\mp}^ * \\ , , \\\\\\nonumber i \\hbar\\frac{\\partial \\psi_{0}}{\\partial t}&=\\left [ \\mathcal{l } - \\delta e + c_2 ( n_{+ } + n_-)\\right ] \\psi_{0 } + 2 c_2 \\psi_+ \\psi_- \\psi_{0}^ * \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 .    by comparing the kinetic energy with the interaction energy , we can determine the healing length @xmath33 and the spin healing length @xmath34 .",
    "these quantities give the length scales of spatial variations in the condensate profile induced by the spin - independent or spin - dependent interactions , respectively .",
    "analogously , we define the magnetic healing length as @xmath35 .    in spin-1 condensates created to date ,",
    "the @xmath36 and @xmath37 scattering lengths have similar magnitudes .",
    "the spin - dependent interaction coefficient @xmath38 is then much smaller than its spin - independent counterpart @xmath39 .",
    "for example , this ratio is about 1:30 in a @xmath29na condensate and 1:220 in a @xmath28rb condensate far from feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "consequently , changing the total density @xmath40 requires much more energy than changing the relative populations of spin states @xmath41 . in our considerations",

    "the spin domains align according to a simple rule ; the magnetized domains reside in the regions with the lowest density , while the unmagnetized domains fill the areas of high density . in this way",
    ", the nonlinear spin energy of the antiferromagnetic condensate is minimized for a given total magnetization . in this work , we will show that one can use this property to shape the spatial distribution of spin with an appropriate time varying external potential .",

    "( [ gp ] ) @xcite with rescaled interaction coefficients @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the transverse trapping frequency .",
    "the fermi radius of the transverse trapping potential is smaller than the spin healing length , and the nonlinear energy scale is much smaller than the transverse trap energy scale , which allows us to reduce the problem to one spatial dimension @xcite . to create a double well potential , we add a gaussian potential barrier that can be realized eg .  by an additional blue - detuned laser beam @xmath56 in the absence of the barrier , and under certain experimental conditions  @xcite ,",
    "the ground state is characterized by spatial separation of the @xmath57 and @xmath58 atoms ( or @xmath59 , depending on the magnetization ) , see fig .  [ fig_switchon](a ) .",

    "[ fig_switchoff](c ) .",
    "again , we checked that these spin domains are perfectly stable on the timescales as long as several seconds due to suppressed tunneling . in principle , by applying several potential barriers with certain parameters , it is possible to create a given number of stable spin domains of various sizes .",

    ", width=359 ]    we now discuss some limitations of the above method of domain creation . as we mentioned above ,",
    "these metastable states are stable on an experimentally relevant time scale due to the suppression of tunneling . however , the tunneling rate depends on the system parameters such as the trap size and atom number . in fig .",
    "[ fig_limit ] we show the result of adiabatic barrier removal for tighter harmonic traps with @xmath70hz ( a ) and @xmath71hz ( b ) .",
    "the atom number is here reduced proportionally to keep a similar density profile .",
    "thus , an analogous domain structure as in fig .  [ fig_switchoff](c ) is expected . since the healing length ,",
    "determining the size of domain boundaries ( see below ) is almost the same in all cases due to a similar atom density profile , we expect the tunneling to be more significant in smaller systems . indeed , the effect of the tunneling is clearly visible when comparing fig .",
    "[ fig_switchoff](c ) with fig .  [ fig_limit](a ) and ( b ) . with the decreasing distance between the domains",

    "[ fig_limit](a ) . in the case of the tightest trap ,",
    "[ fig_limit](b ) , the middle domain dissolves completely and the single - well ground state is obtained .",
    "the tunneling rate can be estimated analytically along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the case of a spatially varying magnetic field potential was considered . here",
    ", we apply a similar method to the case of a spatially varying external potential .",
    "first , we assume that the condensate separates into two components , one of them being @xmath57 and the other either @xmath58 or @xmath59 , and neglect the influence of the third component .",
    "the potential energy for the @xmath72 atoms is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the other present component .",
    "the interaction constants in an @xmath75 condensate are @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "we estimate the tunneling rate of @xmath78 atoms from the middle domain in a structure similar as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_switchoff](c ) towards the edges of the condensate .",
    "the chemical potential of atoms in the middle domain is @xmath79 .",
    "we assume that the density of @xmath57 component is negligible .",
    "analogously , in the neighboring domain the @xmath57 atoms have chemical potential equal to @xmath80 . the @xmath58 atoms which tunnel through this domain feel the potential @xmath81 .",
    "their density profile can be calculated in the wkb approximation @xmath82 where the decay of the density means that @xmath83 on the right side of the middle domain and @xmath84 on the left side . in the simplest approximation",
    ", @xmath85 does not vary significantly and the decay is exponential . taking into account the pressure balance at the domain boundary , @xmath86 , we can estimate the decay as @xmath87 with @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the spin healing length .",
    "we can now write down the formula for the tunneling rate in the metastable state @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the distance between the domains and @xmath92 is the attempt rate @xmath93 , with @xmath94 being the speed of sound averaged over the transverse density profile  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the tunneling is greatly suppressed when the distance between the domains is larger than the spin healing length , which determines the spin domain boundary width through the coefficient @xmath95 . in table",
    "[ tab_limit ] we show the ratio of the calculated amount of atoms that tunnel through to the total number of atoms in the middle domain . in the case of the tightest trap",

    ", width=283 ]    the second limitation of the method is related to the minimal size of a domain . for illustration , in fig .",

    "[ fig_switchoff](c ) .",
    "the reason for the absence of the domains is the very steep slope of the density profile close to the barrier . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , in the local density approximation ( lda ) , the spin state at a given point is determined by the value of the atom density at this point .",
    "the @xmath58 atoms can reside only in a very narrow region on the density slope where it is smaller than a certain value .",
