    "the main spectroscopic peculiarity of sn  1991bg was the presence at maximum light of a broad absorption trough at 4100 - 4400    due mostly to lines @xcite , reflecting a lower effective temperature .",
    "as a consequence , sn  1991bg was unusually red ( @xmath5 ) at maximum light .",

    "moreover , the last few years have revealed the existence of several sne  ia which are of an intermediate type between sn  1991 t events and `` normal '' sne  ia . the prototype of these objects , which may be more common than sn  1991t - like events , is sn  1999aa @xcite .",

    "light the spectrum of sn  1999aa had evolved to that of a `` normal '' type  ia supernova .",
    "hence , sn  1999aa - like events would be difficult , if not impossible , to distinguish spectroscopically unless a spectrum were obtained at least a week before maximum .    in order to more fully understand the range of spectroscopic and photometric characteristics of sne  ia , we have organized a number of observing campaigns to obtain optical photometry , infrared photometry , and optical spectroscopy of nearby events ( @xmath6 ) . in this paper , we present observations obtained of the sn  1999aa - like object sn  1999ac .",
    "sn  1999ac was discovered in the sc galaxy ngc  6063 by @xcite from images obtained on 1999 february 26.5 and 27.5 ut .",
    "it was located at ra = 16:07:15.0 , dec = + 07:58:20 ( equinox 2000 ) , some 24 arcsec east and 30 arcsec south of the core of its host .",
    "sn  1999ac was confirmed to be a type  ia supernova by @xcite from a spectrum taken on february 28 ut , who also noted that the spectrum was similar to that of the slow decliner sn  1991 t @xcite . like sn  1991 t",

    "finally , in  5 the conclusions of this investigation are summarized .",
    "optical @xmath7 imaging of sn  1999ac commenced at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) on 1999 march 1 ut , and observations were continued for nearly five months .",
    "three different telescopes  the 0.9  m , 1.5  m , and the yale - aura - lisbon - ohio ( yalo )  1.0  m  were employed .",
    "in addition , three nights of optical imaging were obtained with the apache point obervatory ( apo ) 3.5  m telescope .    in fig .",
    "[ finder ] we show an optical finding chart of the field .",
    "a sequence of local `` standards '' in the supernova field was established from observations obtained on multiple photometric nights .",
    "the @xmath7 magnitudes for these stars are given in table [ standards ] and are tied to observations of @xcite standards obtained on the same nights .",
    "we reduced the optical data for sn  1999ac with respect to the local standards using color coefficients derived from the observations of the landolt stars .",
    "the local standards were verified to be constant over the @xmath85 month duration of our observation .",
    "this method of data reduction allows one to observe the sn even under non - photometric conditions , under the explicit assumption that terrestrial clouds are grey ( i.e. do not selectively filter out light of one color more than another ) . in our experience",
    "this is demonstrably valid as long as the exposures are not extremely short , or the clouds extremely thick . for more on the greyness of terrestrial clouds",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",

    "all magnitudes were determined with daophot @xcite using psf ( point spread function ) photometry on direct , non - subtracted images .",
    "the brightness and location of the sn did not require the use of host galaxy subtraction templates .",
    "near - infrared imaging of sn  1999ac in the @xmath9 bands was obtained over a three month period beginning on the night of 1999 february 28 ut .",
    "most of the data were obtained at the las campanas observatory ( lco ) with the swope 1.0  m and du  pont 2.5  m telescopes . a few images in @xmath10 and @xmath11",
    "were also obtained with the steward observatory ( so ) 2.3  m and 1.5  m telescopes . in a similar manner to the optical photometry , a sequence of local standards was established from observations made with the lco 1.0  m telescope on photometric nights . in table",
    "[ ir_stds ] we give the near infrared magnitudes for the seven field stars , which are tied to the infrared standards of @xcite .",
    "two of these stars ( ir3 and ir7 ) were very red and were too faint in the optical bands to be useful as optical standards , but ir3 was the principal star used to reduce the infrared photometry . from a comparison of the differential magnitudes of ir3 with respect to field stars 1 and 8 , we established that ir3 was constant at the 0.03 mag level during the period of our observations .",
    "the final @xmath9 magnitudes of sn  1999ac are given in table [ ir_photom ] .",
    "these were derived using the same psf photometry software employed for the optical data . since most of the ir imaging was obtained with the lco 1.0  m telescope and infrared camera , which is the very telescope and instrument used to establish the system of standards of @xcite , no color corrections were applied to the ir photometry .",
    "we also note that the system of @xcite uses different filters than the standard j - band and k - band filters . the j@xmath12 and k@xmath12 filters ( where `` s '' stands for `` short '' ) have slightly different effective wavelengths and narrower bandwidths than the corresponding johnson filters .",

    "it may be seen that our optical photometry began @xmath812 days before @xmath1 maximum was reached , providing an uninterrupted record of the rise to peak brightness in each band and continuing without significant gaps to @xmath84 months after @xmath1 maximum . except for the yalo 1.0  m observations , the data obtained with the various telescopes , including the published measurements of @xcite , are in generally good agreement .",
    "the yalo 1.0  m photometry shows significant discrepancies , most notably in the @xmath14 band , but also clearly present in @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath15 , particularly near maximum light .",

    "the differences are even larger and persist during the entire period that the yalo 1.0  m was utilized . in @xmath17 the agreement is the best , but this is fortuitous since the yalo 1.0  m @xmath2 and @xmath15 points are both clearly `` too bright '' at early epochs ( see fig .",
    "[ bvri ] ) .",
    "similar problems with data obtained for other sne  ia with the yalo 1.0  m @xmath14 filter have been documented ; indeed , this filter was replaced in 2001 by a filter which provides a much better match to the kron - cousins system .",
    "problems with sn  ia photometry taken with the yalo @xmath1 and @xmath2 filters have also been observed by @xcite and @xcite . in principle , with precise knowledge of the effective bandpasses of the different telescope / filter / ccd combinations and optical spectrophotometry with sufficient temporal coverage , it should be possible to correct all of the photometry , including the yalo observations , to the standard @xmath13 system as defined by @xcite .",
    "to date , however , attempts to do this have been only partially successful @xcite .",
    "since the yalo data are not needed to plug any critical gaps in the light curves , we can limit ourselves to a consideration of the optical photometry based on the ctio 0.9  m and 1.5  m telescopes .",

    "do the @xmath1-band light curves of these two sne evolve in a similar fashion ; at both earlier and later epochs the light curve of sn  1994d falls below that of sn  1999ac as if sn  1999ac were a slower riser and slower decliner than sn  1994d .",
    "the same is true in the @xmath2 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 bands .    in spite of these indications that sn",
    "1999ac is a slower - declining event than the @xmath19m@xmath20 measurement suggests , the comparisons with the slower declining sne  ia in fig .",

    "the @xmath2-band light curve of sn  1992al ( @xmath19m@xmath20 = 1.11 ) is a reasonable match to the observations of 1999ac .",
    "however , data of sn  1992al in other passbands ( specifically @xmath1 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 ) poorly match sn  1999ac in the same passbands .    note that in @xmath15 , the secondary maximum occurs significantly earlier in sn  1994d than in sn  1999ac , which again indicates that sn  1999ac was effectively a slower decliner than sn  1994d @xcite .",
    "however , the _ strength _ of the secondary maximum is more consistent with a faster - declining sn  ia . following the recipe given by @xcite",
    ", we calculate a flux ( with respect to maximum ) of the secondary maximum between 20 - 40 days after @xmath1 maximum of @xmath21 i @xmath22 = 0.475 , which is good agreement with the expected value for a sn with @xmath19m@xmath23(b ) = 1.33 .",

    "prior to the epoch of @xmath1 maximum , the @xmath3 color of sn  1999ac did not differ significantly from those of the other sne  ia plotted .",
    "however , @xmath85 days after maximum , sn  1999ac began to rapidly grow redder than all of the other sne , reaching a maximum difference in @xmath3 of several tenths of a magnitude by 10 - 15  days past maximum .",
    "by @xmath830 days after maximum , however , the @xmath3 color of sn  1999ac once again resembled that of several of the comparison sne , and continued to evolve in a similar fashion until around day 50 , when the @xmath3 color of sn  1999ac once again began to slowly grow steadily redder than that of the other sne .",
    "the peculiarities in the evolution of the @xmath16 photometry of sn  1999ac are nominally similar to those observed for @xmath3 , with 1999ac starting off reasonably similar to the other events , growing significantly redder between 5 - 25 days after maximum , and then evolving back to a very similar color evolution by day 30 . except for the very first measurements obtained , the @xmath17 evolution of sn  1999ac was redder than that of the reference sne during nearly the entire period covered by our observations .",
    "we call special attention to the fact that the optical color evolution of sn  1999ac was not at all like that of sn  1999aa . in spite of its spectroscopic peculiarities ,",

    "the impression is that , much like the @xmath15-band light curve , the secondary maximum in @xmath24 was actually more of a `` plateau '' rather than a clearly - defined peak .    the maximum light magnitudes in @xmath9 and the corresponding julian dates are listed in table [ maxima ] . as with other well - observed sne  ia , the @xmath9 maxima all occurred @xmath82 - 3 days before @xmath1-band maximum . in @xmath10 and @xmath11 ,",
    "the initial rise to maximum is similar to that observed in @xmath24 .",
    "this is followed in both bands by only a slight decrease in magnitude , to a plateau @xmath810 - 15 days after maximum .",

    "if we maximize the wavelength difference of two `` well behaved '' photometric bands , it is possible to get a better handle on the extinction towards a star or supernova .",
    "@xcite found that sn  ia with mid - range decline rates exhibited uniform v _ minus _ near - ir colors from @xmath40 d , allowing a determination of the v _ minus _ near - ir color excesses and a more robust estimate of a@xmath36 .",
    "@xcite showed that slowly declining sn  ia have v _ minus _ near - ir colors roughly 0.24 mag bluer than those of mid - range decliners .",
    "[ vjhk_colors ] shows that no simple vertical shifting of our v _ minus _ near - ir templates matches the sn  1999ac data from @xmath40 d. if , however , we restrict the fits to the first 20 days after t(@xmath25 ) , we obtain color excesses of e(@xmath28 ) = 0.44 @xmath18 0.08 , e(@xmath29 ) = 0.47 @xmath18 0.06 , and e(@xmath30 ) = 0.37 @xmath18 0.06 . as discussed above in  2.3 , the best behaved photometric band before and after the time of maximum light was @xmath11 .",
    "since the @xmath2-band data in the first weeks after maximum is also well behaved , we would suggest that the most reliable color index from which to derive a color excess and extinction is @xmath30 .",
    "with a@xmath36 = 1.129 @xmath18 0.029 @xmath41 e(@xmath30 ) based on the reddening model of @xcite , we obtain a@xmath36(tot ) = 0.42 @xmath18 0.07 mag .",
    "this implies e(@xmath3)@xmath42 = 0.09 , slightly less than we obtained from optical photometry only .",
    "we shall adopt this smaller value as the best estimate of the host galaxy color excess .    according to @xcite the heliocentric radial velocity of the host of sn  1999ac is 2847 km s@xmath39 .",
    "corrected to the frame of the cosmic microwave background radiation , this velocity is 2942 km s@xmath39 . with a hubble constant of 72 km s@xmath39 mpc@xmath39 @xcite we get a distance modulus of @xmath43 = 33.06 @xmath18 0.22 mag , where the uncertainty corresponds to a random velocity of @xmath18300 km s@xmath39 . if @xmath44 = 14.20 @xmath18 0.02 and a@xmath36 = 0.42 @xmath18 0.07 mag , the absolute magnitude of sn  1999ac is @xmath3119.28 @xmath18 0.24 .",
    "this is 0.24 mag brighter than the value given by @xcite , who assumed zero host galaxy reddening on the basis of the position of the sn in its host and the lack of na i d absorption in the spectra ( li 2005 , private communication ) .",

    ".    the absolute magnitudes of sn  1999ac depend critically on the adopted host galaxy extinction . while this problem is potentially unsolveable in the case of optical absolute magnitudes , serious systematic errors in the extinction corrections are less problematic in the near - ir .",

    "in fig . [ bol ] we show the bolometric light curves of sne  1994d , 1999aa , and 1999ac , calculated using the @xmath48 photometry of @xcite , and our @xmath13 photometry .",

    "as stated above , we assumed a distance modulus @xmath43 = 33.06 mag and e(@xmath3)@xmath42 = 0.09 mag for sn  1999ac .",

    "[ bol ] have essentially the same peak bolometric luminosity . while sne  1994d and 1999ac have the same observed @xmath1-band decline rates , their bolometric decline rates are clearly different .",

    "both sne  1999aa and 1999ac have @xmath19log@xmath49 l@xmath50 @xmath51 1.40 .",
    "taken altogether , the evidence suggests that sn  1999ac was energetically much more similar to the spectroscopically peculiar slow decliner sn  1999aa than to the faster declining sn  1994d .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ bol_drr ] we show the equivalent of the luminosity vs. decline rate relation for sn  ia , but using bolometric light curves .",
    "the ordinate is the logarithm of the peak luminosity , while the abscissa represents the decline in log l over the first 15 days after the bolometric maximum .",
    "sn  1999ac had a peak bolometric luminosity and bolometric decline rate near the mid - range of most of the objects represented .",
    "except for the record - setting slow decliner sn  2001ay @xcite and the faster declining sne  1992a @xcite and 1999by @xcite , sne  ia appear to occupy a rather small parameter space in the bolometric decline rate graph .",
    "this argues in favor of a uniform explosion mechanism for the majority of type ia supernovae .",
    "the type ia supernova 1999ac was peculiar in several respects . as shown by @xcite and by our data ,",
    "the spectra of sn  1999ac resembled the unusual sn  1999aa at early times . from maximum light onward , however , the spectrum was essentially normal .",
    "this underscores a thorny issue of sn classification : if early - time spectra are not obtained , there may be no way to determine if a particular type ia supernova is unusual .",
    "the optical photometry of sn  1999ac was unusual in that it had a slow rise rate ( like sn  1991 t ) , but a much more rapid @xmath1-band decline rate ( like sn  1994d ) . in this sense",
    "it was the opposite of sn  2000cx , which was a rapid riser , but slow decliner .",
    "this is in striking contrast to the @xmath1- and @xmath2-band light curves of most sn  ia which can be characterized by a single stretch factor @xcite . in the case of sn  1999ac , our best estimate of the extinction is obtained from the @xmath30 colors during the first 20 days after t(@xmath25 ) .",
    "we find a@xmath36(tot ) = 0.42 mag , implying a non - zero host galaxy reddening of e(@xmath3)@xmath42 = 0.09 mag .    in spite of the peculiar photometric properties of sn  1999ac ,",
    "because near - infrared extinction corrections are an order of magnitude smaller than at optical wavelengths , the infrared absolute magnitudes of sn  1999ac can not be systematically in error by more than a few hundredths of a magnitude .",
    "the derived infrared absolute magnitudes @xcite are statistically equal to the mean of all other sn  ia with slower decline rates . as a result",
    ", the unusual sn  1999ac can still be regarded as an infrared standard candle .",
    "its @xmath9 light curves were very similar to those of the normal sn  2001el .",
    "the bolometric light curve of sn  1999ac closely resembled that of the spectroscopically peculiar slow decliner sn  1999aa .",
    "the differences of their bolometric luminosities at maximum compared to 90 days after maximum are almost identical . as measured by this parameter ,",
    "sn  1999ac behaved as if it were a slow decliner .",
    "hence , in terms of its energetics and pre - maximum spectral characteristics , there is little doubt that sn  1999ac was closely related to other peculiar , slow - declining events such as sne  1999aa and 1991 t .",
    "finally , we have also examined the luminosity vs. decline rate relation for sn  ia , but considered according to their bolometric light curves .",

    "<S> this supernova was discovered two weeks before maximum light , and observations were begun shortly thereafter . at early times its spectra resembled the unusual sn  1999aa and were characterized by very high velocities in the h&k lines , but very low velocities in the @xmath0 6355 line . </S>",
    "<S> the optical photometry showed a slow rise to peak brightness but , quite peculiarly , was followed by a more rapid decline from maximum . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the @xmath1- and @xmath2-band light curves can not be characterized by a single stretch factor . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the best measure of the nature of this object is _ not _ the decline rate parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 colors were unusual from 30 to 90 days after maximum light in that they evolved to bluer values at a much slower rate than normal type ia supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra and bolometric light curve indicate that this event was similar to the spectroscopically peculiar slow decliner sn  1999aa . </S>"
