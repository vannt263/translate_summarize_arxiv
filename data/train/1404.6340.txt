    "multilayered structures found in the earth s crust can arise from sequences of sedimentary deposits , subsequently held together by the weight of additional overlying layers .",
    "the bending and buckling of such layers during tectonic collision will depend on an intricate mix of complex mechanical and material properties , but also on thoroughly nonlinear constraints coming from the layers being obliged to fit together .",
    "these geometric constraints generate a number of distinctive forms of folding not seen in single - layered systems .",
    "an example of multilayered folding from millook haven in cornwall , uk is shown in fig .  [ fig : rocks ] ( left ) .",
    "if multiple layers of rock are constrained such that they remain in contact during folding , sharp hinges are likely to develop . to see this , we consider first a single layer in the shape of a parabola , fig .",
    "[ fig : rocks ] , and then place further layers of constant thickness on top .",
    "the addition of new layers means the curvature of each tightens in turn until it becomes infinite , marking the presence of a _",
    "swallowtail singularity _",
    "( boon et al .",
    "2007 ) , beyond which layers would need to interpenetrate .",
    "layered systems can accommodate for this singularity by adopting straight limbs punctuated by sharp hinges , as seen in the chevron folds of fig . [",
    "fig : rocks ] . but folding into a sharp hinge can be energetically very expensive , and is often approximated by high rather than infinite curvature regions , separated by distinctively - shaped _ voids _ , into which material from more highly pressurised regions could leach ( dodwell et al . 2012a ) . such veins are termed _ saddle reefs _ ( price & cosgrove 1990 , ramsay 1974 ) , and are commonly found in vertical succession within larger chevron folds ( price & cosgrove 1990 ) .",
    "the formation of voids , or similarly regions of reduced pressure , is of particular economic interest , since they frequently form localised areas in which minerals collect .",
    "a notable field example is the gold - rich quartz deposits of bendigo , australia . here",
    "a sequence of saddle reefs have formed in vertical succession through the hinge region of multiple folds , which have been subsequently filled with quartz and concentrations of gold .",
    "the chevron folds at bendigo have formed directly above a basement that was undergoing prograde metamorphism whilst simultaneously folding .",
    "prograde metamorphism occurs when temperatures and pressures acting on the rock increase ; the rocks then undergo a series of chemical reactions , to form minerals more stable under these conditions .",
    "as hot fluids rise and subsequently cool closer to the earth surface , large convection currents of fluid , known as rayleigh - bernard convection rolls , are generated in the earth s crust .",
    "as the fluid rises and temperatures fall , both minerals and metals become less soluble and can precipitate and be deposited amongst the rock folds .",
    "the voids or saddle reefs , multiple accommodation thrusts and the formation of tension fractures in the outer arc of folds , increase the permeability for fluids through the hinge . over time",
    "this process deposits both quartz and gold into the vertical sequence of voids that have formed .",
    "the mechanics of folding of thinly layered rock systems is a topic of considerable interest in the field of structrual geology .",
    "stemming from the inital geometic observations of multilayered folds most notably by hall ( 1815 ) and van hise ( 1894 ) , various contributions have investigated the mechanics of multilayered folding . in",
    "particularly , biot s contributes on internal buckling instabilites and fold type selection ( biot 1965 ) , ramberg s concept of ` zone contact strain ' to described harmonic folding patterns ( ramsay 1964 , 1970 ) and ramsay s geometric models for chevron fold development ( ramsay 1974 ) .",
    "motivated by the geometric approach of the latter , the authors developed a simplified energy - based model to describe a single void ( dodwell et al .",
    "2012 ) , in which an elastic layer is forced by a uniform overburden pressure @xmath2 into a v - shaped singularity . besides demonstrating various mathematical properties of energy - minimising solutions ( convexity , uniqueness and symmetry ) it was shown that the horizontal measure of the void size varies as @xmath3 . therefore , with the high overburden pressures found in most geological circumstances ( hobbs et al .",
    "1976,price and cosgrove 1990 ) , voids would be expected to be relatively small .",
    "the model has been extended to embrace multilayers of finite length and effects of axial loads ( dodwell et al .",
    "2012b ) , but only in an approximation that assumes constant curvature over the voided regions , and hence contravenes boundary conditions at the points of separation . here , using the same mathematical toolkit , numerical solutions that ensure that these boundary conditions are correctly satisfied .",
    "classically layers of rock are consider viscous or viscous plastic materials ( e.g biot ( 1964 ) , frehner & schmalholz ( 2006 ) , price & cosgrove ( 1990 ) and ramberg ( 1964,1970 ) ) .",
    "purely elastic assumptions are often considered inaccurate for real rock folds ; however more complex rheological models are also a vast simplication of their geological counterparts , which are depend on an intricate balance of nonlinear constutive laws , strain histrory , temperature , pressure and chemcial dependence .",
    "such complexities appears almost impregnable to a mathematical analysis . here",
    "the key focus of the paper is to consider the geometric nonlinearities that naturally arise due to the constraints of layers fitting together during their process .",
    "the assumptions of the layers are linear elastic allows us to isolate the role that the highly nonlinear geometric constraints of layers fitting together has during multilayered folding processes .",
    "the sequence of events leading to multilayered geological structures are extremely complex , and it is often useful to make comparisons against simpler but more readily quantifiable systems .",
    "small scale experiments on layered materials such as paper can provide useful benchmarks , and earlier comparisons have helped to shed light on some naturally occurring phenomena , such as kink - banding ( wadee et al .",
    "2004 ) and parallel folding ( budd et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the experiments described in this paper span a number of years ( dodwell et al .",
    "2012 , wadee et al .",
    "2004 ) , but the general setup is much the same .",
    "in each case , layers of paper ( typically @xmath4 or @xmath5 sheets ) are stacked vertically , with a foam foundation placed on either side .",
    "a simple rig made of plywood holds the stack and foundation together , and the rig can be tightened via g - clamps to add some initial pre - stress into the foundation , applying a transverse overburden pressure @xmath2 per unit length . the rig is placed in an instron testing machine , and a compressive load @xmath6 applied at a constant ( slow ) rate via a motorized load applicator .",
    "figure  [ fig : voidexperiments ] shows four stages during one such experiment , where 750 layers of a6 paper are buckled by a vertical compressive load whilst being constrained laterally by a soft foam foundation . to aid visualization ,",
    "a black - edged sheet has been introduced approximately every 25 layers .",
    "this experiment demonstrates that voiding can be regular .",
    "although the disturbance of introducing black - edged sheets clearly helps to induce voids , they appear in a periodic sequence every five black sheets , or approximately once every 125 layers .    in a similar experiment ,",
    "[ fig:1periodexample ] , with a stiffer surrounding foam , the process of voiding is not as clear .",
    "however , the magnified view of the hinge region on the right shows a void developing for every layer .",
    "these two examples of periodic voiding patterns in the hinge regions of chevron folds are intriguing , and lead to interesting questions .",
    "can we explain for example , why under some conditions voids form regularly at every layer level , whereas for others they repeat only over a large number of layers ? and quantitatively ,",
    "using an energy - based argument , can we predict the periodicity of the voiding ?      to study this periodic behaviour we define an @xmath0-periodic solution in a vertical stack of layers as one in which a single void forms every @xmath0 layers , with the same pattern repeating periodically ; fig .",
    "[ fig : voidexperiments ] shows a 125-periodic solution for example , whereas fig .",
    "[ fig:1periodexample ] is a 1-period solution .",
    "we present a simplified energy - based model for an @xmath7-layered section of a large chevron fold comprising identical elastic layers , arranged into an @xmath0-periodic stack ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : chevronfold ] ) .",
    "the geometry of the chevron fold is assumed to have straight limbs at angle @xmath8 , connected by a convex curved segment . a uniform overburden pressure @xmath2 holds the layers together , while a compressive axial load @xmath6 acts to shorten each layer .",
    "the resulting profiles are obtained by finding convex symmetric energy minimisers of the potential energy functional for the system ( section  [ subsec : tpeandel ] ) , under the constraint that layers do not interpenetrate .",
    "it is assume that layers store energy in bending and against overburden pressure in voiding , while work is done by the axial load @xmath6 .",
    "for this initial simplified model , interactions between layers are considered to be under hard frictionless contact , and constrained energy minimization leads to its representation as a second - order free boundary problem .",
    "section  [ subsec : numerics ] shows that numerical solutions to this free - boundary problem agree with physical intuition , in that with increase in either overburden pressure @xmath2 or axial load @xmath6 , the size of the voids in the multilayered stack decreases . additionally , by finding the energy ( [ eqn : potential ] ) of the solutions for various values of @xmath0 , we show there exists a particular positive integer value of @xmath0 that has minimum energy .",
    "this is then compared with the values observed in the experiments of figs .",
    "[ fig : voidexperiments ] and [ fig:1periodexample ] , using estimated values for all parametric constants , with some degree of success : the analytical model offers good agreement with the experimental values for @xmath0 , and demonstrates that understanding the periodic formation of voids can be intimately linked to the balance of all contributing energies in tight geometric singularities .",
    "this simple extension of previous work on the single layered mode to multilayered configurations can be seen as a first step to the full multilayered model , including the complex geometric constraints arising from the layers being obliged to fit together .",
    "we believe that these highly nonlinear relations drive many of the multilayered patterns observed in true geological structures , and would be essential to any modelling programme .",
    "in this section we set out the model described in this paper , and construct a total potential energy function for the system .",
    "an equilibrium equation is then derived using standard variational methods .",
    "we consider an @xmath7 layered section of a larger chevron fold , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : chevronfold ] , characterised by identical elastic layers of length @xmath9 , uniform thickness @xmath10 , elastic bending stiffness @xmath11 and straight limbs at a constant angle @xmath12 to the horizontal , connected by convex symmetric segments .",
    "the @xmath7 layered stack is arranged into an @xmath0-periodic solution , defined as a sequence of layers that repeats every @xmath13 layer with one void per periodic repeat ; between voids , layers are constrained together to act as _ parallel folds _ ( budd et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the setup and parameters of the model are summarised in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "the centerline or neutral axis of the @xmath14 layer from the bottom of an @xmath0-periodic stack is defined by the vertical displacement @xmath15 , where @xmath16 $ ] is the arc length of the @xmath14 layer , measured from the center of the fold .",
    "displacements of the top and bottom boundary of the layer are labelled @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "intrinsic coordinates are characterised by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the angle the @xmath14 layer makes to the horizontal .",
    "it proves useful also to define the fixed horizontal coordinate @xmath21 within a global cartesian coordinate frame . as an aside ,",
    "both representations have their uses : intrinsic coordinates give simpler equations , but for multilayered problems they carry the added complication of a different coordinate system for each layer .",
    "as seen later , it proves useful to be able to switch freely between coordinate frames .",
    "we also note that , since the assumption is made that the profiles are convex , for any layer there is a one - to - one - to - one relationship between @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath21 .",
    "the _ contact set _ of an @xmath0-periodic structure is defined as the set @xmath24 , whereas its complement is the non - contact set @xmath25 . since profiles are assumed convex , the non - contact set is a single interval ( thm 2.2 , dodwell et al .",
    "the size of the void _ or _",
    "non - contact set is characterized by the free parameter @xmath26 , with the corresponding horizontal measure @xmath27 .",
    "additionally we define the parameters @xmath28 , for @xmath29 .",
    "finally the shortening of a layer from a flat state is defined by the parameter @xmath30 .    throughout this work",
    "we make the assumption of  _ parallel folding _ , such that layers in contact have a constant normal separation of distance @xmath10 between their neutral axes .",
    "since by definition each layer within a single @xmath0-periodic package is in contact with its neighbours , its precise displacement may be calculated in terms of the outside layer @xmath31 ; for example , the position of layer @xmath32 can be determined by propagating layer @xmath31 a distance @xmath33 upwards in its normal direction .",
    "this technique is used through the remainder of this paper , and means that the energy of an @xmath0-periodic package may be written in terms of single layer , @xmath31 , simplifying the variational analysis which follows .",
    "we now construct a total potential energy functional for this system , by considering the contributing energies in turn .",
    "since the profile is assumed to be symmetric , we consider the energy over half the @xmath0-periodic stack , from @xmath34 .      the total bending energy of a single @xmath0-periodic package is the sum of the bending energies of the individual layers .",
    "classic bending theory ( pp.28 , thompson & hunt 1973 ) gives the bending energy over a small segment of beam @xmath35 as @xmath36 , where @xmath23 and @xmath37 are the arc length and curvature of the @xmath14 layer respectively .",
    "integrating each @xmath23 over the curved section of each layer , the total bending energy in an @xmath0 periodic stack is given by , @xmath38 we now proceed to rewrite the bending energy , @xmath39 , in terms of the outside layer @xmath31 . by noting that @xmath40 and",

    "the buckling energy is thus a strongly nonlinear function of the curvature and hence displacement @xmath31 of the reference layer .",
    "the important observation is that the bending energy becomes infinite as @xmath49 approaches @xmath50 , with logarithmic blowup . as a result ,",
    "particularly sharp profiles , or large values of @xmath51 , carry a severe energy penalty .      in experiments with paper , and their geological counterparts ,",
    "the formation voids clearly involves a subtle interplay between release in overburden pressure in these areas , together with some compensatory increase in internal strain energy elsewhere . rather than attempt to model this complex situation directly , we simply assume here that the creation of all voids does work against a constant pressure @xmath2 per unit length , regardless of position in the sample . for an @xmath0-periodic solution , by definition , a single void forms between the @xmath52st and @xmath0th layer , and to determine this area it is convenient to construct the series of complementary areas shown in fig .",

    "the area of a small segment @xmath59 can be calculated using the geometry of a circular arc , fig .",
    "[ fig : segmentvoid ] , given by @xmath60 integrating over the curved section from @xmath61 to @xmath12 , we obtain @xmath62 the total size of the void is given by @xmath63 , and hence the total work done against overburden pressure is @xmath64.\\ ] ]      for the system to remain conservative , the loads at the end of each @xmath0-periodic package must remain both constant and at a fixed angle @xmath12 to the horizontal .",
    "this means that work done by such a load can be measured from any position along its line of action , the difference between two alternative positions being a constant .",

    "once the solution @xmath82 is found using the method described in the previous section , the variation of the solutions with various physical parameters can be investigate using continuation methods . we now consider how the size of the void varies with variations in phyiscal parameters .",
    "firstly we consider the scaling shown by the linear solution , @xmath120 .",
    "for this case the size of the void @xmath105 is fixed by imposing the boundary condition @xmath121 ( i.e. zero bending moment at the point of delamination ) so that @xmath122 where @xmath123 is given by .",

    "the numerical method outlined in the previous section allows one to calculate a range of solutions over different values of @xmath0 , for each of which the potential energy ( [ eqn : potential ] ) can be determined numerically .",

    "this paper highlights the importance to the multilayered systems that appear in many stratified geological situations , of geometric constraints that come from layers being obliged to fit together or nearly so .",

    "the simple energy - based argument describes the periodic formation of voids in the hinge region of chevron folds , where the contributing potential energies are balanced to give a @xmath0 periodic structure with minimum energy .",
    "given that parameter values , particularly for the overburden pressure , are difficult to estimate , the method provides reasonable agreement with two simple experiments on constrained sheets of paper .",
    "the model is of course highly simplified , and many modifications and generalizations can be envisaged .",
    "an important assumption is the pure elasticity of the layers , where there is good reason to consider other material properties ; sharp corners in a bending problem will often imply the formation of plastic hinges , for example dodwell et al . 2012c .",
    "the advantage of such a simplified study , however , is that the appearance and size of voids are precisely defined , and the assumptions of elasticity allow precise analysis .",
    "the inclusion of friction in future models is clearly important , as during the bending and voiding process layers will want to slip over each other",

    "the role of friction will be crucial to multilayered modelling in the future , and will be especially important in the formation of voids .",
    "however , as the frictional forces can switch direction ( budd et al . 2003 ) , and the normal contact force can vary as the voids develop ( hunt et al .",
