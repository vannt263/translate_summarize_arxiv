    "a remarkable prediction of the dirac equation is that a below - barrier electron can pass a large repulsive and _ sharp _ potential step without the exponential damping expected for a non - relativistic particle .",
    "such a transparency effect , originally predicted by klein @xcite and referred to as klein tunneling ( kt ) , arises from the existence of negative - energy solutions of the dirac equation and requires a potential step height @xmath0 of the order of twice the rest energy @xmath1 of the electron @xcite .",
    "relativistic tunneling across a _ smooth _ potential step , which describes the more physical situation of a constant electric field @xmath2 in a finite region of space of length @xmath3 , was subsequently studied by sauter @xcite .",
    "sauter showed that to observe barrier transparency the potential increase @xmath4 should occur over a distance @xmath3 of the order or smaller than the compton wavelength @xmath5 , the transmission probability rapidly decaying toward zero for a smoother potential increase @xcite .",
    "the required field corresponds to the critical field for @xmath6 pair production in vacuum , and its value is extremely strong making the observation of relativistic kt for electrons very challenging .",
    "therefore , growing efforts have been devoted to find experimentally accessible systems to investigate analogs of relativistic kt @xcite .",
    "recently , great interest has suscitated the proposal @xcite and first experimental evidences @xcite of kt for non - relativistic electrons in graphene , which behave like massless dirac fermions . on the other hand ,",
    "optics has offered on many occasions a test bed to investigate the dynamical aspects embodied in a wide variety of coherent quantum phenomena ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) . in optics , several proposals of kt analogs have been suggested as well , including light propagation in deformed honeycomb photonic lattices @xcite whose band structure is similar to the one of graphene @xcite , light refraction at the interface between positive - index and negative - index media @xcite , spatial light propagation in binary waveguide arrays @xcite , and stationary light pulses in an atomic ensemble with electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite .",
    "the experimental implementations of such schemes , however , might be a nontrivial matter , and an experimental observation of kt for photons is still lacking . on the other hand , multilayer and bragg dielectric structures , such as fiber bragg gratings ( fbgs ) ,",
    "are rather simple photonic devices with flexible design that have been successfully demonstrated to provide an accessible laboratory tool to investigate photonic analogues of non - relativistic tunneling phenomena @xcite . here",
    "it is shown that an optical analogue of kt can be achieved in a nonuniform fbg composed by two periodic sections linked by a chirped section which mimics an external potential step in the dirac equation .",
    "such a fbg - based system might be considered the simplest system proposed so far in order to observe klein tunneling in any optical system .",
    "the starting point of our analysis if provided by a standard model of light propagation in a fbg with a longitudinal refractive index @xmath7 $ ] , where @xmath8 is the effective mode index in absence of the grating , @xmath9 is the peak index change of the grating , @xmath10 is the nominal period of the grating defining the reference frequency @xmath11 of bragg scattering , @xmath12 is the speed of light in vacuum , and @xmath13 , @xmath14 describe the slow variation , as compared to the scale of @xmath10 , of normalized amplitude and phase , respectively , of the index modulation . note that the local spatial frequency of the grating is @xmath15 , so that the local chirp rate is @xmath16 .",
    "the periodic index modulation leads to bragg scattering between two counterpropagating waves at frequencies close to @xmath17 . by letting @xmath18 + \\varphi_2(z',t )",

    "the analogy between pulse propagation in the fbg and the dirac equation in presence of an electrostatic field is at best captured by introducing the dimensionless variables @xmath25 and @xmath26 , with characteristic spatial and time scales @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and the new envelopes @xmath29/ \\sqrt 2 $ ] . in this way , eqs.(1 - 2 ) can be cast in the dirac form @xmath30 for the spinor wave function @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the pauli matrices , defined by @xmath34     of height @xmath0 .",

    "( c ) schematic of the grating structure that realizes the optical analogue of relativistic tunneling across a potential step .",
    "the grating comprises five sections , denoted by roman numbers ( from @xmath37 to @xmath38 ) , that are defined by the amplitude @xmath39 and phase gradient @xmath40 grating profiles.,width=309 ]    in its present form , eq.(3 ) is formally analogous to the one - dimensional dirac equation with @xmath41 in presence of an external electrostatic potential @xmath36 , @xmath42 playing the role of a dimensionless ( and generally space - dependent ) rest mass ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . as is well - known , a nonvanishing mass @xmath42 is responsible for the existence of a forbidden energy region , which separates the positive- and negative - energy branches of the massive dirac equation .",
    "the optical analogue of the forbidden energy region is precisely the photonic stop band of the periodic grating . as the refractive index modulation of the grating , i.e. the mass term @xmath42 in the dirac equation ( 3 ) ,",
    "is decreased , the stop band region shrinks and the limit of a massless dirac equation ( similar to the one describing the dynamics of electrons in graphene near a dirac point ) is attained .",
    "the additional external potential @xmath43 in eq.(3 ) , related to the chirp of the grating according to @xmath44 , changes the local position of the forbidden energy region .",
    "therefore , pulse propagation in a fbg with a suitably designed chirp profile can be used to mimic the relativistic tunneling of a wave packet in a potential step @xmath36 .",
    "it should be noted that , as compared to other photonic analogues of kt recently proposed in refs.@xcite and based on _ spatial _ light propagation in periodic photonic structures , the phenomenon of kt occurring in fbgs and discussed in the following section involves the _ temporal _ ( rather than the spatial ) light dynamics and can be therefore simply investigated in the frequency domain by spectrally - resolved transmission measurements .",
    "to realize the analogue of kt , let us first assume that the optical pulse propagates in a region of the grating where @xmath39 is uniform and equal to one , and let us assume a chirp profile that mimics a step potential with an increase from @xmath45 to @xmath46 which occurs over a length @xmath3 ( see fig.1 ) . since for the dirac equation ( 3 ) written in dimensionless units the compton length is @xmath47 and the rest energy is @xmath48 , according to sauter s analysis kt is expected to be observable for @xmath3 smaller than @xmath49 and for a potential height @xmath0 larger than @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "the process of kt and tunneling inhibition for a smooth potential step can be simply explained by a graphical analysis of the space - energy diagrams @xmath51 of the one - dimensional dirac equation @xcite , which are shown in figs.1(a ) and ( b ) for a sharp and for a smooth potential step , respectively . for the sake of clearness , in the figures",
    "the potential @xmath36 has been chosen to yield a nonvanishing and constant chirp rate over a length @xmath3 ; different forms for the potential step , such as the profile @xmath52 $ ] considered in the seminal work by sauter @xcite , can be assumed as well without changing the main results .",

    "the gap regions are visualized in the diagrams by the shaded areas . a wave packet ( optical pulse ) in the electron branch with an initial mean energy @xmath35 ( @xmath61 ) coming from @xmath62 tunnels into the @xmath63 region after crossing a forbidden energy region , indicated by the bold segment ab in fig.1(b ) , which vanishes for a sharp potential step [ @xmath64 , see fig.1(a ) ] . according to sauter s analysis @xcite ,",
    "the tunneling probability is appreciable provided that @xmath3 is smaller than @xmath49 . in the fbg context , the energy diagrams of fig.1 are equivalent to the band - reflection diagrams introduced by poladian for a graphical analysis of nonuniform gratings @xcite , where the energy @xmath65 represents the frequency detuning of the incoming wave from the bragg frequency @xmath17 .",
    "the sauter s condition @xmath66 for kt can be derived following the analysis of ref.@xcite by computation of the transmittance of the effective grating associated to the evanescent region ab shown in fig.1(b ) ( see sec.v.a of ref.@xcite ) . in the previous discussion",
    ", we assumed @xmath67 , however for a grating with finite spatial extent one has @xmath68 as @xmath69 . to inject and to eject the optical pulse into the @xmath67 grating region around @xmath70 , an input and an output apodization sections",
    "can be introduced , which adiabatically convert the input and output wave packets from the @xmath71 regions into the @xmath67 grating region ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "therefore , the general structure of the fbg that realizes a photonic analogue of relativistic tunneling across a potential step consists of five sections , as shown in fig.1(c ) : two boundary apodization sections ( regions i and v ) , and two uniform sections ( regions ii and iv ) separated by a central chirped section of length @xmath72 ( region iii ) . in figs .",
    "2(a - c ) typical examples of pulse tunneling across the potential step @xmath73 $ ] are presented , showing kt for a sharp potential step [ fig.2(a ) ] and inhibition of tunneling as the step gets smooth [ fig.2(b ) and ( c ) ] .",
    "the figures depict the temporal evolution of @xmath74 -which is proportional to the field intensity averaged in time over a few optical cycles and in space over a few wavelengths- as obtained by numerical analysis of eqs.(1 ) and ( 2 ) for a grating length of @xmath75 with a quarter - cosine apodization profile [ see fig.2(d ) ] , @xmath53 , and for a few values of @xmath3 . a forward - propagating gaussian pulse @xmath20 of mean energy @xmath76 coming from @xmath77 and of duration ( fwhm in intensity ) @xmath78 has been assumed as an initial condition .",
    "for typical parameter values @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 nm , which apply to fbgs used in optical communications , the spatial and temporal scales in fig.2 are @xmath82 mm and @xmath83 ps , respectively .",
    "hence , in physical units the grating length is @xmath84 cm , whereas the optical analogue of the compton length is @xmath85 mm .",
    "such nonuniform fbg structures should be realizable with current fbg technology based on uv continuous laser writing @xcite .",
    "it should be finally noticed that , as in an experiment the tracing of pulse evolution in the grating ( fig.2 ) can be a nontrivial task , the signatures of kt can be simply obtained from standard spectral transmission measurements of the grating .",
    "in fact , for a given value of @xmath86 and according to the band diagram of fig.1(a ) , in the kt regime a transmission window at @xmath87 [ the segment ab in fig.1(a ) ] , embedded into the two gaps @xmath88 and @xmath89 [ the segments bc and ad in fig.1(a ) ] should be observed in the transmission spectrum , the suppression of kt for a smooth potential corresponding to the lowering of such a transmission window .",
    "this is clearly shown in fig.3 , where the spectral transmittance of the fbgs corresponding to the simulations of figs.2(a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) are depicted .",
    "note that , as the length @xmath3 of the chirped region is increased [ from fig.3(a ) to 3(c ) ] , the transmission window embedded in the two adjacent gaps disappears , which is the signature of kt inhibition .",

    "in conclusion , a photonic analogue of klein tunneling based on pulse propagation in nonuniform fiber bragg gratings has been proposed . as compared to other photonic analogues of kt",

    "@xcite and based on spatial light propagation in periodic photonic structures , the phenomenon of kt in fbgs suggested in this work can be simply observed in the frequency domain as the opening of a transmission window inside the grating stop band , provided that the impressed chirp is realized over a length of the order of the analogue of the compton wavelength .",
