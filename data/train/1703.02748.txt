    "determining how well a particular graph is connected is a problem that arises often in various applications .",
    "for example , as defined in @xcite , _ resilience _ is the ability of a network to provide and maintain an acceptable level of service in the face of various faults and challenges to normal operation .",
    "examples of such networks include telecommunication networks , electrical grids , and commodity supply networks .",
    "one of the scientific disciplines that forms the basis of resilience is _ disruption tolerance _  the ability of a system to tolerate disruptions in connectivity among its components ; such disruptions could consist of environmental challenges such as weak and episodic channel connectivity , mobility , and unpredictably - long delay , as well as tolerance of energy challenges @xcite . the most common way to interpret such networks is as connected graphs , where the resilience of a network as a function of its disruption tolerance can be studied by analyzing the connectivity properties of the associated graph .",
    "graph connectivity has also been shown to play an important role in data security ; see @xcite and the references therein for more information .    in 1973 , fiedler related the vertex - connectivity of a graph to the second - smallest eigenvalue of its laplacian matrix in the following way ( see section  [ preliminaries ] for relevant definitions ) :    [ thm1.1 ] @xcite if @xmath0 is a simple , non - complete graph , then @xmath1 .",
    "note that theorem [ thm1.1 ] also implies @xmath2 , since @xmath3 . this seminal result provided researchers with another parameter that quantitatively measures the connectivity of a graph",
    "; hence , @xmath4 is known as the _ algebraic connectivity _ of @xmath0 .",
    "fiedler s discovery ignited interest in studying the connectivity of graphs by analyzing the spectral properties of their associated matrices .",
    "akin to other connectivity measures such as vertex - connectivity , edge - connectivity , and isoperimetric number , the algebraic connectivity of a graph has applications in the design of reliable communication networks @xcite and in analyzing the robustness of complex networks @xcite .",
    "recall that for a @xmath5-regular multigraph @xmath0 on @xmath6 vertices , @xmath7 for @xmath8 .",
    "thus , for regular multigraphs , spectral bounds related to connectivity are often expressed in terms of the second - largest eigenvalue , instead of the second - smallest laplacian eigenvalue .",
    "we now discuss several results relating the vertex- and edge - connectivity of graphs to their second - largest eigenvalues , which are similar in nature to the main results of the present paper .",
    "the following result of chandran @xcite relates the second - largest eigenvalue of an @xmath6-vertex @xmath5-regular graph to its edge - connectivity .",
    "@xcite let @xmath0 be an @xmath6-vertex @xmath5-regular simple graph with @xmath9 . then @xmath10 .    in 2006 ,",

    "the value of @xmath16 above is approximately @xmath20 . for @xmath21 , it is still an open problem to find the best upper bound for @xmath22 in a @xmath5-regular simple graph @xmath0 to guarantee that @xmath23 .",
    "[ cioba improvement for t=2 ] @xcite let @xmath15 be any integer .",
    "let @xmath0 be a @xmath5-regular , simple graph with @xmath24 then @xmath25 .",
    "the value of @xmath26 above is approximately @xmath27 .    in 2016 , o @xcite generalized fiedler s result to multigraphs , and established similar bounds as those above .",
    "[ o , bound 1 for multigraphs ] @xcite let @xmath0 be a connected , @xmath5-regular multigraph with @xmath28 then @xmath19 .",
    "[ o , bound 2 for multigraphs ] @xcite let @xmath29 and let @xmath0 be a connected , @xmath5-regular multigraph . if @xmath30 , then @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath12 is odd and @xmath31 , then @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , for every positive integer @xmath12 less than @xmath5 , o @xcite found the best upper bound for @xmath22 to guarantee that @xmath32 .",
    "note that the bounds for @xmath22 in theorems [ cioba improvement for t=1 ] and [ cioba improvement for t=2 ] are larger than those in theorems [ o , bound 1 for multigraphs ] and [ o , bound 2 for multigraphs ] ; this suggests that if multiple edges are not allowed , then a bound for @xmath22 that will guarantee a desired edge - connectivity may be larger .",
    "hence , we see that a @xmath5-regular multigraph @xmath0 may have high edge - connectivity while @xmath22 is small ; this supports the implicit meaning of cheeger s inequality ( see @xcite ) for a @xmath5-regular multigraph @xmath0 , which asserts that @xmath33 where @xmath34}{|s|}.\\ ] ] the cheeger constant @xmath35 ( also known as the isoperimetric number ) can be considered as an approximation to the edge - connectivity of @xmath0 .",
    "the results above make assertions about the edge - connectivity of a graph based on its eigenvalues . in a more recent paper , o @xcite also established analogous results for vertex - connectivity .",
    "@xcite let @xmath0 be a @xmath5-regular multigraph that is not the @xmath36-vertex @xmath5-regular multigraph .",
    "if @xmath37 , then @xmath38 .",
    "algebraic connectivity has also been studied in the context of hypergraphs @xcite and directed graphs @xcite .",
    "see @xcite and the bibliographies therein for other recent results on algebraic connectivity , more general structural results on vertex- and edge - connectivity , and other algebraic measures of connectivity .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to investigate what upper bounds on the second - largest eigenvalues of regular simple graphs and multigraphs guarantee a desired vertex- or edge - connectivity .",
    "in other words , we address the following question :    for a @xmath5-regular simple graph or multigraph @xmath0 and for @xmath39 , what is the best upper bound for @xmath22 which guarantees that @xmath14 or that @xmath40 ?",
    "the majority of the related results listed above were derived using a variety of combinatorial , linear algebraic , and analytic techniques ; moreover , they feature upper bounds for @xmath22 which do not depend on the order of the graph . in contrast , the results derived in the present paper feature bounds for @xmath22 which depend on both the degree and the order of the graphs , and as such are tight for infinite families of graphs .",
    "furthermore , the derivations of these results combine analytic techniques with computer - aided _ symbolic _ algebra ; this proves to be a powerful approach , easily establishing the desired results in all but finitely - many cases .",
    "the remaining cases are verified through a brute - force approach which relies on enumerating all multigraphs with certain properties . in order to avoid enumeration and post - hoc elimination of the exponential number of multigraphs without the desired properties , our approach required the development of novel combinatorial and graph theoretic techniques . while the problem of generating all non - isomorphic simple graphs having a certain degree sequence and other properties is well - studied ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , there are not as many efficiently - implemented algorithms for constrained enumeration of multigraphs ( see @xcite for some results in this direction ) .",
    "thus , the developed enumeration procedure may also be of independent interest .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we recall some graph theoretic and linear algebraic notions , specifically those related to eigenvalue interlacing . in sections 3 and 4 , respectively , we give spectral bounds which guarantee a certain vertex- and edge - connectivity .",
    "we conclude with some final remarks and open questions in section 5 .",
    "the appendix includes further details and computer code for symbolic computations used in some of the proofs .",
