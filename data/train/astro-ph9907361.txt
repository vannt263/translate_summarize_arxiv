    "at a present day mass of @xmath2m@xmath3 and a luminosity of @xmath4l@xmath3 ( humphreys & davidson 1994 , davidson & humphreys 1997 ) @xmath0 carinae tops the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) and is certainly among the most massive stars observed as yet . even if the recently re - discussed binary hypothesis for @xmath0 car ( damineli 1996 , damineli et al .",
    "1997 , davidson 1997 ) should turn out to apply , at least one component has to have a mass exceeding @xmath5m@xmath3 , which again puts it into the realm of the most massive stars .",
    "@xmath0 car is a member of the stellar class of _ luminous blue variables _ ( lbvs ) , which start as main - sequence o stars with masses @xmath6 @xmath7m@xmath3 ; these stars evolve towards cooler temperatures at the end of hydrogen - core burning and may enter an unstable phase at an age of roughly 310@xmath8 years ( langer et al . 1994 ) .",
    "this so - called lbv phase starts when the stars reach the humphreys - davidson limit ( humphreys & davidson 1979 , 1994 ) in the hrd .",
    "analyzing hrds of the galaxy and the lmc , humphreys ( 1978 , 1979 ) and humphreys & davidson ( 1979 ) found a lack of very luminous red supergiants .",
    "obviously the most massive stars do not evolve into red supergiants but instead their evolution is reversed towards the blue supergiant part in the hrd when they approach the humphreys - davidson limit as lbvs .",
    "one of the most prominent characteristics of the unstable lbv phase is a very high mass loss rate ( characteristically about several @xmath9m@xmath10 with values even higher during giant eruptions ) .",
    "strong stellar winds and giant eruptions peel off parts of the stellar envelope and form small circumstellar nebulae around lbvs , so - called lbv nebulae ( lbvn ; nota et al .",
    "1995 ) . in the same manner @xmath0 car formed its nebula in a quite dramatic way .",
    "having been a @xmath11  star for a long time ( with only small changes ) @xmath0 car drastically brightened around 1843 ad ( herschel 1847 , innes 1903 , van genderen & th 1984 , viotti 1995 ) and became a @xmath121  star for about 5 years .",
    "this giant eruption led to the formation of a nebula that was found only a century later .",
    "nearly simultaneously gaviola ( 1946 , 1950 ) and thackeray ( 1949 , 1950 ) photographed the nebula for the first time . because of its odd man - like shape gaviola named it the _",
    "homunculus_. later it became clear that the homunculus is only the brightest region of a larger bipolar nebula , consisting of two lobes of @xmath13  diameter each .",
    "they are separated by an equatorial plane structure ( duschl et al .",
    "the high resolution hubble space telescope ( hst , morse et al .",
    "1998 ) images support this model , showing clearly the bipolarity of the homunculus . the deepest hst pictures ( 200s in the f656 and f658n filters ) reveal an even larger nebula consisting of a variety of filamentary structures like knots , arcs and strings at a distance of up to 30  from @xmath0 car .",
    "the sizes of filaments vary in a wide range from fractions of an arcsecond to several arcseconds .",
    "analysis of the kinematics of the homunculus and the filaments has contributed considerably to the understanding of the structure and nature of the nebula .",
    "radial velocity ( meaburn et al .  1987 , 1993 , 1996 , hillier & allen 1992 ) and proper motion ( walborn 1976 , walborn et al . 1978 , walborn & blanco 1988 , currie et al .  1996 , smith & gherz 1998 ) measurements revealed velocities up to @xmath14    a comprehensive study of the full outer filamentary nebula of @xmath0 car will be found in weis & duschl ( 1999 , in prep . ) . in the present paper",
    "we concentrate on several very narrow , long and coherent structures which we will refer to as _ strings_. as yet , we investigated in detail the morphology of the 5 most prominent strings .",
    "moreover , we show additional kinematic analysis of 3 of these strings , including a full velocity coverage of the longest string . with the high - resolution images of the hst it was possible for the first time to study the lbvn of @xmath0 car in such a detail that structures as narrow as the strings could be resolved and analyzed .",
    "this paper describes the morphology of the strings and presents their kinematic properties .",
    "we also discuss possible formation mechnism of the strings and address their uniqueness .",
    "all strings were first detected in the high - resolution images of the homunculus nebula made with the hst , as yet the only telescope able to resolve such small scale structures ( width : 02 - 04 or @xmath15pc ) .",
    "all hst images we used were taken from the canadian astrophysics data center ( cadc ) archive and were recalibrated using their optimal calibration data .",
    "we retrieved all frames obtained in the f656n ( h@xmath16 ) and f658n ( [ nii ] ) filters .",
    "the strings were not visible in any other filters . in each filter",
    "the observations were carried out with three different exposure times , 0.011 , 4 and 200s . for reduction , combination of the images and cosmic - ray cleaning we followed the standard procedures recommended for wfpc2 data .",
    "frames of the same filter were combined weighting and scaling with the exposure time and used to correct the bleeding by substituting the pixels with bleeding by pixels from frames with a lower exposure time . since most of the features seen in the nebula around @xmath0 carinae have expansion velocities of several @xmath17kms@xmath18 ( meaburn et al .",
    "1987 , 1996 , hillier & allen 1992 , weis et al .  in prep .",
    ", and this paper ) many of the features seen in the f656n filter are contaminated by blueshifted [ nii]-emission at 6583 and emission seen in the f658n filter originates in redshifted emission from the h@xmath16 line . due to the doppler shifts ,",
    "the two filters are no longer genuine h@xmath16 and [ nii ] filters for the expanding material of @xmath0 car .",
    "this effect is also responsible for the wavelength - dependent length of string 1 , which is longer in the f656n than in the f658n image .",
    "while we only show images of the f656n filter in the paper we always compare the measured sizes in both narrow band images , keeping the doppler shifts in mind .",
    "figure [ fig : strings ] shows a 60@xmath19 60  section of the final f656n wfpc2 frame . a north - east vector indicates the celestial directions .",
    "we restrained from rotating the images because of the loss of resolution when using the iraf rotation task .",
    "all images therefore have the original hst sampling of 00455 pixel@xmath18 for the pc and 00996 pixel@xmath18 for the wfc .      to obtain kinematic information on the strings we used the echelle spectrograph on the 4 m telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory .",
    "we observed in the long - slit mode , inserting a post - slit h@xmath16 filter ( 6563/75 ) and replaced the cross - disperser with a flat mirror .",
    "the 79lmm@xmath18 echelle grating was used , where the slit - width was 250@xmath20 m ( @xmath21 ) resulting in an instrumental fwhm at the h@xmath16 line of about 14kms@xmath18 .",
    "data were recorded with the long focus red camera and the @xmath22 tek2k4 ccd was used .",
    "the pixel size was 0.08pixel@xmath18 along the dispersion , and 0@xmath2326pixel@xmath18 on the spatial axis .",
    "due to vignetting , the slit length was limited to @xmath24 .",
    "seeing was @xmath25 during the observations and the weather was not photometric .",
    "thorium - argon comparison lamp frames were taken for wavelength calibration and geometric distortion correction .",
    "the slit positions were referenced with respect to th et al.s ( 1980 ) star # 66 in the trumpler 16 cluster .",
    "five positions were observed covering three of the five visually identified strings .",
    "the spectra were taken 30 , 32 , 34 , 36 , and 38  south of our reference star ( slits 30s , 32s , 34s , 36s , and 38s , respectively ) . the slit was rotated to a position angle of pa@xmath26 to aligne it with the major axis of the homunculus nebula and the general direction of the strings .",
    "figures [ fig : echellograms ] a - e show the spectra at the five positions , the strings are marked .",
    "the exposure time was 30s for slit 30s , 90s for slit 32s and 180s for the slits 34s , 36s and 38s .",
    "a large number of filamentary structures can be identified in the deep hst picture of the homunculus nebula around @xmath0 car . among all these morphologically different structures a few long , coherent and very narrow features are the most amazing objects we found .",
    "these features are the above introduced _",
    "strings_. we identified 5 such strings by visual inspection . on smaller length scales , morphologically similar features can be seen ( weis & duschl 1999 in prep . ) .",
    "however , due to confusion with background emission in the spectra , a detailed analysis was not possible in the work presented here .",
    "of those 5 strings 3 were found in the south - eastern , and 2 in the north - western part of the nebula .",
    "none were detected in the other two quadrants .",
    "the strings are marked and named in fig .",
    "[ fig : strings ] .",
    "a blowup of the hst image in fig .",
    "[ fig : blow125 ] gives a closer view of strings 1 , 2 and 5 while fig .",
    "[ fig : blow34 ] shows string 3 and 4 in more detail .",
    "the observed lengths of the strings range between 40 and 159 . towards the center of @xmath0 car",
    "we can not distinguish the strings from the overall emission of other knots and filaments . at the very end of the strings",
    "the surface brightness decreases , and the strings might extend further at a level below the detection limit . therefore , the far end of the strings is not well determined , and all measured lengths are only lower limits .    to determine the lengths of the strings we adopt a distance of 2.3kpc to @xmath0 car ( walborn 1995 , davidson & humphreys 1997 ) .",
    "however , the distance to the carina hii region still has not been accurately determined because of the strong and variable reddening in this region . in the following ,",
    "all sizes are measured as a width at the base rather than fwhm .",
    "_ string 1 _ lies in the south - eastern part of the nebula ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : strings ] and [ fig : blow125 ] ) and is the longest of all detected .",
    "the total measured length is @xmath27au .",
    "this length is comparable to the combined size of the two lobes of the central bipolar nebula .",
    "we used the pc f658n images to determine the width of string 1 . in this image the inner part ( closer to @xmath0 car ) of the string was resolved .",
    "the images show a width of about 5 pixels , corresponding to @xmath28 au ) .",
    "the resolution of the wfc is insufficient ; at 2 pixels the strings can not be reliably resolved , but the wfc image suggests that the width does not change significantly along the string .",
    "this leads to a length - to - width ratio of @xmath29 70 .",
    "if the string extends all the way to the star , an assumption supported by the orientation of the string with respect to @xmath0 car , the total projected length of the string is @xmath30au and the length - to - width ratio would be 128 .",
    "however , in the following , when not stated explicitly otherwise , we always give the observed rather than the extrapolated length - to - width ratio , i.e. , a lower limit for this quantity .",
    "even though string 1 seems very straight , small , almost periodic wiggles occur at a scale of several arcseconds as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : blow125 ] . at its inner end",
    ", string 1 seems either to have a split of a length of @xmath31 or to be projected onto another string - like feature in the fore- or background .",
    "the intensity varies along the string and decreases rapidly at its outer end .",
    "no periodic or symmetric variations were found .",
    "note that string 1 corresponds to the structure called _ jet _ and _ spike _ by meaburn et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and meaburn et al.(1996 ) , respectively .    _",
    "string 2 _ is shorter than string 1 and has a higher surface brightness .",
    "it lies close to string 1 in the south - eastern part of the nebula .",
    "string 2 is 40 long ( @xmath32au ) .",
    "the width was determined in the same way as for string 1 .",
    "a total width of 013 ( @xmath33au ) was derived leading to a length - to - width ratio of 31 .",
    "the string s far end is located 165 ( @xmath34au ) from the star .",
    "the morphology of string 2 is very different from that of string 1 .",
    "in contrast to the nearly straight line image of string 1 , string 2 shows a prominent kink ( fig .",
    "[ fig : blow125 ] ) where the direction of the string changes by 22@xmath352 .",
    "string 2 has a more uniform surface brightness and has a clearer end where the surface brightness drops abruptly .    _",
    "string 3 _ is one of the two strings found in the north - western part of the homunculus nebula ( fig.[fig : blow34 ] ) .",
    "we derive a length of 76 ( @xmath36au ) .",
    "the string is covered in both the wfc and the pc images in its full length , so that the width of the string over its entire observed length can be measured .",
    "the width is @xmath37pc ( @xmath38au ) and does not change significantly along the string .",
    "this results in a length - to - width ratio of 42 . extrapolating the string back to the star we derive a length of 170 ( @xmath39au ) .",
    "string 3 is the straightest of all strings and shows only one small wiggle at its outer end .",
    "the string s surface brightness is very homogenous , showing nearly no changes in its intensity .    _",
    "string 4 _ lies close to string 3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : blow34 ] ) and has similar parameters .",
    "its length amounts to 93 ( @xmath40au ) .",
    "the width measured on the pc image is 014 ( @xmath41au ) and is approximately constant along the string .",
    "the ratio of length - to - width is 68 .",
    "altogether , the string extends 187 ( @xmath42au ) from the star .",
    "string 4 bends and wiggles slightly but less frequently than string 1 .",
    "_ string 5 _ is much harder to identify due to its low surface brightness .",
    "this might also be the reason why it seems less coherent and hard to resolve .",
    "it might easily be mistaken as a number of individual filaments .",
    "string 5 was measured to be 52 long ( @xmath43au ) and 014 ( @xmath44au ) wide .",
    "this gives a length - to - width ratio of 38 .",
    "a length of 187 ( @xmath45au ) was obtained for the full distance from @xmath0 car to the outer end of string 5 .",
    "string 5 shows more brightness variations along its extension than the others , giving it a somewhat knotty appearance .",
    "the three brightest regions of the string can be identified in fig .",
    "[ fig : blow125 ] .",
    "string 5 shows one larger bend , but no small scale wiggles are found .",
    "even though many of the lbvn show small scale structures and knots , no strings were found in other lbvns . in particular for ag car and hr car , on hst images one should be able to detect narrow strings of the type seen around @xmath0 car , but none were found . in the light of the ongoing discussion about morphological and physical similarities and relations between lbvn and planetary nebulae ( see ,",
    "e.g. , frank et al .  1998 ,",
    "frank 1998 , currie & dowling 1999 ) , it is of interest to look into the question whether the strings and their properties are unique to lbvns .",
    "we re - analyzed the hst images of ngc 6543 from the cadc archive ( [ nii ] f658n filter ) and found at least 5 ( possibly 2 more ) features ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pn ] ) that resemble our strings very much ( see also in harrington & borkowki 1994 , 1995 ) . the pc again allowed us to determine the width of the strings between 2 - 8 pixel . assuming a distance to ngc6543 of 1170pc ( castor et al .",
    "1981 ) we found that the string lengths are 35 10@xmath46 to 43 10@xmath46pc while they are 0.5 10@xmath46 to 2.1 10@xmath46pc wide ( table [ tab : pn ] ) .",
    "their length - to - width ratios range from 22 to 82 . comparing these string - like structures with the strings in @xmath0 car",
    "we conclude that they show approximately the same morphology .",
    "the linear sizes are comparable .",
    "a comparison between these pn - strings and the ones in lbvs , which we discussed in the present paper , will be of utmost importance as it has the potential of yielding insight into the differences and into the similarities in the formation processes of nebular structures around evolved high ( lbv ) and low ( pn ) mass stars .",
