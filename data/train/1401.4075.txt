    "the standard hubbard model on the shastry - sutherland lattice can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator ; @xmath10 is the number operator ; @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is the nearest - neighbor ( the diagonal ) hopping energy as shown in fig .",
    "@xmath13 is the hubbard interaction strength .",
    "@xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) runs over the nearest - neighbor links ( the diagonal links ) on the lattice .",
    "we set @xmath16 as the energy unit , and @xmath12 hence can be seen as a measure of the frustration strength .",
    "we focus on the half - filling case i.e. @xmath17 , which is realized by adjusting the chemical potential @xmath18 .",
    "we shall start from the non - interacting case with @xmath19 . in this case , the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "can be partially diagonalized in momentum space as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 .",
    "the index @xmath22 in @xmath23 represent the four sites in each unit cell as illustrated in fig .  1 ( b ) , and @xmath24 locates in the first brillouin zone .",
    "@xmath25 is a @xmath26 matrix that has a form , @xmath27    the band dispersion is readily obtained by diagonalizing this matrix . a special case with @xmath28 is shown in fig .  1 ( d ) , where there are four bands resulting from the four sub - lattices",
    ". we label them i ii iii and iv from top to bottom , among which band ii and iii touch at @xmath29 point ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "band ii has its minimum at @xmath29 and two diagonals in the first brillouin zone , which result in a von hove singularity right at half filling in the density of states as shown in fig .",
    "in addition , we show in fig .",
    "2 the evolution of the band dispersions along the high symmetry lines of the first brillouin zone with respect to @xmath31 .",
    "it can be seen that there are several things in common for the dispersions at different @xmath31 s .",
    "for example , the band is a flat along the diagonal of the first brillouin zone . along the boundary of the first brillouin zone ,",
    "band i and ii as well as band iii and iv are degenerate .",
    "besides , when @xmath32 , there is a gap opened between band ii and iii , and the system becomes a band insulator at half - filling .",
    "as we are focusing on the mott transition , we limit our studies to the case when @xmath33 in this report .",
    "now we turn to the case when the hubbard interaction is represent ( i.e. @xmath34 ) .",
    "a large u can induce a large energy cost when two electrons occupy the same site , leading to a decreasing double occupancy .",
    "consequently , at half filling electrons tends to get localized with one electron per site and when @xmath13 is large enough the system becomes an insulator with gap in the single - particle electron spectrum , known as the mott metal - insulator transition . in order to identify the mott transition of the shastry - sutherland lattice , we calculated the density of states ( dos ) at different interaction strength by the maximum entropy method @xcite with different temperature and frustration . in fig",
    "3(a ) , we show the dos for @xmath35 .",
    "it can be seen that when @xmath36 a fermi - liquid - like peak is found near fermi energy , which splits to a pseudogap when @xmath13 is increased to @xmath37@xcite . when @xmath13 increases up to the critical point @xmath38 an obvious gap appears around the fermi level which suggests the system undergoes a mott transition from a metal to a mott insulator .",
    "3(b ) we plot the dos at @xmath39 with @xmath28 and we can see that the transition point at @xmath39 decreases to @xmath40 compared with @xmath38 when @xmath41 , which is because the decreasing of temperature suppresses the thermal fluctuations and makes the mott transition easier . by comparing figs .",
    "3(b)-3(d ) , it is found out that the critical interaction of mott transition increases when the frustration becomes stronger .",
    "the double occupancy @xmath42 represents the probability of two particles occupying the same site .",
    "the evolution of @xmath43 as a function of @xmath13 at different temperature is shown in fig .",
    "4 . it can be seen that as @xmath13 increases , @xmath43 decreases monotonically to a small value , which is a characteristic feature of the mott transition @xcite , indicating that the system is almost singly occupied at large @xmath13 .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath43 has no visible discontinuities at the critical points marked with arrows , suggesting that the mott transition here is continuous .",
    "we also observe a natural decrease of the critical @xmath13 when the temperature decreases , which suppresses the thermal fluctuations . besides , the evolution of docc as a function of the frustration strength for different @xmath13 is shown in the inset of fig .  4 , and it can be seen that the double occupancy is increased with increasing @xmath31 or decreasing @xmath13 .    there is usually magnetic order developed along with the mott metal - insulator transition .",
    "in order to investigate the formation of the magnetic order , we define a staggered magnetic order parameter as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 if @xmath46 and @xmath47 if @xmath48 as shown in fig .",
    "5 shows the evolution of this staggered magnetic order parameter @xmath49 and the single - particle gap @xmath50 as a function of @xmath13 for @xmath39 , with @xmath28 .",
    "when @xmath51 both the staggered magnetic order parameter and the single - particle gap vanish when , and the system is in a paramagnetic metal phase .",
    "when @xmath52 , the magnetic order forms while the single - particle excitation is still gapless , implying the system is in an antiferromagnetic metal phase .",
    "when @xmath13 increases to @xmath53 , a gap opens , and the system goese into an antiferromagnetic insulator phase . in the inset of fig .  5 , we also show the case when @xmath54 .",
    "there only exists the metal - insulator transition at @xmath55 , and all magnetic orders are suppressed due to strong frustration .    carrying out the analysis above in a wide range of parameters , phase diagrams of interacting fermions on the shastry - sutherland lattice with respect to interaction , frustration , and temperature",
    "are obtained in figs .  6 and 7 .",
    "we first show the effect of frustration @xmath31 and interaction @xmath13 at a low enough temperature @xmath39 ( see fig .",
    "when @xmath56 , the shastry - sutherland lattice degenerates to a square lattice , which is unstable towards an antiferromagnetic phase for an arbitrarily small interaction due to the perfect nesting of the fermi surface , and the magnetic order is always accompanied by a mott insulating gap@xcite . in fig .",
    "6 , the finite critical @xmath13 which is around 2.9 when @xmath56 is due to the finite temperature . in the presence of frustration ,",
    "when @xmath13 increases , instead of going directly into the antiferromagnetic insulator phase from the paramagnetic metal phase , the system first enters an antiferromagnetic metal phase , showing an important role that frustration plays in the formation of an antiferromagnetic metal @xcite .",
    "when @xmath57 the antiferromagnetic metal phase disappear and a paramagnetic insulator phase emerges for @xmath58 .",
    "the critical frustration @xmath59 obtained here is consistent with the one obtained from the calculations of the two dimensional heisenberg model on the shastry - sutherland lattice , beyond which the ground state of the system was shown to become a valence bond solid@xcite .",
    "we will return to this later in more details in the discussion part .",
    "we also obtain phase diagrams showing the effects of thermal fluctuations at a fixed frustration strength @xmath28 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the antiferromagnetic metal phase exists when @xmath60 , and a phase transition from antiferromagnetic metal to antiferromagnetic insulator is found when @xmath13 is kept increasing .",
    "when temperature is high , magnetic orders are suppressed by thermal fluctuations , and the system undergoes a transition from a paramagnetic metal phase to a paramagnetic insulator phase with increasing interaction . additionally , we plot the phase digram with frustration up to @xmath61 in the inset of fig .",
    "it is shown that due to the strong frustration , magnetic orders are totally suppressed even at low temperature ; both the antiferromagnetic metal phase and the antiferromagnetic insulator phase disappears .",
    "when the interaction is increased , there is only a transition from a paramagnetic metal to a paramagnetic insulator .    finally , we present in fig .",
    "8 the distribution of the spectral weight at zero frequency , @xmath62 for different @xmath13 and @xmath31 with @xmath39 .",
    "the location of the maxima of @xmath63 can be seen as the fermi surface @xcite . as showed in fig .",
    "8 , when the interaction is small , the spectral function has sharp peaks at the center and along the two intersecting diagonals of the first brillouin zone , which is weakly renormalized compared to the non - interaction case , and exhibits a well - defined fermi surface . with the increasing of the interaction ,",
    "the peaks become lower , and finally vanish when the mott transition happens due to the localization of particles .",
    "the decreasing of the frustration also makes the fermi surface shrink .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction part , most of the theoretical and numerical studies of shastry - sutherland lattice are focusing on localized spins based on the heisenberg model @xcite , whose ground state phase diagram has two limiting behavior depending on the dimensionless parameter @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the exchange coupling constant along the nearest neighbour bonds and @xmath66 the one along the additional diagonal bonds . in the limit @xmath67 , the ground state is in antiferromagnet with gapless magnetic excitations . in the opposite limit @xmath68 ,",
    "the exact ground state is proved to be a valence bond solid where local spins form singlet dimers ( see fig .  6 ( a3 ) ) on the diagonal bonds .",
    "the transition point between these two phases at @xmath69 has been estimated to be @xmath70 @xcite .    in this report",
    ", we numerically investigate the hubbard model on the shastry - sutherland lattice which takes the itinerancy of electrons into account .",
    "when @xmath13 is large and overweights the effect of the kinetic energy , electrons get localized and the system reduces to the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model , which serves as a benchmark of our calculations . as shown in fig .  6 , at large @xmath13 limit , spins order antiferromagnetically when frustration ( @xmath71 ) is small . when frustration goes large , magnetic orders are suppressed and the system is a paramagnetic insulator .",
    "the critical point is around @xmath72 , which , at large @xmath13 limit , corresponds to @xmath73 for a heisenberg model .",
    "this is in good agreement with previous predictions , as mentioned in references [ 26]-[30 ] , where the system has a valence bond solid as its exact ground state beyond a critical @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , the paramagnetic insulator state that appears when @xmath57 should be a valence bond solid . in the intermediate coupling regime , the itinerancy of electrons must be taken into account and there is an antiferromagnetic metal phase between the paramagnetic metal phase and the antiferromagnetic insulator phase due to the competing of the frustration and the interaction .    in summary , by combining the cellular dynamical mean field approximation with the continuous time quantum monte carlo method",
    ", we investigate the hubbard model on shastry - sutherland lattice at half filling , and obtain phase diagrams with respect to interaction , frustration and temperature .",
    "our result shows that in the present of frustration an antiferromagnetic metal phase exists at low temperature between the paramagnetic metal phase and the antiferromagnetic insulator phase .",
    "when frustration goes beyond the critical value , magnetic orders are suppressed , and mott transition leads the system to a paramagnetic insulator , which should be a valence bond solid according to previous studies on heisenberg model on shastry - sutherland lattice .",
    "we hope our study can provide a new perspective for the property of this lattice .",
    "all calculations reported in this work are carried out by using the cellular dynamical mean field theory ( cdmft)@xcite and the continuous time quantum monte carlo method ( ctqmc)@xcite . in our work we map the original lattice onto a four - site effective cluster ( see fig .  1 ( b ) )",
    "embedded in a self - consistent medium . from an initialization of the self - energy @xmath75",
    ", the effective medium @xmath76 can be obtained via the coarse - grained dyson equation , @xmath77^{-1}+\\sigma(i\\omega),\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the chemical potential and @xmath25 is the fourier - transformed hopping matrix and @xmath24 is summed over the reduced brillouin zone .    after getting @xmath25 ,",
    "we can obtain the cluster green s function @xmath78 by simulating the effective cluster model using ctqmc as the impurity solver . using dyson function",
