    "black holes provide an important testing ground for string theory and other theories of quantum gravity . theories with extended supersymmetry allow for extremal bps black hole solutions , and for certain examples the microscopic and macroscopic entropy has been calculated with agreement to leading order @xcite , and even to higher orders when including @xmath1 corrections @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the entropy of certain near - extremal black holes can also be calculated @xcite , with at least leading order agreement . in order to improve on this analysis",
    "it is critical to have a systematic understanding of non - extremal black hole solutions of lower - dimensional supergravity theories .",
    "this naturally leads one to consider maps between the various special geometries of @xmath2 supergravity through dimensional reduction , which are also interesting mathematically .",
    "these go by the names of the r - map and c - map , and although they have been known for some time @xcite , they have also seen much recent interest , a small sample of which is given by @xcite .",
    "dimensional reduction over time need not be restricted to supersymmetric theories @xcite , with the standard reference for non - linear sigma models coupled to vector fields and gravity being the seminal paper @xcite . since static , single - centred black hole solutions",
    "correspond to geodesics in the target manifold of the image of these maps , there exists a rich interplay between physical objects and geometrical constructions .",
    "we will review the procedure presented in @xcite for producing non - extremal static black hole solutions to a large class of five - dimensional theories , which includes @xmath2 supergravity coupled to vector multiplets as a subclass .",
    "the method is based on @xcite , and uses dimensional reduction ( the r - map ) over a timelike direction followed by a specific field redefinition , which can be understood as follows : the physical scalar fields parametrise a hypersurface in a larger ambient space ( a @xmath3-conical affine special real manifold ) . the field redefinition combines the physical scalar fields with the kaluza - klein scalar , which can be used to parametrise the direction orthogonal to the hypersurface .",
    "the new scalar fields then parametrise the whole of the ambient space . after this procedure",
    "the effective lagrangian for static , spherically symmetric and purely electric backgrounds takes the particularly simple form : @xmath4 here @xmath5 are the scalars fields which combine the original five - dimensional physical scalars with the kaluza - klein scalar .",
    "the axionic scalar fields @xmath6 descend from the gauge sector , and represent the electric potentials .    solving the equations of motion",
    "corresponds to constructing harmonic maps from reduced spacetime into a target manifold , which becomes enlarged due to the dimensional reduction procedure .",
    "we focus on stu - like models , for which the general solution to the full second order equations of motion can be found .",
    "this is a class of models that contains the stu model along with specific generalisations that share the same feature of having a diagonal target space metric .",
    "we also consider models with block diagonal target space metrics , where a restricted class of solutions can be found that is based on the solutions to stu - like models .",
    "we will see that the number of independent scalar fields in these solutions depends on the number of blocks in the metric .",
    "for all models this provides one universal solution with constant scalar fields , because all metrics can be thought of as having at least one block ( the whole metric ) .",
    "we then investigate the criteria for solutions to correspond to static , non - extremal black holes in the five - dimensional theory with scalar fields that take finite values on the horizon .",
    "we find that the number of integration constants must reduce by half , which is suggestive of a first order rewriting .",
    "while first order equations governing examples of non - extremal black holes have been known for some time @xcite , it has previously been used ( to our knowledge ) only as an ansatz for obtaining specific non - extremal solutions .",
    "the logic presented here is different .",
    "we consider the most general type of solution and then restrict it to solutions that describe non - extremal black holes . for stu - like models all calculations",
    "are performed explicitly , and actually rather simply .    since this method",
    "does not rely critically on supersymmetry , we are able to consider a larger class of theories than @xmath7 supergravity coupled to vector multiplets .",
    "this is achieved by generalising the geometry of the target manifold of the scalar fields in two ways : firstly , we do not require that the hesse potential ( often called the prepotential ) is a homogeneous polynomial , but just a homogeneous function .",
    "secondly , we allow the degree of homogeneity not just to be three , but to be arbitrary .",
    "mathematically , this means that we replace the projective special real target manifold , which is required for @xmath7 supergravity @xcite , with a generalised projective special real manifold .",
    "the generalisation is captured in the degree of homogeneity of the hesse potential of the corresponding @xmath3-conical affine special real manifold @xcite .",
    "the kinetic terms of the gauge fields also get modified in an appropriate fashion .",
    "we refer to the dimensional reduction of such a theory as the generalised r - map .",
    "various geometrical aspects of this map have been discussed in @xcite , and the analogous generalisation of the rigid r - map has been also been considered in @xcite .",
    "let us first briefly review the five - dimensional reissner - nordstrm black hole , which will be our guiding example .",
    "this is a static , spherically symmetric and purely electric solution to a five - dimensional theory of gravity coupled to a single @xmath8 gauge field .",
    "the line element for this solution can be written as @xmath9 where the functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 are given by @xmath12 and are harmonic functions with respect to the flat metric on @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath14 the parameter @xmath15 is the electric charge , and @xmath16 is the non - extremality parameter .",
    "the mass is given by @xmath17 .",
    "in these coordinates the solution has an outer event horizon at @xmath18 and an inner cauchy horizon at @xmath19 .",
    "one can analytically continue these coordinates to the singularity , which is located at @xmath20 .",
    "the extremal limit in given by @xmath21 , in which case @xmath22 .",
    "it will be useful later to decompose the five - dimensional metric according to @xmath23 which for the reissner - nordstrm metric corresponds to @xmath24    the simple example of the reissner - nordstrm black hole gives us some important clues about non - extremal solutions :    a.   the solution is built from harmonic functions on @xmath13 .",
    "b.   the four - dimensional line element is flat in the extremal limit . c.   the non - extremal solution is obtained by dressing the extremal solution with one additional harmonic function @xmath11 .",
    "we will see that these key features of the reissner - nordstrm black hole are also true of more complicated non - extremal solutions .",
    "before we write down the lagrangian of the class of theories under consideration , we will first give a mathematical description of generalised projective special real geometry , which is a generalisation of the geometry of @xmath25 vector multiplets .",
    "this is based in part on @xcite , work in progress with vicente corts and the first author , and a summary given in @xcite .",
    "the less mathematically inclined reader may skip this section and move directly to section 2.2 .",
    "a @xmath3-conical affine special real manifold @xmath26 is a pseudo - riemannian manifold @xmath27 of @xmath28 equipped with a flat , torsion free ` special ' connection @xmath29 and vector field @xmath30 such that    a.   @xmath31 is completely symmetric .",
    "b.   @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the levi - civita connection . c.   @xmath34 .",
    "let us discuss each condition in turn .",
    "firstly one can define a natural set of special coordinates @xmath35 that are flat with respect to @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath36 with respect to these coordinates the condition ( i ) ensures that @xmath37 and , hence , the metric @xmath38 is given by the second derivatives of a function @xmath39 such a function is referred to a hesse potential , and it is not unique . for condition ( ii )",
    "we follow a similar analysis to @xcite , which deals with the particular case @xmath40 .",
    "this condition implies that @xmath30 is a homothetic killing vector field of weight @xmath3 @xmath41 moreover it ensures that the manifold has the property of being @xmath3-conical , which means there always exists a coordinate system @xmath42 , with @xmath43 , such that the metric decomposes as @xmath44 in these coordinates @xmath45 .",
    "one can then define the new coordinates @xmath46 , for which the homothetic killing vector @xmath30 becomes an euler vector field @xmath47 in such coordinates the metric components are homogeneous functions of degree @xmath48 @xmath49 which can be deduced from the fact that @xmath50 = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^i}$ ] .",
    "the last condition ( iii ) can be seen as a compatibility condition between the previous two conditions .",
    "it ensures that @xmath30 is the euler field associated with the special coordinates @xmath51 and , hence , the metric components are homogeneous functions of degree @xmath48 with respect to the special coordinates @xmath35 .",
    "it follows that one can always choose a unique hesse potential that is homogeneous of degree @xmath3 , which is given by @xmath52 in order to obtain physically relevant signatures we will require this hesse potential to be strictly positive .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a second metric on @xmath53 , given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "we can write this metric in a basis of special coordinates as @xmath56 where @xmath57 are the first and second derivatives of the hesse potential .",
    "if the metric @xmath38 has signature @xmath58 , which is the case for supergravity , then @xmath59 is strictly positive definite .",
    "the vector field @xmath30 acts as an isometry of the metric @xmath59 @xmath60    we define a generalised special real manifold @xmath61 as a hypersurface of constant @xmath62 in a @xmath3-conical affine special real manifold , with metric induced from @xmath59 . if @xmath63 then @xmath64 .",
    "it is particularly convenient to consider the hypersurface defined by @xmath65 @xmath66 and we denote the embedding of @xmath67 into @xmath53 given by the hypersurface @xmath65 by @xmath68 . for",

    "the metric can be written as @xmath72 a particularly natural set of coordinates is given by @xmath73 these are analogous to the inhomogeneous special coordinates @xmath74 on a projective special khler manifold .",
    "it is worth noting that one can also realise @xmath67 as the quotient manifold @xmath75 with quotient metric obtained from @xmath76 .",
    "for the special case that @xmath77 and the hesse potential is a polynomial then @xmath61 represents the target manifold of @xmath78 supergravity coupled to vector multiplets @xcite .",
    "the matrix @xmath79 restricted to the hypersurface @xmath65 provides the kinetic term for the gauge fields .",
    "we will make the same identifications when considering more general lagrangians , only we no longer require that @xmath77 or the hesse potential is a polynomial .",
    "we are now ready to generalise the lagrangian of five - dimensional @xmath2 supergravity coupled to @xmath80 abelian vector multiplets .",
    "our starting point is the lagrangian of a five - dimensional theory of gravity coupled to @xmath80 scalar fields and @xmath81 abelian gauge fields @xmath82 we could also have included a chern - simons term , however this will not be relevant for solutions which are static and purely electric . likewise for fermionic terms .",
    "spacetime indices run from @xmath83 , and target space indices from @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "the coupling matrices @xmath86 and @xmath79 depend only on @xmath71 .",
    "the scalar fields form a non - linear sigma model with values in an @xmath80-dimensional target manifold that we require to be generalised projective special real ( as defined in the previous section ) .",
    "the matrix @xmath79 are the components of the tensor field ( [ a ] ) on the corresponding @xmath3-conical affine special real manifold .",
    "we will require that @xmath87 has signature @xmath58 , and , hence , @xmath79 is positive definite .",
    "one obtains a projective special real manifold , and therefore @xmath0 supergravity , for the special case when @xmath77 and the hesse potential is a polynomial .",
    "we prefer not to work with the @xmath80 physical scalar fields @xmath71 but rather the @xmath81 special coordinates @xmath35 , which are subject to the hyper - surface constraint @xmath88 here @xmath62 is a smooth homogeneous function of degree @xmath3 , and represents the hesse potential of the corresponding @xmath3-conical affine special real manifold .",
    "it is often convenient to choose the parametrisation given by ( [ phiparam ] ) , where @xmath71 and @xmath35 can be related explicitly . in the lagrangian",
    "one must make the replacement @xmath89 and , hence , the lagrangian can be written as @xmath90 where it is understood that the scalar fields @xmath35 are now subject to the constraint ( [ hypconst ] ) .",

    "one can obtain a particularly simple effective lagrangian for static , spherically symmetric and purely electric solutions ( [ 4dlag ] ) . one key feature was that we worked always at the level of the ` larger ' moduli space : the @xmath3-conical affine special real manifold .",
    "we then focused on stu - like models , where we found the general solution to the equations of motion , and models that are block diagonal , where we found solution with as many independent scalar fields as there are blocks .",
    "since the metrics of all models contain at least one block , this also provides a universal solution to all models .",
    "we then investigated which solutions correspond to non - extremal black holes solutions of the five - dimensional theory . in order to obtain a finite horizon area and finite",
    "scalar fields the number of integration constants must halve , suggesting a first order rewriting of the equations of motion . for stu - like models",
    "all calculations were performed explicitly , and at every stage we can set @xmath21 to obtain the extremal solution . since we see no reason stu - like models should be privileged in their number of integration constants , we conjecture that all non - extremal black hole solutions should have half the number of integration constants one would expect from the second order equations of motion .",
    "one obvious extension to this work is to investigate solutions of more complicated models .",
    "however , it was shown in @xcite that the hyperbolic - sine form of the solution to stu - like models ( [ stusol ] ) does not give the most general solution for generic models .",
    "one must therefore replace the hyperbolic - sine function with something more complicated .",
    "it is an open question whether one can find a general formula for such a function , e.g. @xcite , or whether one can only find explicit formulas for specific models . at this point",
    "it is still not even clear in the literature that every extremal black hole solution admits a non - extremal generalisation @xcite .",
    "one may also wonder whether this analysis can be repeated for four - dimensional theories . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the effective action for static solutions to @xmath203 supergravity coupled to vector multiplets can be brought to the same simple form as ( [ 4dlag ] ) for general static spacetime metrics ( see p51 of @xcite ) .",
    "one can then follow exactly the same logic for axion - free solutions to the four - dimensional stu model as we have present here for the five - dimensional stu model : one can find the general solution to the equations of motion , and show that these correspond to black hole solutions with finite scalar fields only when the number of integration constants reduces by half .",
    "this will be presented in future work @xcite .",
    "another natural extension is to consider various other types of solutions .",
    "these include solutions with a cosmological constant or taub - nut charge , rotating solutions , domain walls , black strings and cosmological solutions .",
    "reduction over time has previously been used to construct black ring solutions @xcite , and in @xcite black ring solutions were constructed based on @xcite .",
    "cosmological solutions may also be particularly interesting as the non - extremal black hole solutions we have discussed can be continued beyond the horizon where the killing vector is spacelike .",
    "this provides a natural starting point for the construction of s - brane cosmological solutions @xcite .",
    "theories of gauged supergravity are also applicable to the analysis presented in this paper .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the same procedure can be used to find new non - extremal solutions to four - dimensional fayet - iliopoulos gauged supergravity .",
    "it would also be interesting to investigate non - extremal solutions of five - dimensional gauged supergravity , though solutions to the stu model have previously been found by other methods @xcite .",
    "lastly , one may wonder whether special khler geometry , which corresponds to @xmath203 supergravity coupled to vector multiplets , can be generalised in a way similar to the generalisation of special real geometry considered in this paper . at present there does not exist a well defined generalisation of special khler geometry .",
    "however , the dimensional reduction of @xmath3-conical affine special real geometry suggests that generalising the degree of homogeneity of the holomorphic prepotential may provide one consistent generalisation of conic affine special khler geometry",
    ". this would be interesting to investigate in the future .",
