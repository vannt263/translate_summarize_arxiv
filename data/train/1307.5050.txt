    "the periodically forced sir model @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 and variants of it , are extensively used to model seasonally recurrent diseases @xcite . here",
    "@xmath5 are the fractions of the population which are susceptible , infective , and recovered , @xmath6 denotes the birth and death rate , @xmath7 the recovery rate , and @xmath8 , which we assume is a positive continuous @xmath0-periodic function , is the seasonally - dependent transmission rate ( so that @xmath0 is the yearly period ) .    when simulating this model numerically ( see section [ numerical ] ) , it is observed that :    \\(i ) if @xmath9 , where @xmath10 @xmath11 then all solutions tend to the disease free equilibrium @xmath12",
    "this fact can be rigorously proved , see @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) if @xmath13 , then depending on the values of the parameters , one observes convergence to @xmath0-periodic orbits , or to @xmath14-periodic orbits with @xmath15 ( subharmonics ) , or chaotic behavior .",
    "a fundamental question , that is addressed here , is the _ existence _ of a @xmath0-periodic solution of the system .",
    "we demand , of course that the components @xmath16 of this solution will be positive .",
    "obviously when @xmath9 , a positive periodic solution can not exist , because such a solution would not converge to the disease - free equilibrium .",
    "we will prove , however , that    [ main ] whenever @xmath1 , there exists at least one @xmath0-periodic solution @xmath17 of ( [ s])-([r ] ) , all of whose components are positive .    thus , when @xmath0-periodic behavior is not observed in simulations , this is not due to the fact that such a solution does not exist , but rather to the fact that all @xmath0-period solutions are unstable .    despite the fact that the existence of a @xmath0-periodic solution of the @xmath0-periodically forced sir model is a fundamental issue , the only paper in the literature of which we are aware to have dealt with this question is the recent paper of jdar , villanueva and arenas @xcite .",
    "they treated a more general system then we do here ( including loss of immunity and allowing other coefficients besides @xmath8 to be @xmath0-periodic ) . restricting their existence result to the case of the sir model ( [ s])-([r ] )",
    ", they proved , using mawhin s continuation theorem , that a @xmath0-periodic solution exists whenever the condition @xmath18 holds .",
    "note that the condition ( [ jodar ] ) implies that @xmath19 , that is @xmath1 , but it is a stronger condition .",
    "theorem [ main ] uses only the condition @xmath1 , so that together with the fact noted above , that when @xmath9 a @xmath0-periodic solution does _ not _ exist , we have that @xmath1 is a _ necessary and sufficient _",
    "condition for the existence of a @xmath0-periodic solution with positive components .",
    "our technique for proving theorem [ main ] relies on nonlinear functional analysis , for which we refer to the textbooks @xcite . reformulating the problem as one of solving an equation in an infinite dimensional space of periodic functions ,",
    "we define a homotopy between the periodically forced problem and the autonomous problem in which @xmath8 is replaced by the mean @xmath20 .",
    "the autonomous problem has an endemic equilibrium , which is a trivial periodic solution .",
    "we then employ leray - schauder degree theory to continue this solution along the homotopy .",
    "the challenge here lies in the fact that there we always have a trivial periodic solution , given by the disease - free equilibrium , which lies on the boundary of the relevant domain @xmath21 in the functional space , which requires us to construct a smaller domain @xmath22 excluding the trivial solution , and to show that the conditions for applying the leray - schauder theory hold for the domain @xmath23 .",
    "we note that our proof of theorem [ main ] is easily extended to give the same result for the sirs model , which includes loss of immunity @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 we present the proof for the sir model ( @xmath27 ) in order to avoid notational clutter .    in section [ proof ]",
    "we prove theorem [ main ] . in section",
    "[ numerical ] we discuss how to obtain the @xmath0-periodic solution numerically , which can not be done by direct numerical simulation when it is unstable , and present some results obtained by using the galerkin method .",
    "finally , in section [ discussion ] we mention some other works providing rigorous mathematical results on forced sir models , beyond numerical simulation .",
    "since @xmath16 are fractions of the population we have @xmath28 for all @xmath29 - note that by adding the equations ( [ s])-([r ] ) we have @xmath30 .",
    "since @xmath31 does not appear in ( [ s]),([i ] ) , the equation ( [ r ] ) can be ignored , and it suffices to proved the existence of a periodic solution of ( [ s]),([i ] ) satisfying @xmath32 where the third condition is equivalent to @xmath33 .",
    "we decompose @xmath8 as @xmath34 setting , for @xmath35 $ ] , @xmath36 we consider the system @xmath37 @xmath38 which is homotopy between an unforced system with @xmath39 and our system ( [ s]),([i ] ) , which corresponds to @xmath40 . for @xmath41 , ( [ s1]),([i1 ] )",
    "has exactly two periodic solutions , which are constant , given by @xmath42 @xmath43 we note that @xmath44 ( the disease - free equilibrium ) is in fact a ( trivial ) periodic solution of ( [ s1])-([i1 ] ) for _ all _ @xmath45 . our aim is to continue the solution @xmath46 with respect to @xmath45 in order to prove the existence of a periodic solution for @xmath40 .",
    "to this end , we now reformulate the problem in a functional - analytic setting , which will enable us to employ degree theory .",
    "we rewrite ( [ s1]),([i1 ] ) as @xmath47 @xmath48    let @xmath49 be the banach spaces @xmath50 @xmath51    define the linear operator @xmath52 by @xmath53 and the nonlinear operator @xmath54 @xmath55 then the periodic problem for ( [ s2])-([i2 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath56 it is easy to check that @xmath57 is invertible , that is the equations @xmath58 and @xmath59 have unique @xmath60 @xmath0-periodic solutions @xmath61 for any @xmath62 , and the mapping @xmath63 given by @xmath64 is bounded .",
    "we can thus rewrite ( [ re ] ) as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is given by @xmath67 since @xmath63 is bounded , and since , by the arzela - ascoli theorem , @xmath68 is compactly embedded in @xmath69 , we can consider @xmath70 as a compact operator from @xmath69 to itself , and since @xmath54 is continuous , @xmath71 is compact as an operator from @xmath69 to itself .",
    "we therefore consider ( [ re1 ] ) in the space @xmath69 , and we note that any solution in @xmath69 will in fact be in @xmath68 , hence a classical solution of ( [ s2]),([i2 ] ) . since @xmath72 is a compact perturbation of the identity on @xmath69 , leray - schauder theory is applicable .",
    "since we want our solution to satisfy ( [ pos ] ) , we want to solve ( [ re1 ] ) in the subset @xmath73 given by @xmath74 note that for @xmath41 the solution @xmath46 given by ( [ i0 ] ) lies in @xmath21 .",
    "our aim is to continue this solution in @xmath45 up to @xmath40 .",
    "we recall that the leray - schauder degree theory ( see e.g. @xcite ) implies that , given a bounded open set @xmath75 , the existence of a solution @xmath76 of ( [ re1 ] ) for all @xmath35 $ ] will be assured if the following conditions hold :    \\(i ) @xmath77 ,    \\(ii ) @xmath78 ,    \\(iii ) @xmath79 for all @xmath80 , @xmath35 $ ] .    the most obvious choice for @xmath23 would be @xmath81 .",
    "however , this will not do , since @xmath44 ( given by ( [ i00 ] ) ) satisfies @xmath82 and @xmath83 , so that ( iii ) does not hold . to satisfy ( iii )",
    "we will need to choose @xmath23 so as to exclude @xmath44 from its boundary .",
    "we take @xmath23 to be the open subset of @xmath21 given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is fixed .",
    "note that @xmath86 .",
    "we will show below that @xmath23 satisfies ( i)-(iii ) if @xmath87 is chosen so that @xmath88 .",
    "we first show that @xmath44 is the _ only _ solution of ( [ re1 ] ) on @xmath89 .    [ only ] if @xmath90 is a solution of ( [ re1 ] ) for some @xmath35 $ ] , then @xmath91 , as given by ( [ i00 ] ) .",
    "assume that @xmath92 is a solution of ( [ s2]),([i2 ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath92 , if an only if @xmath93 and at least one of the following conditions holds :    \\(i ) there exists @xmath94 so that @xmath95 .",
    "\\(ii ) there exists @xmath94 so that @xmath96 .",
    "\\(iii ) there exists @xmath94 so that @xmath97 .",
    "we now consider each of these three cases :    \\(1 ) assume ( i ) holds .",
    "let @xmath98 be the solution of @xmath99 and let @xmath100 .",
    "then @xmath101 is a solution of the initial - value problem ( [ s2]),([i2 ] ) with initial condition @xmath102 by uniqueness of the solution for the initial - value problem , we conclude that @xmath103 , @xmath104 . thus @xmath105 satisfies @xmath106 , and since the only periodic solution of this equation is @xmath107 , we conclude that @xmath108 , as we wanted to prove .",
    "\\(2 ) assume now that ( ii ) holds .",
    "then from ( [ s2 ] ) we get @xmath109 . but",
    "this implies that @xmath110 for @xmath111 sufficiently close to @xmath112 , which contradicts ( [ cl ] ) .",
    "thus this case is impossible .",
    "\\(3 ) assume now that ( iii ) holds .",
    "moreover since we have already proven the result in the case that ( i ) holds , we may assume that @xmath113 for all @xmath29 . adding ( [ s1 ] ) and ( [ i1 ] ) we get @xmath114 therefore we conclude that @xmath115 for @xmath111 sufficiently close to @xmath112 , contradicting ( [ cl ] ) .",
    "therefore this case is impossible .",
    "we can now show that @xmath23 , defined by ( [ u ] ) , satisfies ( iii ) .",
    "assume @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath116 then , for any @xmath35 $ ] there are no solutions @xmath76 of ( [ re1 ] ) with @xmath117 .",
    "suppose @xmath117 .",
    "then either @xmath92 or @xmath118 and @xmath119 in the first case , lemma [ only ] and the fact that @xmath120 imply that @xmath76 is not a solution of ( [ re1 ] ) .",
    "we therefore assume that @xmath118 and ( [ bc ] ) holds , which implies that @xmath121 assume by way of contradiction that @xmath76 solves ( [ re1 ] ) , or equivalently @xmath76 solves ( [ s2]),([i2 ] ) . using the assumption @xmath118",
    ", we have that @xmath122 is everywhere positive , so we can divide ( [ i2 ] ) by @xmath122 , and integrate over @xmath123 $ ] , to obtain @xmath124 but from ( [ bc1 ] ) we get @xmath125 by the assumption @xmath126 we have @xmath127 , so that ( [ vv ] ) implies @xmath128 contradicting ( [ ee ] ) .    to apply the leray - schauder degree it remains to verify that ( i ) and ( ii ) hold .",
    "since @xmath129 , the condition @xmath130 implies @xmath77 , so ( i ) holds . to prove ( ii ) , it suffices to show that the frchet derivative @xmath131 is invertible .",
    "since @xmath132 is a compact perturbation of the identity so that @xmath131 is fredholm , it suffices to prove that the kernel of @xmath131 is trivial .",
    "indeed , let us assume that @xmath133 , and prove that @xmath134 .",
    "we have @xmath135 , or , equivalently , @xmath136 note that @xmath137 so that ( [ ker ] ) is equivalent to @xmath138 the characteristic polynomial of the above matrix is @xmath139 noting that @xmath140 and that , for @xmath141 , @xmath142 , we see that the matrix has no imaginary or @xmath143 eigenvalues , so that ( [ sys ] ) has no periodic solutions except @xmath144 , and the claim is proved .",
    "we have thus proven that ( i)-(iii ) hold , which completes the proof of theorem [ main ] .",
    "as we have noted in the introduction , the period solution whose existence was proved whenever @xmath1 is observable in numerical simulation of ( [ s])-([r ] ) only for those parameter regimes for which it is stable .",
    "therefore , if we are interested in examining the shape and amplitude of the @xmath0-periodic solution for values of the parameters for which the system displays subharmonic or chaotic behavior , we need a different computational approach .",
    "we now describe a simple approach that we successfully implemented , which allows us to observe the @xmath0-periodic solution for arbitrary parameters .",
    "we used the galerkin method , expanding the periodic solution @xmath145 in a fourier series .",
    "we used the maple system , whose symbolic capabilities make the implementation particularly easy .",
    "we take @xmath146 , @xmath147 and search for approximate periodic solutions of ( [ s]),([i ] ) the form @xmath148,\\nonumber\\\\ \\tilde{i}(t)&=&a_i^{0}+\\sum_{n=1}^n [ a_i^{n}\\cos(nt)+b_i^{n}\\sin(nt)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] plugging ( [ fo ] ) into ( [ s])-([i ] ) , and then taking the fourier coefficients of both sides of the equations with respect to @xmath149 we get @xmath150 algebraic equations in @xmath150 variables , which we numerically solve for @xmath151 , obtaining the approximate @xmath0-periodic solution ( [ fo ] ) .",
    "we have found that the numerical iteration for solving the algebraic equations , using maple s fsolve command , works well , when we start with the initial conditions for the iteration given by the endemic equilibrium of the autonomous case , that is @xmath152 ( see ( [ i0 ] ) ) and @xmath153 for @xmath154 .",
    "we check that the functions @xmath155 indeed approximate a periodic solution of ( [ s]),([i ] ) by observing that the highest fourier coefficients @xmath156 are very small , and by plugging @xmath155 into ( [ s]),([i ] ) and checking that the residual is small .",
    "we note that theoretical justification of the galerkin method for approximating periodic solutions can be found , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "we now present some examples of results obtained by the method described above . with the period @xmath157 of the forcing representing one year ,",
    "we took take @xmath7 corresponding to a @xmath158-week infectious period , @xmath159 , @xmath6 corresponding to @xmath160 population growth rate per year , giving @xmath161 .",
    "these parameters are approximately those estimated for measles .",
    "we consider different values of the strength of seasonality @xmath45 ( see ( [ for ] ) ) . in figure 1",

    "numerical simulations show that complex dynamics - subharmonic and chaotic behavior - is very common in the forced sir model .",
    "it is interesting to ask to what extent the complex dynamics of the forced sir model can be rigorously understood , beyond numerical simulations . while we do not expect to be able to precisely characterize the dynamics of the model for different parameter values , it is of great interest even to be able to rigourously prove that complicated dynamics occurs for at least _ some _ parameter values . in this context",
