    "there have been a number of reports ( @xcite ) of small anisotropies in the ultra high energy cosmic ray arrival direction distribution with respect to the galactic or supergalactic plane .",
    "recently , a high statistics search for anisotropy has been reported by the akeno / agasa collaboration ( @xcite ) .",
    "this group reports a small anisotropy towards the galactic plane at energies near @xmath6 .",
    "the statistical significance of this evidence is not strong , however , and the various ground array experiments have reported systematic errors due to temperature and pressure variations and detector energy scale estimation which are quite different from the systematic errors in fly s eye type of experiments .",
    "it is therefore important , both from the point of view of statistics and systematics , to have as complete a picture as possible of all the evidence on anisotropy .",
    "this paper is the final result on cosmic ray anisotropy from the original fly s eye experiment ( @xcite ) which ran from 1981 to 1992 .",
    "previous publications ( @xcite ) were based on subsets of this complete data sample .",
    "observation of cosmic ray anisotropy , when taken together with studies of the cosmic ray spectral shape and cosmic ray composition can yield very important clues to the nature of the highest energy cosmic rays .",
    "if cosmic rays come from the galactic plane and are largely protonic in composition , we expect to see a galactic plane enhancement which becomes more significant with energy , since the proton rigidity will increase .",
    "a heavy composition dominated by iron nuclei will tend to show much smaller anisotropy at any given energy because of the smaller larmor radius of the heavy nuclei .",
    "previously reported fly s eye data on spectrum ( @xcite ) and composition ( @xcite ) support a two component model where a mostly heavy galactic composition is superceded by a mostly light , extragalactic component .",
    "the cross - over between these two cosmic ray fluxes appears to be near @xmath7 .",
    "if correct , this model would imply at best a small galactic plane enhancement below @xmath8 .",
    "if the higher energy cosmic ray flux is indeed mostly extragalactic , it may have a different anisotropy from the lower energy component .",
    "strong nearby extragalactic sources could lead to strong anisotropies at energies near @xmath9 . if extragalactic magnetic fields are not greater than a nanogauss ( @xcite ) , charged particle astronomy becomes possible at these energies .",
    "it has been recently suggested that extragalactic sources may be distributed along the supergalactic plane ( @xcite ) .",
    "if so , we might expect an enhancement of cosmic ray arrival directions towards this plane at high enough energies . of course , extragalactic sources might have a more complex distribution .",
    "they may even reflect the pattern of filaments and voids that are seen in deep space galactic surveys ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , if the origin of the highest energy cosmic rays is due to decay of topological defects ( @xcite ) , then the anisotropy may have no relation to the distribution of visible matter in the universe .",
    "the fly s eye experiment consisted of two detectors ( f.e . i and f.e .",
    "ii ) located at dugway proving ground ( @xmath10 north ) in utah .",
    "the two detectors were spaced 3.4 km apart .",
    "details of the experimental technique can be found in ( @xcite ) .",
    "briefly , uhe cosmic rays entering the atmosphere form an extensive air shower ( eas ) .",
    "the ionizing particles in this shower excite nitrogen fluorescence in the atmosphere .",
    "isotropically emitted light from this fluorescence is collected by spherical mirrors and detected by photomultipliers located at the two detector sites .",
    "the photomultiplier tube signals can be used to determine the geometry of the eas ( i.e. its distance from the detector and arrival direction ) and the energy of the primary particle .",
    "i had a larger aperture than f.e .",
    "ii and events seen by it fall into the monocular data set .",
    "events seen simultaneously by f.e.ii ( which had a more limited aperture ) were classified as stereo events .",
    "about 1/3 of the monocular data set was also seen in stereo . because events seen in stereo have redundant measurements , the typical stereo geometrical and energy resolution is significantly better than that which is purely monocular . in order to have acceptable resolution ,",
    "monocular data must be subjected to a number of cuts .",
    "the present data sample is large enought so that there is still statistical power even after the relatively stringent cuts required .",
    "all the fly s eye data used in this analysis must pass a minimum standard cut which cuts out events with variables outside their natural range , or that have error greater than one half of their range or have relative error greater than 10.0 ( @xcite ) .    in this study",
    ", we try to minimize the angular resolution while keeping the number of events as large as possible .",
    "we are guided by a monte - carlo simulation using a two source model of proton showers and iron showers .",
    "this model gives results consistent with the fly s eye spectrum and composition results previously reported ( @xcite ) .",
    "these simulated events then pass the same event reconstruction programs as the real data . the reconstructed value and the input value for different variables",
    "are then compared .",
    "the angular error is defined as the space angle between the input shower direction and the reconstructed one .",
    "the tighter the data cut used , the fewer events remain .",
    "the optimization is to maximize the ratio of the relative decrease of angular error and the relative decrease of the number of events .",
    "the most important factor controlling the angular error of monocular events is the shower track length .",
    "an event with longer track length has more degrees of freedom to determine arrival direction and , therefore , it has less angular error .",
    "we find the optimal track length is @xmath11 .",
    "the data are separated into six energy intervals e1 : @xmath12 , e2 : @xmath13 , e3 : @xmath14 , e4 : @xmath15 , e5 : @xmath16 , and e6 : @xmath17 . according to the two source model",
    ", e1 should correspond to an almost pure iron composition while e5 and e6 consist of almost pure protons .",
    "the width of each energy interval is about half a decade , so we choose the relative energy error @xmath18",
    ".    a bracket of depth at shower maximum , @xmath19 , is also applied @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the energy in @xmath22 .",
    "events outside this bracket have poorly reconstructed shower profile and large angular errors .",
    "the relative error of @xmath19 is set at 1.0 .",
    "we also apply a zenith angle cut at @xmath23 .",
    "the fly s eye detectors operate on moonless nights . a weather code ( @xcite )",
    "was recorded for every hour of observation .",
    "we required data to have been taken when less than 1/4 of the sky is cloudy .",
    "since we do nt know the actual arrival direction of real events , we can not define the angular error as in monte - carlo simulated data .",
    "we use the uncertainty of the reconstructed value , i.e. the uncertainty in zenith angle @xmath24 and error in azimuth angle @xmath25 .",
    "an overall angular uncertainty is defined as @xmath26 this value also shows a strong dependence on track length .",
    "statistically , the mean angular uncertainty is related to the angular error ( @xcite ) .",
    "but it is impossible to predict angular error from angular uncertainty on an event by event basis .",
    "a cut at @xmath27 on angular uncertainty is applied to the data .",
    "the tight cuts we used in this study are listed in table 1 .",
    "the resulting number of events of mono and stereo data are listed in table 2 . because the stereo data have only two events at energy @xmath28 , this analysis does not apply to this energy bin .    from monte - carlo studies ,",
    "the angular resolution is @xmath29 for monocular data and is @xmath30 for stereo data at the 50% confidence level . at the 90% confidence level ,",
    "the angular resolution is @xmath31 for monocular data and is @xmath29 for stereo data .    for the stereo subsample",
    ", we can compare the same event reconstructed by monocular and stereo methods .",
    "the space angle between these two direction is also a measure of the possible angular resolution of this subset of data .",
    "figure 1 shows the resulting poisson like distribution of angular resolution . at 50% confidence level ,",
    "the angular resolution is approximately @xmath32 . in the large scale anisotropy analysis , in order to have enough statistics in each bin , we choose a bin width of 10 degrees for both monocular and stereo data .",
    "the background expected from an isotropic intensity can , in principle , be calculated by @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the predicted isotropic background at longitude @xmath35 and latitude @xmath36 at energy @xmath21 and @xmath37 is the event rate at time @xmath38 .",
    "note that @xmath39 and @xmath40 are here regarded as functions of @xmath41 and @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath42 is the acceptance of the detector , the geometric efficiency which is the relative ability to detect events of energy @xmath21 from a certain zenith angle @xmath39 and azimuth angle @xmath40 .",
    "although the fly s eye pmt singles rate is kept constant , the real event rate fluctuates due to variations in night sky noise and weather condition . instead of using this integration",
    ", we use a scrambled event method to determine the isotropic background with better accuracy .    from the real data , we select the events that pass the weather code cut and store their trigger time in a time data bank . for those events that pass the tight cuts , we store their arrival direction @xmath43 in a direction data bank . the time data bank contains information on the system on / off time and trigger rate @xmath37 .",
    "the direction data bank contains the acceptance information .",
    "then a simulated event is generated by randomly sampling a set of @xmath44 from direction data bank and an event trigger time from time data bank .",
    "this randomization destroys the correlation from any source .",
    "the simulated events thus represent an expected data set if cosmic rays are isotropic .    because of changes to the fly s eye hardware ,",
    "the acceptance may be different for different operation epochs .",
    "the background is calculated using the time and direction data from the same epoch . however , at energy @xmath45 , the number of events is so small that the acceptance becomes indistinguishable between epochs . in order to have proper statistics",
    ", we have to combine all epochs to form a direction data bank for this energy range .    in this study",
    ", we simulate 5,000 sets of data each having the same number of events as real data .",
    "the mean value of those 5,000 sets is used as the expected detector exposure .",
    "the fluctuation of those 5,000 sets represents the unceratinty in the exposure .",
    "we compare the arrival direction distributions for two zones of the sky .",
    "the first zone is the whole sky while the second zone is the half of the sky ( @xmath46 where the fly s eye acceptance covers most of the galactic latitude .",
    "we also compare the distribution in supergalactic coordinates .",
    "the null hypothesis of this study is that cosmic rays are isotropically distributed .",
    "based on this hypothesis , we simulate the expected sky distribution and then compare it with the real data distribution .",
    "the data and background are binned in @xmath47 latitude bins and the @xmath48 of data vs background are calculated .",
    "we define +    [ cols=\"<,^ , < \" , ]     the number of degrees of freedom equals n-1 for the full sky zone and the supergalactic zone . for the half sky zone , we need to take out one more degree of freedom to normalize the total number of events .",
    "the probability of the f - test @xmath49 is then calculated .",
    "a small probability suggests the functional form is necessary .",
    "the error of the fit parameter @xmath50 is calculated by a similar process . the upper and lower bounds on @xmath50 are the values of @xmath50 at @xmath51 .",
    "the error @xmath52 is then calculated as one half of the difference of the upper and lower bound .",
    "the same procedures are applied to the 5,000 simulated data sets .",
    "the result of theses fits provides a check on the systematic error of the fit procedure .",
    "the significance of the fit to the data ( @xmath53 ) should be compared to the mean fitted value ( @xmath54 ) and standard deviation ( @xmath55 ) of fitted value of all simulated data sets .",
    "then @xmath56 is defined as @xmath57 a single side gaussian probability of this @xmath56 is also calculated @xmath58 to compare the data with the simulated data sets , a probability of having a greater fitted value is calculated by @xmath59 the total number of simulated data sets is 5,000 .",
    "figure 3 shows the histogram of the wwfe fit parameter @xmath60 for the simulated isotropic data sets .",
    "the distribution of fit parameters can be fitted to a gaussian form .",
    "this figure shows the statistical fluctuation of an isotropic background .",
    "the fit parameter for the real data , @xmath53 , is shown by the solid arrow .",
    "a small value of probability(@xmath61 ) suggests the fit parameter is large compared to the fluctuation of isotropic background .",
    "a large value ( @xmath62 ) suggests that the fit parameter is small .",
    "tables 4 thru 7 list the fit results in galactic coordinates .",
    "tables 8 and 9 list the fit results in supergalactic coordinates .",
    "figure 4 thru 9 show the fit results for various conditions .",
    "due to the limited coverage of galactic latitude , the isotropic background does not always produce a null plane enhancement factor or gradient .",
    "however , the systematic bias is negligible at energies @xmath63 . the systematic bias is higher at energy @xmath64 and the fit parameter may not be the true magnitude of the anisotropy .",
    "however , the significance and probability are not affected by this bias , because the data is compared with simulated data sets .",
    "the probabilities quoted in the latter part of this article all come from @xmath65 .",
    "we also make a study of the systematic bias by reducing the number of events in each energy bin and redoing the fitting .",
    "figure 10 shows the distribution of fit parameters and background as a function of total number of events .",
    "this study shows that the fit result does not depend strongly of event number .",
    "however when the number of event falls below 100 , the isotropic background begins to give @xmath60 significantly different from 0 .",
    "this shows the systematic bias is an effect of low statistics .",
    "we suspect the large negative @xmath60 reported in some studies ( @xcite ) could also be affected by the large bias due to low statistics .",
    "the other systematic effect is that the error is not poisson distributed .",
    "if we use the square root of the expected number @xmath66 as the error , we will over - estimate the error in higher event count regions , galactic latitude @xmath67 to @xmath68 . by using the fitted error",
    ", we improve both the @xmath48 value and the accuracy of the fit .      to search for anisotropy , we first look at the @xmath48 between data and isotropic background .",
    "the @xmath69 in table 10 shows that e2 has @xmath69 less than 0.20 for all data .",
    "this may indicate that the data distribution is inconsistent with an isotropic background .",
    "on the other hand , for e4 , all the @xmath69 are larger than 0.5 , this might suggest the cosmic ray distribution at e4 is consistent with an isotropic background .",
    "the most significant result is the wwfe fit for e2 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the significance varies from 0.031 to 0.002 .",
    "both mono and stereo data give the fit plane enhancement factor @xmath60 at about 0.10 .",
    "the f - test probabilities , 0.012 for mono and 0.108 for stereo , also show that such a wwfe fit indeed reduces the @xmath48 .",
    "a non - zero @xmath60 is needed to fit the data . finally , the isotropic background has a chance probability @xmath70 for mono data and 0.016 for stereo data to produced @xmath60 larger than the @xmath60 of the data .",
    "the gradient fit produces @xmath71 to @xmath72 or @xmath73 , which is not sufficiently significant .",
    "the data thus supports a small anisotropy in e2 ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "figure 11 shows the number of events , event rate , and significance in the e2 bin .",
    "table 10 lists the probability values of all the fits .",
    "the table shows that most of the fits have similar probability for full sky and half sky zones except the wwfe fit to stereo data at e3 .",
    "similar result can be found for mono and stereo data except for the e1 gradient fit and the e4 wwfe fit .",
    "based on previous fe results on spectrum and composition , we expect that the anisotropy in the energy range below 3.0 eev may be different from that of the higher energy flux .",
    "the lower energy data appears to be of a heavier composition and is likely to be of a galactic origin .",
    "we can separate data into two groups : group 1 , e1-e3 energy @xmath75 and group 2 , e4-e6 energy @xmath76 .",
    "we use compound probability ( @xcite ) to combine probabilities in table 10 .",
    "the results are listed in table 11 .",
    "@xmath77    table 11 show that group 1 supports a positive @xmath60 at approximately @xmath78 for monocular data and @xmath79 for stereo data .",
    "this result suggests that cosmic rays with energy@xmath63 may have a small anisotropy related to the galactic plane .",
    "the stereo data has a less significant anisotropy because of a very small @xmath60 and large probability at e1 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "detailed comparison between mono data and stereo data shows that there is in fact an excess of events near the galactic center in the mono data . however , the stereo data acceptance is small in this region due to smaller zenith angle coverage . for the galactic latitude gradient ,",
    "the compound probabilities are in disagreement between monocular data and stereo data .    for group 2 ,",
    "both mono and stereo data have no signs of galactic plane enhancements .",
    "the gradient fit shows nothing significant again .",
    "cosmic rays with energy@xmath64 are consistant with an isotropic background . due to the low statistics and large background bias for energy@xmath80",
    ", we can not prove any anisotropy in this energy region .",
    "table 12 lists the probability @xmath65 of mono and stereo data in supergalactic coordinates .",
    "although the e2 @xmath60 fit has a @xmath81 , ( approximately @xmath82 ) , the event distribution shows that the excess of events comes from supergalactic latitude @xmath83 or @xmath84 , i.e. regions where an excess from the galactic plane could be having a strong effect .",
    "this supergalactic polar excess is not significant either in indiviual bin ( e2 mono data @xmath85 ) or over three energy bins ( e1-e3 ) .",
    "contrary to the stanev et al .",
    "( @xcite ) result , we do not see evidence of anisotropy coming from the supergalactic plane for energies @xmath80 .",
    "however , this result is consistent with kewley et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "they did not find excess of supergalactic plane in the southern sky either .",
    "most ground array experiment use harmonic analysis to look for anisotropy .",
    "however , the fly s eye does not have uniform coverage in right ascension and this makes harmonic analysis difficult to interpret .",
    "there had been several reports on the anisotropy toward the galactic plane .",
    "gillerman & watson ( @xcite ) combined several groups data on @xmath60 and calculate the @xmath48 for a null fit ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "they report a @xmath87 or a probability of 0.9% that @xmath60 is consistent with zero . there may be problems with possible different energy scales between these groups of data . in this study",
    ", we use the same data set , therefore there is no problem with energy cross - calibration .",
    "the overall result still supports an enhancement from the galactic plane .",
    "recently , the agasa group reported a significant first harmonic at energy @xmath88 , with a chance probability of 0.005% ( @xcite ) . considering the possible energy scale difference between the fly s eye and the agasa",
    ", this range may well overlap with our range @xmath89 .",
    "a detailed comparison of the two groups results is currently under study .",
    "1 .   we reexamine both the monocular and stereo fly s eye data and look for anisotropy related to galactic or supergalactic latitude .",
    "two functional forms are studied .",
    "the first is the latitude gradient @xmath90 the second is plane enhancement factor @xmath91 2 .",
    "the isotropic background is calculated by scrambling the event arrival direction and trigger time .",
    "there are 5,000 simulated data sets , each having the same number of events as the real data .",
    "the mean value of these 5,000 sets are used to represent the distribution expected from isotropy .",
    "the standard deviation of these 5,000 sets is used as the uncertainty in that distribution .",
    "we find that the galactic plane enhancement factor @xmath60 is non - zero at the @xmath92 level for energies @xmath75 .",
    "the chance probability of such an anisotropy existing in these 3 energy bins is less than 0.06% . for energy @xmath76 , although a negative plane enhancement factor could be possible , the significance is less than @xmath93 .",
    "the galactic latitude gradient is only significant in the energy range @xmath94 where the galactic plane enhancement is strongest too .",
    "overall , the galactic latitude gradient is not as significant as the galactic plane enhancement factor .",
    "one should bear in mind that the actual form of the anisotropy may be different from either the wwfe or grad functions .",
    "no significant supergalactic latitude gradient or supergalactic plane enhancement factor is found .",
    "this analysis supports the the view that the arrival directions of cosmic rays at energies @xmath75 are weakly correlated with the galactic plane . for energy @xmath64 , no significant anisotropy is found .",
