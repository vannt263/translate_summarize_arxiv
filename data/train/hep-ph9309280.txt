    "hadron production in @xmath5 annihilation originates from the production of quark - antiquark pairs , which can radiate gluons , the quanta of the field theory of the strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "gluon radiation depends logarithmically on the centre of mass energy due to the increasing phase space with increasing energy and the energy dependence of the running coupling constant of qcd .",
    "these effects lead to variations of the momentum spectra of the produced hadrons as a function of the centre of mass energy , even if the momenta are scaled to that energy .",
    "these scaling violations can be used to determine the strong coupling constant _ s @xmath6 .",

    "nucleon scattering leads to @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this is somewhat lower than , but not in disagreement with , @xmath8 measurements at the @xmath0 mass from shape variables , jet rates and total cross sections as measured at the electron - positron storage ring lep@xcite .    until now _",
    "s @xmath6  has not been determined from scaling violations in @xmath9 annihilation , since this requires precise data at two very different energies to observe a significant scaling violation .",
    "data collected at the pep and petra storage rings were only precise at energies around @xmath10 gev@xcite and the scaling violation was only observed qualitatively@xcite .    in this paper",

    "s @xmath6  determination from the scaling violations in the fragmentation function by combining the data at lep with data from the pep , petra and tristan storage rings .",
    "the squared four - momentum transfer from the incoming leptons to outgoing hadrons studied here is two orders of magnitude larger than the ones studied in deep inelastic scattering , thus avoiding regions where non - perturbative effects noticeably influence the results . on the other hand , in @xmath9",
    "annihilation one has to combine data from different experiments at different energies and study the effect of the varying quark flavour composition due to the @xmath0-resonance .",
    "as will be shown , these are not dominant uncertainties ( see also ref .",
    "the inclusive production of charged hadrons in the reaction @xmath11 can be described by two kinematic variables , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath12 is defined as the square of the four - momentum transferred from the leptons to the hadrons and @xmath13 is the fraction of the beam energy @xmath14 carried by the hadron @xmath15 . in @xmath9 annihilation @xmath12",
    "equals @xmath16 , the total centre of mass energy squared .",
    "the fragmentation function @xmath17 is directly related to the scaled hadron momentum distribution : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the total cross section and @xmath17 is the sum of fragmentation functions @xmath20 over all five flavours , each having a weight @xmath21 given by the electroweak theory .",
    "the delphi data were collected during 1991 at energies near the z^0 @xmath22  peak .",
    "multi - hadronic events were selected according to the criteria given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the selection required that there were at least 5 charged particles with momenta above 0.2 gev / c and a track length in the detector of at least 50 cm , that the total energy of the charged particles exceeded 15 gev ( pion mass assumed ) , that the forward and backward hemisphere with respect to the beam axis each contained a total energy of charged particles larger than 3 gev , and that the polar angle of the sphericity axis was between @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "in addition the momentum imbalance was restricted by requiring that the absolute sum of the three - momenta of charged particles was less than 20 gev / c .    after these selection criteria , 186774 events at a mean centre of mass energy of 91.2 gev were kept .",
    "the background due to beam - gas scattering and @xmath25-interactions was less than 0.1% and @xmath26 events contributed 0.2% to the selected sample .",
    "the scaled inclusive momentum spectrum was obtained by correcting the @xmath13 distribution of all charged particles for initial state radiation , particle decays , detector effects , and selection cuts . in principle",
    "@xmath13 is the fraction of the beam energy @xmath14 carried by the hadron @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath27 , but instead of @xmath28 the momentum @xmath29 was used .",
    "this was experimentally better measured and provided the same scaling violation information .",
    "the corrections were obtained from a detailed monte carlo simulation of the detector after generating the hadronic z^0 @xmath22  decays with the monte carlo program from the lund group@xcite .",
    "higher order initial state bremsstrahlung radiation was implemented by using the dymu3 program@xcite .",
    "the corrected data were obtained by multiplying the data in each bin of a histogram by a correction factor defined as @xmath30 where @xmath31 are the contents of the histogram bin @xmath32 at the generator level witout initial state radiation , and @xmath33 after initial state radiation and detector simulation . all primary particles with a lifetime larger than @xmath34 s were assumed to be stable at the generator level , i.e. they were included in @xmath31 , and all those with a shorter mean life ( including @xmath35 s and @xmath36 s ) were allowed to decay as part of the simulation process .",
    "thus the corrected distributions include the contributions of these short - lived particles , as was the practice in experiments at lower energies .",
    "each histogram was normalized to the total number of events .",
    "the corrected distribution is simply : @xmath37 the corrections varied smoothly and were less than 35% for @xmath13 below 0.8 ( see fig . [",
    "only this range was used for the comparison with qcd in the next section .",
    "the correction factors deviated from one due to acceptance losses and momentum measurement errors . for larger @xmath13 values the momentum measurement errors dominated and , together with the steeply falling spectrum , caused a smearing towards higher momenta , resulting in a correction factor of 0.4 near @xmath13=1 . the corrected spectrum and thus the fragmentation function was obtained from the total number of events @xmath38 and the corrected event numbers @xmath39 for each @xmath13 value : @xmath40 the corrected spectrum is displayed in fig .",
    "[ f1]b and tabulated in table [ t1 ] together with the statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "the systematic uncertainties were determined by varying the selection criteria and by using different monte carlo simulations .",
    "the largest uncertainty in the correction factor is connected with the uncertainty in the charged multiplicity : the integral of the @xmath13 distribution is equal to the total charged multiplicity , since each event has @xmath41 entries , so a systematic error in the multiplicity after detector simulation translates into an uncertainty on the normalisation of the @xmath13 distribution .",
    "varying the cuts , especially changing the minimum number of charged particles from 5 to 6 and varying the cut on the sphericity axis between @xmath42 and @xmath43 , changed the correction factors by less than 10% of their deviation from 1 , i.e. typically 3% in the intermediate range , but up to 10% for @xmath13 above 0.8 and @xmath13 below 0.04 .    in the lund monte carlo program several generators can be used .",
    "partons can be generated either with the `` parton shower '' algorithm or by using the exact @xmath44 qcd matrix element .",
    "the difference in correction factor between these two options was less than 1% in the intermediate @xmath13 range .",
    "more details can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the relative systematic uncertainty from the sources mentioned above was parametrised in the following way : @xmath45 this procedure gives a relative error of at least 3% for the intermediate @xmath13 range and increases the error near the endpoints .",
    "it should be noted that the systematic uncertainties are correlated between the bins , since a change in the selection criteria moved the correction factors for each bin all in the same direction .",
    "these correlations will be taken into account in the determination of the strong coupling constant .",
    "a significant scaling violation is observed between the delphi spectrum at 91 gev and the data from tasso@xcite at a lower centre of mass energy ( see fig . [ f1]b ) .",
    "note that the errors are smaller than the symbols for most of the data points on this logarithmic plot . in order to show the scaling violation and the errors more clearly , the ratio of the curves in fig .",
    "[ f1]b is shown in fig .",
    "as can be seen , the scaling violation varies from + 40 % to -30% for @xmath13 varying between 0.01 and 0.7 .",
    "the deviation of the data from the horizontal line in each @xmath13 bin is , to first order , proportional to the strong coupling constant , so each data point yields an independent measurement of _ s @xmath6 .",
    "all values should be consistent , which is a strong constraint and simultaneously a cross check .    in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] the delphi data are compared with other experiments at lower energies@xcite for several @xmath13 intervals . clearly , at small @xmath13 values the fragmentation function increases about 30% , while at high @xmath13 values it decreases by roughly the same amount .",
    "this is exactly what is expected : the higher the energy , the more phase space becomes available for gluon radiation .",
    "since the primary quarks lose more energy due to radiation , this depopulates the high @xmath13 region .",
    "the radiated gluons tend to populate the small @xmath13 region , increasing the spectrum there .",
    "the curves are the qcd fits for high @xmath12 and large @xmath13 , as will be described in the next chapter .",
    "clearly all @xmath13 ranges agree well with the qcd fits , even if they are extrapolated to small @xmath13 and small @xmath12 .",
    "the fact that all regions can be described by a single value of the qcd scale @xmath46 provides the cross check mentioned above .",
    "the scaling violations in the fragmentation function , defined by eq . [ e1 ] , are described by the coupled integro  differential evolution equations@xcite , which can be written as : @xmath47 the splitting functions @xmath48 in the 2x2 matrix are the probabilities of finding parton @xmath32 with momentum fraction @xmath49 from its parent parton @xmath50 where @xmath51 refers to a gluon and @xmath52 to a quark .",

    ", one has to integrate @xmath48 convoluted with the probability @xmath56 that the parton with energy fraction @xmath49 fragments into a hadron with momentum fraction @xmath13 .",
    "the symbol @xmath57 denotes a convolution integral : @xmath58 note that @xmath59 is the fractional hadron energy , i.e. @xmath60 , since @xmath61 and @xmath62 obviously , @xmath49 has to be larger than @xmath13 , hence the lower bound in the integral .",
    "the evolution equations describe the @xmath12 dependence of the fragmentation function .",
    "their solutions have not yet been found in an analytical form .",
    "numerical solutions , which account for second order corrections to the splitting functions or to the anomalous dimensions have been developed in ref .",
    "alternatively , one can integrate the exact second order qcd matrix element directly , which has some advantages , as will be discussed later .    in principle",
    "the fragmentation of quarks involves an infinite number of soft and collinear gluons .",
    "hence , a cut - off on the isolation of the gluons is used in order to decide whether a gluon should be part of the quark fragmentation or if it should fragment independently . in the latter case it contributes to @xmath63 instead of @xmath64 .    as a cut - off",
    ", the minimum invariant mass between quarks and gluons was required to be above 9.1 gev / c@xmath65 .",
    "this cut presents an arbitrary definition of quarks and gluons , but it has to be made in any analysis of the scaling violations . it was varied in order to study its effect on the determination of ^(5 ) _",
    "@xmath66 , as will be discussed in the section on systematc errors .",
    "such an invariant mass cut selects a certain part of phase space , which varies with energy , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f3a ] . here",
    "the energy fractions @xmath67 of both quarks in second order qcd were plotted against each other at centre of mass energies of 35 and 91 gev .",
    "the 2-jet events are located at @xmath68 and the 3- and 4-jet events more towards the centre .",
    "one clearly observes the strong increase in phase space for the events away from the 2-jet region .",
    "the invariant mass cut @xmath69where @xmath70 are the invariant masses between any pair of partons and @xmath71 are the fractional quark energies , eliminates the soft and collinear gluons in the regions @xmath72 for the centre of masss energies of 35 ( 91 ) gev .",
    "the difference in phase space between these energies increases the @xmath73 cross section with a given ` hardness ' of the gluon , i.e. with a given invariant mass cut , by a factor four : the 3-jet rate varies from 20% to 80% , as shown ( for a constant value of @xmath8 of 0.121 ) by the solid line in fig . [ f3b ] .",
    "in addition to the @xmath12 dependence of the phase space , one has to consider the @xmath12 dependence of @xmath8 , which has the opposite effect : it decreases the @xmath73 rate with increasing energy .",
    "this decrease , from the running of the coupling constant , can be observed if the phase space for the @xmath73 final state is defined as a constant fraction of the total phase space , for example by a constant @xmath74-cut instead of a constant invariant mass cut . in this case",
    "the only @xmath12 dependence comes from the running of the coupling constant , which decreases the @xmath73 cross section by about 20% if the centre of mass energy is increased from 35 to 91 gev@xcite .",
    "this decrease of the 3-jet rate in a constant fraction of phase space is shown ( for a fixed value of @xmath46 of 270 mev and renormalisation scale @xmath75 ) as the dashed line in fig .",
    "note that the scaling violation from the running of _ s @xmath6is a small effect compared with the scaling violation from the change in phase space , as is apparent from fig .",
    "[ f3b ] .",
    "the large phase space dependence can be absorbed in the fragmentation function , which then depends on both @xmath13 _ and _ @xmath12 .",
    "the redefined cross section has a well determined perturbative expansion in @xmath76",
    ". this would not be the case if the large phase space corrections , proportional to @xmath77 , were considered to be qcd corrections .",

    "the extraction of _ s @xmath6  from the observed scaling violations is straightforward .",
    "first , the @xmath13 dependence of the fragmentation function , which can not be calculated perturbatively , must be parametrised from data at a reference energy . starting from this parametrisation at the reference energy , the evolution to higher energies",
    "is predicted by qcd and compared with the observed fragmentation function at these energies . in the following sections the parametrisation of the @xmath13 dependence and the @xmath12 dependence of the fragmentation functions will be discussed .",
    "the fragmentation functions have been studied in great detail in @xmath9 annihilation .",
    "even such details as the `` string effect '' , predicted in qcd by the interference effects of multiple gluon emission , have been observed@xcite and can be well described by the string fragmentation model@xcite .",
    "although any parametrisation of the @xmath13 dependence at a given @xmath12 would suffice , we have chosen the string model for the following reasons :    * the quark and gluon fragmentation functions are described by the @xmath85 string with the same parameters , thus reducing the number of free parameters .",
    "* in this model soft gluons are automatically `` absorbed '' in the string , i.e. they only produce some transverse momentum to the string , but do not lead to independent jets . in independent fragmentation models the fragmentation of soft gluons is problematic because of phase space restrictions for hadron production .",
    "* quark mass effects are taken into account in the string model .",
    "hadrons inside a jet are characterised by the limited transverse momenta with respect to the jet axis independent of the jet energy and the longitudinal momentum spectra .",
    "these momentum components can be parametrised by two energy independent functions , a longitudinal and a transverse fragmentation function .",
    "italics have been used here in order to distinguish these parametrisations at a reference energy from the fragmentation function @xmath17 .",
    "the transverse momentum spectrum was parametrised by a gaussian with a variance of ( @xmath86  mev / c)@xmath65@xcite .",
    "the longitudinal momentum spectra of light and heavy quarks are parametrised differently since the latter have much harder spectra because of their larger mass .",
    "the lund symmetric @xmath87 function@xcite was used for the light quarks : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the transverse mass of the hadron , @xmath90 determines the fraction of the primordial parton energy taken by the hadron @xmath15 , with @xmath91 , indicating the parton with energy @xmath92 and longitudinal momentum @xmath93 ; @xmath94 and @xmath95 are two free parameters .",
    "the longitudinal spectrum depends mainly on @xmath96 which scales like @xmath97 , where @xmath97 is the total multiplicity , so effectively there is only one free parameter . for the heavy quarks ( @xmath95 and @xmath98 ) the peterson @xmath87 function@xcite was used : @xmath99^{-2}\\ ] ] here the free parameter , @xmath100 , is expected to vary as @xmath101 , so @xmath102 was used .",
    "hence there are only two free parameters to tune the momentum spectrum ( @xmath94 and @xmath103 ) .",
    "the parameters determining the fraction of strange quarks picked up from the vacuum , the ratio of vector to pseudoscalar mesons , the fraction of baryons , as well as the decay parameters were all left at their default values , since a good description of the @xmath13 dependence was possible with these .",
    "the @xmath12 dependence of the fragmentation function can be derived either from the evolution equations or from a direct numerical integration of the exact qcd matrix element .",
    "since the splitting functions have been derived from the integration of the matrix element , both methods are , in principle , equivalent",
    ". however , higher order differences might occur . as will be discussed in the section on systematic errors ,",
    "these differences are small .",
    "therefore , the @xmath12 dependence has been determined from the integration of the exact second order qcd matrix element , using the formulae from reference @xcite , which have been implemented in the lund string model@xcite .",
    "this method has the advantage that the convolution of the splitting and fragmentation functions is done in a consistent manner , i.e. the cuts to separate the nonperturbative region from the perturbative one are the same for the splitting and fragmentation functions .",
    "these cuts will be discussed in more detail in the section on systematic errors .",

    "a good agreement was observed for all @xmath13 values with the @xmath85 fragmentation parameters at both 35 and 91 gev , so the difference between the energies depended on @xmath46 only .",

    "the whole analysis , including the parametrisation of the @xmath13 dependence , was repeated with this model .",
    "the fit quality was similar and the value of @xmath46 was not changed outside the experimental errors , again indicating that fragmentation uncertainties largely cancel in the difference between the spectra at different energies .",
    "half the difference between the different fragmentation models ( 9 mev ) was taken conservatively as the error for fragmentation .",
    "*   + as mentioned before , the renormalisation scale is a free parameter ; ^(5 ) _",
    "@xmath66  would be independent of the choice of this scale if all higher order corrections were known .",
    "however , in a fixed order calculation a lower scale implies a larger value of _ s @xmath6 . for the 3-jet cross section",
    "the change in the born cross section can be compensated by a different coefficient in the higher order correction .",
    "however , the 4-jet cross section is only known up to the born term in second order qcd , so a lower scale for the argument of _ s",
    "@xmath6  implies a higher 4-jet rate .",
    "the @xmath118 of the fit did not change significantly by changing the scale , but ^(5 ) _",
    "@xmath66  varied from 190 to 270 mev if the scale was changed from @xmath140 to @xmath110 , which corresponded to a change in _",
    "s @xmath6from 0.115 to 0.121 ( see fig . [ f5 ] ) . thus this error , originating from the unknown higher order corrections , has been found to be dominant , as in all other _",
    "s @xmath6  determinations@xcite .",
    "the scale dependence was still relatively small , since we studied the difference between the spectra at different energies , so higher order contributions and fragmentation effects partially cancel .",
    "similar observations hold for other `` difference '' variables , like the asymmetry in the energy - energy correlations ( aeec ) or the difference in jet masses@xcite . +",
    "an independent estimate of the higher order contributions can be obtained from the equations ( [ ap ] ) : in these equations the higher order terms are taken into account by exponentiating the leading logarithms proportional to @xmath141 , which appear as leading terms in a calculation to order @xmath142 .",
    "the difference of these terms between @xmath143 and @xmath144 is proportional to @xmath145 . since in our case",
    "the difference in @xmath146 and @xmath147 is only a factor three , the exponentiated form of the leading logarithms will be close to its second order expansion , so the higher order contributions are expected to be small .",
    "this can be checked explicitly by integrating these equations in @xmath142 steps . since at each step",
    "a gluon can be emitted , this corresponds to summing up all higher order terms proportional to @xmath148 .",
    "the change in scaling violation between 30 and 90 gev was found to be less than 5% if @xmath142 was varied between 2 and 20 , so this change is similar to the uncertainty from the scale dependence .",
    "since this exercise was done only in first order , using the program from reference @xcite , the larger range from the scale dependence was used as an estimate of the error from the unknown higher order corrections .",
    "*   + as mentioned before , the fragmentation of quarks involves a large number of soft and collinear gluons .",
    "hence , a cut - off on the isolation of the gluons was used in order to decide whether a gluon should be part of the quark fragmentation or if it should fragment independently .",
    "below this cut the quarks and gluons were considered to fragment into a single jet , i.e. they were considered to belong to the non - perturbative regime in the model and were recombined beforehand .",
    "+ as a cut - off , the minimum invariant mass between quarks and gluons was required to be above 9.1 gev / c@xmath65 .",
    "the scaling violations were not very sensitive to this cut , since they just required a different parametrisation of the nonperturbative part for a different cut .",
    "what mattered was a good parametrisation of the @xmath13 dependence .",
    "the cut could not be decreased , since with this cut practically all phase space was already used at the highest energy , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f3a ] . decreasing the cut",
    "further would cause the 4-jet cross section to become so large and positive , that the 3-jet cross section would become negative in some regions of phase space due to the large and negative virtual corrections in the second order qcd matrix element in that case . increasing the minimum invariant mass squared by a factor two resulted in an increase of @xmath46 of 60 mev .",
    "therefore an error of @xmath149 mev was attributed , although part of this was presumably already absorbed in the scale error : increasing the cut - off or increasing the renormalisation scale increased @xmath46 in both cases , as expected for a decrease of the higher order contributions from multiple gluon radiation in both cases .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] , which shows the phase space of 4-jet events at an energy of 91 gev for the default parameters ( @xmath84=0.01 and @xmath150=0.01 ) at the top and the changes if @xmath84 is increased to 1 and @xmath150 to 0.02 . for these cases the total 4-jet rate decreases from 28% at the default value to @xmath151 and 9% , respectively .",
    "note that the change from the change in the @xmath150 cut is not only at the border , as one might naively expect .",
    "this can be understood , if one realizes that the cut converts many 4-jet events into 3-jet events , which can be located anywhere in the allowed phase space .",
    "consequently , the variations of @xmath150 and @xmath84 change the higher order corrections in a vary similar manner and by counting them as independent contributions to the total systematic error is a conservative attitude .",
    "the total errors were obtained by adding in quadrature the errors from the fit @xmath152  mev ) , from the @xmath13-dependence ( 10 mev ) , from heavy quark fractions ( 10 mev ) , from fragmentation ( 9 mev ) , from the comparison between experiments ( 15 mev ) , from the gluon cut - off dependence ( 30 mev ) and from the scale dependence ( 40 mev ) .",
    "a summary of the systematic errors is given in table [ t7 ] .",
    "a precise determination of the fragmentation function in the decay of the @xmath0 boson has been presented .",
    "a comparison with the fragmentation functions at lower energies shows a strong scaling violation , which leads in second order to a qcd scale ^(5 ) _",
    "@xmath66  between 190 and 270 mev ( see table [ t0 ] ) .",
    "taking the average as the central value and using the total uncertainties as given in table [ t7 ] resulted in @xmath153 mev , which corresponds to @xmath154    these results in the time - like region are in good agreement with the results on scaling violation from deep inelastic lepton nucleon scattering ( space - like region ;",
    "@xmath155 @xcite ) and with other @xmath8 determinations at lep from jet rates and shape variables ( @xmath156 @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted that future @xmath9 linear colliders can operate over a large energy range , which allows a study of the scaling violations with a @xmath157 detector .",
    "for example , a 500 gev linear collider can measure a large scaling violation by running for a short time ath the 91 gev @xmath0 peak . from fig .",
    "[ f7 ] it can be seen that the expected scaling violation will be even larger than the one observed between 35 and 91 gev , thus allowing a precise determination of @xmath46 at high @xmath12 within a single experiment .",
