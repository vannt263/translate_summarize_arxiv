    "general relativity is the most successful theory for describing nature at scales in which gravitational interactions become important .",
    "therefore , it is the best theoretical tool to describe local gravitational interactions of massive objects and in addition to describe how the universe evolves as a whole .",
    "one of the most striking astrophysical observations that utterly changed our perspectives about the cosmological evolution came in the late 90 s and according to these , the universe has undergone two accelerating phases .",
    "the first accelerating phase is the inflation period and the second is the present epoch s acceleration , which is referred to as dark energy . the new planck telescope observational data corresponding to the present epoch indicate that the universe is described by the @xmath2 model with the main features of this model being that the universe is nearly spatially flat , and consists of ordinary matter ( @xmath3 ) , cold dark matter ( @xmath4 ) and dark energy ( @xmath5 ) .    a very theoretically consistent and promising description of the dark energy and the late time acceleration this generates , is provided by the so called @xmath0 modified theories of gravity . for informative reviews and very important papers on these theories ,",
    "consult @xcite and references therein . in these theories",
    "what changes drastically is the right hand side of the einstein equations . in order to obtain accelerating solutions of the friedmann - robertson - walker equations ,",
    "the energy momentum tensor necessarily must contain a negative @xmath6 fluid , a feature naturally provided by these @xmath0 theories .",
    "more importantly and surprisingly , early time inflation and late time acceleration may successfully described by @xmath0 theories @xcite . the possibility to unify early - time inflation with late - time acceleration in @xmath0 gravity",
    "was explicitly demonstrated in the nojiri - odintsov model @xcite .",
    "moreover , exact solutions in strong gravitational background have been presented in @xcite .",
    "in addition , an important stream of papers on modified gravitational theories with non - minimal curvature matter coupling can be found in @xcite .",
    "notice that in the present paper when we use the expression non - minimal coupling , we mean the term containing the scalar field coupled to the curvature , which can be generally of the form @xmath7 , with @xmath8 the curvature scalar and @xmath9 the scalar field @xcite . in this fashion , even the brans - dicke model is a non - minimally coupled scalar - tensor theory @xcite , and also assume that there exists no direct coupling between matter and the curvature scalar .",
    "since @xmath0 theories serve as consistent generalizations of general relativity , these theories are confronted with the successes of general relativity and a large number of constraints need to be satisfied , in order a modified gravity theory can be considered as viable .",
    "most of these constraints are imposed from local tests of general relativity , coming from planetary and star formation tests and additionally from various cosmological bounds . moreover , since each jordan frame @xmath0 theory has a scalar - tensor gravitational theory counterpart in the einstein frame , the scalarons of this counterpart theory have to be classical , so that quantum - mechanical stability is ensured .    with regard to the constraints imposed on @xmath0 theory , in this article we shall indicate another source of constraints that can be imposed to @xmath0 theories to ensure their viability .",
    "these constraints come from primordial black holes and their evolution in a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw hereafter ) cosmological background",
    ".    primordial black holes ( pbh hereafter ) are light black holes that can be formed in the early universe , probably after the inflationary period of the universe ends ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "these black holes can be the result of various formation ways , for example collapsing of large density perturbations , cosmic string loops and bubble collisions . since the evaporation of pbh is inevitable ( if these radiate particles in the normal way )",
    ", there exist a number of constraints on these objects .",
    "moreover , since some formation mechanisms include large density perturbations , the pbh power spectrum of density perturbations on small scales can be used to constrain models of inflation .",
    "in addition , since pbh are formed in a time before nucleosynthesis , pbh can serve for a potential cold dark matter candidate .",
    "the focus in this paper is on specific evolution aspects of pbh , from the point of view of @xmath0 related scalar - tensor theories .",
    "we shall assume that the pbh have an evaporation time equal to the present age of the universe , discussing only the other possibility that the pbh do not have evaporation time equal to the present age of the universe .",
    "the evaporation time determines the initial mass of the pbh , which depends on the gravitational constant at the time of formation , if gravitational memory takes place @xcite .",
    "we shall study the evolution of pbh , using two scalar - tensor models , adopting the gravitational memory effect introduced by barrow @xcite , which states that the pbh carries information about the value of the gravitational constant at the time of its formation .",
    "this can potentially constrain the viable @xmath0 models that exist in the literature , assuming always that the gravitational memory effect is valid . in addition , since in @xmath0 theories the anti - evaporation of black holes is possible @xcite , we briefly discuss the possibility that a pbh develops to be a supermassive black hole during the evolution process of the universe .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in section 1 , we present the general features of @xmath0 theories in the jordan frame in the metric formalism . in section 2",
    ", we introduce a general class of scalar - tensor theories we shall use and demonstrate their equivalence to @xmath0 theories using a specific weyl transformation .",
    "the two scalar - tensor models predict late - time acceleration .",
    "in addition , we study the evolution of the gravitational constant for both the scalar - tensor models and show that the results may vary significantly .",
    "we also analyze the evolution of pbh using these two solutions coming from the scalar - tensor models .",
    "moreover , we compare the results with two brans - dicke models .",
    "as we shall see , one of the two scalar - tensor models has un - realistic implications for the pbh and therefore this result should be critically taken into account . in section 3",
    ", we briefly discuss the possibility that pbh , if these are linked to @xmath0 theories of gravity , can develop to be supermassive black holes .",
    "this is possible since anti - evaporating black holes occur in @xmath0 theories .",
    "some antigravity issues are briefly discussed in the end of section 3 and the conclusions follow in the end of the article .",
    "before getting into the core of the article s subject , it worths giving a brief description of the main features of @xmath0 gravity theories in the jordan frame .",
    "for an important stream of reviews and articles see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the @xmath0 theories of modified gravity are described by the following four dimensional action , which is a direct modification of the einstein - hilbert action : @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 the matter action of the matter fields @xmath13 .",
    "we shall assume that the form of the @xmath0 theory that we shall use is of the form @xmath14 and also we shall work in the metric formalism . within the metric formalism context , by varying the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to @xmath15 , we get the equations of motion : @xmath16 in the above , @xmath17 and @xmath18 stands for the energy momentum tensor .    the underlying theme and the most important feature of the @xmath0 modified gravity theories is that , the right hand side of the einstein equations are modified and not the left . indeed , we can write the above equations of motion in the following form : @xmath19}\\big{)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thereby , the energy momentum tensor acquires an additional contribution coming from the term : @xmath20},\\ ] ] and this term is what actually models the dark energy in these modified gravity theories .",
    "by taking the trace of equation ( [ eqnmotion ] ) we obtain the following equation : @xmath21 with @xmath22 standing for the trace of the energy momentum tensor @xmath23 , while @xmath24 , @xmath25 stand for the energy density and pressure of the matter respectively .",
    "equation ( [ traceeqn ] ) actually reveals another degree of freedom of the @xmath0 theories , governed by the scalar field @xmath26 .",
    "actually , equation ( [ traceeqn ] ) is the equation of motion of this scalar degree of freedom , which is nothing but the `` scalaron '' field . considering a flat friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker spacetime ,",
    "the ricci scalar is given by : @xmath27 with @xmath28 denoting the hubble parameter , and the `` dot '' indicates differentiation with respect to time .",
    "the cosmological dynamics are governed by the following equations : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 stand for the radiation and matter energy density respectively .",
    "therefore , the total effective energy density and pressure of matter and geometry are @xcite : @xmath32 } \\\\",

    "consider the following action describing a non - minimal coupled scalar field to the ricci scalar @xmath8 , in @xmath34dimensions : @xmath35}\\ ] ] this type of scalar - tensor models was extensively studied in reference @xcite , for the four dimensional case and are known to produce late - time acceleration in both the einstein and jordan frames @xcite .",
    "notice that the effective gravitational constant in the jordan frame for this type of theories is : @xmath36      let us start our analysis by demonstrating that the scalar - tensor theories described by the action ( [ generaleqn ] ) can be equivalent to @xmath0 theories",
    ". usually in the literature one actually starts from an @xmath0 theory and ends up to a non - minimally coupled scalar - tensor theory , which is actually a brans - dicke theory with @xmath37 equal to zero ( see @xcite and particularly odintsov and nojiri ( 2007 ) and felice , tsujikawa ( 2010 ) ) . a similar method to the one we shall use appears in @xcite , but applied in four dimensions . before going into the details , it worths recalling how the equivalence between metric @xmath0 theories and scalar - tensor theories with non - minimal coupling ( brans - dicke theories with @xmath38 ) is established in the literature .",
    "following @xcite , consider the general @xmath0 theory with matter , which is described by the action : @xmath39 using the lagrange multipliers method , we introduce an auxiliary field @xmath40 which acts as a lagrange multiplier , and so the action ( [ actionlagmult ] ) becomes : @xmath41 with @xmath42 standing for the first derivative of the function @xmath43 with respect to @xmath40 .",
    "varying the action ( [ actionlagmult1 ] ) with respect to @xmath40 one obtains : @xmath44 given that @xmath45 , which is true for most interesting @xmath0 theories , we may conclude that @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , the action ( [ actionlagmult1 ] ) recovers the initial @xmath0-gravity action ( [ actionlagmult1 ] ) .",
    "defining , @xmath47 the action of equation ( [ actionlagmult1 ] ) can be expressed as a function of the field @xmath48 as follows : @xmath49}+s_m(g_{\\mu \\nu},\\psi_m)\\ ] ] with the potential @xmath50 being equal to : @xmath51 the function @xmath52 can be obtained by solving the algebraic equation ( [ newdef ] ) with respect to @xmath53 , so that @xmath40 is a function of @xmath48 . from equation ( [ actionlagmult123 ] ) , it easily follows that the @xmath0 theories in the metric formalism are equivalent to brans - dicke theories with the parameter @xmath37 equal to zero",
    ". therefore the metric @xmath0 theories are equivalent to non - minimally coupled scalar - tensor theories with @xmath54 .",
    "mark this latter constraint , that is , the disappearance of the kinetic term of the scalar field , because it will appear as a constraint in the method we shall use .    in the method we shall present",
    ", we shall mainly be interested in metrics that belong to the conformal structure of the pseudo - riemannian manifold under study .",
    "we shall take into account two metrics which are conformally related to each other .",
    "this conformal relation is materialized by a weyl rescaling of one of the two metrics , which we shall assume to be of the following form , @xmath55 with @xmath56 an arbitrary real function of the scalar field @xmath57 and where it appears @xmath58 .",
    "note that @xmath59 . in the same way @xmath60 .",
    "the manifold we shall assume as a geometrical background is a pseudo - riemannian one , which is described by a lorentz metric ( which in most cases is the frw metric ) and a symmetric ( torsion - less ) compatible with the metric affine connection , the levi - civita connection .",
    "the christoffel symbols in such a geometric background is : @xmath61 and additionally , the ricci scalar is equal to : @xmath62 under the weyl rescaling ( [ weylrescale ] ) , the ricci scalar term appearing in the action ( [ generaleqn ] ) is transformed in the following way : @xmath63 with , @xmath64 and in addition , @xmath65 accordingly , the action of relation ( [ generaleqn ] ) now becomes : @xmath66}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we assumed that the surface term @xmath67 .",
    "the action ( [ generaleqn1 ] ) can be re - written as follows : @xmath68}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now the equivalence of action ( [ generaleqn2 ] ) to @xmath0 theories depends crucially on the following choice ,",
    "@xmath69 ^ 2+\\frac{\\omega(\\phi)}{2}=0\\ ] ] if ( [ algbreqn ] ) holds true , then the action ( [ generaleqn2 ] ) can be rewritten as follows : @xmath70}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the constraint ( [ algbreqn ] ) makes the kinetic term of relation ( [ generaleqn2 ] ) disappear , that is , the term analogous to @xmath71 . recall that on going from @xmath0 theories to their equivalent scalar - tensor theories , we also end up to a scalar - tensor theory with the kinetic term of the scalar field being equal to zero ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "now we may obtain an @xmath0 theory in a straightforward way , by inverting @xmath72 using equation ( [ algbreqn ] ) and solving with respect to @xmath57 .",
    "then , the corresponding @xmath73 theory is described by the action : @xmath74 with @xmath73 standing for : @xmath75 so having established the equivalence under certain assumptions ( which actually is relation ( [ algbreqn ] ) and the vanishing of the surface term we saw previously ) between a general scalar - tensor theory of type ( [ generaleqn ] ) and @xmath0 theories , let us examine two scalar - tensor models with appealing attributes regarding their cosmological implications in both the einstein and jordan frames .",
    "particularly , we shall focus on the impact of these solutions to the gravitational memory effect in pbh containing the phantom matter of the form ( [ generaleqn ] ) in dimensions four .    before closing this subsection , we have to mention that we assumed the @xmath0 theory has no direct coupling to the matter lagrangian .",
    "however , there exists in the literature the particularly interesting case in which the @xmath0 theory is directly coupled to the matter lagrangian @xcite , leading to new interesting phenomena , such as the prediction of a fifth force @xcite .",
    "we defer in a future work the study of such @xmath0 theories in the context of gravitational memory .",
    "in addition , a study of the same phenomena in the palatini formalism also deserves some attention which are beyond the scope of this article .    a final comment regarding the technique we used .",
    "one may naturally ask why such an essential ansatz described by relation ( [ algbreqn ] ) is needed in order to establish an equivalence between a general non - minimally coupled scalar - tensor theory ( not just a brans - dicke model with a potential and @xmath38 ) and an @xmath0 theory .",
    "the answer to this was given partially in the above text but it worths to answer this issue in order to make things much more clear . in principle",
    "our technique describes that every non - minimally coupled scalar - tensor theory can have a specific @xmath0 counterpart .",
    "this @xmath0 theory has to satisfy equation ( [ algbreqn ] ) , so its not a general @xmath0 theory , but belongs to some restricted class of @xmath0 theories .",
    "note that there is not a direct coupling to matter , at least in the lagrangian level , which is conceptually different from the @xmath0 theories that were studied in @xcite .",
    "the constraint ( [ algbreqn ] ) is very essential and it is conceptually similar to the requirement that the final @xmath0 theory is in some way related to a scalar - tensor theory without kinetic term for the scalar field , which is described by the conformally transformed action ( [ generaleqn2 ] ) ( something that happens naturally when one goes from @xmath0 theories to scalar - tensor theories as we described earlier ) .",
    "a similar ansatz was also used by the authors of @xcite , but in a different context .",
    "we believe this constraint is the link between the two completely different methods describing the two ways from going from scalar - tensor theories to @xmath0 theories and back . indeed ,",
    "if we start from a general @xmath0 theory , we end up to a non - minimally coupled scalar - tensor theory with vanishing kinetic term of the scalar field and with a potential term of the scalar field ( a brans - dicke theory with @xmath76 and a potential term ) .",
    "action ( [ generaleqn2 ] ) describes a non - minimally coupled scalar - tensor theory with vanishing kinetic term ( assuming that equation ( [ algbreqn ] ) holds true ) which , with the aid of the constraint ( [ algbreqn ] ) , can be equivalent to an @xmath0 theory .",
    "moreover action ( [ generaleqn2 ] ) is conformally related to a non - minimally coupled scalar - tensor theory with non - vanishing kinetic term described by action ( [ generaleqn ] ) .",
    "gravitational memory of black holes @xcite is an effect according to which each black hole is considered as a small gravitational structure in an expanding universe .",
    "this means that a pbh retains information about the time it was formed , since the gravitational constant inside the pbh remains the one it was at the time of its formation , but outside the black hole the gravitational constant evolves with time .",
    "suppose that the pbh was formed at a time @xmath1 and let the gravitational constant at the time of its formation be @xmath77 .",
    "then the evolution of each pbh can be significantly altered depending on its initial mass .",
    "since the pbh are losing energy by hawking radiation , which is directly affected by gravitational memory , this effect can have significant observational implications which strongly depend on the initial mass of the pbh and on the @xmath77 value .",
    "there are three possibilities for the initial mass @xmath78 of the pbh :    * @xmath79 * @xmath80 * @xmath81    where @xmath82 is the critical initial mass of pbh which are considered to be completely evaporated at present time , so the evaporation time is equal to the present age of the universe .",
    "we shall study the pbh that are exactly of this type , so they have initial mass equal to @xmath82 .",
    "we shall discuss possible constraints that the other two cases can impose on @xmath0 theories , in the end of this section .",
    "of course the case in which @xmath80 can also constrain some @xmath0 theories by allowing or not their scalar - tensor counterparts .",
    "we shall briefly discuss these constraints in the end of this section .",
    "having assumed that the pbh has a total evaporation time equal to the present age of the universe , let us see what this implies for the initial mass of a pbh .",
    "the initial mass of a pbh is of the order of the particle horizon : @xmath83 the evaporation procedure follows the hawking radiation law , according to which the pbh emits particles like a blackbody with rate @xcite : @xmath84 with @xmath85 the number of particle species which can be emitted , that is , with rest mass below @xmath86 .",
    "the total evaporation time for a initial mass @xmath78 pbh is : @xmath87 recall that @xmath1 is the time when the pbh was formed and notice that the gravitational constant at that time @xmath77 , determines both the hawking temperature and the lifetime of pbh .",
    "now , in our case for which the lifetime equals the present age of the universe @xmath88 , then the initial mass is the critical mass @xmath89 : @xmath90 accordingly , the hawking temperature for such critical mass pbh is : @xmath91 assume that the time at which the pbh were formed is @xmath92 ( the same as used in barrow @xcite ) , after the inflationary period ( started at @xmath93sec and ended at @xmath94 ) has ended and before baryogenesis . of course we may vary the initial time of formation but we are not so interested to exact phenomenology but just to have a solid idea of the general picture .",
    "now let us see the implications of two scalar - tensor models of the type ( [ generaleqn1 ] ) in dimensions four , on the gravitational memory effect and compare the results of these to the ones obtained from a brans - dicke model with and without cosmological constant .",
    "note that both the models we shall present are equivalent to an @xmath0 theory .",
    "we use the models studied in reference @xcite . before going into the details of the two models ,",
    "let us note that the models we shall study have a time varying gravitational constant that can have direct impact on observational data of pbh .",
    "therefore , the gravitational memory effect can in some way constrain @xmath0 theories via constraining their equivalent scalar - tensor theories .",
    "note however that the models we shall use are just for exposition purposes only and we should consistently add matter to these in order to get a detailed phenomenology .      a model that leads to late time acceleration , that is , acceleration that has recently started in the redshift scale , was studied in reference @xcite .",
    "the model is described by the jordan frame action appearing in equation ( [ generaleqn ] ) , in four dimensions , with the function @xmath95 being equal to : @xmath96 the kinetic function @xmath97 and the potential @xmath98 , appearing ( [ generaleqn ] ) , for the function ( [ fder ] ) are equal to : @xmath99 note that in these kind of models described by relation ( [ generaleqn1 ] ) in dimensions four , the energy density and the pressure of the scalar field @xmath57 are equal to : @xmath100 with the function @xmath101 being equal to : @xmath102 and also the function @xmath103 is equal to : @xmath104 when the model is considered in the jordan frame , the effective gravitational constant is time - dependent and varies as the field @xmath105 varies with time .",
    "particularly , in the case of the function ( [ fder ] ) the effective gravitational constant is equal to ( see equation ( [ effgravcnst ] ) ) : @xmath106 assuming a spatially flat frw metric of the form , @xmath107 with @xmath108 the scale factor , we may solve the cosmological equations of motion , with the solution @xmath105 corresponding to the model ( [ fder ] ) in the jordan frame being equal to @xcite : @xmath109 note that the specific model has the particularly interesting attribute of giving late time acceleration in both the einstein frame and in the jordan frame .",
    "we shall be mostly interested in the jordan frame solution , in which the gravitational constant varies with respect to time as follows : @xmath110 with @xmath111 a model dependent constant .",
    "now suppose that the universe is filled with this scalar field at the time of pbh formation and suppose the pbh was formed at some time @xmath92sec after the big bang . in what follows we shall use the fraction @xmath112 , with @xmath88 the present time .",
    "we shall assume that the pbh have formed according to the gravitational memory effect we described earlier and in addition , that the pbh have mass which is equal to the critical mass ( [ inmasscrit ] ) and also the hawking temperature at present time is given by ( [ hawktmpre ] ) .",
    "what is actually severely changed in the pbh evolution , in the context of gravitational memory , is the temperature and mass of pbh which undergo a complete evaporation today .",
    "notice that the appearance of the fraction @xmath112 in both relations ( [ inmasscrit ] ) and ( [ hawktmpre ] ) , may severely alter the present day observable effects of pbh emission of particles .",
    "it is therefore crucial for the present model to evaluate the fraction @xmath112 , which is equal to : @xmath113 using the present value of @xmath114 , and for @xmath92sec , the above fraction is approximately equal to : @xmath115 for the present model .",
    "of course this can vary since it depends on @xmath111 , which we took equal to one .",
    "nevertheless , we have an idea of the order of the fraction .",
    "let us see what this implies for the pbh particle emission in present time . according to barrow ,",
    "and it can be easily verified from relations ( [ inmasscrit ] ) and ( [ hawktmpre ] ) , for @xmath116 , the evaporation hawking temperature of the pbh is approximately equal to @xmath117mev , which is below the electron rest mass and therefore the possibility of observing black hole explosions via the observation of gamma ray and radio bursts created by relativistic electron and positrons @xcite .",
    "this result can be modified depending the initial value of the constant @xmath111 , which is model dependent .",
    "the value of this constant may determine the late time acceleration of the scalar - tensor model .",
    "for example a hawking temperature in the kev scale and the photon emission from pbh is mainly in the x - ray band and massive particles would not be emitted ( apart from light mass particles ) .    finally , let us note that , as we evinced earlier , the scalar - tensor theory described by the function ( [ fder ] ) , corresponds to an @xmath0 theory which can be found by making use of relations ( [ algbreqn ] ) and ( [ frequation ] ) .",
    "therefore , we may impose some indirect constraints on the @xmath0 theory by constraining the corresponding scalar - tensor theory using gravitational memory and present time black hole evaporation data in various bands .",
    "the complete study of various @xmath0 models by using gravitational memory of pbh will be reported in a future work .",
    "the second scalar - tensor model we shall study also comes from reference @xcite and is described by the jordan frame action appearing in equation ( [ generaleqn ] ) , in four dimensions , with the function @xmath118 this time being equal : @xmath119 then , the kinetic function @xmath97 and the potential @xmath98 , are equal to : @xmath120 therefore , the effective time - dependent gravitational constant is equal to ( see equation ( [ effgravcnst ] ) ) : @xmath121 again assuming a spatially flat frw metric of the form ( [ metricformfrw ] ) , the solution @xmath105 corresponding to the model ( [ fder1 ] ) in the jordan frame is @xcite : @xmath122 and thereby the gravitational constant varies with respect to time as follows : @xmath123 we can easily calculate the fraction @xmath112 , which in this case is equal to : @xmath124 giving the same numerical values to the parameters as we did in the previous model , we obtain an estimate for the value of the fraction @xmath112 , which is approximately equal to : @xmath125 accordingly , the hawking temperature of such a pbh is @xmath126mev , which is huge and highly unphysical , since we would have noticed all the heaviest particles coming from such evaporations . therefore , we may conclude that the second scalar - tensor model probably produces unphysical results when the gravitational memory of critical pbh is taken into account .",
    "note however that in the derivation of the cosmological solution @xmath105 , we only took into account the scalar field energy density and pressure and we neglected matter .",
    "in addition , the fact that we found unphysical results , does not necessarily means that the model must be excluded right away .",
    "this argument is based on the fact that we assumed that the pbh mass is critical , that is , it evaporates today . however , the initial mass of the black hole may have been larger or smaller in comparison to the critical mass .",
    "this means that the pbh may have already evaporated in the past or may evaporate completely in the future .",
    "these scenarios bring along more constraints that have to be taken into account , like entropy production bounds , cosmological nucleosynthesis bounds , microwave background spectrum bounds , see for example @xcite . in this paper",
    "our interest was mainly for the critical mass case .      in order to have a clear idea on how the scalar - tensor models behave as the time varies",
    ", we shall compare the solutions ( [ phit1 ] ) and ( [ phit11 ] ) , with the ones corresponding to the simplest scalar - tensor theory , namely brans - dicke model , with and without cosmological constant .",
    "we must have in mind that we did not include any matter content in the scalar - tensor models we used in the previous sections , but we will use matter profiles for the brans - dicke model . the general action in the jordan frame describing a brans - dicke model with cosmological constant and matter is : @xmath127}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     as a function of t , for brans - dicke models with and without cosmological constant with model 1 and model 2 .",
    "the time axis has been properly rescaled .",
    "the same applies for the y - axis . ]    by varying with respect to the metric and with respect to the scalar field , we obtain the einstein equations describing the cosmological evolution of the brans - dicke model , which for a flat frw metric are equal to : @xmath128 where @xmath129 .",
    "a particularly simple solution exists if we assume that the matter density is @xmath130 and in addition @xmath131 , which is the following , @xmath132 hence , the effective gravitational constant is : @xmath133 recall that @xmath134 .",
    "we shall use the usual values appearing in the literature , in reference to the parameters @xmath135 , with @xmath136 .",
    "the comparison of the brans - dicke model with cosmological constant with the two scalar models appears in figure 1 , where we have properly rescaled the time axis and the @xmath137-axis .",
    "we can work out the brans - dicke model without cosmological constant to see how this modifies the field evolution . in this case",
    "we shall consider another matter profile , of the form @xmath138 , with @xmath139 .",
    "the solution @xmath140 in the jordan frame reads , @xmath141 and so the effective gravitational constant is : @xmath142 the comparison of solution ( [ soltionbdwcc ] ) , with the other three solutions appears also in figure 1 .",
    "unlike how ordinary black holes are formed , pbh originate from non - collapsing stellar matter and particularly are formed from primordial density fluctuations .",
    "imagine the evolution of an initial schwarzschild - de sitter primordial black hole with it s mass given by the following relation @xmath143 with @xmath1 the time at which the black hole was formed and @xmath88 the present age of the universe . in certain @xmath0 theories",
    "there is the possibility of obtaining anti - evaporating black holes @xcite , see for example @xcite .",
    "hence , by suitably choosing the parameters , we may start with an initial pbh with mass @xmath78 which will increase in time .",
    "this black hole will develop to be a supermassive black hole and instead of being evaporated by it s own hawking radiation , it will have an exponential increase in it s mass ( see also @xcite ) , @xmath144 notice that the supermassive black hole of this type will carry information related to the time of it s creation , since the initial mass @xmath78 depends on the gravitational constant @xmath77 at the time @xmath1 .",
    "work is in progress to find a potential candidate @xmath0 theory that gives acceptable cosmological features and anti - evaporation of black holes at the same time .",
    "since this task is beyond the scopes of this article , we defer this work to a future article .",
    "the possibility that a pbh may develop to be a supermassive black hole was extensively studied in reference @xcite .      as a final task",
    ", we shall briefly discuss what happens in the case we take into account gravitational memory in antigravity regimes .",
    "antigravity regions are possible in the context of @xmath0 theories @xcite .",
    "if our universe enters an antigravity phase , then the formation of black holes and other astrophysical objects is not so likely .",
    "this is owing to the fact that any particle will repel all other particles and even though local density fluctuations may exist , in the end there is no gravitational attraction . even if we take into account the speculative scenario that antimatter repels always matter , in an antigravity regime matter repels matter and antimatter .",
    "if however antimatter attracts matter in an antigravity phase of the universe and if matter repels matter , maybe this could lead to the formation of heavy astrophysical objects . in addition",
    ", a smooth transition from antigravity to gravity could lead to decoupling of matter from antimatter , having in mind that matter and antimatter repel each other in normal gravity phases . if the gravitational objects that were formed at the antigravity phase would have negative hawking temperature and negative gravitational constant .",
    "however , there can be no smooth transition from antigravity to gravity phase , see @xcite and references therein . particularly , in reference",
    "@xcite an antigravity scalar - tensor model of the following form was studied : @xmath145}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding @xmath0 gravity can be easily obtained using the method of section 1 ( see reference @xcite ) and is equal to : @xmath146 with @xmath0 standing for : @xmath147 in addition , the real function @xmath148 is chosen in such a way so that the following equation is satisfied : @xmath149 so that the kinetic term of the scalar field is eliminated .",
    "this model clearly provides us with a negative gravitational constant for some values of the scalar field @xmath9 , this however is not a smooth transition indicating a big crunch - big bang transition .",
    "what would be interesting is to invert the coupling of the ricci scalar but this however would imply some sort of instability in the action .",
    "bottom line , if in an antigravity phase of the universe it is possible to have formation of gravitational objects , gravitational memory would have resulted to a negative hawking temperature for these gravitational objects . but as we mentioned , this scenario is speculative and work is in progress towards this issue .",
    "in this paper we studied the effect of gravitational memory on pbh , in the theoretical context of @xmath0 related scalar - tensor theories .",
    "we used a particular form of scalar - tensor theories with a non - minimally coupled scalar field and we demonstrated the equivalence of the scalar - tensor theory with an @xmath0 theory . using two characteristic examples , we examined the impact of gravitational memory on pbh that formed sometime in the early universe .",
    "we assumed that the mass of the pbh is such that the black hole evaporates at present time and then used the specifics of each model in order to see the implications on black hole observable data .",
    "as we evinced , one of the two models produces observable quantities that would not agree with present time observational data .",
    "this implies that either the gravitational memory mechanism is un - realistic or the mass of the initial pbh is not the critical one , that is equal to the mass of a pbh that evaporates today . in any case",
    ", the gravitational memory provides us with another useful theoretical tool to further constrain the @xmath0 theories to which the scalar - tensor theories are connected with . the purpose of this article was to point the possibility of existence of gravitational memory and to indicate what would this imply to early universe astrophysical objects . it worths examining viable models to explicitly see what impact would these solutions have , bearing in mind that the gravitational memory hypothesis is valid .",
    "in addition , the possibility of the formation of supermassive black holes from pbh which are anti - evaporating black holes of some @xmath0 theory , should also be extensively discussed .",
    "we defer these tasks to a future work .    before closing , let us comment that it would be particularly interesting to address gravitational memory effects related to @xmath0 theories with non - minimal curvature - matter coupling @xcite , or their equivalent scalar - tensor counterparts . this task could be potentially interesting due to non - trivial quantum effects that the non - trivial matter - coupling of the type @xmath150 can imply , with @xmath22 the trace of the energy momentum tensor .",
    "in addition , the evaporation picture of the pbh may be significantly altered .",
    "we hope to address this issue in the near future .",
