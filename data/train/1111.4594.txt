    "in particle cosmology , it is inevitable to consider the behavior of quantum fields ( or , in other words , particles ) in thermal bath because the universe was filled with hot plasma in the early epoch .",
    "the detailed thermal effects depend on how the particle of our interest , which we call @xmath0 , interacts with degrees of freedom in thermal bath .",
    "importantly , even if @xmath0 is so weakly interacting that it is not in thermal equilibrium , there can be non - negligible thermal effects on its dynamics .",
    "this is because the interaction rate of @xmath0 surrounded by thermal bath depends on the properties ( in particular , the dispersion relation ) of the degrees of freedom in thermal bath , which can of course be significantly affected by thermal effects .",
    "one important example of such a very weakly interacting particle is non - thermal dark matter which is produced by the decay of particles in thermal bath .",
    "although the existence of dark matter is strongly suggested by various cosmological observations  @xcite , particle - physics properties of dark matter , as well as its production mechanism in the early universe , have not been understood yet .",
    "various particle physics models including dark matter candidate have been proposed so far , like supersymmetric models , universal extra dimension models , and so on  @xcite . in the future , it is hoped that those models are tested by high energy experiments as well as by cosmological observations . in particular , the candidate of the dark matter particle may be discovered and studied by the lhc experiment as well as future linear colliders , based on which a large class of dark matter models are discriminated . for this program , precise theoretical calculation of the relic abundance of the dark matter candidate should be performed by using information about newly discovered particles @xcite .",
    "the present dark matter density is very accurately determined by the wmap collaboration as @xcite : @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the hubble constant in units of @xmath8 km / sec / mpc , so the dark matter abundance is now known with @xmath9 accuracy .",
    "thus , it is desirable to establish methods of calculating the dark matter density at the same level of accuracy . for this purpose ,",
    "detailed understanding of thermal effects on the dark matter production process is required .    in the present study , we pay particular attention to the case that dark matter particle is non - thermally produced by the decay of heavier particles in thermal bath .",
    "there are many examples of such non - thermally produced dark matter , like gravitino  @xcite , axino  @xcite , a singlet field @xcite , the right handed sneutrino  @xcite , and more generally , the recently proposed `` freeze - in '' particles  @xcite .",
    "in such a scenario , the relic density of dark matter is determined at the cosmic temperature comparable to the mass of decaying particle and is insensitive to the thermal history before that . in the previous studies ,",
    "the production rate of dark matter has been calculated by using the decay rates of particles estimated in vacuum .",
    "however , in the actual situation , the particles decay in the thermal bath , so the production rate taking account of the thermal effects should be properly used in the calculation of the dark matter density . as we will see , the thermal effects may significantly change the resultant abundance of dark matter .    in this paper",
    ", we raise the question how important the thermal effects are in the production process of non - thermal dark matter . to answer this question ,",
    "we first study the properties of boltzmann equation derived from the kadanoff - baym equations  @xcite under the assumption that the production of dark matter does not affect the thermal bath . in particular ,",
    "unless the dark matter production is almost kinematically blocked by thermal masses during the time when the production of dark matter is most effective , the full boltzmann equation can be reduced to a simplified form which has the same structure as the conventional boltzmann equation but constructed with `` thermal masses '' of particles in thermal bath .",
    "( as we will see , such a simplified boltzmann equation is obtained by taking the `` zero - width approximation '' of particles in thermal bath . )",
    "we evaluate the relic density of dark matter by solving ( i ) the full , ( ii ) zero - width approximated , and ( iii ) conventional boltzmann equations . comparing the three results ,",
    "we discuss how important the thermal effects are and when the zero - width approximation breaks down .",
    "we will see that the dark matter abundance may be reduced by @xmath10 compared with the result of calculation where the thermal effects are neglected .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "formalism ] , the relevant formulae to study the evolution of the number density of non - equilibrium particles are summarized . in particular ,",
    "properties of the boltzmann equation to be solved are discussed .",
    "then , in section [ sec : dm ] , we apply the formalism to the non - thermal dark matter production process .",
    "we numerically solve the boltzmann equation and discuss how important the thermal effects are .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to conclusions and discussion .",
    "first , let us introduce the formulae and equations relevant for our analysis .",
    "although many of them can be found in literature ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , we summarize the relevant equations to make this paper self - contained for the sake of readers .",
    "we assume that the thermal bath have a common temperature @xmath11 , which have a large degrees of freedom , and the back reaction to the thermal bath from the production of @xmath0 is negligible .    in this paper , we study the evolution of the number density of a scalar field @xmath0 coupled to scalar fields in thermal bath , which are denoted as @xmath12 .",
    "we introduce the interaction of the following form : @xmath13 ,    \\label{l_int}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is a coupling constant and , for the convenience of the following discussion , we introduced the operator @xmath15 .",

    "however , the extension of the formalism to the case that @xmath18 includes derivatives of scalar fields is straightforward .",
    "the evolution of the number density of @xmath0 in the early universe is governed by two effects : one is the production of @xmath0 due to the decay and scattering processes and the other is the cosmic expansion .",
    "we discuss these effects separately .    because of the weakness of the interaction",
    ", @xmath0 can be regarded as ( almost ) free particle , we assume that the self - interaction of @xmath0 is absent or weak enough to be neglected .",
    "we also assume that the thermal effects on the expectation value of @xmath0 is negligible , which is the case in the example in section [ sec : dm ] . and the number density operator is given by @xmath19 : ,    \\label{hatn_k}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the `` dot '' denotes the derivative with respect to time , @xmath20 is the normal ordering and @xmath21 in addition , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the field operator for @xmath0 and @xmath24 is the volume of the system ( where we have adopted box normalization ) . for the later convenience , the number density for each momentum eigenstate",

    "it is notable that , in the region where there is no kinematical suppression , the result of zero - width approximation agrees remarkably well with that of full calculation .",
    "thus , the effect of @xmath103 can be safely neglected in the calculation of the relic abundance of @xmath0 , unless the production channel is almost kinematically blocked at the epoch when the production of @xmath0 is most active . if the zero - width approximation can be adopted , the calculation of the production rate is extremely simplified . in the opposite case where @xmath0 is mostly produced at the epoch of kinematical suppression , production processes due to @xmath183 may not be negligible in the calculation of the relic abundance of @xmath0 .",
    "a typical example is given in the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : dy / dlnz ] .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : dy / dlnz ] , we can also see that , if we perform a naive calculation without properly taking account of the thermal effect , the production rate may significantly deviate from the correct value . in particular ,",
    "even at @xmath184 or @xmath185 , the discrepancy between the results of full and conventional calculations is sizable in some parameter region .",
    "this is because , at @xmath184 , the dominant production process of @xmath0 is @xmath130 contrary to the case of low enough temperature , and at @xmath185 , the phase space becomes smaller than that in the case of conventional calculation due to the thermal mass of @xmath125 .    in the non - thermal dark matter production due to the decay ,",
    "the dominant production occurs when @xmath186 ; for such a temperature , the actual value of @xmath154 may receive sizable thermal effects .",
    "thus , for the accurate calculation of the relic density of non - thermally produced dark matter , it is dangerous to neglect the thermal effects . in figs .",
    "[ fig : abundance03 ] and [ fig : abundance20 ] , we show the evolution of the yield variable @xmath149 . in the same figure , we also show the result of the naive calculation neglecting the thermal effects .",
    "as one can see , the evolution of @xmath149 changes once the thermal effects are taken into account , and the resultant value of @xmath149 is suppressed compared to the result obtained by neglecting the thermal effects . in particular , for the case of @xmath179 , which gives relatively large value of @xmath187 , significant amount of @xmath0 is produced even during the period of kinematical suppression and the resultant @xmath149 differs from the zero - width result .",
    "this is because the production channel is suppressed during the time @xmath188 , where the most effective production could occur if there were no thermal effects .",
    "therefore , the production due to the off - shell effects with @xmath189 becomes important .",
    "in such a case , the resultant value of @xmath149 does not agree with the result of zero - width approximation nor that of the conventional boltzmann equation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] , we plot the ratio of the yield variable calculated with and without thermal effects , @xmath190 as a function of @xmath137 and @xmath191 , using the zero - width approximation . in the present",
    "set up , the present number density of @xmath0 decreases by taking account of the thermal effects .",
    "as one can see , @xmath149 is more suppressed when @xmath137 becomes larger or when the mass of @xmath0 becomes closer to that of @xmath124 .     as a function of @xmath137 and @xmath191 , taking @xmath192 .",
    ", width=377 ]    before closing this section , we note here that there is another possible mechanism of enhancing the production rate . with the emission of a massless particle in the thermal bath from the initial or final state particles ( corresponding to @xmath124 or @xmath125 in the present setup )",
    ", the production rate of the non - thermal dark matter at @xmath193 may be affected , and may become larger by the factor of a few @xcite . in realistic models of non - thermally produced dark matter , the particles corresponding to @xmath124 and @xmath125 may couple to massless gauge bosons , which may enhance the production rate at @xmath193 . in the present model , however , there is no massless particle responsible for such an enhancement .",
    "in addition , for the calculation of the relic density of the non - thermally produced dark matter , such an effect may not be important because , as we have shown , the relic abundance of the non - thermally produced dark matter is determined at @xmath194 .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed the evolution of the number density of a particle @xmath0 which is coupled to thermal bath very weakly and hence is in non - equilibrium .",
    "we first solved the kadanoff - baym equations for the case that ( i ) the effects of @xmath0 on the thermal bath is negligible and ( ii ) the self interaction of @xmath0 is sufficiently weak .",
    "then , we derived boltzmann equation describing the evolution of the @xmath0 s number density for the case that ( iii ) the real part of the @xmath0 s self energy is ( almost ) unchanged by thermal effects .",
    "we then studied the properties of boltzmann equation , assuming that the degrees of freedom in the thermal bath are well described as the quasi - particles .",
    "in particular , in the situation that the widths of quasi - particles are negligible , the evolution of the number density is well described by the boltzmann equation in the familiar form , which contains the matrix elements , phase - space integrals , and distribution functions evaluated with the `` on - shell '' condition modified by the thermal effects .",
    "then , we have applied the formalism to the scenario in which dark matter is non - thermally produced from the decay of `` particles '' in thermal bath , regarding @xmath0 as the dark matter . in such a case , the above conditions ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii ) are satisfied , and the formalism we have studied can be safely applied .",
    "we calculated the number density of the non - thermally produced dark matter , taking account of the effects of thermal bath . because of the change of the dispersion relations of `` particles '' in thermal bath , the production rate of the dark matter may significantly change .",
    "in particular , in some cases , the decay process to produce @xmath0 , which is kinematically allowed in the vacuum , may be blocked because the particles in thermal bath acquire thermal masses , which changes the mass relation among parent and daughter quasi - particles .",
    "numerically , we found that , if the proper boltzmann equation with the thermal effects is used , the dark matter density may change by @xmath1 compared to the results of calculations neglecting the change of the dispersion relation of the `` particles '' in thermal bath .",
    "we have also studied the effect of the width in the spectral density of the quasi - particles in thermal bath , and found that the zero - width limit can be safely taken if the thermal blocking of the production of @xmath0 does not occur at the time when the production of @xmath0 is most effective .",
