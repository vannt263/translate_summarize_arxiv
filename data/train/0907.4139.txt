    "it is well known that different types of topological defects may have been formed in the early universe after planck time by a vacuum phase transition @xcite . depending on the topology of the vacuum manifold these are domain walls , strings , monopoles and textures . among them , cosmic strings and monopoles seem to be the best candidates to be observed .",
    "cosmic strings are linear topologically stable gravitational defects . the gravitational field produced by a cosmic string",
    "may be approximated by a planar angle deficit in the two - dimensional sub - space .",
    "the simplest theoretical model describing an idealized cosmic string , i.e. , straight and infinitely thin , is given by a delta - type distribution for the energy - momentum tensor along the linear defect .",
    "this object can also be described by classical field theory . by coupling",
    "the energy - momentum tensor associated with the maxwell - higgs system investigated by nielsen and olesen in @xcite with the einstein equations , garfinkle @xcite found static cylindrically symmetric solutions representing vortices , as in flat space - time , and shown that asymptotically the two dimensional spaces perpendicular to the vortices correspond to a plan minus a wedge .",
    "moreover , their core have a non - zero thickness with a non - vanishing magnetic fields inside . in additional publication ,",
    "linet @xcite obtained , as a limiting case , exact solutions for fields equations , corresponding to the spacetime produced by an idealized cosmic string , with the conical parameter being related with the energy per unity length of the vortex .",
    "though the recent observation data on the cosmic microwaves background have ruled out cosmic strings as the primary source for primordial density perturbation , they are still candidate for the generation of a number of interesting physical effects such as gamma ray burst @xcite , gravitational waves @xcite and high energy cosmic ray @xcite . moreover , in the framework of brane inflation @xcite-@xcite , cosmic strings have attracted renewed interest , partly because a variant of their formation mechanism is proposed .    although topological defects have been first considered in four - dimensional spacetimes , they have been analysed in higher - dimensional spacetimes in the context of braneworld . by this scenario",
    "the defects live in a @xmath8dimensions submanifold embedded in a @xmath9dimensional universe .",
    "the cosmic string case , corresponding to a two additional dimensions , has been analysed @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that the gravitational effects of global strings can be responsible for compactification from six to four spacetime dimensions , naturally producing the observed hierarchy between electroweak and gravitational forces .",
    "the analysis of quantum vacuum fluctuations associated with matter fields in curved spacetime are relevant in a semiclassical theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "the validity conditions under which the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the energy - momentum tensor can act as the source for a semiclassical gravitational field are discussed in @xcite . in this context , the vev of the energy - momentum tensor in the idealized cosmic string spacetime , have been considered in @xcite-@xcite and @xcite-@xcite , for scalar and fermionic fields , respectively .",
    "it has been shown that these quantities depend on the parameter which codify the conical structure of the two - geometry . moreover , considering the presence of magnetic flux running along the cosmic strings , there appears an additional contributions to the corresponding vacuum polarization effects associated with charged fields @xcite-@xcite . also by imposing boundary conditions on quantum fields , additional shifts in the vacuum expectation values of physical quantities , such as energy density and stress",
    "take place .",
    "this is the well - known casimir effects .",
    "the analysis of casimir effects in the idealized cosmic string space - time have been developed for a scalar @xcite , vector @xcite and fermionic fields @xcite , obeying boundary conditions on the cylindrical surfaces .    additionally to the contribution for the energy - momentum tensor associated with charged quantum fields ,",
    "the presence of a magnetic flux along the cosmic string induces vacuum current densities , as well .",
    "this phenomenon has been investigated for massless scalar field in @xcite and recently for massive one in @xcite . there",
    "the authors have shown that a vacuum induced azimuthal current densities , @xmath10 , take place if the ratio of the magnetic flux by the quantum one has a non - vanishing fractional part .",
    "so in a more general analysis about the influence of vacuum polarization effects on the semiclassical theory of gravity , induced currents produce additional contribution .",
    "this quantity is among the most important characteristics of the vacuum state .",
    "though the corresponding operator is local , due to the global nature of the vacuum , the vev of the current density describes the global properties of the bulk and carry important informations about the structure of the defect core and the magnetic flux .",
    "in addition to describe the physical structure of the quantum fields at a given point , the current density acts as source of the electromagnetic field in the maxwell s equations .",
    "it therefore plays an important role in modeling a self - consistent dynamics involving the electromagnetic fields .",
    "although the analysis of the vevs of the energy - momentum tensor associated with charged fermionic fields in a cosmic string spacetime having a magnetic flux line running along its core , has been developed by many authors ; as far as we know the investigation of the corresponding induced current densities has been restricted for a three - dimensional spacetime only in @xcite .",
    "so the objective of the paper is to extend this analysis as general as possible . adopting this line of investigation ,",
    "here we shall calculate the vacuum fluctuations of fermionic current densities in a @xmath1dimensional cosmic string spacetime , considering massless and massive fields . as we shall see these current densities depend crucially on the fractional part of the ratio of the magnetic flux by the quantum one .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec2 ] we briefly present some important results obtained in @xcite , associated with fermionic propagators in an arbitrary @xmath1dimensional cosmic string space - time , with @xmath11 , in the presence of a magnetic flux . although the main objective is to investigate induced currents in a higher - dimensional spaces , the formalism obtained allows us to develop similar analysis for a three - dimensional spacetime , as well .",
    "moreover , in this section we also present a closed expression for massive fermionic green function , expressed in terms of finite sum of macdonald function , @xmath12 , for specific values of the parameters which codify the presence of cosmic string and the fractional part of the ratio of the magnetic flux by the quantum one . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we calculate induced vacuum fermionic current densities for massless and massive fields . for massless fields ,",
    "we explicitly calculate all components of fermionic current densities for three and four dimensions and shown that only azimuthal components are different from zero . for massive fields and for specific conditions above mentioned , we calculate also all components of fermionic currents for @xmath13 .",
    "we shown that only for @xmath14 there appears a non - vanishing charge density . in section [ conc ] , we summarize the most important results obtained .",
    "the appendix [ a1 ] contains some details related with the analysis of radial and azimuthal current densities associated with massless fields in three - dimensional spacetime . in this paper",

    "in this section we briefly review the obtainment of the fermionic propagator derived in previous paper @xcite , in the @xmath1dimensional cosmic string spacetime in the presence of a magnetic flux running along its core . by using the generalized cylindrical coordinate with the cosmic string on the subspace defined by @xmath18 , being @xmath19",

    "the parameter @xmath24 , smaller than unity , codify the presence of the string and is given , in a four dimensional spacetime , in terms of the linear mass density of the string by @xmath25 .",
    "specifically for a six - dimensional space , @xmath26 , the geometry represented by ( [ cs0 ] ) corresponds to two dimensional conical surface transverse to a @xmath27-flat brane .    in order to calculate the fermionic propagator",
    ", we shall start the construction of the formalism admitting that the spacetime is six - dimensional .",
    "so we shall adopt for the @xmath28 dirac matrices , the representation below , constructed in terms of the @xmath29 ones @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 represents the @xmath29 identity matrix and @xmath33 and @xmath34 stand the ordinary unit vectors in cylindrical coordinates .",

    "although we have developed this formalism for a six - dimensional cosmic string space - time , we can adapt it for a three , four and five dimensional spaces .",
    "the reason resides in the representations adopted for the dirac matrices . for three dimensional space",
    "the corresponding dirac matrices are given in terms of @xmath60 pauli matrices ; and for a four and five dimensions , they are given in terms of the @xmath29 off - diagonal matrices of ( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "moreover , in ( [ d2b ] ) we should assume @xmath88 , which are related with the dimensions of the space considered .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to integrate over the variable @xmath89 in ( [ d2b ] ) and to express the euclidean bispinor in a closed form .",
    "in fact all the calculations of vacuum polarizations considering massive fields involve very complicated integrals . so in order to present more workable expressions , the massless limit of the corresponding results are adopted . here in this paper",
    ", we shall explicitly calculate the renormalized induced fermionic current for different dimensions of the space - time in closed expressions .",
    "so , in order to do that we shall consider two different limiting cases which allow us to reach this objective as shown in the following subsections .      in this subsection",
    "we provide the bispinor associated with a charged massless fermionic fields in an arbitrary dimension .",

    "davies and sahni @xcite , and souradeep and sahni @xcite , have shown that when the parameter @xmath24 is equal to the inverse of an integer number , i.e. , when @xmath108 , being @xmath109 an integer number , the corresponding green functions can be expressed in terms of @xmath109 images of the minkowski spacetime functions .",
    "recently the image method was also used in @xcite to provide closed expressions for massive scalar green functions for a higher - dimensional cosmic string space - time .",
    "the reason for the application of this method is because the order of the bessel functions which appear in the derivations of the green functions becomes an integer number .",
    "unfortunately , for the fermionic case , the order of the bessel function depends on the factor @xmath110 coming from the spin connection .",
    "however , if we consider a charged fermionic field in the presence of a magnetic flux running along the string , an additional factor will be present , the ratio of the magnetic flux by the quantum one , @xmath84 . for the case where @xmath84 is equal to @xmath110 and @xmath111 ,",
    "the order of the bessel function becomes an integer number , and in this case it is possible to use the image method to obtain the fermionic propagator in a closed form .",
    "although being a very special situation and somewhat unnatural , once that by a typical grand unified theory a realistic value for @xmath24 is very close the unity , the analysis of induced fermionic current under this circumstance may shed light on the qualitative behavior of this quantity for non - integer @xmath109 .    in order to derive a more compact expression for the euclidean bispinor in the above mentioned situation ,",
    "let us go back to the integrand of ( [ d2b ] ) , the heat kernel : @xmath112    defining @xmath113 with @xmath114 , the order of the modified bessel function becomes an integer number .",
    "for this case , with help of @xcite we can write : @xmath115 analogously , defining @xmath116 after some steps we obtain @xmath117 finally substituting @xmath118 and @xmath119 into the heat kernel and integrating on the variable @xmath89 we find with the help of @xcite , @xmath120 with @xmath121    now having derived the basic expressions to calculate the fermionic propagator , we leave for the next section the main objective of our paper , that is the calculations of induced fermionic current densities .",
    "the fermionic current density operator is an expression bilinear on the field . by using the general definition for fermionic propagator , @xmath122 with @xmath123",

    "we shall calculate the induced fermionic current densities for a massless fields , considering three and four dimensional cosmic string spacetimes .      from the general expression for fermionic propagator given by ( [ sf ] ) , for a three - dimensional spacetime",

    "we shall write the above function as the sum of two terms : @xmath136 where @xmath137 .",

    "we can affirm that there is no charge density induced by the magnetic flux for the physical situation investigated .    as to the radial current , @xmath157 , two distinct contributions are relevant in the product , @xmath158 .",

    "it is divergent in the coincidence limit , and this divergence coincides with the corresponding one given by the standard green function . renormalizing this contribution in the same way as we did before we get a finite and non - vanishing result .",
    "the second contribution is due to the other three terms .",
