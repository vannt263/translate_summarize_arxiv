    "as soon as the charge of the ion reaches @xmath11 two @xmath12-pairs are produced from the vacuum .",

    "these results were obtained without taking the screening of the coulomb potential into account .",
    "it was accounted for in @xcite where it was found that because of screening larger magnetic fields are needed for a particular nucleus to become critical .",
    "even more : according to @xcite nuclei with @xmath18 do not reach criticality because of screening .",
    "the approximation of pointlike nuclei ( which is valid when the landau radius is considerably larger than the size of the nucleus ) was used in @xcite .",
    "a nucleus with @xmath19 becomes critical when the magnetic field is so large that the landau radius equals the size of the nucleus .",
    "it was noted in @xcite that the diminishing of the coulomb potential due to the finite radius of the nucleus should push the value of the ground energy level up , and it was expected that this phenomenon will prevent ions with @xmath20 from reaching criticality . in sec .",
    "[ sec : finsizez ] we present quantitative consideration on the influence of the finiteness of nucleus size on the dependence of @xmath13 on the value of the external magnetic field @xmath21 .",

    "@xcite the atomic nucleus was considered as an infinitely heavy source of the coulomb field .",
    "because of the finiteness of the mass of the nucleus its motion in the magnetic field should be taken into account and one should consider the two body ( electron and nucleus ) problem in the presence of a homogeneous magnetic field .",
    "this consideration was made in @xcite . according to the results obtained in @xcite hydrogen atomic levels",
    "get increased by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the projection of the relative angular momentum on the direction of the external magnetic field and @xmath25 is the proton mass .",

    "[ sec : finmass ] .",
    "the finiteness of the nucleus mass also leads to a nonzero hyperfine interaction between the spins of the proton and the electron .",

    "the finite size of the nucleus makes the coulomb potential less singular at small distances , pushing up the electron levels .",
    "however the shape of potential at distances much smaller than the bohr radius @xmath26 is not very important for the values of the electron energies .",
    "the effect is the largest for @xmath27 levels , where the relative shift of energies goes like @xmath28 where @xmath29 is nucleus radius ( in case of muonic atoms this shift is more important since it is enhanced by @xmath30 ) .",
    "strong magnetic fields make the coulomb problem essentially one - dimensional . and",
    "in one space dimension a @xmath31 potential leads to a spectrum unbounded from below : the ground state energy equals minus infinity .",
    "the divergence of the potential at @xmath32 is regulated by the landau radius @xmath33 : @xmath34 .",
    "it follows from this consideration that the behaviour of the potential at small distances determines the energy of the ground state . in this section",
    "we will find how accounting for the finite size of the nucleus modifies its electric potential .",
    "an analytic formula for the coulomb potential of a pointlike charge along the @xmath35 axis screened by a magnetic field was derived in @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath35 is the coordinate along the magnetic field , @xmath37 , and the charge is located at the point @xmath38 .",
    "the sum of the first two terms , @xmath39 , does not vary at distances @xmath40 , and the smearing of the pointlike charge along the @xmath35 axis within the domain with size @xmath41 does not affect it . at the same time",
    "the last term , @xmath42 , becomes very sensitive to the charge distribution for @xmath43 .",
    "the potential in the plane transverse to the magnetic field ( @xmath38 ) was found in @xcite for @xmath44 , @xmath45 : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the coordinate in the transverse plane .",

    "the potential is sensitive to the charge distribution .",
    "the important question is whether the long range part of the potential along the @xmath35 axis , @xmath39 , is also affected by the smearing of the pointlike charge in the transverse plane .    at @xmath49",
    "the potential @xmath50 has the following behaviour @xcite : @xmath51 the main contribution from the terms @xmath39 to the value of the electron energy comes from large distances , @xmath52 . to significantly change this contribution",
    "the potential ( [ eq:0b ] ) should noticeably differ from the coulomb potential at distances @xmath53 : @xmath54 we are not going to consider here such strong fields ; so this effect is neglected in what follows .",
    "thus , there are two parts in the potential : the first one , @xmath39 , does not depend on the charge distribution inside the nucleus and the second one , originating from @xmath55 ( where @xmath56 ) , is determined by the charge distribution .",
    "another issue is the modification of the proton shape in a superstrong magnetic fields which would lead to the variation of atomic energies .",
    "as soon as the landau radius of the electron becomes close to the proton radius the same happens with the landau radius of the proton .",
    "when the magnetic field further grows one could expect that the size of the proton in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field shrinks .",
    "but the proton is not an elementary particle and for @xmath57 the valence and sea quarks will be oscillating inside domains with size of the order of @xmath33 which are not necessarily situated at @xmath58 . the distribution of these rotating quarks inside the nucleus will be defined by strong interactions , so there is no reason to think that the nucleus in the transverse plane is squeezed down to the size of @xmath33 .",
    "what is really happening to the proton shape in such a strong magnetic field is a subject for a separate study , while here we will neglect the possible shrinking of the nucleus in the magnetic field .    with the account of the specific features discussed above the potential along the @xmath35 axis at @xmath59 has the following form : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is determined by the charge distribution inside the nucleus .",
    "since the charge distribution inside the nucleus in such strong magnetic field is not known , we will consider three following cases :    1 .",
    " the potential outside the nucleus is equal to that of a pointlike charge and inside the nucleus it is constant and equals the value of the potential at the surface .",
    "this case corresponds to @xmath62 : @xmath63 2 .   ",
    "taking into account that the last term @xmath64 in the expression ( [ eq:1 ] ) satisfies the yukawa equation @xmath65 we obtain : @xmath66 3 .",
    " the potential can be easily found from the formula for a charged sphere : @xmath67",
    "the following equation for the hydrogen atomic energies on which the lowest landau level ( lll ) with @xmath68 splits was obtained in @xcite by solving the schrdinger equation ( and it was checked in @xcite that the relativistic corrections can be neglected as far as the binding energy is much smaller than the electron mass ) : @xmath69 where the energies of the atomic states are determined by @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 is the bohr radius , @xmath73 is the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function , and @xmath74 is the euler s constant .",

    "@xmath240 the spin - spin interaction considerably grows : @xmath241    it follows that at @xmath242 the spin - spin interaction energy becomes of the order of the freezing energy of the hydrogen ground level @xmath243 , and if a linear growth of @xmath244 with @xmath21 would take place for @xmath245 it would determine the value of the ground state atomic energy @xmath246 .",
    "however just at @xmath247 the landau radius @xmath33 approaches the proton charge radius and a power formfactor suppression of @xmath244 occurs preventing it from growing further .",
    "the energy of the spin - spin interaction in heavy hydrogenlike ions is enhanced by a factor @xmath9 which originates from the @xmath248 factor in the expression for @xmath249 . since protons and neutrons from completely filled nuclei shells",
    "do not contribute to the magnetic moment of the nucleus , for @xmath250 the extra term in the energy is considerably smaller than the value of the electron mass and the consideration of nuclei criticality in strong @xmath21 does not change substantially .",
    "( one should also take into account that the formfactor suppression in heavy ions starts at smaller @xmath21 )",
    ".    it would be very interesting to understand to which shift of the energy of the positronium ground state in a superstrong magnetic field the spin - spin interaction of the electron and positron leads . in the absence of external magnetic field , due to this interaction ,",
    "the ground state of the parapositronium is lighter than the ground state of the ortopositronium @xcite : @xmath251    the behaviour of the positronium energy levels in an external magnetic field has several specific features @xcite , and in fields @xmath252 the state with lower energy is a mixture of ortopositronium and parapositronium ground states in which the electron spin is oriented in the direction opposite to the magnetic field , while the spin of the positron is directed along @xmath21 .",
    "its energy shift due to the spin - spin interaction is of the order of : @xmath253 and for @xmath254 the ground state positronium energy could become lower than @xmath255 which should lead to the production of @xmath12 pairs from the vacuum ( see @xcite as well )",
    ".    however the spin - spin interaction hamiltonian is determined as a nonrelativistic expansion of the @xmath12 scattering amplitude , the expansion parameter being @xmath256 @xcite . in the case of a strong external magnetic field @xmath257 , and for @xmath258",
    "the correctness of the formulae ( [ eq:501 ] ) and ( [ eq:503 ] ) is doubtful .",
    "let us remind that the anomalous electron magnetic moment leads to a linear growing with @xmath21 of correction to the lowest landau level energy .",
    "however this behaviour is valid only for @xmath259 , while for @xmath258 the strong linear dependence on @xmath21 is replaced by a weak double logarithmic one ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .    concluding this section let us state that the behaviour of the spin - spin interaction in atoms and positronium at strong external magnetic fields @xmath258 deserves further study .",
    "in a magnetic field @xmath45 the potential of a pointlike charge becomes screened due to large radiative corrections .",
    "the screened potential has a coulomb behaviour along the @xmath35 axis at distances @xmath260 and @xmath261 and these regions define the ground state atomic energy . distributing the pointlike charge within a domain of the size of the nuclear radius @xmath29 leads to a less singular behaviour of the potential at distances @xmath134 .",
    "when @xmath149 approaches @xmath150 the ground state energy approaches the limiting value . for hydrogen the limiting value of @xmath139 which defines the ground state energy @xmath262 is equal to @xmath263 instead of @xmath264 obtained in @xcite for a pointlike charge , and @xmath265 instead of @xmath266 .",
    "the same phenomenon of going up of the ground energy level is obtained numerically in the relativistic domain for hydrogen - like ions .",
    "it leads to a nontrivial dependence of the critical nucleus charge on the magnetic field : the nuclei with @xmath194 never become critical while the ions with @xmath267 are critical only within a finite range of magnetic fields . at @xmath268 a `` second '' freezing",
    "energy reaches the lower continuum and the nuclei with @xmath200 are critical at any @xmath21 .",
