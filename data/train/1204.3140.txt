    "most of the sightlines follow the ccm law , but there are a number of lines of sight for which the ccm law is not good enough @xcite .",
    "certain regions show weak broad bump and strong fuv rise @xcite that closely resemble extinction in small magellanic cloud ( smc ) .",
    "these anomalous sightlines are referred to as non - ccm sightlines @xcite and include hd 210121 , hd 204827 , hd 29647 and hd 62542 .",
    "the steep fuv rise in extinction is interpreted as the manifestation of high abundance of very small grains @xcite .",
    "these sightlines may have been exposed to shocks or strong uv radiation that disrupt large grains resulting in a size distribution favoring small grains @xcite .",
    "small @xmath2 for these objects point to smaller particles but , contrary to observation , will simultaneously lead to stronger @xmath0 bump @xcite .",
    "all the non - ccm sightlines contain a b type young star as background to dense clouds , e.g. hd 210121 is a high latitude b3 v star and hd 204827 is a b0 v star , and are background to dense clouds rich in carbon and its molecules @xcite .",
    "several attempts to model the non - ccm extinction have been made that include considering different grain compositions @xcite , different size distributions @xcite or both @xcite .",

    "considering clusters of grains @xcite show that for hd 204827 the match is improved in the fuv but gets poor in the bump region .",
    "simultaneous matching of the bump and fuv rise is difficult .",

    "@xcite and @xcite show good fits using three component silicate , graphite and amorphous carbon ( amc ) models and applying maximum entropy method ( mem ) .",
    "these models use very low fraction of graphite and in a very narrow size range while the upper size cut - off for amc is ( @xmath5 ) , about 10 times larger . in the strong uv flux regions of the non - ccm sightlines graphite being more rugged to wear and",

    "observations along hd 29647 and hd 62542 @xcite show an opposite trend i.e. a shift towards shorter wavelength that is accompanied by steep fuv rise .",
    "nanodiamond ( nd ) extinction shows steep rise in fuv beyond @xmath7 @xcite and considering nd as core inside graphite or amc mantle lowers the bump and shifts the @xmath8 peak blue - ward @xcite .",
    "there is profile similarity of extinction incorporating nds inside carbonaceous material with observations along non - ccm sightlines .",
    "using nd core inside graphite mantle gives good match with the average galactic extinction particularly in the fuv @xcite .",

    "the strong radiation field in non - ccm objects , which are generally young b type objects with carbon rich atmospheres , may lead to grain processing and formation of core - mantle type structures , with nd as core in graphite or amc mantle .",
    "for the same reason large amc grains , as considered by @xcite in extinction models , are likely to be destroyed and easily re - cycled and re - formed @xcite . considering nd in carbonaceous core smoothens the extinction peak / plateau @xmath101400  @xcite and also explains the rare detection of features likely in pure nd .    in the present work core - mantle",

    "so the ratio of radii decreases continuously for graphite radii larger than 0.010 @xmath9 .",

    "replacing pure graphite component with nd - graphite core - mantle component ( row 2 ) improves the fitting in all the cases except in hd 204827 . considering a three component model by addition of nd - amc core - mantle component along with pure graphite and silicate components ( row 3 ) gives a much better match for all the objects . using only amc as the third component improves fitting @xcite but the fuv region",

    "of the three parts of parametrization of @xcite the linear part is provided by silicates , drude fit is due to graphite and nd - amc addresses the fuv rise .",
    "this reduces considerably the requirement of silicates .",
    "for example in the case of hd 210121 the silicate fraction goes down from 0.45 in the two component model to 0.18 in the model with nd - amc as third component .",

    "most extinction models imply near solar or higher elemental abundances @xcite .",
    "if ism abundances are considered to be subsolar it becomes difficult to account for the overall extinction @xcite .",
    "though the elemental abundances and dust depletion data are likely to be constrained by observational and star formation effects @xcite , incorporation of nds comforts the need of silicates and the carbon budget is also not affected as very small fraction in diamond form is needed .",

    "supernova annealing of carbonaceous material can lead to nd formation @xcite .",
    "nd - amc component is a viable dust component for this sightline and a good fit to the observational values is obtained .",
    "the silicate fraction is drastically reduced from 0.65 to 0.02 .",
    "hd 29647 is a b7 v type highly reddened star in the taurus dark cloud @xcite .",
    "it has a very weak 217.5 @xmath29 bump and steep fuv rise . in this region a four component model is needed that includes nd - graphite along with nd - amc core mantle components , with a larger upper size cut - off ( table  [ tbl-1 ] , row 4 ) .",

    "the proximity of hd 29647 to tmc-1 that is sampled along the line of sight @xcite can induce complex structural changes in carbonaceous grains and both the core - mantle components could be present .",
    "the best fit is obtained with silicate fraction going to zero .",

    "extinction along hd 29647 and hd 62542 resemble extinction along smc @xcite .",
    "it was considered that silicon is rather undepleted in smc @xcite but based on the kramers - kronig dispersion relation @xcite show that silicates are important contributors to extinction in smc .",
    "it may be interesting to consider nd component in the extinction models for smc .",

    "the lower size limit for silicate grains is taken to be @xmath32 but the possibility of ultrasmall silicates ( @xmath33 ) can not be ruled out @xcite .",
    "ultrasmall silicates would increase the fuv excess without affecting the bump region . in the present models",
    "the required fuv excess is being taken care of by the nd component that simultaneously weakens and broadens the bump , which is required along these sightlines . comparing the reported 10 objects it is further seen that the nd - graphite component was required only in hd 29647 .",
    "this object is very close behind the taurus cloud actively processing the grains thus consistent with the assumption that nd - graphite component results from secondary processing and in harsher environments .",
    "the material in protoplanetary disks inherited from the ism will contain nd mainly as nd - amc component .",
    "the amc mantle in the inner regions can be shredded by heating , shocks or grain shattering .",
    "this may leave the nd with dangling h atoms that can be responsible for the c  h stretch emission features from the inner regions @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that along all non - ccm sightlines and sightlines with steep fuv extinction there is a young b type star processing the foreground ism .",

    "the nearby b type star hd 283800 is not sampling the cloud ( @xcite , fig.1 ) and shows normal extinction .",
    "the orion molecular cloud ngc 1976 has e.g. a young o type star hd 37022 in its foreground @xcite so the light reaching us does not sample / process the cloud and does not exhibit non - ccm extinction .",
    "young hot objects in the vicinity of dense clouds induce grain processing and in carbonaceous regions can give rise to growth and transformations of different carbon metamorphs .",
    "experimental , theoretical and observational studies point to the possibility of carbon in diamond form in the ism . besides enhanced far - uv extinction @xcite , luminescence from diamond nano - crystals",
