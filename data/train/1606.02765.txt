    "the mammalian hippocampus plays a major role in spatial cognition , spatial learning and spatial memory by producing an internalized representation of space  a cognitive map of the environment @xcite .",
    "several key observations shed light on the neuronal computations responsible for implementing such a map .",
    "the first observation is that the spiking activity of the principal cells in the hippocampus is spatially tuned . in rats , these neurons ,",
    "called place cells , fire only in restricted locations  their respective place fields @xcite .",
    "as demonstrated in many studies , this simple principle allows decoding the animal s ongoing trajectory @xcite , its past navigational experience @xcite , and even its future planned routs @xcite from the place cell s spiking activity .",
    "the second observation is that the spatial layout of the place fields  the place field map  is `` flexible '' : as the environment is deformed , the place fields shift and change their shapes , while preserving most of their mutual overlaps , adjacency and containment relationships @xcite .",
    "thus , the sequential order of place cells ( co)activity induced by the animal s moves through morphing environment remains invariant within a certain range of geometric transformations @xcite .",
    "this implies that the place cells spiking encodes a coarse framework of qualitative spatiotemporal relationships , i.e. , that the hippocampal map is topological in nature , more similar to a schematic subway map than to a topographical city map @xcite .",
    "the third observation concerns the synaptic architecture of the ( para)hippocampal network : it is believed that groups of place cells that demonstrate repetitive coactivity form functionally interconnected `` assemblies , '' which together drive their respective `` reader - classifier '' or `` readout '' neurons in the downstream networks @xcite .",
    "the activity of a readout neuron actualizes the qualitative relationships between the regions encoded by the individual place cells , thus defining the type of spatial connectivity information encoded in the hippocampal map @xcite .",
    "a given cell assembly network architecture appears as a result of spatial learning , i.e. , it emerges from place cell coactivities produced during an animal s navigation through a particular place field map , via a `` fire - together - wire - together '' plasticity mechanism @xcite .",
    "however , a principal property of the cell assemblies is that they may not only form , but also or disband as a result of a depression of synapses caused by reduction or cessation of spiking activity over a sufficiently long timespan @xcite .",
    "some of the disbanded cell assemblies may later reappear during a subsequent period of coactivity , then disappear again , and so forth .",
    "electrophysiological studies suggest that the lifetime of the cell assemblies ranges between minutes @xcite to hundreds of milliseconds @xcite .",
    "in contrast , spatial memories in rats can last much longer @xcite , raising the question : how can a large - scale spatial representation of the environment be stable if the neuronal stratum that computes this representation changes on a much faster timescale ?",
    "the hypothesis that the hippocampus encodes a topological map of the environment allows this question to be addressed computationally .",
    "below , we propose a phenomenological model of a transient hippocampal network and use methods of algebraic topology to demonstrate that a large - scale topological representation of the environment encoded by this network may remain stable despite the transience of neuronal connections .",
    "in @xcite , we proposed a computational approach to integrating the information provided by the individual place cells into a large - scale topological representation of the environment , based on several remarkable parallels between the elements of hippocampal physiology and certain notions of algebraic topology .",
    "there , we regarded a particular collection of coactive place cells @xmath0 , @xmath1 , ... , @xmath2 as an abstract `` coactivity simplex '' @xmath3 $ ] , which may be visualized ( for @xmath4 ) or apprehended ( for @xmath5 ) as an @xmath6-dimensional polyhedron @xcite . as a result",
    ", the pool of coactivities is represented by a simplicial `` coactivity '' complex @xmath7 , which provides a link between the cellular and the net systemic level of the information processing . just like simplexes ,",
    "the individual cell groups provide local information about the environment , but together , as a neuronal ensemble , they represent space as whole  as the simplicial complex .",
    "numerical experiments @xcite backed up by a remarkable theorem due to p. alexandrov @xcite and e. ech s @xcite point out that @xmath7 correctly represents the topological structure of the rat s environment and may serve as a schematic model of the hippocampal map @xcite . for example , the paths traveled by the rat are represented by the `` simplicial paths''chains of simplexes in @xmath7 that capture certain qualitative properties of their physical counterparts ( see @xcite and fig .",

    ", producing a faithful representation of the environment from place cell coactivity requires learning . in the model ,",
    "this process is represented by the dynamics of the coactivity complex s formation . at every moment of time",
    ", the coactivity complex represents only those place cell combinations that have exhibited ( co)activity . as the animal begins to explore the environment , the newly emerging coactivity complex is small , fragmented and contains many holes , most of which do not correspond to physical obstacles or to the regions that have not yet been visited by the animal .",
    "these `` spurious '' structures tend to disappear as the pool of place cell coactivities accumulates .",

    "moreover , the coincidence detection coactivity complexes can be viewed as a specific case of the input integration coactivity complexes : as the integration period shrinks and approaches the coactivity period @xmath27 , the input integration coactivity complex @xmath26 reduces to the coincidence complex @xmath26 .",

    "fundamentally , the mechanism of producing the hippocampal map depends on two key constituents : on the timing of the action potentials produced by the place cells and by the way in which the spiking information is processed by the downstream networks . a key determinant for the latter is the synaptic architecture of the cell assembly network , which changes constantly due to various forms of synaptic and structural plasticity : place cell assemblies may emerge in cell groups that exhibit frequent coactivity or disband due to lack thereof .",
    "the latter phenomenon is particularly significant : since the hippocampal network is believed to be one of the principal memory substrates , frequent recycling of synaptic connections may compromise the integrity of its net function . for example",
    ", the existence of many - to - one projections from the ca3 to the ca1 region of the hippocampus suggests that the ca1 cells may serve as the readout neurons for the assemblies formed by the ca3 place cells @xcite .",
    "electrophysiological studies suggest that the recurrent connections within ca3 and the ca3-ca1 connections rapidly renew during the learning process and subsequent navigation @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also well known that lesioning these connections disrupts the animal s performance in spatial @xcite and nonspatial @xcite learning tasks , which suggests that an exceedingly rapid recycling of functional cell groups may impair the net outcome of the hippocampal network , which is the hippocampal spatial map @xcite .",
    "the proposed model allows investigating whether a plastic , dynamically rewiring network of place cell assemblies can sustain a stable topological representation of the environment .",
    "the results suggest that if the intervals between consecutive appearance and disappearance of the cell assemblies are short , the hippocampal map exhibits strong topological fluctuations .",
    "however , if the cell assemblies rewire sufficiently slowly , the information encoded in the hippocampal map remains stable despite the connectivity transience in its neuronal substrate .",
    "thus , the plasticity of neuronal connections , which is ultimately responsible for the network s ability to incorporate new information @xcite , does not necessarily degrade the information that is already stored in the network .",
