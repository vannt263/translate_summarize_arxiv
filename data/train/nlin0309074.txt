    "during the last years , due to fast progress in the fabrication of microresonators , organic and inorganic quantum wells etc . , great interest has been attracted to investigation of electromagnetic properties of these new objects , including propagation of nonlinear pulses in such structures ( see , e.g. , @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "for example , in @xcite propagation of nonlinear pulses along a quantum well imbedded in a microresonator was studied for two types of nonlinearities  kerr - like nonlinearity applied to envelopes of long enough pulses , and self - induced transparency ( sit ) nonlinearity applied to short and intense pulses with frequency close the two - level resonance . in this study ,",
    "the authors have chosen such conditions of propagation that one can neglect the polariton effect of formation of a gap in the dispersion law of an electromagnetic wave coupled with the wave of polarization in a medium .",
    "then the problem of pulse propagation can be reduced to either nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation , or sine - gordon equation with well - known soliton solutions .",
    "however , the region of frequencies in vicinity of the polariton gap is very important , because some properties of the structures under consideration show up in this region only .",
    "one should note that related problems were already studied long time ago in the theory on nonlinear pulse propagation through a medium in vicinity of exciton resonances . in papers",
    "@xcite , the polariton sit pulses were found , but later there was made a statement @xcite that polariton effect prevents the existence of the sit pulses .",
    "this contradiction was clarified in refs .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that polariton solitons do exist due to subtle balance of small effects , and therefore these solutions may easily be overlooked if too rude approximation is made in the evolution equations .",
    "later the authors of @xcite confirmed in general this result and described some additional remarkable properties of the polariton sit pulses in the vicinity of polariton gap beyond the perturbation theory .",
    "similar problems have also been studied for the case of kerr nonlinearity ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , the approximations used were not justified well enough , and some properties of polariton solitons remained unclear . in paper @xcite , for long pulses and frequency of the carrier wave far enough from the polariton gap ,",
    "the governing equations were reduced to the perturbed nls equation for the envelope and corresponding soliton solutions are described .",
    "a closely related problem , namely a pulse propagation in kerr - nonlinear medium with singular dispersion relation was studied in @xcite where bright and dark solitary wave solutions were found in vicinity of linear resonance .    in this paper",
    "we perform a thorough investigation of polariton solitons for the case of kerr nonlinearity following the method developed by akimoto and ikeda @xcite and show the existence of localized solutions both inside and outside the polariton gap .",
    "we start with the standard equations of the classical theory of electromagnetic waves propagating through an isotropic medium ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , @xmath0 @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the background dielectric constant , and @xmath3 these equations describe interaction of the electromagnetic field @xmath4 and the polarization wave @xmath5 due to the kerr - like nonlinearity ( measured by the parameter @xmath6 ) . here",
    "we ignore the effect of damping .",
