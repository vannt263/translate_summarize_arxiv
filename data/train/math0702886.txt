    "in this article we continue our mathematical analysis of a model for the degradation of host tissue by extracellular bacteria .",
    "this model was introduced in @xcite and consists of a reaction - diffusion equation coupled with an ordinary differential equation . in @xcite",
    "we proved the existence of solutions to the time - dependent problem and the convergence to a limit problem in the ` large - degradation - rate ' limit .",
    "here we turn to the question of existence and behaviour of travelling - wave solutions .",
    "there is an increasing interest in models which support the understanding of bacterial infections , and we refer to @xcite and @xcite for further background and references .",
    "this paper is in effect concerned with the specific issue of how rapidly a bacterial infection in , for example , a burn wound may invade the underlying tissue ( with dire potential consequences for the patient , notably mortality due to septicemia ) . for the type of model with which we are concerned here",
    ", the relevant invasion speed is expected to be governed by the corresponding travelling - wave problem .",
    "typically , the smallest possible wave - speed is realized by a large class of solutions .",
    "accordingly determining the minimal speed of travelling waves becomes a central question ( with obvious implications for the amount of time available for medical treatment , for instance ) .    in a dimensionless form , the model in @xcite",
    "is given by the equations @xmath0 where @xmath1 describes the concentration of degradative enzymes , @xmath2 the volume fraction of healthy tissue and @xmath3 are positive constants .",
    "the key parameter here is the _ degradation - rate _",
    "@xmath4 , which is very large in practice .",
    "equations , are considered in a time - space cylinder , with the upper half space of @xmath5 as the spatial domain . finally , the system is complemented by initial conditions for @xmath1 and @xmath6 , a neumann condition on the lateral boundary for @xmath1 and a decay condition for @xmath1 and @xmath6 in the far field . in @xcite",
    "we gave a precise mathematical formulation and proved the existence and uniqueness of solutions to a slightly more general system , including the possibility of a diffusion term in .",
    "one noteworthy aspect of , is the convergence of solutions to the solution of a stefan - like free boundary problem as the degradation rate @xmath4 tends to infinity .",
    "this _ large - degradation - rate limit _ was identified by a formal asymptotic analysis in @xcite and was proved in @xcite .",
    "reaction - diffusion systems of the general form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is vector - valued , @xmath9 is a given nonlinearity and @xmath10 is a diagonal positive - semi - definite matrix , appear in a lot of different scientific areas .",
    "one - dimensional travelling waves are solutions on @xmath11 of the special form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is called the speed and @xmath14 the profile of this travelling wave .",
    "the question of existence and behaviour of travelling waves is of enormous interest in many of the applications and pertinent results for the vector case @xmath15 remain restricted to rather specific systems .",
    "the system , has , as we will see in remark [ rem : mono ] , one stable equilibrium in @xmath16 and one unstable equilibrium in @xmath17 and therefore belongs to the class of monostable systems .",
    "scalar monostable equations @xmath18 where @xmath19 are well - studied , especially the famous fisher equation , that is with @xmath20 , introduced in @xcite .",
    "the rigorous analysis of equations of this type also started in the 1930s with the work of kolmogorov , petrovskii and piskunov @xcite . under an extra assumption on @xmath21",
    "they proved the existence of travelling waves for all speeds @xmath22 , where @xmath23 can be found explicitly in terms of @xmath21 by a linearisation about @xmath24 ( corresponding to a degenerate node in the travelling - wave phase plane ) .",
    "moreover , they proved that the solutions to with initial data decaying sufficiently fast propagate with speed @xmath23 . for more general monostable @xmath21",
    "the propagation speed was found to be either equal to or larger than @xmath23 and therefore one distinguishes between a _ linear _ or _ nonlinear _ selection of the propagation speed ( the terminology _ pulled _ and _ pushed _ fronts , respectively , having an equivalent meaning ) .",
    "aronson and weinberger @xcite ( see also hadeler and rothe @xcite and @xcite for other pioneering work on such matters and @xcite for a recent review ) proved that for general monostable @xmath21 , in both the linear and the nonlinear selection case , the propagation speed for solutions with initial data decaying sufficiently fast is given by the minimal speed of travelling waves .",
    "they showed that monotonic travelling waves exist for all speeds @xmath25 and none for @xmath26 , where @xmath27 ; solutions of with sufficiently rapidly decaying initial data propagate with speed @xmath28 .",
    "for the nonlinear selection cases , @xmath29 , rothe @xcite and roquejoffre @xcite proved that , if the initial data decays sufficiently rapidly , the large - time solutions to not only propagate with speed @xmath28 but also approach the profile of a travelling wave with minimal speed .",
    "whereas the connection between large - time behaviour and existence of travelling waves for monostable equations is satisfactorily resolved , the distinction between nonlinear or linear selection is still a challenging question , see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "only a few rigorous results for general monostable nonlinearities are available . in @xcite a variational characterisation of travelling waves and a concrete criterion for whether linear or nonlinear selection occurs for a given equation was derived .",
    "even fewer general analytical results are available for monostable _ systems_. an existence theorem for travelling waves was proved in @xcite for monotone monostable systems , which are systems of the form in which the jacobian matrix @xmath30 has only nonnegative off - diagonal elements .",
    "results on the existence of travelling waves and the long time behaviour of for monostable gradient systems , that is for @xmath31 and nonlinearities @xmath32 with @xmath33 , were given in @xcite . to the best of our knowledge",
    "there are no more general results on the question of whether linear or nonlinear selection will occur .    in this article",
    "we prove that for all @xmath3 there exist monotone travelling waves for the system , for all speeds @xmath25 and no speeds @xmath34 .",
    "the minimal speed @xmath28 in general depends on the parameters @xmath3 .",
    "we prove that for all @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is explicitly given in terms of @xmath37 , the minimal speed is larger than the value @xmath38 obtained from a linearisation at the unstable equilibrium .",
    "surprisingly enough , for @xmath35 the minimal speed of travelling waves is identical to the minimal speed of travelling waves for the stefan - like limit problem that was formulated in @xcite .",
    "our analysis is based on two main facts .",
    "one is the monotone structure of the system , which makes possible the use of comparison principles for the parabolic problem .",
    "the second is a remarkable reduction in order of the travelling - wave equations that occurs when @xmath13 is given by the minimal speed @xmath39 of travelling waves of the large - degradation limit .",
    "we obtain the existence of travelling waves with speed @xmath39 for , .",
    "finally , a comparison argument allows us to prove that nonlinear selection occurs for sufficiently large values of @xmath4 , the minimal speed in this regime being identical to @xmath39 .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec - exist ]",
    "we prove the existence of travelling waves for the reaction - diffusion system , . in section [ sec - limit ]",

    "we return to the reaction - diffusion system and investigate the selection of the minimal speed .",
    "section [ sec - conv ] deals with the convergence of travelling waves for the reaction - diffusion system to travelling waves of the stefan - like free boundary problem as the reaction rate @xmath4 approaches infinity .",
    "finally , we give some conclusions and remarks on open problems in section [ sec - concl ] .",
    "in this section we prove the existence of monotone travelling waves .",
    "first we fix some notation and make some remarks .",
    "[ rem : mono ] a system of the general form is called _ monotone _",

    "further , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the only stationary points of , and we obtain @xmath43 with one positive and one negative eigenvalue , and @xmath44 with two negative eigenvalues .",
