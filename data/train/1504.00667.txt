    "the standard model of cosmological structure formation is based upon the notion that the gravitational landscape is dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) , which initially collapses on small scales and grows hierarchically to larger scales through the continued merger and accretion of smaller objects .",
    "many of the accreting systems survive to the present epoch as independent entities within their host , giving rise to a system of nested substructure within the largest objects to have formed today . these surviving remnants present a unique opportunity to study the seeds of galaxy formation and the chance to probe the nature of dark matter on small scales .",
    "accomplishing these goals requires the development of an accurate and predictive theory for the evolution of substructure .",
    "this remains a difficult task and a fundamental problem in the burgeoning area of near field cosmology . even without taking into account the complicating role played by dissipative effects associated with , e.g. , star formation and feedback",
    ", one must still contend with reconciling the stochasticity in the primordial fluctuations that seed the subsructure in any given object , on the one hand , and the highly nonlinear gravitational dynamics associated with tidal disruption and dynamical friction , on the other hand . as is often the case , efforts to tackle this problem generally fall into one of two categories .",
    "first are direct numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which attempt to solve the problem _ ab initio _ from cosmological initial conditions zoomed on a single host .",
    "this class of approaches suffers from small number statistics , both in the number of individual objects simulated and in the range of underlying background cosmologies ( warm dark matter , self - interacting dark matter , broken scale invariance , etc . ) .",
    "in addition , while simulations have begun to converge on accurate solutions for individual systems in a @xmath2cdm universe composed only of collisionless dark matter , star formation and feedback must still be treated using heuristic sub - grid approaches calibrated with empirical data , blurring the line between theory and observation and complicating the interpretation of simulations .",
    "the second class involves semi - analytical galaxy formation models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which have a long history in cosmology , and have begun to be successfully applied to the local universe .",
    "the standard approach is to generate a mass accretion history using the excursion set formalism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) followed by an integration of individual accreting orbits from the moment of infall to the present day .",
    "orbital parameters at infall are drawn from probability distributions motivated by numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the time integration contains prescriptions for various nonlinear processes such as tidal stripping , tidal heating , and dynamical friction .",
    "the utility of this approach is its computational speed , allowing one to simulate multiple realizations and cover a broad region of model and parameter space compared to what can be achieved using expensive cosmological simulations .",
    "the drawback is that any simplifying assumptions ( e.g. , symmetries in the host potential , omission of substructure interaction ) inherent to the model may affect the final result in an unknown or unphysical manner .    in this paper , we present a detailed case study of an individual object simulated at high resolution ",
    "the via lactea ii ( * ? ? ?",
    "* vl2 ) simulation  with the aim of making connections relevant to semi - analytic models of substructure evolution .",
    "we focus on a self - consistent description of the most important physical processes and relationships , rather than on direct comparison to specific observations .",
    "our goal is to separate the robust quantitative predictions of this simulation from those that are unique to the particular background cosmology and random realization used to generate its initial conditions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : vl2data ] we describe our methodology of extracting substructure evolution from the public vl2 catalogues . in section [ sec : results ] we present the main results of our work .",
    "we begin in  [ sec : results1 ] with a basic description of the host halo and in  [ sec : results2 ] statistics of its subhalo population , followed in  [ sec : results3 ] with a presentation of orbital properties at the time of infall , and in  [ sec : results4 ] with a quantitative assessment of substructure evolution including the physical processes of tidal mass loss and its dependence on subhalo properties , the orbital timescale , changes in the orientation of the orbital plane , and the dynamical readjustment of the internal structure of subhalos as portrayed by their movement in the @xmath3 plane . in ",
    "[ sec : dispop ] we compare the surviving and disrupted subhalo populations of vl2 and investigate how survivability depends on infall redshift , mass , concentration , and orbital parameters .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the vl2 simulation traced the growth of a galactic host halo within a high - resolution region sampled with roughly one billion particles of mass . in what follows",
    "we make use of the main halo catalogue made publicly available by the vl2 team .",
    "this catalogue contains evolutionary tracks of all 20048 ( sub)halos within the simulation box that are resolved at @xmath4 and for which their peak circular velocity was larger than @xmath5 at some time during their evolution .",
    "the latter restriction is imposed to discard small halos affected by insufficient resolution .",
    "the catalogue contains a collection of halo properties at 27 discrete redshifts between @xmath6 .",
    "these properties include : the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 positions and velocities relative to the host halo rest frame ; the tidal radius , @xmath10 , and tidal mass , @xmath11 ; the maximum of the circular velocity curve , @xmath12 , and the radius , @xmath13 , at which this occurs .",
    "empty values occur at redshifts when the halo progenitor either did not exist or overlapped with a more massive halo . in what follows",
    "we consider only the redshift range @xmath14 for which the host progenitor was consistently identified within the simulation .",
    "this contains 19 redshift snapshots which we further refine by performing cubic spline interpolations of the above quantities to generate a total of 181 discrete sample points equally spaced by 68.8 myr .",
    "subhalos are identified in vl2 using the six - dimensional phase - space friends - of - friends ( 6dfof ) algorithm described in @xcite . around each ( sub)halo the circular velocity profile , @xmath15 , is computed in spherical bins and is fitted with the sum of contributions from an nfw profile and a constant density background , @xmath16 .",
    "the latter component is then subtracted from the ( sub)halo density profile and a tidal radius is computed by solving @xmath17 , corresponding to the tidal radius of an isothermal sphere on a circular orbit within an isothermal host @xcite . the tidal mass is assigned @xmath18 .",
    "for sufficiently isolated halos , where the background density is small and @xmath19 ( the radius at which the enclosed density is 200 times the mean _ matter _ density ) , @xmath10 is capped at @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( diemand , private communication ) .",
    "hence , the subhalo masses used in this paper are not the result of an unbinding procedure of dark matter particles .",
    "nevertheless , it was shown in the via lactea i ( vl1 ) analysis @xcite that this definition of tidal mass indeed agrees well with the true bound mass when the subhalo is near apocenter , but may significantly underestimate bound mass near pericenter .",
    "for this reason we generally only report mass quantities near apocenter and explicitly point out to the reader when this is not the case .    in the following subsections we define concepts and present our methodology of investigating substructure evolution from the vl2 data .",
    "we begin in  [ subsec : subdef ] with the definition of a subhalo . in  [ subsec : vl2con ] we model the internal structure of the host and its subhalos via concentration parameters .",
    "we define in  [ subsec : infdef ] the redshift , @xmath22 , at which a subhalo is said to first infall onto the host . in  [ subsec : eldef ]",
    "we outline our calculations of orbital energy and angular momentum and finish in  [ subsec : orbdef ] with a description of our method of tracing subhalo orbits after infall .    as a matter of convenience , we remove explicit redshift dependence in our following notation and",
    "remind the reader here that all quantities are computed at discrete times .",
    "we use lower case notation ( e.g. , @xmath23 , @xmath13 , @xmath12 ) when referring to subhalos while upper case notation ( e.g. , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) is reserved for the host .",
    "the mass of a subhalo is taken to be its tidal mass while the mass of the host is taken to be its virial mass ( see  [ subsec : vl2con ] ) .",
    "we often use @xmath27 to denote the instantaneous mass ratio between a subhalo and the host . at times",
    "we normalize to the present - day host mass in which case we define @xmath28 . in what follows",
    "we assume the same cosmology as the vl2 simulation ; namely , the @xmath2cdm parameters ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) = ( 0.238 , 0.762 , 0.73 , 0.951 , 0.74 ) from the wmap 3-year data release @xcite .",
    "we flag an object in the vl2 catalogue as a subhalo if at one time during its evolution it passed within the instantaneous virial radius of the host .",
    "this definition includes subhalos that are presently _ within _ the virial radius as well as subhalos that currently reside _ outside _ the virial radius .",
    "we refer to the latter group as _ ejected _ subhalos in the sense that they are now removed from the virial boundary of the host .",
    "this terminology , however , does not imply that these subhalos are unbound from the host , as shown in  [ sec : results - etainf ] .    in later sections we explore subhalo tidal mass loss .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that subhalos with too few particles within their tidal radius experience artificially large tidal mass loss .",
    "for this reason we impose a further restriction on the vl2 catalogue that only objects with at least 100 particles in their tidal radius at @xmath4 may be considered as subhalos .",
    "this sets a minimum mass resolution of @xmath0 .",
    "we find a total of 7569 objects meeting the above criteria .",
    "5845 ( 77% ) of these currently reside within the host virial radius of @xmath34 ( see  [ subsec : vl2con ] ) while the remaining 1724 ( 23% ) are currently ejected . for the remainder of the paper",
    "we exclude those subhalos whose infall ( see  [ subsec : infdef ] ) is determined to be @xmath35 .",
    "this reduces the total population to 6145 subhalos with 4607 ( 75% ) currently within the virial radius and 1538 ( 25% ) ejected .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that dark matter halos obey a universal density profile , named an nfw profile after its founders .",
    "this has the form @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the radius at which @xmath39 .",
    "the virial radius , @xmath40 , is defined such that the enclosed density is @xmath41 times the critical density , where @xmath41 is calculated using the fitting function to the overdensity of a virialized uniform sphere in a flat universe given in @xcite . an nfw profile is often parameterized by its concentration , @xmath42 , which describes the degree to which the mass is contained within the central region .",
    "we assume that the density profile of the host follows an nfw form .",
    "we determine its concentration by finding the unique nfw profile for which the mass enclosed within @xmath25 is @xmath43 .",
    "this involves the implicit solution of g(c_vir)=g(x_m)^2 , [ eq : croot ] where @xmath44 with @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the hubble parameter , and @xmath47 .",
    "once the concentration is obtained , the host halo mass is computed as @xmath48 where @xmath49 .    the assumption of an nfw profile for the host should be valid over the entire redshift range considered here . for subhalos , however , an nfw profile is only valid up until its moment of infall onto the host .",
    "it was shown by @xcite that the processes of tidal heating and stripping tend to modify the internal structure of subhalos away from their initial form .",
    "for this reason , we only use @xmath50 obtained from equation ( [ eq : croot ] ) for subhalos at their time of infall .",
    "afterwards , we define a concentration parameter c_max = 2 ^ 2 , [ eq : cproxy ] which gives the mean density within @xmath13 in units of the critical density . comparing to equation ( [ eq : croot ] )",
    "shows that , for any given redshift , there exists a monotonic relationship between @xmath50 and @xmath51 .      in an idealized description ,",
    "a subhalo will form distinct from its future host , accreting surrounding material and growing steadily in size .",
    "this process will occur until the time at which tidal interactions with its host become important . at this point",
    ", the combined action of dynamical friction and tidal stripping will cause the subhalo to lose mass over time .",
    "we therefore define infall as this turnaround phase in the growth history of the subhalo .",
    "that is , we define the redshift , @xmath22 , of infall onto the host to be the moment in time at which the mass of the subhalo is a maximum are biased toward larger values , though it is unclear to what magnitude group preprocessing affects premature mass loss . ] .",
    "recall that masses in vl2 are assigned as the mass contained within the tidal radius .",
    "the tidal radius is derived , at any moment , by equating the subhalo density profile to twice the local background density .",
    "for sufficiently isolated subhalos , where the background density is small , the tidal radius is capped at @xmath20 .",
    "the resultant tidal mass provides a good estimation of the true bound mass when the subhalo is near apocentre , which is generally the case at infall .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we consider only the 6145 subhalos for which @xmath52 since at earlier times the host progenitor is only sporadically identified within the vl2 catalogues , preventing us from computing orbital properties at those times .",
    "an alternative convention that is commonly used in the literature is to define infall as the moment the subhalo passes through the virial radius of the host .",
    "however , as shown previously @xcite , subhalos generally undergo strong tidal forces at distances larger than @xmath53 .",
    "furthermore , the virial radius evolves with redshift through its dependence on @xmath41 , meaning that its value will change even if the intrinsic mass profile of the host is unchanging .",
    "the virial radius is therefore not well - suited for defining the distance at which a subhalo becomes tidally truncated by the host , and can be said to undergo infall in the sense considered here .",
    "we determine the energy and angular momentum by assuming that subhalos evolve as isolated point particles within the spherically symmetric nfw profile of the host . in this case",
    ", the host potential is ( r ) = - , [ eq : nfwpot ] where @xmath54 is the radial separation between the subhalo and host . in this expression",
    "we have taken the zero point of the potential to be at infinity .",
    "the specific orbital energy of the subhalo is e = + ( r ) , [ eq : orben ] while its specific orbital angular momentum is l = * r * .",
    "[ eq : orbang ] here @xmath55 is the physical relative velocity between the subhalo and host which includes the sum of peculiar motion and hubble flow .",
    "in general , the continued action of dynamical friction will steadily drain energy and angular momentum from subhalo orbits .",
    "the evolution of a subhalo after infall thus depends strongly on its initial energy and angular momentum .",
    "it is therefore important to characterize the infall distributions of @xmath56 and @xmath57 as inputs in semi - analytic models of subhalo evolution .",
    "a common convention is to normalize these quantities in terms of a circular orbit of the same energy .",
    "we introduce two variables : ( i ) @xmath58 , defined to be the ratio of the radius , @xmath59 , of a circular orbit of the same energy @xmath56 as the subhalo to the virial radius , @xmath53 , of the host at infall ; ( ii ) the circularity , @xmath60 , defined to be the ratio of the subhalo angular momentum , @xmath57 , to the angular momentum , @xmath61 , of a circular orbit of the same energy . to compute @xmath62 and @xmath63",
    "we must first evaluate @xmath59 , which is achieved by numerically solving the expression + = - , [ eq : orbrcirc ] where @xmath64 .",
    "then @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the mass contained within radius @xmath67 of the host .     and @xmath26 at each redshift .",
    "open circles denote redshifts at which the vl2 catalogues are sampled while solid black lines trace the results derived from a cubic spline interpolation of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the dotted black lines in each panel show the expected evolution for the fitting functions given by @xcite for collapse times @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( see text ) .",
    "the vl2 curves are well contained within the shaded region , which may reflect an initial `` collapse '' at @xmath70 ( in the sense of the wechsler et al .",
    "formalism ) followed by an episode of significant mass accretion at @xmath71 which `` resets '' the concentration back to the virialization value of @xmath72 . ]",
    "the definitions of @xmath62 and @xmath63 used here are self - consistent with the description of a subhalo orbiting within an isolated nfw profile .",
    "this does not , however , conform with the standard method applied in semi - analytic models of substructure evolution . instead",
    ", it is common to report these quantities at the time when the subhalo first crosses through @xmath53 and to model the host potential as a point mass of @xmath73 . in this case , the orbital energy is e = - , [ eq : orbeng - sa ] and the radius of a circular orbit of the same energy is r_circ = - .",
    "[ eq : orbcirc - sa ] when discussing @xmath62 and @xmath63 at infall we report the results of both methods so that we can make direct comparisons to previous work .",
    "in  [ sec : results4 ] we compute subhalo quantities , such as tidal mass , taken over the course of an orbital period . to do so",
    "requires a precise definition of an  orbit \" .",
    "this is a complicated task since an orbit within a spherical potential is not closed , generally , and traces a rosette pattern , oscillating radially between a minimum pericenter , @xmath74 , and maximum apocenter , @xmath75 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the mass distribution in realistic halos departs significantly from spherical symmetry , due both to triaxiality in the smooth component , as well as substructure .",
    "finally , subhalos slowly spiral inward due to dynamical friction both from the background matter distribution as well as stripped material .",
    "consequently , energy and angular momentum are not in general conserved , and we require a robust and physical definition of an orbit that does not depend on simplifying assumptions such as spherical symmetry and conserved quantities .",
    "we choose to work solely from knowledge of the radial position of the subhalo as a function of time , determining the local minima ( pericenters ) and maxima ( apocenters ) . due to the somewhat coarse time information ,",
    "apocenters are generally more accurately determined than pericenters , since halos spend a larger fraction of time further away from the host center .",
    "thus , we define an orbit as that segment of the subhalo trajectory between two successive apocenters .",
    "a given orbit is therefore characterized by the time at first and last apocenters @xmath76 and @xmath77 , the two apocenters @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and the pericenter , @xmath80 .",
    "we take the mean of the two apocenters , @xmath81 , and define an effective eccentricity e_eff , [ eq : eff ] while the period of the orbit is @xmath82 .",
    "outliers with the smallest and largest present - day mass ratios , respectively . ]",
    "we begin by presenting the derived properties of the host halo using the method outlined in  [ subsec : vl2con ] .",
    "figure [ fig : mwh ] shows the redshift evolution of the host virial mass and concentration .",
    "open circles denote the redshifts for which the vl2 catalogues are sampled while the solid black lines trace the result we derive after performing a cubic spline interpolation on the time evolution of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",

    "the concentration evolves from @xmath86 at early times to @xmath87 at the present day .",
    "@xcite showed that halo concentration is strongly related to mass assembly history .",
    "in particular , evolution in concentration and virial mass can be described remarkably well using a single parameter , @xmath88 , defined as the formation or collapse time of the halo .",

    "the subhalo mass function provides a statistical measure of the amount of substructure within a host as a function of mass scale . in general",
    ", we can speak of two subhalo mass functions : the _ unevovled _ and _ evolved _ mass functions .",
    "the unevolved mass function counts the number of subhalos based on their mass at the time of infall .",
    "the choice of name emphasizes that this is a measure of the distribution of subhalos before they have had time to evolve under the influence of tidal processes within the host .",
    "the evolved mass function , on the other hand , counts the number of subhalos based on their present - day masses . in the middle panels of figure [ fig : dndm ] we plot both the unevolved and evolved subhalo mass functions measured from vl2 .",
    "we compare these to the corresponding mass functions from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bk10 ) which were fitted from the millennium ii @xcite and aquarius @xcite simulations .",
    "this is a useful comparison since bk10 considered host halos with similar masses to the vl2 host halo and use the same definition of @xmath22 as we do here .",
    "one difference , however , is that bk10 do not consider subhalos that reside outside the virial radius of the host at @xmath4 ( i.e. , ejected subhalos ; see  [ subsec : subdef ] ) . for more of a direct comparison",
    ", we also plot the vl2 mass functions with ejected subhalos removed .",
    "the bottom panels show more closely the comparison between vl2 and bk10 .",
    "the vl2 and bk10 unevolved mass functions agree well with each other over most of the mass range seen here .",
    "the sharp cutoff at small mass simply reflects the resolution limit of vl2 .",
    "there is considerable disagreement at the high mass end , though this regime is inherently noisy due to small number statistics .",
    "this can be seen in the top left panel where the cumulative distribution in @xmath92 at infall is shown ; only 11 objects with @xmath93 at infall exist .",
    "including ejected subhalos enhances the vl2 unevolved mass function by a constant factor indicating that infall mass does not play a significant role in determining whether a subhalo resides outside of @xmath53 at @xmath4 .",
    "note that the unevolved mass functions shown here correspond only to those subhalos that accrete onto the host and remain intact at @xmath4 .",
    "the red line in figure [ fig : dndm ] traces equation ( 21 ) of @xcite which shows the unevolved mass function for _ all _ subhalos ever accreted onto the host .",
    "this mass function is found to have a universal form @xcite , independent of host halo mass and cosmology , except perhaps a small dependence on @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the main difference between this mass function and that of surviving subhalos occurs at high @xmath94 where dynamical friction selectively disrupts massive subhalos after infall .",
    "the vl2 unevolved mass function ( black triangles ) agrees well with the red line albeit with a small systematic shift upwards . in  [ sec : dispop ] we analyze disrupted subhalos in vl2 and find that including them here would further boost the black triangles upward by @xmath95 in the range @xmath96 ( see figure [ fig : fdisrpt ] ) .",
    "we are indeed focusing on the low - mass regime where dynamical friction and tidal disruption are relatively unimportant for the vast majority of subhalos .",
    "the right panels of figure [ fig : dndm ] show the evolved counterparts .",
    "the evolved mass function can be thought of as a shift to lower mass due to tidal stripping .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the dark and lightly shaded blue lines .",
    "the vl2 evolved mass function lies systematically below the bk10 result at a level of about @xmath97 .",
    "bk10 quote an intrinsic halo - to - halo scatter of @xmath98 for @xmath99 which is not enough to explain the discrepancy seen here .",
    "instead , the difference observed here is most likely related to differences in cosmological parameters . in particular ,",
    "vl2 uses @xmath100 while aquarius simulates larger perturbations with @xmath101 .",
    "it is not straightforward to describe how this difference manifests in the evolved mass function since there are at least two competing effects . on the one hand ,",
    "the lower amplitude of fluctuations in vl2 will yield later formation times meaning that subhalos have less time on average to lose mass since infall . on the other hand , later formation times also yield lower subhalo concentrations which promote more efficient mass loss ( see  [ subsec : resmloss ] ) .",
    ", to the virial radius of the host , @xmath53 , at that time .",
    "the black histogram traces the total sample of subhalos while the blue and red histograms show distributions for the @xmath102 outliers with the smallest and largest infall redshifts , respectively .",

    "the mean and standard deviation of these fits are given in table [ table : lognorms ] . ]",
    "another factor that may contribute to this difference lies in the definition of tidal mass used by vl2 . as described in ",
    "[ sec : vl2data ] , subhalo masses in vl2 are underestimated at pericenter due to the simplified scheme used in computing mass based on local density comparisons .",
    "this is in contrast to the unbinding procedure used by aquarius with the code subfind @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the vl2 evolved mass function will be biased toward smaller masses as some subhalos will be found near pericenter at @xmath4 ( the unevolved mass function is less affected since subhalos are generally near apocenter at infall ) .",
    "nevertheless , we only expect this to be a partial effect since a suppression of @xmath97 was also seen in @xcite when comparing vl2 and aquarius @xmath12 functions .",
    "the physical mechanism leading to the systematic difference between the vl2 and aquarius evolved mass functions remains to be seen .      in this section",
    "we focus on subhalo statistics at the time of infall onto the host .",
    "in particular , we investigate the redshift at which infall occurs (  [ sec : results - zinf ] ) , the radial distance from the host at which tidal truncation initiates (  [ sec : results - rinf ] ) , and show distributions in orbital energy (  [ sec : results - etainf ] ) and angular momentum (  [ sec : results - epsinf ] ) at infall .",
    "the results presented here are important as inputs into semi - analytic models of substructure evolution and extend the results of previous works to much lower mass .      in figure",

    "this seems to occur in such a way as to mostly cancel the evolution in @xmath53 with @xmath9 .",
    "the difference between the black and gray histograms in figure [ fig : eta ] can therefore be mostly explained by two effects : ( 1 ) larger @xmath53 at @xmath118 and ( 2 ) smaller @xmath67 at @xmath118 .",

    "compared to the latter are various curves showing the circularity distributions employed in semi - analytic models of substructure evolution : the blue dotted curve is the distribution from @xcite ; the green dashed curve is the distribution given by z05 ; the red dot - dashed curve is the distribution from @xcite . ]",
    "the gray histogram , with median @xmath128 , is in reasonable agreement with the various curves used in semi - analytic models .",
    "there is , however , a clear excess in nearly circular orbits with @xmath124 .",
    "the reason for this is the same as was discussed in the previous section .",
    "it was shown in j15 that circularity is highly dependent on mass , with high mass subhalos tending to move along radial orbits while low mass subhalos tend to have more circular orbits .",
    "one possible explanation is related to the environment in which these objects form .",
    "high mass halos are more biased towards forming in high density regions such as filaments and are consequently more likely to fall radially into their host with lower specific angular momentum .",
    "low mass subhalos are less biased to forming within filaments and are thus more likely to fall into their host with a larger component of tangential motion .",
    "another possible explanation , independent of the first , is that low - mass subhalos are simply more likely to acquire tangential motion from gravitational interactions with nearby massive objects prior to infall .    in the bottom panels of figure [ fig : etaeps ]",
    "we show the dependence of @xmath63 on mass , redshift , and concentration . as with @xmath62 , we find that @xmath63 does not exhibit strong mass dependence in the range @xmath99 probed by vl2 .",
    "there also does not appear to be much dependence on @xmath22 , consistent with the earlier work of @xcite .",
    "there is correspondingly little dependence on @xmath63 with infall concentration . replacing the lower panels of figure [ fig : etaeps ] with @xmath63 computed at virial crossing for a point mass host potential produces the same ( lack of ) trends .",
    "even though the two methods produce similar trends in figure [ fig : etaeps ] , it remains difficult to qualitatively describe the differences between the black and gray histograms in figure [ fig : circ ] .",
    "the reason is the dependence of @xmath61 on the form of the host potential assumed .",
    "in fact , we find that @xmath63 , unlike @xmath62 , is very sensitive to the form of the host potential .",
    "for example , computing @xmath63 at infall with a point mass host potential pushes the black histogram in figure [ fig : circ ] to even larger values .",
    "counter intuitively , computing @xmath63 at virial crossing with an nfw host potential also pushes the gray histogram to larger values , being almost on top of the black histogram .",
    "we therefore note that one should be careful in choosing a fitting function for @xmath63 that suits their specific needs .",
    "we fit the circularity distributions in figure [ fig : circ ] with the following form : = a ^(b - ) ^.

    "only those 2714 subhalos ( @xmath132 of the total population ) that complete at least two orbits after infall are shown . ]    in this section we focus on the evolution of subhalo properties over the course of infall to the present day .",
    "this includes internal subhalo properties such as tidal mass and central density as well as orbital properties including radial period and angular momentum .",
    "our results are used to test some of the fundamental assumptions underlying models of substructure evolution .",
    "a common assumption in modeling tidal mass stripping is that subhalos of a given mass lose a certain fraction of their mass in one dynamical time .",
    "for example , @xcite developed a model in which the mass loss rate of a given subhalo is @xmath133 where @xmath134 is proportional to the free fall time of a halo , independent of mass .",
    "recently , @xcite used numerical simulations to fit the mass dependence , finding @xmath135 .",
    "this is very close to the case @xmath136 , in which the fractional mass loss rate is independent of mass .",
    "modeling dynamical friction and sinking due to the resultant loss of angular momentum plays a prominent role in modeling subhalo orbital evolution .",
    "the trajectory of subhalos through the host must be modeled accurately .",
    "assumptions typically involve spherical symmetry , wherein the torque of dynamical friction is in the direction of the subhalo orbital angular momentum , and subhalos orbit in the same plane .",
    "the question naturally arises whether common assumptions such as those discussed above hold for the low - mass subhalos considered here . in the following sections , we examine",
    "separately the mass lost per orbit per halo mass , the orbital period per host dynamical time , and the alignment of tidal torques and angular momentum .",
    "the general picture of mass loss is related to the processes of dynamical friction and tidal stripping , as follows .",
    "the continued force of dynamical friction causes an infalling subhalo to slowly descend into its host . as the orbital radius shrinks , so too does the tidal radius , causing the subhalo to continually shed mass from the outside - in .",
    "the internal structure of the subhalo is also affected , generally puffing outwards due to the injection of tidal heat , promoting additional mass loss .",
    "mass loss will vary over the course of an orbital period , being strongest ( weakest ) at pericenter ( apocenter ) when tidal interactions with the host are greatest ( smallest ) .",
    "tidal mass loss is clearly a complicated process that will depend on both the internal structure of a subhalo as well as its orbital parameters .",
    "we begin our investigation of mass loss in figure [ fig : deltamdist ] where we plot distributions in @xmath138 . here",
    ", the mass change is @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the mass at the start and end of the orbit , respectively .",
    "the black histogram shows mass loss over the course of the first orbit after infall while the blue histogram shows mass loss over the last orbit before @xmath4 .",
    "recall that we define an orbit to correspond to the time between successive apocenter passages so the `` first '' orbit does not start exactly at infall and the `` last '' orbit does not end exactly at @xmath4 . more specifically , the first orbit begins at the first apocenter after infall while the last orbit terminates at the last apocenter before the present time .",
    "we find that 3966 ( @xmath142 ) subhalos finish at least one orbit after infall while 2714 ( @xmath132 ) finish at least two .",
    "since we are interested in comparing how mass loss changes with time , we plot only those 2714 subhalos for which the first and last orbit is different .",
    "comparing the two distributions in figure [ fig : deltamdist ] shows that subhalos tend to lose a larger fraction of their initial mass during their first orbit compared to their last orbit .",
    "in particular , the median mass loss in the first orbit is @xmath104 of the initial mass while the median mass loss in the last orbit is about an order of magnitude smaller , at @xmath143 of the initial mass .",
    "note that not all subhalos lose mass over the course of an orbital period .",
    "in particular , for both the first and last orbit , roughly @xmath144 of subhalos actually _ gain _ mass .",
    "this likely occurs either through direct merger with smaller systems or , more gradually , through the accretion of surrounding material .",
    "we proceed to investigate the dependence of mass loss on subhalo properties .",
    "the top row of figure [ fig : deltam ] shows mass loss versus mass ratio at the start of the orbit . for both orbits ,",
    "more massive subhalos tend to lose more mass on average .",
    "normally , we would expect this result on the basis of a dynamical friction argument whereby the oribts of massive subhalos are preferentially dragged into the depths of the host , promoting enhanced mass loss .",
    "however , we do not expect this argument to apply here since the dynamical friction merging timescale for @xmath145 subhalos is much longer than the hubble time @xcite .    instead , the observed correlation with mass is the result of the mass - concentration relation which states that more massive subhalos will be less concentrated on average .",
    "we plot as blue circles ( red triangles ) the @xmath146 outliers with the smallest @xmath147 ( largest @xmath147 ) values of @xmath148 at the start of the orbit . from the definition of @xmath51 in equation ( [ eq : cproxy ] ) ,",
    "the ratio @xmath148 describes the relative central density of the subhalo to the host . in both panels",
    "a clear dichotomy emerges with the least ( most ) concentrated , and most ( least ) massive , subhalos loosing ( retaining ) more mass per obit .",
    "this is made more apparent in the middle row of figure [ fig : deltam ] where we see a strong negative slope in mass loss versus concentration .",
    "there is still considerable scatter at fixed concentration which can be partly attributed to eccentricity .",
    "comparing blue circles and red triangles shows that for fixed concentration , more circular ( radial ) orbits tend to retain ( lose ) more mass on average . a direct comparison is plotted in the bottom row of figure [ fig : deltam ] where we detect a small correlation between mass loss and eccentricity .",
    "we have also checked for correlation between mass loss and pericenter , @xmath80 .",
    "one would expect that subhalos plunging further into the depths of the host , where tidal forces are strong , would experience enhanced mass loss .",
    "we instead find almost no correlation with @xmath80 is based upon a cubic spline interpolation of subhalo radial distance from discrete vl2 snapshots ( see  [ sec : vl2data ] ) .",
    "the snapshots are separated by 0.688 gyr which may lead to a potentially crude estimation of the true @xmath80 . another way to estimate",
    "@xmath80 is to solve the roots in the equation of motion of a point particle of energy @xmath56 and angular momentum @xmath57 in a static nfw host potential ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this may lead to a better determination of @xmath80 as @xmath56 and @xmath57 vary more smoothly with time than radial distance .",
    "nevertheless , we have checked that using @xmath80 computed in this way changes neither the results on mass loss versus eccentricity nor mass loss versus pericentre . ] .",
    "the reason is that subhalos closer to the host center tend to be more concentrated ( see  [ sec : results - rinf ] ) which washes out the dependence on @xmath80 .",
    "we conclude that tidal mass loss in the regime of low - mass subhalos is most directly correlated with concentration .",
    "when concentration is held fixed , we find no trend in mass loss with varying mass .",
    "the apparent trend seen when comparing mass loss versus mass is simply a reflection of the fact that mass is correlated with concentration .",
    "this result makes physical sense in the limit of weak dynamical friction since it is the density of a subhalo , relative to its host , that determines how tightly a subhalo on a stable orbit retains its contents ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at fixed concentration ,",
    "subhalos on more eccentric ( i.e. , radial ) orbits tend to lose more mass than subhalos on circular orbits .",
    "this may highlight the importance of tidal heating which results when a rapidly varying gravitational potential injects energy into subhalos , puffing them outwards and promoting further mass loss ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "shown as the dashed line is the relationship expected for radial orbits ( eccentricity @xmath151 ) orbiting a point with mass @xmath73 . ]",
    "the dynamical time for a halo is usually defined as the free - fall time of a test particle in a static , uniform sphere at the virial density , @xmath152^{-1}=\\frac{\\pi^2r_{\\rm vir}^3}{4gm_{\\rm vir}}. \\label{eq : tau}\\ ] ] it is natural to expect , all else being equal , that timescales within the halo should scale in proportion to this dynamical time .",
    "for example , the time to complete an orbit is roughly proportional to the dynamical time .",
    "similar scaling arguments apply for timescales other than orbital period , such as the tidal mass loss time , @xmath153 .",
    "departures from a simple linear scaling with the dynamical time occur because orbital shapes vary from subhalo to subhalo .",
    "for example , halos on larger orbits should have longer orbital times , with a correlation between semi - major axis and period that reflects the mass distribution of the host halo around the virial radius .     and infall .",
    "the black histogram traces the total sample of subhalos while the blue and red histograms show the @xmath102 outliers with latest and earliest infall , respectively .",

    "interestingly , there are two  clouds \" of subhalos . those with high concentration at small radius , and those with low concentration at large radius .    also shown is the relationship expected for radial orbits ( where the semi - major axis @xmath157 ) around a point mass with @xmath158 , @xmath159 . combining with equation ( [ eq : tau ] ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath160 subhalos would lie along this line only if they were on radial orbits and all the halo mass was located at the halo center . in general , departures from radial orbits ( @xmath161 ) lead to longer orbital times , while the presence of matter outside the virial radius ( i.e. the overdensity associated with continuous infall onto the host ) leads to shorter orbital times .",
    "the latter effect could be responsible for the shorter times at @xmath162 , although more information about the evolving density profile outside the virial radius would be required to make a quantitative comparison .",
    "a common assumption made in models of substructure evolution is spherical symmetry of the host .",
    "subhalo orbits are generally integrated in either a static potential or one that dynamically adjusts ( e.g. , through mass accretion ) in a spherically symmetric manner . in either case , the direction of the orbital angular momentum vector is conserved since it is aligned with the direction of the torque . hence , an obvious test of spherical symmetry within vl2 is to look for changes in the orientation of the orbital plane .    in figure",

    "this point is made more illuminating by plotting @xmath168 versus @xmath166 , as in figure [ fig : rvmaxev ] . in the left panel",
    "we colour points according to the mass retained at @xmath4 while the right panel shows concentration at infall .",
    "the left panel shows a clear gradient in colour , reinforcing the notion of previous works @xcite that evolution in internal structure does not depend on _ how _ mass is lost , but only _ how much _ mass is lost . as expected , however , subhalos are not bound to a single trajectory in the @xmath181 plane .",
    "the right panel shows that scatter at fixed mass loss can be attributed to concentration , as in figure [ fig : rmaxev ] .",
    "the median evolution for all subhalos is shown as the solid black line in each panel with @xmath102 scatter shaded in gray .",
    "the purple line fits the median trend using equation ( [ eq : penfit ] ) with @xmath182 .",
    "this sits above the p10 result that was derived from subhalos of fixed @xmath183 ; a considerably larger value than the median concentration of 7 found in vl2 .",
    "up to this point we have only considered the population of subhalos that _ survive _ to the present day .",
    "this leaves open questions regarding any potential biases that may exist in our results due to the omission of _ disrupted _ subhalos . in this section",
    "we attempt to address these questions by making use of the second vl2 public catalogue .",
    "the second catalogue contains a similar set of evolutionary tracks as the main catalogue except that it pertains to the 20000 largest systems in the simulation box identified at @xmath84 .",
    "the two catalogues are not mutually exclusive as some of the surviving subhalos at @xmath4 also happened to be of the largest systems present at @xmath84 .",
    "the utility of the second catalogue is that it contains subhalos that disrupt prior to the present day . though this does not constitute the _ full _ ensemble of disrupted subhalos ( some subhalos that disrupt were not of the largest systems at @xmath84 ) it should be enough to elucidate differences between surviving and disrupted subhalos . for convenience",
    "we henceforth refer to the main vl2 data set ( considered in all preceding sections ) as vl2-d1 and refer to the second data set as vl2-d2 .",
    "we apply the same framework outlined in  [ sec : vl2data ] to vl2-d2 .",
    "namely , we identify subhalos as those systems that at some point passed within the instantaneous virial radius of the host . of these subhalos",
    "we identify the surviving population as those that still exist as intact objects at @xmath4 .",
    "conversely , the disrupted population consists of those subhalos that fall below the mass resolution of the vl2 halo finder some time before reaching @xmath4 .",
    "we find a total of 4843 subhalos in vl2-d2 of which 3843 ( 79% ) belong to the surviving group and 1000 ( 21% ) belong to the disrupted group .",
    "note that @xmath184 of the 6145 subhalos from vl2-d1 are also part of vl2-d2 .",
    "we examine in figure [ fig : fdisrpt ] the dependence of survivability on infall redshift , mass ratio , and concentration . in the top panels , we plot the distribution in each quantity for all surviving ( disrupted ) subhalos from vl2-d2 as solid blue ( dashed red ) lines . for comparison",
    ", the solid black line traces the distribution in each quantity for the vl2-d1 subhalos .",
    "the vertical dotted lines denote the median value of the distribution with the corresponding colour . in the bottom panels ,",
    "the dashed red line traces the ratio , @xmath185 , of disrupted to surviving subhalos in vl2-d2 , with the horizontal red line denoting the mean value @xmath186 . to test for bias in the surviving fraction of vl2-d2 subhalos",
    ", the solid blue line traces the ratio , @xmath187 , of the surviving subhalos in vl2-d2 to the full ensemble of surviving subhalos contained in vl2-d1 .",
    "the horizontal blue line denotes the mean fraction @xmath188 .",
    "we begin with infall redshift .",
    "the blue line in the bottom left panel shows that vl2-d2 is slightly biased towards containing those surviving subhalos with larger values of @xmath22 .",
    "this reflects the fact that subhalos with smaller values of @xmath22 were less likely to exist as large objects at @xmath84 when vl2-d2 was constructed .",
    "comparing the surviving and disrupted populations in vl2-d2 shows that subhalos with @xmath189 are much more likely to belong to the latter group .",
    "that is , subhalos spending more time exposed to the tidal field of the host are more likely to disrupt by the present day .",
    "next we investigate mass ratio at infall .",
    "the middle panels of figure [ fig : fdisrpt ] show little dependence of survivability in the mass range @xmath190 . for larger masses",
    ", we expect the disrupted fraction to increase as dynamical friction preferentially causes massive subhalos to plummet into the depths of the host where tidal forces are strongest .",
    "we indeed see an upturn at @xmath191 though vl2 is hindered by small number statistics in this regime to make a meaningful statement here .",
    "we also observe a rapid rise in the disrupted fraction for @xmath192 .",
    "this is expected due to the finite mass resolution of the simulation ",
    "subhalos closer to the resolution limit are more likely to `` disrupt '' .",
    "there is a related drop in the blue line in the bottom middle panel indicating that the missing surviving population in vl2-d2 are almost exclusively low - mass subhalos .",
    "this reflects the early infall bias in vl2-d2 : subhalos nearer the resolution limit are only likely to survive to @xmath4 if they infall later .",
    "we finish by examining infall concentration in the right panels of figure [ fig : fdisrpt ] .",
    "first , we see that vl2-d2 is biased towards containing low - concentration surviving subhalos , consistent with the early infall bias via the concentration - redshift relation ( see figure [ fig : crvz ] )",
    ". moreover , of all subhalos in vl2-d2 , those with @xmath193 are much more likely to disrupt by @xmath4 .",
    "this is consistent with our previous finding that low - concentration subhalos are more susceptible to tidal stripping from the host ( see figure [ fig : deltam ] ) .",
    "in fact , the strong dependence of survivability on @xmath50 and not on @xmath92 strengthens the notion that mass loss is more strongly connected to concentration than mass for low - mass ( @xmath99 ) subhalos .",
    "we now shift focus to the infall distribution of orbital energy and angular momentum for surviving versus disrupted subhalos . in figure",
    "[ fig : eta - d2 ] we plot the infall distribution of @xmath62 for the surviving ( disrupted ) subhalos in vl2-d2 as a blue ( red ) histogram .",
    "the blue histogram can be compared to the black histogram showing the infall distribution for all surviving subhalos in vl2-d1 ( i.e. , the black histogram in figure [ fig : eta ] ) .",
    "we see good agreement between the surviving vl2-d2 subhalos and the full vl2-d1 population .",
    "the disrupted population , on the other hand , agrees well with the other curves for @xmath194 , but displays a much flatter distribution for smaller @xmath62 .",
    "most importantly is the excess at @xmath120 , indicating that subhalos strongly bound to the host at infall are preferentially disrupted by @xmath4 .     for all surviving vl2 subhalos ( black histogram ) , the surviving subhalos in the vl2-d2 catalogue ( blue histogram ) , and the disrupted subhalos in the vl2-d2 catalogue ( red histogram ) .",
    "the gray histogram shows the result of combining the total population of surviving subhalos with the vl2-d2 disrupted population . in each case",
    "we report @xmath62 at @xmath22 for an nfw host potential .",
    "the results are qualitatively similar if we consider virial crossing with a point mass host potential . ]",
    "this result suggests that the black histogram is suppressed at @xmath120 compared to the distribution of _ all _ subhalos that ever fell onto the host , regardless of survivability .",
    "the gray histogram in figure [ fig : eta - d2 ] shows the result of combining the disrupted subhalos in vl2-d2 with the vl2-d1 catalogue .",
    "doing so results in only a minor change to the black histogram since there are six times fewer disrupted subhalos than surviving subhalos .",
    "though we do not have access to the full ensemble of disrupted subhalos , it seems unlikely that we are missing a large enough fraction for there to be a significant impact on the infall distribution and fitting functions for @xmath62 presented in  [ sec : results - etainf ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : circ - d2 ] we plot the infall distribution of @xmath63 for the surviving ( disrupted ) subhalos in vl2-d2 as a blue ( red ) histogram .",
    "the surviving population can be compared to the black histogram showing the infall distribution for all surviving subhalos in vl2-d1 ( i.e. , the black histogram in figure [ fig : circ ] ) . in this case",
    ", we see good agreement between all histograms .",
    "hence , unlike orbital energy , angular momentum does not appear to play a significant role in determining the survivability of subhalos . the infall distribution and fitting functions for @xmath63 presented in ",
    "[ sec : results - epsinf ] are therefore robust to the inclusion of disrupted subhalos .     for all surviving vl2 subhalos ( black histogram ) , the surviving subhalos in the vl2-d2 catalogue ( blue histogram ) , and the disrupted subhalos in the vl2-d2 catalogue ( red histogram ) .",
    "in each case we report @xmath63 at @xmath22 for an nfw host potential .",
    "the results are qualitatively similar if we consider virial crossing with a point mass host potential . ]",
    "we have analyzed the publicly available vl2 halo catalogue in order to characterize the infall properties , orbital dynamics , and structural evolution of over 6000 subhalos within a galactic host .",
    "our main focus is on the role of subhalo concentration in each of these categories , and how this relates to @xmath4 observables , such as circular velocity and size .",
    "we define subhalo infall as the time when a halo reaches maximum mass .",
    "in other words , a halo becomes a subhalo when its growth is halted , mainly due to tidal truncation from the host .",
    "after infall , subhalos experience mass loss from tidal forces and exhibit internal readjustment as they gradually sink toward the host center .",
    "we focus on low - mass subhalos for which dynamical friction plays only a minor role , leading to qualitatively different behaviour than is often described for high - mass subhalos . in the following paragraphs",
    "we report the main results of our paper .",
    "we compare the unevolved and evolved subhalo mass functions with the results published from the aquarius simulations .",
    "the unevolved mass function uses the mass of each subhalo _ when it fell in _ while the evolved mass function uses the mass at @xmath4 , showing the cumulative effect of tidal mass loss after infall . while the unevolved mass functions agree well , the evolved vl2 mass function is systematically lower , by @xmath97 , corresponding to a downward shift in mass ( figure [ fig : dndm ] )",
    ". the lower normalization of the vl2 simulation ( @xmath195 vs. @xmath196 ) could be the origin , although the physical explanation remains unclear ( see  [ sec : results2 ] ) .",
    "several important relationships among subhalo properties at the time of infall emerge : ( 1 ) the typical infalling halo mass does not evolve significantly with time , with a value of @xmath197 ( figure [ fig : crvz ] and also figure [ fig : fdisrpt ] ) . ( 2 ) rare , massive halos fall in much later than less massive ones , as expected in hierarchical structure formation ( figure [ fig : zinfall ] ) .",
    "( 3 ) halos that fall in earlier have lower concentrations , consistent with the well - known concentration - mass - redshift relationship for dark matter halos at fixed mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* see figure [ fig : crvz ] ) .",
    "( 4 ) halos that fall in earlier or , equivalently , that have lower concentrations at infall , tend to experience tidal growth truncation at a larger radius ( figures [ fig : rinfall ] and [ fig : crvz ] ) .",
    "the orbital energy and angular momentum of subhalos at infall are significantly different than reported in previous studies that focused on more massive subhalos .",
    "the low - mass subhalos found in vl2 are skewed toward lower specific binding energy ( figure [ fig : eta ] ) and slightly more circular orbits ( figure [ fig : circ ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the recent results of @xcite .",
    "the explanation for these trends may be related to the environment in which objects form  massive subhalos fall into the host preferentially along filaments , leading to tightly bound , radial orbits  and/or gravitational interactions prior to infall that preferentially inject energy and tangential motion into low - mass subhalo orbits .",
    "we find that subhalos undergo most of their mass loss on the first pericenter passage , with a median mass loss fraction of @xmath198 ( figure [ fig : deltamdist ] ) .",
    "the fraction of mass lost in the first pericenter passage is most correlated with halo concentration at infall ",
    "less concentrated halos tend to undergo more mass loss , nearly independent of mass ( figure [ fig : deltam ] ) .",
    "there is a significant but less pronounced correlation of mass loss fraction with subhalo mass , but this trend is only apparent , being explained by the fact that more massive halos have lower concentrations on average and are thus more susceptible to tidal effects .",
    "scatter in mass loss at fixed concentration can be mainly attributed to eccentricity with radial orbits tending to lose more mass than circular orbits .",
    "the period of the first orbit after infall is roughly proportional to the dynamical time of the host halo , @xmath199^{-1/2}$ ] .",
    "there is significant scatter , however , in the apocenter , @xmath155 , which results in a comparable scatter in @xmath156 ( figure [ fig : tovertau ] ) .",
    "the scatter originates in the concentration of the infalling subhalos : low - concentration subhalos begin to be disrupted earlier and thus experience much longer initial orbits than subhalos with higher concentrations .",
    "motion in a spherical potential , in which the direction of angular momentum does not change , is not a good approximation to subhalo orbital dynamics .",
    "in particular , the direction of the angular momentum vector is not fixed .",
    "after a few orbits , the direction of the angular momentum is essentially randomized .",
    "this seems to be a generic feature of subhalo evolution in highly inhomogeneous , triaxial host halos ( figure [ fig : angmom ] ) .",
    "as subhalos are tidally disrupted by the host halo , their maximum circular velocities and radii steadily decrease , tracing out tracks in the @xmath12@xmath13 plane . while the joint median evolution , as well as their individual dependence on tidal mass , are in qualitative agreement with previous studies , we find a substantial amount of scatter",
    "furthermore , this scatter can be mostly attributed to variations in the concentration at infall .",
    "the difference is most pronounced in the evolution of @xmath13 : subhalos that are _ more concentrated _ at infall experience a _ weaker evolution _ in @xmath13 as they lose mass ( figure [ fig : rmaxev ] ) .",
    "concentration at infall determines evolution in the @xmath12@xmath13 plane ( figure [ fig : rvmaxev ] ) .",
    ": we find that subhalos with early infall and/or low concentration are preferentially disrupted within the host ( figure [ fig : fdisrpt ] ) .",
    "we find no dependence of survivability on mass within the range probed by vl2 .",
    "these results are consistent with the notion that tidal mass loss is correlated with concentration instead of mass for low - mass subhalos .",
    "the typical infalling mass of @xmath200 ( @xmath201 ) is true for both surviving and disrupted subhalos .",
    "circularity does not influence subhalo survivability .",
    "there is a slight bias in tightly bound orbits with @xmath120 being preferentially disrupted though this is a relatively small effect .",
    "the infall distributions and fitting functions for @xmath62 and @xmath63 presented in  [ sec : results - etainf ] and  [ sec : results - epsinf ] based on surviving vl2 subhalos should do a good job at representing the infall distribution for _ all _ subhalos ( surviving plus disrupted ) that ever fell onto the host ( figures [ fig : eta - d2 ] and [ fig : circ - d2 ] ) .",
    "this is the case at both @xmath22 with an nfw host potential as well as @xmath118 with a point mass host potential .    in this work",
    "we have extended previous detailed analyses of subhalo dynamics and evolution to the much lower mass ratios probed by the via lactea ii data .",
    "we have found qualitatively different behaviour in this low - mass regime , with dynamical friction and orbital dynamics playing a lesser role , and the interior structure of the subhalos , expressed in terms of concentration , playing a much more important role .",
    "the ` concentration bias ' we find here raises the prospects of significantly improving our ability to connect ultra - faint dwarf galaxies to the primordial fluctuations from which they collapsed .",
    "more detailed study , in particular with finer time resolution and a larger sample of simulated galactic host halos , will be necessary before we can reliably use concentration bias in near field cosmology ."
