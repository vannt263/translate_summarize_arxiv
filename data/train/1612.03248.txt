    "the astronomical observations show that our universe is probably approaching de sitter spacetime .",
    "the cosmological constant corresponds to vacuum energy and is usually considered as a candidate of dark energy .",
    "the accelerating universe will evolve into another de sitter phase . in order to construct the entire history of evolution of the universe",
    ", we should have a clear perspective to the classical and quantum properties of de sitter spacetime  @xcite .",
    "however , as is well known that in de sitter space there is no spatial infinity and no asymptotic killing vector which is globally timelike .",
    "moreover , black holes in de sitter spacetime can not be in thermodynamic equilibrium in general . because there are multiple horizons with different temperatures for de sitter black holes .",
    "the thermodynamic quantities on the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon all satisfy the first law of thermodynamics , moreover the corresponding entropies both fulfill the area formulae  @xcite .",
    "there have been accumulated interest to the thermodynamics property of de sitter spacetime in recent years  @xcite . in this way",
    ", the two horizons can be analyzed independently . besides , one can also take a global view to construct the globally effective temperature and other effective thermodynamic quantities .",
    "no matter which method is used , the total entropy of de sitter black hole is supposed to be the sum of both horizons , namely @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite    we think that the correct method may to be so simple because the event horizon and the cosmological horizon are not independent .",
    "there may exist some correlations between them due to the following considerations .",
    "we can take the kerr - de sitter black hole as example .",
    "there are first laws of thermodynamics for both horizons . according to @xcite ,",
    "the thermodynamic quantities on the two horizons satisfy the first law of thermodynamics system , [ 1st ] dm&=&t_+ds_++_+ dj+v_+d , + dm&=&-t_cds_c+_c dj+v_cd , where @xmath2 is the conserved mass in de sitter spacetime , @xmath3 and @xmath4 stand for the angular velocities and angular momentum , and the cosmological constant @xmath5 as a pressure and define the thermodynamically conjugate variable to the thermodynamics volume , which can be different from the geometrical volume , the subscript @xmath6 denotes the black hole horizon and the subscript @xmath7 denotes the cosmological horizon . including the variable @xmath5 ,",
    "the above first laws can have corresponding smarr formulae , which are also given in @xcite .",
    "the two laws in eq.([1st ] ) are not truly independent .",
    "they depend on the same quantities @xmath8 .",
    "all the geometric and thermodynamic quantities for the both horizons can be represented by @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the size of black hole horizon is closely related to the size of the cosmological horizon , and the evolution of black hole horizon will lead to the evolution of the cosmological horizon .",
    "considering the relation between the thermodynamic quantities on the two horizons is very important for studying the thermodynamic properties of de sitter spacetime  @xcite .",
    "considering the correlation or entanglement between the black hole event horizon and the cosmological horizon , the total entropy of the kerr - de sitter black hole is no longer simply @xmath9 , but should include an extra term from the contribution of the correlations of the two horizons . in the ref .",
    "@xcite , we calculate the extra term in the entropy for the spherically symmetric charged black hole in de sitter spacetime . by the method we obtain the reasonable interpretation for the r - n black hole in de sitter spacetime . in this",

    "kerr - de sitter black hole is a solution of einstein equation in @xmath10 dimensions with a positive cosmological constant @xmath11 .",

    "the event horizon and cosmological horizon coincide _ apparently _ and have the same temperature , zero or nonzero  @xcite .    considering the connection between the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon  @xcite , we can derive the effective thermodynamic quantities and corresponding first law of black hole thermodynamics as the pressure and then derive the effective volume . in this case",
