    "extra - terrestrial neutrinos have been regarded as one of the most promising tools to investigate the non - thermal universe . due to their low interaction cross section , neutrinos",
    "retain their original source information such as direction and energy spectrum .",
    "however , the low interaction cross section makes it difficult to detect neutrinos which must interact within or near the telescope .",
    "the size of the telescope must thus be large enough to collect a sufficient number of neutrinos to find and probe extra - terrestrial sources .",
    "amanda - ii is a neutrino telescope consisting of 677 optical modules attached to 19 strings , deployed between 1500 m to 1950 m depth within a 200 m diameter in glacial ice at the south pole .",
    "following the success of amanda - ii , the cubic kilometer - sized icecube experiment started construction in 2005 . by the spring of 2007 , 22 strings with 1320 digital optical modules ( doms ) out of the 4800 planned had been deployed , at a depth of 1450 m - 2450 m surrounding amanda - ii .    with these observatories",
    "numerous analyses are performed to search for extra - terrestrial neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "the target of diffuse analysis are neutrinos from unresolved sources .",
    "if the neutrino flux from an individual source is too small to be detected by point source search techniques  @xcite , it is nevertheless possible to investigate their characteristics by combining events from isotropically distributed sources .",
    "the extra - terrestrial neutrinos are predicted to follow a energy spectrum resulting from shock acceleration processes  @xcite .",
    "since the atmospheric neutrino flux has a much softer energy spectrum , an excess of events at higher energy over the expected atmospheric neutrino background would be indicative of an extra - terrestrial @xmath46 flux .",
    "in this paper we present analyses with amanda - ii data collected during the period 20002003 and icecube data obtained with 9 strings ( ic9 ) in 2006 .",
    "neutrinos are the ideal cosmic messengers that allow us to probe the origin of cosmic rays and high energy mechanisms that shaped our universe , since they can propagate through huge distances almost undisturbed from their sources .",
    "detection of neutrinos in correlation with possible sources of cosmic rays would be the awaited smoking gun that would prove hadronic acceleration .",
    "on the other hand , the very same reasons that make neutrinos interesting cosmic messengers , make them also difficult to detect , requiring large volume detectors deployed in the deep oceans or in the antarctic ice @xcite .",
    "the icecube observatory is a kilometer - cube size neutrino telescope in construction at the geographic south pole @xcite , and it presently consists of 22 strings ( hence tagged as ic22 ) .",
    "the strings are located on an hexagonal array with a spacing of about 125 m , each of which contains 60 digital optical sensors that are 17 m apart .",
    "icecube embeds the predecessor amanda - ii array , which consists of 677 analog optical sensors compactly arranged in 19 strings @xcite .",
    "the goal of neutrino telescopes is the detection of high energy neutrinos of extra - terrestrial origin @xcite .",
    "the major background is the intense flux of downward muons produced by the impact of cosmic rays on the earth s atmosphere : about a million of them for each neutrino - induced event .",
    "the virtually background free upgoing atmospheric neutrinos constitute a foreground of diffuse events among which we search for the high energy extra - terrestrial events .",
    "the icecube observatory will collect an unprecedented statistics of atmospheric neutrinos , allowing us to measure this foreground and to understand it , and , therefore , to do neutrino astrophysics .",
    "the main objective for neutrino telescopes is the detection of astrophysical neutrinos at energies above some tens of gev , which would prove proton or nuclei acceleration in sources .",
    "this discovery would help in identifying the sources of the ultra - high energy cosmic rays observed up to about @xmath72 ev in giant air shower arrays .",
    "the analysis techniques illustrated here aim at finding the signal of neutrinos from point - sources on top of the background of atmospheric neutrinos , which is more uniformly distributed in arrival direction .",
    "we refer to other contributions at this conference for a general introduction to icecube and for the detection of diffuse and atmospheric neutrino fluxes @xcite .",
    "icecube is now running with 22 strings ( ic22 ) and during this construction season , just started in nov .",
    "2007 , we aim at installing 14 to 18 more strings .",
    "when completed in 2011 , it will be composed of up to 80 strings ( ic80 ) holding 4800 photomultipliers at depths between about 1.5 and 2.5 km in the antarctic ice .",
    "icecube can measure all neutrino flavors but muon neutrinos are the only ones that allow a pointing accuracy at the level of a degree .",
    "hence we focus here on this channel .",
    "searches for steady - state emission of neutrinos from point - sources typically require a sample of neutrinos with @xmath73 contamination by background atmospheric muons . to achieve this goal we are limited to lower ( northern ) hemisphere searches , unless other time or energy - dependent constraints",
    "are included in the analysis ( eg . for bursting emissions such as gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) or very high energy extra - galactic sources with much harder spectra than atmospheric neutrinos ) .",
    "the earth acts as a filter and absorbs the background of atmospheric muons .",
    "it begins to absorb neutrinos above the pev range depending on the direction , which determines the column density crossed by neutrinos .",
    "the first results of ic9 are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] , together with the 2005 - 6 data of amanda - ii , which combined with the previous 5 years @xcite constitutes the largest sample of high energy neutrinos ever collected for these studies ( 924 + 887 in 386 d in 2005 - 6 + 4282 in 1001 d in 2000 - 4 ) .",
    "these results , together with the anticipated performance for various configurations of icecube and expected and measured results from other experiments are represented in fig 1 ( left ) , summarizing the state of the art for neutrino point - like source searches .",
    "another approach is based on the fact that , unlike muon which emits cherenkov photons throughout its track , trajectories of neutrinos are invisible to the optical sensors and thus a starting neutrino induced event leaves sizable number of doms without photon signal near the neutrino trajectories .",
    "this can be observed in the characteristic lateral distributions .",
    "shown on the left and middle in fig .",
    "[ fig_lateral ] is the number of photo electrons recorded in each dom as a function of lateral distance ( ld ) of the doms from the mc - truth trajectories of the through - going @xmath74 and @xmath53 respectively .",
    "the green band at the bottom of each distribution represents those doms recording less than 0.3 photo - electron . to describe the difference",
    ", we define the two right triangles shaded in black and red shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_lateral ] .",
    "one has the right apex at zero ld , and the other at the ld of the closest ld doms with no photon signal recorded . taking the ratio of the areas of these triangles event - by - event",
    ", it is observed that neutrino induced events are more likely to give this ratio close to unity because doms without photon hit exist at smaller lateral distances .",
    "the area ratio distributions are shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_lateral ] .",
    "the plot indicates that this method identifies approximately 70 % of the starting neutrino events with the area ration cut of 0.85 , while rejecting 99.95 % of muon events .",
    "cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere create pions , kaons , and charmed hadrons which can later decay into muons and neutrinos .",
    "the main background for this analysis consists of atmospheric muons traveling downward through the ice .",
    "diffuse analyses use the earth as a filter to search for upgoing astrophysical neutrino - induced events .",
    "once the background muons have been rejected , the data set mainly consists of neutrino - induced upward events  @xcite . to separate atmospheric neutrinos from extra - terrestrial neutrinos",
    ", we make use of the number of optical modules that reported at least one cherenkov photon during an event ( @xmath47@xmath48 ) as the energy estimator .",
    "the number of events above an @xmath47cut has been compared with sets of monte - carlo prediction for e@xmath49 and atmospheric neutrino models ( bartol  @xcite , honda  @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath47cut was optimized to produce the best limit setting sensitivity  @xcite . in",
    "order not to bias the analysis , data above the resulting @xmath47cut were kept hidden from analyzer while the lower @xmath47events were compared to atmospheric neutrino expectations from bartol and honda .",
    "searches for a diffuse flux have been performed with amanda - ii data obtained 2000 - 2003 ( 807 days livetime )  @xcite .",
    "the observed @xmath47distribution is compared to the atmospheric neutrino background calculations in figure  [ nch_sigrescaled ] . for @xmath47@xmath50 region ,",
    "6 events were seen , while 7.0 were expected . using the range of atmospheric uncertainty ( shaded band in figure [ nch_sigrescaled ] ) in the limit calculation  @xcite leads to an upper limit on a @xmath51 flux of muon neutrinos at earth of @xmath0@xmath52 @xmath2 .",
    "this upper limit is valid in the energy range 162500 tev .",
    "figure  [ sensitivity ] shows the upper limit on the @xmath53 flux from sources with an e@xmath49 energy spectrum .",
    "the limit from the amanda - ii 807 days analysis is a factor of four above the waxman - bahcall upper bound  @xcite .    -.5",

    "the atmospheric muon rejection and @xmath47cut threshold are re - optimized  @xcite to accommodate the new detector geometry .",
    "the finalized @xmath47cut=33 for the ic9 137 days gives a sensitivity @xmath0@xmath54 @xmath2  on the neutrino energy range of 25 tev to 10 pev , which is a factor of two above the amanda - ii 807 day upper limit .",
    "since the sensitivity of ic9 137 days was well above the amanda - ii upper limit , we revealed the high - energy events ( @xmath47@xmath5533 ) for the sake of a verification study of the detector .",
    "6 events were observed while 6.5 were expected from the bartol atmospheric neutrino model  @xcite , which indicates no signal observation , consistent with the better amanda - ii upper limit .",
    "it is an encouraging sign that the ic9 137 day is within a factor of two of the 807 day amanda - ii result . with same atmospheric muon rejection and @xmath47cut as ic9",
    ", a sensitivity of icecube 22 strings ( ic22 ) for 137 days is expected to reach @xmath0@xmath56 @xmath2 .",
    "this is already a factor of three better than ic9 .",
    "improvements of event separation to extract extra - terrestrial neutrinos from atmospheric neutrinos  @xcite are ongoing together with the optimization of background muon rejection for the ic22 geometry , which should improve the sensitivity further .",

    "an upward moving event in a neutrino telescope would be guaranteed to be neutrino - induced muon track , if the direction reconstruction was not affected by any ambiguity . in reality , less than 5% of the downward muon bundles are mistakenly reconstructed as upgoing . moreover , in the ic22 array , about 5% of the recorded events are pairs of uncorrelated muon bundles that happen to pass through the detector in time coincidence . around 10% of the coincident events mimic upward moving tracks .",
    "both these sources of background are in excess of about @xmath57 with respect to the neutrino - induced events , if no specific selection criteria are applied .",
    "the event selection is designed to achieve a good track directional resolution .",
    "for instance , requiring an angular resolution of about 2@xmath58 , we can collect about one atmospheric neutrino per hour in the ic22 array ( with a selection efficiency of about 15 - 20% ) , of which about 10 - 15% are fakes .",
    "the first analysis of atmospheric neutrinos in icecube was performed on data collected by the first 9 strings during 2006 .",
    "234 events were recorded in 137.4 days livetime , with an expectation of 211@xmath5976.1(syst)@xmath5914.5(stat ) from monte carlo simulations @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ic9 ] , most of the selected neutrino events have energy just below 1 tev .",
    "the low energy profile is dominated by the experimental trigger and selection efficiency , while the high energy shape is determined by the steep spectrum and neutrino cross section .",
    "the detection of electron neutrino - induced events is more critical than muon events , since their rate is about one order of magnitude lower that the one of muon neutrinos .",
    "such events in icecube are identified through the hadronic cascades produced by charged current interactions .",
    "the main background is due to bremsstrahlung energy loss by muon bundles .",
    "a detailed study on background rejection is under way .",
    "the criteria currently under investigation to achieve a good background rejection , result in a neutrino energy threshold of 100 gev . at these energies , the uncertainty on the flux of atmospheric neutrinos is estimated to be larger than 30% @xcite .",
    "almost one third of the uncertainty is due to the composition of cosmic rays above 1 tev , and the reminder to the high energy hadronic interaction models . due to kinematical reasons , neutrinos produced in the decays of kaons",
    "( k ) dominate the atmospheric flux above about 100 gev @xcite , with uncertainties significantly larger than on pion ( @xmath60 ) production in the same energy region .",
    "therefore the measurement of atmospheric neutrinos below 100 gev would probe a region affected by smaller theoretical uncertainties and would help in constraining the absolute normalization . with theoretical uncertainties below 25% , we can test the experimental capabilities of the icecube experiment and assess its systematics down to that order of magnitude .",
    "the ic22 and amanda - ii arrays can detect events in time coincidence , lowering the neutrino energy threshold to about 30 gev ( resulting in about 50% more events , see fig [ fig : low ] ) , since amanda - ii is a denser detector and , combined with icecube , improves the track angular resolution below 100 gev . at 30 gev",
    "standard oscillations inevitably affect the measurement of neutrino flux , and for vertical tracks , about 70% of muon neutrinos have oscillated into another flavor @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "experimental energy and angular resolutions dilute the effect of oscillations .",
    "a less systematics prone reconstruction of high quality low energy upward moving tracks close to the icecube strings , is under way .",
    "the muon neutrino survival probability has its minimum at 30 gev for vertical tracks .",
    "since the optical sensors are only 17 m apart , it is possible to statistically estimate the muon track length @xmath61 and its energy @xmath62 , and deconvolve them in a l@xmath63/e@xmath63 measurement with minimized systematics due to the @xmath64 kinematics , where @xmath65 is the neutrino path length and @xmath66 the neutrino energy .",
    "due to the steep atmospheric neutrino spectrum most of the events are around a few tev . above this energy",
    "the detailed measurement of the spectrum slope depends on the primary cosmic ray spectrum and composition , on the k production in the atmosphere and , mainly above 100 tev and on the yet unknown contribution of charm production .",
    "the atmospheric muon flux is also used to probe interaction models .",
    "the @xmath67 ratio measured by the minos experiment at about 1 tev has provided an important constraint on the k@xmath68/k@xmath69 ratio in the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "neutrinos are even more heavily affected by the k ratio above 1 tev , therefore this constraint is more relevant for neutrino production . with icecube",
    "it will be possible to probe the k/@xmath60 relative contribution to the atmospheric neutrino flux , with a combined analysis of energy and zenith angular shapes .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos above 10 tev can be used to probe the internal structure of the earth , that starts to be opaque to neutrino propagation at about 25 tev , where the earth s diameter equals the neutrino absorption length @xcite . due to the steepness of the atmospheric neutrino energy spectrum",
    ", icecube will take 10 years to become sensitive to the earth s matter profile , providing direct geophysical information . above 100",
    "tev neutrinos starts to be dominated by the decay of heavy mesons and baryons containing the charm quarks @xcite .",
    "this component of the atmospheric neutrinos is still very uncertain , mainly because of the unknown baryon contribution .",
    "a better assessment of the charm background is critical for the discovery of a high energy extra - terrestrial signal .",
    "the first hit dom method shows high efficiency but it relies on a single dom information and requires state - of - the - art level of understanding of the detector response .",
    "the lateral distribution method can be more reliable , but a high accuracy of the track trajectory reconstruction is necessary .",
    "note that the present study uses the simulation truth trajectories .",
    "we also found that irreducible background to this approach is a muon decay event which very rarely occurs in ehe range .",
    "a combination of the two methods described here might provide a more reliable way to identify neutrino induced events with less dependence on detailed detector response ."
