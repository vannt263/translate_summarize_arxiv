    "2 .   @xmath0 is a uniform glivenko - cantelli class with respect to the family of non - atomic probability measures .",
    "martin s axiom ( ma ) @xcite is one of the most often used and best studied additional set - theoretic assumptions beyond the standard zermelo - frenkel set theory with the axiom of choice ( zfc ) .",
    "in particular , martin s axiom follows from the continuum hypothesis ( ch ) , but it is also compatible with the negation of ch , and in fact it is namely the combination ma+@xmath38ch that is really interesting .",
    "the concept class in our initial simple example ( which is even image admissible souslin @xcite ) shows that in general ( 7 ) and ( 8) are not equivalent to the remaining conditions .",
    "notice that for universally separable classes , ( [ mainth:1 ] ) , ( 7 ) and ( 8) are equivalent without additional set - theoretic assumptions .",
    "the core of the theorem  and the main technical novelty of our paper  is the proof of the implication ( [ mainth:4])@xmath39([mainth:1 ] ) .",
    "it is based on a special choice of a consistent learning rule @xmath13 having the property that for every concept @xmath40 , the image of all learning samples of the form @xmath41 under @xmath13 forms a uniform glivenko  cantelli class .",
    "it is for establishing this property of @xmath13 that we need martin s axiom .",
    "most of the remaining implications are relavely straightforward adaptations of the standard techniques of statistical learning .",
    "nevertheless , ( [ mainth:3])@xmath39([mainth:4 ] ) requires a certain technical dexterity , and we study this implication in the setting of boolean algebras .",
    "we begin the paper by reviewing a general formal setting , followed by a dicussion of boolean algebras which seem like a natural framework for the problem at hand , especially in view of possible generalizations to learning under other intermediate families of measures .",
    "in particular , we will show that our version of the vc dimension modulo countable sets , @xmath25 , is just the usual vc dimension of the class @xmath0 of concepts extended over a suitable compactification of @xmath1 and restricted to a certain subdomain of the compactification .",
    "now the part of theorem [ th : main ] for universally separable concept classes follows easily .",
    "afterwards , we discuss martin s axiom , prove the existence of a learning rule with the above special property , and deduce theorem [ th : main ] for arbitrary concept classes .",
    "we need to fix a precise setting , which is mostly standard .",

    "usually either @xmath46 is the set of all probability measures ( distribution - free learning ) , or @xmath47 is a single measure ( learning under fixed distribution ) . in our article , the case of interest is the family @xmath48 of all non - atomic measures .",
    "every probability measure @xmath7 on @xmath1 defines a distance @xmath49 on @xmath43 as follows : @xmath50 we will not distinguish between a measure @xmath7 and its lebesgue completion , that is , an extension of @xmath7 over the larger sigma - algebra of lebesgue measurable subsets of @xmath1 .",
    "consequently , we will sometimes use the term _ measurability _ meaning _",

    "already in the case of learning under a single measure , it is not so : a pac learnable class under a single distribution @xmath7 need not be uniform glivenko - cantelli with regard to @xmath7 ( cf .",
