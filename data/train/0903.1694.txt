    "recently , the discovery of high temperature superconductivity in oxypnictide compounds @xcite stirred great interests in the condensed matter community . one important problem is to elucidate the pairing symmetry of the order parameter of the superconducting state .",
    "theoretically many possible gap pairing symmetries have been proposed . due to the proximity of the superconducting state to a collinear antiferromagnetic state",
    ", a magnetism - based mechanism has emerged in both the weak and strong coupling approaches .",
    "this mechanism suggests that an extended s - wave pairing symmetry is favored@xcite .",
    "the weak - coupling approach favors an s - wave ( so called @xmath4 ) state@xcite in which the relative sign of order parameters changes between the hole and electron pockets .",
    "however , the weak - coupling approach does not specify the exact form of order parameter . in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", we showed that , in strong - coupling , the pairing symmetry is determined mainly by the next nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange coupling @xmath5@xcite and has an explicit @xmath6 form in momentum space , @xmath0 .",
    "this result is completely independent of any model , _ as long as _ the dominating interaction is next - nearest neighbor @xmath5 _ and _ the fermi surfaces are located close to the @xmath7 and @xmath8 points in the brillouin zone .",
    "the @xmath9 changes sign between the electron and hole pockets in the brillouin zone . in this sense , it resembles the order parameter , @xmath4 , proposed through general weak - coupling arguments @xcite .",
    "the magnitudes of superconducting gaps measured by angle - resolved photo - emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) on different fermi surfaces are in good agreement with the simple @xmath0@xcite .",
    "the magnetic properties in the sc state have also been shown to be consistent with the proposed pairing symmetry@xcite .",
    "although several theoretical works@xcite propose different ways to measure the sign change between the electron and hole pockets , directly probing this change is still a fundamental experimental challenge . without any detailed calculations , a theoretical suggestion for probing the sign change through quasiparticle interference ( qpi ) in the presence of magnetic and nonmagnetic impurities . has been made in @xcite .",
    "the qpi can be probed directly in modern stm experiments@xcite and has been intensively studied in copper - based high temperature superconductors . in the presence of impurities ,",
    "elastic scattering mixes two eigenstates with different momentum @xmath10 and @xmath11 on the same contour of constant energy and a scattering interference pattern appears as a modulation in the local density states ( ldos ) at wavevector @xmath12 .",
    "such kind of interference pattern in the wavevector space can be observed in the fourier transform scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( ft - sts ) @xcite .",
    "the quasiparticle scattering between regions in the @xmath13 space with high density of states ( dos ) yields peaks or arcs in the ft - sts .",
    "for example , in the d - wave pairing sc state , many qpi dispersive peaks can be identified ; in the cuprates , they provide details of the band structure , the nature of superconducting gap . or other competing orders@xcite .    in this paper , we perform a detailed investigation of the qpi in iron - based superconductors .",
    "we use both two orbital and five orbital models .",
    "in general , the qpi strongly depends on the bare band structure .",
    "the qpi patterns change significantly from a two orbital model to a five - orbital one , which suggests that the qpi can provide direct information of the detailed band structure and orbital degrees of freedom . by carefully examining the pattern ,",
    "we can also identify common features of the qpi pattern in both models , which are tied to the symmetry of sc order parameter and the impurity type .",
    "these general features include : ( 1 ) the intra - orbital scattering by impurities always dominates the inter - orbital scattering .",
    "the latter has negligible effect on the qpi ( though it breaks discrete @xmath14 symmetry of the patterns ) ; ( 2 ) unlike in the d - wave sc state of cuprates where a large density of states at the banana tips cause dispersive features in the qpi@xcite , the nodeless s - wave has little density of states inside sc gaps and hence no strong points dominate the scattering ; ( 3 ) a magnetic impurity always causes a broad and large peak near @xmath15 in the qpi ; this stems from intra - band scattering . for a non - magnetic impurity ,",
    "the intensity around @xmath15 is small .",
    "this result can be used to distinguish two types of impurities ; ( 4 ) the peaks around @xmath2 and @xmath3 are sensitive to both the type of impurities and to the sign change of the sc orders between the electron and hole pockets .",
    "magnetic impurities along with sign - unchanged sc orders or non - magnetic impurity with sign - changed sc orders cause strong interference peaks . finally ,",
    "as in a fully - gapped s - wave sc state the results from a full t - matrix calculation do not differ considerably from results of a simple first order perturbation calculation@xcite , we are able to also provide an analytic derivation of the above results .",
    "we first investigate the qpi in a simple two orbital model@xcite .",
    "the mean field hamiltonian of the model in sc states is written as @xmath16 with @xmath17 where @xmath18 in the nambu formalism .",
    "the single - particle bands read @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 is chosen in the electron - doped regime .",
    "hereafter , @xmath24 will be used as the energy unit . for @xmath6 -wave pairing ,",

    "since it was argued that for cuprate superconductors this @xmath42-matrix method is valid when impurity scattering strength is much larger than the maximal pairing gap@xcite , we take @xmath43 in our calculation .",

    "this is confirmed ( but not shown here ) by the fact that , when decreasing the imaginary part of the energy @xmath28 in green s functions , the peaks of @xmath69 are sharper , while @xmath70 vanish trivially for all @xmath71 .",
