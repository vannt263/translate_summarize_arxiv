    "* yang - baxter integrability has been a central theme in mathematical , statistical , and quantum physics for more than half a century , see , e.  g. , the volume @xcite for a collection of foundational works .",
    "this article is concerned with two of its very recent and closely related applications to :    \\(a ) theory of symmetric functions , with new families of symmetric functions being introduced and new summation identities for older ones being proved , see @xcite ;    \\(b ) deriving new exact formulas for averages of observables in two - dimensional integrable lattice models and ( 1 + 1)-dimensional random growth models , and using those to study large scale and time asymptotics @xcite .",
    "all the above cited papers deal with the @xmath2-matrix for the ( higher spin ) six vertex model and its degenerations ( in other words , with representations of the affine quantum group @xmath3 and their limits ) .",
    "certain progress has been achieved for the @xmath4 case as well , with new markov chains introduced via the corresponding @xmath2-matrices @xcite and a duality functional for them provided in @xcite .",
    "the goal of this work is to climb higher in the hierarchy and to extend some of the recent progress from vertex models to the so - called _ interaction - round - a - face ( irf ) models _ , also known as _ face _ and _ solid - on - solid ( sos ) models_. the corresponding @xmath2-matrices satisfy a face version of the star - triangle relation also known as the dynamical yang - baxter equation .",
    "the irf models were originally introduced by baxter @xcite as a tool to analyze the eight vertex model , but they quickly became a subject on their own , see , e.  g. , @xcite and references therein .",
    "we will only be concerned with the @xmath5 case , the basic instance of which is due to the original work @xcite and is often called the _ eight vertex sos model _ , and whose fused versions were introduced and extensively studied in @xcite .",
    "the irf models were framed in a representation theoretic language by felder @xcite , who introduced the concept of an _",
    "elliptic quantum group_. the simplest instance is the quantum elliptic group @xmath0 ; the corresponding representation theory and the algebraic bethe ansatz were developed by felder - varchenko in @xcite .",
    "the latter works are a convenient starting point for us ; we extensively use their notations and results .    as the first step ,",
    "we take the wavefunctions constructed in the algebraic bethe ansatz framework of @xmath0 and consider their infinite volume limit .",
    "such a limit makes bethe equations on spectral parameters unnecessary , and the resulting objects are symmetric elliptic functions in their spectral parameters . in a suitable limit",
    ", they degenerate to the symmetric rational functions that were studied in @xcite , which are , in their turn , generalizations of the classical ( symmetric multivariate ) hall - littlewood polynomials .    using the yang - baxter integrability ( equivalently , the irf star - triangle relation , or the dynamic yang - baxter equation , or the commutation relations of the elliptic quantum group )",
    ", we show that these symmetric elliptic functions satisfy versions of the pieri , cauchy , and skew - cauchy identities from the theory of symmetric functions .",
    "this requires an introduction of a family of dual symmetric elliptic functions , as well as skew variants of both families ( the term ` skew ' is used by a direct analogy with the theory of symmetric functions , where skew schur , hall - littlewood , etc .",
    "polynomials are broadly used ) .",
    "we also prove a kind of orthogonality relations for our functions .",
    "all the results are derived from an infinite volume limit of the @xmath0 algebraic bethe ansatz ; this is largely parallel to what was done in @xcite for @xmath3 .    in order to proceed to a construction of stochastic models ,",
    "we need to find a simplification of the cauchy identities mentioned above .",
    "we achieve it by taking a trigonometric limit of our symmetric elliptic functions and finding a specialization of the dual family that simplifies it dramatically .",
    "even though this brings us closer to the objects studied in @xcite , we still have one extra parameter in the game .",
    "we call it the _ dynamic _ parameter ; it is responsible for the word ` dynamic ' in the dynamic yang - baxter equation that is behind our model .",
    "it is this simplification that tells us how to renormalize the weights of the associated irf model to make it _ stochastic _ , which basically means that the new @xmath2-matrix is stochastic , and the random states of the model can be constructed by a markovian procedure involving only sampling of independent bernoulli random variables .",
    "the existence of such a renormalization that also preserves the integrability of the model does not seem _ a priori _ evident , and we view the construction of the stochastic irf model as the first main result of the present paper .",
    "we show how our stochastic irf model can be degenerated to certain interacting particle systems in ( 1 + 1)d that we call _ dynamic exclusion processes _ ; they are one - parameter generalizations of the usual exclusion processes with rates of jumps depending on the local value of the height function ( which is closely related to the dynamic parameter ) .",
    "these dynamic exclusion processes appear to be new , and we expect them to enjoy the same degree of integrabiliy as the usual exclusion processes .    our second main result is an explicit evaluation of averages of certain observables for stochastic irf models in a quadrant .",
    "the observables are quite simple yet rather nontrivial , and we discover them by analyzing the cauchy identities and orthogonality relations for the appropriate trigonometric limits of the symmetric elliptic functions discussed above .",
    "our method is similar to that of @xcite , although things get more complicated because of the presence of the dynamic parameter .",
    "also , the fact that this approach should bring a result is not _ a priori _ obvious , and our first naive attempts to apply the philosophy of @xcite were actually unsuccessful .",
    "surprisingly , the averages we compute turn out to be independent of the dynamic parameter , which suggests that there may be a smarter way of evaluating them .    in the non - dynamic case of @xmath3 ,",
    "the similar observables were always the @xmath1-moments of a suitably defined height function .",
    "the corresponding formulas have already been extensively used to obtain asymptotics in a large variety of probabilistic systems , see the references in part ( b ) of the first paragraph above and references therein .",
    "we hope that the new observables will allow to replicate at least some of that success , but at the level of the irf models or dynamic interacting particle systems .    as a step towards that goal , we take one of the simplest new models  the dynamic symmetric simple exclusion process ( ssep )  and use our observables to analyze its one - point asymptotics at large times for the step initial condition .",
    "we discover different growth exponents than for the usual ssep and , surprisingly , the lack of the deterministic limiting height profile at large times .",
    "let us now describe some of our results in more detail .    * the stochastic irf model . *",
    "the model has a number of ( generally speaking , complex ) parameters that we denote as : @xmath6  this is a planck constant type parameter associated with the quantization parameter @xmath7 ; @xmath8  the overall shift of the dynamic parameters , @xmath9  the inhomogeneity and spin ( or highest weight ) parameters associated to columns marked by the @xmath10-coordinate ; @xmath11  the spectral parameters associated to rows marked by the @xmath12-coordinate that can also be thought of as inhomogeneity parameters .",
    "we do not have the spin parameters that vary row - by - row ( or rather we have the spin parameter 1 for all rows ) ; adding those is possible but leads to substantial increase in complexity that we want avoid in this work , cf .",
    "* section 5 ) in the vertex model case .",
    "we will only consider stochastic irf models in a quadrant with specific boundary conditions , although other domains and boundary conditions are certainly possible .",
    "the states of our stochastic irf model in the quadrant @xmath13 are functions @xmath14 ; we will call the value @xmath15 the _ filling _ or the dynamic parameter of the unit square @xmath16\\times[y , y+1]$ ] in the quadrant .",
    "the fillings of two squares that share a horizontal edge must differ by an @xmath17 , while the fillings of two squares with shared vertical edge with coordinate @xmath10 must differ by an element of @xmath18 , unless @xmath19 for integral @xmath20 and @xmath21 . ' in this formula plays no role as the weights of our model do not depend on it , cf .",
    "below ; in what follows we will simply take @xmath22 . ] if @xmath23 is of that form , the difference must be an element of the small set @xmath24 , which shrinks to @xmath17 in the spin @xmath25 case @xmath26 .",
    "the probability measure on the @xmath27 s that we are interested in , is a limit of its projections  finite probability distributions on the cylindric sets defined by prescribing all the fillings @xmath28 inside finite growing squares @xmath29 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "the weight of such a finite filling is defined as the product of boltzmann factors over all @xmath30 squares ( called _ plaquettes _ ) of the form @xmath31\\times[y , y+2]$ ] with @xmath32 .",
    "the above conditions on @xmath27 s imply that each plaquette must be of one of the types pictured in figure [ fig : intro1 ] with varying @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the spin @xmath25 plaquettes are pictured in figure [ fig : intro2 ] .",
    "irf vertices . ]",
    "if one wants to encode only the information about the differences between fillings rather than their actual values , there is another convenient graphical way of doing that , which is also included in figures [ fig : intro1 ] and [ fig : intro2 ] .",
    "namely , one draws a suitable number of upward and rightward arrows along the inner lattice edges of the plaquette as illustrated there .",
    "when such arrows are combined for all the plaquettes , they form directed lattice paths that move in the up - right direction .",
    "the procedure of passing from fillings to up - right paths projects the irf model states to those for the higher spin six vertex model , and our irf models actually converge to those vertex models as @xmath35 , see section [ ss : hs6v ] below .",
    "we will impose boundary conditions on @xmath27 along the sides of the quadrant by requiring that @xmath36 this is equivalent to saying that @xmath37 , and the up - right paths from the previous paragraph enter the quadrant as rightward arrows joining @xmath38 and @xmath39 for all @xmath40 .",
    "finally , to complete the definition of the stochastic irf model , let us give the the boltzmann weights of the four plaquette types of figure [ fig : intro1 ] .",
    "they are , in the same order as in figure [ fig : intro1 ] , @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the filling of the top left unit square of the considered plaquette , and @xmath44 need to be specialized to @xmath45 with @xmath46 being the coordinates of the center of the plaquette .",
    "there are several ways to choose the parameters of the model so that these weights are actually nonnegative , and the probabilistic terminology we used above makes sense .",
    "however , our principal results are purely algebraic , they do not depend on this nonnegativity , thus we will not focus on it at the moment .",
    "the above plaquette weights satisfy the identities @xmath47 which can be interpreted as follows : if we fix the fillings of the three unit squares along the left and bottom sides of a plaquette , then there are two possibilities for the filling of its top right square , and the sum of weights for these two possibilities is always equal to 1 .",
    "this makes it possible to construct random states inductively ",
    "one starts from the left and bottom borders of the quadrant where the values of @xmath27 are prescribed by the boundary conditions , and gradually moves inside the quadrant by filling unit squares whose left and bottom neighbors have already been filled , with each step requiring a bernoulli random variable with biases given by one of the identities .",
    "we also see that the measures on fillings of @xmath29 $ ] defined by taking products of such plaquette weights are consistent for different @xmath48 s .",
    "* the observables .",
    "* for any @xmath49 and an irf configuration in the quadrant , define @xmath50 as the number of up - right paths that pass through or below the vertex with coordinates @xmath51 .",
    "our boundary conditions imply @xmath52 , and it suffices to know the fillings of the finitely many unit squares in the rectangle @xmath53\\times[0,y+1]$ ] to know what @xmath50 is .",
    "we call @xmath54 the _ height function _ for our irf model .",
    "let us introduce another observable at @xmath46 that is closely related to the height function and is defined by @xmath55 where we use the notations @xmath7 and @xmath56 .",
    "a known @xmath57 yields two possible values of @xmath58 by solving a quadratic equation . in many cases",
    "this allows to reconstruct @xmath50 uniquely as one of the roots would not satisfy natural inequalities imposed by the model .",
    "[ th : intro1 ] for any @xmath59 and @xmath60 , we have @xmath61=e^{-2\\pi{\\mathbf{i}}\\eta\\,\\bigl(\\frac{n(n-1)}2+ny-\\sum_{i=1}^n{\\lambda}_{[1,x_i)})\\bigr)}\\\\ \\times\\oint\\dots\\oint \\prod_{1\\le i < j\\le n } \\frac{f(v_i - v_j)}{f(v_i - v_j+2\\eta)}\\prod_{i=1}^n\\bigg(\\prod_{j=1}^{x_i-1}\\frac{f(v_i - p_j)}{f(v_i - q_j)}\\prod_{k=1}^y \\frac{f(v_i - w_k-2\\eta)}{f(v_i - w_k)}\\bigg)\\,{dv_i } ,      \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the integration contours are positively oriented loops around @xmath62 ( alternatively , the integral can be replaced by the sum of possible residues at @xmath63 for all @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) .",
    "observe that the right - hand side of is independent of @xmath8 , which is quite surprising .",
    "taking the limit @xmath35 turns the left - hand side into @xmath66 $ ] , where the expectation is with respect to a stochastic higher spin six vertex in the same quadrant . in this limit",
    "the equality was actually proved as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 9.11 ) , and since then two other proofs have appeared in @xcite .",
    "if all the plaquette weights are nonnegative and the observables are real , the averages uniquely determine the joint distribution of the observables @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 for any @xmath70 .    * dynamic exclusion processes . * in the spin @xmath25 case ( equivalently , @xmath71 ) there is a way of specializing the parameters of the stochastic irf model in such a way that the weights of the 2nd and 5th plaquettes in figure [ fig : intro2 ] become infinitesimally small .",
    "looking at a finite neighborhood of the diagonal of the quadrant infinitely far from the origin reveals a novel interacting system that we call the _ dynamic asymmetric simple exclusion process _ ( asep , for short ) .",
    "the dynamic asep is a continuous time markov chain on the state space of integer - valued sequences @xmath72 subject to the condition @xmath73 for any @xmath74 .",
    "alternatively , the increments @xmath75 can be encoded by a particle configuration in @xmath76 , where we say that there is a particle that resides at @xmath77 if and only if @xmath78 .",
    "we will only consider the initial condition @xmath79 at time @xmath80 , which corresponds to particles filling up the negative semi - axis @xmath81  the so - called step initial condition .",
    "the dynamical asep depends on two parameters @xmath82 ( here @xmath7 is the same as before , and @xmath83 in terms of the earlier notation ) .",

    "( ssep ) defined as follows .",
    "it is again a continuous time markov chain on the state space of integer - valued sequences @xmath72 subject to the condition @xmath73 for any @xmath74 , and it depends on a single parameter @xmath92 .",
