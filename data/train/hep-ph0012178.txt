    "although the standard model ( sm ) , based on the gauge symmetry @xmath0 describes the observed properties of charged leptons and quarks it is not the ultimate theory .",
    "however , the necessity to go beyond it , from the experimental point of view , comes at the moment only from neutrino data  @xcite . if neutrinos are massive then new physics beyond the sm is needed . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the sm can not be a fundamental theory since it has so many parameters and some important questions like that of the number of families do not have an answer in its context . on the other side ,",
    "it is not clear what the physics beyond the sm should be .",
    "an interesting possibility is that at the tev scale physics would be described by models which share some of the faults of the sm but give some insight concerning some questions which remain open in the sm context .",
    "one of these possibilities is that , at energies of a few tevs , the gauge symmetry may be @xmath1 ( 3 - 3 - 1 for shortness ) instead of that of the sm  @xcite . in fact , this may be the last symmetry involving the lightest elementary particles : leptons .",
    "the lepton sector is exactly the same as in the sm but now there is a symmetry , at large energies among , say @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "once this symmetry is imposed on the lightest generation and extended to the other leptonic generations it follows that the quark sector must be enlarged by considering exotic charged quarks .",
    "it means that some gauge bosons carry lepton and baryon quantum number .",
    "although this model coincides at low energies with the sm it explains some fundamental questions that are accommodated , but not explained , in the sm .",
    "these questions are :    _ i ) _ the family number must be a multiple of three in order to cancel anomalies  @xcite .",
    "this result comes from the fact that the model is anomaly - free only if we have equal number of triplets and antitriplets , counting the @xmath5 colors , and further more requiring the sum of all fermion charges to vanish .",
    "however each generation is anomalous , the anomaly cancellation occurs for the three , or multiply of three , together and not generation by generation like in the sm .",
    "this may provides a first step towards answering the flavor question .",
    "_ ii ) _ why @xmath6 is observed .",
    "this point come from the fact that in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite we have that the @xmath7 and @xmath8 coupling constants , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , are related by @xmath11 hence , this 3 - 3 - 1 model predicts that there exists an energy scale , say @xmath12 , at which the model loses its perturbative character .",
    "the value of @xmath12 can be found through the condition @xmath13 .",
    "however , it is not clear at all what is the value of @xmath12 ; in fact , it has been argued that the upper limit on the vector bilepton masses is 3.5 tev  @xcite instead of the 600 gev given in ref .",
    "any way , the important point is that in this model the `` hierarchy problem '' i.e. , the existence of quite different mass scales , is less severe than in the sm , and its extensions , since now no arbitrary mass scale can be introduced in the model .",
    "hence , in this supersymmetric 3 - 3 - 1 model ( thereafter called 3 - 3 - 1s for short ) it is natural that supersymmetry is broken at the tev scale this is very important because one of the motivation for supersymmetry is that it can help to understand the hierarchy problem : if it is broken at the tev scale . notwithstanding , in the context of the sm it is necessary to assume that the breakdown of supersymmetry happens at the tev scale . however , other 3 - 3 - 1 models i , e . , with different representation content , have different upper limit for the maximal energy scale  @xcite .",
    "_ iii ) _ the quantization of the electric charge is possible even in the sm context .",
    "this is because of the classical ( hypercharge invariance of the yukawa interactions ) and quantum constraints ( anomalies )  @xcite .",
    "however this occurs only family by family and if there is no right - handed neutrinos ( neutrinos if massive must be majorana fields ) ; or , when the three families are considered together the quantization of the electric charge is possible only if right - handed neutrinos with majorana mass term are introduced  @xcite or another higgs doublet  @xcite or some neutral fermions  @xcite are introduced .",
    "on the other hand , in the 3 - 3 - 1 model  @xcite the charge quantization in the three families case does not depend if neutrinos are massless or massive particles  @xcite .    _",
    "iv ) _ in the context of the sm with only one generation , as in the previous item , both classical and quantum constraints imply that the quantization of the charge and the vectorial nature of the electromagnetic charge arise together . when right - handed neutrinos are added there is no charge quantization but the vectorial nature of electromagnetic interactions survives .",
    "both of them are restored if neutrinos are majorana particles  @xcite . in the three generation case neutrinos",
    "ought to be also majorana particles in order to retain both features of the electromagnetic interactions  @xcite . on the other hand , in all sort of 3 - 3 - 1 models the quantization of the charge and the vectorial nature of the electromagnetic interactions",
    "are related one to another and are also independent of the nature of the neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "last but not least , _",
    "v ) _ if we accept the criterion that particle symmetries are determined by the known leptonic sector , and if each generation is treated separately , then @xmath8 is the largest chiral symmetry group to be considered among @xmath14 .",
    "the lepton family quantum number is gauged ; only the total lepton number , @xmath15 , remains a global quantum number ( or equivalently we can define @xmath16 as the global conserved quantum number where @xmath17 is the baryonic number  @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if right - handed neutrinos do exist , as it appears to be the case  @xcite , the symmetry among @xmath18 would be @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "this is possibly the last symmetry among leptons .",
    "there is no room for @xmath20 if we restrict ourselves to the case of leptons with electric charges @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "hence , in this case all versions of the 3 - 3 - 1 model , for instance the one in refs .",
    "@xcite , and the one in refs .",
    "@xcite , are different @xmath8-projections of the larger @xmath22 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "besides the characteristic features given above , which we can consider predictions of the model , the model has some interesting phenomenological consequences : a ) an extended version of some 3 - 3 - 1 models solve the strong cp problem .",
    "it was shown by pal  @xcite that in 3 - 3 - 1 models  @xcite the more general yukawa couplings admit a peccei - quinn symmetry  @xcite and that symmetry can be extended to the higgs potential and , therefore , making it a symmetry of the entire lagrangian .",
    "this is obtained by introducing extra higgs scalar multiplets transforming under the 3 - 3 - 1 symmetry as @xmath23 , for the model of refs .",
    "@xcite , or @xmath24 , for the model of refs .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    "the resulting axion can be made invisible .",
    "the interesting thing is that in those sort of models the peccei - quinn symmetry is an automatic symmetry , in the sense that it does not have to be imposed separately on the lagrangian but it is a consequence of the gauge symmetry and a discrete symmetry .",
    "b ) there exist new contributions to the neutrinoless double beta decay in models with three scalar triplets  @xcite or in the model with the sextet  @xcite . if the model is extended with a neutral scalar singlet it is possible to have a safe majoron - like goldstone boson and there are also contributions to that decay with majoron emission  @xcite .",
    "c ) it is the simplest model that includes bileptons of both types : scalar and vector ones .",
    "in fact , although there are several models which include doubly charged scalar fields , not many of them incorporate doubly charged vector bosons : this is a particularity of the 3 - 3 - 1 model of refs .",
    "d ) the model has several sources of cp violation . in the 3 - 3 - 1",
    "model  @xcite we can implement the violation of the cp symmetry , spontaneously  @xcite or explicitly  @xcite . in models with exotic leptons",
    "it is possible to implement soft cp violation  @xcite .",
    "e ) the extra neutral vector boson @xmath25 conserves flavor in the leptonic but not in the quark sector .",
    "the couplings to the leptons are leptophobic because of the suppression factor @xmath26 but with some quarks there are enhancements because of the factor @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "f ) although the minimal scalar sector of the model is rather complicated , with at least three triplets , we would like to stress that it contains all extension of the electroweak standard model with extra scalar fields : two or more doublets  @xcite , neutral gauge singlet  @xcite , or doubly charged scalar fields  @xcite , or a combination of all that .",
    "however , some couplings which are allowed in the multi - higgs extensions are not in the present model when we consider an @xmath28 subgroup .",
    "inversely , there are some interactions that are allowed in the present models that are not in the multi - higgs extensions of the sm , for instance , trilinear couplings among the doublets which have no analog in the sm , or even the in mssm .",
    "it means that the model preserves the memory of the 3 - 3 - 1 original symmetry .",
    "hence , in our opinion , the large higgs sector is not an intrinsic trouble of this model .",
    "g ) even if we restrict ourselves to leptons of charge @xmath29 we can have exotic neutral  @xcite or charged heavy leptons  @xcite .",
    "h ) neutrinos can gain majorana masses if we allow one of the neutral components of the scalar sextet to gain a non - zero vacuum expectation value  @xcite , or if we introduce right - handed neutrinos  @xcite , or if we add either terms in the scalar potential that break the total lepton number or an extra charged lepton transforming as singlet under the 3 - 3 - 1 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "of course , some of the goodness of this type of models , like that in items _ i _ ) , _ ii _ ) and _ iv _ ) above , can be considered only as a hint to the final resolution of those problems : they depend on the representation content and we can always ask ourselves what is the main principle behind the representation content . anyway , we think that the 3 - 3 - 1 models have interesting features by themselves and that it is well motivated to generalize them by introducing supersymmetry . in the present paper we built exhaustively the supersymmetric version of the 3 - 3 - 1 model of refs .  @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sm ] we present the representation content of the supersymmetric 3 - 3 - 1 model .",
    "we build the lagrangian in sec .  [",
    "sec : lagrangian ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sp ] we analyze the scalar potential , in particular , we found the mass spectrum of the neutral scalar and shown that the lightest scalar field has an upper limit of 124.5 gev .",
    "our conclusion are in the last section .",
    "the fact that in the 3 - 3 - 1 model of refs .",
    "@xcite we have the constraint at tree level @xmath30 means , as we said before , that the model predicts that there exists an energy scale , say @xmath12 , at which the model loses its perturbative character . thus in that model the `` hierarchy problem '' i.e. , the existence of quite different mass scales , is less severe than in the standard model and its extensions since no arbitrary mass scale can be introduced in the model .",
    "this feature remains valid when we introduce supersymmetry in the model .",
    "thus , the breaking of the supersymmetry occurs in a natural way also at the tev scale in this 3 - 3 - 1 model .",
    "some aspects of the supersymmetric 3 - 3 - 1 model have been already considered in refs .",
    "@xcite and we will comment on later .",
    "however , let us first consider the particle content of the model without supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "we have the leptons transforming as @xmath31 in parenthesis it appears the transformations properties under the respective factors @xmath32 .",
    "we have not introduced right - handed neutrinos and for the moment we assume here that the neutrinos are massless , however see  @xcite .    in the quark sector ,",
    "one quark family is also put in the triplet representation @xmath33 and the respective singlets are given by @xmath34 writing all the fields as left - handed .",
    "the others two quark generations we put in the antitriplet representation @xmath35 and also with the respective singlets , @xmath36    on the other hand , the scalars which are necessary to generate the fermion masses are @xmath37 and one way to obtain an arbitrary mass matrix for the leptons is to introduce the following symmetric anti - sextet @xmath38    now , we introduce the minimal set of particles in order to implement the supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "we have the sleptons corresponding to the leptons in eq .",
    "( [ trip ] ) ; squarks related to the quarks in eqs.([q1r])-([q23r ] ) ; and the higgsinos related to the scalars given in eqs .",
    "( [ 3 t ] ) and ( [ sextet ] ) .",
    "besides , in order to to cancel chiral anomalies generated by the superpartners of the scalars , we have to add the following higgsinos in the respective anti - multiplets ,    [ escac ] @xmath39 @xmath40    there are also the scalar partners of the higgsinos defined in eq .",
    "( [ escac ] ) and we will denote them @xmath41 .",
    "this is the particle content which we will consider as the minimal 3 - 3 - 1s model if the charged lepton masses are generated by the sextet @xmath42 .",

    "besides the constraint equations ( appendix [ sec : a3 ] ) and imposing the positivity of the eigenvalues ( mass square ) , and the values for the parameters given above we obtain the following values for the masses of the scalar sector ( in gev ) @xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 with @xmath159 . in the pseudoscalar sector we have verified analytically that the mass matrix in the appendix  [ sec : a2 ] , has two goldstone bosons as it should .",
    "the other six physical pseudoscalars have the following masses , with the same parameters as before , in gev , @xmath160 .    the behavior of the lightest scalar ( @xmath161)and pseudoscalar ( @xmath162 ) as a function of @xmath163 is shown in fig .  1 for a given choice of the parameters",
    ", we see that , at the tree level , there is an upper limit for the mass of the lightest scalar : @xmath164 gev and that for these values of the parameters @xmath165 .",
    "other values of the parameters give higher or lower values for the upper limit of @xmath166 .",
    "of course , radiative corrections have to be taken into account , however , this has to be done in the context of the supersymmetric 3 - 3 - 1 model which is not in the scope of the present work .",
    "hence the mass square of the lightest real scalar boson has an upper bound ( see fig .",
    "1 ) @xmath167 where 124.5 gev is the tree value ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "we recall that in the mssm if @xmath165 the upper limit on the mass of the lightest neutral scalar is @xmath169 at the tree level but radiative corrections rise it to 130 gev  @xcite .",
    "we have built the complete supersymmetric version of the 3 - 3 - 1 model of refs .",
    "another possibility in this 3 - 3 - 1 model which avoids the introduction of the scalar sextet , @xmath42 , was considered some years ago by duong and ma , ref .",
    "@xcite , who built the supersymmetric version of that model .",
    "the sextet was substituted by a single charged lepton singlet @xmath170 and @xmath171 . here",
    "we would like to point out the differences between our version of the supersymmetric 3 - 3 - 1 model and that of ref .",
    "a ) * duong and ma assumed that the breaking of @xmath172 occurred before the breaking of supersymmetry and the resulting model is a supersymmetric @xmath173 model .",
    "even , in this case the scalar potential involving doublets of the residual gauge symmetry do not coincide with the potential of the mssm . in the present work",
    ", we have considered that the supersymmetry is broken at the same time that the 3 - 3 - 1 gauge symmetry .",
    "hence , we have to consider the complete 3 - 3 - 1 scalar potential .",
    "it means that in the duong and ma supersymmetric model there are no doubly charged charginos and exotic charged squarks . * b ) * in ref .",
    "@xcite it was assumed that some of the vevs have zero value , unlikely we have considered all ( but @xmath174 and @xmath175 ) of them different from zero .",
    "hence we are able to obtain realistic quark and charged lepton masses , as can be seen from eqs.([qumm ] ) , ( [ qdmm ] ) and ( [ qjmm ] ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite some of these masses have to be generated by radiative corrections  @xcite . from a ) and b ) we see that the 3 - 3 - 1 supersymmetric model considered in this work has different phenomenological features from the supersymmetric 3 - 3 - 1 model of duong and ma .    from the phenomenological point of view",
    "there are several possibilities .",
    "since it is possible to define the @xmath108-parity symmetry , the phenomenology of this model with @xmath108-parity conserved has similar features to that of the @xmath108-conserving mssm : the supersymmetric particles are pair - produced and the lightest neutralino is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
    "the mass spectra of all particles in this model will be considered elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "however , there are differences between this model and the mssm with or without @xmath108-parity breaking : due to the fact that there are doubly charged scalar and vector fields .",
    "hence , we have doubly charged charginos which are mixtures of the superpartners of the @xmath176-vector boson with the doubly charged higgsinos .",
    "this implies new interactions that are not present in the mssm , for instance : @xmath177 , @xmath178 , @xmath179 where @xmath180 denotes any doubly charged chargino .",
    "moreover , in the chargino production , besides the usual mechanism , we have additional contributions coming from the @xmath176-bilepton in the s - channel . due to this fact we expect that there will be an enhancement in the cross section of production of these particles in @xmath181 collisors , such as the nlc  @xcite .",
    "we will also have the singly charged charginos and neutralinos , as in the mssm , where there are processes like @xmath182 , @xmath183 , with @xmath184 denoting any slepton ; @xmath185 denotes singly charged chargino and @xmath186 denotes any sneutrino .",
    "the only difference is that in the mssm there are five neutralinos and in the 3 - 3 - 1s model there are eight neutralinos .",
    "finally , we would like to call attention that , whatever the energy scale @xmath12 at which @xmath13 is in the non - supersymmetric 3 - 3 - 1 model , when supersymmetry is added it will result a rather different value for @xmath12 . in conclusion",
    ", we can say that the present model has a rich phenomenology that deserves to be studied more in detail .",
