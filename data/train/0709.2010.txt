    "introduced by anosov and smale in the 1960 s , uniform hyperbolicity is at the core of dynamical system theory .",
    "the corresponding systems are well - understood since in particular the works of sinai , bowen and ruelle ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and it is now a central challenge to try to extend our understanding beyond these systems @xcite .",
    "we propose that robust entropy conditions provide a way to do this for new open sets of dynamical systems , by implying a non - uniform but global hyperbolic structure , especially with respect to measures maximizing entropy ( see section [ sec - defs ] for definitions ) .",
    "such invariant probability measures can be thought as describing the `` complexity '' of the dynamics .",
    "these measures exist as soon as the dynamics is compact and @xmath0 @xcite or somewhat hyperbolic @xcite , though they are known to fail to exist in finite smoothness for interval maps @xcite and diffeomorphisms of four dimensional tori @xcite .",
    "uniqueness problems are usually much more delicate and can be solved only after a global analysis of the dynamics which we propose to do under entropy conditions .",
    "_ entropy - expansion _ is such a condition .",
    "it requires the topological entropy ( see section [ sec - defs ] ) to be strictly larger than the supremum of the topological entropies of all smooth hypersurfaces .",
    "it is robust in the sense that it is open in the @xmath0 topology .",
    "entropy - expanding @xmath0 maps @xmath1 have a finite number of ergodic and invariant probability measures maximizing the entropy .",
    "their periodic points satisfy a * multiplicative lower bound * : @xmath2 for some integer @xmath3 ( a period ) ( see @xcite for precise definitions and statements including other results ) .",
    "entropy - expansion is satisfied by plane maps of the type @xmath4 for small @xmath5 @xcite . on the interval",
    ", the condition reduces to nonzero topological entropy .",
    "in fact , entropy - expansion can be understood as a generalization of some aspects of one - dimensional dynamics .",
    "indeed , the previous results were first proved by hofbauer @xcite for piecewise monotone maps on the interval and our approach has built on his techniques .",
    "the techniques used in the above mentioned papers do not apply to diffeomorphisms ( e.g. , a diffeomorphism is never entropy - expanding ) . however , many properties of interval maps generalize to surface diffeomorphisms so the following is generally expected :    consider a @xmath6 diffeomorphism ( @xmath7 ) of a compact surface with nonzero topological entropy .",
    "the collection of ergodic and invariant probability measures with maximal entropy is * countable * ( possibly finite or empty ) and the periodic points satisfy a multiplicative lower bound if there exists at least one measure with maximum entropy .",

    "the collection of ergodic and invariant probability measures with maximum entropy is * finite * and the periodic points satisfy a multiplicative lower bound .    by a result of s. newhouse @xcite ,",
    "all @xmath0 maps of compact manifolds have at least one measure of maximum entropy .",
    "also a classical theorem of a. katok @xcite states that , if @xmath9 is a @xmath6 , @xmath7 , diffeomorphism of a compact surface @xmath10 , then the number of periodic points satisfies a * logarithmic lower bound * : @xmath11 i.e. , a weak version of ( [ eq : mult - bound ] ) .",
    "this paper presents the proof of the analogue of conjecture 2 in the easier case of piecewise affine homeomorphisms .",
    "this replaces distortion of smooth diffeomorphisms by the singularities of the piecewise affine maps .",
    "however this preserves substantial difficulties .",
    "indeed , there exist piecewise affine maps on surfaces without a maximum measure ( see appendix [ sec - examples ] , though the examples i know are discontinuous or continuous but piecewise quadratic ) or with infinitely many maximum measures ( see also appendix [ sec - examples ] ) .",
    "thus this setting , beyond its own interest as a simple and rather natural class of dynamics , is challenging enough to allow the development of new tools which we hope will apply to diffeomorphisms .",
    "let @xmath10 be a compact two - dimensional manifold possibly with boundary , * affine * in the following sense .",
    "there exists a distinguished atlas of charts :    * identifying the neighborhood of any point of @xmath10 with an open subset of @xmath12 ; * inducing affine changes of coordinates .",
    "these charts are called the _",
    "affine charts_. the phenomena we are considering are independent of the global topology , so we could in fact restrict ourselves to the special cases @xmath13 or @xmath14 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "a continuous map @xmath1 is said to be * piecewise affine * if there exists a finite partition @xmath15 of @xmath10 such that for every @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are contained in affine charts which map them to polygons of @xmath19 with non - empty interiors and @xmath20 is affine w.r.t .",
    "these affine charts .",

    "such a partition @xmath21 ( a partition up to the boundaries of its elements ) is called an * admissible partition * with respect to @xmath9 .",
    "we drop the tilde in the sequel .",
    "let us recall some facts about entropy ( we refer to @xcite for further information ) .",
    "the entropy of a non - necessarily invariant subset @xmath22 is a measure of the `` number of orbits '' starting from @xmath23 .",
    "recall that the * @xmath24-ball * at @xmath25 is : @xmath26 @xmath27 .",

    "the * topological entropy * is @xmath30 .",
    "the entropy of an ergodic and invariant probability measure @xmath31 can be defined similarly , according to @xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the minimal number of @xmath24-balls whose union has a @xmath31-measure at least @xmath34 , for a constant @xmath35 ( @xmath36 is independent of @xmath34 ) .",
    "the * variational principle * states that for @xmath1 ( in fact for any continuous self - map of a compact metric space @xcite ) : @xmath37 where @xmath31 ranges over the @xmath9-invariant and ergodic probability measures .",

    "[ prop - ms ] let @xmath9 be a piecewise affine homeomorphism of a compact surface .",

    "misiurewicz and szlenk @xcite established the same formula for piecewise monotone maps of the intervals .    the proof is given in sec .",
    "[ sec - sd ] .    the variational principle ( [ eqvarprin ] ) brings to the fore the ergodic and invariant probability measures @xmath31 such that @xmath39 .",

    ".    a piecewise affine homeomorphism of a compact surface has at least one maximum measure .",
    "our main result , finally established in sec .",
    "[ sec - main - thm ] , is :    [ thm - max - ent ] let @xmath1 be a piecewise affine homeomorphism of a compact affine surface .",
    "assume that @xmath40 .",
    "then there are finitely many ergodic , invariant probability measures maximizing the entropy ( or maximum measures ) .",

    "we use an alternative approach to the explicit construction of markov partitions .",
    "we ask less of geometry and use more combinatorics , ergodic theory and entropy estimates to accommodate the resulting non - uniqueness of representation .",
    "more precisely , we build small rectangles admitting many returns with `` good properties '' which allows the construction of a jump transformation and establish _ semi - uniform estimates _ , that is , uniform estimates holding on subsets of measures that are lower bounded w.r.t .  any large entropy measure .",
    "the finite number of maximum measures for the jump transformation follows from results of b.m .",
    "gurevi on countable state markov shifts . however , the jump transformation is not a first return map to an _ a priori _ defined good set .",
    "hence , a careful study of the relation between the jump transformation and the original dynamics is needed to conclude that the maximum measures of both systems can be identified .",
    "in fact , we analyze more generally _ large entropy measures _ , i.e. , invariant and ergodic probability measures with entropy close enough to the supremum .",
    "let us outline the proof .",
    "we start in section [ sec - pointwise ] by introducing the natural _ symbolic dynamics _ of the piecewise affine map using the partition defined by the singularities of @xmath9 .",
    "we first show that this symbolic dynamics has the same entropy as @xmath9 .",
    "this is both a significant result and a fundamental step in our approach .",
    "we then establish that the _ ( local ) stable @xmath46 and unstable @xmath47 manifolds _ of points @xmath25 , i.e. , the sets of points with the same past or future w.r.t .",
    "the partition @xmath15 , are line segments outside of an entropy - negligible subset .",
    "these line segments can be arbitrarily short and their length may vary discontinuously .",
    "however , we prove semi - uniform lower bounds for their lengths and angles , using the conditional entropy w.r.t .",
    "the past or the future .",
    "a corollary of these bounds is that the boundary of the partition is negligible w.r.t .",
    "all ergodic invariant probability measures with nonzero entropy .",
    "at this point , one would like to conclude by an argument of the following type .",
    "if there was a large number of maximum measures , then one could find two of them , both giving positive measure to a set @xmath48 of points with local stable and unstable manifolds much larger than the diameter of @xmath48 .",
    "hence , one could `` jump '' back and forth between typical orbits of each of the two measures .",
    "but one could expect such mixing to allow the construction of a measure with greater entropy , a contradiction .",
    "however , establishing the increase in entropy seems to require too fine estimates ( of a multiplicative , rather than logarithmic type ) .",
    "we are thus lead to build a jump transformation with markov properties which will reduce the problem to loop counting on a graph , for which these fine estimates exist ( and , indeed , the uniqueness of the maximum measure has been established in this setting by b.m .",
    "gurevi , see below ) .    section [ sec - markov - struct ] is devoted to building a markov structure representing the large entropy dynamics .",
    "we first build arrays of _ markov rectangles _ which contain a significant proportion of the dynamics .",
    "these are approximate rectangles in the sense they contain open subsets of points with local manifolds that do nt cross ( `` holes '' in the local product structure ) .",
    "however we can ensure that the relative measure of such points in very small .",
    "our techniques require however replacing @xmath9 by some high power @xmath49 .",
    "we then define hyperbolic strips following the geometric picture of markov rectangles usual in uniformly hyperbolic dynamics .",
    "we provide tools to build many such strips around typical orbits of large entropy measures , using visits to the markov rectangles while the stable and unstable manifolds are both `` rather large '' .",
    "these hyperbolic strips are markov in the sense that they can be freely concatenated as soon as they end and begin in the same rectangle .",
    "however , to get a useful markov representation from this , one needs an invariant way of `` cutting '' typical orbits into concatenations of such hyperbolic strips .",
    "a fundamental difficulty arises here : there exist incompatible decompositions , i.e. , which do not admit a common refinement",
    ". there does not seem to be an _ a priori _ natural set the visits to which could be used to defined invariantly the above `` cutting . ''",
    "we conclude section [ sec - markov - struct ] by selecting among hyperbolic strips a subset of _ admissible _ ones to get uniqueness in the decomposition of _ forward _ orbits ( this weak uniqueness will require a more detailed ergodic analysis in section [ sec - lifting ] ) . we obtain a notion of _ good return times _ and a markov structure .",
    "the more technical section [ sec - good - returns ] relates the good return times to geometric and combinatorial properties involving the visits to the markov rectangles and their holes .",
    "it is shown that large entropy measures can not have too large average good return time .",
    "finally , section [ sec - lifting ] proves the main results .",
    "we lift large entropy measures of @xmath9 to the jump transformations as finite extensions .",
    "using that the latter is isomorphic to a countable state markov shift , a result of gurevic @xcite allows to conclude the proof of the theorem .",
    "proposition [ prop - periodic ] rests on a classical estimate of vere - jones @xcite on the number of loops of countable oriented graphs together with a combinatorial argument to transfer this estimate to periodic points of @xmath9 .",
    "proposition [ prop : lsc - entropy ] , the possibility of approximating in entropy of the whole map by a compact set away from the singularity set , follows from a similar property of countable state markov shifts : they are approximated in entropy by finite state markov shifts according to gurevi .",
    "there are three appendices : ( a ) recalls some facts about measure - theoretic entropy , ( b ) proves a lifting theorem for the tower defined by a return time and ( c ) gives some examples of piecewise affine maps .",
    "the results presented here allow the analysis of the maximal entropy measures of a simple and natural class of dynamics by representing them by countable state markov shifts .",
    "along the same lines , one can probably make the representation more precise to get further results , for instance :    * classification by the topological entropy and periods up to isomorphisms modulo entropy - negligible subsets @xcite ; * precise counting of isolated periodic points , e.g. , existence of a meromorphic extension of the artin - mazur zeta function like in @xcite ; * uniqueness of the maximal entropy measure under a transitivity assumption and/or a bound on the number of maximum measures in terms of the cardinality of the partition @xmath15 .    in a slightly different direction , one would like to understand the nature of the symbolic dynamics of piecewise affine surface homeomorphisms ( see sec . [ sec - sd ] ) .",
    "is there a tractable class of subshifts containing these symbolic dynamics , i.e. , a class that would do for piecewise affine surface homeomorphisms what subshifts of quasi - finite type @xcite do for piecewise monotone interval maps ?",
    "it would also be natural to apply the techniques of this paper to more general dynamics .",
    "first , piecewise homographic surface homeomorphisms can be analyzed in the same way .",
    "then one could try to analyze other general classes of piecewise affine maps , especially in higher dimensions ( e.g. , uniformly expanding maps or entropy - expanding maps or entropy - hyperbolic homeomorphisms @xcite ) .",
    "most questions are still open despite some partial results ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and we should stress that new problems immediately appear . from the point of view of entropy alone :    * there exist piecewise affine continuous _ maps _ on surfaces and piecewise affine homeomorphisms in _ dimension 3 _ for which the right hand side of ( [ eq - ms ] ) is strictly larger than the entropy ( see examples [ ex - pw - d2-mult ] , [ ex - pw - d3-mult ] in the appendix [ sec - examples ] ) ; * example [ ex - pw - d2-max ] in appendix [ sec - examples ] is a piecewise affine _ discontinuous map _ on a surface with no maximum measure ( one can give a continuous , piecewise quadratic version of it , see example [ ex - c0-q - d2-max ] ) .",
    "however , i do nt know examples of continuous piecewise affine maps without maximum measures .    for diffeomorphisms , the main difficulty with our approach is to find a link between short stable / unstable manifolds and small entropy ,",
    "e.g. , one would need to relate small lyapunov charts to entropy bounds for a smooth diffeomorphism .",
    "an analysis of @xmath50 surface diffeomorphisms with nonzero topological entropy with dominated splitting is in preparation .",
    "i would like to thank the anonymous referees for many remarks which have significantly improved the exposition .",
    "we define a symbolic dynamics for the map @xmath9 using some admissible partition @xmath15 , that is , a finite collection of disjoint open polygons with dense union . a key step is showing that @xmath51 has zero measure w.r.t .",
    "any @xmath52 , where @xmath53 denotes the set of ergodic , invariant probability measures of @xmath9 with @xmath54 .",
    "[ def : ds ] let @xmath15 be an admissible partition .",

    "the * symbolic dynamics * of @xmath59 is : @xmath60 endowed with the shift map : @xmath61 .",
    "a standard result ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) states that since @xmath62 is a subshift , it admits at least one maximal entropy measure .",
    "hence , a `` close enough '' relation between the invariant measures of @xmath62 and @xmath9 will imply existence of a maximum measure also for @xmath9 . by the variational principle",
    ", we shall also get that @xmath9 and @xmath62 have the same topological entropy . the misiurewicz - szlenk formula for @xmath9 will then follow .",
    "indeed , for a subshift like @xmath62 , the topological entropy is computed by counting the _ cylinders _ , @xmath63:=\\{x\\in\\sigma : x_0\\dots x_{n-1}=a_0\\dots a_{n-1}\\}$ ] , that is : @xmath64\\ne\\emptyset : a\\in p^n\\}.\\ ] ]    neither @xmath9 nor its symbolic dynamics is an extension of the other in general , hence it is convenient to introduce the following common extension : @xmath65    the close relation between the measures of @xmath9 and @xmath62 alluded to above is :    [ lem - ext - ent ] both maps @xmath66 and @xmath67 are entropy preserving : for every invariant probability measure @xmath31 on @xmath68 , @xmath69 . moreover , @xmath70 and @xmath71 induce onto maps between the sets of ( ergodic ) invariant probability measures .    in particular , the topological entropies of the three systems are equal by the variational principle recalled in eq .",
    "( [ eqvarprin ] ) .",
    "the proof of the above lemma rests on two geometric / combinatorial properties .",
    "the first is the following observation by s. newhouse , very specific of our setting ( it is false in higher dimensions or without the invertibility assumption , see the appendix ) :    [ lem - mult - ent ] the * multiplicity entropy * @xcite : @xmath72 is zero for any piecewise affine homeomorphism of a surface .",
    "the second is a property of linear maps :    [ lem - compos - lin ] let @xmath73 . for each @xmath74 ,",
