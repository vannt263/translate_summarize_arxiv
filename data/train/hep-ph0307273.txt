    "sufficiently cold and dense quark matter is a color superconductor @xcite .",
    "the corresponding ground state is characterized by a condensate of cooper pairs made of quarks . since the latter carry color charge ,",
    "the su(3)@xmath1 color gauge group of strong interactions is partially or completely broken through the anderson - higgs mechanism . at asymptotic densities ,",
    "this phenomenon was studied from first principles in refs .",
    "these studies of dense qcd , as well as studies of various phenomenologically motivated models @xcite , suggest that dense quark matter at high baryon density has a very rich phase structure , consisting of many different phases .",
    "it is natural to expect that some color superconducting phases may exist in the interior of compact stars .",
    "the estimated central densities of such stars might be as large as @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 @xmath4 is the saturation density ) , while their temperatures are in the range of tens of kev .",
    "this could provide ideal conditions for the diquark cooper pairing of color superconductivity .",
    "matter in the bulk of compact stars should be neutral with respect to electrical as well as color charges .",
    "also , such matter should remain in @xmath0-equilibrium .",
    "satisfying these requirements may impose nontrivial relations between the chemical potentials of different quarks . in turn",
    ", such relations could substantially influence the pairing dynamics between quarks , for instance , by suppressing some color superconducting phases and by favoring others .",
    "for example , it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the mixture of the 2-flavor color superconducting ( 2sc ) phase and normal strange quarks is less favorable than the color - flavor - locked ( cfl ) phase if the charge neutrality condition is enforced ( note that the strange quark mass was chosen too small to allow the appearance of a pure 2sc phase ) .",
    "a similar conclusion was also reached in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , it was proposed that neutral two - flavor quark matter in @xmath0-equilibrium can have a rather unusual , stable ground state called a gapless color superconductor ( g2sc ) @xcite .",
    "a similar phase of gapless color superconductivity could also appear in strange quark matter when the baryon number density is kept fixed @xcite [ for earlier studies see ref .",
    "@xcite where an unstable gapless phase was considered ] .",
    "this gapless strange quark matter may , in principle , be realized inside the so - called strangelets .",
    "it was also suggested that closely related phases may exist in two component mixtures of cold fermionic atoms @xcite .",
    "it is fair to mention that , in both quark and cold atom systems , the ground state could also be given by some mixed phases @xcite provided the surface tension effects are not too strong .",
    "while the symmetry of the g2sc ground state is the same as that of the conventional 2-flavor color superconductor , the spectrum of the fermionic quasiparticles is different .",
    "in particular , two out of four gaped quasiparticles of the conventional 2sc phase become gapless in the g2sc phase .",
    "in addition , the number densities of the pairing quarks in g2sc at zero temperature are not equal @xcite .",
    "for example , the density of red ( green ) up quarks is different from the density of green ( red ) down quarks .",
    "this is in contrast to the conventional  enforced \" pairing @xcite where the corresponding densities are equal .",
    "it is possible that the g2sc quark matter exists inside central regions of compact stars",
    ". this would be quite natural since this phase of matter is neutral with respect to electrical and color charges , and satisfies the @xmath0-equilibrium condition by construction .",
    "also , this phase is more stable than normal quark matter under similar conditions @xcite . while suggestive , these arguments alone are not sufficient to make a conclusive statement regarding the chances of the g2sc phase to appear inside stars . in order to study this issue properly",
    ", one should consider the competition of the g2sc phase with all other possible phases of quark / hadronic matter .",
    "however , the limited knowledge of the strongly coupled dynamics in qcd at realistic densities does not allow such a systematic quantitative study .    in this paper , we study properties of the g2sc phase at finite temperature .",
    "our interest in such properties is driven by the expectation that the g2sc phase of quark matter may already appear at a relatively early ( protoneutron ) stage of the compact star evolution when the temperature of the stellar core is quite high .",
    "if this is the case , the knowledge of finite temperature properties of quark matter would be needed to understand the stellar properties and , possibly , even to predict observational signatures of the new state of matter inside stars .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we set our notation by presenting a model of quark matter , and spell out the main assumptions in the analysis .",
    "then , in sec .  [ t=0 ]",
    "we discuss in detail the solution to the gap equation and the condition of the charge neutrality in the two - flavor quark model at zero temperature .",
    "in addition to reproducing the numerical results of our original short letter @xcite , we also present many analytical results that have not been included in ref .",
    "@xcite . at zero temperature ,",
    "the screening properties of gluons in the g2sc phase , as well as the possible appearance of two additional spin-1 condensates , are deduced from the qualitative nature of the low energy spectrum of quasiparticles .",
    "the finite temperature properties of the g2sc phase are studied in sec .",
    "[ finite - t ] . among main results",
    ", we find that ( i ) the phase transition between the g2sc phase and normal quark matter is a second order phase transition , ( ii ) the ratio of the critical temperature and the zero temperature gap is not a universal number in the gapless phase , and ( iii ) a nonzero finite temperature gap may appear even if its zero temperature value is vanishing .",
    "[ conclusion ] contains our conclusions and a brief discussion of the properties of the g2sc phase as well as their applications .",
    "let us start our analysis by discussing the quark model that we use in the following .",
    "we assume that the strange quark is sufficiently heavy and does not appear at intermediate baryon densities under consideration ( e.g. , this might correspond to the quark chemical potential @xmath5 in the range between about @xmath6 and @xmath7 mev ) .",

    "the quark field @xmath11 is a four - component dirac spinor that carries flavor ( @xmath12 ) and color ( @xmath13 ) indices .",
    "the pauli matrices are denoted by @xmath14 , while @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the antisymmetric tensors in the flavor and color spaces , respectively .",
    "we also introduce a momentum cutoff @xmath17 , and two independent coupling constants in the scalar quark - antiquark and scalar diquark channels , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the values of the parameters in the njl model are chosen by fitting the pion decay constant @xmath20 mev and the chiral condensate @xmath21 mev . in the case of @xmath22 , the additional parameter",
    "could also be fixed by fitting the value of the pion mass . in the rest of this paper , however , we consider only the chiral limit with @xmath23 . then the two model parameters , i.e. , the coupling constant and the cutoff , are chosen as follows : @xmath24 gev@xmath25 and @xmath26 mev @xcite . without loss of generality , we set the strength of the diquark coupling @xmath19 to be proportional to the quark - antiquark coupling constant , i.e. , @xmath27 with a typical number for @xmath28 being around @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "when considering the chiral limit in the following , we shall find that the constituent quark mass is zero in the model at hand in the g2sc phase .",
    "in reality , however , this may not be the case . at the same time , since the appearance of the g2sc phase is a fermi surface phenomenon , our assumption should not be a strong limitation . of course , nonzero quark masses should affect the fermi momenta of different quark species . in turn , this could change slightly the mismatch parameter @xmath30 in our model ( see below ) , and introduce some minor changes in the analysis @xcite . however , to large extent , the results would not change .",

    "also , around @xmath175 , the gaped ( double - degenerate ) quasiparticle resembles the ( double - degenerate ) quasiparticle with larger value of the gap in the 2sc phase .",

    "indeed , this model should be adequate for getting an insight into the pairing dynamics of quarks and into some thermodynamic properties of quark matter .",
    "however , the njl model lacks gluons . as reflection of this , it possesses the global instead of gauged color symmetry .",

    "perhaps , the njl model can be thought of as the low energy theory of qcd in which the gluons , as independent degrees of freedom , are integrated out .",
    "the gluons could be reintroduced back by gauging the color symmetry in the lagrangian density in eq .",
    "( [ lagr ] ) , providing a semirigorous framework for studying the effect of the cooper pairing on the physical properties of gluons .",

    "a similar quantitative analysis could also be performed in the case of a nonzero mismatch parameter @xmath30 . technically , this is not easy , and it is left for a future study . here",
    "we argue , nevertheless , that some basic properties of gluons could be understood even without such an explicit calculation .    at large densities ,",
    "gluons become quasiparticles with rather complicated dispersion relations . typically , the only propagating ( i.e. , weakly damped ) modes of gluons in dense medium",
    "are plasmons ( see , however , ref .",
    "@xcite where other interesting modes of dense quark matter are discussed ) .",
    "as in the case of metals , the minimum value of the frequency of plasmons is called the plasma frequency . since",
    "its value in dense quark matter is of order @xmath184 , the plasmons could be viewed as `` high energy '' modes that exist not only in the normal phase , but also in the 2sc and g2sc phases .",
    "the reason is that the properties of these high energy modes should not change much by the modification of the low energy quasiparticle spectra in broken phases .",
    "it is clear that the gluon self - energy carries information not only about the propagating modes , but also about highly damped modes and various screening effects .",
    "the meissner effect and the debye screening are among them .",
    "it is important to mention that these types of large distance scale properties are determined to large extent by the low energy excitations .",
    "therefore , they are very sensitive to the ( dis-)appearance of gaps in quasiparticle spectra .",
    "first , let us discuss the debye screening which is the property of the gluons of the electric type ( i.e. , spatially longitudinal gluons ) . in the case of the 2sc phase ,",
    "this is studied in ref .",
    "it is shown that the three gluons of the unbroken @xmath71 , unlike the other five gluons of the original @xmath185 , do _ not _ experience the debye screening in the far infrared region .",
    "this is the consequence of the absence of gapless quasiparticles in the 2sc ground state that interact with the gluons of the unbroken @xmath71 .",
    "now , this property is no longer valid in the gapless phase studied here .",
    "one should expect , therefore , that all gluons of the original @xmath185 are subject to the debye screening .",
    "of course , the values of the debye masses for different gluons need not be the same .",
    "a similar line of arguments may also be given in relation to the meissner effect that affects five magnetic gluons ( i.e. , spatially transverse gluons ) .",
    "in this case , it is the appearance of a nonzero gap that leads usually to meissner masses for the gluons @xcite .",
    "we remind that the three gluons of the unbroken @xmath71 do not experience the meissner effect .",
    "it is reasonable to suggest that , even with a nonzero mismatch parameter , five magnetic gluons in the 2sc phase ( @xmath186 ) should still experience the meissner effect . indeed",
    ", all those quasiparticles that were gaped at @xmath187 still remain gaped .    in the case of the g2sc phase ( @xmath188 ) , there appear gapless quasiparticles in the low energy sector of the theory , see fig .",
    "[ g2sc - quasi ] .",
    "if the value of the quantity @xmath189 is not vanishingly small , the low energy excitations ( @xmath190 ) in the g2sc phase look similar to the excitations in the normal phase in which the values of the chemical potentials are shifted slightly .",
    "moreover , even the values of the density of states at the corresponding `` effective '' fermi surfaces , i.e. , at @xmath176 and @xmath177 , remain similar . by making use of the dispersion relations in eq .",
    "( [ 2-degenerate ] ) , we derive @xmath191 taking this into account , we may conclude that the large distance properties of the magnetic gluons in the g2sc phase should be the same as in the normal phase .",
    "this suggests , in particular , that there is no color meissner effect in such a phase .",
    "this would be very unusual because the diquark gap is nonzero , and the anderson - higgs mechanism is expected to occur .",
    "sometimes , this latter is identified with the meissner effect .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the two effects are not the same .",
    "of course , the anderson - higgs mechanism is realized in the g2sc phase in the following sense .",
    "the five ng bosons , related to the breaking of the global color symmetry , are unphysical in the g2sc phase .",
    "in other words , they are `` eaten '' by the gluons .",
    "this conclusion can be reached by using the gauge freedom in qcd that allows to get rid of the ng bosons ( the corresponding gauge is called unitary ) .    here , it is also instructive to mention that , in contrast to models with unbroken lorentz symmetry , the gauge bosons in dense ( or hot ) medium have propagating ( massive ) longitudinal modes even in the normal phase .",
    "thus , the intuitive picture , being popular in particle physics , that connects the anderson - higgs mechanism with the appearance of nonzero masses for gauge bosons is not directly generalized to dense ( or hot ) medium . in the case of the g2sc phase",
    ", it might not be adequate even when applied to the appearance of the meissner mass for magnetic gluons .",
    "the fact that the low energy fermionic quasiparticles in the g2sc phase look nearly the same as in the normal phase has yet another consequence . as we discuss below , there should appear two additional spin-1 condensates on top of the g2sc ground state . in its turn , this should lead to the opening of small gaps around the points @xmath176 and @xmath177 . thus , strictly speaking , there will be no gapless excitations in the quasiparticle spectrum at zero temperature .    our argument here is based on the following simple observation . around the effective fermi momenta @xmath176 and @xmath177 , the gapless quasiparticles are double degenerate .",
    "this is the reflection of the degeneracy with respect to the red and green colors .",
    "then , by taking into account the high degeneracy of states at @xmath176 and @xmath177 and the attraction in the color antisymmetric channel , we conclude that the cooper instability should develop in the g2sc ground state around both points @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "this instability is removed spontaneously by the appearance of two `` secondary '' condensates of cooper pairs . in view of the pauli principle ,",
    "these are spin-1 condensates of the so - called polar phase .",
    "the spatial rotation symmetry is broken in the presence of such a condensation @xcite .    since spin-1 condensates",
    "are much weaker than the spin-0 condensates , this additional condensations add a fine structure on the background of the g2sc phase .",
    "in practical terms , it means that many thermodynamic quantities , such as the energy density , the pressure and the particle densities should change very little . at the same time , other properties , such as the specific heat , the magnetic field penetration depth and various transport coefficients could be modified considerably by the appearance of the spin-1 condensates .",
    "for example , the presence of these condensates will result in the color as well as electromagnetic meissner effect at sufficiently low temperatures @xcite .    before concluding this subsection",
    ", we would like to mention that an additional spin-1 condensation of the blue up and down quarks is not expected in the model at hand . even if there is an attraction in a flavor antisymmetric channel ( e.g. , provided by instantons ) , the fermi momenta of the blue up and down quarks are badly mismatched .",
    "this is the general outcome of enforcing the @xmath0-equilibrium condition and the local neutrality in nonstrange quark matter .",
    "in this section , we study the properties of the g2sc phase at finite temperature .",
    "as we shall see , the interplay of the neutrality condition and the solution to the gap equation produces many unusual properties of quark matter that have no analogue in well known systems .",
    "one of our most intriguing observation will be that the ratio of the critical temperature to the value of the gap at zero temperature is not a universal number in the g2sc phase .",
    "in fact , depending on the coupling constant , this ratio could be arbitrarily large .",
    "the other striking property is related to a nonmonotonic dependence of the order parameter on temperature . in the most extreme case ,",
    "for example , a nonzero gap can appear at finite temperature even it was exactly zero at @xmath192 .",
    "in a superconducting system , when one increases the temperature at a given chemical potential , thermal motion will eventually break up the quark cooper pairs . in the weakly interacting bardeen - copper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory , the transition between the superconducting and normal phases is usually of second order .",
    "the ratio of the critical temperature @xmath193 to the zero temperature value of the gap @xmath194 is a universal value @xcite @xmath195 where @xmath196 is the euler constant . in the conventional 2sc phase of quark matter with equal densities of the up and down quarks ,",
    "the ratio of the critical temperature to the zero temperature value of the gap is also the same as in the bcs theory @xcite . in the spin-0 color flavor",
    "locked phase as well as in the spin-1 color spin locked phase , on the other hand , this ratio is larger than bcs ratio by the factors @xmath197 and @xmath198 , respectively .",
    "these deviations are related directly to the presence of two different types of quasiparticles with nonequal gaps @xcite .",
    "this commonly accepted picture of the finite temperature effects in superconducting phases changes drastically in the case of dense quark matter when the @xmath0-equilibrium and the local neutrality conditions are enforced .",
    "below , we study this in detail .      here",
    "we consider the gap equation and charge neutrality conditions in the g2sc phase at finite temperature . because of additional technical complications appearing at finite temperature , most of the results that follow will be obtained by numerical computation .",
    "it is important to keep in mind , however , that our approach remains conceptually the same as that at zero temperature .    before studying the gap equation ( [ gap - t ] ) , we recall that the right hand side of this equation is a function of the three chemical potentials @xmath95 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "is adjusted to make the quark matter also electrically neutral .",
    "as in the case of zero temperature , the resulting color chemical potential @xmath54 is much smaller than the other two chemical potentials in neutral quark matter .",

    "the numerical calculations show , in fact , that even the approximation @xmath201 does not modify considerably the exact solutions to the gap equation and to the electrical charge neutrality condition . in practice ,",
    "we either tabulate the function @xmath199 for a given set of parameters , or determine it numerically in the vicinity of the ground state solution .",

    "the same applies to the disappearance of the double - branch structure of the solution at a finite value of the temperature , @xmath207 mev .",
    "indeed , in a model that treats the electrical chemical potential as a free parameter , this value of the temperature @xmath208 marks the expected switch of two regimes .",
    "namely , while the phase transition controlled by the @xmath53 parameter ( i.e. , neutrality is not required ) is a first order phase transition at @xmath209 , it becomes a second order phase transition at @xmath210 .",
    "we also observe that the value of the electrical chemical potential at the point where the solution to the gap equation intersects with the @xmath53-axis has a nonmonotonic dependence on the temperature .",
    "with increasing temperature , this value increases first and , after reaching some maximum value , starts to decrease and goes down to zero eventually . when the interplay with the neutrality condition is taken into account later",

    "[ gap-vs-mue-t.eps ] , we also show the neutrality lines ( dashed lines ) for the same values of temperature ( @xmath192 , @xmath202 , @xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 mev ) .",
    "the convention is that the lengths of the dashes decreases with increasing the value of the temperature . as we see , with increasing temperature , the neutrality line gets steeper while its intersection point with the @xmath53-axis moves towards larger values of @xmath53 .",
    "the points of intersection of these neutrality lines with the lines of solutions to the gap equation , when they exist , are shown as well .",
    "as in the case of zero temperature , see subsec .  [ gr - state ] and fig .",
    "[ v2d ] , we need to show that the points of intersections of the gap solutions with the corresponding neutrality lines in fig .  [ gap-vs-mue-t.eps ] represent the ground state of the neutral quark matter . to this end",
    ", we calculate the dependence of the thermodynamic potential on the value of the gap @xmath48 .",
    "since the charge neutrality condition is satisfied only along the neutrality line , we restrict the thermodynamic potential only to this line .",
    "the numerical results for several values of the temperature are shown in fig .",
    "[ potdd ] .",
    "the results at @xmath126 mev and @xmath133 show that , for any @xmath211 mev , the thermodynamic potential has the global minimum away from the origin , meaning that the corresponding ground state develops a nonzero expectation value of @xmath212 .",
    "needless to say that this is the same value that one extracts from the location of the geometrical construction in fig .",
    "[ gap-vs-mue-t.eps ] .",
    "the expectation value @xmath212 disappears gradually when the temperature approaches @xmath213 from below .",
    "this is an indication of the second order phase transition . at temperature higher than @xmath214 ,",
    "the ground state of neutral quark matter is the normal phase with @xmath215 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the gap is obtained by numerical solution of the gap equation ( [ gap - t ] ) together with the two charge neutrality conditions in eq .",
    "( [ q=0 ] ) . of course , this is equivalent to the geometrical construction used in fig .",
    "[ gap-vs-mue-t.eps ] , where the intersection points of two types of lines determine the values of the gaps in the ground state .",
    "the typical results for the default choice of parameters @xmath126 mev and @xmath133 are shown in fig .",
    "[ gap-mue0-vs-t.eps ] .",
    "both the values of the diquark gap ( solid line ) and the mismatch parameter @xmath216 ( dashed line ) are plotted .",
    "one very unusual property of the shown temperature dependence of the gap is the nonmonotonic behavior . only at sufficiently high temperatures ,",
    "the gap is a decreasing function .",
    "in the low temperature region , @xmath217 mev , however , it increases with temperature .",
    "for comparison , in the same figure , the diquark gap in the model with @xmath218 and @xmath201 is also shown ( dash - dotted line ) .",
    "this latter has the standard bcs shape .",
    "another interesting thing regarding the temperature dependences in fig .",
    "[ gap-mue0-vs-t.eps ] appears in the intermediate temperature region , @xmath219 mev . by comparing the values of @xmath212 and @xmath30 in this region",
    ", we see that the g2sc phase is replaced by a `` transitional '' 2sc phase there . indeed , the energy spectrum of the quasiparticles even at finite temperature is determined by the same relations in eqs .",
    "( [ disp - ub ] ) and ( [ 2-degenerate ] ) that we used at zero temperature . when @xmath220 , the modes determined by eq .",
    "( [ 2-degenerate ] ) are gaped .",
    "then , according to our standard classification , the ground state is the 2sc phase .",
    "it is fair to say , of course , that the qualitative difference of the g2sc and 2sc phases is not so striking at finite temperature as it is at zero temperature .",
    "this difference is particularly negligible in the region of interest where temperatures @xmath221 mev are considerably larger than the actual value of the smaller gap , @xmath222 . by increasing the value of the coupling constant slightly ,",
    "however , the transitional 2sc phase can be made much stronger and the window of intermediate temperatures can become considerably wider . in either case , we find it rather unusual that the g2sc phase of neutral quark matter is replaced by a transitional 2sc phase at intermediate temperatures which , at higher temperatures , is replaced by the g2sc phase again .",
    "it appears that the temperature dependence of the diquark gap is very sensitive to the choice of the diquark coupling strength @xmath223 in the model at hand .",
    "this is not surprising because the solution to the gap equation is very sensitive to this choice .",
    "the resulting interplay of the solution for @xmath48 with the condition of charge neutrality , however , is very interesting .",
    "this is demonstrated by the plot of the temperature dependence of the diquark gap calculated for several values of the diquark coupling in fig .",
    "[ gap - eta ] .",
    "the most amazing are the results for weak coupling .",
    "it appears that the gap function could have sizable values at finite temperature even if it is exactly zero at zero temperature .",
    "this possibility comes about only because of the strong influence of the neutrality condition on the ground state preference in quark matter . because of the thermal effects",
    ", the positive electrical charge of the diquark condensate is easier to accommodate at finite temperature .",
    "this opens a possibility of the cooper pairing that is forbidden at zero temperature .",
    "we should mention that somewhat similar results for the temperature dependence of the gap were also obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite in a study of the asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the asymmetry parameter in nuclear matter @xmath224 ( where @xmath225 and @xmath226 are the neutron and proton densities , respectively ) plays a role similar to the coupling strength @xmath28 in the quark matter system .      in the preceding subsection",
    ", we saw that the temperature dependence of the gap in the g2sc phase is very different from the standard benchmark result in the bcs theory .",
    "one of the main properties of the bcs temperature dependence is a universal value of the ratio of the critical temperature @xmath214 to the value of the gap at zero temperature @xmath228 , see eq .",
    "( [ r_bcs ] ) .",
    "it is instructive , therefore , to calculate the same quantity in the g2sc phase of neutral quark matter .",
    "let us start from a simple exercise , and consider the results plotted in fig .",
    "[ gap-mue0-vs-t.eps ] more carefully .",
    "first of all , we find that @xmath229 mev and @xmath230 mev when there is no mismatch parameters in the model ( i.e. , @xmath218 and @xmath201 represented by dash - dotted line ) .",
    "it is not very surprizing that the ratio of interest @xmath231 is in agreement with the bcs result .",
    "now , if we check the results for the gap function in the g2sc phase ( solid line ) , we find that @xmath232 mev and @xmath233 mev .",
    "thus , the ratio is @xmath234 which is considerably larger than the 2sc result .",
    "it appears that the real situation is even more interesting .",
    "the result for the ratio @xmath235 is not universal .",
    "in fact , its value depends very much on the diquark coupling constant and , moreover , it can even be arbitrarily large",
    ". this last statement may not be so unexpected if we recall the temperature dependences of the gap shown in fig .",
    "[ gap - eta ] .",
    "the numerical results for the ratio of the critical temperature to the zero temperature gap in the g2sc case as a function of the diquark coupling strength @xmath223 are plotted in fig",
    ".  [ ratio ] .",
    "the dependence is shown for the most interesting range of values of @xmath223 , @xmath236 , which allows the g2sc stable ground state at zero temperature , see the discussion in subsec .",
    "[ w - i - s ] .",
    "when the coupling gets weaker in this range , the zero temperature gap vanishes gradually . as we saw from fig .",
    "[ gap - eta ] , however , this does not mean that the critical temperature vanishes too .",
    "therefore , the ratio of a finite value of @xmath214 to the vanishing value of the gap can become arbitrarily large .",
    "in fact , it remains strictly infinite for a range of couplings .",
    "in this paper , we presented a detailed study of the zero and finite temperature properties of the gapless color superconducting phase of neutral two - flavor quark matter in @xmath0-equilibrium .",
    "the spectrum of quasiparticles in this phase has _",
    "four _ gapless and only two gaped fermionic modes , see eqs .",
    "( [ disp - ub])([2-degenerate ] ) with @xmath237 .",
    "this is in contrast to the conventional 2sc phase that has only _ two _ gapless and four gaped quasiparticles , see the case with @xmath238 .",
    "as we show , the choice of the ground state is predetermined by the strength of the diquark coupling . in strong coupling regime ,",
    "the 2sc survives even under the constrain of the charge neutrality and @xmath0-equilibrium .",
    "when the coupling is not very strong , the 2sc ground state is replaced by the g2sc phase . finally , at weak coupling , the stable ground state corresponds to the normal phase .    in the g2sc phase , like in the conventional 2sc phase , the original color symmetry su@xmath239 is broken down to su@xmath240 . despite that",
    ", the low energy spectrum of the gapless phase looks very similar to the spectrum in the normal quark matter . by the `` normal quark matter '' here",
    "we understand the mixture of the following four normal components : ( i ) red and green up quarks with an effective fermi momentum @xmath241 , ( ii ) red and green down quarks with an effective fermi momentum @xmath242 , ( iii ) blue up quarks with @xmath243 and ( iv ) blue down quarks with @xmath244 .",
    "needless to say that the similarity extends only in a small region of low energies , @xmath245 .",
    "this similarity suggests that there is no color meissner effect in this phase of matter , although the gauge symmetry is broken through the anderson - higgs mechanism .",
    "the same arguments regarding the resemblance of the low energy spectrum in the g2sc and normal phases of quark matter lead us to the conclusion that two `` secondary '' spin-1 condensates should develop on top of the gapless ground state .",
    "indeed , the existence of highly degenerate gapless modes around the effective two fermi surfaces should lead to the appearance of additional condensates , provided an attractive channel exists . because of the red - green color degeneracy of the quasiparticles around @xmath246 and @xmath242 , the attractive antisymmetric channel should exist . as a result , two spin-1 gaps would open around the points where the gapless modes used to be .",
    "most likely , the appearance of the spin-1 gaps is a small effect on top of the g2sc ground state .",
    "therefore , many thermodynamical properties of quark matter would not be affected by their presence .",
    "the transport properties , on the other hand , should be modified .",
    "in particular , five gluons of the original su@xmath239 gauge group should experience the color meissner effect .",
    "in addition there will also be the electromagnetic meissner effect @xcite .",
    "at finite temperature , the properties of the g2sc phase are very unusual .",
    "one of the most striking results is that the ratio of the critical temperature to the gap at zero temperature is not a universal number .",
    "it depends on the choice of the coupling constant in the diquark channel .",
    "moreover , the value of the ratio can become arbitrarily large with proper choice of the coupling . for a range of values",
    ", it is infinite .",
    "this is a simple consequence of the nonmonotonic temperature dependence of the diquark gap function on temperature . in an extreme case",
    ", the finite temperature gap can be nonzero even if the zero temperature gap is zero . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the only other example of such a temperature behavior of an order parameter was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite in a study of the asymmetric nuclear matter .    in nature",
    ", gapless 2sc quark matter could exist in compact stars .",
    "indeed , this phase is neutral with respect to electric and color charges and satisfies the @xmath0-equilibrium condition by construction .",
    "if this is indeed the case , one may have a chance to detect the indirect signatures of its presence by deciphering the observational data from stars .",
    "the study of the physical properties of the g2sc phase in this paper is the first step in this direction . in future",
    ", one should also study the transport properties of the g2sc phase .",
    "for example , the knowledge of the neutrino emissivities and mean free paths would be crucial for the understanding of the cooling rates of stars with such a gapless phase in their interior .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , some stable gapless phases may also be realized in the asymmetric nuclear matter @xcite and in two - component mixtures of cold fermionic atoms @xcite .",
    "the results of this paper might also be useful for a deeper understanding of the properties of such nonrelativistic systems .",
    "for example , the similarity of the spectrum of the low energy quasiparticles in the gapless phase and the normal matter seems to suggest that there is no superfluidity in the corresponding phases of cold atom mixtures .",
    "of course , one should be careful before making a conclusive statement because the corresponding nonrelativistic systems are quite different from neutral quark matter .",
