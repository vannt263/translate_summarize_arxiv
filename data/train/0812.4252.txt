    "open theoretical questions include , for instance , the finite temperature transport of the anisotropic spin-1/2 chain with nearest - neighbor interactions ( the @xmath0 chain ) , with an unsettled debate on whether finite temperature transport in the heisenberg chain is ballistic or not @xcite as well as on the actual temperature dependence of the drude weight.@xcite for nonintegrable models and finite temperatures , one expects diffusive transport on general grounds,@xcite and numerical studies have widely confirmed this picture in the high - temperature limit and massive phases of spin models.@xcite a similar scenario has emerged for thermal transport.@xcite yet , the issue of ( quasi)ballistic transport in gapless phases of , _",
    "e.g. _ , the frustrated chain,@xcite at low temperatures is still under scrutiny .",
    "moreover , the possibility of anomalous transport due to a diverging coefficient of the dc conductivity has been emphasized.@xcite    much less is known about the non - linear transport at large external driving forces , or more generally , nonequilibrium properties .",
    "a recent study using a quantum master - equation approach has addressed the spin transport in the antiferromagnetic phase of the @xmath0 chain.@xcite the time - evolution of magnetization profiles in analytically exactly solvable models has been the case of interest in refs .  .    besides the fundamental interest in understanding large - bias and out - of - equilibrium phenomena , research into transport properties of low - dimensional spin systems is strongly motivated by exciting experimental results on large thermal conductivities in spin ladder and chain materials ( see , e.g. , refs .   for a review ) .",
    "most evidently in spin ladder materials such as ( la , sr , ca)@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 , such large thermal conductivities have been attributed to magnetic excitations.@xcite in a more recent experiment on la@xmath4ca@xmath5cu@xmath2o@xmath3,@xcite heat dynamics has been probed by time - of - flight measurements . in this",

    "a pronounced difference is seen comparing a surface that contains ladders to one that is perpendicular to the ladder direction . in the former case , heat diffuses predominantly along the ladder direction , while little dynamics is seen in the latter case .",
    "these results support the notion of anisotropic heat transport in this material,@xcite due to the contribution of magnetic excitations .    besides thermal transport measurements , questions of diffusive versus ballistic transport have been experimentally probed in nuclear magnetic resonance@xcite ( see ref .   for related theoretical work ) as well as muon spin resonance experiments.@xcite in a more recent development ,",

    "hamiltonians.@xcite    as far as numerical approaches are concerned , on the technical side , full exact diagonalization ( ed ) studies are restricted to system sizes of about 24 sites in the case of a spin-1/2 chain , while in quantum monte carlo simulations , the calculation of frequency dependent properties of more than two - point correlation functions remains difficult ( see , _",

    "while the methods mentioned so far are designed for pure bulk systems , quantum - master approaches that account for dissipation by incorporating baths have been used as well in the study of transport in 1d spin systems.@xcite such methods are not constrained to the linear response either and circumvent the use of kubo formulae , as they measure gradients and current expectation values directly .    in this work",
    "we will introduce and exploit an alternative approach based on zero - temperature tdmrg calculations . instead of analyzing currents and their correlation functions directly ,",
    "we study the magnetization dynamics after preparing the system in inhomogeneous initial states . for instance",
    ", we subject the system to an external magnetic field of gaussian shape and , after releasing the confining field , follow the time evolution of the magnetization . computing the variance of the magnetization allows us to distinguish ballistic from diffusive regimes , depending on model parameters : we consider the dynamics to be ballistic if the variance grows quadratically in time , which is the behavior of noninteracting particles , while a diffusive behavior manifests itself in a linear increase of the magnetization s variance .",
    "our approach has the advantage that we can characterize diffusion by following the time - evolution of a local quantity , the magnetization , as compared to the technically more difficult evaluation of the kubo formula@xcite or the measurement of time - dependent currents.@xcite moreover , we can control the deviation of the initial state from the ground state , thus scanning the regime of systems substantially driven out of equilibrium .",
    "while we show that our results for the spin-1/2 chain with an exchange anisotropy in the regime of small perturbations over the ground - state are consistent with the picture established by analyzing drude weights at zero temperature , namely ballistic transport in the massless and diffusive transport in the massive regime,@xcite we , in particular , argue that this also applies to systems far from equilibrium .",
