    "an upcoming generation of survey telescopes , such as act , apex , and spt , will map the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) with an unprecedented sensitivity and with resolution of @xmath01 .on degree scales , the main features of the cmb are fluctuations generated at the last scattering surface ( z @xmath0 1100 ) .",
    "however , on smaller angular scales , secondary effects produced through the interaction between the cmb and the large - scale matter distribution of the universe dominate the microwave sky .",
    "consequently , high resolution experiments will open a new window into different physical processes that affect the cmb photons as they travel from the recombination epoch to the present .",
    "in particular , these experiments are expected to provide invaluable information about the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( tsz ) , the kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich ( ksz ) effects , and the weak gravitational lensing effects .",
    "the weak lensing effect appears to be a particularly promising probe of the growth of structure .",
    "its imprints on the cmb sky have the potential of providing us with important information about the matter distribution over most of the cosmological history .",
    "so , besides testing our paradigm of structure formation , the measurement of the lensing effect can be very useful for constraining parameters like neutrino mass @xcite and the dark energy equation - of - state @xcite .",
    "lensing measurements can also assist cmb polarization measurements in detecting primordial gravity waves @xcite.there has been significant study of the effects of cmb lensing on the temperature and polarization power spectrum .",
    "power spectrum analysis of these quantities can give us important information about the power spectrum of dark matter @xcite .",
    "in addition , several works have been devoted to the development of methods for extracting the projected matter field using the higher order correlations induced by lensing on the cmb temperature and polarization @xcite.efforts to measure gravitational lensing may be limited by contamination produced by the tsz and ksz effects , and also by extragalactic point sources . whereas these contaminants are thought to be unimportant for polarization maps @xcite",
    ", they will likely contaminate the temperature anisotropies at angular scales of @xmath3 arcminutes and below .",
    "the spectral dependence of the tsz effect and the extragalactic point sources in principle provides the key for their removal from cmb temperature maps .",
    "however , the ksz effect is spectrally indistinguishable from the lensed primary cmb anisotropies , so a different method is required for removing this effect from cmb maps.a first method for reducing the ksz contamination of the lensing signal has already been proposed by @xcite .",
    "it uses the spatial correlation between the tsz and ksz effects to mask the main sources of ksz anisotropies .",
    "alternatively , in this work we suggest that the different statistical properties of the kinetic sz and weak lensing effects , in particular the non - gaussian features that they produce on the cmb anisotropies , can provide another tool for their separation .",
    "we introduce a new real - space statistic , @xmath2 , that we show vanishes for weakly lensed primary cmb anisotropies .",
    "consequently , this statistic would give us a clean measurement of the ksz effect .",
    "this measurement is expected to be useful for quantifying and controlling the ksz contamination of lensing field estimators , in addition to provide a new insight into the history of reionization and structure formation of the universe.this work is organized as follows : in chapter [ lensing ] we begin by reviewing the lensing effect on the cmb temperature , and introduce the @xmath2 statistic , showing how it vanishes for weakly lensed primary anisotropies . in chapter [ ksz ]",
    "we review the ksz effect and illustrate , using the ostriker - vishniac ( ov ) effect , how @xmath4 can be used to determine the different physical parameters involved in our models for the ksz effect . in chapter [ conclusiones ]",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "weak lensing on the cmb temperature can be described as a mapping of the unlensed temperature anisotropies , @xmath5 , into the lensed ones , @xmath6 .",
    "( note that we use @xmath7 for describing temperature anisotropies ) .",
    "the relation between these two maps is @xmath8 where the unitary vector @xmath9 defines a direction on the sky and @xmath10 represents the lensing deflection angle due to the intervening mass distribution .      according to the standard inflationary scenario ,",
    "the primordial density perturbations on the last scattering surface can be regarded as a nearly gaussian random field .",
    "consequently , the primary ( unlensed ) temperature anisotropies of the cmb will also have a gaussian m - point probability distribution given by , @xmath11 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times d\\theta(\\hat{n}_1)\\dots d\\theta(\\hat{n}_m ) , \\label{eq : gaussian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is an arbitrary positive integer and @xmath13 , the covariance matrix , is such that @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , the statistical nature of the unlensed anisotropies is completely specified by the two - point correlation function . more precisely , according to the wick s theorem , any @xmath12-point correlation function for a gaussian field will be given by , @xmath15 where @xmath16 means that the sum must be performed over the @xmath17 ways to make pairs.therefore , the appearance of an additional term , usually called connected part , in the @xmath12-point function is a direct probe of non - gaussianities that could have been induced by secondary effects like lensing or the ksz effects . since both effects are expected to have a null three - point function , in this work we will explore the potential of the connected part of the four - point function for accomplishing the separation of these two effects.in general , weak lensing produces a non - zero connected part for the four - point function of cmb temperature . it can be seen by taylor expanding equation ( [ eq : relation ] ) , @xmath18 and calculating the first correction to the connected part of the four - point function due to lensing . doing so one obtains , @xmath19 where the index `` c '' means `` connected part '' , and @xmath20 is @xmath21 if @xmath22 , @xmath12 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 are all different from each other and @xmath25 in all other cases .      in this section ,",
    "we introduce a new statistic , @xmath2 , and show that it vanishes for the weakly lensed primary anisotropies .",
    "it is defined as @xmath27 notice that , since it is a real - space statistic , it is not affected by any type of masking , and is straightforward to compute from temperature maps.as an illustration , the cancellation of this statistic for the weak lensing case can be easily seen from equation ( [ eq : lentri ] ) . if we set @xmath28 and @xmath29 , we obtain , @xmath30 but the last factor of equation ( [ eq : caca ] ) is @xmath31 , provided that @xmath32 does not depend on @xmath9 . this way we show that , to the lowest order in @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "eventhough equation ( [ eq : lentri ] ) is a good approximation ( since most of the lensing effect on the cmb is produced by linear density fluctuations , in which case @xmath35 is much smaller than the angular size of primary cmb anisotropies @xcite ) , we provide below a more general demonstration.we know that the cmb anisotropies can be expanded into spherical harmonics , @xmath36 where @xmath37 represents @xmath38 .",
    "then , @xmath39 since we assume that the primary cmb anisotropies are a gaussian random field , the last term in equation ( [ eq : spherharmonic2 ] ) can be decomposed into the sum of three terms corresponding to the three ways to make pairs . thus , defining @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 correspond to kronecker deltas and the bar over @xmath43 represents the complex conjugate of @xmath43 , it is easy to show that , @xmath44 but , making use of the addition theorem for spherical harmonics , @xmath45 where @xmath46 corresponds to the legendre polynomial and @xmath47 is the angle between @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and also using that @xmath50 , we can see that the sum @xmath51 in equation ( [ eq : spherharmonic3 ] ) will be just a function of @xmath22 and will not depend on the random field @xmath10 , so @xmath52 can be separated into the product of two sums , @xmath53 but , using the definitions of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and the addition theorem for spherical harmonics , it is easy to see that , @xmath56 so equation ( [ eq : casidem ] ) can be written , @xmath57 this way we demonstrate that , @xmath58 it is important to keep in mind that the only approximation used in our calculations was to neglect any possible non - gaussianity of the primary cmb anisotropies .",
    "we made no assumptions about the lensing deflection angle , @xmath33 .",
    "because of its cancellation , this statistic has the potential of giving us a direct measurement of the ksz effect .",
    "the scattering of cmb photons by free electrons within galaxies and the intergalactic medium creates anisotropies on the cmb temperature . when these anisotropies are due to the thermal energy that the electrons transfer to the cmb photons , the effect is called thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( tsz ) effect .",
    "this effect modifies the thermal nature of the spectrum of the cmb , reducing the number of low - energy photons and increasing the number of high - energy photons . at nearly 218",
    "ghz the energy spectrum of the cmb remains almost unchanged , giving rise to the so called thermal sunyaev - zeldovich  null \" , which is very important for identifying this effect from other secondary cmb signals.on the other hand , if the free electrons have a bulk peculiar motion , additional temperature fluctuations are generated .",
    "this effect , known as the kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich ( ksz ) effect , can be understood considering that in the rest frame of electrons the cmb is seen as hotter in one direction and colder in the opposite direction ( doppler effect ) . however , after their scattering with the electrons , part of the cmb photons are reemited isotropically in the rest frame of electrons generating a dipolar anisotropy in the rest frame of the cmb .",
    "this temperature anisotropy , which does not depend on frequency , is given by ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath59 where @xmath60 represents the comoving distance along the path of cmb photons , which we will also use as a time coordinate , the subscript `` rc '' means `` at recombination '' , @xmath61 is the scale factor , @xmath62 corresponds to the bulk velocity of electrons ( note that throught this work bold letters will represent three - dimensional vectors , while two - dimensional vectors will be represented by symbols like @xmath63 ) , @xmath64 is the speed of light , @xmath65 is the electron density , @xmath66 is the cross section for thomson scattering , and @xmath67 is the optical depth to electron scattering at @xmath60 .",
    "notice that in equation ( [ eq : ksz ] ) , like throughout this paper , we have assumed a flat universe.since in this work we are interested in fluctuations at arcminutes scales , we can describe the ksz effect by using the flat - sky approximation .",
    "then , we will use @xmath68 instead of @xmath9 to refer to the angular position on the sky , where @xmath9 will be assumed very close to the the @xmath69 axis ( i.e. , @xmath70 where @xmath71).the ksz effect is usually divided into two effects : the ostriker - vishniac ( ov ) effect and the non - linear ksz effect . the ov effect is due to the presence of reionized matter within linearly evolving density fluctuations , while the non - linear ksz effect is produced by electrons within non - linear structures .",
    "given the highly predictive power of linear theory , the ov effect can give us accurate information about reionization , mainly in its initial phase .",
    "however , since in the low - redshift universe most of the reionized matter resides in high density objects , a good understanding of both regimes is essential in order to have a complete picture of the ksz effect .      in this work",
    ", we will focus only on the linear version of the ksz effect , the ov effect .",
    "we will assume that the spatial distribution of free electrons is the same as the spatial distribution of dark matter , i. e. , we will assume a homogeneously reionized universe and that dark matter traces baryons .",
    "therefore , we will be interested in @xmath72 where @xmath73 represents the dark matter density.in the linear regime , the time evolution of the dark matter density perturbations is given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 , @xmath76 is the growth function , and @xmath77.it is useful to define the power spectrum @xmath78 of the density perturbations as @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 correspond to the fourier transform of @xmath82 and the dirac delta , respectively.in linear theory , the velocity field can be obtained from the continuity equation .",
    "its fourier transform is @xmath83 where @xmath84 denotes the derivative of @xmath85 with respect to _ time_.from equation ( [ eq : continuity ] ) we see that only fourier modes with a non - zero line of sight component ( i.e. , @xmath86 in the flat - sky approximation ) contribute to @xmath87 .",
    "however , for a slow enough reionization process , the successive troughs and crests of these modes tend to cancel when projected along the @xmath69 axis .",
    "because of this , as we will see below , the ov effect arises from the modulation of the velocity field by the spatial fluctuations in the electron density .",
    "these fluctuations may be due to inhomogeneities in the baryon density and/or in the ionization fraction .",
    "although the latter case , known as the patchy reionization effect , can give rise to important temperature anisotropies @xcite , we will concentrate in a homogeneously reionized universe where the ov effect is due only to fluctuations in the baryon density.then , in the flat - sky approximation , the temperature fluctuations can be written as @xmath88 where @xmath89 is called the visibility function , and @xmath90.the fourier transform of @xmath91 is @xmath92 from equation ( [ eq : fourier_q ] ) , we can see that @xmath93 .",
    "this is very important because , given that the modes perpendicular to @xmath69 do not cancel out when projected along the line of sight , in a slowly varying reionization process they dominate the ov effect.finally , it can be shown that the fourier transform of @xmath94 is @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the components perpendicular and parallel to the @xmath69 axis of @xmath98 .",
    "for the calculation of the @xmath99 statistic for the ostriker - vishniac effect , @xmath100 , we must compute the trispectrum @xmath101 , which is defined by @xmath102 where @xmath103 is given by equation ( [ eq : teta_l ] ) . in order to do so",
    ", we will use the limber s approximation @xcite .",
    "it consists in considering @xmath104 as the sum of the contributions @xmath105 from many shells centered at @xmath106 and of width @xmath107 which is much larger than the relevant wavelengths .",
    "these conditions can be expressed as @xmath108 and @xmath109 where @xmath110 represents the angular scale of interest .",
    "then , according to equation ( [ eq : teta_l ] ) , the fourier transform of @xmath105 is @xmath111 if @xmath112 and @xmath113 vary slowly with the comoving distance @xmath60 , they can be considered constant within each shell .",
    "then , one can obtain that @xmath114 where @xmath115.in the limber s approximation , the fields defined within different shells are , by assumption , statistically independent .",
    "therefore , the trispectrum of the ov effect is the sum of the independent trispectra generated in all the shells.for the calculation of these trispectra , we need to compute @xmath116 . in order to do so , we use the fact that , in the linear regime , @xmath117 can be considered as a gaussian random field , and use the wick s theorem .",
    "the presence of @xmath118 in equation ( [ eq : delta_teta_l ] ) implies that the contribution to the effect comes mainly from @xmath119 .",
    "in addition , the condition @xmath109 means that @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , as stated above , the main contribution to the ov effect comes from fourier modes of @xmath121 nearly perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "then , we can approximate @xmath122 and perform the integration over @xmath97 in equation ( [ eq : delta_teta_l ] ) in a very easy way.finally , approximating the sum of the trispectra from all the shells to an integral , one can obtain that @xmath123 where @xmath124 @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 . notice that equation ( [ eq : tov ] ) differs from equation ( 60 ) of @xcite by the combinatorial factor @xmath129.now , if we define @xmath130 we have @xmath131 so , considering equation ( [ eq : tov ] ) , we obtain @xmath132 where @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 .",
    "the amplitude and shape of @xmath137 depends on the reionization history of the universe ( contained in the visibility function @xmath112 ) .",
    "there is not yet certainty about the actual shape of @xmath112 ; in fact , the aim of this work is to contribute to answering this question .",
    "however , in order to show the kind of information that can be obtained from the @xmath2 statistic , in this section we calculate @xmath137 making use of a very simple model for @xmath112.in order to do so , we use the flat-@xmath138 cosmological model with the cosmological parameters given by ( @xmath139 ) = ( 0.24 , 0.04 , 0.73 , 0.95 , 0.09 , 0.74 ) , in agreement with the three years wmap results @xcite . for the transfer function",
    "we make use of the fitting form given by @xcite .",
    "we assume a mass fraction of hydrogen and helium of @xmath140 and @xmath141 , respectively , with simultaneous hydrogen and helium reionizations .     for four two - stage reionization scenarios .",
    "the solid , long - dashed , dashed , and dotted lines , represent reionization histories with @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and @xmath145 , respectively . in the four cases we have assumed @xmath146 and @xmath147.,width=604 ]    for the reionization history , we assume a very simple two - stage model",
    ". in this model the universe is partially reionized at redshift @xmath148 , with an ionization fraction of @xmath149 .",
    "after that , at @xmath150 , the universe is completely ionized , i.e. , @xmath151 in figure ( [ fg : figura ] ) , we show the calculation of @xmath137 for four different reionization scenarios .",
    "the solid , long - dashed , dashed , and dotted lines , represent reionization histories with @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and @xmath145 , respectively .",
    "notice that all these scenarios have the same optical depth to thompson scattering at the last scattering surface , @xmath146 and the same @xmath147.we can see that , at angular scales relevant for the upcoming high resolution cmb experiments ( @xmath152 ) , @xmath137 varies by approximately a factor of @xmath153 between the comparatively early ( @xmath154 ) and late ( @xmath155 ) reionization scenarios .",
    "this result suggests that , eventhough @xmath2 also depends on other cosmological parameters like @xmath156 and @xmath157 , it would be sensitive enough to provide us with new information about the history of reionization of the universe when complemented with other independent measurements .",
    "however , before arriving to any conclusion about the relationship between @xmath137 and the physical parameters involved in reionization , our calculation must include more realistic models for the reionization process , and also consider the non - linear behaviour of the ksz effect .",
    "we propose non - gaussianity to separate the ksz effect from the lensing effect in cmb maps .",
    "specifically , we show that a particular shape of the trispectrum , @xmath4 , cancels for weakly lensed primary cmb anisotropies providing a very good tool for measuring the ksz effect.measurements of the amplitude of the ksz signal complement measurements of the optical depth and provide new insights into the reionization history of the universe .",
    "we show that reionization histories that produce similar low @xmath22 @xmath158 signal have very different ksz signatures .",
    "in addition to yield a new insight into the history of reionization and structure formation of the universe , @xmath4 could become very useful for quantifying and controlling the ksz contamination of lensing statistics.while our calculation is based on a linear theory estimate and needs further investigation with full numerical simulations of reionization , we suspect that they will confirm our basic conclusion that ksz measurements will shed more light on the dark ages .",
