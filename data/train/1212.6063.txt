    "the idea of analog quantum simulations , that is , engineering one quantum system to replicate the behaviour of another that one wishes to study , was first proposed by feynman @xcite with regards to the infeasibility of simulating quantum systems on classical computers .",
    "the simulating system typically involves a larger number of degrees of freedom , and the effective simulation relies on precise variation of system parameters through exquisite experimental control .",
    "this idea has become reality in recent years @xcite and fundamental models of interacting quantum systems have been realized thanks , for example , to advances in the control and manipulation of ultracold gases in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "systems based on cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cavity qed ) also offer exciting possibilities , as exemplified by the recent demonstration of the dicke quantum phase transition with a superfluid atomic gas in an optical cavity @xcite , in which a pair of discrete momentum states of the gas was used to simulate the two - level atoms of the original dicke model of superradiance @xcite .    in this work",
    "we focus on a closely related model  the rabi model  which describes the interaction of a two - state system ( atom or qubit ) with a single quantized harmonic oscillator ( electromagnetic field mode ) through the hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the qubit and oscillator frequencies , respectively , @xmath3 is the interaction strength , @xmath4 are two - state operators , and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator for the oscillator .",
    "this hamiltonian predicts accurately many physical situations where an atom  artificial or real  is interacting with a confined cavity field .",
    "however , when this model is used in the description of conventional cavity qed systems , it is generally the case that the coupling constant @xmath3 is much ( i.e. , orders of magnitude ) smaller than the frequencies @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this means that terms in @xmath7 that do not conserve the total excitation number can be neglected , in what is known as the `` rotating wave approximation . ''",
    "this leads to probably the most studied model in quantum optics , the jaynes - cummings model @xcite : @xmath8 recently , however , going beyond this approximation has gained newfound interest , as novel experimental systems have pushed the boundaries for the strength of the coupling between ( artificial ) atoms and cavity field modes . in particular , in experiments using circuit qed @xcite and semiconductor microcavities ,",
    "couplings between artificial atoms and cavity modes have reached the so - called `` ultrastrong '' regime @xcite . here ,",
    "values of @xmath9 have been realized , so that @xmath3 is no longer small compared to the mode frequency .",
    "these experimental advances have in turn stimulated new theoretical investigations ( see , for example , @xcite ) , as the conventional treatment is no longer adequate . to appreciate this necessity , notice that for the jaynes - cummings model , @xmath10 conserves the total excitation number ( i.e. , @xmath11 ) , and , together with conservation of energy , this means that the spectrum is easily found .",
    "if , on the other hand , the terms @xmath12 and @xmath13 can not be ignored , then this is no longer the case , and until recently no analytical solution was known .",
    "this was remedied in @xcite by braak , who showed that a discrete symmetry , the conservation of parity @xmath14 , is enough for the model to be integrable and derived analytical expressions for the spectrum ( see also @xcite ) . even though some intuition can be drawn from the conservation of parity @xcite ,",
    "the conventional picture of excitation exchange between the atom and the field is clearly not valid , and the spectrum of the rabi model and the associated dynamics has been shown to exhibit a variety of novel and significant nonclassical effects , such as initial state revivals @xcite , strong atom - field entanglement @xcite , and generation of photons from the vacuum through modulation of the coupling constant @xcite or qubit frequency @xcite .",
    "based on the above discussion , it follows that practical realizations of the rabi model in the various regimes of coupling strength will be important to completing our understanding of the coupling of light to matter at the most fundamental level .",
    "we suggest that quantum simulation can be a valuable tool in this respect .",
    "indeed , an analog simulation of the rabi model based on light transport in waveguides was realized in @xcite , and a way of simulating the model based on circuit qed was recently proposed in @xcite .",
    "such effective realizations are important not only because they have the potential to simulate even greater coupling strengths than can be achieved at present by `` direct '' coupling between two - level systems and cavity modes , but also because they offer flexible means of controlling other model parameters , as well as convenient ways of probing the dynamics through well - defined output channels and measurements .    in this vein , we wish to propose a realization of the rabi model with a single real atom coupled to a high finesse optical cavity mode .",
    "two stable hyperfine ground states of the multilevel atom make up the effective two - level system , while ( resonant ) raman transitions between them are induced by the cavity field and auxiliary laser fields .",
    "this allows us to simulate the rabi model with essentially arbitrary tuning of the effective frequencies and coupling constant , so that any regime , including ultrastrong and deep - strong coupling , can be accessed and explored .",
    "although the model could in principle be realized with a variety of ( alkali ) atoms , we focus on the d1 line of @xmath15rb , and consider cavity qed parameters that should be achievable with , for example , microtoroidal whispering - gallery - mode ( wgm ) resonators @xcite .    inevitably , all such systems are subject to dissipation , and the hamiltonian model must be expanded to an open systems treatment .",
    "we will see that our effective model is described by a master equation of the form @xmath16 + \\kappa ( 2a\\rho a\\dagg - a\\dagg a \\rho - \\rho a\\dagg a),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the cavity decay rate .",
    "on the one hand , we can realistically expect @xmath17 to be small enough for the hamiltonian dynamics to dominate on appreciable time scales , so that the rabi model dynamics is prominent . on the other hand ,",
    "the dissipative cavity qed setup provides us with a convenient means of observing the dynamics via the output field of the cavity .",
    "furthermore , the open systems dynamics is of interest in itself , and the steady state of is known to possess some very interesting features @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , however , that such a master equation is incorrect for circuit qed systems genuinely in the ultrastrong coupling regime @xcite , as it predicts unphysical results such as photon generation from the vacuum . in our case",
    "however , such a photon flux is perfectly legitimate , given the energy input from the laser fields that help to drive the raman transitions that we use to implement our simulation of the rabi model .",
    "our scheme thus offers the possibility of realizing an open systems version of the rabi model that is subject to a simple ( `` conventional '' ) interaction with the environment ( i.e. , cavity damping ) and can hence explore certain novel features of the rabi model beyond what might be achievable with genuine systems .",
    "in addition , our scheme offers a generalization of the rabi model by the addition of an extra term in the effective hamiltonian describing a non - linear coupling between the qubit and the oscillator .",
    "this term takes the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a tunable parameter , and can be viewed as a dynamical shift of the oscillator frequency , @xmath20 .",
    "a coupling of this nature typically arises as an approximation to the jaynes - cummings model in the dispersive limit ( i.e. , when @xmath21 ) , whereas for our model it can be present independent of the relative sizes of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and of a magnitude that may in fact be comparable to or even larger than these parameters . although our initial focus will be on the effective realization of the rabi model , , such that we set @xmath19 to zero or to a small enough value the effect of the non - linear coupling is unimportant , we will see that variation of this parameter is extremely interesting in itself and can lead to dramatic changes in the system s properties . in particular , we find two `` critical '' values of @xmath19 ( @xmath22 ) , about which , in the deep strong coupling regime ( @xmath23 ) , sharp transitions occur in the quantum state of the system , marked by clear signatures in the cavity field .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on the connection between the model proposed here , and models simulating the collective interaction of an ensemble of two - level atoms with a single field mode .",
    "our scheme is essentially the single atom version of the proposed realization of the dicke model presented in @xcite . by showing that an effective ultrastrong coupling regime is in principle achievable on the single atom level using a @xmath15rb coupled to a high finesse optical microcavity",
    ", we also offer a specific means of realizing the many - atom dicke model quantum phase transition as proposed in @xcite ( which requires only strong collective coupling of @xmath24 atoms to a cavity mode , a much weaker requirement than the very strong single atom coupling assumed in this work ) .",
    "we also note the related work that has been done in @xcite .",
    "in fact , the above - mentioned experimental realization of the dicke quantum phase transition @xcite was carried out using a scheme analogous to that of @xcite , but based upon laser - plus - cavity - mediated , resonant raman transitions between discrete momentum states of a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "notably , that particular scheme also gives rise to a nonlinear coupling term of the form @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the many - atom inversion operator .",
    "the dicke model including this term has been studied theoretically in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath27 ) in @xcite , where phase diagrams for the semiclassical steady state have been mapped out for parameters related primarily to the experiment of @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear atom - photon coupling was shown to be of fundamental importance ; in particular , a new superradiant phase is possible if the effective nonlinear coupling constant is negative ( @xmath28 ) . our scheme could also offer a flexible platform for exploring such a regime and , indeed , the sharp transitions we already see at the single atom level highlight this possibility .",
    "the physical configuration that we consider here employs electric dipole transitions on the d1 line of a single @xmath15rb atom . by coupling the atom simultaneously to an optical cavity mode and two laser fields , two stable hyperfine ground states ",
    "one in the @xmath29 level and one in the @xmath30 level of the @xmath31 state  are connected through a pair of ( distinct ) raman transitions .",
    "the specific scheme is illustrated in .",
    "in particular , @xmath32- and @xmath33-polarized laser fields , separated in frequency by approximately twice the ground - state hyperfine splitting of @xmath34  ghz and each far from resonance with the @xmath35 transition frequency , combine with a @xmath36-polarized cavity mode to drive resonant or near - resonant raman transitions between pairs of states , each of which consist of one state in the @xmath29 level and one in the @xmath30 level .",
    "we will eventually focus on just one pair of states , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , but for the moment consider the most general model .",
    "we introduce atomic dipole transition operators @xmath39 connecting level @xmath40 in the @xmath31 state to level @xmath41 in the @xmath42 state with polarization @xmath43 : @xmath44 here , @xmath45 labels the magnetic sublevel , @xmath46 denotes @xmath47-polarization , respectively , and @xmath48 is the corresponding dipole operator .",
    "the dipole matrix elements are normalized such that @xmath49 , and numerical values for the elements can be found , for example , in @xcite .",
    "we can then compactly write the full hamiltonian of the system in the form ( setting @xmath50 )    @xmath51    here , @xmath52 is the cavity frequency , @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) is the frequency ( energy ) of the atomic @xmath55 level relative to the @xmath56 level , with primed quantities denoting the excited levels , and @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the laser frequencies . for brevity",
    ", we use the notation @xmath59 , @xmath60 , while @xmath5 ( @xmath61 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator for the cavity mode .",
    "the laser rabi frequencies are @xmath62 and @xmath63 , while @xmath64 is the atom - cavity coupling strength .",
    "note that the terms in @xmath65 that are proportional to @xmath66 ( and their conjugates ) do not participate in any resonant or near - resonant raman transitions and are not shown in , but these `` off - resonant '' terms can induce non - negligible shifts of the effective two - level frequency splitting that we derive below .",

    "the spontaneous emission rate for the d1 line of @xmath15rb is @xmath72  mhz .",
    "we are most interested in parameter regimes where the atomic excited state populations are negligible , so we will neglect atomic spontaneous emission in the effective model that we derive below .",
    "however , spontaneous emission will be included in all of our numerical simulations of the full model above and we consider its effects in .",
    "as alluded to above , we assume very large detunings of the fields from the atomic excited states , so that these states are only ever virtually populated ( assuming no initial population ) and can be adiabatically eliminated to yield an effective model involving only ground states ( i.e. , levels in the state @xmath31 ) . to do this",
    "it is first convenient to move to a rotating frame through the unitary transformation defined by @xmath73 with @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a frequency close ( or equal ) to @xmath76 , the ground state hyperfine splitting .",
    "we will from now on assume this transformation when referring to .",
    "defining @xmath77 the condition for the validity of the adiabatic elimination is that @xmath78 . neglecting spontaneous emission and terms rotating ( in the transformed frame ) at frequency @xmath79",
    ", we obtain an effective hamiltonian describing energy shifts of the ground state levels due to the various fields , and ( raman ) couplings between pairs of levels , each pair consisting of one level in the @xmath29 state and one in the @xmath30 state .",
    "focusing on the two leftmost levels as depicted in ( b ) , the relevant part of the effective hamiltonian can be written @xmath80 here we have identified @xmath81 , @xmath82 , introduced pauli operators @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and dropped constant energy terms .",
    "the parameters of the effective hamiltonian are given by @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87  mhz is the excited state hyperfine splitting .",
    "note that , in fact , @xmath88 .",
    "the numerical prefactors to the various terms are products of dipole matrix elements associated with the atomic transitions @xcite",
    ".      we can choose @xmath89 ( real ) , so that @xmath90 reduces to the form of a generalised rabi model , @xmath91 the term proportional to @xmath19 can be made small compared to the other terms ( or even zero ) with a judicious choice of the physical parameters .",
    "provided this is so , @xmath92 achieves an essentially faithful realization of the rabi model .",
    "furthermore , the effective frequencies and coupling strength of the model are all determined by either level shifts or raman transition rates , which are tunable via the laser frequencies and intensities and can therefore be chosen to be of the same magnitude .",
    "in other words , we have a model of a two level system coupled to a single mode of the electromagnetic field where it is in principle possible to access any regime of coupling strength  strong , ultrastrong or deep - strong coupling  as defined by the ratios @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",

    "very small mode volumes offer the prospect of electric dipole coupling strengths reaching values in the hundreds of mhz , while ultrahigh quality factors exceeding @xmath98 correspond to sub - mhz field mode decay rates at alkali atom transition frequencies @xcite .",
    "below , we choose the value @xmath99  mhz for most of our numerical simulations of the full model , and consider field decay rates in the range @xmath100  mhz .      to demonstrate how the effective parameters , eqs .",

    "the degeneracy of the ground state and one or more excited states at a critical point is a signature of an equilibrium quantum phase transition in many - body systems , where one either has a level - crossing , or an `` avoided '' level - crossing that only becomes an exact degeneracy in the thermodynamic limit of an infinite number of particles @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the degeneracy of an infinite number of states at the `` critical points '' @xmath22 that we consider here exists even for a single atom . of course , the system we are considering is intrinsically open , and considering an equilibrium version is not necessarily meaningful , as this is fundamentally different from the @xmath214 limit of the dissipative model .",

    "this model can be derived by finding equations of motion for @xmath218 , @xmath197 and @xmath219 from . by assuming factorisation of operator products , @xmath220 for @xmath221 and @xmath222 , the equations form a closed set : @xmath223 where @xmath224 , @xmath225 and @xmath226 .",

    "it has been studied theoretically in great detail in @xcite where semiclassical phase - diagrams where mapped out , with distinct superradiant phases , co - existence regions and regimes with persistent oscillations . in particular , the values @xmath227 and @xmath205 mark the change in stability of the semiclassical normal ( @xmath228 , @xmath229 ) and inverted ( @xmath230 , @xmath229 ) steady states , respectively .",
    "in fact , many of the features observed in the state of the cavity field ( in terms of the wigner function ) in can be interpreted as manifestations on the single atom level of what become superradiant phase transitions in the thermodynamic limit : for the choice of parameters in , the semiclassical analysis predicts a superradiant phase for @xmath231 ( denoted srb in @xcite ) which on the single atom level manifests itself as a weak splitting of the wigner - function , as seen for @xmath232 in .",
    "simulations reveal that this splitting becomes more pronounced as the number of atoms in the cavity is increased , which points to a macroscopic photon number in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "then an extremely narrow co - existence region is predicted for @xmath233 , which we relate to the four - peaked wigner - function for @xmath234 . in the region",
    "@xmath235 another distinct superradiant phase comes into existence ( denoted sra in @xcite ) , which in our case manifests itself as a more strongly split wigner function . finally , the region @xmath236 is a region of semiclassical persistent oscillations of @xmath173 and @xmath237 and a value for @xmath238 that tends to zero as @xmath19 grows .",
