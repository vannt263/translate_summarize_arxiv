    "mathematical models are used throughout infectious disease epidemiology to understand the dynamical processes that shape patterns of disease  @xcite . while early models did not include complex population structure , modeling approaches now frequently let the epidemic spread take place on a network , which enables greater realism than a model in which all individuals mix homogeneously .",
    "it does , however , pose many technical problems for model analysis , particularly the question of how heterogeneity in the number of links each individual participates in  their degree  influences the epidemic  @xcite .    similarly , even though some of the earliest mathematical models of infectious diseases were stochastic , accounting for the chance nature of transmission of infection  @xcite , much of the applied modeling that followed was deterministic and based on non - linear differential equations  @xcite .",
    "more recent applied work has , however , recognized the importance of using stochastic epidemic models  @xcite and also of the development of associated methodology  @xcite .",
    "the difficulty in mathematically analyzing models which include both stochastic elements and network structure can be a reason for not including these factors , but we prefer to include them , and subsequently to systematically reduce the complexity of the resulting model .",
    "this is the approach we adopt in this paper ; the reduction process being made possible because of the existence of a separation of time - scales : many variables `` decaying '' away rapidly , leaving a few slow variables which govern the medium- to long - term dynamics .    compartmental models of epidemics typically assume that the majority of the population starts susceptible to infection , with a small number infectious , who then spread infection to others before recovering .",
    "a key distinction is between susceptible - infectious - susceptible ( sis ) dynamics in which recovery returns an individual to the susceptible compartment and susceptible - infectious - recovered ( sir ) dynamics in which recovery removes an individual from a further role in the next epidemic  @xcite , with the former being used to model e.g.  sexually transmitted infections other than hiv and the latter e.g.pandemic influenza  @xcite .    in the theoretical analysis of epidemic models , a crucial quantity corresponds to the basic reproductive ratio @xmath0verbally described as the expected number of secondary cases infected per primary case early in the epidemic  @xcite . depending on the value of @xmath0 , either @xmath1 individuals will experience infection in a population of size @xmath2the model is then said to be supercritical  or @xmath3 individuals will experience infection in a population of size @xmath2the model is then subcritical  thus defining an epidemic threshold .    in reality , the contact network on which the disease spreads will often change over the course of the epidemic ; while approaches exist in which the dynamics of both the disease and the network are considered  @xcite , it is more common to consider two limiting cases .",
    "the first of these is a _",
    "static _ approach ( also called ` quenched ' ) in which the network is assumed to evolve much more slowly than the disease and which is typically approached analytically through the use of pair approximation and related techniques  @xcite .",
    "the second is a _ dynamic _ limit ( also called ` annealed ' or ` discrete heterogeneous ' ) in which the network is assumed to evolve much more quickly than the epidemic , and can be described by an effective network characterized by its degree distribution , in which all individuals sharing the same degree are considered equivalent .",
    "this case can be analyzed through use of a set of degree - indexed differential equations ( often called the ` heterogeneous mean field ' approach ) provided the maximum degree is not too large  @xcite .    when the distribution of degrees in the population is highly variable  a situation that appears to be supported empirically  @xcite  it was recognized that the epidemic may not exhibit straightforward critical behavior .",
    "this happens because as the population size @xmath2 becomes large , extremely small levels of infectiousness can lead to large epidemic sizes  @xcite or more accurately speaking the critical level of infectiousness can depend very sensitively on the largest degree , @xmath4 , in the network  @xcite . the behavior of highly heterogeneous network epidemics near criticality continues to generate interest in both the physics and mathematics literature  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the stochastic behavior of heterogeneous network epidemics over time .",
    "we study a network in the dynamic limit , characterized by a power - law degree distribution such that the probability of an individual having degree @xmath5 is given by @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , although the method of analysis is applicable to other distributions .",
    "this type of network has the property that the basic reproductive ratio , which is found to be proportional to the second moment of the degree distribution @xmath8 , diverges in the limit of infinite populations , leading to the absence of an epidemic threshold .",
    "this is evidently not the case when the population  and thus the degree cutoff  is finite , but the second moment of the distribution can still be extremely large for sufficiently large @xmath2 , and heterogeneity can play an important role in the dynamics of the system .    for the case of large but finite population size , we derive a two - dimensional stochastic differential equation ( sde ) approximation to full sir dynamics , which reduces to an analytically solvable one - dimensional system early in the epidemic .",
    "we perform simulations using a power - law degree distribution with a maximum degree cutoff @xmath4 , which show that our approach provides a good approximation provided @xmath4 is not too close to the population size .",
    "there have , to our knowledge , been no directly comparable studies of this kind . perhaps those closest have been , first the study of finite - size scaling of the sis model near the critical point to produce a phenomenological one - dimensional sde  @xcite , second , the derivation of a one - dimensional sde for the sis model from first principles , but using an adiabatic approximation that would only be expected to hold near the critical point  @xcite , and finally the study of a four - dimensional sde for the sir model on a static network that is much more complex than ours and less amenable to analysis  @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : formulation ] we introduce the model , and formulate it first at the level of individuals ( the microscale ) and then at the level of populations , but retaining a stochastic element ( the mesoscale ) .",

    "there are two appendices where technical details relevant to secs .",
    "[ sec : det ] and [ sec : fastvarelim ] have been relegated .",
    "in this section we formulate the model first at the microscale , that is , in terms of individuals , and from this derive a mesoscopic version of the model where the variables are continuous , and represent the fractions of types of individuals who are infected or who are susceptible to infection .",
    "the general procedure to do this is reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and has been previously applied to models of epidemics on networks  @xcite , albeit in situations where the nodes of the network contained many individuals , rather than just one , as in the present context .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , individuals are located at the nodes of a network through which they are exposed to infection from individuals at neighboring nodes .",
    "since we work in the dynamic limit , individuals do not alter their number of contacts when acquiring the infection or recovering from it , and the network plays no role other than encoding the information about how many connections to other individuals a given individual possesses .",
    "an individual is labeled according to whether it is ( i ) susceptible , infected or recovered , and ( ii ) the degree of the node where it is located .",
    "thus the variables at the microscale are @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "we will assume that the population is closed , i.e. , that @xmath13 , with total population @xmath14 , at all times , so that we can remove one of the variables : @xmath15 .",
    "two types of events can occur : the infection of a susceptible individual , whenever an individual of type @xmath16 comes in contact with one of type @xmath17contacts between individuals @xmath18 and @xmath19 having degrees @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , are governed by a poisson process with rate @xmath22 ; and the recovery of an infectious individual with rate @xmath23 . in this paper we will be interested in the properties of an epidemic that takes place over a much shorter timeframe than demographic processes and hence will ignore the birth and death of individuals , leaving the only interactions between the individuals to be :    1 .",
    "infection of an individual at a node of degree @xmath5 .",
    "the transition rate for this process is given by @xmath24 where the summation is over infected individuals labeled according to the degree of the node on which they are located .",
    "the only arguments of @xmath25 which are shown explicitly are those involving individuals on nodes of degree @xmath5 , since only these change in this process ; those on the right represent the initial state , and those on the left represent the final state .",

    "we will refer to the discrete model defined by eqs .",
    " as the full microscopic model , since we we shortly derive a mesoscopic model from it , and subsequently further reduce this model .",
    "once an initial state has been specified , the model is completely determined , and in principle @xmath34 can be found for any state @xmath27 at any time @xmath28 .",
    "this behavior can be explored numerically _ via _ monte carlo simulations ( e.g.  using gillespie s method  @xcite or other approaches  @xcite ) however our main interest in this paper is in approximating the master equation to obtain models which are more amenable to analysis .    a mesoscopic description of the process involves going over to new variables @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath12 , which are assumed continuous for large @xmath2 , but retaining the stochastic nature of the system by keeping @xmath2 large , but finite .",
    "a macroscopic description , on the other hand , would involve taking the limit @xmath37 , which renders the process deterministic , and which eliminates all effects of the original discrete nature of the system .",
    "the construction of the mesoscopic model involves expanding the master equation , eq .",
    ", in powers of @xmath38 and truncating this expansion at order @xmath39 .",

    "the final stage of the construction of the mesoscopic form of the model is to adopt a coarser time scale by introducing a new time variable @xmath52 . from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : fpe ] ) it can be see that without this change of variable , the macroscopic ( @xmath37 ) limit eliminates the right - hand side of the equation , giving a trivial macroscopic limit . with the change of variable , the first term on the right - hand side survives ( but without the factor @xmath53 ) , giving a liouville - like equation for @xmath31 , which implies a non - trivial deterministic dynamics .",
    "a clearer way to see this , and in fact a more intuitive formulation of the mesoscopic dynamics to that of the fokker - planck equation , is to use the sde which is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : fpe ] ) .",
    "we utilize the general result that a fokker - planck equation of the form given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : fpe ] ) is equivalent to the sde @xmath54 , where the @xmath55 are gaussian random variables with zero mean and a correlation matrix given by the matrix @xmath56 . in terms of the variables",
    "@xmath50 and @xmath51 , the sdes take the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 here the noise is to be interpreted in the sense of it  @xcite .",
    "it is clear from eqs .",

    "( 2.6 ) from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is convenient to make the noise in the sdes explicitly multiplicative .",

    ", we will be interested in networks where individuals can pick degrees from a truncated zipf distribution of the form @xmath67 and we let @xmath68",
    ". since we are interested in the case when @xmath4 is large , the number of equations making up the full mesoscopic model are so large that it can make any direct treatment impractical .",
    "therefore , in the following sections we will be concerned with reducing the number of equations , and we start by looking at the deterministic limit of the system .",
    "this will also have a crucial role to play in the reduction of the stochastic model , described in sec .",
    "[ sec : fastvarelim ] .",
    "the deterministic limit which controls the dynamics of the macroscopic version of the model is found by taking the @xmath37 limit of eqs .",
    " , and so eliminating the noise terms . for notational convenience",
    "we reorder the entries of the state vector , so that @xmath69 , and write eqs .   in the form @xmath70 . to find the fixed points of the dynamics we set the time derivatives on the left - hand side of these equations to zero ;",
    "these fixed points will be denoted by an asterisk and obey @xmath71 .",
    "it is immediately clear that there is a set of stable fixed points with @xmath72 and @xmath73 undetermined , for all @xmath5 , corresponding to a disease - free state .    for a given initial condition ,",
    "the fixed point is uniquely determined , however it may not be stable . to investigate the stability of the fixed point @xmath74 we perform a linear stability analysis .",
    "the @xmath75 stability matrix @xmath76 is defined so that near @xmath77 , the dynamics are @xmath78 , and is found to have the form @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a @xmath81 matrix with entries @xmath82 and @xmath83 is the @xmath81 unit matrix",
    ". the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath84 are straightforward to determine .",
    "any vector which has the last @xmath4 entries equal to zero is an eigenvector with eigenvalue zero , reflecting the degeneracies of the system .",
    "similarly a vector with the first @xmath4 entries set equal to zero and the last @xmath4 entries equal to @xmath85 , @xmath12 , is an eigenvector with eigenvalue @xmath86 if @xmath87 , that is , if @xmath88 .",
    "these then yield another degenerate set of @xmath89 eigenvalues @xmath86 .",
    "the final eigenvalue can be found by equating the trace of @xmath84 to the sum of its eigenvalues . in summary ,",
    "the @xmath90 eigenvalues are @xmath91 while a suitable set of corresponding eigenvectors are listed in appendix  [ sec : eve ] . from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : eva_full ] ) we see that the condition for the fixed points to be ( marginally ) stable is @xmath92    as mentioned in the introduction , there are two possible outcomes for the deterministic dynamics depending on the parameter values : either a negligible or a significant number of individuals in the population will get infected during the course of the epidemic .",
    "the quantity that determines which of these cases we are in is often referred to as the basic reproductive ratio ; the final size of the epidemic , in turn , can be obtained from the @xmath93 coordinates of the fixed point , @xmath94 . in order to determine these in the general heterogeneous case , we look first at the homogeneous case , where @xmath95 .",
    "if we set an initial condition with only a few infective individuals in an almost completely susceptible population , we will have @xmath96 and @xmath97 , where @xmath98 and @xmath99 ; with this , the @xmath37 limit of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ik ] ) takes the form @xmath100 , early in the epidemic . from this",
    "we obtain @xmath101 where @xmath102 corresponds to the basic reproductive ratio .",
    "this defines an epidemic threshold , such that for @xmath103 the number of infectives grows exponentially in the early stages of the epidemic , while for @xmath104 the epidemic does not take off and its final state corresponds to @xmath105 .    for the case",
    "when @xmath103 , we can find the @xmath93 coordinate of the fixed point by dividing eq .   by eq .   with @xmath95",
    "; this yields @xmath106 if we set again an initial condition @xmath107 , with @xmath108 , we can integrate the equation above to find @xmath109 where we have used that the final state of the epidemic corresponds to @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , to a very good approximation , we can find @xmath93 coordinate of the fixed point as the smallest solution to @xmath111 note that @xmath112 is always a solution , and the only one for @xmath104 .",
    "the total epidemic size will be given by @xmath113 , which corresponds to the fraction of recovered individuals at the end of the outbreak .",
    "this is due to the fact that the initial number of recovered individuals is zero , and that every individual that gets infected during the course of the epidemic will eventually recover and remain permanently recovered .",
    "now , a significant simplification can be made in the deterministic limit of the heterogeneous case , which reduces the @xmath90 dynamical equations to @xmath114 equations ( see refs .",
    "@xcite , which consider the static case ) .",

    " , in the case when @xmath118 , can be rewritten independently of @xmath5 as @xmath119 where we have introduced @xmath120 .",
    "if we also introduce the probability generating function of the degree distribution @xmath121 , then @xmath122 . in this reduced model , there is a line of stable fixed points , uniquely determined by the initial conditions , which satisfy @xmath123 .",
    "the stability matrix for these fixed points is the @xmath124 matrix @xmath125 which has a similar form to the stability matrix for the full system given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : j_2k_defn ] ) .",
    "once again , an eigenvector exists which has the last entry equal to zero .",
    "this corresponds to an eigenvalue zero , reflecting the existence of a line of fixed points .",
    "the trace of @xmath126 then gives the second eigenvalue , and the two eigenvalues are thus @xmath127 with the eigenvectors given in appendix  [ sec : eve ] .",
    "the stability condition is now @xmath128    now we can find analogous expressions to those in eqs .   and for the heterogeneous case .",
    "we start by noting that , in terms of @xmath129 , the total number of susceptible individuals will be given by @xmath130 it is clear that if @xmath131 , then @xmath132 ; conversely , if @xmath133 then @xmath134 , and so @xmath135 .",
    "this means that a completely susceptible population will correspond to @xmath129 being equal to unity .",

    "central to our investigation is the fact that this quantity does not have a deterministic threshold for networks characterized by power - law degree distributions in the case of interest , i.e. , when @xmath7 .    in order to find the heterogeneous final size ,",
