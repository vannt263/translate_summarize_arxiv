    "suppose the family of metric spaces with measure @xmath13 exhibits the phenomenon of concentration of measure ( is a lvy family ) : for every sequence @xmath14 of borel subsets whose measures are uniformly bounded away from zero , @xmath15 and for every @xmath16 , one has @xmath17 ( here @xmath18 denotes the @xmath19-neihbourhood of @xmath20 . )",
    "then @xmath0 is called a _ lvy group . _    let us say that a topological group @xmath0 has the _ fixed point on compacta property _ if every continuous action of @xmath0 on a compact space has a common fixed point .",
    "[ th : grm ] every lvy group has the fixed point on compacta property .",

    "notice that no locally compact group other than @xmath21 has the fixed point on compacta property ( granirer and lau @xcite ) .",
    "the known examples of lvy groups include @xmath5 @xcite , the groups @xmath22 of measurable maps from a standard lebesgue measure space to a compact group equipped with the topology of convergence in measure ( glasner @xcite , furstenberg and weiss , unpublished ) , more generally the unitary groups of hyperfinite von neumann algebras with the ultraweak topology @xcite , the group @xmath6 and various other groups of measure preserving and nonsingular transformations ( _ ibid .",

    "notice that the class of groups with the fixed point on compacta property is wider than the class of lvy groups @xcite .",

    "clearly , every whirly near - action is ergodic , but the converse is not true : for instance , no locally compact group admits non - trivial whirly near - actions .",
    "this is essentially a reformulation of a theorem due to mackey , varadarajan , and ramsay ( cf . references in @xcite ) stating that every near - action of a locally compact group has a borel ( point , spatial ) realization . on the contrary , for infinite - dimensional groups",

    "however , in those examples either the action homomorphism @xmath34 , while continuous , is not a topological embedding , or else the group @xmath0 is not polish .",

    "is @xmath0 necessarily a lvy group ?",
    "the main aim of this paper is to answer the question in the negative .",
    "we show that theorems [ th : gtwwhirly ] and [ th : gtwfixed ] can be extended to a wider class of polish groups which , while not necessarily lvy , retain a sufficient amount of concentration , witnessed by nets of probability measures that at the same time concentrate and converge to invariance .",
    "such groups need not contain any compact subgroups . among them , are the groups @xmath35 of measurable maps from a lebesgue space to an arbitrary amenable second - countable locally compact group @xmath36 .",
