    "cool giant and supergiant stars are known to present continuous mass loss process occuring at high rates , typically @xmath5",
    "m@xmath6 yr@xmath7 , but in low velocity winds ( @xmath8 km s@xmath2 ) ( dupree 1986 , lamers & cassinelli 1999 ) .",
    "after decades of theoretical and observational studies , the mechanisms in which the wind acceleration occurs are still poorly understood . due to the stellar high luminosity and low effective temperature",
    "several authors have proposed radiativelly dust driven models to explain the observed wind properties ( liberatore , lafon & berruyer 2001 , elitzur & ivezic 2001 , woitke & niccolini 2005 ) . at the pulsating phase ,",
    "acoustic waves generate high density shells that could allow dust to form near the stellar surface . in this scenario ,",
    "radiative pressure on grains transfers momentum to these particles being responsible for their acceleration and , if gas and dust are dynamically well coupled , grains drag the gas outwards resulting in the mass ejection . however , at stationary envelopes ( @xmath9 pre - agb phase ) dust driven theoretical models have lately failed in reproducing the wind properties , mainly because the dust - gas coupling is not effective ( sandin & hofner 2003 ) .",
    "observationally , guandalini @xmath10 @xmath11 ( 2005 ) found no strong correlation between the mass loss rates and the luminosities of agb stars .",
    "their main conclusion is that , if radiative pressure is important in powering these stellar winds , it must occurs in addition to other mechanism .",
    "another drawback to the radiation pressure models is the need for the dust formation region to be close to the star .",
    "recent high resolution doppler measurements show that winds are mainly accelerated near the stellar surface ( @xmath12 r@xmath13 ) ( airapetian , carpenter & ofman 2003 ) , while grains are expected to grow and survive at even larger distances .    in this sense",
    ", another mechanism must be used to accelerate the gas near surface .",
    "the most promising mechanism for the winds of cool stars is the transfer of momentum and energy to the wind from mhd waves .",
    "alfvn waves driven wind models are known to result in high velocity winds , unlike what is measured for giant cool stars , because these mhd waves are , in general , weakly damped .",
    "hartmann & macgregor ( 1980 ) showed that it would be possible to reproduce the observed low wind velocities and the high mass loss rates of the cool giant and supergiant stars if some kind of wave damping mechanism is effective at the wind basis ( @xmath14 r@xmath15 ) . in that work",
    ", they confirmed this assumption using the ion - friction damping , which has a damping length proportional to @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the wave period .",
    "holzer , fla & leer ( 1983 ) questioned this result in terms of an unnatural fine - tuning for the wave flux period , and argued that stars would , more reasonably , present a wide variety of wave frequencies depending on the generation mechanisms , and for most of them the damping would be uneffective .",
    "however , jatenco - pereira & opher ( 1989 ) studied the effects of both different damping mechanisms and the magnetic field divergence , showing that the fine - tuning of the wave period is unnecessary since there are several other damping mechanisms that would act on the frequency spectrum .",
    "also , they showed that the magnetic field divergent geometry can rapidly dilute the wave flux and also slow down the wind .",
    "their magnetic field geometry was based on empirical relations found from observations of the solar wind .",
    "this because in general , in lack of direct measurements of the magnetic field fluctuations and structure in other stars , we have to simply extrapolate our knowledge from solar observations .",
    "parker ( 1958 ) proposed that the solar wind is accelerated by the strong thermal pressure gradient in the transition region , where the gas temperature increases from @xmath18 k up to @xmath19 k. however , it became clear in the following years that neither the solar radiation , nor acoustic waves generated in the photosphere , could account for the heating of the coronal base .",
    "the origin of the energy responsible for the heating and acceleration of the plasma is believed to be from both magnetic field reconnections above the photosphere ( axford & mckenzie 1996 ) and convective motions under the stellar surface .",
    "the convective energy is transferred up to the atmosphere from the perturbations generated in the field line footpoints ( cranmer & van ballegooijen 2005 ) .",
    "these perturbations propagate outwards as alfvn waves , heating the gas as they are damped ( suzuki & inutsuka 2005 ) .",
    "regarding the magnetic field lines , holzer & leer ( 1980 ) and jatenco - pereira & opher ( 1989 ) realized that the super - radial geometry of the magnetic field funnels at the coronal holes could have a significant impact on the mass flux and wind speed .",
    "esser @xmath10 @xmath11 ( 2005 ) , showed that the models considering highly diverging magnetic funnels explain better the observed data for the sun .",
    "also , tu @xmath10 @xmath11 ( 2005 ) established that the solar wind acceleration initiates in the magnetic funnels at heights lower than @xmath20 cm , coincident with the high divergence region .    in this work , we model the acceleration and heating of a late - type supergiant stellar wind considering an outward flux of alfvn waves .",
    "we solve the mhd equations to , self - consistently , determine the magnetic field geometry and the wind temperature , density and velocity profiles . in section 2",
    ", we describe the model basic equations . in section 3",
    "we present the results and the discussions , followed , by the work conclusions .",
    "the wind equations are based on mass , momentum , energy and magnetic flux conservation .",
    "the first is given by : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the flow velocity , @xmath23 is the gas density and @xmath24 is the flow cross - section area at a distance @xmath25 from the center of the star .",
    "the index ",
    "@xmath26 \" indicates the variable is being evaluated at the stellar surface ( @xmath27 ) .    assuming a steady flow , the momentum equation can be written as : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the thermal pressure",
    ", @xmath30 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath31 is the gas temperature , @xmath32 is the mean mass per particle , @xmath33 the gravitational constant and @xmath34 the wave magnetic field amplitude . in equation ( 2 ) , the right hand side contains the gravitational force density and the thermal and wave pressure gradients , respectively .",
    "the last two terms represent the lorentz force . the wave amplitude ( @xmath34 ) is related to the wave energy density ( @xmath35 ) by @xmath36 .      typically ,",
    "considering magnetic field strengths @xmath37 g , the wind basis is characterized by the relation @xmath38 , @xmath39 the plasma is magnetically dominated . in this case , if we assume the wind to be initiated at funnels anchored at the stellar surface , which are surrounded by a plasma with lower magnetic field strength , the magnetic pressure inside will push the gas and the funnel field lines will expand .",
    "the funnel cross - section radius ( @xmath40 ) will grow super - radially up to a limit value ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "this limiting cross - section radius depends both on the relation between external and internal magnetic field strengths and on the filling factor ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "as the area increases , the internal magnetic strength diminishes until the equilibrium between internal and external magnetic pressures is reached . if the internal magnetic field strength is much larger than the external , the flux tubes cross - section will depend on the filling factor only .",
    "the filling factor is the ratio between the area of the stellar surface covered by funnels and the total area .",
    "the averaged maximum area that a funnel could reach would be @xmath43 or , in terms of the cross section radius : @xmath44 for the quiet sun , the funnels that merge to form the coronal holes cover about 10% of the total surface .    to evaluate the tube expansion at the wind basis ,",
    "we assume the plasma to be magnetically dominated and the left hand side of equation ( 2 ) may be neglected if compared to the other terms . then , by using @xmath45 and a power series expansion method proposed by pneuman , solanki & stenflo ( 1986 ) , we can determine self - consistently the magnetic field geometry without assuming any empirical function for the funnel cross - section with distance .",
    "following pneuman , solanki & stenflo ( 1986 ) , using the thin fluxtube aproximation , equation ( 2 ) and @xmath45 are described near stellar surface by : @xmath46 @xmath47 and @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the scale height .",
    "expanding all variables as power series in @xmath50 ( @xmath39 along the tube radius ) , and neglecting terms of orders higher than 2 , equations ( 4 ) @xmath51 ( 6 ) give rise to a differential equation for the fluxtube cross section : @xmath52 =   \\nonumber \\\\",

    "@xmath53 , @xmath42 is the filling factor and @xmath54 is the magnetic field strength outside the fluxtube . in the following calculations we fixed its value to be @xmath55 .    to simplify the set of equations",
    ", we will define the funnel area expansion as a function of radial distance by : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the expansion index , which is super - radial ( s @xmath0 2 ) at the wind basis up to the merging radius when @xmath57 becomes 2 .",
    "@xmath57 is determined from equation ( 7 ) .",
    "falceta - gonalves & jatenco - pereira ( 2002 ) showed that , even though presenting low effective temperatures , the temperature gradients at the wind basis of late - type supergiant stars could play an important role in accelerating the gas , as occurs in the sun . in their model ,",
    "the temperature profile was assumed to be a @xmath25 dependent function , obtained from observational data .",
    "the wind temperatures in giant cool stars are expected to increase from the photosferic value up to @xmath58 k , much lower than what is observed for the sun , but still important in the wind acceleration if the gradient occurs in small lengthscales . from their calculations",
    ", falceta - gonalves & jatenco - pereira ( 2002 ) also showed that the thermal pressure is even more important than radiation pressure at the non - pulsating phase of these objects .    in a consistent model , to avoid assuming any empirical function for the magnetic field geometry and to determine the wind temperature at each wind position ( @xmath25 ) , we have to solve the energy equation , which is determined from the balance between wave heating and the adiabatic expansion and radiative coolings ( hartmann , edwards & avrett 1982 ; vidotto & jatenco - pereira 2006 ) .",
    "thus , neglecting conduction , we write the energy equation as : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the wave energy density , which is described below ( sec .",
    "2.3 ) , @xmath61 is the wave heating rate , @xmath39 the rate at which the gas is being heated due to dissipation of wave energy , and @xmath62 is the radiative cooling rate , both in erg  @xmath63  s@xmath2 . the wave heating can be written as : @xmath64 and the radiative cooling is given by : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the electron density , @xmath67 is the hydrogen density and @xmath68 is the radiative loss function . here , we adopt the @xmath69 function given by schmutzler & tscharnuter ( 1993 ) and calculate @xmath66 with the modified saha equation given by hartmann & macgregor ( 1980 )",
    ".      the wave energy density at each step may be calculated , using a wkb aproximation , from the wave action conservation . under this assumption ,",
    "the wave energy density is dissipated as follows : @xmath70 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the alfvn - mach number , @xmath72 the alfvn speed and @xmath73 the wave damping length .",
    "also , the wave flux ( @xmath74 ) at @xmath75 is evaluated by ( jatenco - pereira & opher 1989 ) : @xmath76    actually , the wkb aproximation is not valid when the perturbation wavelength is much larger than the gradients lengthscales of the system , @xmath9 when @xmath77 @xmath73 . as a consequence , part of the wave flux",
    "is reflected and the alfvn waves propagating on opposite directions decay as the generated beat waves interact with the gas particles . davila ( 1985 ) pointed out that , in the sun , the gradients of the coronal parameters are high enough to make the wkb aproximation not applicable . however , usmanov @xmath10 @xmath11 ( 2000 ) found good agreement between the observational data and models with this approach . in this model",
    ", we used equation ( 12 ) assuming then linear perturbations , however included non - linear effects in the damping length function ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the non - linear damping length is given by ( jatenco - pereira & opher 1989 ) : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the averaged squared perturbation velocity amplitude and @xmath81 is the damping length at the wind basis , which is mainly dependent on the assumed wave frequency spectrum ( lagage & cesarsky 1983 ) . here",
    ", we will let it as a free parameter .",
    "finally , once the magnetic field structure is determined , we evaluate the temperature and velocity of the wind along the magnetic field . using the equation ( 8) and considering the magnetic flux conservation , equations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 9 ) in the radial direction",

    "we show the main results by applying these equations in a typical cool supergiant star and compare them with previous works .",
    "for the last decades , the validity of a wind model was constrained in reproducing only both the terminal velocity and the mass - loss rate of a given star . as a consequence",
    ", a number of accelerating mechanisms were found in accordance to observations of these constrains",
    ". however , with the high resolution observations and more sensitive intruments the parameters radial profiles will become measurable and will be decisive on the modelling choice .",
    "here we determine the velocity , density and temperature profiles and discuss their dependence on initial assumptions .",
    "we applied the described model on a cool supergiant star with @xmath84 = 16 m@xmath85 , @xmath86 r@xmath1 , @xmath87 g @xmath63 , @xmath88 g and @xmath89 k. we also assumed a filling factor @xmath90 , according to solar observations .",

    "the magnetic field structure is shown in figure ( 1 ) .",
    "the solid line represents the solution of equation ( 7 ) for the given stellar parameters , compared to a simple constant expansion factor @xmath93 ( dashed line ) , as used by falceta - gonalves & jatenco - pereira ( 2002 ) . comparing both curves",
    "we find that the self - consistent geometry is more divergent near stellar surface , and the flux tubes are expected to merge at lower distances , in agreement with more refined models for the sun ( esser @xmath94 @xmath11 2005 ) .",
    "we obtained an initial value of @xmath95 , that decreases with distance to the stellar surface . from the assumed @xmath42",
    ", we found that the neighbour fluxtubes merge at @xmath96 r@xmath4 . at this point , with a sudden decrease of @xmath57 from its super - radial value to @xmath97 ( radial ) , the wind properties change and it is noticeable as breaks in the temperature , density and velocity profiles .",
    "we obtained the same geometry for the following calculations considering different initial parameters .",
    "this because the super - radial magnetic field geometry occurs mainly at the wind basis , where the magnetic pressure is highly dominant . in this sense",
    ", we expect the expansion index ( @xmath57 ) to be independent on the other initial parameters such as the wind velocity , the wave flux densities and the damping length .    in figure",
    "( 2 ) we compare the wind velocity profiles for the different initial damping lengths . as expected , the larger the damping length the higher is the wind velocity .",
    "however , for previous works that do not take into account any high initial divergence , the wind velocity is even larger . the obtained divergence result in a fast dilution of the wave energy density near the stellar surface . as a consequence , the lack of wave flux at larger distances results in lower velocities .",
    "this result shows that even low damped wave fluxes can be responsible for low terminal velocities , depending on the field divergence .",

    "all three lines show the same behaviour at @xmath100 1.5 r@xmath4 indicating that the flux tube divergence is the dominant factor if comparing to the gas expansion due to acceleration .",
    "this is an interesting result since , typically , the density profile is believed to be closely related to the velocity profile only . in figure",
    "( 4 ) , we notice that , in despite of what was obtained in previous works , the wave energy density is weakly dependent on the initial damping length at the wind basis .",
    "this mainly because , again , the field divergence is dominant on the dilution process . on the other hand , for distances larger than the flux tubes merging position the wave damping",
    "is dominant . in figure",
    "( 5 ) , the temperature profiles show different features . for the given stellar parameters ,",
    "if @xmath101  r@xmath4 , the wave heating is less effective and the radiative losses added to the expansion cooling result in a negative temperature gradient , which occurs in a very narrow region until the density becomes low enough for the radiative losses become less important . for highly damped waves , the wave heating dominates the radiative losses and the temperature gradient is positive near the surface .",
    "another interesting feature is the maximum temperature position .",
    "since the temperature gradient is mainly dependent on the wave damping ( @xmath102 @xmath61 parameter ) , we notice that the lower is the damping length , the closer to the stellar surface the maximum temperature occurs .",

    "for the larger magnetic field strength ( @xmath108 g ) we obtained the higher terminal velocity ( @xmath109 km s@xmath2 ) .",
    "this effect is mainly due to the higher wave energy flux assumed at the wind basis to accomplish the same relative wave amplitude .",
    "the temperature profiles , shown in figure ( 7 ) , also present features dependent on the magnetic field strength . as for the velocity , a high wave energy flux results in a high temperature , at least near the stellar surface due to the higher energy density .",

    "<S> cool stars at giant and supergiant evolutionary phases present low velocity and high density winds , responsible for the observed high mass - loss rates . although presenting high luminosities , radiation pressure on dust particles is not sufficient to explain the wind acceleration process . among the possible solutions to this still unsolved problem , </S>",
    "<S> alfvn waves are , probably , the most interesting for their high efficiency in transfering energy and momentum to the wind . </S>",
    "<S> typically , models of alfvn wave driven winds result in high velocity winds if they are not highly damped . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we determine self - consistently the magnetic field geometry and solve the momentum , energy and mass conservation equations , to demonstrate that even a low damped alfvn wave flux is able to reproduce the low velocity wind . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the magnetic fluxtubes expand with a super - radial factor s @xmath0 30 near the stellar surface , larger than that used in previous semi - empirical models . the rapid expansion results in a strong spatial dilution of the wave flux . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained the wind parameter profiles for a typical supergiant star of 16 m@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the wind is accelerated in a narrow region , coincident with the region of high divergence of the magnetic field lines , up to 100 km s@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> for the temperature , we obtained a slight decrease near the surface for low damped waves , because the wave heating mechanism is less effective than the radiative losses . </S>",
    "<S> the peak temperature occurs at @xmath3 r@xmath4 reaching 6000 k. propagating outwards , the wind cools down mainly due to adiabatic expansion .    </S>",
