    "the quantum numbers of the possible pentaquark state @xmath5 is object of intensive experimental and theoretical considerations .",
    "in particular , the p - parity of this baryon is important in order to disentangle different models @xcite .    in principle ,",
    "specific polarization phenomena in different reactions , such as @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath10 @xcite , @xmath11 @xcite ... , can constitute the tool for an adequate and model independent way for the determination of the p - parity of the @xmath12-hyperon .",
    "however , the above listed reactions can be used only if one knows some other quantum numbers of @xmath12 , such as the spin , or , in some cases , the isospin . in general , the mass and the total width do not eneter in such considerations . in the reactions involving the @xmath13-meson ( in initial or in final states ) the p - parity of the @xmath13 meson has to be known .",
    "a typical assumption is that the k - meson is pseudoscalar , following the quark model , but , up to now , there are only indirect experimental indications .",
    "we may remind that , in the beginning of photo and electroproduction studies , both values were considered in the interpretation of the data , @xcite .",
    "this problem is crucial in the context of the @xmath12-classification , as the main @xmath2-decay , @xmath14 , being a strong decay , is controlled by the kaon p - parity .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to generalize the analysis of the determination of the p = parity of the @xmath2-baryon , produced in the simplest reactions of the @xmath15-interaction , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , to the case of an arbitrary spin of the @xmath2 hyperon .",
    "this analysis can be done in a model independent form , using the basic symmetry properties of the strong interaction , and does not need any specific dynamical assumptions for the above mentioned processes .",
    "this problem has been also analyzed in frame of a different formalism @xcite .",
    "the central point of this analysis is based on the observation that there is a kinematical region near the reaction threshold , where the final baryons are produced in s - state .",
    "this region has an extension in the variable @xmath16 ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the square of the total energy of the colliding nucleons , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the masses of the produced hyperons ) , which is related to the finite radius of the strong interaction .",
    "note that , for the production of strange particles , in nn - collisions , such radius is expected to be of the order of @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the kaon mass .",
    "therefore , the corresponding threshold region , with s - wave production , is expected to quite wide .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we consider the production of @xmath2-baryon with @xmath23 .",
    "we establish the spin structure of the threshold matrix elements for @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and analyze double spin polarization observables , sensitive to the parity of the @xmath2-hyperon .",
    "the generalization on the case of any spin of the @xmath2-hyperon is done in section iii .",

    "the polarization transfer coefficient from the initial nucleon ( beam or target ) to the produced @xmath32 hyperon , is relatively easy to measure , because the @xmath4 and the @xmath3-hyperons are self - analyzing particles .    note , in this respect , that the disto collaboration showed the feasibility of this method , by measuring the @xmath33 coefficient at proton momentum of 3.67 gev / c , which showed that _",
    "`` @xmath33 is large and negative ( @xmath34 ) over most of the kinematic region '' _",
    "it was mentioned in @xcite that a nonzero value of @xmath33 , in the threshold region , can be considered as the experimental confirmation of the pseudoscalar nature of the @xmath35 meson .",
    "polarization effects in @xmath24 for @xmath36 , have been studied earlier @xcite , where it was shown that at least two observables , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are sensitive to the parity of the @xmath2-hyperon , in different ways for @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "a similar derivation will be done for a more complicated case , @xmath23 , in the following sections .",
    "[ [ section ] ] ~    the selection rules with respect to the strong interaction allow a single threshold partial transition : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) are the total spin and angular orbital momentum of the initial ( final ) baryons , @xmath44 is the total angular momentum and p - parity of the colliding nucleons .",
    "we assume , all along this work , that the isotopic spin of the @xmath2-hyperon is equal to zero .",
    "therefore the transition ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) results from the generalized pauli principle .",
    "the corresponding matrix element can be written as : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the unit vector along the three momentum of the colliding nucleons , in the reaction cm system , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the two - component spinors of the initial nucleons , @xmath49 is the two - component spinor of the produced @xmath50 hyperon and @xmath51 is the two - component spinor with vector index @xmath52 , describing the polarization properties of the @xmath2 with spin 3/2 , obeying to the following condition : @xmath53 and , finally , @xmath54 is the partial amplitude for the singlet @xmath55 interaction .",

    "it is straightforward to show that all polarization transfer coefficients , characterizing the dependence of the polarization of any final baryon on the polarization of any initial nucleon , vanish .",
    "the physical reason is that the singlet @xmath55-state , being closed with respect to both nucleon spins , does not contain and does not transmit any information on the polarization to the final baryons .    therefore the predictions : @xmath59 @xmath60 are typical properties for negative p - parity @xmath2-production for @xmath61 in the threshold region .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ] ~    the symmetry selection rules ( p - invariance , conservation of the total angular momentum and the validity of the generalized pauli principle ) result in the following three partial transitions : @xmath62 the corresponding matrix element can be written as : @xmath63 ( \\chi_m^{\\dagger } \\sigma_y\\tilde \\chi_3^{\\dagger})+,\\label{eq : mpl}\\\\ & & if^{(+)}_{3\\lambda}\\left [ \\tilde \\chi_2   \\sigma_y(\\vec\\sigma\\times\\hat{\\vec k})_m\\chi_1 \\right ] ( \\vec\\chi^{\\dagger}\\cdot\\hat{\\vec k}\\sigma_m\\sigma_y \\tilde\\chi_3^{\\dagger}),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 , @xmath65 are the partial amplitudes for the case of positive parity of the @xmath2 hyperon .",
    "note that the amplitude @xmath66 describes the triplet @xmath55-interaction in a state with zero value of total spin projection , but the amplitudes @xmath67 describe the @xmath55 interaction with total spin projection equal to @xmath68 .",

    "one can find from ( [ eq : sigpp ] ) : @xmath74 which is different from the case of negative p - parity .",
    "the same conclusion holds for the case of the coefficients of polarization transfer .",

    "the final result for the considered mechanism can be written as : @xmath84 let us stress that these predictions do not depend on the values of the coupling constants @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and on the phenomenological form factors which are important ingredients of this model .",

    "another confirmation of the validity of this simple model , which takes into account only @xmath13-exchange for threshold strange particle production in @xmath91-collisions is the large value of the ratio @xmath92 , measured in cosy @xcite .    considering the similarity of final states in @xmath93 and in the reaction of interest here , @xmath94",
