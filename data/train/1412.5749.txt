    "in the @xmath1 cold dark matter ( @xmath1cdm ) model , @xmath2 per cent of the energy content of the universe consists of a mass component with no optical counterpart .",
    "thus , this component is called dark matter ( dm ) and understanding its nature is among the prime goals of modern cosmology .",
    "one of the most promising candidates for this matter component is the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) , produced as a thermal relic in the early universe .",
    "in addition to its gravitational influence on astrophysical objects , the nature of dm can be explored through direct and indirect detection methods .",
    "assuming that dm is made up of majorana particles implies that it could self - annihilate , which would give rise to standard model particles that can be detected with ordinary observatories .",
    "thus , this method is called the indirect detection method and is the target of this work .",
    "gamma - rays , in contrast to charged cosmic rays , are not deflected by magnetic fields , and thus trace back to their origin . searching for dm with gamma - rays is therefore among the most promising methods to probe the nature of dm .",
    "typical targets for observations are astrophysical objects with high dm densities , such as the galactic centre @xcite , dwarf galaxies @xcite or galaxy clusters @xcite , and the diffuse gamma - ray background ( dgrb ; * ? ? ?",
    "dm annihilation may contribute to the total intensity of the dgrb , but could also , due to its presence in gravitationally collapsed structures , exhibit a detectable anisotropy pattern @xcite .",
    "in particular , recent high - resolution n - body simulations of a milky way like halo , such as via lactea ii @xcite and aquarius @xcite , have been used to study the population of dm substructure , called dm subhaloes , of the milky way halo .",
    "in addition to subhaloes currently resolved by simulations , it is expected that subhaloes can form on much smaller scales .",
    "this minimum self - bound halo mass is often assumed to be @xmath3 , but its precise value depends on the particular dm model @xcite .",
    "this population of subhaloes can dramatically increase the degree of anisotropy of the gamma - ray emission from galactic dm @xcite .",
    "the excellent performance of the large area telescope ( lat ; * ? ? ? * ) on board the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope , in particular its unprecedented angular resolution , began a new era in gamma - ray astronomy and indirect dm searches .",
    "recently , the _",
    "fermi_-lat collaboration has measured an excess in the dgrb anisotropy in the multipole range @xmath4 and in the energy range from @xmath5 to @xmath6 @xcite . with common astrophysical sources , such as active galactic nuclei @xcite and , in particular , blazars @xcite ,",
    "being expected to produce the bulk of this excess , these measurements can be used to constrain the dm self - annihilation cross - section , @xmath0 @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we aim to compare the limits implied by the anisotropy to those from the intensity and detected sources in the lat 2-yr point source catalog ( 2fgl ; * ? ? ?",
    "we describe in detail the impact of different dm density profiles and the role of the detection threshold for subhaloes on the anisotropy power spectrum ( aps ) of the galactic dm emission .",
    "the former one has recently been discussed in @xcite , though with a greatly increased mass resolution we get qualitatively very different results .",
    "the latter effect , the role of the detection threshold of individual subhaloes , has , at least to our knowledge , not been discussed for the sensitivity of the study in @xcite .",
    "however , we find it to have a huge impact on both the shape and the normalization of the aps from dm . taking this into account , we find significantly weaker limits on the self - annihilation cross - section , @xmath0 , than those previously reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "ultimately , our results show that a detectable anisotropy signature from galactic dm would severely violate observations of the intensity of the dgrb and detected sources .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : galactic dark matter annihilation ] , we review the dm annihilation process in the milky way and describe our particular method for generating the all - sky gamma - ray template maps . section [ sec : dark matter power spectra ] presents the results of our simulation , focusing on the role of different dm density profiles and cosmic variance . in section [ sec : comparison with observations ] , we compare our theoretical model with observations of the anisotropy , the intensity , and detected sources in the dgrb .",
    "we present a simplified model for our conclusions in section [ sec : analytical model ] .",
    "finally , we summarize the main points of our work in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the gamma - ray flux , the number of detected gamma - rays per unit angle , unit time , unit area , and energy , from dm annihilation is given by @xmath7 where @xmath0 is the self - annihilation cross - section , @xmath8 the wimp mass , @xmath9 the dm density , @xmath10 is the annihilation gamma - ray spectrum of dm and @xmath11 the comoving distance .",
    "the integral is performed along the line of sight of the coordinates @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we neglect any velocity dependence of the self - annihilation cross - section and assume it to be constant ( s - wave annihilation ) .",
    "furthermore , we assume annihilation into @xmath14 throughout this paper .",
    "we calculate the annihilation spectrum , @xmath10 , for the wimp with ` darksusy ` @xcite and model the galactic dm density from the results of the high - resolution via lactea ii simulation @xcite .",

    "this model gives a local dm density of @xmath21 , matching the value reported in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1cdm model predicts a hierarchical structure formation process in which low - mass haloes form first .",
    "these small haloes could merge and become subhaloes of the main halo .",
    "this additional substructure boosts the overall annihilation rate due to @xmath22 and could induce an anisotropy pattern . in this work",
    ", we use the publicly available subhalo catalogue of the via lactea ii simulation @xcite .",
    "we only consider haloes with tidal mass @xmath23 bigger than @xmath24 and a maximum circular velocity @xmath25 greater than @xmath26 at @xmath27 to avoid possible numerical effects .",
    "altogether , roughly @xmath28 subhaloes with this criterion are identified within a radius of @xmath20 around the galactic centre . for every subhalo , the maximum circular velocity @xmath25 , the corresponding radius @xmath29 , the tidal mass @xmath23 , the tidal radius @xmath30 , and the position",
    "are given .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the values of @xmath25 and @xmath29 can be affected by the gravitational softening length @xmath31 .",
    "thus , we apply a correction to those values to take this into account ( see @xcite , for details ) .",
    "besides the einasto profile , we also consider the navarro , frenk & white ( nfw ) profile @xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are free parameters for each subhalo .",
    "we use the @xmath25 and @xmath29 values of each halo to fit the dm distribution to different density profiles .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath35 and @xmath36 for the nfw profile , where @xmath37 .",
    "similarly , one finds for the different einasto profiles @xmath38 and @xmath39 for @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "here , @xmath42 is the gamma function and @xmath43 is the lower incomplete gamma function .",
    "all the profiles have the same value at @xmath29 , but make very different predictions for the behaviour near the centre of the subhalo . for the einasto profile with @xmath44 ,",
    "the density reaches a constant value shortly after @xmath29 .",
    "on the other hand , the einasto profile with @xmath45 and the nfw profile predict much higher central densities .",
    "while the density of the main halo can be resolved down to radii smaller than @xmath46 @xcite , the behaviour near the centre is much more uncertain for the subhaloes .",
    "thus , the different profiles described here are a good representation of possible behaviours of the density profile inside @xmath29 . besides the density near the core , the different profiles also give different values for the density outside of @xmath29 .",
    "these densities could , in principle , be resolved and certain profiles might give a bad fit to n - body simulations .",
    "but the annihilation rate outside of @xmath29 is negligible for every profile .",
    "thus , it is justified to use these different profiles for all radii , even if they might not accurately predict the density outside of @xmath29 .      despite the excellent mass resolution in via lactea ii",
    ", subhaloes can form at much smaller scales @xcite .",
    "it is thus important to quantify the possible effect of subhaloes below the resolution limit of the simulation . here",
    ", a monte carlo approach is used to simulate a population of subhaloes down to a mass of @xmath47 . below this mass",
    ", the subhaloes are modelled with a substructure boost factor .",

    "thus , this model predicts higher concentrations of subhaloes close to the galactic centre .",
    "additionally , a gaussian scatter of @xmath65 is applied to the concentration parameter in the monte carlo simulation @xcite .",

    "is motivated by the finding that the spatial number density is independent of the subhalo mass @xcite .",

    "all subhaloes generated are accepted . on the other hand , in the mass range from @xmath71 to @xmath72 , additional subhaloes are only accepted if they have a maximum circular velocity @xmath73 to prevent double counting of dense subhaloes .",
    "the resulting @xmath29-@xmath25 distribution smoothly extends the relation found in the simulation .",

    "the role of the density profile on the dm anisotropies has recently been discussed by @xcite .",
    "the authors used the results of the n - body counterparts of the magicc simulation suite to estimate the galactic dm signal .",
    "they used different parametrizations to fit the dm density profiles of the galactic smooth halo and its subhaloes .",
    "these were the nfw profile , the einasto profile and the s&m - profile @xcite .",

    "the analytical fits to these profiles were then used to construct all - sky gamma - ray maps .",
    "the authors show that the fluctuation angular power spectrum changes by ` huge amounts ' when using different density profiles to describe the simulation results . however , it is important to point out that the n - body simulation used by @xcite does only resolve subhaloes down to a minimum mass of @xmath90 .",
    "it is necessary to ask how this picture changes when analysing a broader mass range .",
    "we have simulated the galactic dm signal for the same subhalo population using the different einasto profiles with @xmath45 , @xmath91 , and @xmath41 and without any mask .",
    "the anisotropy power spectra associated with these three different profiles are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : profilesanisotropy ] .",
    "when considering only subhaloes with a mass down to @xmath85 , we see huge differences between the density profiles . in particular , at a multipole of @xmath92 , the difference is more than three orders of magnitude .",
    "the dm density profile affects both the shape and the normalization of the power spectrum , consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "however , for the entire subhalo population down to a minimum mass of @xmath47 the differences decrease substantially . for cored profiles , such as einasto with @xmath44",
    ", high - mass haloes do not inject strong anisotropies on small angular scales . in this case",
    ", the low - mass haloes provide the bulk of the anisotropy on small scales .",
    "in contrast , for cuspy profiles , like einasto with @xmath45 , most of the small - scale power already comes from high - mass haloes .",
    "thus , taking only high - mass subhaloes into account , as done by @xcite , likely overestimates the effect of the radial profile .",
    "especially the shape of the power spectrum is hardly affected by the choice of the radial profile .",
    "realizations of the galactic gamma - ray map .",
    "the particle physics parameters are the same as in figs [ fig : galacticflux ] and [ fig : profilesanisotropy ] and the nfw profile is used .",

    "we vary the position of the observer with respect to the galactic centre , while keeping a distance of @xmath96 from the galactic centre .",
    "the dm density profile of the subhaloes is given by an nfw profile .",
    "additionally , we mask low galactic latitudes ( @xmath97 ) and @xmath98 radius around each source in the 1fgl catalogue , as done in @xcite .",
    "this gives @xmath99 .",

    "the results of this analysis are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : variance ] . for the low multipoles ( @xmath101 ) ,",
    "the variance is negligible because the main contribution to the anisotropies comes from the smooth galactic halo .",
    "the anisotropy signal of the smooth halo , as shown by the grey line , does also have power on small angular scales .",
    "the features , however , are not intrinsic anisotropy features , but spurious remnants of the mask itself . for the multipole range of interest ( @xmath4 ) ,",
    "the anisotropy signal is dominated by galactic substructure and , ultimately , affected by the low number of galactic high - mass subhaloes . the statistical uncertainty in terms of the @xmath94 per cent containment spans around one order of magnitude for @xmath102 .",
    "the variance decreases slightly for higher multipoles , which can be understood by the fact that rare , high - mass haloes have a smaller anisotropy contribution @xcite .",
    "however , there is a high - anisotropy end for large multipoles that is due to very close encounters with dense nearby subhaloes .",
    "we also observe that different multipoles are highly correlated .",
    "thus , differences in the realizations do not decrease significantly when averaging over a multipole range .",
    "however , for the remainder of this work , we will neglect this source of uncertainty .",
    "the reason is that the variance is caused by the most luminous subhaloes .",
    "as we will show in the next chapter , these subhaloes are too bright to cause a detectable anisotropy in the data of @xcite without being individually detected .",
    "we also note that these power spectra match the ones presented in @xcite , where aquarius has been used to construct the all - sky maps , quite well .",
    "the anisotropies in our model are only slightly higher .",
    "@xcite have recently measured the anisotropy in the dgrb . they analysed the anisotropies in the energy ranges @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 and in the multipole range @xmath4 .",
    "an analysis of lower multipoles is hindered by contamination with galactic diffuse emission , while the upper limit is due to the angular reconstruction of the _ fermi_-lat .",
    "@xcite report an excess in angular power in all energy bins .",
    "moreover , @xcite have estimated the contribution of unresolved blazars .",
    "thus , one can use the residual anisotropy to place limits on the contribution of other unresolved source populations , e.g. dm annihilation .",
    "recently , @xcite have estimated the anisotropy originating from all unresolved agns combined . while the predicted anisotropies are slightly higher , they come with a higher uncertainty .",
    "thus , they likely lead to a comparable residual anisotropy . in the following discussion",
    ", we will assume a wimp mass of @xmath107 , annihilation into @xmath76 and an nfw density profile for the galactic subhaloes .",
    "we will show how the masking of bright subhaloes affects the signature of dm annihilation as anisotropies in the dgrb .",
    "the results are qualitatively very similar for other particle physics parameters and dm density profiles .      for the measurement of the gamma - ray anisotropy in @xcite , sources in the lat 1-yr point source catalog ( 1fgl ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been masked .",
    "this catalogue contains several unassociated sources that could , in principle , be dm subhaloes . thus , it is necessary to exclude dm subhaloes from the anisotropy calculation that exceed the threshold for individual detection .",
    "we follow @xcite and adopt a detection threshold @xmath108 of @xmath109 for @xmath110 .",
    "@xcite showed that the detection threshold in this energy range is mostly independent of the underlying spectral shape in case of power - law emitters . using the analytical estimate of @xcite ,",
    "we have verified that this is also the case for the gamma - ray spectrum of @xmath111 . for this calculation",
    ", we used the estimate of the dgrb and the galactic diffuse emission presented in @xcite and the p6 v3 diffuse instrument response functions of the _ fermi_-lat . for low dm masses ,",
    "we find that the above value is a very good approximation , while the detection threshold for dm masses above @xmath112 should be slightly lower . for simplicity and easy comparison",
    ", we will assume the above - mentioned detection threshold for all dm masses .",
    "we will later explore how our results are affected by different choices of the detection threshold .",
    "there are , in principle , two important caveats to keep in mind when calculating the detection threshold according to @xcite .",
    "first , this detection threshold is valid for point sources , whereas some subhaloes have a non - negligible angular extent . this could , in principle , increase the detection threshold . however , only the brightest subhaloes have a large angular size and the flux of these subhaloes is significantly above the threshold for a detectable anisotropy signal .",
    "all the remaining subhaloes have a negligible angular size , and thus can be treated as point sources .",
    "secondly , the detection algorithm of the 1fgl assumes a power - law spectrum for the sources and is not optimized for dm sources .",
    "however , the 1fgl catalogue contains several pulsars that have a spectrum that is very similar to dm annihilation into @xmath14 @xcite . for galactic latitudes of @xmath113 , the same region as for the anisotropy measurements , the catalogue contains six pulsars with @xmath114 and nine with @xmath115 . if we assume that pulsars follow a power - law source count distribution with index @xmath116 ( compare @xcite ) , these numbers are perfectly compatible with a detection threshold of @xmath117 .",
    "moreover , the more sensitive 2fgl catalogue reports no additional pulsars above @xmath118 . finally , the spectra of most of the faint pulsars can not be distinguished from power - law spectra .",
    "it is thus unlikely that the spectral shape degrades the detection efficiency of dm subhaloes dramatically .",
    "previously , @xcite estimated the effect of the masking of bright subhaloes and found only a few detectable subhaloes for an observable anisotropy . however , the estimated detection threshold was much higher than the one of the 1fgl .",
    "@xcite assumed a threshold of @xmath119 for gamma - rays above @xmath120 and 5 years of observation .",
    "the first _ fermi_-lat catalog of sources above @xmath120 ( 1fhl ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) reports a substantially lower detection threshold of @xmath121 for only @xmath122 years of observation .",
    "additionally , the 1fgl catalogue uses the entire energy range of the _",
    "fermi_-lat , and thus has an even better detection efficiency .",
    "moreover , @xcite assumed that the anisotropy can be measured at @xmath123 , where we would have a much better signal - to - noise ratio than in the range @xmath4 .",
    "since this is not possible due to galactic foreground emission , a detectable anisotropy signal necessarily requires a higher self - annihilation cross - section , and thus more detectable subhaloes .       and @xmath124 as a function of the cross - section , @xmath0 .",

    "let us finally remark that the theoretical model in @xcite produces many more bright subhaloes than our model .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath144 from subhalo searches reported in @xcite is not excluded for our theoretical predictions .",
    "finally , the @xmath94 per cent cl upper limits on the annihilation cross - section into @xmath76 from the analysis of the anisotropies of galactic subhaloes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : limits ] . for each mass ,",
    "the upper limit is derived as the best upper limit in any of the four energy bins of the non - blazar anisotropy reported in @xcite .",
    "for reference , the upper limits derived when neglecting the masking of bright subhaloes is shown as a dotted line .",
    "we also show the individual limits from each energy bin as thin dashed lines .",
    "these constraints roughly match the limits presented in @xcite .",
    "however , when taking the masking of bright subhaloes into account , as shown by the solid line , the limits increase by a factor of @xmath145 .",
    "the correction is slightly lower for very high wimp masses . in this case",
    ", the annihilation of dm into @xmath14 produces very hard spectra .",
    "thus , the detection threshold , @xmath108 , should be lower than for lighter dm particles and the effect of subhalo masking stronger than shown in fig .",

    "cl upper limits for the dm annihilation cross - section into @xmath14 implied by galactic substructure and the anisotropy of the dgrb . ]",
    "it is important to point out that the calculation of anisotropies , intensity , and detectable subhaloes from dm annihilation is subject to strong extrapolations beyond the range of n - body simulations , halo - to - halo variations of the substructure abundance or uncertainties in the mass of the milky way halo .",
    "thus , one can ask whether the failure of the anisotropy analysis to provide competitive constraints on the annihilation cross - section is confined to via lactea ii or our particular assumptions .",
    "we want to address this question with a simplified version of the analytical model presented in @xcite .",
    "we choose this model for its simplicity and physical insight and refer the reader to @xcite for a more sophisticated treatment .",
    "the small - scale anisotropy from dm annihilation is dominated by the so - called one - subhalo term @xcite .",
    "generically , we can write its magnitude as @xmath146 where @xmath133 is the flux of a source in a particular energy interval , @xmath147 the total number of sources above a certain flux @xmath133 , @xmath108 the detection threshold , @xmath148 a k - correction factor due to the fact that the luminosity and the anisotropy are not measured in the same energy range , and @xmath149 a suppression factor due to angular extension . we will approximate this suppression factor with unity since we have already shown that sources below the detection threshold have a negligible angular extent . assuming that the source count distribution @xmath150 follows a power - law relation , @xmath151 , with index @xmath152 , the total small - scale anisotropy is @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the normalization of the subhalo source count distribution that depends on the milky way mass and the self - annihilation cross - section .",
    "conversely , the number of sources above a certain flux @xmath155 is @xmath156 by changing the annihilation cross - section , we can fix the anisotropy level to the residual anisotropy @xmath157 .",
    "this then determines the total number of subhaloes above a certain flux @xmath155 , @xmath158 thus , the number of detected subhaloes for a detectable anisotropy is independent of the actual normalization of the substructure abundance . thus , assuming self - similarity , it does also not depend on the milky way mass .",
    "instead , it only depends on the index @xmath152 of the source count distribution . for our model",
    "we get @xmath159 . using @xmath160 , @xmath155 = @xmath142 , and @xmath161 , we get @xmath162 at @xmath138 , in excellent agreement with the value shown in fig . [",
    "fig : example_sources ] .",
    "we also see that the number of detected sources scales with @xmath163 .",
    "thus , even for a very high detection threshold of @xmath164 , the observations of individually detected sources in the 2fgl would still be violated .     of the subhalo to the observer .",
    "for this figure , we assumed a cross - section of @xmath165 .",
    "the contribution of the unmasked subhalo population is dominated by outliers in luminosity .",
    "it is therefore not reliable . ]    in our simulation with via lactea ii , the index @xmath152 is approximately @xmath166 .",
    "interestingly , this index can be estimated through basic scaling relations .",
    "the absolute luminosity @xmath167 of a subhalo scales roughly as @xmath168 .",
    "the concentration parameter @xmath53 is given by equation ( [ eq : concentration ] ) and scales as @xmath169 , where @xmath170 is the distance from the galactic centre . because most contributions to the anisotropy originate from subhaloes beyond a distance @xmath171 of @xmath96 from the observer , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : distance ] , we approximate the distance of the subhalo to the observer with the distance to the galactic centre , @xmath172 . in this case , the apparent luminosity @xmath133 of a subhalo is proportional to @xmath173 . finally , the number of subhaloes @xmath174 above some apparent luminosity @xmath133 scales as @xmath175 . here",
    ", we have neglected the decrease of subhalo abundance as a function of @xmath170 .",
    "this would lower the index @xmath152 . also note that in the above calculation , we have not assumed any mass - concentration relation or subhalo mass function .",
    "the index @xmath152 does therefore not strongly depend on extrapolations to lower masses as long as @xmath176 stays constant with mass . with @xmath177 for via lactea ii this reproduces @xmath178",
    ".    would our results be qualitatively different for the aquarius simulation ?",
    "with @xmath179 @xcite this would yield a very similar result , @xmath180 , and the number of subhaloes above @xmath142 would only decrease by @xmath181 per cent and still strongly violate observations of individually detected sources .",
    "additionally , adopting a slope of @xmath182 for the subhalo number density in equation ( [ eq : numberdensity ] ) , as done for aquarius @xcite , would yield a higher contribution from distant , high - mass haloes and lower the index @xmath152 again . to evade the constraints of individually detected sources",
    ", one would need a much higher value of @xmath183 or above .",
    "this could , in principle , be realized by an increasing concentration parameter or number density of subhaloes as a function of the distance from the galactic centre .",
    "but this strongly contradicts previous results from high - resolution simulations @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have predicted the dm annihilation aps from the high - resolution via lactea ii n - body simulation and compared it to recent measurements of the gamma - ray anisotropy .",
    "we have first characterized the effect of different analytical density profiles and cosmic variance .",
    "in contrast to the results in @xcite , we found that different radial distributions only have a mild effect on the aps .",
    "we have then compared our predictions to the results in @xcite and showed that dm can not contribute to the anisotropies of the dgrb without strongly violating observations from identified sources and the spectrum of the dgrb . for completeness",
    ", we show our limits on the dm cross - section , @xmath0 , into @xmath76 in fig .",
    "[ fig : limits ] .",
    "the apparent failure of anisotropies in the dgrb to place competitive constraints on dm annihilation in the milky way is based on a very general argument .",
    "the anisotropy in the dgrb is caused by a large number of astrophysical sources just below the detection threshold , @xmath108 . since the signal - to - noise ratio for these measurements is not very high",
    ", dm would need to have a comparable number of sources , e.g. subhaloes , below the detection threshold to give a detectable anisotropy contribution .",
    "but , unless a very unusual behaviour of the source count distribution @xmath150 for dm subhaloes is invoked , this necessarily implies a large number of sources above the detection threshold .    based on this argument , it seems unlikely that anisotropies can place any competitive constraints in the near future .",
    "while the precision of the anisotropy measurements will increase as _ fermi _ collects more data , so will the detection efficiency .",
    "additionally , the blazar model in @xcite already explains almost all the anisotropies in the dgrb .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that an advancement in the knowledge of the background sources will improve the anisotropy constraints substantially .",
    "however , we want to stress that cross - correlating the anisotropies with gravitational tracers @xcite is a very promising way to probe extragalactic dm annihilation .",
