    "since its early days , the field of ultracold atoms has traditionally been focused on alkali atoms , which feature a strong , closed transition favorable for laser cooling and trapping . in the last ten years , a lot of progress has been made in bringing more complex atoms to quantum degeneracy @xcite .",
    "two - electron atoms , for instance from the alkaline - earth family or ytterbium , have been of particular interest because of one special feature , an ultranarrow @xmath2 optical transition from the @xmath0 ground state to a metastable @xmath1 optically excited state ( here @xmath3 denote the electronic angular momentum for the ground and excited states ) .",
    "although electric dipole - forbidden , the transition can be weakly enabled by hyperfine interactions or an applied magnetic field @xcite . mastering the laser technology required to observe such transitions with a spectroscopic resolution at or below the hertz level enabled the development of optical atomic clocks ( see @xcite for reviews of this field , and @xcite for specific realizations using ytterbium atoms ) . although optical atomic clocks are typically operated using dilute samples far from quantum degeneracy , many - body effects are nevertheless measurable because of the extreme spectroscopic sensitivity @xcite .",
    "a number of proposals have been made to use such  clock \" transitions , virtually free from spontaneous emission , to manipulate quantum - degenerate gases , with diverses purposes ranging from quantum information processing @xcite to the realization of effective magnetic fields @xcite or strongly - interacting impurity models @xcite in optical lattices . in this article",
    ", we report on high - resolution spectroscopy on bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) of ytterbium atoms , a first step towards more complex experiments using the clock transition .",
    "we use here bosonic @xmath4yb and demonstrate how spectroscopic features of the @xmath5 transition , observed with sub - khz resolution , can yield informations about the velocity distribution .",
    "previously , spectroscopy of trapped yb condensates on another ultranarrow @xmath6 transition has been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "this transition is sensitive to magnetic fields . as a result",
    ", the @xmath5 transition is expected to offer a better spectral resolution , at the expense of a much weaker transition strength .",
    "spectroscopy of trapped yb fermi gases in three - dimensional optical lattices was reported in @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : expsetup ] , we describe our experimental setup used to generate the laser light probing the clock transition , including a high - finesse optical cavity used for locking the laser frequency . in section [ sec :",
    "iodine ] , we show how we calibrate the absolute cavity frequency using an auxiliary spectroscopic reference based on molecular iodine @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : tofspectro ] describes spectroscopy on yb becs , where the condensate is first released from the trap to reduce the interaction energy .",

    "narrow - linewidth laser light with wavelength @xmath8  nm is generated by sum - frequency mixing of two infrared lasers in a non - linear crystal @xcite .",
    "the infrared laser sources used in this work are a solid - state laser emitting around 200 mw near 1319  nm and an amplified fiber laser emitting around 500 mw near 1030  nm .",
    "the frequency of both lasers is controlled using a piezo - electric transducer ( pzt ) on the laser cavities .",
    "the two lasers are coupled into an optical waveguide made from periodically - poled lithium niobate .",
    "the output of the waveguide is sent to a first acousto - optical modulator ( aom1 ) , shifting the light frequency by a quantity @xmath9 .",
    "this aom is used to control the laser frequency to ensure it remains resonant with the cavity , and to control its intensity .",
    "the laser is then split among three paths , a first one leading to an ultrastable optical cavity that we use as a stable frequency reference ( see section  [ sec : cavity ] ) , a second one leading to the atoms _ via _ an optical fiber ( see section  [ sec : tofspectro ] ) , and a third one to an iodine spectroscopy cell used to calibrate the absolute frequency of the cavity ( see section  [ sec : sas ] ) . as detailed in figure",
    "[ figure1 ] , aoms are used to control independently the frequencies of the light in each path .",
    "the cavity path includes an additional electro - optical modulator adding frequency sidebands near 1  ghz",
    ". its purpose will be explained in the following .",
    "single - mode , polarization maintaining optical fibers are used to transport the light from the optical bench where it is generated to the cavity and to the main experiment where ytterbium atoms are probed .",
    "we denote by @xmath10 the light frequency after passing through aom1 , by @xmath11 the frequency of the light used to probe the atoms and by @xmath12 the frequency of the light sent to the cavity .",
    "we use an ultrastable fabry - perot optical cavity as frequency reference to stabilize the frequency of the laser used to perform spectroscopy on the clock transition .",
    "this type of cavities have been extensively studied in the past few years , in connection with the recent developments in optical atomic clocks @xcite .",
    "the cavity we use is a commercial model from advanced thin films ( boulder , co ) , with a spherical body made from ultra - low expansion ( ule ) glass and two fused silica mirrors optically contacted to the ule glass .",
    "the cavity is held at two points and placed inside a commercial housing ( stable laser systems , co ) consisting of the cavity holder surrounded by a gold - coated thermal shield , which are placed inside a vacuum chamber .",
    "this isolates the cavity from detrimental pressure and temperature changes .",
    "the temperature of the thermal shield is actively stabilized to a few millikelvins using a peltier element and a servo control . using an additional eom ( not shown in figure  [ figure1 ] ) ,",
    "the laser frequency is locked to the cavity with the pound - drever - hall technique @xcite .",
    "frequency feedback is applied by changing the frequency @xmath9 of aom1 , driven by a frequency synthesizer with fast modulation input and wide modulation range ( agilent technologies model e4400b ) .",
    "an additional feedback path is used to correct for long term drifts by acting on the frequency - control input of the 1319  nm pump laser .",
    "the cavity resonances are labeled by a longitudinal mode index @xmath13 , according to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the cavity free spectral range ( fsr ) , @xmath16  mm is the cavity length and @xmath17 the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "the free spectral range separating two cavity resonances was calibrated using the eom shown in figure  [ figure1 ] , which adds sidebands spaced by @xmath18ghz to the laser spectrum .",
    "we performed a linear scan of the laser frequency and recorded the frequencies for which the first positive sideband ( frequency @xmath19 ) is resonant with cavity mode @xmath20 and the second negative sideband ( frequency @xmath21 ) is resonant with cavity mode @xmath13 . taking the difference between the two measurements leads to the cavity fsr , @xmath22  khz ( this measurement was done for a cavity temperature @xmath23c ) .",
    "the width of each cavity resonance is determined by the cavity finesse , dependent on the transmission of the cavity input coupler and other losses due to optical imperfections , diffraction , etc ... the finesse is conveniently obtained by measuring the cavity ring - down time by switching off the incoming laser and monitoring the decay of the power transmitted through the cavity over time .",
    "this measurement gives an exponential decay with @xmath24 decay time constant @xmath25s . relating this time constant to the cavity finesse @xmath26 using the formula @xmath27",
    ", we find @xmath28 , which is consistent with the specifications of the manufacturer .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > \" , ]      when dealing with ultra - narrow lines , a key experimental issue is to be able to locate the resonance . for @xmath4yb atoms and",
    "the @xmath5 transition ( hereafter denoted `` clock transition '' ) , accurate values of the transition frequency have been measured by optical atomic clocks @xcite .",
    "measuring the laser frequency to the same precision is however difficult , as the absolute cavity frequency is _ a priori _ unknown .",
    "a basic method would be to perform first a coarse measurement of the cavity frequency ( which can be done with a typical precision on the order of hundred mhz using commercial wavemeters ) and then systematically search for the atomic resonance in the interval corresponding to the frequency uncertainty .",
    "needless to say , this is a cumbersome procedure , which would need to be done again each time the cavity resonance varies ( intentionally or due to uncontrolled drifts ) .",
    "a more precise method to calibrate the cavity frequency is clearly desirable . in principle",
    ", this is achievable with modern technology combining frequency combs with stable microwave atomic clocks @xcite .    when this technology is not available , an alternative is to use an atomic or molecular line for frequency reference .",
    "fortunately , in the case of the @xmath5 transition in @xmath4yb , a nearby resonance in molecular iodine has already been identified and characterized with an uncertainty of @xmath292  khz @xcite .",
    "this molecular resonance , located approximately @xmath30ghz to the blue of the ytterbium clock transition , corresponds to one particular hyperfine component of the so - called r(37)16 - 1 line .",
    "this @xmath31 transition ( @xmath32 denotes the total molecular angular momentum ) is essentially unaffected by magnetic fields and leads to narrow lines suitable to perform accurate frequency calibrations . in the following",
    ", we will denote this specific transition ( corresponding to a frequency @xmath33 ) as  iodine transition \" for simplicity .",
    "we also label with  @xmath13 \" the cavity resonance closest to the clock transition , and  @xmath34 \" the one closest to the iodine transition located three fsrs away from the first one .",
    "the scheme to measure the absolute laser frequency is then clear : first , measure @xmath35 , then deduce @xmath36 using the value @xmath33 measured in @xcite and the calibrated value for @xmath37 , and finally deduce the frequency @xmath11 of the laser probing the atoms using the known aom frequencies ( see figure  [ figure2]a ) .      to observe the iodine resonance , we perform saturated absorption ( sa ) spectroscopy on a quartz cell filled with molecular iodine ( lower path in figure [ figure1 ] ) .",
    "we use a modulation transfer spectroscopy scheme : the probe beam at frequency @xmath10 travels unmodulated through the cell , while the counter - propagating pump beam first passes through an additional aom , shifting its frequency by @xmath38 and modulating it for lock - in detection at the same time .",
    "in such a geometry , the saturated absorption resonance is reached when @xmath39 .",
    "the particular line we investigate lies approximately @xmath40ghz away to the red of the @xmath34 cavity resonance ( see figure  [ figure2]b ) .",
    "we use the eom in the cavity path to bridge this frequency gap , tuning its modulation frequency so that the first negative sideband on the cavity path is near the @xmath34 cavity mode and the laser frequency is near the iodine resonance . in this way , we are able to measure both resonances within the same frequency scan .",
    "typical sa and cavity transmission spectra are shown in figure  [ figure2]c when scanning the laser frequency . by fitting the data ( absorption and transmission ) to lorentzians",
    ", we extract the positions of the @xmath34 cavity resonance and of the iodine resonance , which differ by a quantity @xmath41 , the outcome of the measurement .",
    "the standard deviation of 10 identical measurements performed with fixed parameters is below 10 khz .",
    "we have carefully looked for systematic effects that could affect this measurement . we have found no dependence on the power of the probe laser or applied magnetic field , but identified two effects that need to be accounted for in the frequency measurement .",
    "a first effect is instrumental .",
    "the lock - in amplifier used to obtain the saturated absorption signal behaves as a first - order low pass filter with time constant @xmath42s .",
    "this results in a slight shift of the center of the dispersive lock - in signal shown in figure  [ figure2]c from the iodine resonance .",
    "this is included in our analysis , where the expected lorentzian line shape of the resonance is convoluted with the transfer function of the lock - in and fitted to the measured signal to extract the line position and width .",
    "the second correction is due to collisions inside the iodine cell , which leads to line shift and broadening .",
    "we have carefully measured these effects and correct for them when evaluating the molecular resonance ( see appendix [ app : coll ] ) .",
    "using this technique , we were able to quickly find the yb resonance by interrogating a sample of ultracold atoms ( see next section ) .",
    "repeating the measurements allows us to track changes of the cavity resonance frequencies over time , either because of intended changes in the parameters ( _ e.g. _ the temperature of the cavity ) , or because of uncontrolled environmental drifts .",
    "the error in the absolute frequency is larger than the precision of the measurement , and estimated to be a few tens of khz .",
    "when comparing _ a posteriori _ the laser frequency deduced from the measured iodine resonance with respect to the actual one found from the atomic spectra , we observe shifts of @xmath43khz which are stable to a few khz over extended periods of time , but can vary with modifications of the experimental setup .",
    "possible explanations could be errors in determining the collisional correction , or cell contamination @xcite . according to the value given in @xcite , the differential light shift due to the probe laser itself on the clock transition is around @xmath44khz for our experimental parameters , and",
    "therefore can not explain the observed difference between the observed resonance and the one predicted from the cavity calibration .",
    "an important application of the spectroscopic calibration technique described above is the determination of the zero - crossing point of the cavity .",
    "this refers to the change of the resonance frequency with the cavity temperature , @xmath45 , which quantifies the sensitivity to environmental drifts .",
    "we have performed a series of cavity calibrations using iodine spectroscopy after changing the temperature of the cavity and waiting for approximately one day for thermal equilibrium to settle ( this was experimentally verified by monitoring the cavity frequency over time ) .",
    "the result is plotted in figure  [ figure3 ] in terms of @xmath41 , as defined in section  [ sec : sas ] .",
    "we are able to identify a clear maximum near @xmath46c , where the linear thermal expansion coefficient vanishes .",
    "working near this point is clearly desirable to improve the quality of the frequency reference provided by the cavity , as demonstrated in the next section .    ) versus cavity temperature .",
    "the frequency is measured using iodine spectroscopy and reported in terms of the difference from an arbitrarily chosen reference point at @xmath47c .",
    "the maximum corresponds to minimized sensitivity to environmental drifts.,width=313 ]",
    "we now turn to the main goal of this work , namely spectroscopic interrogation of bosonic @xmath4yb atoms on the clock transition .",
    "we work with a bose - einstein condensate created via forced evaporative cooling @xcite in a crossed optical dipole trap .",
    "the trap is formed by two orthogonal beams , a first one at wavelength 1070 nm propagating along the horizontal @xmath48 axis and a second one at 532  nm propagating along @xmath49 .",
    "this results in an approximately harmonic potential seen by the atoms , with frequencies @xmath50s@xmath51 .",

    "the condensate is initially populated with atoms in the electronic ground state .",

    "we have performed spectroscopy of atomic samples held in the crossed dipole trap , and typically observed 10 khz - broad spectra with an asymmetric line shape .",
    "optical interrogation schemes of bose - einstein condensates were previously considered in the context of bose - einstein condensation of atomic hydrogen @xcite and bragg spectroscopy @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "two effects affecting the lineshape and linewidth of the resonance were identified , namely doppler broadening due to residual motion in the trap and mean - field broadening due to different interactions strengths for atoms in different excited states .",
    "additional factors in our case are a differential position - dependent light shift caused by the trap potential @xcite , and the collisional instability of the excited state .",
    "inelastic collisions involving at least one excited atom do not conserve the principal quantum number .",
    "such collisions impart both collisional partners with a kinetic energy much larger than the trap depth and result in net atom losses at a rate @xmath60 and @xmath61 , with @xmath62 ( respectively @xmath63 ) is the ground ( resp .",

    "we note that the determination of @xmath67 from the measured line shift suggested in @xcite works only in absence of inelastic collisions and differential light shifts .",
    "rough estimates suggest that the mean field , potential energy and inelastic losses contribute each a few khz to the line broadening , complicating the interpretation of the spectra and lowering the achievable precision on the line center .",
    "to minimize the role of interactions ( both elastic and inelastic ) , we interrogate the atoms in free space after releasing them from the trap .",
    "we typically switch on the probe beam @xmath69s after releasing the atoms from the trap and leave it on for 3  ms .",
    "we then let the cloud expand freely in time of flight ( t.o.f . ) for @xmath70ms and measure the remaining ground state population using standard absorption imaging .",
    "atoms in the excited state are not detected : successful excitation of the clock transition thus reduces the measured atom number .",

    "we have performed a second series of experiments where the ballistic nature of the condensate expansion is ensured by releasing it in a  waveguide \" instead of free space .",
