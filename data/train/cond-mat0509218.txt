    "lipid bilayers are among the most versatile of nature s biomaterials . as the interface between the cell and its environment , or between organelles and the cytosol ,",
    "they provide regulated transport of substances as small as protons to as large as entire cells .",
    "such a wide range of functional length scales is naturally studied via an equally broad range of methods .",
    "for example ,",
    "at the smallest scale detailed quantum atomistic simulations are necessary to study the transport of ions or water across the membrane interface @xcite , whereas at the opposite end of the length scale spectrum , analytic theory @xcite and dynamically triangulated lattice simulations @xcite have been used to determine the shape behavior of whole vesicles under various conditions of pressure , volume and area , or even under hydrodynamic flow @xcite . between these two extremes",
    "are problems at the so called `` meso - scale '' which include membrane fusion and rupture @xcite , domain formation in multi - component membranes @xcite , the coupling of membrane composition with curvature , or the interaction of membranes with colloidal or viral particles @xcite .",
    "such problems occur at relatively large length and timescales but at the same time require a particle based approach that reproduces the basic bilayer structure of the membrane .",
    "the combination of these two requirements necessitates the use of coarse grained simulation approaches , in which groups of atoms are represented by single particles .",
    "such coarse grained approaches vary in their level of detail from a single bead per lipid @xcite up to quite detailed lipids with on the order of ten beads @xcite .",
    "naturally such a range of levels of coarse graining goes along with a tradeoff between computational efficiency and level of detail . in this respect , the single most important determinant of model speed appears to be the presence or absence of explicit solvent .",
    "unlike the two - dimensional membrane , the solvent is the _ bulk _ phase which fills the entire simulation box , and integrating its degrees of freedom can easily amount to more than 90% of simulation time .",
    "naturally , one must include solvent when its effects are of inherent interest to the physics of the problem .",
    "in many cases however , its task is merely to mediate the hydrophobic attraction between lipid tails , and as such it is secondary to the overall purpose of the simulation .",
    "if one could simulate bilayer membranes without the need for explicit solvent , a vast increase in accessible length and time scales would result , yet despite the long and successful history of solvent free models in polymer physics , this approach has not yet been widely adopted for lipid bilayer simulations .",
    "this is because the membrane case displays one additional complication : unlike polymers , whose structure is at the outset determined by _ chemistry _ , lipids first have to _ physically _ self - assemble into a two - dimensional fluid bilayer .",
    "this aggregation results from a balance between lipid _ entropy _ and the _ energy _ of cohesion . since in the solvent - free case",
    "the latter stems from effective attractions ( for instance between lipid tails ) , a physically meaningful balance will pose restrictions on the interaction potentials . indeed , the collective experience from the past has shown that simple choices ( _ _ e.__@xmath0_g . _  lennard - jones ,",
    "lj ) do not lead to a fluid bilayer phase but only to `` solid '' bilayers at low temperature and low density ( `` gas '' ) phases at high temperature . concluding that simple pair potentials are insufficient , researchers have then turned to the use of density dependent ( multibody ) interactions @xcite , angular dependent potentials @xcite or highly tuned sets of lennard - jones like potentials @xcite to stabilize the fluid bilayer phase without solvent ( see brannigan _ _ et__@xmath0_al . _  for a recent review @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , each of these approaches suffers from one or more significant drawbacks .",
    "for example , the multibody approach introduces complications for interpretation and measurement of thermodynamic quantities , while neither the angular dependent approach nor the use of tuned lj potentials has so far led to bilayers for which unassisted self - assembly has been demonstrated .",
    "in addition to these technical problems , it is also notable that the reported bending stiffnesses are generally outside the experimentally reported range @xcite , being restricted to either relatively low ( @xcite @xmath1 ) or high ( @xcite @xmath2 ) values .",
    "thus , there remains a clear need for an efficient solvent - free bilayer model that does not suffer from such technical drawbacks and is also highly tuneable .",
    "recently , two new solvent free models have appeared which set out to solve these problems .",
    "one has been proposed by brannigan _",
    "_ et__@xmath0_al .",
    "_  @xcite , the other one by us @xcite .",
    "both models display a wide parameter range in which simple pair attractions drive an unassisted self - assembly into a fluid phase , within which the bending stiffness can be easily tuned .",
    "they differ from all previous solvent free models in their use of attractive potentials that extend somewhat further than a simple lj - potential .",
    "these act either between all tail beads @xcite or are restricted to special interface beads between hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail @xcite . as we shall show in sec .",
    "[ sec : pd ] , our experience with broad attractions of various functional forms strongly suggests that it is this feature which ultimately enables a fluid bilayer phase for these strongly coarse grained systems .",
    "although similar in spirit , these two models differ in a number of details .",
    "for instance , brannigan _ _ et__@xmath0_al .",
    "_  opt for a more detailed representation of lipid molecules compared to us , with the intention to capture local features of the bilayer stress profile more accurately , but at a concomitant price in efficiency .",
    "it therefore depends on the physical problem under study , as well as on ones position in the detail _ vs _ efficiency tradeoff , which model is preferable in any given situation .",
    "a judicious choice then requires good knowledge of the physical properties of these models , which have so far been outlined only rather briefly , and the present paper goes toward filling this gap for the model developed by us . in sec .",
    "[ sec : basic ] and [ sec : pd ] we briefly describe our model and discuss its self - assembly properties .",
    "in particular , we support our claim that the long - ranged nature of the attractions are the feature of key importance by showing that the qualitative physical properties are robust against change of the specific functional form of the attraction . in sec .  [",
    "sec : fluid ] a detailed account of the properties of the fluid phase and their variation with attractive width and temperature is given along with a description of the gel - fluid transition . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : stretch ] we study the stretching and rupture of a bilayer sheet and find near perfect agreement with a simple theoretical model developed by farago @xcite and also tolpekina _ _ et__@xmath0_al . _",
    "@xcite as well as with experimental data .",
    "we describe a model surfactant system which is based on the simple idea that the solvent mediated interaction between lipid tails can be represented by an effective attractive potential of sufficiently broad range .",
    "such a potential can meet the two demands of ( _ i _ ) providing enough cohesive energy to drive assembly of a two - dimensional aggregate , while ( _ ii _ ) permitting enough lateral freedom for the lipid constituents to remain in a fluid state",
    ". there are many ways in which one might construct a coarse grained model based around the central principle of such a broad attractive potential .",
    "below , we shall present two alternatives which differ in the exact form of their tail attractions . in showing both of these",
    "we merely seek to demonstrate that it is not the precise functional form that matters but merely the attractive range .",
    "in this paper we present the most coarse grained version of our model , because this is the most useful in terms of length scales obtainable .",
    "nonetheless , it is worth noting that the same principles can trivially be extended to include more detailed lipids with greater numbers of atoms should this be required . of course",
    ", one should always remember that by increasing the number of lipid beads , the ratio of simulation lengths to real lengths becomes less favorable .",
    "the lipids we use are represented by one `` head '' bead followed by two `` tail '' beads .",
    "their size is fixed via a weeks - chandler - andersen potential @xmath3 & r \\le r_{{\\operatorname{c}}}\\\\      0 & r > r_{{\\operatorname{c}}}\\end{array }    \\right .",

    "lipids are straightened by a harmonic spring with rest length @xmath12 between head - bead and second tail - bead @xmath13 which corresponds in lowest order to a harmonic bending potential @xmath14 for the angle @xmath15 between the three beads .",
    "we fixed the bending stiffness at @xmath16 .",
    "the absence of explicit solvent molecules and the hydrophobic effect they would give rise to is compensated by an attractive interaction between all _ tail _ beads .",
    "we compared two alternative potentials that account for this effect ( see insets to figs .",
    "[ fig : cospd ] and [ fig : ljpd ] ) .",
    "the first of these @xmath17 describes an attractive potential with depth @xmath5 which for @xmath18 smoothly tapers to zero . in this case , tuning the decay range @xmath19 proves to be the key to obtaining a fluid bilayer state .",

    "the above model is sufficiently simple to allow implementation with a variety of molecular dynamics ( md ) integration schemes or even monte - carlo . in this work we performed md simulations with a langevin thermostat to obtain the canonical ensemble @xcite ( time step @xmath26 and a friction constant @xmath27 in lennard - jones units , the lj time scale is given by @xmath28 . ] ) .",

    "the meaning of all symbols is the same as for figure ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cospd ] ) ]    in this section we shall map out the conditions under which a tensionless fluid bilayer state is stable .",
    "to do this we identified the fluid phase in two different ways ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : cospd ] and  [ fig : ljpd ] for the following ) . in the first method ,",
    "a box - spanning bilayer was pre - assembled from 1000 lipids , and its equilibration under zero lateral tension was attempted .",
    "this resulted in one of three possible outcomes : a stable fluid bilayer , a gel phase with strongly increased lipid order and much lower diffusion constant , or complete breakup of the system to form a `` gas '' phase .",
    "the transition between gel and liquid occurred over a narrow temperature range and will be explored in more detail in sec .",
    "[ subsec : gelfluid ]",
    ". the gas phase was always identified as the point at which the imposition of zero tension conditions resulted in a divergence in the box length .",
    "lipids in a cubic box of side length @xmath38 .",
    "lipid cohesion was set to @xmath39 ( @xmath24 ) and temperature to @xmath40 . a random gas of lipids quickly forms small clusters which slowly coarsen and eventually `` zip up '' to form a box - spanning bilayer sheet .",
    "the numbers indicate the md time . ]",
    "our second method for identifying the fluid bilayer phase was designed to ensure that we were not artificially stabilizing the bilayer due to pre - assembly . in this case",
    "we conducted constant volume simulations starting from a random `` gas '' configuration . under all conditions which previously gave stable tensionless membranes , a bilayer patch",
    "quickly self - assembled , which , at the correct box size could zip up with its open ends to span the box ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : zip ] for such a sequence ) . if the box was too big , the patch either remained free , or ( sometimes ) closed upon itself to form a vesicle .",
    "for rather large values of the width parameter @xmath19 or @xmath20 the line between fluid bilayer and the isotropic `` gas '' state becomes less distinct .",
    "for example , we observed that for @xmath41 and @xmath42 , self assembly to box spanning bilayers ( at constant volume ) could occur well above the evaporation boundary and that immediately below this boundary we observed rather indistinct bilayers , with particularly high flip - flop rates and low orientational order .",
    "although we will see in sec .",
    "[ sec : cross_bilayer ] that these relatively disordered states still show a definite bilayer structure , we should not be surprised if strange behaviors are found in this small region , and we would therefore caution against the physical interpretation of such results without additional checks for model artifacts .    using the methods mentioned above , we determined the phase diagrams for both types of attractive tail potentials , eqns .",
    "( [ eqn : cos ] ) and ( [ eqn : lj ] ) , shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : cospd ] and [ fig : ljpd ] , respectively .",
    "the most important point to note is that in both cases we see a fluid bilayer region that broadens significantly as potential width is increased . in this sense , both phase diagrams are remarkably similar given the strong differences in the nature of the functional forms and tuning parameters used to obtain them . at a more detailed level , one can see differences in the shape of the transition lines between the two models .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that the two width parameters work entirely differently . in the case of the cosine attraction , eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : cos ] ) , the attractive gradient is actually varied along with @xmath19 , whereas for eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : lj ] ) , varying @xmath20 leaves the attractive shape unchanged and merely adds a region of zero force close to the particle .    based on the relative similarity of our results for two such radically different potentials , our expectation is therefore that other potentials with a broad attractive width should also share the important property of exhibiting a stable fluid bilayer phase .",
    "this finds further support in the observation that the recent model of brannigan _",
    "_ et__@xmath0_al .",
    "_  @xcite also uses a broad @xmath43 attraction .",
    "of course , a direct comparison is difficult because they restrict this attraction to the interface bead between lipid head and tail .",
    "notwithstanding the physical motivation of this choice as being in accord with knowledge of the lateral stress profile , it would be interesting to check whether _ fluidity _ is ultimately insensitive to this detail and rests on the long range alone .    faced with these possibilities , as well as others we might think of for the tail attraction , the question is now which to choose . since our potential attempts to capture the effects of solvent exclusion , lipid - lipid interactions , and the fact that our 3 bead `` lipid '' is a highly coarse grained representation of the real thing , it is difficult to guess what its functional form should look like .",
    "instead we could attempt to differentiate between models on the basis of their emergent physical properties ; however , it turns out that both are highly tuneable over a similar range .",
    "therefore our primary considerations are practical ones . in this regard the cosine attraction , eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : cos ] ) , is preferable since it acts over a slightly shorter range than the broadened lj potential and is therefore faster to compute .",
    "the remainder of this paper will therefore focus on it alone .",

    "we used systems with 4000 lipids at constant zero tension with a lateral box size of @xmath54 .",
    "although such a large system provides good statistics , it also introduces the problem of dealing with undulations .",
    "we solved this by first assigning lipids to a @xmath55 grid in the @xmath56-plane and measuring the height @xmath53 with respect to the average local height for that grid cell .",
    "failure to do so will overestimate the width of the distributions significantly .",
    "calculations of @xmath52 for weakly coarse grained @xcite or fully atomistic lipid bilayers @xcite typically show differences between the shape and width of @xmath52 for each functional group in the lipid . of course , a strongly coarse grained model such as ours can not hope to reproduce such subtleties .",
    "our main concern is rather to ensure that the bilayer is not merely a loose agglomeration of lipids but that these lipids are oriented approximately vertically and that they do not strongly interdigitate ( although such interdigitated phases do occur naturally under certain circumstances @xcite they are not the `` norm '' for a fluid bilayer ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig : zprof ] one can verify that a well defined bilayer structure is indeed present for our system .",
    "each of the three lipid beads shows a sharp peak about its average @xmath53 .",

    "upper and lower head beads are separated by a distance of approximately @xmath57 , while the inflection points of the summed density are separated by about @xmath58 .",
    "this agrees with our expectations for vertically oriented lipids having only minor interdigitation .",
    "further evidence for distinct bilayer leaflets can be seen in the summed bead density which shows a slight peak for each of the terminal tail beads and a minimum at the bilayer midplane .     as a function of vertical distance @xmath53 from the bilayer midplane for a system of 4000 lipids at constant zero tension and with simulation parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",

    "unfortunately , it turns out to be extremely hard to eliminate any remaining tension by adjusting the simulation box size by hand , since the tension depends very sensitively on bilayer area ( see sec .  [",

    "we first note that the trends for all observables are monotonic , showing a consistent change from bilayers close to the liquid - gas boundary to those close to the liquid - gel boundary . starting with the structural parameters , @xmath45 and @xmath61",
    ", we see that both indicate an increase in order with larger potential range @xmath19 .",
    "this is not immediately obvious , because broadening of the attractive potentials could also give the lipids more lateral freedom .",
    "yet , the increase in @xmath45 indicates that lipids fluctuate less around their average vertical position , and this goes hand in hand with a concomitant decrease in the overlap @xmath61 between the vertical density profiles for individual beads .",
    "in fact , it turns out that the average bead positions are roughly constant , hence the main mechanism by which @xmath61 can increase is via the broadening of @xmath52 peaks for individual beads ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : zprof ] ) .",
    "close to the liquid gas boundary the bilayer order is rather low . indeed ,",
    "visual inspection of bilayers with @xmath140 confirms that these are indeed very `` fuzzy '' .",
    "although a clear bilayer structure can still be seen in such cases , we would caution against using these in the attempt to model real lipid systems .",
    "the increase in order becomes more understandable when looking at the average area per lipid . extending the range of the cohesive potential leads to an overall lateral contraction of the bilayer , thus explaining the reduced fluctuations and thus the behavior of @xmath45 and @xmath61 .",
    "it is remarkable that the area per lipid of all four isotherms agrees after rescaling .",
    "this indicates that the lipid density depends purely on the distance from the liquid - gas phase boundary rather than the absolute value of temperature or @xmath19 individually .",
    "the area @xmath131 per lipid can also be used to map the coarse - grained length scale @xmath8 to experimental lengths . for real phospholipid membranes values around @xmath141 for the area per lipid",
    "are typical @xcite , while our simulations give values in the range @xmath142 . assuming that one coarse - grained lipid is equivalent to one real lipid this gives a mapping of roughly @xmath143 .",
    "an alternative mapping can be obtained by comparing a typical bilayer thickness of roughly @xmath144 with the measured width of the overall lipid density of approximately @xmath58 ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : cross_bilayer ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : zprof ] ) , which gives @xmath145 .",
    "such good agreement between these two mappings indicates that our very simple 3 bead lipids are actually remarkably close to the aspect ratio of real lipids .",
    "the observables presented so far reflect mostly local bilayer properties .",
    "in contrast , the bending stiffness is an observable which , even though it ultimately derives from local bilayer properties , yields physics which is accessible by large scale continuum calculations .",
    "much of the theoretical modeling of fluid membranes hinges on the remarkable fact that on sufficiently large length scales they can be described by idealized surfaces with a very simple energy density , for which the bending stiffness @xmath71 is in almost all cases the only relevant modulus @xcite .",
    "reproducing experimentally meaningful and easily tuneable values for this modulus is therefore one of the key requirements for any coarse - grained membrane modeling that aims at bridging the gap between local and global scales .    using the procedure described in sec .",
    "[ sec : bending_modulus ] we calculated @xmath71 for each of the four isotherms @xmath146 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 and for all values of @xmath19 in the fluid phase .",
    "the two most important conclusions from these data are the following : first , the range of accessible values for the bending stiffness coincides exactly with the experimentally interesting range for usual phospholipids @xcite .",
    "second , the value of @xmath71 can be easily tuned via one parameter , the potential range @xmath19 . beyond that , it is quite remarkable that plotting @xmath147 against the rescaled potential width @xmath148 collapses all data points onto one master curve  with the notable exception of @xmath149 , which also stands out for the diffusion constant ( see below ) . as a guide to the eye",
    ", a single line is shown for the three warmest isotherms and a separate line for the coldest one .",
    "just as for the area per lipid it seems thus that the bending modulus depends only on the distance from the liquid - gas boundary .",
    "this is plausible , since the bending modulus is inversely proportional to the lateral compressibility , which again depends on the lipid density .    .",

    "[ fig : diffcombo ] ) and the flip - flop - rate @xmath152 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rcombo ] ) show a clear exponential decay with increasing @xmath153 . since we know that for free diffusion @xmath154 , a simple rescaling by temperature brings the diffusion constants for all isotherms into rough agreement , with the notable exception of @xmath149 .",
    "we have seen that this same isotherm also gives an anomalous trend in the bilayer stiffness , and one can speculate that this may be due to the unusual shape of the phase diagram ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cospd ] ) between @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "a typical value for the diffusion constant of lipids in real phospholipid membranes is about @xmath157 @xcite . taking an average value of about @xmath158 from our data , and using the length mapping @xmath159 ( see above ) we obtain a time scale mapping of @xmath160 .",
    "although we do not place great quantitative weight on such an approximate calculation , it does serve to illustrate that the timescales accessible by us are extremely long , being of the order of milliseconds .",
    "this is long enough , for example , to allow vesicles to self assemble or fuse , and for macroscopic phase separation to take place .    in the case of flip - flop rates we found a strong dependence on temperature which is in accordance with the fact that this is a thermally activated process .",
    "the most important point to note however is that the range of actual values for @xmath152 obtained by us are many orders of magnitude faster than those typically found for artificial phospholipid bilayers in experiments @xcite .",
    "such a large discrepancy is not as alarming as it may at first seem since the rate @xmath152 is exponentially dependent on the activation energy for flip @xmath161 ( arrhenius law ) .",
    "we can therefore account for a very large difference in @xmath152 by a relatively small discrepancy in @xmath161 .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that the lipids in our model undergo flip - flop too easily compared with real lipids .",
    "if one were specifically interested in this aspect of the dynamics , this would clearly represent a problem , however in many other cases it provides an advantage because the system will approach equilibrium more rapidly .",
    "if an accurate flip - flop rate is important we anticipate that our model lipids could be made to flip much less readily simply by increasing the chain length slightly ( eg 4 bead lipids ) and imposing a much stronger head - tail repulsion .       across the gel - fluid phase boundary .",
    "each figure shows a cooling - heating hysteresis for a particular value of @xmath19 . from top",
    "to bottom the values of @xmath162 used were @xmath134 , @xmath163 , and @xmath164 .",
    "arrows indicate the direction of temperature change .",
    "the rate of temperature change was @xmath165 for the top plot and @xmath166 for the bottom two plots .",
    "the three vertical lines in the uppermost plot indicate the temperatures where the order parameter of fig .",
    "[ fig : lh ] has been measured . ]    at constant values of @xmath19 one can vary the temperature to observe both liquid - gel and liquid - gas transitions . since we studied lipid phase behavior at vanishing lateral tension ,",
    "the liquid - gas boundary is necessarily sharp in our case .",
    "however , it is worth mentioning that under constant volume conditions alternative low density phases such as spherical or cylindrical micelles can be observed . using the present model we have in fact observed such micellar phases , and together with one more control parameter",
    " overall lipid density  their phase behavior could be studied as well .",
    "this , however , is not the purpose of our present work and will be presented elsewhere . here",
    "we concentrate on the transition between liquid and gel phases at vanishing lateral tension .",
    "there are several different ordered phases which collectively can be referred to as gels @xcite , but we shall not attempt to identify all of these .",
    "indeed , our rather simple three bead model was neither designed to reproduce such subtleties of lipid ordering nor would we actually expect to observe the full zoo of ordered bilayer phases .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : glboxl ] we show the variation of lipid area @xmath131 with temperature for three values of @xmath19 . in all cases we chose to employ continuous temperature scans in order to allow the barostat to smoothly follow the substantial changes in box size involved . the important question",
    "then arises : `` is our rate of cooling slow enough ? '' .",
    "we checked this by comparing plots of @xmath131 _ vs _",
    "@xmath167 for runs with four different cooling rates @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 , and @xmath171 ( in units of @xmath172 ) , from which one can see a clear deviation for the fastest rate but qualitatively very similar results for all slower ones .",
    "the only difference is that slightly sharper transition boundaries can be seen as the rate is lowered , even among the slowest three rates . as a compromise between speed and resolution we chose the intermediate rate @xmath173 for runs with @xmath39 and @xmath174 which display only a single transition . for runs with @xmath175 , where two transitions must be resolved , we chose the slower rate , @xmath176 .    before focusing on the results at each value of @xmath19 it is interesting to note that all runs show quite a strong hysteresis across the transition boundary as is typical of first order transitions .",
    "however , there is also a long tail to the hysteresis which appears during cooling .",
    "this is most likely due to the fact that the kinetics during gelling is strongly determined by the slow healing of defects .",
    "indeed , we often observed such defects , many of which could be seen to dissappear during further slow cooling .     of the height difference @xmath53 between a lipid and its @xmath177 immediate neighbours .",
    "solid , dashed , and dotted curves correspond to the temperatures indicated by lines 1 , 2 , and 3 in fig .",
    "[ fig : glboxl ] , respectively . ]    turning now to the results at @xmath178 we find that there are _ two _ clear and sudden transitions during cooling as well as the reverse for heating . during cooling ,",
    "both transitions involve a contraction of the area @xmath131 and an increase in the orientational order @xmath45 ( not shown ) ; however , if we look at the diffusion constant @xmath93 we find that it decreases suddenly from about @xmath179 to approximately @xmath180 in the first ( higher temperature ) transition but does not decrease further during the second ( lower temperature ) transition .",
    "in fact , the very small value of the diffusion constant is numerically hard to determine accurately , but the overall drop by about two orders of magnitude is probably robust and corresponds well to what is known for typical phospholipid bilayers @xcite .",
    "thus we have a first transition from fluid to gel and a second transition at a lower temperature to a different gel phase . in order to understand",
    "what is actually occurring in the gel - gel transition we require a suitable order parameter , and it turns out that local lipid packing is what one has to look at .",
    "we calculated a histogram of height differences @xmath181 between a lipid head and that of its six nearest neighbors .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lh ] for bilayers at temperatures @xmath182 , @xmath183 , and @xmath184 corresponding to each of the three phases . both the fluid phase and the high temperature gel phase",
    "show a distribution peaked about @xmath185 ; however , there is a striking change as we go to the phase at @xmath182 which shows three peaks at @xmath186 and @xmath139 .",
    "this shows that the lipids are now packed in an off - centered manner rather like oranges in a crate .",
    "puzzlingly , however , an equal proportion of lipids are found at @xmath187 which would not occur if a perfect packing was obtained .",
    "this might be due to the presence of a still large number of defects .    at larger values of @xmath19",
    "there is just a single transition from the fluid to the gel phase .",
    "this gel phase is packed similarly to the low temperature gel phase for @xmath178 since it also exhibits a three peak structure in the histogram of @xmath181 .",
    "finally , the plots of area per lipid _ vs _ temperature also contain information besides the evident phase transitions .",
    "their _ slope _ yields the value of the lateral thermal area expansivity , defined by @xmath188 for instance , the system with @xmath108 has a slope @xmath189 in the fluid phase and an area per lipid of @xmath190 at @xmath191 .",
    "identifying this temperature with room temperature , we obtain a thermal expansivity of @xmath192 , which coincides remarkably well with the value measured by kwok and evans for fluid lecithin bilayers ( @xmath193 ) @xcite .",
    "so far we have studied membranes under zero lateral tension .",
    "if we now apply extensional stress , the area per lipid will increase , up to the point where structural stability of the bilayer is breached . beyond a critical stress",
    "a pore can be nucleated , which then grows indefinitely , _ _ i.__@xmath0_e .",
    "_ , the bilayer ruptures .",
    "this scenario has been described theoretically by litster @xcite .",
    "important bilayer properties ( _ _ e.__@xmath0_g . _  the line tension of an open edge ) could be extracted from observables such as the critical stress or the critical pore size , but it is evidently experimentally very difficult to study membranes at the brink of rupture . however , in a simulation it is very easy to perform measurements in a different ensemble , namely one of constant _ area _ of the entire bilayer . beyond some critical strain one",
    "would now expect a pore to open , but since this now relieves much of the stress , pore growth stops and one obtains a _",

    "this was done by placing 4000 lipids in a bilayer configuration spanning the @xmath56-plane of the simulation box . after allowing for an equilibration time of @xmath197 we",
    "then simulated for a further @xmath197 , during which time the lateral tension @xmath198 was measured .",
    "the resulting plot of @xmath199 _ vs _ @xmath72 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tension ] .",
    "three main regimes are clearly distinguishable , separated by two values of the bilayer area .",
    "first , at a particular area @xmath200 the tension vanishes .",
    "boxes with a smaller area yield a negative tension , _ _ i.__@xmath0_e . _ , a positive pressure .",
    "the bilayer is under compressional strain , which it evades very soon by _",
    "buckling_. conversely , boxes with an area larger than @xmath200 subject the bilayer to extensional strain and create a proportional increase in tension . at some particular value for the bilayer area",
    "the energy stored in the extension , which grows quadratically with the strain , must exceed that of a bilayer with a pore , since the pore size can not grow faster than the strain , and the line tension is proportional to the square root of pore size .",
    "once the pore opens it releases much of the stress and further expansion of the area remarkably leads to further _ decrease _ in the stress .",
    "this `` wrong '' sign for the extensibility explains why a stable pore can not be achieved under constant tension conditions .    the model of farago @xcite and tolpekina _",
    "_ et__@xmath0_al .",
    "_  gives perfect agreement with the measured data , stretching modulus @xmath201 , and line tension @xmath202 ( see appendix b ) .",
    "these can be obtained purely from the initial stretching regime and the point of rupture .",
    "notably , the subsequent drop in tension and the shape of the curve after pore opening are then completely determined and not subject to further fitting . ]",
    "( see lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : tension ] ) .",
    "this , however , not only shows that their theoretical assumptions were correct but also provides a reference for comparison of our model with the well known model of goetz and lipowsky @xcite since tolpekina _ _ et__@xmath0_al .",
    "_  fitted their results to this earlier model .",
    "contrary to ours , the model of goetz and lipowsky includes explicit solvent . that both simulations can be described very well by the same theory implies that their physical behavior under extensional stress is indeed very similar .",
    "fitting the linear extensional regime of our simulational data to the stretching model we obtain a modulus of @xmath203 .",
    "translating this to real values depends again on the mapping .",

    "both these values are very reasonable @xcite , but one has to be careful , since they depend in a nontrivial way on system size @xcite .",
    "we have presented a model for the solvent free simulation of coarse grained lipid bilayer membranes that is free of the major problems encountered by earlier efforts towards this goal .",
    "it robustly self - assembles to a fluid phase , uses simple two body potentials , and is highly tuneable .",
    "we have emphasized that we regard its functioning to rely on a general principle : the presence of sufficiently broad tail attraction potentials .",
    "this gives lipids a chance of lateral mobility while maintaining fluidity .",
    "since rearrangements and their concomitant local increase in pair distances do not immediately cost most of the binding energy , the entropy gain upon fluidization is not inhibited energetically . in this context",
    "we remind the reader that it is a well known fact from colloidal physics that if the range of attraction is too short compared to the particle s hard core radius , no more fluid phase exists @xcite .",
    "this principle should therefore also help if extensions to our present model , such as more beads per lipid or a restriction of the long - ranged attraction to specific beads only are to be employed .",
    "we have measured many physical characteristics of our membrane model and have illustrated that they are easily tuneable in a controlled way .",
    "often their values fall well inside or close to the experimentally interesting range without any explicit careful tuning .",
    "this indicates that the model is clearly flexible enough and can serve as a good starting point for quantitative matching to specific systems in the spirit of systematic coarse graining , which is an approach that has only recently been employed for lipid membrane simulations @xcite but is well established in other fields of soft matter @xcite . since we have demonstrated that we can readily achieve mesoscopic length scales beyond @xmath211 and time scales of milliseconds , this opens up a wide range of interesting mesoscale problems that can with some additional parameter matching be simulated quantitatively .",
    "efforts in this direction are currently under way .",

    "in sec .  [ sec : bending_modulus ] we determined the bending modulus from the membrane fluctuation spectrum , which in turn was extracted from the simulation by interpolating the lipid positions onto a @xmath89 grid . however , any method which interpolates continuous variables onto grid points is prone to discretization artifacts , and it is crucial to identify them in advance .",
    "we illustrate the difficulty in the one - dimensional case first .",

    "grid interpolation was achieved by assigning to any grid point the average of the @xmath212 for the @xmath31-values closest to that grid point .",
    "if there are many such points , this basically means that we do not sample the mode at the grid point , but rather sample its _ average _ around that grid point .",
    "let us thus define the average - sampled interpolation function @xmath226 via @xmath227 where we introduced @xmath228 .",
    "evidently @xmath226 differs from the ordinary sampled interpolation function @xmath229 by an additional wave - vector dependent but position independent prefactor .",
    "this factor goes to zero at @xmath230 , which implies that such modes are entirely averaged away , but already at the boundary of the brillouin zone , at @xmath231 , it has the disconcertingly small value @xmath232 .",
    "once the mode has arrived on the mesh , it s amplitude is no longer what it used to be off - lattice .",
    "the inverse finite fourier transform of @xmath226 is also multiplied by this prefactor : @xmath233 and thus the power spectrum is damped according to @xmath234 at the boundary of the brillouin zone this factor is @xmath235 and thus not at all negligible . notice that this does not depend on the mode amplitude .",
    "in other words , even if the mode is only slightly excited and the membrane thus looks benignly flat , the estimate for the power spectrum derived from the gridded function is systematically too low .",
    "it is easy to see that in two dimensions this result generalizes to @xmath236    the fact that this damping is @xmath237-dependent renders it potentially harmful . fig .",

    "for the total energy of an elastic bilayer spanned inside a frame of area @xmath199 which displays a harmonic extensibility with modulus @xmath201 and which has a line tension @xmath202 , @xcite write @xmath238 where @xmath200 is the tensionless area of that bilayer and @xmath239 the radius of a circular pore . if @xmath239 is indeed nonzero , its value has to be chosen such as to minimize @xmath240 .",
