    "quantum walks ( qws ) @xcite are the quantum analogue of classical random walks ( rws ) @xcite , and one of the main building blocks for quantum algorithms @xcite .",
    "an important example , which demonstrates the impressive potential of quantum computing , is given by quantum search algorithms @xcite .",
    "while the lower bound on the time complexity of classical search algorithms on unsorted databases is linear in size , quantum search algorithms often have , depending on the structure of the database , time complexity sublinear in size .",
    "another example for the improvement of classical algorithms is the element distinctness problem @xcite .",
    "the development of quantum pagerank algorithms @xcite and the simulation of neutrino oscillations @xcite provide further examples for the wide range of applications of qws .    for both rws and qws , there are discrete - time and continuous - time formulations . for rws ,",
    "the relation between these two formulations is very close , both formally and with regards to the behavior over time .",
    "in fact , the transition matrix of a continuous - time rw is obtained from the discrete - time transition matrix either via limits or by using a poisson process to transfer the time variable into a continuous domain be a poisson random variable and denote the expected value by @xmath0 . for the continuous - time transition matrix @xmath1 and the discrete - time transition matrix @xmath2 of the rw , we have @xmath3 .\\ ] ] ] .",
    "the relation between discrete - time qws ( dtqws ) and continuous - time qws ( ctqws ) is less straightforward .",
    "the dimension of the hilbert space in which a ctqw  @xcite takes place is equal to the number of vertices of the underlying graph . a first stepping stone for linking dtqws and ctqws comes from the need for additional degrees of freedom in the discrete - time model , which is indirectly stated by the no - go lemma @xcite .",
    "for instance , the dtqw models in refs .",
    "@xcite introduce those extra degrees of freedom via `` quantum coins '' .",
    "more precisely , the no - go lemma states that on @xmath4-dimensional lattices , there exist no nontrivial , homogeneous , scalar unitary cellular automata .",
    "for example , one can generate nontrivial but inhomogeneous evolution by alternating the action of local operators .",
    "the staggered qw model  @xcite is an example of this class , and it has no internal space . if the evolution is driven by the application of two local operators , say @xmath5 and @xmath6 , then setting @xmath7 would restore homogeneity but break locality by allowing the walker to take two steps per time unit .",
    "however , in the context of qws _ on graphs _ , it seems preferable to respect locality . in coined models , there are two evolution operators involved as well , but they can be combined without violating locality since the coin space is not considered to be spatial .    it is known that dtqws and ctqws have the same or similar features , such as the same spreading rate on lattices , similar probability distributions , and almost the same asymptotic behavior for large time .",
    "connections between dtqws and ctqws have been established through reduction of the dtqw s larger state space by taking appropriate limits @xcite .",
    "strauch  @xcite analyzed the connection between coined and continuous - time qws on the line by describing a method to convert the evolution equations of the coined model into the evolution equations of the ctqw model when the length of the time steps tends to zero .",
    "dalessandro  @xcite extended strauch s results by first obtaining the dynamics of ctqws on @xmath4-dimensional lattices as an appropriate limit of the dynamics of the coined model on the same lattices , and by then extending those results to regular graphs .",
    "childs  @xcite used the szegedy qw model  @xcite to propose a coined model whose behavior approaches that of a related ctqw in a certain limit .",
    "molfetta and debbasch  @xcite analyzed the same kind of connection in the case when both time and length steps tend to zero .",
    "for dtqws on @xmath4-regular graphs with coins that are both unitary and hermitian , dheeraj and brun  @xcite presented constructions of families of dtqws that have well defined continuous - time limits on larger graphs . in this work ,",
    "we go in the opposite direction ; instead of obtaining ctqws as limits of dtqws , we produce the evolution of the coined discrete - time model on a generic graph using a ctqw method .",
    "percolation graphs and statistical networks introduce decoherence into qws , causing a shift towards classical behavior .",
    "this was noted for the first time by romanelli et al .",
    "@xcite for coined qws on the line .",
    "it was generalized to 2-dimensional lattices in ref .",
    "@xcite and analyzed further in ref .",
    "continuous - time qws on percolation graphs were addressed in many papers , such as refs .",
    "@xcite . in the usual percolation model ,",
    "the graph changes dynamically as edges break randomly or are inserted randomly .",
    "the `` percolation '' that is used in our construction is different in that it is systematic rather than random , and it so creates a graph alternation that allows to define ctqws that are equivalent to given coined qws .",
    "our work borrows some ideas from the staggered model @xcite , which can be considered an intermediate step for our constructions and which was also used in ref .",
    "@xcite to connect szegedy s model with coined qws .",
    "it is not necessary to be familiar with the staggered model though , as the paper at hand is entirely self - contained .    in this work",
    "we will , starting from the coined model on a generic graph , define a ctqw on a larger graph , which we call the expanded graph , that exactly reproduces the evolution of the original coined qw .",
    "instances of this expanded graph have already appeared in ref .",
    "@xcite , which has similarities to our work but a different objective .",
    "we consider flip - flop coined qws on undirected graphs .",
    "this type of dtqw acts on hilbert spaces of dimension @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the number of edges . since the dimension of the hilbert space in which a ctqw takes place is equal to the size of the graph",
    ", the number of nodes of the expanded graph has to be @xmath8 .",
    "the most simple case is when the graph is regular and when only grover coins are used , and then we will obtain correspondence of the coined qw to continuous - time evolution of the form @xmath10 , where the hamiltonian @xmath11 is the graph laplacian and the underlying graph changes dynamically between two percolations of the expanded graph",
    ". it would be desirable to avoid the use of percolation ; however , since our constructions are exact , they thereby provide insights into the limitations for attempts to reconcile the coined and continuous - time models .",
    "we hence consider our work a new starting point for further studies of that relation .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "first we review ctqws and combine them with percolation @xcite ( sec .",
    "[ sec : ctqw ] ) .",
    "we then review flip - flop coined qws ( sec .",
    "[ sec : dtqw ] ) , a commonly used type of dtqws , and take first steps to translate their building blocks into the continuous - time setting ( sec .",
    "[ sec : ops_on_cliques ] ) .",
    "after that , we present our construction of simulations of flip - flop coined qws by means of ctqws on larger , percolated graphs ( sec .",
    "[ sec : construction ] ) .",
    "we then carry out that construction for a simple example ( sec .",
    "[ sec : example ] ) and conclude our work ( sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] ) .",
    "we first briefly review the notion of a continuous - time quantum walk ( ctqw ) on an undirected graph @xmath12 .",
    "the state space @xmath13 for a ctqw on @xmath14 has dimension @xmath15 , and we use the set of vertices @xmath16 as the computational basis , @xmath17 a particle in the graph is described by a state @xmath18 , and the quantity @xmath19 is the probability that it is found at vertex @xmath20 .",
    "a _ continuous - time quantum walk _ is the time evolution an initial state @xmath21 undergoes through the action of a propagator @xmath22 , that is @xmath23 where @xmath11 is a hermitian operator on @xmath13 .",
    "the operator @xmath11 is the hamiltonian of the system and in the context of ctqws on graphs , the _ graph laplacian _",
    "@xmath24 is a common choice for it . here , @xmath25 is the adjacency matrix of the graph and the degree matrix @xmath26 is diagonal with entries @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the @xmath29-th entry of @xmath25 .",
    "we also apply this definition to weighted graphs ; the degree of a vertex is the sum of the weights of all incident edges .",
    "all graphs in this paper are assumed to be free of loops , i.e. the diagonal entries of the adjacency matrix are assumed to be zero . while loops have no effect on the graph laplacian , their presence would unnecessarily complicate some of our later constructions .",
    "we now introduce _ percolation _ into the ctqw model .",
    "in percolation theory , which is , for example , used to study the flow of liquids in porous media , edges in a graph are randomly broken or inserted with some fixed probability . in order to establish the connection between coined and continuous - time qw models , we need to be able to switch on and off edges as well . however , we will be doing so in a very systematic way , which does not generate decoherence .    as an example for percolation , consider a line segment @xmath30 with @xmath31 vertices , where edge @xmath32 has weight @xmath33 and edge @xmath34 has weight @xmath35 .",
    "the below expression shows how the graph laplacian is built , and how it changes when the edge with weight @xmath35 is switched off .",
    "in particular , the percolation affects not only the two entries of @xmath36 that correspond to the edge that is being broken or inserted , but it also adjusts the diagonal entries of the involved vertices , i.e. their degrees , accordingly : @xmath37 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix * } \\quad \\leadsto   l_{\\text{g}}=\\begin{bmatrix*}[r ] 1 & -1 & 0\\phantom{- } \\\\ -1 & 3 & -2\\phantom{- } \\\\ 0 & -2 & 2\\phantom{- } \\end{bmatrix * } \\quad \\leadsto   l_{\\text{g}}'=\\begin{bmatrix*}[r ] 1 & -1 & 0\\phantom{- } \\\\ -1 & 1 & 0\\phantom{- } \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\phantom{-}0\\phantom{- } \\end{bmatrix * }   .\\ ] ]    in the ctqw we will derive later , the hamiltonian is either the graph laplacian or a simple derivation thereof . during the continuous - time evolution",
    "we will then switch on and off certain edges of the graph .",
    "this allows to accommodate the alternation of coin steps and shift steps in the discrete - time model with _",
    "one _ hamiltonian in the continuous - time model , that changes only implicitly via percolation of the underlying graph .",
    "we conclude our discussion of the continuous - time setting by making the following observation on graph laplacians of percolated graphs . if we derive the graphs @xmath38 and @xmath39 from @xmath12 through percolation such that @xmath40 , then @xmath41",
    "we now describe flip - flop coined qws on undirected graphs @xmath12 , where @xmath16 is the set of vertices and @xmath42 is the set of edges .",
    "let the vertices be labeled by @xmath43 and the edges by @xmath44 .",
    "use @xmath45 to denote a generic vertex and @xmath46 for a generic edge .",
    "we define the set of vertex - edge pairs @xmath47 and further the subsets @xmath48 of @xmath49 .",
    "we have @xmath50 for all @xmath46 , and @xmath51 is equal to the degree of the vertex @xmath45 .    for a flip - flop coined qw on @xmath14 , we consider the @xmath52-dimensional hilbert space @xmath13 that is spanned by the states @xmath53 for notational simplicity , we denote the span of this set again by @xmath49 ( i.e. @xmath54 ) and we define the subspaces @xmath55 and @xmath56 accordingly . for @xmath49 itself as well as for the subspaces @xmath55 and @xmath56 , we always use or subsets thereof as the computational basis . the _ flip - flop coined quantum walk _ is driven by the operator @xmath57 where the coin @xmath58 is a direct sum of unitary operators acting on the spaces @xmath56 . an additional restriction on the form of @xmath58 , that is specific to the notes at hand ,",
    "is stated in the next section , cf .  .",
    "the shift @xmath59 is defined by @xmath60 where @xmath61 . note that @xmath59 is a direct sum or @xmath59 , one first has to decide how to list the basis elements @xmath62 .",
    "arranging them with respect to @xmath45 yields a matrix representation of @xmath58 that is in block diagonal form .",
    "the representation of @xmath59 can be made block diagonal by ordering in the @xmath46-component .",
    "] of operators acting on the spaces @xmath55 , and that @xmath63 .",
    "the flip - flop coined qw takes its name from definition  , which states that , during a shift step , a quantum walker standing at vertex @xmath45 and facing edge @xmath46 walks along this edge and then turns around to again face edge @xmath46 .",
    "the fact that this definition does not depend on the structure of the graph or on the labeling of its vertices and edges is a strong argument for the significance of flip - flop coined qws .    restricting our attention to one of the subspaces @xmath55 , we find that the matrix representation of @xmath59 is rather simple : @xmath64 letting @xmath65 be the normalized uniform distribution on the @xmath35-dimensional space @xmath55 , we can also write @xmath66      the additional requirement for @xmath58 is that all its components are of a form similar to , namely @xmath67 where @xmath68 is an orthonormal set in @xmath56",
    ". such coins are , in addition to being unitary , hermitian , and we have @xmath69 , which is why they are called reflections .",
    "however , we first present our construction for coins of the form @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a normalized state of @xmath56 , and we will then outline the case   at the end of our analysis ( in sec  [ sec : general_coins ] , which also provides an overview of the coins covered in this work ) . note that choosing @xmath72 gives the grover coin .",
    "we allow the set @xmath68 in   to be empty . in this case",
    "we get @xmath73 , which we call the search coin .",
    "we now present a visualization of the set of basis elements   of @xmath49 that preserves the global structure of the graph @xmath14 . consider a vertex @xmath45 of degree @xmath4 with incident edges @xmath74 .",
    "we replace @xmath45 by a clique of size @xmath4 and label its vertices @xmath75 .",
    "each vertex @xmath76 is connected to exactly one other clique , namely the one that replaced the vertex the original edge @xmath77 lead to .",
    "let us call this larger graph @xmath78 , the",
    "_ expanded graph_. figure  [ fig : graphs_expansion ] illustrates the expansion @xmath79 and also the subsets of vertices that span the subspaces @xmath55 and @xmath56 , which will be of great importance in later constructions .",
    "note that the hilbert space for a ctqw on @xmath78 has the same dimension as @xmath49 , the hilbert space for a coined qw on @xmath14 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      recall that the components of the shift operator @xmath59 act on 2-cliques and are given by @xmath80 , cf .  .",
    "by  , the corresponding continuous - time hamiltonian @xmath81 that produces the same evolution over a time interval of length @xmath82 is the graph laplacian of that 2-clique .",
    "the direct sum of these operators @xmath81 on the different components @xmath55 is the graph laplacian on @xmath83 .",
    "now , if grover coins are used at all vertices of @xmath14 , then we have @xmath84 for all @xmath45 and consequently continuous - time evolution with respect to the graph laplacian in all components of @xmath85 as well .",
    "this leads to the following observation .",
    "if the graph @xmath14 is @xmath4-regular and if grover coins are used at all vertices , then the evolution for one time step in the flip - flop coined qw on @xmath14 with propagator @xmath86 is reproduced by the following percolated ctqw on the expanded graph @xmath78 :    1 .",
    "evolve the system with respect to the graph laplacian on @xmath85 for time @xmath87 , and then 2 .",
    "evolve with respect to the graph laplacian on @xmath83 for time @xmath88 .",
    "that is , the hamiltonian of the system is the graph laplacian of @xmath78 ; it changes only implicitly due to percolation of @xmath78 at times @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , etc . , and it so takes the two forms needed for the coin step  ( a ) and the shift step  ( b ) .",
    "hence we have established a correspondence to propagation of the form @xmath10 with _ one _",
    "hamiltonian @xmath11 , i.e. , to a ctqw .",
    "steps ( a ) and ( b ) correspond to the lines 79 and 1012 , respectively , of the algorithm in sec .",
    "[ sec : example ] ( with a small modification in the evolution time for ( a ) ) .",
    "if the graph @xmath14 is not @xmath4-regular , we simply weight the components of the graph laplacian @xmath36 of @xmath93 . to be more precise ,",
    "let @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the degree of the vertex @xmath45 , i.e. the dimension of @xmath56 . using the operator @xmath96 as the hamiltonian on the graph @xmath78",
    ", we now obtain equivalence of the two types of qws as above , but with percolations after every @xmath88 time units ( cf .   and recall that @xmath97 ) .",
    "we now consider the situation when coins of the form   with @xmath98 are used .",
    "there are normalized states @xmath99 such that @xmath100 let @xmath101 be a collection of unitary transformations such that @xmath102 maps the uniform distribution @xmath103 of size @xmath51 to @xmath104 . defining the operator @xmath105 allows to carry out the transformations   in all subspaces @xmath56 simultaneously .",
    "hence we obtain the above correspondence between the flip - flop coined qw on @xmath14 and the ctqw on @xmath78 after transforming the operator @xmath106 in   with @xmath107 , that is @xmath108    if marked vertices , at which search coins @xmath109 are used , are present , then we replace the corresponding components of @xmath106 in   by @xmath110 ( cf .   with @xmath111 ) .",
    "we now briefly sketch the construction of the continuous - time hamiltonian for coins of the form @xmath112 here the vertex @xmath45 of the original graph is fixed , @xmath68 is an orthonormal set in @xmath56 , and @xmath113 is less than or equal to the degree @xmath4 of @xmath45 . define the transformation @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the standard basis of @xmath56 ( i.e. a subset of  ) and the @xmath116 are arbitrary states that extend @xmath68 to an orthonormal basis of @xmath56 .",
    "then we have @xmath117 for which @xmath118 is easily solved , cf .  .",
    "applying @xmath119 from the left and @xmath120 from the right then yields a hamiltonian whose propagator over the time interval @xmath121 agrees with the discrete - time coin step @xmath122 .",
    "we conclude the theoretical part of these notes by summarizing the scope of our work . for a flip - flop coined qw on a graph @xmath14 that uses only coins of the form  , we have produced an equivalent ctqw on a larger , dynamically percolated graph . the graph @xmath14 need not be regular , and coins can differ between different vertices .",
    "for example , our theory covers search coins @xmath123 ( @xmath124 , where @xmath113 is the number of terms in the sum  ) , grover coins @xmath125 ( @xmath126 , @xmath72 ) , the @xmath35-dimensional hadamard coin @xmath127 ( @xmath128 , @xmath126 , @xmath129 ) , and the @xmath130-dimensional hadamard coin @xmath131 ( @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 ) .",

    "<S> in addition to expanding the underlying structure , we also have to switch on and off edges during the continuous - time evolution to accommodate the alternation between the shift and coin operators from the coined model . </S>",
    "<S> in one particular case , the connection is very natural , and the continuous - time quantum walk that simulates the coined quantum walk is driven by the graph laplacian on the dynamically changing expanded graph . </S>"
