    "proper motion observations ( eckert & genzel 1997 , ghez et al 1998 ) have revealed in exquisite detail the motions of stars around the black hole in the center of the galaxy .",
    "the closest known stars have extremely eccentric orbits ( for example s2 has an eccentricity of 0.87 ) , pericenters of only a few hundred au , and orbital periods in the range 15  300  yr ( schdel et al 2003 , eisenhauer et al 2005 ) .",
    "these `` s  stars '' are all rather blue ( @xmath0  k. these properties lead to the `` birth problem '' ( ghez et al 2003 ) . the s  stars orbit in a region where tidal forces from the central supermassive black hole prevent star formation _ in situ _",
    ", although several authors have examined whether they were produced after a collision of dense molecular clouds or in an agn  like disc ( e.g. genzel et al .",
    "2003 ; levin & beloborodov 2003 ; miloavljevi & loeb 2004 ) .",
    "a plausible alternative picture is that the s  stars result from the sinking of massive stellar clusters towards the black hole by dynamical friction .",
    "however tides disrupt such clusters at distances @xmath1 1 pc from the black hole , much further out than the region of the observed s stars ( gerhard 2001 ) . to supply the s  stars",
    "requires scattering into near ",
    "radial orbits by gravitational interactions with other stars .",
    "however this process occurs on the local relaxation timescale , which would considerably exceed the main  sequence lifetime ( around 10 myr ) of stars of the observed temperatures .",
    "one way out of this problem is to increase the stability of the clusters against tides .",
    "there have been several suggestions that stellar clusters could contain intermediate  mass black holes , making them less vulnerable to tidal shredding ( hansen & miloavljevi 2003 , mcmillan & portegies zwart 2003 , kim et al 2004 ) .",
    "we do not adopt this idea in this _",
    "letter_.    these closest stars have another intriguing property : there appear to be no red giants among them , despite the fact that these would be brighter than main  sequence stars in the infrared k band where the observations are made .",
    "we call this the red  giant depletion problem .",
    "it has been suggested that such stars are destroyed in stellar collisions ( e.g. genzel et al .",
    "1996 ; alexander 1999 ) although collisions have been shown to be inefficient at removing most of the red  giant envelope ( bailey & davies 1999 ) .",
    "a third problem arises from a selection effect for identifying stars moving very close to the black hole pointed out by schdel et al ( 2003 ) .",
    "namely , stars with pericenters similar to the s  stars but much longer orbital periods would spend almost all of their lifetimes far from pericenter moving very slowly , and thus not turn up in proper motion observations . in other words , only tightly bound orbits are easily identifiable , and a valid picture of the origin of the s  stars must explain these orbits too .",
    "we call this the orbit problem .    in this",
    "we suggest a simultaneous solution to the birth , red  giant depletion and orbit problems .",
    "table 1 gives the known pericenter distances @xmath2 and eccentricities for s  stars .",
    "the instantaneous tidal lobe of a star at pericenter has size    @xmath3    where @xmath4 are the masses of the star and central black hole .",
    "table 1 gives the values of @xmath5 corresponding to the observed s star orbits , taking values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 for @xmath4 . in four cases ( including those with the most accurate orbital determinations )",
    "we note that these are of order a few @xmath8 .",
    "this is comparable in size to a low  to  moderate mass star on the agb , with core masses @xmath9 m@xmath10 .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "1 , where we plot the evolutionary tracks for solar metallicity stars of masses 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 m@xmath10 using the _ sse _ code of hurley , pols & tout ( 2000 ) .    we can now ask what would happen to an agb star scattered on to an orbit passing close enough to the black hole that its radius exceeds its tidal radius .",
    "tidal disruption of stars in the center of our own and other galaxies has been discussed in some detail ( e.g. alexander & livio 2001 ; di stefano et al 2001 ; ghez et al 2003 ) . at its first pericenter passage ,",
    "the scattered star loses most of its envelope in a violent fashion , leaving only the carbon ",
    "oxygen core , the shell  burning layers , and a tenuous envelope . observations of the secondary star of the x  ray binary cyg x2 ( casares et al .",
    ", 1998 ; orosz & kuulkers 1999 ) show that it still has hydrogen in its envelope , and that it has a luminosity @xmath11 l@xmath10 despite a mass of only @xmath12 0.8m@xmath10 .",
    "these properties agree with binary evolution models where the secondary descends from a 3.5 m@xmath10 star that has lost most of its mass quite rapidly ( king & ritter , 1999 , kolb et al , 2000 , podsiadlowski et al 2002 ) .",
    "these models suggest that the envelope mass is less than 0.1 m@xmath10 on top of a 0.7 m@xmath10 core , but the star closely resembles a 3.5 m@xmath10 main  sequence star with @xmath11 l@xmath10 .",
    "we expect that an agb star that encounters the black hole will be left with a similar envelope mass .",
    "the star retains the same nuclear luminosity but is much smaller and bluer .",
    "stripped agb stars have luminosities around @xmath13 l@xmath10 and temperatures @xmath14  k , similar to b0 main  sequence stars .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that the s  stars were all red giants which were violently stripped of their envelopes near pericenter .",
    "the nuclear lifetimes of these stripped stars would be a few myr , since they have @xmath15 of envelope available for nuclear burning ( see the discussion ) .",
    "stars must be captured and stripped at a rate @xmath16 to prevent the current population of s  stars decaying on this timescale .",
    "since the tidal interaction is effectively pointlike , the pericenters of the stripped stars remain unchanged by it . as seen from the table , this kind of evolution is possible for the current orbits of at least four of the s  stars .",
    "we discuss the other two stars later ( section 3 ) .",
    "lrrrrrr s2 & 0.6 & 0.87 & 114 & 0.6 & 0.88 & 111 + s12 & 2.2 & 0.73 & 424 & 1.1 & 0.90 & 206 + s14 & 0.4 & 0.97 & 75 & 0.5 & 0.94 & 101 + s1 & 8.0 & 0.62 & 1541 & 10.1 & 0.36 & 1941 + s8 & 0.6 & 0.98 & 116 & 0.9 & 0.93 & 176 + s13 & 6.0 & 0.47 & 1156 & 5.0 & 0.40 & 963 +    stripping stars solves the birth problem : if the s  stars are not main  sequence stars with masses @xmath17 , but instead stripped giants of orginal ( main  sequence ) masses @xmath18 , their ages are greater than 300  3000 myr , allowing ample time for them to be scattered from star clusters further out into orbits with the current small pericenter distances .",
    "the violent tidal mass loss we have invoked leaves the pericenter distances unchanged , but produces the observed tightly bound orbits , as orbital energy is used to remove the stellar envelope .    to see this we compute the energy loss required to take a star from a near  parabolic orbit to a tightly bound one like those seen , and compare it to the energy needed to strip a red giant down to a core of mass @xmath19 and radius @xmath20 .",
    "the loss of orbital binding energy is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the semi ",
    "major axis after the mass loss . to strip the star down to the core plus a burning shell and a very tenuous envelope",
    "requires an energy @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the initial envelope mass .",
    "thus stripping requires @xmath25 the resulting values of @xmath22 compare well with those measured for the s  stars listed in table 1 , and imply periods in the observed range @xmath26  yr . the observed pericenters @xmath27 require eccentricities @xmath28    the idea of violent tidal mass loss thus explains the current tight orbits of most of the s  stars as well as solving the birth problem .",
    "we can extend this to a simultaneous solution of the red  giant depletion problem by noting our conclusion at the end of the introduction above that only tightly  bound orbits are easily identifiable .",
    "red giants on orbits such that they do not fill their tidal lobes near pericenter have periods of many centuries and are very unlikely to be identified as high proper motion objects . hence the only stars potentially identifiable as galactic center red giants lose their envelopes and turn into s  stars instead .",
    "we noted above that two of the s  stars ( s1 and s13 ) would not have filled their tidal lobes as red giants at the current pericenters , despite having similar semi ",
    "major axes and thus binding energies .",
    "these two orbits have significantly smaller eccentricities , implying higher angular momenta .",
    "this strongly suggests that they have been scattered from their original post  interaction orbits by the addition of angular momentum near apocenter . for this to work",
    ", the mean gravitational relaxation time should not be much greater than the nuclear lifetimes @xmath29  yr of these stripped stars . as a guide we use the estimate @xmath30 ( binney & tremaine , 1987 , eq .",
    "( 871 ) , where @xmath31 is the velocity dispersion , @xmath32 the mass of a star , and @xmath33 the stellar mass density .",
    "strictly , this formula needs some modification for the presence of the central black hole , but this should not change things by large factors . ) if stars have been fed into the central regions for a significant fraction of the galaxy s lifetime there could currently be @xmath34 remnant stars ( mostly white dwarfs , but with a few neutron stars and black holes ) orbiting within the central 0.05  pc , giving @xmath35 .",
    "the remnants spend almost all their lifetimes near apoastron , so we take @xmath31 of order the orbital velocities",
    "@xmath36  km  s@xmath37 there .",
    "this gives @xmath38  yr .",
    "this supports the idea that the orbits of s1 and s13 have been scattered once from their original post  interaction forms .",
    "we note that these orbits are not relaxed , and still fairly close to the original ones , as expected if the number of scatterings is low .",
    "stellar  mass black holes produced in massive supernovae may settle into the central parsec by dynamical friction ( morris 1993 ; miralda - escude & gould 2000 ) . in doing",
    "so they may scatter the white dwarfs out of the central parsec .",
    "the resulting central density will be similar to that calculated above ( see also alexander & livio 2004 ) , but the average mass of the stars would be a factor of ten higher , which would shorten the relaxation time .",
    "we have shown that the s  stars can result from violent stripping of red giants near pericenter , making them into rather blue objects .",
    "their subsequent evolution is straightforward .",
    "their nuclear luminosities are essentially unaffected by the loss of much of the envelope , so they evolve at constant luminosity until the remaining envelope mass is burnt .",
    "this takes of order a few @xmath39  yr . their radii shrink and their effective surface temperatures @xmath40 increase during this phase .",
    "the constant total luminosity fixes @xmath41 ( @xmath42 area ) , while the k  band flux varies as @xmath43 , so they become fainter in the k  band as @xmath44 .",
    "this is probably the reason why all the observed s ",
    "stars appear to have very similar temperatures .",
    "a star stripped on the rg branch ( i.e. pre - helium ignition ) has a luminosity @xmath45 l@xmath10 , and with an effective temperature @xmath46  k would not be visible in ir surveys .",
    "we expect the s  stars to remain observable for some fraction of the nuclear timescale @xmath47  yr .    to maintain a steady state , s  stars must be created at the same rate @xmath48 ( assuming of there are of order 5 at any moment ) .",
    "this fixes the rate at which stars must be scattered into near ",
    "parabolic orbits with the very small pericenters observed for the s  stars .",
    "the total stellar tidal disruption rate by the central black hole is @xmath49 yr@xmath37 , scaling as @xmath50 ( wang & merritt 2004 ) . considering the evolutionary tracks plotted in fig . 1 , we find that about 1 % of stripped 14 m@xmath10 stars are stripped while on the agb",
    ". hence the tidal disruption rate of agb stars agrees well with the formation rate of the s  stars in our picture .",
    "the tidal disruption rate derived above implies that gas is injected into orbit about the black hole at a rate @xmath51 .",
    "this is significantly higher than estimates of the black hole accretion rate ( baganoff et al 2003 ) .",
    "however this is not suprising , as the gas still has to lose almost all its angular momentum in order to accrete .",
    "it is likely that accretion is a highly time ",
    "dependent phenomenon , with the eddington limit playing a significant role in determining the growth rate of the black hole mass .",
    "we note finally that our picture implies the presence of a kind of `` oort cloud '' of stellar remnants consisting mainly of white dwarfs around the central black hole .",
    "the dynamical evolution of this system may be very interesting .",
    "moreover the stars in this system must interact with the orbiting gas discussed in the last paragraph",
    ". this may be the origin of the observed x ",
    "ray flares in a similar manner to that suggested by nayakshin & sunyaev ( 2003 ) .",
    "we might expect the gas to virialise with the stellar population , implying x  ray temperatures ( @xmath52  k ) near the black hole .    in a quite general way",
    ", our picture suggests that the stellar populations near the galactic center should show orbital , positional , and surface characteristics determined by their interaction with the central black hole .",
    "we will return to these questions in future papers .",
