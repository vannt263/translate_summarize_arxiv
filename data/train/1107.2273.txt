    "@xcite it is argued that in order to reproduce the quark mass dependence of the rw transition , a @xmath56 dependent fermion coupling , motivated by functional renormalization group analyses @xcite , is required .",

    "[ fig:9 ] we summarize the results on the phase diagram in the @xmath79 plane for the two polyakov loop potentials .",

    ", we have seen that the phase transitions at imaginary chemical potential are shifted to higher temperatures compared to those at real chemical potential .",
    "this implies that dynamical quark mass becomes heavier at fixed temperature ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma - theta_m0 ] ) thus the polyakov loop potential @xmath3 , which is independent of @xmath25 , makes a dominant contribution to the thermodynamic potential .",
    "furthermore , at imaginary chemical potential , the target space of the polyakov loop is probed through the change of the phase @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , a comparison of the resulting phase diagram at the imaginary chemical potential region with that obtained in lgt calculations , yields important constraints on the effective polyakov loop potential .      in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found that as the pion mass in the quark - meson model is reduced from its physical value , an additional critical endpoint appears on the phase boundary at small ( real ) values of the chemical potential . since the coupling to the polyakov loop",
    "is not accounted for in @xcite , the additional cep is associated with the chiral phase transition   in the chiral limit , is presumably due to the neglect of the fermion vacuum loop @xcite . ] .",
    "in this section we explore the dependence of the confinement - deconfinement cep , which appears at imaginary @xmath14 for the logarithmic potential , on the model parameters .",

    "lines appearing for @xmath145 ( the boundary is indicated by the dotted line ) are images of those in the region @xmath146 ; the mapping is defined by the periodicity of the partition function .",
    "we identify the ( pseudo)critical temperature by finding the the maximum of the derivative of the corresponding order parameter with respect to temperature . for real values of the chemical potential , the polyakov loop and its conjugate",
    "are real but take on different values @xcite .",
    "here we use @xmath147 for the definition of the deconfinement transition .",
    "a different definition , based e.g. on the polyakov loop susceptibility @xcite , would lead to a slightly different value of the pseudocritical temperature of the crossover transition .",
    "for the first order transition at large @xmath148 one finds double peaks in @xmath147 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : pd_t - mu2 ] ) . here",
    "we identify the position of the transition with the maximum which smoothly extrapolates to the deconfinement transition at vanishing chemical potential and to the chiral transition at @xmath149 , where the peak structure is simple .",
    "we note that any ambiguity in the location of the phase boundary does not affect the discussion below .",
    "qualitatively the features of the phase diagram can be classified as follows .",
    "the njl sector has a critical coupling @xmath150 for the gap equation to have a nontrivial solution @xcite .",
    "this implies that , with the present three - momentum cutoff , there is no spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry for @xmath151 gev@xmath152 .",
    "therefore , in the upper - left panel ( @xmath153 gev@xmath152 ) , the system is everywhere in the chirally symmetric phase . in this case",
    "the rw endpoint is still a triple point , and the cep of the deconfinement transition is close by , at @xmath154 .    for @xmath155",
    ", there is a chiral transition at vanishing chemical potential . as seen in the upper - center panel",
    ", there is a precursor at imaginary chemical potential for @xmath4 slightly smaller than @xmath156 . the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken in a small region at intermediate temperatures adjoining the @xmath157 line .",
    "this behavior can be understood along the lines presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : analyticinsight ] .",
    "although the boltzmann approximation , eq .  , might not be a good approximation since the system is in the chirally symmetric phase even at low temperatures , the polyakov loop is small so that the thermal contribution is dominated by the @xmath93 term as in eq .  .",
    "since this term is positive in the @xmath158 , it adds to the vacuum term and a non - trivial solution appears at finite temperature where the system enters the broken phase .    as the temperature is increased further , however , the polyakov loop is non - zero and the one- and two- quark excitations contribute to the gap equation , driving the system back into the symmetric phase .",
    "consequently , near the rw endpoint , the chiral and deconfinement transitions occur simultaneously and the chiral transition is also of first order .",
    "note that the lower endpoint of the chiral transition follows the @xmath157 line and arrives at the origin when @xmath159 .",
    "for @xmath160 beyond this value , the chiral transition line enters the @xmath161 half - plane .    .",
    "the left vertical axis shows the chemical potential while the right one denotes the temperature.,width=324 ]    as @xmath4 is increased beyond @xmath159 , the location of the deconfinement cep moves to larger @xmath148 and finally reaches real values of the chemical potential at @xmath162 gev@xmath152 . at the same time",
    ", the chiral transition line moves to larger @xmath140 and @xmath148 .",
    "the behavior of the cep can be directly related to changes of the chiral transition with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "increasing @xmath4 leads to a larger dynamical mass @xmath163 in the chirally broken phase .",
    "moreover , @xmath164 increases with @xmath4 since a stronger scalar coupling leads to larger quark condensate .",
    "this raises both the dynamical mass and the chiral transition temperature . on the other hand",
    ", a modified @xmath4 does not alter the polyakov loop sector of the model .",
    "consequently , near the deconfinement transition , the dynamical mass of the quarks increase with @xmath160 and the system approaches a pure gauge theory owing to the thermal suppression of quark degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_cep ] , the first order phase transition of the pure gauge theory is recovered at @xmath165 gev@xmath152 , only 15% above the reference value .    one may wonder why this mechanism is not effective for the polynomial potential , since it also exhibits a first order phase transition in the absence of fermions .",
    "in fact , we find that the polynomial potential does show the same behavior , but at much larger values of the scalar coupling . the rw endpoint , which is second order at @xmath166 gev@xmath152 , is first order transition starting at @xmath167 gev@xmath152 and the deconfinement cep reaches @xmath168 at @xmath169 gev@xmath152 , 4.5 times larger than the reference value .    the origin of this quantitative difference between the polynomial and logarithmic potentials is due to the much weaker first order phase transition ( smaller discontinuity in @xmath56 ) exhibited by the polynomial potential in the heavy quark limit . at @xmath169 gev@xmath152",
    "we find a dynamical quark mass of about 2.5 gev .",
    "thus , for a quark mass less than 2.5 gev the first order transition is smoothened to a crossover transition . by contrast",
    ", for the logarithmic potential this happens at a much smaller dynamical quark mass of 0.4 gev , owing to the much stronger underlying first order transition .",
    "we note that a first order confinement - deconfinement transition emerges at real chemical potential also in the large @xmath170 limit of the pnjl model @xcite , as explored in the context of the recently proposed quarkyonic phase @xcite .",
    "indeed , the effect of strengthening @xmath4 is similar to that of increasing @xmath170 since @xmath4 and @xmath171 appear in the factor @xmath172 in the gap equation for the dynamical mass ( see eq.(16 ) in ref .",
    "while we suppress the quark contribution to the thermodynamics by increasing the dynamical mass by means of @xmath4 , a large value of @xmath170 is accompanied by a @xmath173 suppression of the quark contribution . both procedures",
    "yield a gluon dominated system and thus give a first order confinement - deconfinement transition .",
    "note , however , that the two procedures differ in detail .",
    "increasing @xmath160 at fixed @xmath171 preserves the polyakov loop potential but modifies the quark mass , while in the large @xmath171 limit at fixed @xmath174 the quark mass remains unchanged but the polyakov loop potential is modified .",
    "this means that when we increase @xmath160 at fixed @xmath171 we change the characteristic scale of the chiral symmetry breaking .",

    "@xmath190 shows a periodicity of @xmath191 in @xmath176 , not @xmath94 which is required by the rw periodicity .",

    "since the periodicity @xmath94 in the imaginary chemical potential is preserved by the rw transition , which is an effect of the polyakov loop in the context of pnjl model , the relation holds for the normal njl model calculation which does not couple to @xmath2 field . in spite of the absence of confinement in the njl model",
