    "this article concerns the asymptotic of @xmath6 under certain tail conditions on @xmath0 , where @xmath7 $ ] with @xmath8 .",
    "specifically , denoting by @xmath9 the class of functions that are regularly varying at @xmath10 with exponent @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the first condition is @xmath13 by ( [ etail - svf ] ) , @xmath14 .",
    "the second condition is the tail ratio condition @xmath15 actually , we often only need the following weaker tail ratio condition : @xmath16    there are several well - known works on the strong renewal theorem ( srt ) for  @xmath17 , that is , the nontrivial limit of @xmath18 as @xmath19 with @xmath20 ; see @xcite for the arithmetic case and @xcite for the nonarithmetic case . the definitions of ( non)arithmetic distributions and the related ( non)lattice distributions are given in section  [ sresults ] . while the srt always holds for @xmath21 $ ] in the arithmetic case as well as in the nonarithmetic case with the extra condition @xmath22 , there are examples where it fails to hold for @xmath23 $ ] ; see @xcite , and also @xcite for explanations . for the arithmetic case ,",
    "a well - known condition that leads to the srt for all @xmath23 $ ] is @xmath24 provided @xmath25 is integer - valued . under the condition ,",
    "the srt was established for @xmath26 in @xcite .",
    "the general arithmetic case remained open until @xcite , which took a different approach from previous efforts .",
    "the core of the argument in @xcite is an estimate of local large deviations ( lld ) for the events @xmath27 as @xmath19 .",
    "once these estimates are established , the rest of the proof is basically an application of the local limit theorems ( llts ) ( @xcite , theorem  8.4.12 ) @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown @xcite that , for the nonlattice case , if @xmath28 where for @xmath29 , @xmath30 then a much simpler argument than the one in @xcite can be used to get the same type of lld bound , which then leads to the srt .",
    "however , condition ( [ edoney ] ) can be restrictive .",
    "as an example , let @xmath0 be supported on @xmath31 and have piecewise constant density @xmath32 , such that @xmath33 then @xmath34 as @xmath19 , where @xmath35 denote constants",
    ". set @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "since @xmath37 for @xmath38 , ( [ edoney ] ) does not hold . on the other hand , the set of @xmath39 with large @xmath40 has low density of order @xmath41 , while the large values of @xmath40 increases slowly at order @xmath42 as @xmath19 .",
    "thus it is reasonable to wonder if the srt should still hold .    to handle similar situations as the example , one way is to control the aggregate effect of large values of @xmath40 .",
    "we therefore define the function @xmath43^+\\,\\mathrm{d}y,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 is a parameter .",
    "we will show that , for example , if @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and if for some @xmath46 , @xmath49 then the srt holds for @xmath17 . since ( [ edoney ] ) implies @xmath50",
    "if @xmath46 is large enough , it is a special case of ( [ eiof ] ) . in the above example , since @xmath51 for large @xmath46 , the srt holds as well .",
    "notice that if ( [ eiof ] ) holds for one @xmath52 , it holds for all @xmath52 . as will be seen , the condition can be further relaxed .",
    "there has been constant interest in the large deviations of sums of random variables with regularly varying distributions and infinite mean ( @xmath53 ) , most notably in the `` big - jump '' domain ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the theme of this line of research is to identify the domain of large @xmath39 , such that the event @xmath54 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 is mainly due to a single large value among @xmath57 .",
    "here @xmath58 are constants such that @xmath59 is tight ; see the definition of @xmath58 in section  [ sresults ] .",
    "the local version of this type of large deviations , with @xmath60 as opposed to @xmath61 in the global version , requires more elaborate conditions on @xmath62 , and it seems that none of the conditions in the current literature allows occasional large values of @xmath63 . as shown in @xcite , to establish the srt , the precise lld @xmath64 is unnecessary , and instead @xmath65 or even @xmath66 can be the starting point .",
    "our results implies the latter is not necessary either ; in the above example , for each fixed large @xmath67 , @xmath68 = \\infty$ ] , because as @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where @xmath72 are constants . on the other hand , as in @xcite , we still need certain estimates of the @xmath73 concentration function of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "these are systematically furnished by the analysis on small - step sequences in @xcite .    as an application",
    ", we will consider the ladder height process of @xmath17 . because @xmath0 is the basic information",
    ", it is of interest to find conditions on @xmath74 that yield the srt for the ladder height process .",
    "it is known that under certain conditions , the step distribution of the ladder height process is in the domain of attraction of stable law with exponent @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the positivity parameter of the limiting stable distribution associated with @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "we will show that , if @xmath77 for some @xmath78 , then the srt holds for the ladder process .",
    "note that since the ladder steps are nonnegative , due to the results in @xcite , only the case where @xmath79 needs to be considered .    as another application",
    ", we will also consider the case where @xmath25 is infinitely divisible .",
    "since the @xmath73 measure @xmath80 of @xmath25 is typically much easier to specify than its distribution function @xmath0 , a natural question is whether similar conditions on @xmath81 can be found for @xmath80 that lead to the srt .",
    "this question turns out to have a positive answer .",
    "naturally , it is more interesting and important to study the srt for @xmath73 processes under a similar setting .",
    "however , this is beyond the scope of the paper .",
    "the main results are stated in section  [ sresults ] and their proofs are given in section  [ sproof - renewal ] .",
    "since other than ( [ etail - svf ] ) , there are no constraints on @xmath82 , we shall always assume without loss of generality that it is continuous and strictly increasing on @xmath83 with @xmath84 , such that for @xmath85 , @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is bounded and continuous , and @xmath88 as @xmath89 ( @xcite , theorem  iv2.2 ) .",
