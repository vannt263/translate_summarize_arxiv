    "plasma turbulence in weakly collisional magnetized plasmas plays an important role in various systems , such as fusion devices and many space and astrophysical situations , where it leads , e.g. , to anomalous transport effects and particle heating .",
    "such plasmas are usually almost collisionless and thus the turbulence problem requires a kinetic approach , especially at small scales where dissipation takes place . in the standard picture , turbulence can be interpreted as a conservative transfer of energy in wavenumber space , from injection to dissipation scales  @xcite . while the fundamental processes in the hydrodynamic case , represented by the navier - stokes equation , are fairly well understood at this point , the turbulence theory of magnetized plasmas is still far from complete .",
    "over the last several years , it has become clear that plasma microturbulence - as described by nonlinear gyrokinetic ( gk ) theory  @xcite - can not be viewed as a straightforward extension of fluid turbulence .    in the 3d navier - stokes system , the _ kinetic energy _ , assumed to be injected into the system at large scales through mechanical forces ,",
    "is conserved by the advective nonlinearity which is responsible for transferring the energy from the injection scales to the smallest ones ( turbulent _ cascade _ ) at which the energy is then dissipated by viscous effects  @xcite . in the gk formalism , on the other hand , the ideal quadratic invariant is given by the _ free energy _",
    "which is subject to a phase - space cascade towards small scales in ( perpendicular ) real and/or velocity space  @xcite .",
    "a kolmogorov - like phenomenological scaling theory of gk turbulence has been developed for the weakly collisional limit  @xcite .",
    "the respective predictions have also been confirmed via direct numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "the main goal of the present work is to extend this work to the moderately collisional regime , focusing , for simplicity , on freely decaying 2d electrostatic turbulence on sub - ion - gyroradius scales .",
    "as it will turn out , our generalization predicts non - universal power law scalings due to multiscale dissipation , and this prediction is confirmed by means of direct numerical simulations .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "an introduction to the gk system of equations in the 2d electrostatic limit and to its global and local energy balance equations is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : system ] .",

    "moreover , in the low collisionality limit , we recover the hypothesis and the results predicted by the standard theory of refs.@xcite , showing that the transition from one case to the other is continuous , as one might have expected .",
    "in the present study , the full gk system of equations is reduced to the simple scenario of a single ion species , electrostatic perturbations , slab geometry with @xmath0 ( thus avoiding parallel effects such as the landau damping and the linear phase mixing  @xcite to be effective ) , and no - response electrons ( which is consistent with @xmath0 ) .",
    "no gradients in the background quantities ( i.e. , the density @xmath1 , the temperature @xmath2 , and the magnetic field @xmath3 ) are considered .",
    "this allows us to focus on both nonlinear and collisional effects , which are the features we are primarily interested in .",
    "we are considering the total ion distribution function @xmath4 to be split into a maxwellian part , @xmath5 , @xmath6 being the thermal velocity , and a perturbed part , @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath8 .",

    "note that , in the periodic case we are using , the gyroaverage can be written as a multiplication by the bessel function @xmath18 , e.g. , @xmath21 .",
    "the term @xmath22 is the nonlinear term and , because of the gyroaverage of the electrostatic potential , it is responsible for the _ nonlinear phase mixing _ process@xcite .    in the absence of collisions , due to the conservative property of the nonlinear term , eqs.([eq : gk - vlasov])-([eq : gk - poisson ] ) admit two positive definite conserved integrals  @xcite .",
    "one of them is quadratic in @xmath7 , which is then proportional to ( minus ) the perturbed part of the entropy ( of the gyrocenters ) , while the other one is proportional to the product of @xmath14 and @xmath7 , which is usually referred to as the electrostatic energy ( or polarization term ) : @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the phase - space element .",
    "note that , using the poisson equation and the local approximation , the electrostatic energy can also be written as @xmath26 the entropy and the electrostatic energy , together , define the free energy : @xmath27 however , when collisions are taken into account , the global energy balance equations read @xmath28 where the collisional dissipation terms are @xmath29\\rangle\\,{\\rm d}\\lambda\\,,\\ ] ] @xmath30\\rangle\\,{\\rm d}\\lambda\\,,\\ ] ] while @xmath31 and @xmath32 are extra dissipation terms due to @xmath33-hyperdiffusion , which will be defined later and will be negligible for the @xmath33-range of interest ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : sims ] ) .",
    "going to the local energy balance equations , in the fourier representation they are    [ eq : loc_energy ] @xmath34 @xmath35    where the spectral density of entropy @xmath36 is defined by @xmath37 @xmath38 where the sum is over all the @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "equivalently , we define the spectral density of the entropy collisional and perpendicular dissipations , i.e. @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively . the nonlinear transfer of entropy @xmath43 is given by  @xcite @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the complex conjugate of @xmath48 and the sum is over all the @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in a similar way , we define a nonlinear transfer term and a spectral density of the electrostatic energy , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively . note that the nonlinear term is the only term responsible for a transfer of entropy or of electrostatic energy between different fourier modes , e.g. between @xmath53 and @xmath48 due to @xmath54 ( which is linear in @xmath55 because of the poisson equation in fourier space ) .",
    "this determines a so - called triadic interaction between the modes @xmath48 , @xmath55 and @xmath53 , which is interpreted as an exchange of energy between modes @xmath56 and @xmath57 due to the property @xmath58 ( from which follows the conservative behavior of this term , i.e. @xmath59 ) .    usually , the nonlinear transfer @xmath60 is interpreted as ( minus ) the divergence of a flux in wavenumber space , i.e. @xmath61 which means that the local energy balance equation has the form @xmath62 where now @xmath63 represents all the possible dissipation sources .",
    "then , one usually assumes a quasi - stationary state ( so @xmath64 after a time - average ) and considers the inertial range ( @xmath65 ) , so the above balance equation reduces to @xmath66 and it can be solved with the help of a closure relation between the flux and the spectrum , if such a relation exists , e.g. @xmath67 however , these arguments apply if the turbulence can be assumed to be in a quasi - stationary state ( which is usually the case for driven turbulence ) and if there exists a range over which the dissipation and the drive is negligible ( i.e. , what is commonly called inertial range ) .",
    "unfortunately , this seems not to be the case for freely - decaying sub - larmor scale turbulence , which is what we are going to study in the present work .",
    "thus a more general approach based on heuristic and physical arguments is required .",
    "for the almost collisionless ( or weakly collisional ) case , a scaling theory of the entropy cascade in sub - larmor scale range has been proposed  @xcite and it has been tested by means of direct numerical simulations  @xcite . however ,",
    "such kolmogorov - style arguments are based on several assumptions , one of which is the existence of an inertial range in which no dissipation occurs .",
    "nevertheless , gyrokinetics can exhibit multiscale dissipation throughout a wide wave number range , as it was shown in recent papers  @xcite . with the present work ,",
    "we want to add a new , simple system to the previously mentioned cases , showing that even in our case multiscale dissipation is present and , moreover , it can also affect the spectra exponents , leading to non - universal power laws .",
    "nonetheless , this work confirms again the weakly collisional theory in the proper limit , extending it in the moderate collisionality limit ( i.e. , where the spectra still have a significant power law component and they are not just an exponential fall off , which would be the case in the very high collisionality limit ) .      before going to the intermediate collisionality case ,",
    "let us quickly review the weakly collisional theory suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite . in our simple system ,",
    "the only term responsible for the energy transfer among modes is the nonlinear term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gk - vlasov ] ) , @xmath22 , from which we can readily estimate the nonlinear decorrelation rate @xmath68 , i.e. , @xmath69 where we have used the large argument approximation of the bessel function , @xmath70 for @xmath71 , since we are interested in the sub - ion - gyroradius scale range cascade , @xmath72 . then",
    ", since our aim is to first estimate the free energy flux , @xmath73 , the next step is to relate the electrostatic potential components @xmath74 to those of the perturbed part of the distribution function @xmath48 .",
    "this can be done through the gk poisson equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gk - poisson ] ) ; in the fourier representation , it reads @xmath75 where @xmath76 , @xmath77 being the modified bessel function . in the @xmath72 limit , @xmath78 and the large argument expansion of the bessel function @xmath18 gives @xmath79 now the nonlinear phase mixing argument comes into play and helps us to estimate the above integral by assuming the correspondence of length scales in real space , @xmath80 , and in perpendicular velocity space@xcite , @xmath81 , due to the nonlinear phase mixing process , i.e. , @xmath82 . in fact , let s assume that @xmath80 is the correlation length of the e@xmath13b flow ( i.e. , of the electrostatic potential @xmath9 ) . since in gyrokinetics the particle drift is determined by the fluctuating fields averaged over their gyro - orbits , particles sharing the same gyrocenter position , but having different perpendicular velocities @xmath83 , are gyro - averaging over different larmor orbits and thus they are experiencing different drifts in real space . if the difference in the larmor radii , and thus in @xmath84 , of such orbits is of the order of the correlation length @xmath80 of the averaged potential , then the two particles are decorrelated and they will perform independent random walks .",
    "this , in turns , mean that the distribution function @xmath7 develops random structures in @xmath83-space on the scales @xmath82 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for further details ) . then , because of the random nature this process , the velocity space integral ( [ eq : gk - poisson_k2 ] ) can be argued to accumulate like a random walk in which the step size scales as @xmath81 and the number of steps scale as @xmath85 , so the typical displacement scales as @xmath86 . in terms of @xmath83-scale conjugate variable @xmath87 ( @xmath87 is for the hankel transform in @xmath83-space what @xmath33 is for the fourier transform in real space ) , this means @xmath88 where the last step comes from the nonlinear phase mixing argument @xmath89 and @xmath48 has to be interpreted  @xcite as the root - mean - square value of the fluctuations in @xmath90 , i.e. , @xmath91 .",
    "now , from eqs .",

    "we now extend the above theory in order to take into account collisional effects .",
    "first of all , let s assume that the nonlinear phase mixing argument , @xmath82 , is still valid and that the decorrelation rate is still given by the nonlinear term , @xmath98 , which is responsible for the conservative energy transfer in wavenumber space . then , with respect to the weakly collisional case , we argue that the scaling between @xmath74 and @xmath48 becomes steeper due to the collisional smearing of the very small velocity - space scales , i.e. , @xmath99 which is estimated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gk - poisson_k2 ] ) with the same argument by which the velocity integral accumulates like a random walk , but now the step is a bit larger than in the weakly collisional case , an effect which is represented here via the @xmath100 correction .",
    "again , we now have to consider the flux of free energy , i.e. @xmath73 , together with the scaling in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi - f_scal ] ) . in this regard",
    ", we do not assume a constancy of such flux as in the weakly collisional case ( i.e. , the existence of an inertial range over which no dissipation occurs ) , but we allow for a @xmath33-dependent @xmath101 due to multiscale dissipation : @xmath102 in general , to take into account the dissipation cut - off , the flux can be expressed as a combination of a power law and an exponential , e.g. , @xmath103 note that , in principle also the exponential parameters depend on the collisionality , i.e. , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "however , we assume that there exists a @xmath33-range over which the flux it is nearly a power law , i.e. , @xmath106 this leads to the following spectra :    [ eq : spectra ] @xmath107    which are in general steeper than the weakly collisional spectra in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectra_0 ] ) , which are however consistently recovered by the limit @xmath100 , @xmath108 .",

    "the nonlinear term introduces a perpendicular ( nonlinear ) phase mixing  @xcite , causing the perturbed part of the distribution function to develop structures in @xmath83-space which are related to those in real space ( or , equivalently , to @xmath33 ) . in particular , the higher the @xmath33 is , the finer those @xmath83-structures are .",
    "however , the relation between @xmath83-scales and @xmath33 is affected by the collisionality of the system , which in practice has the function of limiting the finest @xmath83-scales .",
    "then , due to the relation between @xmath83 scales and real - space scales , this has a direct influence on the @xmath33 scalings between @xmath74 and @xmath48 .",
    "this was indeed shown by means of direct numerical simulations , even if it remains a small effect , provided that the collisionality is not too high .",
    "in addition , allowing for the presence of multiscale dissipation in sub - larmor scale fluctuations has immediate consequences on one of the very fundamental assumptions made by standard kolmogorov - like theories , i.e. , on the existence of an inertial range .",
    "in fact , regarding this point , we have shown that dissipation occurs at all scales , regardless of the collisionality regime and , moreover , that for intermediate collisionality the free energy flux is not even nearly constant anymore .",
    "this leaves a very important fingerprint on the spectra , making in fact the power law collisionality dependent and thus allowing for non - universal power laws .    despite the relative simplicity of the system under study here",
    ", it seems plausible that these results can be generalized and applied to more complicated systems .",
    "for instance , it is reasonable to expect that also 3d gk turbulence in toroidal fusion devices can exhibit variable power law scalings depending on the parameter settings .",
    "such behaviour has indeed been observed before , and the present work offers a possible explanation .",
    "similarly , 3d gk turbulence simulations applied to the solar wind dissipation range display non - universal power law scalings as well as exponential corrections .",
    "again , the present work may provide a key to the understanding of this effect .",
    "follow - up studies will have to clarify if these conjectures are correct .",
    "we would like to thank h. doerk , v. bratanov , h. sceats , g. g. plunk and a. a. schekochihin for very useful discussions .",
    "the research leading to these results has received funding from the european research council under the european union s seventh framework programme ( fp7/2007 - 2013)/erc grant agreement no .",
    "this project has received funding from the euratom research and training programme 2014 - 2018 .",
    "if @xmath196 is the typical velocity scale length between the fluctuations developed by the distribution function @xmath7 in @xmath83-space ( see later in the text ) , then we can define @xmath197 ( see , e.g. , ref ."
