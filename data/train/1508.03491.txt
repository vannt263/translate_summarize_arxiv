    "in the quest to understand why quantum mechanics accurately predicts natural phenomena , it is prudent to investigate the properties that distinguish it from classical mechanics and from other conceivable theories of nature . exploring these properties",
    "leads to the development of algorithms for information - based tasks @xcite , and provides insight into counter - intuitive quantum phenomena such as the prediction of non - local correlations @xcite , teleportation @xcite , and the impossibility of cloning @xcite .",
    "one property that seems particularly unique to quantum theory is reversibility : the fact that any two pure states of a system are connected by a continuous , reversible transformation . by considering the conservation of information , one might reasonably expect reversibility to hold for any physical theory . this is further supported by the fact that reversibility ( or some variant of it ) plays a pivotal role in information - theoretic reconstructions of quantum theory @xcite .    by viewing quantum theory as one of a broad range of so - called _ general probabilistic theories _",
    "@xcite , a growing number of recent results have hinted at a deep relationship between the local quantum state space and the property of reversibility .",
    "for example , hypothetical theories have been explored in which the local state space takes the form of a @xmath0-dimensional ball : for @xmath1 , there can be no continuous , reversible interactions between two identical systems @xcite ; for @xmath2 ( the bloch sphere ) , the only bipartite state space which allows for continuous , reversible interactions is given by the set of 2-qubit quantum states @xcite .",
    "therefore , out of all theories whose local state spaces are balls , only quantum theory is reversible . demanding this local ball structure",
    "may itself be motivated on reasonable grounds ( for example , by a modified form of information causality @xcite ) , thus these results are useful for generating minimal sets of principles which single out quantum theory .    in another popular hypothetical theory known as _ boxworld _ , every valid non - signaling outcome distribution over joint local measurements corresponds to an allowed state .",
    "boxworld is _ maximally non - local _ - meaning that any composite state which is compatible with local states is allowed - thus giving rise to super - strong correlations such as the _ popescu - rohrlich box _",
    "it is known that reversible dynamics in boxworld are trivial : as long as no subsystem is classical , the only reversible transformations of a composite boxworld system are composed of relabelings of measurement inputs and outputs , and permutations of subsystems @xcite . in particular , boxworld is therefore not reversible , because a pure product state can not be reversibly transformed into a popescu - rohrlich box .",
    "in fact , no correlations whatsoever can be reversibly generated between independent systems , demonstrating further that there is no `` church of the larger boxworld system '' in which a boxworld measurement extends to a reversible transformation .",
    "the mathematical structure of quantum theory differs from boxworld in two significant ways .",
    "firstly , boxworld systems have only a finite number of pure states and hence their state space forms a convex polytope , whereas the quantum state space has an infinite number of pure states .",
    "secondly , quantum theory is not maximally non - local , as there exist operators with negative global eigenvalues whose `` reduced states '' are nevertheless valid on their respective subsystems .",
    "we will demonstrate that boxworld s trivial reversible dynamics in fact extends to all maximally non - local theories whose local state spaces satisfy a well - defined dichotomy criterion .",
    "intuitively , dichotomic systems are those for which all maximally informative measurements have just two outcomes ; this is similar to having the information capacity of a single bit , which has recently been studied as a fundamental postulate for local quantum systems @xcite . in the case of polytopic state spaces",
    ", dichotomy is related to the geometric property of having diametrically opposed facets ; in fact all regular polytope state spaces except for @xmath3-simplexes ( i.e. classical systems ) and odd - sided polygons ( introduced in @xcite ) are dichotomic .",
    "we provide a separate proof for the case of odd - sided polygons , demonstrating that classical theories are the only maximally non - local , reversible theories whose state spaces are regular polytopes .",
    "many non - polytopic state spaces are also dichotomic , such as the @xmath0-dimensional balls mentioned above .    these results seem to suggest that reversible dynamics are always trivial in maximally non - local ( and non - classical ) theories . however",
    ", we will also demonstrate that classical correlations can in fact be reversibly generated if one of the local state spaces is reducible ( or decomposable ) into two or more smaller spaces .",
    "this is achieved via an analogue of the classical cnot gate , where one controls on which of these smaller state spaces the state of the system is in .",
    "we leave as open questions whether non - local correlations can be reversibly generated when one or more subsystems are reducible , and whether the irreducibility of all subsystems is sufficient for all reversible dynamics to be trivial .",
    "reducibility has previously arisen in the study of general probabilistic theories , although not in the context of reversibility @xcite .",
    "this article proceeds as follows : in section [ set - up - section ] we describe the formalism of general probabilistic theories ; in section [ transformations - section ] we show how transformations are defined and give a useful necessary and sufficient condition for a reversible transformation to be trivial ; in section [ dichotomic - section ] we show that all reversible dynamics are trivial in maximally non - local theories whose local systems are dichotomic ; finally , in section [ reducibility - section ] we show that non - trivial transformations exist if one or more local systems are reducible , and conjecture that this is a necessary condition for reversible interactions in maximally non - local theories .",
    "in this section we introduce the well - established framework of _ general probabilistic theories _ which provides an operational formalism for modeling the observation of physical phenomena .",
    "this framework applies to almost any theory of nature involving systems whose states inform the outcome probabilities of future measurements .",
    "conversely , it is straightforward to construct new probabilistic models which share many of the geometric features of quantum systems , and to investigate their operational properties with quantum theory . in standard quantum theory ,",
    "a system is described by a complex hilbert space @xmath4 , states correspond to density operators on @xmath4 and effects correspond to positive operators @xmath5 . letting @xmath6 denote the real vector space of hermitian operators on @xmath4 equipped with the inner product @xmath7 , the sets of unnormalized states and effects are both identical to the self - dual cone in @xmath6 which is the set of positive operators . moreover",
    ", the inner product between an effect and a state gives the probability of that effect occurring in a system which has been prepared in that state .    under some basic assumptions , any system in a general probabilistic theory may be represented by means of a real , finite - dimensional inner product space @xmath6 , in which the _ state space _",
    "@xmath8 forms a compact , convex subset . the _ state cone _",
    "@xmath9 is defined as the cone generated by @xmath8 , and the _ effect cone _",
    "@xmath10 is defined as the dual cone to @xmath11 .",
    "conversely , @xmath12 is the dual cone to @xmath13 .",
    "we further assume that the cones @xmath12 and @xmath13 are both pointed and generating , and that there exists a ( unique ) _ unit effect _",
    "@xmath14 such that @xmath15 for all @xmath16 .",
    "a _ measurement _ of the system consists of a set of effects @xmath17 which satisfy the normalization condition @xmath18 . for a system which has been prepared in state @xmath19",
    ", the probability of obtaining the outcome corresponding to @xmath20 is given by the inner product @xmath21 .",
    "note that the normalization condition on the effects ensures that the outcome statistics of any measurement are likewise normalized .",
    "the cone @xmath13 naturally induces a partial ordering on vectors in @xmath6 : we say that @xmath22 if there exists some @xmath23 such that @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath25 for effects @xmath26 , we say that @xmath27 _ refines _",
    "@xmath28 ; for any measurement involving @xmath28 , it is possible to replace @xmath28 by the two effects @xmath27 and @xmath29 and so obtain a new measurement which is at least as informative as the old one ( if not more so ) .",
    "an effect @xmath27 is said to be _ proper _ if @xmath30 , i.e. @xmath31 for all states @xmath16 .",
    "we denote the set of proper effects by @xmath32 , and note that it is a compact , convex subset of @xmath6 .",
    "the notion of a pure state in quantum theory has a natural analogy in the general probabilistic framework : a state @xmath19 is _ pure _ if it is an extreme point of @xmath33 .",
    "likewise , a proper effect is said to be _ extreme _ if it is an extreme point of @xmath32 , and _ ray - extreme _ if it is extreme and generates an extreme ray of @xmath13 . in quantum theory ,",
    "pure states and ray - extreme effects are given by rank - one projectors , and extreme effects are given by projectors of any rank .",
    "note that in 2-level quantum systems , the set of extreme effects ( minus the zero and unit effects ) coincides with the set of ray - extreme effects , whereas in higher - level systems there exist extreme effects which are not ray - extreme .",
    "in this article we are interested in composite systems comprising @xmath34 subsystems of the above type .",
    "a possible measurement on this composite system involves performing a local measurement individually on each subsystem .",
    "we assume that any state of the composite system may be characterized uniquely by the conditional probability distribution @xmath35 giving the probability of the outcomes @xmath36 occurring when the local measurements @xmath37 are performed separately on each subsystem .",
    "this assumption is often known as _ local tomography _ @xcite .",
    "local measurements on the subsystems may in principle represent physically separated events , hence we also assume that the choice of measurement on any single subsystem does not affect the marginal outcome statistics on the remaining subsystems , an assumption known as the _ non - signaling condition _ @xcite .",
    "this condition may be expressed mathematically as the requirement that for @xmath38 , the following sum is independent of the value of @xmath37 : @xmath39 the non - signaling condition implies that states of composite systems have well - defined reduced states which are obtained by `` tracing out '' one or more subsystems as in . for consistency , we require that states of composite systems must have reduced states which correspond to genuine states on each local subsystem .",
    "suppose that for @xmath40 , subsystem @xmath41 is represented by the vector space @xmath42 , with state cone @xmath43 , effect cone @xmath44 , and unit effect @xmath45 .",
    "the _ max tensor product _ of these subsystems is the set of all composite states which satisfy the non - signaling condition and local tomography , and whose reduced states are valid states of the local subsystems .",
    "the max tensor product can be neatly represented in the tensor product space @xmath46 by defining the composite effect cone @xmath13 to be the cone generated by product effects @xmath47 , where @xmath48 ( which we refer to as the @xmath41th component of @xmath27 ) is a member of @xmath49 .",
    "the composite unit effect is given by @xmath50 .",

    ", it will be convenient to use the notation @xmath54 to refer to the tensor product of those components of @xmath27 which belong to subsystems in @xmath55 , for example if @xmath56 then @xmath57 . note that @xmath54 is itself a product effect in the reduced tensor product space @xmath58 .    a general probabilistic theory in which systems combine under the max tensor product",
    "is referred to as _ maximally non - local_. note that any collection of local state spaces can be combined into a maximally non - local composite space , although the theory known as boxworld is a canonical example of this . in boxworld , each subsystem @xmath59 is equipped with a finite set of fiducial measurements indexed by @xmath37 , and each measurement choice gives rise to a finite set of outcomes indexed by @xmath36 .",
    "any non - signaling conditional probability distribution @xmath60 then corresponds to an allowed state on the composite system .",
    "it is well known that boxworld allows for much stronger correlations and information - processing capabilities between distant parties than are achievable in quantum theory @xcite , but that the set of reversible dynamics is extremely restricted @xcite .     and",
    "@xmath61 represent a product state and a maximally entangled state respectively .",

( colour online . ) ]    in quantum theory on the other hand , systems do not combine under the max tensor product .",
    "rather , the composite state and effect cones are both given by the set of positive matrices over the tensor product of the hilbert spaces representing each subsystem .",
    "the quantum cone strictly contains the max tensor product effect cone @xmath13 , as not all of its extreme rays are tensor products of local projectors .",

    "note that we actually only require the weaker condition that on each subsystem the unit effect can be decomposed in two distinct ways as a sum of two ray - extreme effects . a crucial step in our proof was lemma [ adjacency - preserving - lemma ] , which extends",
    "the hamming - distance based argument of @xcite to account for arbitrary local state spaces , and provides a very useful tool in future work on reversibility . a natural extension of this result would be to relax the dichotomy criterion , for example replacing it with the condition that every ray - extreme effect is contained in a fine - grained measurement ( not necessarily of size 2 )",
    "this result also has implications for information - theoretic reconstructions of quantum theory .",
    "as discussed at the beginning of section [ dichotomic - section ] , the existence of dichotomic systems in one s theory can be regarded as a physically motivated postulate .",
    "our result shows that in order for reversible interactions to be possible between dichotomic systems , they can not combine under the max tensor product ; however , very few natural theories are known whose global state spaces are restricted in this way .",
    "this line of argumentation is similar to that of @xcite , in which the existence of a fundamental information unit is central to reconstructing quantum theory .",
    "it can also be seen as a stronger version of the result that the max tensor product is unattainable if one demands that every logical bit can be reversibly mapped to any other logical bit @xcite . in the case of systems",
    "whose state spaces are regular polytopes , we have shown that only classical systems have non - trivial reversible interactions in the max tensor product .",
    "this provides a strong operational reason for why polytopic systems do not describe nature , which may be compared with the result that classical systems are the only polytopic systems in which deterministic measurements do not disturb the state @xcite .",
    "in section [ reducibility - section ] we demonstrated that it is possible to reversibly generate correlations in maximally non - local theories whose subsystems are not classical , as long as at least one of them is reducible .",
    "note that it is possible to maximally violate bell inequalities in such theories @xcite , therefore our results do not imply that such systems are reversible .",
    "this result hints at an underlying relationship between local reducibility and global reversibility , and we have conjectured that non - trivial transformations can _ only _ occur if at least one subsystem is reducible . one promising avenue towards a proof of this would be to exploit the intriguing fact that the reducibility of a cone @xmath214 is equivalent to the ray - extremality of all reversible matrices in @xmath275 , the cone of matrices which map @xmath214 into itself @xcite .",
    "we have further conjectured that reversible entanglement generation is impossible in maximally non - local theories , even if one or more of the subsystems are reducible . in technical terms , this is equivalent to the statement that reversible transformations of max tensor product systems permute the set of pure product states . in @xcite a very simple proof of this was given in the case of arbitrary boxworld systems , by characterizing pure product states according to their inner products with ray - extreme effects and using the fact that the adjoint of a reversible transformation permutes the latter .",
    "it seems likely that this method of proof is extendable to more general systems , and possibly even to all maximally non - local theories ; a first step may be to consider local systems for which each pure state @xmath19 has a unique effect @xmath27 for which @xmath276 , such as @xmath0-dimensional balls . combined with the previous conjecture",
    ", this would constitute a substantial characterization of reversible dynamics in maximally non - local theories .",
    "as we have discussed already , a notable difference between quantum theory and the theories studied in this article is that quantum systems do not combine under the max tensor product",
    ". therefore it would be interesting to explore whether these results can be extended to theories which are not maximally non - local .",
    "the biggest obstacle to this is that the set of composite ray - extreme effects no longer generate all the extreme rays of the effect cone , so that reversible transformations may well map these effects to other types of effects ( as happens in quantum theory ) .",
    "intuitively it seems that a great deal of symmetry is necessary for this to be possible ; it may be that some minor assumptions on the local state space , for example that the number of pure states is finite , will suffice to extend our results to this case .",
    "this line of research will go some way towards settling the open question of whether quantum theory is essentially unique in its continuous reversibility , which would be a major result in our operational understanding of the universe .",
