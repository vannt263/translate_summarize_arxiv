    "the event  is measured from energy deposited in the individual calorimeter cells .",
    "the sum is performed over all cells within the range @xmath214 with @xmath215 ( @xmath216 ) . to study the effects on @xmath53 of the large but finite calorimeter acceptance in the  measurement ,",
    "the  is recalculated as a function of @xmath217 in a @xmath19-jet monte carlo sample ( herwig - showerlib ) . from the measured @xmath53 versus @xmath217 , it is possible to extract the effect of the limited acceptance by extrapolation to @xmath218 .",
    "the calorimeter acceptance bias is negligible above @xmath219 , given that @xmath53 is independent of @xmath217 above @xmath220 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kt1 ] ) . below this energy threshold ,",
    "the bias is very small .",
    "a 0.5% error is assigned below @xmath221 , which decreases linearly to zero at @xmath222 .",
    "in addition to the fit error , there is a 0.5% physics background error on @xmath53 , as discussed in section  [ sec : selec ] .",
    "the calorimeter acceptance error is 0.5% below 15  gev and decreases linearly to zero at 50  gev . at very low @xmath28 s , below @xmath223 ,",
    "the low-@xmath28 bias error quickly becomes the dominant uncertainty .",
    "above @xmath224 in the cc , the leakage uncertainty increases linearly from zero to 0.5% at 400  gev .",
    "there are two biases present in the response measurement : the topology bias and the instrumental background bias . due to the topology bias ,",
    "the measured response is 0.5%-1% low ; this effect is constant as a function of jet energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dphi2 ] ) .",
    "in addition , a constant bias of approximately 0.7% towards a higher response is observed due to instrumental background .",
    "it is difficult to accurately measure and correct for these biases .",
    "the two effects , however , approximately cancel each other , and therefore no correction is made . a 0.5% error",
    "is included to account for any residual bias .",
    "the leakage uncertainty is added linearly to this residual bias , before all the jet energy scale error components are added in quadrature .",
    "the @xmath104 correction is applied to @xmath225 data as measured in the @xmath226 @xmath19-jet sample .",
    "while @xmath104 is expected to be the same at both center - of - mass energies , it is measured more accurately from the high statistics sample at @xmath3 .",
    "verification studies  @xcite , based on independent measurements of @xmath104 in both data sets , show that the response is the same to within @xmath227 .",
    "this number is quoted as an additional uncertainty for jets produced during the low center - of - mass energy run .",
    "the last correction applied is the showering correction .",
    "it compensates for the net energy flow through the cone boundary during calorimeter showering . ideally , the jet energy correction should scale the energy of the reconstructed jet to the particle level . as the particles comprising the jet strike the detector",
    ", they interact with the calorimeter material , producing a wide shower of additional particles . some particles produced inside the cone deposit a fraction of their energy outside the cone as the shower develops , and vice versa .",
    "it is not possible to determine this showering effect directly from calorimeter data .",
    "energy outside the cone may be associated with gluon emission or fragmentation outside the cone at the particle level ( `` physics out - of - cone '' ) .",
    "alternatively , such energy may be related to underlying event , noise , or pile - up .",
    "the correction is derived using the energy per @xmath12 in the vicinity of the jet centroid ( energy density profile ) obtained from both data and particle level herwig monte carlo .",
    "the physics out - of - cone energy ( from particle level monte carlo ) is subtracted from the total out - of - cone energy ( from data ) .",
    "the description that follows is based on @xmath55 jets with physics @xmath228 .",
    "annuli or sub - cones of increasing sizes ( steps of 0.1 ) are defined around the jet centroid .",
    "@xmath229 is calculated as the sum over all cells contained within a sub - cone of radius @xmath8 , with @xmath230 .",
    "contributions from the underlying event , uranium noise , and pile - up are subtracted .",
    "the total out - of - cone ratio , @xmath231 , is defined as the energy deposited inside a large cone taken as the limit of the cluster divided by the energy deposited inside the algorithm cone .",
    "@xmath231 is measured as :    @xmath232    the assumption , based on the measured energy per @xmath12 in the vicinity of the jet centroid , is that the cluster does not extend beyond @xmath233 for central jets  @xcite .",
    "showers produced by central and forward jets inside the calorimeter cover approximately the same area in real space .",
    "pseudorapidity space , however , shrinks towards the direction of the beam pipe .",
    "the cluster boundary , therefore , can not be the same for all pseudorapidity bins . for @xmath228 ,",
    "the limit is chosen at @xmath233 .",
    "this value is increased towards the beam pipe up to @xmath234 for @xmath235 .",
    "the factor @xmath231 includes both showering loss and physics out - of - cone .",
    "the latter , denoted as @xmath236 , is obtained using the same procedure as for @xmath231 from a herwig particle level jet sample reconstructed with the 0.7 cone algorithm .",
    "the showering correction factor @xmath237 is defined as :    @xmath238    where @xmath239 is the amount of energy associated with particles emitted inside the cone at the particle level , but deposited outside the cone in an annulus defined by @xmath240 at the calorimeter level . in the same way , @xmath231 and @xmath236 can be written as :    @xmath241    @xmath242    where @xmath243 is the energy associated with the physics out - of - cone .",
    "@xmath237 can be expressed in terms of @xmath231 and @xmath236 as :    @xmath244    in this paper , the fraction of the shower contained in the @xmath37=0.7 cone , @xmath245 , is measured .    in the derivation of the showering correction described above",
    ", the offset is subtracted from the energy density profiles measured in data . after this subtraction",
    ", the energy density is still not zero outside the cluster limits .",
    "this contribution to the energy density profiles is small and approximately a constant function of pseudorapidity .",
    "it probably comes from particles produced far from the jets ( in a dijet events the two clusters are color connected ) and constitutes one of the largest sources of systematic uncertainty at low energies .",
    "this baseline is subtracted from both the data and the particle level monte carlo , as the best solution to avoid the bias in @xmath17 arising from differences in the baselines observed in both samples .",
    "figures  [ fig : r07_shower_1 ]  and  [ fig : r07_shower_2 ] show @xmath17 versus @xmath246 for the 0.7 cone over all physics pseudorapidities .",
    "the solid curves are fits to @xmath17 versus @xmath246 . in the low energy range ,",
    "the data are fit to either a logarithmic ( @xmath247 ) or a linear ( @xmath248 ) function . at high energies ,",
    "@xmath17 is well described by a constant .",
    "the errors at low energy are dominated by the offset and baseline subtraction , and at high energy by fit errors due to poor statistics .",
    "the bands between dotted lines account for the total uncertainty . at high energies ,",
    "the total uncertainty is 1% ( 4% ) in the central ( forward ) regions for 0.7 cone jets . at very low energies ,",
    "the errors increase up to 1% ( 10% ) in the central ( forward ) regions for the same cone size .",
    "figure  [ fig : diff_cones_sho ] displays the parameterizations of @xmath17 versus @xmath246 for four cone sizes @xmath2491.0 , 0.7 , 0.5 , 0.3 and different @xmath51 regions . at high energies , the error for 0.3 cone jets is 2.5% ( 5% ) in the central ( forward ) region .",
    "the uncertainty increases up to 2.5% ( 10% ) in the central ( forward ) region at very low energies .",
    "note that although the errors increase rapidly for very low energy jets in the forward region , they are not as large in the @xmath28 range of interest .",
    "this is important because the significant variable in physics analyses is not energy but @xmath28 .    showering losses depend on the jet energy profiles in @xmath51-@xmath9 space .",
    "different profiles would translate into different responses .",
    "given that the @xmath104 measured from the @xmath250 and @xmath251 samples are consistent , showering losses do not depend on the   center - of - mass energy for jets of the same energy and pseudorapidity .",
    "the monte carlo analysis described in this section serves two purposes .",
    "first , it provides the jet energy scale to correct monte carlo jets processed through the 0 shower library simulation ( showerlib ) .",
    "second , it proves that the method used to derive the correction achieves its purpose within errors .",
    "the analysis is based primarily on a sample of herwig direct photon events processed through showerlib for simulation of particle showers .",
    "after application of the low-@xmath28 bias , offset , cryostat factor , and @xmath51-dependent corrections , the monte carlo response in the cc is determined using the same procedure as for the data .",
    "figure  [ fig : response_07_banderrors ] shows @xmath53 versus @xmath246 for jets reconstructed with the 0.7 cone algorithm , along with the associated error band .",
    "the response is now uniform over the whole detector . as mentioned in section  [ sec : enedep ] , the shape of the response obtained from a herwig sample processed through showerlib is different from the response measured from data .",
    "in addition to a difference in overall normalization , the monte carlo response increases less rapidly , remaining nearly constant above 150  gev .",
    "some sources of error in the data analysis do not contribute to the monte carlo jet scale uncertainty .",
    "for example , uranium noise , pile - up , and multiple  interactions are not modeled in the monte carlo sample . in addition , physics backgrounds in monte carlo are limited to diphoton events , which produce a negligible effect on the response measurement . luminosity and multiple interaction cuts",
    "are not needed , because only single interactions are generated .",
    "there is also no instrumental background in the monte carlo .",
    "the topology bias is on the order of 1% at 30  gev and becomes negligible above @xmath252 .",
    "limits in the calorimeter acceptance contribute a small error to @xmath53 .",
    "finally , because the full jet shower is contained within the calorimeter in the showerlib approximation , the shower containment error is negligible .",
    "the monte carlo sample provides an opportunity to verify the method used to derive the jet energy scale correction .",
    "this `` closure '' test directly compares the corrected jet energy with the energy of the associated particle jet .",
    "the ratio of these two quantities should be unity for all values of @xmath45 and pseudorapidity .",
    "for the closure test , the underlying event contribution is subtracted from both calorimeter and particle jets .",
    "split and merged jets are removed from the sample , because splitting and merging is not implemented in the particle level algorithms .",
    "figures  [ fig : clo_1 ]  and  [ fig : clo_2 ] show the ratio of calorimeter to particle jet energy before ( open circles ) and after ( full circles ) the jet scale correction , as a function of @xmath45 and particle level @xmath51 .",
    "statistical and systematic uncertainties are also shown . within errors ,",
    "the ratio is consistent with unity after all corrections .",
    "thus , on average , the correction scales the energy of a 0.7 calorimeter jet to the energy of the associated particle jet to within @xmath1820.5% for @xmath165 .",
    "the closure test is also performed for other cones and pseudorapidity bins .",
    "figure  [ fig : cloe1 ] shows the @xmath253 ratio versus @xmath254 calculated for the 0.7 cone jets in seven @xmath51 bins within the range @xmath1 .",
    "all ratios are consistent with unity within the total systematic uncertainties .",
    "the energy calibration was performed for jets observed in  collisions with the 0 detector at fermilab . the work described in this paper",
    "is based primarily on data taken by 0 during the 1992 - 1996  collider run .",
    "test beam data and monte carlo samples are also used in some cases .",
    "the corrections were derived for two center - of - mass energies of the system , @xmath255 and @xmath56 , and are valid in the range @xmath256 and @xmath1 .",
    "the jet energy scale compensates for spectator interactions , uranium noise , response , and showering loss .",
    "the response correction is small , due to the hermeticity , linearity , and good @xmath26 ratio of the 0 calorimeters .",
    "figures  [ fig : mpf_note_err_tot0]-[fig : mpf_note_err_eta100 ] show the magnitude of the total correction and uncertainty as a function of jet energy for pseudorapidities of 0 , 1.2 , and 2 .",
    "the contribution of the individual sources of systematic error are also shown .",
    "the total uncertainty is the sum in quadrature of the individual components . in most of the plots in this paper ,",
    "the fixed cone algorithm with @xmath55 is used as an example , the data correspond to @xmath226 collisions , and the luminosity is set to @xmath257 .",
    "the overall correction factor to jet energy in the central calorimeter is 1.160 and 1.120 at 70 and 400  gev , respectively .",
    "the total uncertainties at the same energies are 0.015 and 0.023 . at lower energies , larger pseudorapidities , and smaller cone sizes , the corrections and errors increase .",
    "the procedure is verified with a monte carlo simulation which shows that the jet energy is corrected by this procedure to the particle level to within the quoted errors .",
