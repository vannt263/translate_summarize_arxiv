    "p - type _ charge carriers are equal at a fixed temperature . so within the constant relaxation time approximation the sign of @xmath0 will be decided by those charge carriers which have dominating effective mass .",
    "thus , it is clearly evident from the eq@xmath54 ( 3 ) that the estimated value of effective mass from the dispersion curves can be helpful to make a qualitative understanding of the sign of experimentally observed value of @xmath0 .",

    "thus , the spin - up channel charge carriers in energy bands closer to the chemical potentials ( @xmath4 = 0 ev ) will mainly contribute in thermopower . from the dispersion curve",
