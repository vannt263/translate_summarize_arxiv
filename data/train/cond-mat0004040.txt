    "<S> the singular nature of noise indicating the tendency of its intensity to zero for the value @xmath6 of the order parameter ( more probably magnitude of @xmath0 ) is responsible for the emergence of a region on the phase portrait in which all trajectories converge to the axis @xmath6 over a finite time . in other words , </S>",

    "<S> on the other hand , the axis @xmath6 on which the noise intensity assumes zero value is singular in accordance with ( [ 4 ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> as shown in fig.1 , above @xmath91 the system is always ordered for any velocity of the noise growth , defined by exponent @xmath25 . obviously , the saddle point @xmath85 and the node @xmath88 merge at the point corresponding to the correlation time @xmath91 .    </S>",
    "<S> the above analysis shows that in systems with @xmath94 the stationary state corresponds to the point @xmath85 whose coordinates are defined as @xmath95 @xmath96 .\\label{35b}\\ ] ] the meaning of these coordinates becomes clear if we proceed to the additive limit @xmath97 : condition ( [ 35a ] ) indicates that the most probable value @xmath1 of the fluctuation amplitude of conjugate force for homogeneous systems has the sign opposite to that of @xmath98 ; according to eq.([35b ] ) , the `` susceptibility '' @xmath99 in this case assumes an infinitely large value . </S>",
    "<S> thus , node @xmath85 corresponds to the stationary state of a thermodynamic system which is unstable to a transition to the ordered phase . </S>",
    "<S> then the phase portrait has the form shown in fig.4a .    at temperatures @xmath100 , the steady state with the coordinates @xmath101 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath102 is formed at the point @xmath88 . in the additive limit </S>",
    "<S> , this point corresponds to the state of thermodynamic equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4 shows that the corresponding phase portrait can be obtained not only upon an decrease in temperature ( see fig.4a ) . </S>",
    "<S> here we stress that the system can pass from equilibrium ( ordered ) domain trough unstable ( disordered ) to stable if we increase the velocity of the noise growth ( see fig.1 and fig.4b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> naturally , a real thermodynamic system in the process of its evolution tends to the equilibrium state eqs.([36a ] , [ 36b ] ) rather than to the unstable state eqs.([35a ] , [ 35b ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the equilibrium state corresponds to small and large values of the exponent @xmath25 for any values of the parameter @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the domain of medium values of the exponent @xmath25 at small noise correlations corresponds to unstable states .    </S>",
    "<S> comparing fig.4a , fig.4b we see that they are distinguished by the location of the attraction node on the axis @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> the general form of phase portraits shown in fig.4 is characterized by the presence of two separatrices with branches @xmath103 and @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> they divide the phase plane into three isolated regions corresponding to large , intermediate , and small values of the order parameter @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the first region is characterized by an indefinite increase in the values of the quantities @xmath0 and @xmath1 with time @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> it will be sown below that this is not realized in actual practice . </S>",
    "<S> the region of intermediate values of @xmath0 in which the system ultimately goes over to a stationary ordered state is most interesting . </S>",
    "<S> it is this region that determines the phase transition kinetics . </S>",
    "<S> the formation of the region corresponding to values @xmath106 is associated with the multiplicative nature of noise . in this region </S>",
    "<S> , the order parameter @xmath9 tends with time to the value @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us analyze the behavior of the system in each of these regions . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose , we consider the probability of realization of a phase trajectory corresponding to different initial values @xmath107 . in accordance with ( [ 14 ] ) , the probability can be written in the form @xmath108 where expressions ( [ 20 ] ) and ( [ 23 ] ) are taken into account and integration is carried out along the corresponding trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence @xmath109 obtained for an exponent @xmath110 is shown in fig.5 ( curves 1 , 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> apart from the trivial increase in probability ( [ 37 ] ) which approaches the origin for values of @xmath111 corresponding to separatrices , the jumps near which the value of @xmath109 can increase insignificantly are observed . outside the region </S>",
    "<S> bounded by the ( outer ) separatrix , we have @xmath112 since @xmath9 , @xmath113 for @xmath105 in this case .    </S>",
    "<S> such a behavior of the probability @xmath109 can be explained by the form of the time dependencies @xmath9 and @xmath114 during relaxation of the initial value . </S>",
    "<S> far away from the region of @xmath115 ( see fig.4a ) , the quantities @xmath1 and @xmath0 rapidly change their values , the change slowing down as we approach this region . </S>",
    "<S> such a behavior can be explained by the fact that the action @xmath116 changes much more slowly near this region than away from it . </S>",
    "<S> this can be visualized by associating the region @xmath117 with the bed of a large river @xcite </S>",
    "<S> .    for values of the exponent @xmath118 , the integrand in formula ( [ 37 ] ) diverges , and the probability @xmath119 assumes zero value for @xmath120 . </S>",
    "<S> typically , this divergence is observed only in the region of phase portrait bounded by the separatrix branch @xmath121 in fig.4b .    in order to explain the form of the dependence @xmath109 </S>",
    "<S> , we analyze the behavior of the quantities @xmath9 and @xmath114 for various values of exponent @xmath25 . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> , we put @xmath122 in eq.([24 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained quadratic equation gives stationary values of conjugate momentum in the limit @xmath123 : @xmath124    thus , for @xmath110 , the system tends with time to the origin @xmath4 , and the attraction node jumps to infinity ( @xmath7 , @xmath125 ) as @xmath25 exceeds the critical value @xmath126 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding integrand in distribution ( [ 37 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath127 is characterized by the sign inversion in the exponent upon a transition through the critical value @xmath126 . substituting eq.([38 ] ) for @xmath110 into the equation of motion ( </S>",
    "<S> [ 23 ] ) and retaining the leading term in it , we obtain the equation @xmath128 which gives the time dependence of the order parameter : @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the integration constant defining the time during which the point gets to the axis @xmath6 . the substitution of dependence eq.([40 ] ) into eq.([39 ] ) at @xmath110 and of the obtained expression into the integral in eq.([37 ] ) shows that the probability @xmath109 of realization of a trajectory in the region @xmath106 of the phase portrait differs from zero ( see fig.5 , curves 1 , 2 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a completely different situation is observed for an exponent @xmath118 . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> eq.([23 ] ) can be reduced to @xmath131 , leading to eq.([40 ] ) in which the factor @xmath132 is replaced by @xmath133 . however , for @xmath134 the expression @xmath135 acquires an exponent with the opposite sign in accordance with eq.([39 ] ) so that it assumes an infinitely large value for @xmath136 . </S>",
    "<S> as a result , the probability eq.([37 ] ) becomes vanishingly small ( see fig.5 , curves 3 , 4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the physical reason behind such a behavior is that the system gets to the axis @xmath6 over a finite time interval @xmath137 , which ensures an infinitely large value of the conjugate momentum @xmath138 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be visualized as the precipitation of condensate ( absorbing state ) of configuration points from the phase portrait domain @xmath106 onto the abscissa axis for @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the condition @xmath137 is satisfied only below the separatrix branch @xmath121 in fig.4b , while in the region @xmath139 we have @xmath140 , and the convergence of the integrand in ( [ 37 ] ) is not manifested . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the equality @xmath112 holds only below the curve @xmath121 ( see fig.5 and fig.4b ) .    in accordance with ( [ 40 ] ) , the time dependence of the most probable magnitude @xmath141 is defined by the exponent @xmath142 whose magnitude determines the fractional dimension @xmath143 characterizing the domain @xmath144 of the phase portrait of a system with multiplicative noise @xcite . in the additive limit @xmath145 </S>",
    "<S> , we have dimension @xmath146 of the phase plane as expected . </S>",
    "<S> this means that as the time @xmath147 , the phase trajectories of the system fill the entire phase plane . </S>",
    "<S> the increase of the exponent @xmath148 leads to a decrease in the fractional dimension @xmath149 which assumes the critical value @xmath150 for @xmath126 . as the value of @xmath25 increases further , the fractional dimension of the set of points on the plane @xmath151 , which is the law of motion @xmath9 , becomes smaller than unity . </S>",
    "<S> the physical reason behind such a behavior is the above mentioned absorption of configuration points by the axis @xmath6 for @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , it must be stressed that the noise correlation time can play role of master parameter as the temperature and produces transition to the ordered state . </S>",
    "<S> moreover we shown that the increasing of the velocity of the noise intensity growth produces appearance of the domain of disordered states . </S>",
    "<S> this domain disappears if noise self - correlation time does not exceed value @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> path integral solution shown that absorbing state appearance is characterized by the vanishingly small probability of the system states realization . </S>",
    "<S> asymptotic time dependence of the order parameter @xmath0 explains picture of absorbing states by the fractal dimension smaller than unity . </S>"
