    "by the @xmath0-body problem for spaces of constant curvature , we mean the problem of describing the dynamics of @xmath0 point particles in a space of constant curvature @xmath1 .",
    "polygonal homographic solutions are solutions to such a problem for which the point particles describe the vertices of a polygon that retains its shape over time .",
    "+ this paper is inspired by work done by diacu @xcite , but research on this type of problem goes back as far as the 1830s when bolyai @xcite and lobachevsky @xcite independently proposed a curved 2-body problem in hyperbolic space @xmath3 .",
    "since then , the problem has been studied by outstanding mathematicians such as dirichlet , schering @xcite , @xcite , killing @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and liebmann @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "more recent results were obtained by cariena , raada , santander @xcite , diacu @xcite , @xcite , diacu , prez - chavela @xcite and diacu , prez - chavela , santoprete @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . for a more detailed historical overview",
    ", please see @xcite or @xcite . + this paper is about the existence of polygonal homographic solutions .",
    "an important reason for studying these objects is that they may give us information about the geometry of our universe .",
    "for example , diacu , prez - chavela , and m. santoprete showed in @xcite , @xcite that homographic equilateral triangles of non - equal masses ( the so - called lagrangian solutions ) exist only in euclidean space and that in the curved 3-body problem the masses must be equal .",
    "because our universe contains bodies of non - equal masses that traverse homographic equilateral triangles , we may assume that , at least locally , our universe is euclidean ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . +",
    "as regular homographic orbits for spaces of constant curvature have been well investigated ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , we will focus in this paper on irregular homographic orbits .",
    "the most general theorem sofar regarding the existence of irregular polygonal homographic orbits is by diacu , who proved in @xcite for @xmath4 :    [ nonequilateraltriangles ] consider the curved @xmath5-body problem , given by equations  ( [ equationsofmotion ] ) with @xmath4 and masses @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 . these equations admit no homographic orbits given by scalene non - equilateral triangles for @xmath9 . for @xmath10 , they do not admit such solutions either if the bodies stay away from the equator .",
    "what we will prove in this paper is the new result :    [ nonexistenceofirregularpolygons ] consider the curved @xmath0-body problem , given by equations ( [ equationsofmotion ] ) , with @xmath2 and masses @xmath6, ... ,@xmath11 .",
    "these equations do not allow for homographic orbits given by irregular polygons if @xmath12 is not constant , where @xmath12 is the same as in ( [ representation ] ) .    of particular interest",
    "is that our proof relies on the irregularity of the polygons alone and does not make use of the values of the masses .",
    "this means that the non - existence of the orbits is determined solely by the geometry of the space .    before we can prove theorem  [ nonexistenceofirregularpolygons ] , we need to formulate a criterion due to diacu @xcite , which will play a key role in our proof .",
    "this will be done in the next section .",
    "in this section , we will formulate a criterion that gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of polygonal homographic orbits . the notation used in this paper",
    "was introduced by diacu in @xcite and makes it possible to use a unified formulation for both the positive and negative constant curvature case , thus greatly simplifying calculations .",
    "+ consider the curved @xmath0-body problem of @xmath0 point particles .",
    "+ we will denote their masses to be @xmath6 , @xmath7 , ... ,",
    "@xmath11 and their positions by the vectors @xmath13 , @xmath14 , + where @xmath15 and @xmath16 furthermore , consider for 3-dimensional vectors @xmath17 , @xmath18 the inner product @xmath19 then , following @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , we define the equations of motion for the @xmath0-body problem as the dynamical system described by @xmath20}{[\\sigma-\\sigma(\\kappa\\textbf{q}_{i}\\odot\\textbf{q}_{j})^{2}]^{\\frac{3}{2}}}-(\\kappa\\dot{\\textbf{q}}_{i}\\odot\\dot{\\textbf{q}}_{i})\\textbf{q}_{i},\\textrm { } i=\\overline{1,n}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we call the solution of ( [ equationsofmotion ] ) a _ polygonal homographic solution _ , or a _ polygonal homographic orbit _ , in accordance with @xcite , if it can be represented as @xmath21 where @xmath22 are constants , the function @xmath23 satisfies @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the _ size function _ and @xmath26 is the _ angular function_. + the main tool of our proof of theorem  [ nonexistenceofirregularpolygons ] is criterion 1 as formulated in @xcite , which states :    consider @xmath2 bodies of masses @xmath6 , @xmath7, ... ,@xmath11 moving on the surface @xmath27 .",
    "the necessary and sufficient conditions for a polygonal homographic orbit as described in ( [ representation ] ) to be a solution of equations ( [ equationsofmotion ] ) are given by the equations @xmath28 where @xmath29",
    "with diacu s criterion in place , we can now prove theorem  [ nonexistenceofirregularpolygons ] :    for the purpose of convenience later on in the proof , we define + @xmath30 and @xmath31 . furthermore , we choose @xmath32 , @xmath33 as in ( [ representation ] ) , @xmath14 .",
    "this can be done by choosing a suitable @xmath34-axis and @xmath35-axis .",
    "+ assume that ( [ equationsofmotion ] ) does allow for homographic orbits given by an irregular polygon if @xmath12 is not constant . then according to criterion 1 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , so @xmath38 as @xmath39 and @xmath40 as @xmath41 . + note that , using ( [ definitionmuandnu ] ) and ( [ definitionsandc ] ) , @xmath42 , so ( [ firstequalities2 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath43 using the definition of @xmath44 and ( [ definitionmuandnu ] ) , we write @xmath45 as @xmath12 is not constant , @xmath44 is not constant either and we may take the @xmath46th derivative of ( [ justmu ] ) , @xmath47 , with respect to @xmath44 to obtain @xmath48 taking the @xmath46th derivatives with respect to @xmath44 of ( [ firstequalities1 ] ) and ( [ firstequalities2a ] ) , inserting ( [ derivativemu ] ) and dividing everything by @xmath49 then gives @xmath50 and @xmath51 we now fix @xmath44 and rewrite ( [ secondequalities1 ] ) and ( [ secondequalities2 ] ) defining @xmath52 where @xmath53 then ( [ secondequalities1 ] ) and ( [ secondequalities2 ] ) become @xmath54 and @xmath55 note that the right hand sides of ( [ secondequalities1i ] ) and ( [ secondequalities2i ] ) are linear combinations of exponential functions in @xmath46 , where @xmath46 can vary in @xmath56 .",
    "these exponential functions are linearly independent , provided their bases are distinct .",
    "the main idea of the proof will be to show that there is a function @xmath57 , @xmath58 , in the linear combinations of ( [ secondequalities1i ] ) and ( [ secondequalities2i ] ) that does not cancel out in at least one of the equations ( [ secondequalities1i ] ) and ( [ secondequalities2i ] ) .",
    "+ let us assume the contrary . for a function @xmath57 to be canceled out , we need to be able to construct a linear combination of @xmath57 with other exponential functions in the linear combinations of ( [ secondequalities1i ] ) and ( [ secondequalities2i ] ) , with identical bases .",
    "such functions can be represented as @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 for which @xmath63 , @xmath64 . however , due to ( [ definitionaandg ] ) , @xmath63 can only be the case if @xmath65 and @xmath64 can only be the case if @xmath66 . + we need to take a closer look at the case that @xmath65 .",
    "after that , we will make some further remarks about @xmath61 , @xmath62 for which @xmath65 and @xmath66 hold respectively , which will then allow us to move on to the final part of our proof .",
    "+ for the case that @xmath65 , we have that by ( [ definitionsandc ] ) , @xmath67 or @xmath68 consequently , this implies for ( [ possibility1 ] ) that @xmath69 note that by construction @xmath70 combining ( [ constructioninequality ] ) with ( [ possibility1b ] ) , we get @xmath71 so if ( [ possibility1 ] ) holds , then @xmath72 , so @xmath73 and thus + @xmath74 .",
    "if we assume that for every @xmath75 a @xmath61 exists such that ( [ possibility1 ] ) is true , then @xmath76 so @xmath77 for all @xmath78 . however , we assumed that our polygon was not regular , so there must be at least one @xmath78 for which ( [ possibility2 ] ) holds and ( [ possibility1 ] ) does not .",
    "this @xmath75 will give us the desired contradiction .",
    "+ before moving on to the last part of the proof , we should make the following observations : if there is a @xmath79 such that @xmath66 , then either @xmath80 , or @xmath81 .",
    "since @xmath82 and @xmath83 , @xmath80 would mean that @xmath84 .",

    "+ if @xmath87 , then , as @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , as @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the smallest angles available .",
    "however , @xmath93 , so @xmath94 .",
    "+ from this we derive :    * if there is a @xmath79 such that @xmath66 , then @xmath79 is unique , @xmath95 and @xmath96 . * if there is a @xmath61 such that ( [ possibility2 ] ) holds , then @xmath61 is unique , @xmath85 and @xmath97 .",
