    "for the most part we have obtained only a phenomenological description of the nuclear force . whether using meson exchange potentials or effective field theory , the parameters of the internucleon interaction are hard to relate directly to qcd .",
    "however i will show that we know enough to understand the quark mass dependence of the nuclear central interaction with reasonable control .",
    "i will use this to describe the strength of the nuclear interaction in the chiral limit .",
    "we will see that there exists a strong variation of the strength , which nevertheless comes from readily understandable physics .",
    "the basic framework will use a dispersive representation for the scalar - isoscalar interaction .",
    "the overall strength will be governed by a contact interaction @xmath3 the strength of this interaction will be related to a dispersion relation@xcite @xmath4 here the spectral function in the integrand @xmath5 is to be calculated from physical intermediate states of two - pion exchange , using chiral amplitudes at low energy plus the omnes function for pion rescattering .",
    "we can control the mass dependence of these ingredients to a great extent using chiral perturbation theory .",
    "+     + @xmath6 +    let us at this stage show the basic result , to be developed more fully below .",
    "the spectral function for the physical case was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was shown to reproduce the shape and magnitude expected from past experience with scalar exchange .",
    "this result , with a small modification to be described below , is shown in fig . 1 . also shown is the result that will be developed for the spectral function in the chiral limit .",
    "the integral under theses curves gives the strength of the scalar interaction '' resonance ] .",
    "the chiral limit is seen to have a greater strength largely because the threshold extends down to zero energy and the spectral function develops quickly . as will be discussed more fully below , there is some modeling involved in producing these spectral functions , and there are some gaps in our understanding of mass effects .",
    "however , the bulk of the change in the chiral limit comes from relatively low energies , where we have better control over the calculation .",
    "these low energy effects are easy to defend as predictions of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "these contact interactions enter modern descriptions of nuclear binding .",
    "they have been developed in a systematic fashion in the treatment of light nuclei . below i",
    "will also discuss the modification in the binding energy in heavy nuclei using the contact interactions .",
    "we will find a large increase in the binding energy per nucleon .    in chiral perturbation theory",
    ", the coupling constants will have an expansion in the pion mass .",
    "the leading terms will be @xmath7 equivalently one sees also the parameter @xmath8 defined .",
    "i will use my results to generate a value for the chiral slope , @xmath2 .",
    "the results indicate rather large shifts as one goes to the chiral limit .",
    "in particular , i will find @xmath9 when unexpectedly large effects are found , it is important to carefully understand their origin and assess whether the effects are reasonable .",
    "i spend considerable effort on this task in this paper and we can in fact understand why a large effect is found .",
    "in section 2 , i describe some properties of effective field theory that make it reasonable that such a large mass variation exists . in section 3",
    ", the basic framework is displayed .",
    "section 4 discusses the leading chiral amplitudes for the spectral function .",

    "the slope away from the chiral limit @xmath2 is extracted in section 8 . finally in section 9",
    "i briefly summarize the results and discuss the relation of this work to previous treatments of the nuclear force in the chiral limit@xcite .",
    "there is a dichotomy between the way that we describe the philosophy of effective field theory and and the way that we implement it in practice .",
    "the difference is important for the understanding of the present problem .",
    "let me introduce these notions through a simpler problem which is by now well understood , and which also has an anomalously large mass dependence - namely the pion and kaon electromagnetic mass splitting .",
    "i then show how this philosophy is relevant to the problem of the scalar interaction in nuclei .",
    "an effective field theory is the description of the low energy limit of a theory , with the correct degrees of freedom and interactions for the low energy world .",
    "as originally explained by wilson@xcite , we describe the low energy interaction below some scale @xmath10 by the propagation of the light degrees of freedom .",
    "the high energy effects above the scale @xmath10 are incorporated into a set of local lagrangians .",
    "they must be local at energies @xmath11 due to the uncertainty principle .",
    "we then have a clear way of separating low energy effects , which we can readily calculate , from high energy effects , which we often can not calculate but which can readily parameterized .    however , this is not how we generally proceed in practice .",
    "the use of a cutoff @xmath10 to separate low energy from high energy is awkward .",
    "energy cutoffs require care in order to not violate lorentz invariance , gauge invariance and/or chiral symmetry . in practice",
    "we generally calculate using dimensional regularization .",
    "however , this scheme does not have a separation between low energy and high energy - all scales are integrated over in loop diagrams .",
    "this is not a problem in principle .",
    "extra or missing contributions can be adjusted by a shift in the values of the contact interactions . however , and this will be our topic here , unexpectedly large mass effects can occur if large _ low energy _ contributions are put into the contact interaction .",
    "fmfemloop6 @xmath12    @xmath13",
    "let us explore this first in the context of the pion electromagnetic mass difference .",
    "this is described by the chiral lagrangian @xmath14 in usual notation .",
    "one consequence of this is the equality of the electromagnetic mass splitting of pions and kaons @xmath15 which is known as dashen s theorem@xcite .",
    "normally corrections to this would be expected to be of order 25% from the naive dimensional analysis estimate of su(3 ) breaking due to quark mass differences . however",
    "direct calculation of the mass differences in chiral - based models yields a 100% violation of dashen s theorem@xcite .",
    "the reason why the models are right and the naive dimensional analysis estimate is wrong has to do with the distinction described above .    in the effective field theory",
    "the degrees of freedom are pions , kaons and photons . in a wilsonian effective field theory , the quantum effects of the light particles in the diagram of figure 2",
    "should be calculated up to the scale @xmath10 , and only the effects beyond that scale parameterized by the chiral lagrangian with coefficient @xmath16 .",
    "thus in a wilsonian scheme there would be two different contributions : a dynamical contribution of the actual @xmath17 loop diagrams up to the scale @xmath10 and a parameter @xmath16 describing the physics beyond the scale @xmath10 .",
    "there will also be higher order terms in the lagrangian with extra factors of the pion and kaon masses . while we expect only a modest variation of the chiral lagrangian with quark mass - this is the real content of dashen s theorem -",
    "there is no such guarantee for dynamical effects of the light particles .    in dimensional regularization",
    "the structure is different .",
    "the photon loop in dimensional regularization has the form ( for the pion self energy ) @xmath18 the factor of @xmath19 is forced by dimensional analysis - there is no other dimensional factor in the calculation .",
    "because of this factor , the loop does not renormalize @xmath20 , but goes into the renormalization of a higher dimension term in the lagrangian that has extra factors of @xmath19 and @xmath21 - let us call this parameter @xmath22 .",
    "so in dimensional regularization there is no residual dynamical loop contribution , and",
    "the analysis only involves the parameters of the chiral lagrangian treated at tree level .",
    "+ @xmath23 +    it is easy to demonstrate that the greatest contributions to the chiral coefficient @xmath20 comes from low energy physics , not from high energy .",
    "there is a dispersive sum rule @xcite for @xmath20 , or equivalently the pion electromagnetic mass difference in the chiral limit , for which data exists . in the chiral limit",
    ", we have @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the difference of the vector and axial - vector vacuum polarization functions - the figure is drawn from my own work on the subject@xcite . ] . in turn",
    "there is a spectral sum rule for @xmath25 , and the input to this sum rule can be obtained from @xmath26 decay data .",
    "the integrand , derived from aleph data , is shown if fig .",
    "we see directly that most of the input comes from low energy .",
    "now consider what happens if we adopt the wilsonian scheme and the dynamical low energy contribution is relatively large .",
    "this dynamical effect can easily ( and does ) have over a 100% variation when comparing the pion with the kaon , because @xmath27 and we are in an energy region comparable to the masses . in this case , even if the mass dependence of short distance physics parameterized by the chiral lagrangian is of normal size , the kaon mass shift can be very much different from that of the pion .",
    "the wilsonian approach is undoubtedly correct in saying that there is large su(3 ) breaking at low energy .",
    "it is readily calculable using just the low energy theory .",
    "however , when doing chiral perturbation theory in the usual fashion , regularized dimensionally , we would miss this effect .",
    "dimensional regularization can accommodate this situation , but it is not the outcome that we would naively expect . it can be done only at the expense of having an anomalously large parameter in the chiral lagrangian .",
    "the mass shift is described by @xmath20 and @xmath22 , which are a priori unknown .",
    "the latter must be taken to be much larger than naive expectation in order to reproduce the large difference .",
    "what has happened is that , in this scheme , important _ low energy physics _ has been encoded in the parameter of the chiral lagrangian @xmath22 .",
    "we normally expect that the chiral parameters are manifestations of only high scale physics but in a scheme like dimensional regularization , that does not have a separation between high and low scales , there can also be low energy physics encoded in the parameters .",
    "the lesson from this is that if low energy dynamical effects make a significant contribution to a process there can be a large mass effect .",
    "this can lead to a larger - than - expected variation in chiral parameters when treated in the usual fashion .",
    "i will now argue that an analogous effect will occur in the parameter @xmath0 describing the strength of the scalar interaction .",
    "that is , we will see that low energy effects are embedded in this parameter and that these effects can have a very large variation .",
    "consider now the two pion exchange contributions to the internucleon potential .",
    "the diagrams and formulas will be given later .",
    "in a wilsonian approach we would calculate explicitly the pionic effects up to some separation scale @xmath10 , and then use a contact interaction @xmath28 to describe the high energy effects beyond this scale .",
    "we might realistically expect that the mass effects in @xmath28 are modest",
    ". however , there can be no such expectations for the explicit two pion calculation if there are significant contributions from energies around the pion mass .",
    "these contributions can vary by 100% as the pion mass is set to zero .",
    "for example , in figure 1 we see that the physical spectral function can only start at @xmath29 while the chiral limit case extends down to zero energy .",
    "the two cases do not get close to each other until above 400 mev , and the integrated values of the contribution below this energy are significantly different .",
    "however this wilsonian approach is usually not carried out in practice .",
    "the interaction in the scalar channel is parameterized by a contact interactions ( or a sigma potential ) and the low energy parts of the two pion exchange are not separately evaluated .",
    "one calculates nuclear binding totally with the contact interaction or the potential .",
    "the consequence of this is that we should expect that the large mass variation of the dynamical two - pion exchange has to be included in the contact interaction , which then appears as if there were an anomalously large mass dependence of this coefficient .",
    "we see in figure 1 that the high energy portion has a modest mass dependence while the low energy component has a 100% variations between the physical case and the chiral limit .",
    "if we were following the wilsonian approach , the parameter @xmath28 would have a small mass variation if @xmath10 were chosen above 500 mev .",
    "however , in a usual calculation the mass variation of @xmath0 , encoded in the parameter @xmath2 , must be taken to be very large in order to account for the low energy effect .",
    "it is this which allows us to understand the large mass effect described in the following sections .",
    "it should be said that there is now an attempt at what i call the wilsonian approach .",
    "epelbaum , glckle and meiner@xcite have been calculating the pionic effects to the nuclear potential in chiral perturbation theory using a cutoff in the spectral integral . when supplemented with a cutoff dependent contact interactions",
    "this is the procedure described above",
    ". it would be good to see this approach extended to the binding of heavy nuclei .",
    "it would be even preferable , without loss of generality , to use the omnes formalism developed in the present paper for the low energy amplitude , even if a cutoff is used .",
    "the omnes function is a required feature of the full answer and tames the growing polynomial behavior of the chiral amplitudes such that there is not an excessive contribution from the energy region around the cutoff .",
    "this procedure is equally general because any mistake that is introduced from the region around the cutoff can nevertheless be corrected for by an adjustment of the contact term .",
    "our procedure begins with the dispersion relation derived by cottingham , vinh mau and others@xcite . for textbook reviews ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the scattering amplitude for two nucleons obeys an unsubtracted t - channel dispersion relation .",
    "@xmath30 the imaginary part of this amplitude is connected to the crossed channel @xmath31 with the important intermediate state being that of two pions .",
    "the overall amplitude is decomposed into partial waves described by their spin and isospin quantum numbers .",
    "the greatest interest in this paper will be on the scalar - isoscalar ( j=0 , i=0 ) channel . by taking the nonrelativistic limit and ignoring the energy dependence in the s channel",
    ", one can define a momentum space potential that depends only on the momentum transfer @xmath32 . using the scalar isoscalar central potential as an example ,",
    "let us define the corresponding spectral function @xmath33 in terms of this imaginary part the potential is defined by the dispersion relation @xmath34 when converted coordinate space this defines an inter - nucleon potential depending on the separation @xmath35 , with a spectral representation @xmath36 for orientation , note that this description would produce the conventional sigma exchange potential with the substitution @xmath37 this would recover the classic yukawa potential in momentum and coordinate space : @xmath38 and @xmath39 however , the @xmath40-function is not a good representation of the physics in the scalar channel",
    ". instead we will use chiral perturbation theory extended to higher energy with the omnes representation to describe the ingredients to the scalar channel .    for all channels except that of one - pion - exchange ,",
    "the potential is short range , and in effective field theory can be represented by a delta function - a contact interaction .",
    "for example , the scalar and vector isoscalar contact interactions would be represented as @xmath41 since the fourier transform of a constant is a delta function , the contact interactions in coordinate space correspond to a constant in momentum space .",
    "these contact interactions are therefore given by the momentum space potential at @xmath42 , i.e. for the scalar or vector channel @xmath43 higher powers of momenta can be accommodated by derivative contact interactions . for the exchange of a narrow resonance ,",
    "the contact interaction has the form @xmath44 , and i will use this relation for the vector meson effect however , for the scalar interaction it is important to have a more complete evaluation , as described below .",
    "the application of chiral perturbation theory to the nuclear force has an extensive literature - for reviews and references , see @xcite .",
    "the pathway using the dispersion relation and the spectral function has been pioneered by kaiser , meiner and collaborators@xcite .",
    "we will find this a very effective description of the nature of the energy expansion for the nuclear interaction .",
    "fmftwopion @xmath45 @xmath46    @xmath47      figures 3d , e , the box and cross box diagrams , have an ambiguous status in the calculation of the contact interaction . in an effective field theory treatment , one includes the @xmath54 vertex in the low energy lagrangian and treats pion exchange dynamically , including loop processes .",
    "this procedure would generate these two diagrams explicitly .",
    "therefore in principle , the correct treatment is to treat the box and cross box separately from the contact interaction . in practice is is not always clear how much of these diagrams are calculated dynamically and how much is parameterized .",
    "this probably accounts for the relatively wide range of values of @xmath0 that one can find in the literature . in a relativistic treatment such as applied in walecka - style models which i use in sec .",
    "8 , one would expect that these terms should not be included in the contact term .",
    "this is because the pion and nucleon propagators are treated relativistically , in which case the box and crossed box diagrams would be calculated directly and should not be double counted by also appearing in the contact term .",
    "for this reason we will not include them in our calculation of the contact interaction .",
    "we are also fortunate that , on a purely practical level , these terms are small compared to the effects that we do study , at least for the scalar central potential .",
    "this is demonstrated in @xcite and and can also be seen in fig 3.15 of ref .",
    "@xcite . as an explicit example , if take the @xmath55 limit of the potential from these diagrams quoted in @xcite , one finds that they generate a shift in the non - analytic mass correction of size @xmath56 where the total result is @xmath57gev@xmath58 . for these reasons we will not use fig 3d , e in our calculation of the contact interaction",
    "a key ingredient in the present method is the use of the omnes function , which incorporates the physical effects of pion rescattering@xcite .",
    "this ingredient is not optional - it is required by unitarity .",
    "moreover the general form of the result is well know within the elastic region .",
    "the amplitude must have the form of a polynomial in the energy times the omnes function @xmath59\\ ] ] here @xmath40 is the @xmath60 scattering phase shift , in our case for the i=0 , j=0 channel .",
    "chiral perturbation theory is consistent with this order by order in the energy expansion .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , it is known how to match this general description to the results of chiral perturbation theory by appropriately identifying the polynomial .",
    "the two pion vertices that appear in fig .",
    "3a , b , c are modified by this omnes function in a way that is strictly analogous to the two pion vertex described in@xcite .",
    "experience has shown that using the lowest order amplitudes supplemented by the omnes function gives reasonably good results up to 700 - 800 mev .",
    "i have elsewhere @xcite applied this formalism to the nuclear central potential using the physical phase shifts matched to the lowest order results in order to generate the spectral function .",
    "the result is very encouraging because it generates the main features known phenomenologically for this interaction .",
    "it was shown that this give good results for the shape and magnitude of the spectral function in the scalar channel . in traditional treatments",
    "this shape is described by a broad low mass `` @xmath61 '' particle , although it is unlikely that such a resonance is present in the spectrum of qcd . in particular , in the treatment of @xcite the spectral function is given by @xmath62 the effect of the omnes function is to reshape the spectral function so that it mimics a @xmath61 even though such a resonance is not present in reality .",
    "i will continue to use this formalism in the present paper .",
    "while the use of the omnes function is rigorous and can be matched to chiral perturbation theory to any given order , the use of only the lowest order amplitudes in this expression is clearly not rigorous except at low energies - it is here that the modeling of the spectral function enters .    we have recorded the chiral amplitudes in the previous section .",
    "the task now is to understand how these amplitudes vary between the physical case and the chiral limit .",
    "there will be several ingredients that need to be explored .",
    "some mass dependence is explicit in the chiral amplitudes .",
    "other dependence is contained in the parameters @xmath63 .",
    "finally there is mass dependence in the omnes function , or equivalently in the @xmath60 phase shifts .",
    "this latter feature requires the most work , and i will address it first .    at low momentum , we have explicit expressions for the @xmath60 scattering amplitudes through the work of gasser and leutwyler@xcite . at higher energies",
    ", our best knowledge comes from a treatment that combines chiral symmetry , dispersion relations , crossing and experimental data@xcite by colangelo , gasser and leutwyler ( cgl ) .",
    "in @xcite i used the cgl phase shifts to construct the omnes function .",
    "however , because of the reliance on experimental data , we do nt directly have the ability to vary the quark mass in this analysis . in order to calculate the omnes function for the chiral limit",
    ", we need to introduce a method to model the high energy behavior of the @xmath60 phase shifts in such a way that we can vary the pion mass .",
    "there exists a good and successful method for extending the description of the chiral amplitudes , often referred to as pad approximation or the inverse amplitude method(iam)@xcite .",
    "this provides an analytic approximation to the scattering amplitudes in a form that is fully satisfies unitary and which can be matched order by order to the results of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "matched to the results at order @xmath64 , one has the result for the @xmath65 amplitude is @xmath66 the second term @xmath67 contains the effects of loop diagrams and hence also has imaginary parts .",
    "the beauty of the iam representation is that this simple rearrangement allows the amplitude to satisfy unitarity exactly .",
    "while the method necessarily differs from the full answer beyond the order to which has been matched , studies have shown that this representation provides a good description of the scattering amplitudes up to reasonably large energies .",
    "for example , the scalar - isoscalar iam amplitude is compared to the physical result of cgl in fig [ phasecgl ] .",
    "+     + @xmath6 +    the description is quite good up to 700 mev , after which it falls short .",
    "the resulting omnes function is also compared to that derived from the cgl phase shifts in fig 5 .. = 850 mev endpoint of the cgl analysis in order that the principle value part of the omnes function integral be well behaved near the upper end . likewise in the iam formalism",
    ", there is a corresponding extension .",
    "as long as this extension is smooth it has little effect on this calculation . ]",
    "again the results are similar , except at high energies where the omnes function is small .",
    "@xmath68    i will use the iam phase shifts as an analytic approximation of the true amplitudes , keeping in mind the shortcomings at higher energies .",
    "the low energy behavior of these phase shifts will then be fully rigorous and the high energy portion will be approximate .",
    "let us immediately look at the phase shift and the omnes function in the chiral limit .",
    "the phase is shown in figure [ chiral phases ] in comparison with the iam approximation to the physical case .",
    "the salient feature is the threshold behavior .",
    "the phase shift in the chiral limit clearly extends down to @xmath69 , and since this is the s - wave , the strength turns on relatively quickly .",
    "the physical case needs to vanish at the physical threshold .",
    "these requirements naturally yields a larger phase shift for the chiral case throughout much of the physical region . at high energies , we see a much smaller difference between the chiral limit and the physical case",
    "this is what should be expected , as the pion mass should make less of a difference at the higher energies.the omnes function follows directly from the phase shifts and also has recognizable features .",
    "this is shown in fig [ chiral omnes1 ] .",
    "+     + @xmath6 +    @xmath70    these results are encouraging for the reliability of the method .",
    "the place where we have the least theoretical control is the upper energy end of the energy region .",
    "the iam does not produce a much variation at these energies , so that most of the variation that we find then comes from physics at lower energies .",
    "moreover , the phase shifts only enter our calculation through the omnes function , and the omnes function is small at high energy .",
    "the true omnes function from the cgl phase shifts is yet smaller , so that the iam does slightly overemphasize the higher energies .",
    "however , since there is not much mass variation at these energies , this is not a serious flaw .",
    "overall , despite the approximate nature of the iam method , there is no reason to doubt the general features of the resulting phase shift and hence the omnes function .",
    "in this section , the evaluation of the contact interaction will be presented .",
    "the key features of the scalar channel ( i.e. the `` sigma '' ) emerge , as reported in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the chiral limit will induce a shift in the scalar coupling that again emerges mostly from low energy two - pion exchange . in performing this comparison ,",
    "i have not varied the strange quark mass , keeping it fixed at its physical value .",
    "in addition to the explicit dependence on the pion mass in the chiral amplitudes and the omnes function , there is also implicit dependence on the pion mass contained in the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath71 .",
    "the dependence has the form@xcite @xmath72 \\nonumber \\\\ g_a & = &   g_0 \\left [ 1 - \\frac{2g_0 ^ 2 + 1}{16\\pi^2 f_0 ^ 2 } m_\\pi^2 \\ln \\frac{m_\\pi^2}{m_{ph}^2 } - \\frac{g_0 ^ 2 m_\\pi^2}{16\\pi^2 f_0 ^ 2 } + \\frac{4 m_\\pi^2 \\bar{d}_{16 } } { g_0}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "while the mass dependence of the pion decay constant is fairly well constrained , the corresponding result in @xmath49 is less well understood .",
    "this will be a significant component of our final error estimate .",
    "the chiral parameters @xmath52 are determined from a chiral analysis of pion - nucleon scattering@xcite .",
    "when used without matching to the omnes function at second order in @xmath19 , as is the case both in the @xmath75 analyses and in this paper , there is an ambiguity as to whether the fitted parameter should be identified with @xmath76 itself or @xmath77 which is the threshold value of the coupling .",
    "since @xmath78 , this makes a difference in the result .",
    "the spectral function is dominantly determined by the parameter @xmath76 , which is however not very well determined , with @xmath79  gev@xmath58 being the quoted value . if we used instead the constraint @xmath80",
    "gev@xmath58 , we would choose @xmath81 .",
    "the overall magnitude of @xmath0 does depend sensitively on the choice of @xmath76 , see @xcite .",
    "however the ratio of @xmath0 in the chiral limit to that of the physical limit is almost completely insensitive to @xmath76 , as will be commented on below .",
    "therefore , i will only quote the ratio as my final result .",
    "although i have explored a wide range of @xmath76 values , the figures were produced using @xmath82  gev@xmath58 , a result intermediate between the two choices mentioned above and consistent with both within errors .",
    "the other parameter choices used were @xmath83  gev@xmath58 ( i.e. @xmath84 ) , and @xmath85  gev@xmath58 .",
    "i have explored the sensitivity of the results to these parameters , and both the magnitude and the ratio are insensitive to reasonable variations .    at this stage",
    "we can put the pieces together .",
    "the chiral amplitudes of eq .",
    "[ spectral ] contain both explicit and implicit mass dependence , displayed above .",
    "the omnes function has further dependence .",
    "the resulting integrand in the spectral sum rule for @xmath0 has been previously shown in fig .",
    "1 , both for the physical case and for the chiral limit .    as described in @xcite , the shape of the spectral function in the physical case provides a reasonable representation of the sigma that traditionally appears in the nuclear potential .",
    "moreover , for reasonable values of the chiral parameters , in particular @xmath76 which has the greatest impact , the physical value of @xmath0 can be reproduced . in this way we can understand the nature of `` sigma exchange '' in the nuclear force .",
    "the sigma is not easily understood in terms of the quark and gluon degrees of freedom of qcd .",
    "it is also not a conventional resonance , i.e. a pole in the scattering amplitude close to the real axis with the scattering phase passing through 90@xmath86 near the pole . in @xmath60 scattering ,",
    "the phase shift is not large near the sigma and careful analysis@xcite reveals a pole on the second sheet which is very far from the real axis .",
    "other approaches have also described an effective sigma exchange without invoking a specific resonance@xcite . in the present case",
    "we have a very simple set of ingredients , each if which is required within its respective domain .",
    "even though the amplitude is not conventionally resonant at 500 - 600  mev , the broad peaking of the spectral function reproduces an effect very similar to a sigma resonance .    since we have analytic control over the ingredients of this calculation we may use this formalism to take the pion mass to zero .",
    "the result in the chiral limit has a similar high energy behavior and the magnitude there is only slightly increased .",
    "what is most striking is the enhancement at low energy .",
    "much of this is purely kinematic .",
    "the threshold in the chiral limit extends down to zero energy and the chiral predictions for the spectral function develops quickly .",
    "to calculate the ratio of the scalar strength in the chiral limit to the physical limit , one compares the integral under the two curves of fig .",
    "1 . the extra weight under the spectral integrand causes the value of @xmath0 to increase significantly .",
    "overall i find @xmath87 this is our primary result .",
    "it will be applied to the nuclear interaction in a subsequent section .",
    "let me attempt to assess the uncertainties in this result .",
    "it is clear that this calculation is not straight chiral perturbation theory , and hence does not share the rigor of that method .",
    "i have modeled the moderate energy behavior in the dispersive sum rule , and neglected all truly high energy effects beyond 1 gev .",
    "we clearly have no control over the effects at very high energy . however , there is no indication either phenomenologically or theoretically that they are very important in the determination of @xmath0 , nor that they would have significant dependence on the pion mass .",
    "we can look at the low and moderate energy uncertainties in more detail .",
    "most of the the shift in the scalar coupling comes from the low energy region .",
    "the threshold behavior is an unambiguous feature - the chiral limit amplitudes must extend down to zero energy and the chiral expansion becomes exact there . even at moderate energies",
    ", the iam representation of the pion phase shifts should be quite good .",
    "the greatest uncertainty in this region is the lack of understanding of the chiral behavior in the pion coupling to nucleons , as the leading spectral representation at low energy has a factor of @xmath88 .",
    "this effect is quantifiable . the uncertainty in the chiral parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 corresponds to an uncertainty of @xmath91 in our final result .",
    "perhaps this uncertainty may be reduced in the future by lattice calculations",
    ". there could be additional @xmath92 corrections to the @xmath93 vertices in addition to that modeled by the omnes factor , so there are clearly other uncertainties at the order of several percent .",
    "the overall strength of @xmath0 depends most heavily on the chiral parameter @xmath76 .",
    "however , the ratio of the chiral limit to the physical case has only a remarkably tiny variation with this parameter . throughout the whole range of @xmath76 considered above",
    ", we find the ratio changes by less than 1% .",
    "thus the uncertainty due to the magnitude of this parameter is insignificant compared to other uncertainties .",
    "one might worry that the treatment of two - pion exchange as a potential , or the use of a contact interaction instead of a potential , would break down in the chiral limit because of the massless pions .",
    "this could be the case if the very long range tail of the potential was significantly modified . within this calculation",
    ", there is no evidence of a problem .",
    "the spectral function also can be used to predict a spatial potential @xmath94 . the physical result and the chiral limit result",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ chiral vr ] .",
    "the shape of the chiral result is quite similar to the physical limit .",
    "+   +     + @xmath6    the moderate energy effects beyond the realm of straight chiral perturbation theory are less quantifiable , but we have reason to believe that they are not large .",
    "in contrast to the low energy effects , there is no reason to expect that these effects are enhanced over the usual expectation of being of order @xmath95 .",
    "indeed we find a reasonably small shift in the spectral function at high energy , so that our explicit calculation is consistent with this .",
    "however , i find it hard to defend that high energy shift as a solid prediction of the method . if i were to neglect all shifts above 500 mev , the main result for @xmath96 would be about 5% smaller .",
    "we can perform a further test by adding some expected higher energy effects .",
    "one uncertainly that we are able to explore numerically involves the energy dependence of the pion vertices .",
    "the two pion vertex would presumably have some formfactor associated with the leading coupling , @xmath76 , which would generate a dependence of the vertex on the momentum transfer .",
    "i have studied this by creating an energy dependent vertex through the substitution @xmath97 as mentioned in @xcite , this modifies the shape of the spectral function somewhat , and changes the integral that determines @xmath0 .",
    "however , the change is modest enough that the desired value can still be obtained by changing the fit value of @xmath76 within the allowed range . in this case",
    "there is a modest increase chiral / physical ratio of @xmath0 .",
    "for example with @xmath98 and @xmath99  mev there is a 29% decrease in the predicted value of @xmath0 at fixed @xmath76 .",
    "however , for the ratio @xmath100 this amounts to a 7% increase leading to the result @xmath101 .",
    "the decrease in @xmath0 and increase in @xmath96 is readily understood .",
    "the formfactor will decrease the contribution at higher values of @xmath102 , but leave unchanged the threshold effects at small @xmath102 .",
    "the former feature will decrease the physical value of @xmath0 , but the new ingredients enhancing the chiral limit will be unchanged .    additionally , in the section describing the chiral slope below , i will mention a puzzle concerning the lack of understanding of the nonanalytic behavior . while it is numerically small , this is also a feature which must somehow be generated from the higher energy portion of the spectral function .",
    "i would summarize this discussion of the uncertainties by giving a final result of @xmath103",
    "also contributing to the central force is the dispersive channel involving three pions in an @xmath104 state -i.e . the @xmath105 exchange channel . in this section , i will estimate the modification of this strength in the chiral limit .",
    "the change is very slight , and the net effect on nuclear binding is so small that it is well below even the uncertainty of the result in the scalar channel .",
    "the reason for this is clear - the @xmath106 channel is very small at threshold and hence the threshold sensitivity that the scalar channel exhibited is absent .",
    "the chiral modification has the natural size of order @xmath107 .    in the dispersion relation @xmath108",
    "the spectral function @xmath109 is small at low energy . in chiral perturbation theory",
    "it arises first as the cut in a two loop diagram , and hence is higher order in the energy expansion .",
    "there is also a kinematic suppression since the 3 pions are in a total spin - one state .",
    "both theoretically and phenomenologically there seems to be little strength in this channel , see e.g. @xcite , until one reaches the energy of the @xmath110 , which is a narrow resonance coupled essentially entirely to three pions .",
    "after the @xmath110 , there is not another three pion resonance until well over 1  gev .",
    "it is then a reasonable approximation to take the vector spectral function dominated by the narrow resonance @xmath110 .",
    "we need to understand how the properties of the @xmath110 - i.e. its mass and coupling - are modified in the chiral limit .",
    "we can estimate its mass in the chiral limit from the su(3 ) breaking in the other vector mesons .",
    "replacing one of the light quarks by a strange quark yields the @xmath111 and replacing two of them produces the @xmath112 .",
    "the vector mesons empirically obey an equal spacing rule .",
    "this leads to a simple linear interpolation formula as a function of the light quark mass @xmath113 : @xmath114 the chiral limit is found with @xmath115 , resulting in @xmath116 this is a 2% shift in the mass .",
    "one can address the quark mass dependence of the vector coupling to nucleons again through the su(3 ) breaking pattern plus data .",
    "the su(3 ) breaking of the nnv couplings themselves is not known well enough experimentally to be of direct use .",
    "however an indirect method can be employed .",
    "there is a phenomenologically successful model for these coupling , called vector meson dominance , that related the nucleon s nnv coupling @xmath117 to the coupling of the vector meson to a photon @xmath118 , defined via @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the electromagnetic current and @xmath121 are known clebsch - gordon coefficients .",
    "the vmd relation is simply @xmath122 , and can be motivated / derived from a dispersion relation argument for the electromagnetic current of the nucleon .",
    "phenomenologically vmd works very well . since there is experimental evidence on the su(3 ) breaking of @xmath118 , we can use that plus vmd as an estimate of the quark mass dependence of @xmath117 .",
    "i have performed a fit to the data involving the neutral vector mesons @xmath123 again assuming a linear interpolation .",
    "the result is a dependence of the form @xmath124\\ ] ] with @xmath125 gev@xmath58 .",
    "the error bar comes from using different data in the evaluation of the su(3)breaking .",
    "the central estimate is then @xmath126    we can combine the vector mass and coupling to determine the shift in the parameter vector coupling @xmath127 .",
    "this yields @xmath128 the variation of both the mass and the coupling constant were mild compared to the dependence that we will estimated for the scalar channel .",
    "moreover , both the mass in the denominator and the coupling constant in the numerator decreased , leading to a very small net effect in the ratio .",
    "the error bar quoted is a generous estimate . in any case , the uncertainty in this coupling is significantly smaller that that in the scalar coupling .",
    "our results clearly have the strength of the attractive scalar coupling being significantly increased in the chiral limit . as i argued in sec .",
    "ii , in effective field theory the most consistent procedure would be to treat the long range components of the two pion exchange dynamically , most likely with a form of a cutoff , and then add the contact interactions to account for the rest of the interaction .",
    "this has not yet been done for heavy nuclei .",
    "however , the use of the contact interactions in point - coupling calculations of binding provide an estimate of the shift in the binding that is appropriate for the present state of the art .",
    "not all possible contact interactions play a significant role in nuclear binding .",
    "the dominant ingredients in the binding of heavy nuclei have been elucidated by furnstahl , serot and co - workers@xcite .",
    "the results can be extracted from fig . 1 and fig . 2 of @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the dominant effects are the scalar and vector contributions , to the leading power of the density .",
    "other interactions play reduced roles , although for a complete understanding of the binding about a half - dozen contact interactions are required .",
    "i will consider only the dominant isoscalar - scalar and isoscalar - vector interactions , and in practice it is only the scalar coupling that has a significant dependence on the pion mass .    using ref .",
    "@xcite , one can read off the effects of the different contact terms i parameterize the results in terms of the strengths of the contact interactions , normalized to their physical values , defining @xmath129 the contributions to the binding energy numbers for @xmath130 ( in mev ) are @xmath131 the first two terms are the effects of the scalar and vector isoscalar interactions .",
    "the third term is the sum of 4 other smaller contributions to the binding energy and kinetic energy contributions .",
    "there is in addition the coulomb energy and a small center of mass correction . for @xmath132 ,",
    "the result is @xmath133    the results of these calculations can be generalized to other nuclei by a parameterization that resembles the semi - empirical mass formula . for local interactions , because the nuclear density is nearly constant in the central region one expects that the binding energy will have a dependence volume , which in turn is proportional to the number of particles @xmath134 , and that interactions that occur near the nuclear surface would have a modified result proportional to the number of nucleons near the surface,@xmath135 .",
    "this suggests that binding effects can be parameterized in terms of behavior in @xmath136 and in @xmath137 . using the results for nuclear matter and for specific nuclei , we find a good fit of the form",
    "@xmath138    our results from the previous sections can be summarized as @xmath139 these numbers produce @xmath140 for @xmath130 , compared to the physical result of @xmath141  mev .",
    "for @xmath132 the corresponding results are @xmath142 mev in the chiral limit compared to @xmath143  mev in the physical case .",
    "finally for the general paramaterization , the results are suggest a shift in the binding energy @xmath144    these shifts are larger than we would naively expect .",
    "there are two ingredients in generating this magnitude .",
    "first is the large shift in the scalar contact interaction @xmath0 .",
    "i have explained at length above why this large shift occurs and why it should be considered natural .",
    "the other ingredient is that there is a strong cancelation between the scalar and vector terms in the expression for the binding energy .",
    "the usual 10 mev / nucleon binding energy is the difference of two significantly larger numbers .",
    "this is understandable from the meson exchange potential description .",
    "scalar exchange provides a strong attractive potential .",
    "vector meson exchange provides the repulsive short range interaction and tends to oppose binding . the fact that the 10 mev of binding energy is far below all other hadronic scales of qcd comes from the competition of these two opposing effects .",
    "when we go to the chiral limit and make the attractive interaction significantly stronger while leaving the repulsive one unchanged , the near cancelation between these competing effects becomes less pronounced and the percentage shift is large .",
    "another way to present the results of this calculation is as the slope in the scalar coupling as one deviates from the chiral limit .",
    "the leading terms in an expansion around the chiral limit are given by @xmath7 where @xmath145 is the result in the chiral limit , and the non - analytic term is @xcite @xmath146 the effect of the @xmath147 term is relatively small , i.e. @xmath148 .",
    "it should be pointed out that the dispersion relation does not exactly reproduce the correct @xmath149 dependence of the chiral coupling .",
    "the cubic mass dependence arises in the dispersive calculation from the threshold behavior of the chiral amplitude .",
    "use of the chiral representation for the spectral function given in eq .",
    "[ rho1 ] leads to a cubic term that is @xmath150 i have checked both the spectral function and the real part of the loop calculation .",
    "this has nothing to do with the unitarization procedure and can not be changed by higher order corrections to the threshold behavior .",
    "while the effect is numerically small , it represents a puzzle for which i do not understand the resolution .",
    "it is fortunate that this nonanalytic term is numerically small and the effect of the disagreement has only a 2% effect on the determination of the slope .",
    "i have extracted the chiral slope by the evaluation of the dispersion integral at several values of the pion mass and performing a fit using terms in @xmath19 and @xmath151 as well as the known nonanalytic term in @xmath149 .",
    "the result of the fit yields the slope @xmath152 the negative sign is indicative of the the fact that the scalar coupling is smaller in the physical case than it is in the chiral limit .",
    "this slope is relatively large for the reasons discussed above .",
    "again , because the ratios of scalar couplings are predicted better than the absolute values , the parameter @xmath2 is much better determined in this calculation than @xmath153 . as seen in the previous section",
    ", the slope of the combination of the two isoscalar effects in the overall nuclear central force is yet larger because of the partial cancelation of the scalar and vector channels .",
    "i have used the chiral results for the low energy behavior of the dispersion relation for the scalar contact interaction , supplemented with a representation for the omnes function , in order to calculate the strength of the central nuclear force in the chiral limit . in the results ,",
    "the largest modifications are seen to come from the low energy amplitudes , which extend down to zero energy in the chiral case .",
    "while there are some uncertainties in the final result , most notably from the uncertainty in the chiral extrapolation of @xmath49 , the key ingredients in the calculation appear clear .",
    "we also understand qualitatively why the effect is relatively large .",
    "since this has been an attempt to calculate the full scalar coupling , i have had to model the high energy contributions . while i have argued that this modeling has not introduced large effects in the final results ,",
    "there is also a way to use this method with the full rigor of chiral perturbation theory . to do this",
    ", one would use the present calculation dynamically and in addition introduce a residual contact interaction to account for high energy effects which have been misrepresented in the present calculation .",
    "this extra parameter would presumably be small and would not be expected to have much mass variation .",
    "this variant of the wilsonian scheme described in sec .",
    "2 would then be a way to implement the effective field theory treatment while capturing the main dynamical results of the present calculation .",
    "there exists in the literature several other works which discuss the nuclear interaction in the chiral limit@xcite within the context of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the present work is different because it is a dynamical attempt to calculate the mass variation in the scalar channel .",
    "previous work has been both more general because this variation was parameterized a chiral coefficient , and also more limited because this coefficient could only be guessed at . in practice",
    "the mass variation found in this paper is larger than the estimates of @xcite , and has a well - determined sign .",
    "another difference is that the previous works focussed on few - nucleon systems .",
    "this requires the addition of single pion exchange , which obviously also has a significant change in the chiral limit .",
    "my contribution here is only on the scalar sector - hence i have limited my comments on binding to the heavy nuclear case for which one pion exchange is not important .",
    "however , it is clear that the results of this paper would push the binding of few - nucleon systems in the direction of _ greater _ binding",
    ". it would be interesting to revisit the few - nucleon case with either the parameter @xmath2 calculated in the present work or with a full wilsonian treatment dynamically including the effects of low energy two - pion exchange .",
    "i would like to thank especially thibault damour for many conversations during the course of this work .",
