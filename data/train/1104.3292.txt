    "the fraction of lopsided galaxies may depend on environment ; e.g. , the eridanus galaxy group counts twice as many lopsided galaxies as the field @xcite , but the ursa major group is similar to the field @xcite .",
    "lopsidedness seems to be the strongest in the outer regions of a disk @xcite .",
    "disk lopsidedness may be the product of tidal interactions @xcite , minor mergers @xcite , asymmetric accretion of fresh gas from the cosmic web @xcite , intergalactic gas ram - pressure @xcite , or an offset between the disk and dark matter halo (  disk sloshing ",

    "* ) .    initially ,",
    "the main way to identify lopsidedness has been a visual inspection of the  column density map , line profile or velocity field of a galaxy @xcite .",
    "in addition , lopsidedness can be quantified using a fourier decomposition of either the stellar image @xcite , the  column density map @xcite , or velocity field @xcite .",
    "however , the fourier analysis has only been performed on small samples of  observations or larger samples of optical ones .",
    "we refer the reader to the in - depth review by @xcite on the lopsidedness phenomenon .    in parallel with the line of investigation into galaxy lopsidedness",
    ", a considerable observational effort has gone into morphological tracers of interaction over cosmological times .",
    "these studies use certain quantifiable morphological parameters of restframe - ultraviolet images of distant and nearby galaxies to estimate the merger rate of galaxies @xcite .",
    "two sets of parameterisations have emerged , the concentration - asymmetry - smoothness by @xcite and the gini-@xmath0 by @xcite .",
    "these parameterisations of galaxy morphology have now been applied on every deep multi - wavelength hubble field to determine merger rates ; in the hubble ultra deep field by @xcite , goods by @xcite and @xcite , cosmos by @xcite and @xcite , gems by @xcite , and the extended groth strip by @xcite and @xcite , as well as local reference samples @xcite .",
    "the different parameterisations of galaxy appearance are sensitive to different stages of an interaction and different interaction types @xcite but are very successful in estimating the galaxy merger fraction and rate over much of the age of the universe .    yet , to date , these studies have been constrained mostly to restframe ultraviolet and optical because these are the wavelengths where interaction - induced star - formation produces high - surface brightness features in galaxies with clearly disturbed morphology at wavelengths where the hubble space telescope can reasonably observe them .    in the previous papers in this series @xcite",
    ", we have shown that a description of the  morphology using these parameters is as sensitive , if not better than , any of the star - formation dominated wavelengths to the effects of interactions .",

    "the relevant input parameters are the central position of the galaxy ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) , and a definition of the area over which these parameters are computed .",
    "the gini parameter only requires the definition of the area and not the central position , making it less sensitive to input error .",
    "we obtained uncertainty estimates from a monte - carlo run , varying the central position of each galaxy and a separate run randomly redistributing the pixel values in the galaxy - area .",
    "cas refers to the now commonly used concentration - asymmetry - smoothness space @xcite for morphological analysis of distant galaxies .",

    "* ) , with g=0 the perfect equality ( all pixels have the same intensity ) and g=1 perfect inequality ( all the intensity is in a single pixel ) . its behaviour is therefore in between that of a structural measure and concentration .",

    ", we can define a gini parameter for the second order moment of each pixel by substituting @xmath29 ( equation [ eq : mi ] ) for @xmath20 in equation [ eq : g ] : @xmath30    this is our contribution to the parameter space to provide an additional handle to characterise lopsidedness and interaction level .",
    "our reasoning was that the gini parameter has the added benefit of using the combined shape of the flux distribution curve ( all the information in the image ) , rather than just a fraction . in @xcite , we found hints that @xmath0 may be not sensitive enough to interaction signature while asymmetry is sensitive to other effects as well .",

    "there is no clear part of parameter space where one could identify only , for instance , the severely ( strongly ) lopsided galaxies .",
    "while the distributions of morphological values are different between lopsided and not lopsided galaxies , there is no clear cut in morphological parameters to discern between the two or separate out weakly and strongly lopsided galaxies .",
    "as it stands , the distributions in figure [ f:2d : hist : mlob ] could be used to compute a probability that a galaxy is lopsided , but this would still have to be followed up with a visual inspection like those in @xcite and @xcite or a fourier decomposition such as the ones in @xcite .    to illustrate further , figures b1 and b2 in appendix b ( _ electronic version _ ) show some typical  maps from the whisp sample for the minimum , mean and maximum values of asymmetry and gini for all four lopsidedness categories ; none , weak , moderate and strong lopsidedness . in our view , these images illustrate how , for instance , asymmetry and qualitative lopsidedness do not measure the same thing . a galaxy can be strongly asymmetric with a lot of flux in a spiral arm offset from the centre of the galaxy , while at the same time , the outer contour may appear much like a ordinary disk .",
    "conversely a strung - out galaxy may appear very lopsided at the lowest  flux levels , but if there is little flux in the outermost part , and a strong , symmetric disk ( with a ring for instance ) , this may not show in any of the morphological parameters .",
    "our parameters are flux - weighted by design but the qualitative visual classification of lopsidedness by the previous authors may not be .    to verify",
    "if the shape of the outer contour alone is a better indication of lopsidedness , we compared the morphological parameters for the images with uniform weighting ( pixel - values set to @xmath39 ) .",
    "the gini parameter , in this case , is of no use as this image is perfectly equal ( g=0 ) .",
    "the asymmetry , @xmath0 and @xmath1 parameters show less change in distribution between the lopsided and non - lopsided populations .    alternatively , in order to parameterize morphological lopsidedness in similar terms as the morphological parameters presented",
    ", one could redefine asymmetry using a specific axis ( requiring the additional input of a position angle ) .",
    "for example , @xcite chose the east - west axis and @xcite chose the systemic velocity axis .",
    "we compared fluxes from either side of the centre of these galaxies for the x and y - axes of the maps ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 , tables a1 and a2 in appendix a , _ electronic edition _ ) and found no relation with the lopsidedness qualifier from either @xcite or @xcite ( see table [ t : swaters ] and [ t : noordermeer ] ) .",
    "lopsidedness can not easily be quantified using the above common morphological parameters or simple variations thereof . at best ,",
    "the histograms in figure [ f:2d : hist : mlob ] can be used to assign a probability of morphological lopsidedness . in light of the fact that the above morphological parameters were developed to discern spirals from ellipticals in the optical ,",
    "their insensitivity to the lopsidedness of spiral  disks is a indication of the extent that they can be used to classify morphological sub - types .",
    "therefore , a fourier decomposition ( similar to * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is still needed to classify and quantify the lopsidedness of galaxies in future large  surveys , such as wallaby on askap or a northern sky  survey with apertif on wsrt or the mhongoose nearby galaxy survey with the meerkat radio telescope .",

    "< , < \" , ]     [ t : frac ]              based on the literature , one expects there be some signal of interaction in concentration , asymmetry , @xmath0 and gini as the galaxy is warped and tidal arms are formed : the interaction spreads flux from the exponential distribution , altering concentration and gini , adds bright knots of stars further from the centre in optical images , changing both @xmath0 and asymmetry , and interaction breaks the overall symmetry of the galaxy s image , also modifying asymmetry . since this parameter space was developed to classify galaxy morphology , one can expect changes in more than one of the parameters simultaneously when the spiral disk is gravitationally disturbed . during the interaction , one can also reasonably expect the disk to return periodically to unperturbed morphological values .",
    "hence , we seek a section of this parameter space where interacting disks spend _ some _ of the several gyr that an merger takes .",
    "the fraction of galaxies in this parameter space , together with and estimate of the typical time spent there gives a typical merger rate for an  survey .",
    "figure [ f:2d : hist : int ] shows the histograms of the morphological parameters ( concentration , asymmetry , smoothness , gini , @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) , for interacting and non - interacting , isolated galaxies , according to @xcite .",
    "the five galaxies marked by @xcite as interacting are included . again",
    "the interaction classification was done by a single observer , introducing some risk of a personal bias .",
    "the remainder of the swaters et .",
    "sample is treated as isolated galaxies but it may contain some ( mildly ) interacting dwarf galaxies .",
    "in fact , given the observational result that lower mass galaxies at higher redshifts ( z=0.2 - 1.2 ) show high fractions of interactions ( @xmath42% * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the real fraction of interacting galaxies may be higher .",
    "we therefore treat the noordermeer sample as the cleanest and consider the swaters sample more for confirmation .",
    "both the cas space and the gini/@xmath0 parameters have been used to identify morphologically disturbed galaxies in the literature and in the previous papers in this series , we established that the uv or fir and the  perspective trace similar structure .",
    "thus , we expect to see some signal of interaction in many of these parameters , notably asymmetry , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the interacting galaxies show high values of asymmetry ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "this is somewhat higher than the cut used by @xcite for optical asymmetry ; @xmath44 but they required @xmath45 as well .",
    "the interacting galaxies have higher values of @xmath0 ; @xmath46 - 1 , which is not too different from the cut used by @xcite .",
    "direct cuts are most commonly used in these parameter spaces .",
    "alternatively , one could define the eigenvectors of the interacting population in the combined parameter space . however , simply excluding the locus of non - interacting galaxies and including most of the merging ones is the best one can do since the interaction qualifier is a subjective and qualitative one , not a quantitative one like the tidal disturbance parameter used in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite do not discern between weakly and strongly interacting .",
    "in addition , the training is likely too small to define eigenvectors .",
    "therefore we use hard cuts in parameter space and compare how well these retrieve the fraction and objects that the swaters and noordermeer papers marked as interacting .",
    "following the example of @xcite , we plot each morphological parameter against the others in figure [ f:2d : spr : int ] for the combined sample and for the swaters and noordermeer samples separately in figure [ f : comp ] .",
    "both samples appear to occupy the same parameter space , so combining them is not an issue .",
    "interacting galaxies are marked .",
    "figure [ f:2d : hist : int ] confirms the assertion from @xcite and @xcite that asymmetry and @xmath0 are parameters sensitive to mergers , and our assertion in @xcite that  is a good wavelength to investigate it .",
    "we define three criteria to select mergers : @xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49 these are the dotted lines in figures [ f:2d : spr : int ] and [ f : comp ] ( equation [ eq : crit1 ] in panels i , iii , vi and x , equation [ eq : crit2 ] in panel v and equation [ eq : crit3 ] in panel ix ) .",
    "we also use three criteria for these parameters defined in the literature : @xmath50 @xmath51 and @xmath52 with the first one from @xcite and the last two from @xcite .",
    "these are the dashed lines in figures [ f:2d : spr : int ] and [ f : comp ] , panels iv - vi , ii and iv respectively .    combined with those from the literature , we list their success rates in table [ t : frac ] . from this table",
    ", it is evident that the criteria from the literature do not translate well to  column density map morphology .",
    "these criteria select too many contaminants . in part",
    "this may be because both gini and concentration are linked and sensitive to how concentrated the image is .",
    "as  maps are more extended , there is a shift in values ( see paper ii , * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath1 parameter criterion performs well , selecting most interacting galaxies with @xmath53 but with quite some contamination , even in the noordermeer sample ( table [ t : frac ] ) which is the cleanest of the two .",
    "therefore , a combination of one or more morphological parameters appears the most promising to cleanly separate an  sample into interacting and isolated galaxies . the asymetry-@xmath0 selection criterion performs better in that it selects a similar fraction of galaxies but it does not agree with either swaters or noordermeer estimate in the case of individual objects .",
    "it does select many more objects in the swaters sample but as we have noted above , one can reasonable expect more dwarfs to be ( mildly ) interacting than the five flagged by @xcite .",
    "the concentration-@xmath0 criterion works best as it selects a similar fraction of galaxies as the visual classification but also agrees on more cases of individual galaxies .",
    "it also agrees well with the swaters selection of interactions .",
    "alternatively , a concentration - asymmetry criterion may well work .",
    "for instance , combining any two of these criteria does not improve the selection appreciably . combining the @xmath1 criterion and the c/@xmath0 criterion ,",
    "effectively is the latter criterion .",
    "we intend to apply these morphological cuts on representative samples of  observations , starting with the complete whisp sample @xcite . to convert these fraction into a volume merger rate",
    ", one needs to compute the representative volume of the survey and a timescale for which merging systems reside in the interaction part of parameter space .",
    "we focus on these timescales in the next paper in this series @xcite , using sph simulations of gas - rich 1:1 mergers .",
    "based on our quantified morphological analysis of galaxies from @xcite and @xcite for which they provided visual estimates of the lopsidedness and level of interaction for  disks , we can conclude the following :    * the two - dimensional morphological parameters can not discriminate between weak and strong lopsidedness as judged visually by previous authors .",
    "however , asymmetry , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and to a lesser extent gini parameters all show a shift in the mean of the distribution of values between the lopsided galaxies and those that are not lopsided ( figure [ f:2d : hist : mlob ] ) . *",
    "we suggest , therefore , that these parameters can be used to assign a probability of lopsidedness ( figure [ f:2d : hist : mlob ] ) .",
    "but future surveys should use fourier analysis to find lopsidedness in the  distribution . *",
    "the fraction of interactions in a sample of  maps can however be determined similarly well using these parameters , as a visual classification .",
    "individual parameters , such as asymmetry and @xmath1 , do not select the interacting systems cleanly ( figure [ f:2d : hist : int ] and [ f:2d : spr : int ] ) . *",
    "combined criteria , using asymmetry and @xmath0 or concentration and @xmath0 , work better ( figure [ f:2d : spr : int ] and [ f : comp ] , and table [ t : frac ] ) and select the right fraction of a sample of galaxies is currently undergoing interaction , as identified by visual inspection . combined with an estimate of the time a merger is selected by these criteria , one can estimate what the merger rate in an  survey is .",
    "the benefits of such a merger rate determination would be less observer bias than a visual classification and a empirical visibility time , determined from simulations .",
    "the parameter space , as we applied it to the whisp  column density maps , allows us to find candidates for lopsidedness and more accurately define the fraction of interacting galaxies , solely from their  morphology .",
    "it remains to be determined how long an interacting disk remains in the interaction part of the morphology parameter space .",
    "this can be addressed with the new generation of simulations of major and minor mergers currently being undertaken ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which include a comprehensive treatment of the interstellar matter in the galaxies during the merger .",
    "the time - scale for which a disk has a morphological interaction signature can then be determined by averaging over the many possible viewing angles .",
    "this timescale and the full whisp sample ( 368 galaxies ) will allow us to estimate the interaction rate of spirals locally , based purely on their  morphology .",
    "this can serve as an additional zero - point for estimates of the merger rate at higher redshift .",
    "upcoming nearby galaxy surveys with meerkat and the widefield askap l - band legacy all - sky blind survey ( wallaby , koribalski et al .",
    "_ in preparation _ ) for the southern sky and northern sky survey with apertif on wsrt will solidify the local universe merger rate estimate , based on  morphology .",
    "the future square kilometre array can subsequently determine the merger rate of gas - rich galaxies over cosmic times ( up to z@xmath341 or better ) .",
    "the great benefit of  surveys to determine the merger rates are the sensitivity of  to interaction and the sensitivity of  surveys to lower mass systems , for which the merger rate is the poorest constrained ( see * ? ? ?",

    "<S> lopsidedness of the gaseous disk of spiral galaxies is a common phenomenon in disk morphology , profile and kinematics . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneously , the asymmetry of a galaxy s stellar disk , in combination with other morphological parameters , has seen extensive use as an indication of recent merger or interaction in galaxy samples . quantified morphology of stellar spiral disks </S>",
    "<S> is one avenue to determine the merger rate over much of the age of the universe . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we measure the quantitative morphology parameters for the  column density maps from the westerbork observations of neutral hydrogen in irregular and spiral galaxies ( whisp ) . </S>",
    "<S> these are concentration , asymmetry , smoothness , gini , @xmath0 , and one addition of our own , the gini parameter of the second order moment ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our aim is to determine if lopsided or interacting disks can be identified with these parameters . </S>",
    "<S> our sample of   maps have all previous classifications on their lopsidedness and interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that the asymmetry , @xmath0 and our new @xmath1 parameter correlate only weakly with the previous morphological lopsidedness quantification . </S>",
    "<S> these three parameters may be used to compute a probability that an  disk is morphologically lopsided but not unequivocally to determine it . </S>",
    "<S> however , we do find that that the question whether or not an  disk is interacting can be settled well using morphological parameters . </S>",
    "<S> parameter cuts from the literature do not translate from ultraviolet to   directly but new selection criteria using combinations of asymmetry and @xmath0 or concentration and @xmath0 , work very well .    </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that future all - sky  surveys may use these parameters of the column density maps to determine the merger fraction and hence rate in the local universe with a high degree of accuracy .    </S>",
