    "the procedure runs as follows : first , construct a noncontractible @xmath75-dimensional sphere @xmath61 in configuration space , then determine its maximal energy configuration , and , finally , `` shrink '' the sphere to minimize this maximal energy .",

    "[ fig : zdisc ] ) . loop ( 1 ) corresponds to a single point on the boundary , loop ( 3 ) passes through the @xmath213-string , and loop ( 5 ) consists of the whole boundary of the disc.,height=151 ]    like the case of the witten anomaly in section  [ sec : wittenanomaly ] , this prevents us from defining the square root of the fermion determinant as a continuous gauge - invariant function of the bosonic background fields .",
    "note that our path of four - dimensional configurations begins in a time - independent , topologically trivial vacuum and ends up in a gauge - transformed , time - dependent and topologically nontrivial one .",
    "it is particularly interesting to see how this global gauge anomaly manifests itself in the space of time - independent fermion states . since the dirac hamiltonian is a _",
    "real _ hermitian operator , we may choose real energy - eigenstates .",
    "concretely , look at the one - dimensional subspace spanned by the eigenstate which crosses zero from below in the picture on the left in fig .",
    "[ fig : sflowz ] . for the background fields , we use an arbitrary loop on the @xmath213-disc , which circumnavigates the @xmath213-string exactly once and which is parametrized by @xmath333 $ ] .",
    "then the energy eigenstate defines a _ real _ line bundle over @xmath46 .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that this bundle is , in fact , the mbius bundle .",
    "a normalized eigenstate @xmath334 transported around the loop ends up as @xmath335 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : moebius ] .",
    "the phase factor found is determined by the berry phase for adiabatic transport @xcite .",
    "the berry phase @xmath336 is of topological origin and does not change under continuous deformation of the loop , as long as the loop of configurations does not touch the fermion degeneracy `` point '' corresponding to the @xmath213-string .",
    "this observation also shows that the boundary of the @xmath213-disc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zdisc ] ) is a noncontractible loop of vacuum configurations , since the real berry phase factor @xmath337 on it can not be continuously changed to @xmath338 .",
    "the variation of the eigenstate along the rim of the @xmath213-disc defines a projective action of the gauge group on the fermionic matter .",
    "there is then a global gauge anomaly , because it is impossible to define a real , continuous , and proper ( i.e. , nonprojective ) representation of the local gauge group on the fermion states .",
    "since the vacuum of quantum field theory is the dirac sea with all negative - energy eigenstates filled , this also means that the second - quantized vacuum state acquires the berry phase factor @xmath337 .",
    "see section 6 of ref .",
    "@xcite for further discussion .",
    "( we take the opportunity to correct a slip of the pen . in the last sentence of footnote 6 in ref .",
    "@xcite , the words `` and vice versa '' must be deleted . )",
    "a similar interpretation of the witten anomaly in terms of a berry phase has been given in ref .",
    "there is , however , a crucial difference between the @xmath213-string global gauge anomaly and the witten anomaly . for the @xmath213-string anomaly , namely , there _",
    "does _ exist a local counterterm in the action which restores gauge invariance , but at the price of violating lorentz and cpt invariance @xcite .",
    "more generally , if gauge invariance is enforced , there appears a new anomaly , the so - called cpt anomaly ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for the main result and ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "the space of finite - energy three - dimensional field configurations of @xmath0 yang  mills  higgs theory ( in short , configuration space ) has nontrivial topology @xcite , which leads to the existence of a new type of classical solutions , the so - called sphalerons .",
    "sphalerons are unstable static finite - energy solutions of the classical field equations , whereas solitons are stable solutions .    in section [ sec :",
    "sphalerons ] , we have explained the topology behind the @xmath76 , @xmath159 , and @xmath213-string sphalerons @xcite of the @xmath0 yang  mills  higgs theory ( [ actionymh ] ) .",
    "precisely this theory appears in the electroweak standard model of elementary particle interactions @xcite .",
    "knowledge of these classical solutions may , therefore , be of great importance to physics .",
    "adding chiral fermions to the @xmath0 yang  mills ",
    "higgs theory , the nontrivial topology of configuration space makes itself felt by the occurrence of spectral flow @xcite , as discussed in section [ sec : sflow ] . in turn , the general phenomenon of spectral flow is related to the possible existence of anomalies which invalidate certain properties of the classical theory , as discussed in section [ sec : anomalies ] .    the spectral flow over a noncontractible loop through the sphaleron @xmath76 is related to the chiral @xmath5 anomaly @xcite , which corresponds to a breakdown of baryon and lepton number conservation in the electroweak standard model  @xcite .",
    "the spectral flow through the @xmath159 and @xmath213-string sphalerons does _ not _ lead to a global @xmath0 gauge anomaly @xcite , because the electroweak standard model has an _ even _ number of chiral isodoublets .",
    "still , there is nontrivial spectral flow ( more precisely , spectral rearrangement ) over configuration space , but its physical implications remain to be clarified ( cf .  refs .",
    "indeed , we need a better understanding of the role of configuration space topology in concrete physical problems , such as the behavior of elementary particle fields at high energies or temperatures .",
