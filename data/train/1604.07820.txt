    "heat conduction is a hot topic in non - equilibrium physics  @xcite .",
    "while there is a large body of works contributing to understand the empirically observed fourier s law of conduction , many issues are still challenging , specially in low dimensions ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for one - dimensional systems , fourier s law takes the form @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the flux , @xmath8 the temperature gradient , and @xmath3 the heat conductivity , that depends on the system and can also depend on the temperature but not on system size . while , for systems with momentum non - conservative thermal noise  @xcite , an - harmonic pinned systems  @xcite , or systems with local reservoirs  @xcite , normal transport ( hence , finite @xmath3 ) is observed .",
    "differently , anomalous transport typically occurs in other one - dimensional model systems  @xcite . in those cases ,",
    "the conductivity can exhibit a divergent dependence on system size and super - diffusion occurs  @xcite , hence the fourier s law is not satisfied .",
    "this scenario has been attributed to momentum conservation  @xcite . in apparent contradiction ,",
    "the fourier s law does hold for the momentum conservative model of rotators with nearest - neighbors interactions  @xcite .",
    "but , in this case , another quantity , the stretch , is not conserved  @xcite . however , when extra mechanical forces act at the extremities  @xcite , counter - intuitive effects on the flux and on the temperature profile occur also in the rotators model .    besides that , it is known that the range of the interactions can bring new features to a system .",
    "ensemble inequivalence , phase transitions , relaxation times that increase with systems size and formation of quasi - stationary states , amongst others , can emerge when the interactions are sufficiently long - range  @xcite . in the present context ,",
    "for instance , the long relaxation times observed in long - range systems  @xcite might affect thermal conductivity .",
    "then , a natural question is : which is the influence of the range of the interactions in heat conduction ?",
    "addressing this issue , which can bring new insights to the above scenario , is the aim of the present work . for that purpose",
    ", we consider a paradigmatic model system governed by a hamiltonian dynamics , which generalizes the rotators model .",
    "it is known in the literature as @xmath9-xy  @xcite , whose parameter @xmath9 allows to adjust the range of the interactions from the nearest - neighbors to the global ( mean - field ) cases .",
    "the model @xmath9-xy consists of a chain of classical rotators , attached to the sites @xmath10 of a one - dimensional lattice , whose dynamics is governed by the hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath11 \\\\                       & \\equiv \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathcal{h}^\\alpha_i                        \\equiv   \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left [ \\mathcal{t}_i + \\mathcal{u}^\\alpha_i \\right ] , \\end{split } \\label{hamiltonian}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the angular momentum , @xmath13 the rotational inertia , @xmath14 the angular position of the classical rotor , and we set @xmath15 in order to get a proper kac prescription factor  @xcite , that guarantees extensive energies in the thermodynamic limit ( tl ) when @xmath16 and is adequate to our ( free ) boundary conditions . in the limits @xmath17 and @xmath18 , we recover the _",

    "n - n ) cases , respectively .    at the two ends of the lattice we apply ( short - range ) heat baths with temperatures @xmath19 , with @xmath20 .",
    "to model each reservoir , we use a langevin heat bath .",
    "therefore , the equations of motion are @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the angular velocity , @xmath23 @xmath24 are the damping coefficients of the langevin force and @xmath25 are white noises with correlations @xmath26 the flux is defined through the energy continuity equation for each particle , @xmath27 and , under the condition of local stationarity , we obtain the flow of heat towards the particle @xmath28 due to the particle @xmath29 @xmath30 hence , we define the flux from the left ( right ) particles towards the particle @xmath28 as @xmath31 in the stationary state @xmath32 , for all @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , the `` temperature '' at each particle position is defined as twice the mean kinetic energy @xmath33 , which allows to depict a temperature profile along the system length .",

    "initial conditions ( @xmath40 ) were set as follows : angles and momenta were randomly chosen around zero ( and the average momentum subtracted ) , within intervals adequate to reproduce the equilibrium temperature @xmath41 for the isolated system , before switching on the reservoirs .",
    "after the thermal baths are connected and a transient has elapsed , the quantities of interest were averaged over at least 30 different initial conditions and along a time interval @xmath42 . without loss of generality ,",
    "in the numerical simulations reported here , we fixed the following values of the parameters of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) : @xmath43 , @xmath44 for all @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .    in fig .",

    "we observe that , in the bulk region , the profiles are almost linear .",
    "the absolute value of the slope is very close to its maximal value @xmath50 for n - n interactions ( @xmath18 ) , but the curves become less steep as @xmath9 decreases . for sufficiently long - range interactions , when @xmath51 , the bulk profile becomes flat , and also more noisy .",

    "the scaled flux @xmath58 , for fixed @xmath9 , is depicted as a function of the size @xmath49 in fig .",
    "[ fig : flux ] , for the same values of the end temperatures considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] . for @xmath9 above @xmath59 , the scaled flux grows with @xmath49 attaining a finite value , like in the n - n limit  @xcite .",
    "differently , for any @xmath9 below @xmath59 , the scaled flux monotonically decays with @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , a distinct behavior of @xmath58 vs @xmath49 emerges for short and long range interactions . in the limit case @xmath60",
    ", the scaled flux presents a neat decay as @xmath61 , indicating that the flux vanishes in the tl .",
    "apparently , a decay towards zero flux also occurs for any @xmath62 .",
    "it is noteworthy that , although the temperature profiles for small @xmath9 are very similar to those observed for chains of identical masses with n - n harmonic interactions  @xcite , differently , in the latter case the flux is significantly non null .",
    "let us analyze the m - f case ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "in the tl , a null current along the chain is expected , because , on the one hand , each rotor interacts with each other rotor with equal intensity , on the other , the contribution of the end rotors ( which are the only ones able to break the m - f symmetry ) becomes negligible compared to the interaction with the bulk .",
    "therefore , the lattice structure where rotors are attached is superfluous and there is not a preferential direction for the flux . from another viewpoint ,",
    "it is as if the two reservoirs were placed anywhere .",
    "even if the current through the chain decays in the tl , there is a flow of energy from the hot to the cold reservoir .",
    "in fact , the end rotors are directly coupled to the heat reservoirs and , as a consequence , there is a current from the hot bath to the first rotor , which is the same current from the last rotor to the cold reservoir .",
    "this current is split in several paths : one is the short - circuit given by the long - range coupling between the two end particles and other paths go through each rotor @xmath45 , that is , passing from the first particle through the bulk particle @xmath45 towards the last one .",
    "but , noteworthily , a net current does not pass `` through '' the chain , then @xmath63 . for a finite system , even if the bulk rotors still interact globally , a small current exists , because in that case the effect over each bulk rotor due to the end rotors is not negligible .",
    "consistently with this view , the current @xmath64 decays with @xmath49 .",
    "this scenario which is clear for the m - f case ( @xmath60 ) , apparently also emerges for any @xmath9 below @xmath59 , while , of course , it breaks down for sufficiently short - range interactions .",
    "once the bulk flux due to given applied end temperatures is computed , the heat conductivity @xmath3 can be estimated through @xmath65 for small enough difference between the temperatures applied at the ends , @xmath50 . therefore , the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : flux ] for @xmath58 vs @xmath49 ( which were computed for fixed @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) , directly reflect the behavior of the thermal conductivity @xmath3 with @xmath49 and @xmath9 .",
    "we can observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : flux ] that , for fixed size @xmath49 , the scaled flux ( hence @xmath3 ) , continuously increases with @xmath9 . therefore , short range interactions favor heat transport . above @xmath68",
    ", @xmath3 practically attains the level of the n - n dynamics for all @xmath49 .    for fixed @xmath9 ,",
    "when the range is short enough ( @xmath69 ) , we notice that @xmath3 tends to a finite value in the large size limit , indicating the validity of fourier s law .",
    "differently , below @xmath59 , @xmath3 decreases with @xmath49 , apparently following a power - law decay @xmath70 , where @xmath71 for @xmath60 , and the exponent @xmath72 decreases with @xmath9 , vanishing above @xmath59 .",
    "this suggests that @xmath3 becomes null in the tl for systems with @xmath62 .",

    "we show the dependency of @xmath3 with @xmath49 at a low temperature ( @xmath75 ) , for different values of @xmath9 . in all cases , @xmath76 .",

    "[ fig : kappa ] .",
    "let us comment first on the dependency of @xmath3 with @xmath2 for fixed size @xmath49 .",
    "for any @xmath9 , we observe that , the heat conductivity does not depend on @xmath2 at low temperatures , but there is a crossover to a high temperature regime where @xmath3 decays with @xmath2 . in the limit of sufficiently low temperature ,",
    "particles feel the nearly harmonic bottom of the potential well , reaching the limit of harmonic oscillators . at very high temperatures , a decay with @xmath2",
    "is expected , because , the kinetic energy becomes much larger than the potential one ( which is bounded for the @xmath9-xy hamiltonian ) , then , rotors tend to behave as independent particles , and , concomitantly , any transport process tends to become hindered .",
    "next we discuss the impact of @xmath9 on the dependency of @xmath3 with @xmath49 .",
    "let us look at the three leftside panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa ] .",
    "the scenario for any @xmath77 is the same observed for n - n interactions ( @xmath78 ) . at low temperature ,",
    "@xmath3 increases with @xmath49 ( see also the inset , for @xmath75 ) .",
    "the high temperature decay seems to follow a power - law , with the same exponent observed for n - n interactions ( about -3.2  @xcite ) , as illustrated for @xmath73 in fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa ] .",
    "furthermore , at high @xmath2 , the curves for different sizes tend to coincide , consistently with our previous observation of a limiting value of @xmath3 in the large size limit , when we discussed fig .",
    "[ fig : flux ] which was built for @xmath47 .",
    "when the interactions are short - range ( @xmath79 ) , the level of the flat region of @xmath74 , observed for low temperatures below the crossover , grows linearly with @xmath49 ( see inset in the upper left panel ) , as expected for a chain of harmonic oscillators . however ,",
    "notice that , concomitantly with that increase of the flat level with @xmath49 , the crossover temperature diminishes with @xmath49 , suggesting that the curves @xmath74 for different values of @xmath49 tend to adhere to a same curve as @xmath49 increases ( which occurs progressively at lower temperature and larger conductivity ) . if that were the case , the growth of @xmath3 with @xmath49 would persist only at null temperature , but , at a given finite @xmath2 , the conductivity would increase sublinearly with @xmath49 stabilizing at a finite value in the tl .",
    "then , fourier s law would hold .",
    "this possibility is in accord with previous claims  @xcite against the divergence of the conductivity in the tl  @xcite , for n - n interactions , but much higher sizes would be required to confirm the result for any @xmath80 .    at the particular value @xmath81",
    ", we observe that the flat region of the conductivity profile coincides for different values of @xmath49 ( constant @xmath3 in inset plot ) , while for @xmath82 ( illustrated by the case @xmath83 ) , the conductivity decays with system size .",
    "this points that @xmath81 is a marginal case at low temperatures .    at very low temperatures",
    ", a particle feels an harmonic potential , regardless the value of @xmath9 .",
    "however , in the case of long - range interactions , the harmonic approximation does not come solely from n - n interactions",
    ". then the level of the flat region does not increase with @xmath49 , but differently to the harmonic chain behavior , @xmath3 decreases with @xmath49 , becoming presumably vanishingly small in the tl .",
    "now consider the rightside panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa ] ( that is , @xmath84 ) , as well as the inset plot . for temperatures above the crossover ,",
    "a distinctive feature in comparison with the leftside panels appears : the conductivity decays with @xmath49 , suggesting vanishingly small values in the tl ( like in fig .",
    "[ fig : flux ] ) .",
    "therefore , for long - range interactions ( @xmath85 ) , @xmath3 decays with @xmath49 for any @xmath2 , in accord with our discussion for the m - f case where the conductivity vanishes in the limit @xmath86 at any finite temperature .     of the different thermal regimes of the conductivity @xmath3",
    ": conductivity attains a finite value ( f ) or not , either decreasing ( d ) or increasing ( i ) with @xmath49 , for the investigated range of @xmath49 . from plots of @xmath87 vs @xmath49 , like in fig .",
    "[ fig : flux ] , we obtained the classification indicated by characters for each pair ( @xmath2,@xmath9 ) , with @xmath76 .",
    "the arrow highlights the outcomes for @xmath47 , in agreement with the results shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : diagram ] .",
    "we indicate whether , for the studied range of @xmath49 , @xmath3 vs @xmath49 attains a finite value ( f ) or not , and in this latter case whether the behavior is decreasing ( d ) or increasing ( i ) with @xmath49 .",
    "much larger sizes would be required to determine the tl .",
    "this is limited by the computational cost , taking into account that the integration algorithm is of order @xmath89 , and stabilization times also increase with @xmath49 .",
    "moreover , deviations from the diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] may occur for a different ratio @xmath90 , therefore this dependency should be also investigated , but again this is limited by the computational capacity .    although one would expect a priori a threshold at @xmath91 ( where @xmath92 is the lattice dimensionality ) , the curve @xmath88 that emerges from simulations goes from @xmath93 at low temperatures to @xmath94 at high temperatures .",
    "also in this case , a distortion due to finite sizes can not be discarded .",
    "but , coincidentally , the change of regime occurs near the critical temperature ( @xmath95 ) at which the isolated system in equilibrium suffers a ferro - paramagnetic transition when @xmath16 ( a transition also exists for @xmath96 , although at smaller @xmath97 )  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have shown the portrait of heat conduction for a one - dimensional system of interacting particles as a function of the range of the interactions .",
    "the different domains are sketched in the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] . we conclude that , the longer the range of the interactions , more the thermal conduction is spoiled .",
    "an interesting finding is the occurrence of a kind of insulator behavior for @xmath5 ( white region , denoted by ` d ' , in the diagram of fig .  [",
    "fig : diagram ] ) .    for @xmath98 ,",
    "the thermal behavior is analogous to that found for nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "that is , for high temperatures , the thermal conductivity stabilizes at a finite value ( ` f ' ) in the large size limit , decaying with @xmath2 following a power law . for low temperatures ,",
    "the conductivity increases with @xmath49 ( ` i ' ) .",
    "although , for the studied sizes , we do not observe stabilization of @xmath3 at a finite value , a picture similar to that observed for n - n interactions  @xcite emerges , pointing to the validity of fourier s law .",
    "differently , when interaction are sufficiently long - range ( @xmath99 ) , the scaled flux @xmath64 ( hence the conductivity ) decays with @xmath49 for any @xmath2 ( ` d ' ) , apparently vanishing in the tl , like is expected in the limiting mean - field case @xmath60 .",
    "then , the bulk system presents a flat temperature profile and it behaves like an insulator , in the sense that the flux through the chain is vanishingly small .",
    "this poor thermal conductivity is consistent with the slow relaxation to equilibrium observed in long - range systems , like in the hamiltonian mean - field ( @xmath60 )  @xcite or a modified fermi - pasta ulam model  @xcite , where collisional effects act over times that increase with @xmath49 , differently to short - range systems .",
    "the impact on thermal conductivity of other recent results about perturbation propagation , where no finite group velocity limits the spreading of perturbations and supersonic propagation occurs  @xcite in long - range systems , also deserves investigation .",
    "finally , note that it is plausible that the nontrivial scenario here reported for one - dimension can be extended to an arbitrary dimension @xmath100 , for @xmath101 , which might also deserve a future extension of this work ."
