    "we could not find any obvious solution assuming a wind environment .",
    "we have seen in  [ s : promptsed ] that to interpret the prompt optical emission observed by _ swift_/uvot and tarot as originating from the same physical mechanism responsible of the observed emission in x - rays and gamma - rays , we are forced to invoke a non negligible amount of dust .",
    "while invoking dust extinction is not rare in the afterglow spectral analysis , given our ignorance on the physical radiative mechanism at the basis of the prompt emission , the possibility that a distinct phenomenology is mimicked by dust extinction can not be excluded . in particular , for grb 111209a we have seen that at about @xmath39 ks a flare clearly detected with tarot and konus - wind shows an optical peak epoch delayed of about 400 s from the gamma - ray peak . if all the optical emission is delayed with respect to the high energy counterpart , the simultaneous prompt emission sed should take into account such temporal lag .",
    "we test this scenario by simultaneously fitting x - ray spectrum extracted at @xmath72 s with optical spectrum at @xmath73 s , but even in this case , we find that the optical fluxes are severely underestimated and a non - negligible dust extinction may recover the expected values .",
    "another way to mimick a dust extinction effect is the presence of a spectral break between the x - rays and the optical energy domains .",
    "however , we have already considered this case in our heuristic broken power law spectral model , with a break energy in or below the soft x - ray energy range , and we have shown that the much softer optical spectral index can recover the expected harder optical to x - ray spectral slope with the presence of dust extinction .",
    "interestingly , non negligible dust extinction during the prompt emission has already been invoked for another very long grb whose duration falls near the right end of the burst duration distribution , that is , grb 100901a with @xmath74 s @xcite . in that case , to match the optical data with the x - ray extrapolation during the prompt emission where simultaneous optical to gamma - ray spectrum were available , a rest frame visual dust extinction of @xmath75 was introduced @xcite .",
    "in addition , two dark grbs with @xmath76 mag in the rest frame were found to have a very long duration prompt emission , with @xmath77 s , although other long grbs with @xmath78 s were found with no evidence of strong dust extinction @xcite .",
    "however , for grb 111209a , we find that gathering evidence of dust extinction from the afterglow emission is more contrived . the best measure we could perform of any dust reddening in the afterglow emission",
    "was obtained at @xmath79 ks when simultaneous grond and _ swift_/uvot data are available and provide a nir - to - uv sed .",
    "we could not find any evidence of large dust extinction effects since they are well fit by a simple power law model ( @xmath80 with 10 degrees of freedom ) , with a @xmath46 upper limit of @xmath81 mag .",
    "in figure [ figure : sedgrond ] we plot the simultaneous nir / optical and x - ray spectra .",
    "despite the spectral slopes in the two energy regimes are consistent within their uncertainties , there is a clear normalization mismatch .",
    "this is not surprising since at this epoch the x - ray emission is likely still affected by the prompt emission is integrated over the small temporal interval @xmath82 about the grond observation epoch and collected photons provide insufficient statistics to detect the hard component ( see  [ s : xmm ] ) . ] . even neglecting any prompt contribution",
    ", we find that the two spectra can be modelled with a broken power law ( @xmath83 ) , with a 2@xmath84 upper limit of @xmath85 . at @xmath86 ks a simultaneous seds using xmm - newton and uvot data as well as vlt g , r , i and z observations from levan et al .",
    "( 2013 ) were available and again we find similar results , with a rest frame dust extinction of @xmath87 mag .    from the gas column measured using xmm - newton data in the rest frame of the burst",
    ", we find a range of values @xmath88 @xmath18 ( tab.[table : xmm ] ) by assuming a solar abundance and a cold environment .",
    "these values provide an expected dust extincion @xmath89 of the order of @xmath90 mag assuming the average grb @xmath91 for a mw environment ( schady et al .",
    "2010 ) or @xmath92 $ ] mag assuming the empirical @xmath93 observed in our galaxy .",
    "finally , from the radio to x - ray sed extracted at 443 ks after @xmath16 , we find no evidence of dust extinction .",
    "the low dust extinction level inferred from the optical afterglow analysis and the contrasts with the prompt emission findings and with the expected @xmath94 from the xmm - newton data analysis , can be reconciliated by assuming an effective dust destruction mechanism at play during the prompt and the afterglow emission . in this case , the dust inferred during the prompt emission should be located not too distant from the central engine .",
    "dust destruction simulations show that intense grb fluxes can destroy dust up to a radius of @xmath95 pc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , consistent with a dense and dusty star forming region in which the grb is embedded , although the possibility that the dust is produced by the progenitor star itself can not be excluded .",
    "dust destruction is a likely possibility given the intense uv and soft x - ray photon fluxes from a grb and possible evidence of such mechanism has been recently suggested for grb 120119 during the final phases of the prompt emission @xcite , exactly as we propose to be the case for grb 111209a .",
    "the presence of dust in the host galaxy of grb 111209a is in line with the recent findings of a subsolar , but not especially low host galaxy metallicity . from @xmath96 ( levan et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and assuming @xmath97 @xcite , we inferr @xmath98 . at the same time , since for short lived sources such as massive stars the host metallicity likely reflects the star metallicity , this result is at odds with a bsg progenitor interpretation @xcite . indeed , following @xcite , a low metallicity condition of @xmath99 was invoked for this progenitor star ( paper i ) in order to prevent strong wind and thus to provide sufficient mass to supply the central engine over several hours .",
    "a possible solution can be found in a binary system formation channel of the blue supergiant ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "binary systems , either formed by two massive stars or a massive star and a low mass companion @xcite , have been invoked to deal with the increasing evidence that a large fraction of lgrbs explode in high metallicity environments , that is , where the required high core angular momentum condition is expected to be suppressed by strong winds ( see a recent review by e.g. * ? ? ? * and reference therein ) .",
    "a binary system composed by a helium star and a neutron star ( ns ) within a common envelope phase @xcite , has been suggested for grb 101225a , another ultra - long burst ( with bursts duration @xmath100 s ) , that share with grb 111209a similar host galaxy properties @xcite , but for which a clear thermal component was detected in the optical afterglow between 1 and several tens of days after the trigger @xcite , contrary to what we see for grb 111209a .",
    "another interesting scenario suggested by a binary system progenitor for lgrbs , is the  induced gravitational collapse \" ( igc ) of a ns into a black hole ( bh ) through accretion from a massive companion during its supernova ( sn ) phase @xcite .",
    "this scenario could explain a number of lgrbs with burst durations ( @xmath101 ) in the range @xmath102 s , and their afterglow phenomenology @xcite .",
    "the igc model predicts a number of features : a precursor in the prompt emission light curve due to the initial phase of the sn , an optical sn ic signature tens of days after the burst onset and a universal rest frame 0.3 - 10 kev light curve at late times @xcite , possibly due to the newly - born ns after the sn phase of the donor star . whether this model applies to the ultra - long grb 111209a requires accurate modelling .",
    "however , the konus - wind light curve of grb 111209a clearly shows a precursor at about @xmath103 ks .",
    "the detection of a sn for grb 111209a is not obvious from the late time optical light curve , although possible indirect evidence has been discussed by levan et al .",
    "( 2013 ) . finally , by comparing the sample of igc - grbs at known redshift @xcite with grb 111209a , we find that the late x - ray afterglow luminosity of grb 111209a shows a consistent behavior starting from about @xmath104 ks in the rest frame ( fig.[f : igc ] ) .",
    "following @xcite , we further make a blind search of the redshift by comparing the expected grb 111209a x - ray luminosities it the burst were at redshift @xmath1050.4,0.5,0.6,0.7 and 0.8 , with the prototype light curve of grb 090618 , and we find that residuals are minimized for a redshift between 0.6 and 0.7 , consistent with the spectroscopic redshift of z=0.677 of grb 111209a .",
    "though optical flare lags have been already observed in other lgrbs , the lag measured for grb 111209a of @xmath106 s in the rest frame is far more larger than what was reported earlier .",
    "for example , for grb 081126 at redshift @xmath107 and with burst duration of @xmath108 s , a temporal lag of ( @xmath109 ) s was measured for a prompt emission flare @xcite . for xrf 071031 at @xmath110 and with @xmath111",
    "s an optical flare lag was measured to be 35 seconds in the burst frame @xcite .",
    "no temporal lag was found for a simultaneous prompt emission optical and gamma - ray flare detected in two very long grb 110205a at @xmath112 @xcite and grb 100901a at @xmath113 @xcite , with @xmath114 s and @xmath115 s respectively .",
    "a 2 s delay was observed between the gamma - ray and optical variable emission during the prompt emission of the very bright ,  naked eye \" burst grb 080319b at z=0.937 with @xmath116s ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "all these temporal lags range below @xmath117 seconds in the burst rest frame and there is no obvious connection with the burst duration that would explain the much longer delay of the ultra - long grb 111209a .    in general , flares observed in x - rays and gamma - rays are known to show faster rising , faster decaying profile , and earlier peak at high energies than at low energies due to a hard - to - soft spectral evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the optical lags observed in some grbs may be an extension of this property in the optical energy domain .",
    "the large diversity on the optical temporal gaps observed among several lgrbs may be due to different dynamics of the synchrotron frequencies crossing the two energy domains ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the framework of the internal shock model ,",
    "another possible explanation of the optical temporal lag predicts that the optical counterpart of the gamma - ray flare is generated by synchrotron mechanism in a different , optically thin region of the ejecta , more distant from the inner , optically thick regions where gamma rays are generated . to reproduce two distinct emitting regions ,",
    "one possible scenario is based on the assumption of a large neutron ejecta component : delayed flare optical counterpart can originate in the catching up of a late ejected proton shell with an earlier ejected neutron shell that has travelled far away from the central engine with negligible interactions with the ejecta , where electrons are produced through neutron @xmath118-decay @xcite .",
    "the predicted time delay between the optical and gamma - ray peaks is expected to be of the order of 2 - 3 seconds for @xmath119 ( from @xmath120 s , fan et al .",
    "2009 ) , thus it can reproduce the large temporal lag observed for grb 111209a only for a lorentz factor of the neutron shell of a few . in an alternative scenario , a delayed optical emission can originate from  residual \" collisions at larger distance @xmath121 from the central engine @xcite .",
    "temporal delay of the order of a fraction of seconds is obtained for fiducial values of @xmath122 cm and @xmath123 from @xmath124 .",
    "large time delays as those observed in grb 111209a , for which @xmath125 cm , could thus be achieved assuming low @xmath126 values or large radii .",
    "in  [ s : xmm ] the temporally resolved spectral analysis of the xmm - newton data suggest the presence of two spectral components at the end of the steep decay phase , where the hardest one dominates at high energies ( see @xmath127 and @xmath128 in tab.[table : xmm ] and fig.[f : xmm ] ) .",
    "an intriguing explanation of the hard spectral component in the xmm - newton spectra can be found following the recent gamma - ray instruments findings in the grb observational campaigns .",
    "some bursts observed by fermi in the large area telescope ( lat ) energy range ( 20 mev - 300 gev ) , as for instance grb 090902b @xcite , show the presence of a very hard power law spectral component in addition to the typical prompt emission spectrum that is usually fitted by a band law or a cut - off power law .",
    "the power law extra - component is present during the prompt phase and it decays once the afterglow has started ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is very hard ( e.g. an energy spectral index of @xmath129 for grb 090510 , @xcite ) .",
    "one may thus consider the extra - component seen in grb 111209a as the  soft tail \" of this hard power law seen by the fermi / lat .",
    "the fact that we detect it only at the end of the steep decay phase is linked to its properties : the hard power law component intensity rises slowly during the prompt phase and it is typically detected when the x - ray prompt emission has just ended . at that point",
    "it decays following a power law ( see e.g. zhang et al .",
    "2011 for a review ) . in our case ,",
    "the soft tail of this component is too faint to be detected during the prompt emission while it emerges when the main x - ray prompt spectral continuum drops down to small flux levels at the end of the steep decay phase . by roughly modelling the temporal evolution of the hard component ( see @xmath130 values in the temporal bins a , b and c in table [ table : xmm ] ) with a power law decay , we could roughly measure a decay index of @xmath131 that , despite the large uncertainties , is consistent with past measures ( e.g. @xmath132 in the case of grb 090902b , @xmath4 for grb 090510 , see ackermann et al .",
    "2013 ) and it may be steeper than the afterglow decay that , at that epoch , is entering in the shallow decay phase thus preventing further detections at later times of the hard component .",
    "ironically , one of the two grbs for which the prompt extra spectral component has been unambiguously detected ( grb 090902b and grb 090510 ) is a short grb , that is , at the opposite end of the burst duration distribution range than the ultra - long grb 111209a .",

    "although we detect a thermal emission for grb 111209a , it was in the soft x - ray energy range and not simultaneous to the power law extra - component .",

    "swift_/uvot data , we measure a spectral index of @xmath135 (  [ s : opt ] ) . in the following ,",
    "we explore three possible scenarios of this early emission .    _",
    "forward shock .",
    "_ according to the synchrotron closure relationships between the temporal and spectral indices , the expected spectral slope during this phase is @xmath136 or @xmath137 for @xmath138 or @xmath139 , respectively where @xmath55 is the synchrotron cooling frequency and @xmath65 is the frequency at which the bulk of the electrons are radiating @xcite .",
    "the measured spectral index @xmath140 is thus consistent within the uncertainties with the case @xmath141 .",
    "alternatively , the case @xmath142 may also be valid assuming a certain amount of dust extinction and @xmath143 @xcite ] .    if fs is the correct interpretation , the bump at @xmath144 ks marks the fireball deceleration epoch . assuming a constant density environment in the range @xmath145 @xmath67 and an energy conversion efficiency of @xmath146",
    ", we find @xmath147 of the order of @xmath148 and a deceleration radius of @xmath149 cm by simply equating the fireball energy with the swept - up mass energy assuming a spherical geometry @xcite .",
    "the lack of evidence of a further steepening of the light curve before @xmath117 ks , that is before the epoch when the rebrightening phase starts to dominate , imposes a lower limit to the jet opening angle . assuming a range of density values between 0.01 and 1 @xmath67",
    ", we estimate that the jet half opening angle should be larger than @xmath1501 - 4 degrees day after the trigger may indicate , among several scenarios , an energy injection or the emergence of an additional jet component . therefore assuming the initial kinetic energy and the lower limit on the jet break time to estimate the jet opening angle of grb 111209a may be an oversimplification . ]    _ reverse shock . _",
    "an alternative interpretation of the early optical decay can be found in the reverse shock ( rs ) , formed in the fireball impact with the surrounding medium .",
    "indeed , rs emission is expected to produce early optical  flashes \" peaking at epochs comparable to the burst duration @xcite .",
    "this may be the case for the early optical emission of grb 111209a , the decaying behavior of which starts roughly at the estimated end of the prompt emission , as expected . given the ultra - long duration of the burst , it is likely that the so called  thick shell \" case applies for grb 111209a . in the  thick shell \" case ,",
    "the reverse shock has enough time to accelerate to relativistic velocities whithin the shell .",
    "the expected spectral behavior of the reverse shock follows the synchrotron emission prescriptions , as for the forward shock case . according to @xcite , for @xmath142",
    ", a flux decay is expected to have a power law index of @xmath151 , thus consistent with the measured decay index @xmath152 ( tab.[tab : otlc ] ) for an electron ( power - law ) energy distribution index of @xmath153 .",
    "we note that from the late afterglow radio - to - x - ray sed we inferr a higher value of @xmath154 ( see  [ s : radiosed ] ) , thus if the rs is the correct interpretation , these results possibly indicate an evolution of the microphysical parameters between the early and the late afterglow phases .    for @xmath141 ,",
    "the rs emission rises to a constant flux phase up to the end of the prompt duration and then it vanishes since no electrons are shocked after the rs has crossed the shell .",
    "thus , if @xmath141 , the rs scenario can not explain the observed smooth flux decay .",
    "_ internal shock . _ another possible interpretation associates the steep optical decay to the high latitude emission from the internal shocks emission ( is ) formed whithin the ejecta and responsible also of the x - ray and gamma - ray emission .",
    "however , in this case , the predicted decay rate is @xmath155 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , that is much steeper than the measured one , so we can exclude this scenario .",
    "in addition , the radius where is takes place is typically smaller than the external shock ; this makes unlikely an is decay time scale of order of several tens of kiloseconds ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "now we turn to interpret the re - brightening observed at @xmath38 ks . before the re - brightening peak ,",
    "the estimated mean rising index is @xmath156 ( tab.[tab : otlc ] ) while the spectral index is @xmath157 up to the re - brightening peak epoch ( measured from nir and optical data ,  [ s : opt ] ) .",
    "the x - ray plateau is observed nearly simultaneously with the optical re - brightening .",
    "several hypothesis have been made to interpret the late re - brightening observed in many lgrbs .",
    "_ structured jet model . _",
    "a re - brightening feature can be reproduced by a two jet component scenario .",
    "one possible configuration predicts that the prompt and the early afterglow emission are produced by a fast , narrow jet while the late re - brightening is due to the deceleration process of a wide , slower jet , that may dominate the emission from the other jet at late times ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we have already seen that the early optical afterglow emission of grb 111209a can be interpreted in the context of the fs emission , thus , in this scenario , with the fs formed in the impact between the narrow jet with the ism . however , if the rebrightening were produced by the fs of the wider jet , according to the fs modeling @xcite , we would expect a slower rising index and a much harder spectrum than what we measure during the rising phase .",
    "in addition we do not find marked evidence of spectral evolution near the peak epoch as expected from the crossing of the injection synchrotron frequency .",
    "an alternative scenario assumes that the two jets have different axis orientation with respect to the line of sight of the observer , where the off - axis one originates the rebrightening as an effect of the jet approaching the line of sight ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this scenario",
    "a large variety of rising behaviours can be reproduced , depending on the angle formed between the line of sight and the jet axis . in this case , in order to dominate the on - axis jet emission at late times , the off - axis jet component should be more energetic . for grb 111209a , for which @xmath158 erg ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , the latter condition makes this scenario less favourable , although it can not be excluded . _ late prompt model . _ a large range of possible rebrightening morphologies can be reproduced also by the so called  late prompt model \" ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this model ,",
    "the re - brightening feature is the emerging of the prolonged central engine emission from the decaying afterglow signal .",
    "this model predicts a strong spectral evolution during the rebrightening that is however not so evident for grb 111209a ( fig.[f : otlc ] ) .",
    "_ density gradient .",
    "_ one possibility invokes a density gradient in the circumburst environment if the condition @xmath159 is satisfied ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "since the first studies on this hypothesis , the vast phenomenology observed so far have shown that additional requirements should be included in the density gradient scenario in order to reproduce the observations . in particular , @xcite were able to reproduce a large variety of late re - brightening morphologies by allowing the shock microphysics parameters to vary between an initial wind environment and the following shocked constant density environment .",
    "_ delayed energy injection .",
    "_ another possible interpretation of the late re - brightening is associated with a late energy injection given by the delayed interaction of slow ejected shells with the fireball ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this model has been frequently invoked to explain the x - ray shallow phase observed in a large fraction of x - ray afterglows soon after the steep decay phase .",
    "energy injection models do not predict any spectral variability and indeed during the plateau in x - rays of grb 111209a , we could detect the presence of a spectral component with nearly constant spectral slope @xmath160 ( tab.[table : xmm ] ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the late optical rebrightening is simply the optical counterpart of the x - ray emission , unless assuming that it is by chance simultaneous with the x - ray plateau .",
    "we have analyzed the extensive multi - wavelength data set of the  ultra - long \" grb 111209a from the prompt emission to the late afterglow . during the prompt emission , at 2 ks from @xmath16 we measure an unprecedented large temporal lag of @xmath106 s in the burst rest frame between the optical and the high energy peak time of a pronounced flare .",
    "this lag may be the evidence of two distinct emission regions for the gamma - rays and optical observed radiation , although other scenarios can not be excluded .",
    "separate emission regions may be also supported by the evidence of an extra hard power law component in the x - ray spectrum at the end of the prompt emission if interpreted as the soft tail of the hard power - law component observed in few cases by gamma - ray instruments at the prompt - to - afterglow transition phase ( e.g. zhang et al . 2011 ) .    assuming a common origin of the optical and the high energy prompt photons , a non negligible amount of dust extinction should be invoked , in analogy with other very long grbs for which simultaneous optical to gamma - ray prompt emission data were available ( e.g. grb 100901a @xcite ) and with two very dark grbs with prompt duration of about 800s @xcite .",
    "the afterglow data analysis , however , does not confirm the presence of dust , possibly indicating that the intense uv and x - ray flux from the grb have partially destroyed the dust along the line of sight in the host galaxy .",
    "the presence of dust is consistent with the findings of a subsolar but not exceptionally low metallicity in the host galaxy of grb 111209a and is at odds with the very low metallicity envirnoment invoked for a blue supergiant progenitor in our paper i. a possible solution can be found by invoking a binary system formation channel of the blue supergiant , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "the evolution of a binary system of two massive stars or a massive star and a small mass companion has often been invoked for lgrbs to confront the increasing evidence of a significant fraction of lgrbs in high metal - content host galaxies ( see e.g. levesque 2013 for a recent review ) .",
    "in addition , binary systems are at the basis of the igc model that provides a unified view of the phenomenology observed in both the prompt and the afterglow observed in some lgrbs @xcite .    despite the exceptional longevity of grb 111209a ,",
    "its afterglow is not dissimilar from other normally long grbs in terms of optical and x - ray afterglow light curves and spectra .",
    "indeed , the prompt to afterglow transition in both x - rays and optical wavelengths does not differ from several other lgrbs studied in the past , showing an initial flux decay with different decay indices in the two energy ranges and followed by an optical re - brightening nearly simultaneous to an x - ray plateau .",
    "the spectral and temporal information available during the early optical afterglow decay prevent us to disentangle among a forward shock or a reverse shock origin , while enable to exclude an internal shock origin . in the fs case , a lorentz factor of @xmath148 and a deceleration radius of @xmath161 cm",
    "are inferred .",
    "the late afterglow tentatively favours the presence of a prolonged energy injection from the central engine that , if true , should be active up to 70 - 80 ks after the trigger , that is , for a dozen of hours in the rest frame .",
    "however , the late rebrightening can be explained also through a density gradient , as expected in the likely complex environment surrounding the progenitor of grb 111209a , or by a structured jet scenario .",
    "the radio to x - ray broad band sed at 5 days after the trigger is consistent with the synchrotron model for a fireball expanding in an ism with density @xmath162 @xmath67 and a predicted large half opening angle of the jet ( @xmath163 degrees ) .",
    "finally , we note that the existence of a bright optical emission associated with an ultra - long grb with flux level above 0.1 - 1 mjy up to several hours after the trigger may increase the orphan afterglow detection probability , a still unsolved fundamental issue that would definitively provide access to the jetted nature of these events ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
