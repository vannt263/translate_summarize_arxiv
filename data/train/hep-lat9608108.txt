    "a quantitative theoretical understanding of the @xmath0 rule in @xmath2 decays has proven to be a formidable task since the calculation of hadronic matrix elements in the low - energy non - perturbative regime is needed . in the continuum , with an active charm quark and the gim mechanism at work , the operator basis given by @xmath3    -(u\\to c ) .",

    "in fact , the wilson term induces the mixing of @xmath4 with lower - dimensional operators , with power - divergent coefficients , which need to be subtracted non - perturbatively .",
    "non - perturbative ( np ) renormalization has witnessed a great progress recently @xcite . in this talk",
    ", we want to outline the strategy for the renormalization of the lattice operators @xmath4 using the np method ( npm ) of @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we shall concentrate only on the octet component of @xmath4 , which we will denote with @xmath5 @xcite , will be neglected in the following . ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : d=6 ] we also reconsider the mixing with dimension - six operators @xcite and its implications on the chiral behaviour of @xmath1 @xcite , a problem also addressed in @xcite using the ward identities ( wi ) .",
    "we stress that the npm of @xcite and the wi are completely equivalent , provided the renormalization scale is large enough , since the renormalized operators with the good chiral properties are unique .",
    "anyway , the npm of @xcite must be used to calculate the overall costant , which the wi can not determine .",
    "on the lattice , the general prescription to restore the chiral symmetry broken by the wilson term is to subtract all the operators of dimension equal or less than @xmath5 .",
    "the operators which need to be subtracted are dictated by the symmetries of the action : charge conjugation ( c ) , parity ( p ) and @xmath6 flavour switching symmmetry ( s ) @xcite .",
    "there are different ways of calculating the @xmath2 matrix elements , which correspond to different renormalization structures @xcite .",
    "we considering here a general structure of the form @xmath7 \\label{eq : hatopm}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 are the bare operators , @xmath8 are dimension - six operators of wrong chirality ( cf .",
    "[ sec : d=6 ] ) , @xmath9 is a dimension - five of the form @xmath10 ( @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 is a dimension - three operator of the form @xmath14 ( @xmath15 or @xmath16 ) . according to the npm ,",
    "the mixing @xmath17 s are determined by finding a set of projectors on the tree - level amputated green functions ( gf ) , with off - shell quark and gluon external states , the choice of which depends on the nature of the operators at hand . for the @xmath0 operators we choose the following set of external states : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , with the momenta given below in eq .",
    "( [ eq:6-z - system ] ) . for each choice of external states , i.e. for each different set of gf ,",
    "we need different type of projectors .",
    "let us denote with @xmath21 the projector on the @xmath18 gf of the operator @xmath13 , with @xmath22 the projector on the @xmath19 gf of the operator @xmath9 , and with @xmath23 the set of mutually orthogonal projectors on the operators @xmath24 @xcite . applying the projectors to the corresponding np gf of the renormalized operators @xmath25 , with an appropriate choice of the external states , we require that the renormalized operators be proportional to the bare operators , @xmath26 ( up to terms of @xmath27 ) , i.e.  we impose the following renormalization conditions ( trace over colour and spin is understood in the projection operation ) : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the momentum of the external quark and gluon legs .",
    "the system of equations ( [ eq:6-z - system ] ) completely determines in a np way the renormalization constants , as we have six conditions ( non - homogeneous due to the matrix elements of @xmath5 , cf .",
    "( [ eq : hatopm ] ) ) in six unknown mixing constants , @xmath31 .",
    "unfortunately , since solving eq .",
    "( [ eq:6-z - system ] ) involves delicate cancellations between large contributions , it may very likely result in a very noisy determination , even with large statistics . an equivalent strategy we can adopt",
    "is : + 1 .",
    "we introduce an intermediate subtraction for the dimension - five and -six operators @xmath32 and determine the power - divergent mixing constants @xmath33 and @xmath34 by imposing @xmath35 2 .",
    "the finite mixing constants @xmath36 and @xmath37 , which in principle can be calculated in perturbation theory ( pt ) , are then determined from the system @xmath38",
    "in ref .  @xcite the np mixing with equal dimensional operators of the @xmath39 operator , which has the same lorentz structure of @xmath40 , has been studied , with the mixing limited to a basis of three operators , denoted here with @xmath41 , found by an explicit 1-loop calculation @xcite . a more careful analysis based on cps@xcite",
    "has shown that beyond 1-loop , the operators @xmath5 are allowed to mix not only with @xmath42 , present in 1-loop pt , but also with @xmath43 , \\label{eq : o_4}\\ ] ] which is not present at the 1-loop level , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the operators @xmath46 are fierz eigenstates in dirac - colour space with eigenvalue @xmath47 , respectively @xcite .",
    "we stress that fierz transformations are not a symmetry of the action , but only of the operators , thus they can not determine the operator mixing .",
    "nevertheless , since fierz transformations have been used in the perturbative calculations @xcite , we have also used them to classify and reorganize the np mixing .",
    "we have extended the method for the renormalization of the @xmath39 operator presented in ref .",
    "@xcite including the fourth operator @xmath48 , and have determined the mixing constants @xmath49 , and the overall constant @xmath50 .",
    "we have performed the calculation using the same parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite , on a @xmath51 lattice , at @xmath52 , with a hopping parameter @xmath53 for the sw - clover quark propagator , in the lattice landau gauge , but with higher statistics , i.e.   on an ensemble of 200 configurations .",
    "we have calculated the @xmath17 s at different renormalization scales @xmath54 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : zi ] ) .",
    "we note that @xmath55 and @xmath56 are very well defined and almost scale - independent in a large `` window '' of @xmath54 , whereas @xmath57 and @xmath58 present a smaller window , i.e.  a more pronounced scale - dependence .",
    "moreover , @xmath56 which is absent in 1-loop pt , is not negligible .",
    "we stress that the large fluctuations at small @xmath54 do not spoil the validity of the npm , since in that region the perturbative matching to a continuum scheme is not reliable , as for any np lattice method @xcite .    using the np @xmath17 s of fig .",
    "[ fig : zi ] , the chiral behaviour of the @xmath1 parameter studied in refs .",
    "@xcite can be revisited .",
    "since the mixing with @xmath48 starts at @xmath59 we do not expect drastic changes in the chiral behaviour .",
    "if the chiral behaviour were sensibly different , we would not trust the matching to the continuum which has an uneludable perturbative uncertainty . in fig .",
    "[ fig : chiral ] the result using the np @xmath17 s at @xmath60 is shown .",
    "we will concentrate here on the novelties introduced by the np mixing with the complete basis ( @xmath61 ) with respect to the basis found in 1-loop pt ( @xmath62 ) @xcite , refering to @xcite for a detailed analysis . using the usual parametrization @xmath63",
    ", we have found that the use of the complete set of operators leaves the values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 almost unchanged compared to the @xmath62 case , whereas the value of @xmath66 is slightly lowered , passing from @xmath67 to @xmath68 .",
    "we note that the two values of @xmath66 are compatible with each other and with zero . within the current statistical limitations forced by the thinning approximation @xcite",
    ", we can only state that the value of @xmath1 , proportional to @xmath65 , is unaltered , while the correct chiral behaviour of the continuum , signaled by the vanishing of @xmath66 , is recovered .",
    "these results are independent of the scale @xmath69 used , albeit not too small .",
    "we argue that this stability is due to the extremely clean determination of @xmath55 @xcite .",
