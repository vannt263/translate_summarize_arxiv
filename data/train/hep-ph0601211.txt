    "recently a new charmed - strange meson , @xmath4 , has been discovered by the babar collaboration @xcite .",
    "it was confirmed by the cleo collaboration @xcite .",
    "the cleo reported another charmed - strange meson called @xmath2 .",
    "finally , these mesons were confirmed by the belle collaboration @xcite .",
    "the masses and decay properties of @xmath4 and @xmath2 have been investigated with particular structures assumed for them .",
    "essentially there are two types of structures assumed .",
    "the one is ordinary @xmath5 structure and the other an exotic structure such as @xmath6 molecule @xcite or tetra - quark configuration @xcite .",
    "we work with the former structure in this paper .",
    "then , these new entries together with @xmath1 and @xmath7 which were discovered earlier are expected to form a quartet with @xmath0 ( @xmath8-states ) of the @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 ) system . in this expectation ,",
    "godfrey studied various properties of @xmath4 and @xmath2 @xcite , following the works prior to the discoveries of these mesons @xcite . also decay modes of @xmath4 and @xmath2 were analyzed by colangero and de fazio @xcite , bardeen et al .",
    "@xcite , mehen and springer @xcite and close and swanson @xcite .    with respect to the spin - structure of these mesons , there are four states , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , in terms of the @xmath15 bases . while @xmath4 and @xmath7 can probably be assigned to @xmath12 and @xmath14 , respectively , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are probably mixtures of @xmath11 and @xmath13 .",
    "the extent of the mixing can be parameterized by a mixing angle @xcite .",
    "in addition to the masses of the mesons , the branching fractions for @xmath16 followed by the electromagnetic ( em ) decays of @xmath17 have also been measured @xcite .",
    "the mixing angle are closely related to the em decay rates of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine the spin - structure of the four mesons .",
    "we use the constituent quark model with the interquark interactions that arise from the nonrelativistic expansion of the qcd inspired fermi - breit interaction .",
    "we have five types of interactions in the following sense .",
    "in addition to the spin - independent interaction that consists of a confining potential and the color coulomb interaction , we have four types of spin - dependent interactions .",
    "they are the spin - spin , tensor and two types of spin - orbit interactions on which we elaborate in the next paragraph .",
    "the model is the same as the one used by godfrey _",
    "@xcite except that we do not assume any explicit forms for the interactions as functions of the distance between the two quarks .",
    "we treat all spin - dependent interactions perturbatively .    by the two types of the spin - orbit interactions we mean the ones that are respectively symmetric and antisymmetric with respect to the interchange of the two quarks .",
    "we refer to the former as sls and the latter as asls interactions .",
    "the sls interaction commutes with the total spin of the two quarks whereas asls interaction does not .",
    "the asls interaction violates the conservation of the total spin .",
    "this is the agent that induces the mixing of @xmath11 and @xmath13 .",
    "the asls interaction is proportional to the mass difference between the quarks .",
    "hence its effect can be substantial when the mass difference is large , leading to a specific amount of mixing in the heavy quark limit .",
    "this is indeed the case with the @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 ) system as we will see .",
    "historically effects of asls interaction were first examined for the @xmath18 interaction and hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "regarding the particular role of the spin - orbit interactions in @xmath5 systems , we refer to a series of works by schnitzer @xcite and the work by cahn and jackson @xcite in addition to those quoted already @xcite . as we said above",
    "we have five types of interactions . on the other hand there are five pieces of experimental data now available , which are the masses of the four mesons and the branching ratio of the em decays .",
    "the matrix elements of the five interactions ( within the @xmath8-state sector ) can be determined such that the five pieces of the experimental data be reproduced . at the same time",
    "the spin structure of the four mesons can be determined . in doing",
    "so we do not have to know the radial dependence of the interactions . as it turns out the spin - spin interaction , among the four types of the spin - dependent interactions ,",
    "plays a particularly interesting role in relation to the spin structure of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we begin sec .",
    "ii by defining a nonrelativistic model hamiltonian which incorporates relativistic corrections as various spin - dependent interactions and proceed to determining the matrix elements of the interactions by using the mass spectra of the @xmath0 quartet of charmed - strange mesons and the em decay widths of @xmath2 . in sec .",
    "iii we make remarks on the approximations that we use . discussions and a summary are given in the last section .",
    "in table i we list the observed charmed - strange mesons that we consider in this paper @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we give remarks on the approximations that we have used in sec .",
    "first , we have regarded all spin - dependent interactions as perturbation and obtained their matrix elements as given in eqs.([evvs])-([evdelta ] ) .",
    "a typical mass difference @xmath19 between two consecutive principal states that emerges from @xmath20 is probably like @xmath21mev to @xmath22mev .",
    "the values of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are much smaller than @xmath19 .",
    "this justifies our perturbative treatment of the spin - dependent interactions .",
    "secondly , we have ignored the tensor coupling of @xmath14 state to @xmath27 state .",
    "the nonvanishing matrix element of the tensor interaction between these states gives rise to an additive correction to @xmath28 in eq.([matrix_element_of_h ] ) through the second order perturbation .",
    "let us have an estimate of the second order correction .",
    "note that a quark in a state with @xmath29 feels the color coulomb interaction much less than a quark in an @xmath30 state .",
    "this is because the wave function of the former is much suppressed near the origin as compared with the wave function of the latter .",
    "therefore , the @xmath8- and @xmath31-state wave functions are not very different from those emerging from the confinement potential alone .",
    "let us ignore the color coulomb interaction in obtaining the @xmath8- and @xmath31-state wave functions and use the harmonic oscillator potential for @xmath32",
    ". then the radial parts of nodeless @xmath8- and @xmath31-state wave functions are given by @xmath33^{1/4}r\\ :   { \\rm e}^{-\\mu\\omega r^2/2 } \\\\",
    "\\label{f_state } r_3(r)&=&\\sqrt{\\frac{32}{105}}\\left[\\frac{(\\mu\\omega)^9}{\\pi}\\right]^{1/4}r^3\\ : { \\rm e}^{-\\mu\\omega r^2/2 } \\quad , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is an oscillator constant and @xmath35 the reduced mass .",
    "remember that @xmath34 is related to the mass difference between two consecutive principal states and , hence , @xmath36 . since the tensor interaction can be expressed as @xmath37 in terms of the color coulomb interaction , the needed diagonal and off - diagonal matrix elements are given by @xmath38 where we have used @xmath39 with the strong coupling constant @xmath40 .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath41 if we equate the denominator to the matrix element of the tensor operator times the quantity given in eq.([evvt ] ) , that is , @xmath42 an approximate magnitude of the off - diagonal element becomes @xmath43 since the energy difference between the @xmath14 and @xmath27 states is approximately @xmath44gev , the second order correction will be about @xmath45mev , that is , about 5% of the diagonal element for the @xmath14 state .",
    "thus we conclude that the tensor coupling to @xmath27 state will not change our result appreciably .",
    "we have examined the @xmath8-state charmed - strange mesons , focusing on the mixing of @xmath11 and @xmath13 states in @xmath1 and @xmath2 that is caused by the antisymmetric spin - orbit ( asls ) interaction .",
    "we have treated the spin - dependent interactions that arise from the nonrelativistic expansion of the fermi - breit interaction perturbatively .",
    "we have not assumed any explicit forms for the interactions as functions of the interquark distance .",
    "we have expressed the matrix elements of these interactions in terms of the observed masses of the @xmath8-state quartet and the mixing angle determined from the em decay rates of @xmath2 .",
    "the em decay rates have large statistical errors .",
    "if we vary the decay rates within the errors , the mixing angle varies widely .",
    "the matrix elements of the spin - dependent interactions also vary accordingly .",
    "the matrix elements of the sls , tensor and asls interactions are relatively stable with the variation of the mixing angle , varying only within 20% . on the other hand",
    ", the matrix element of the spin - spin interaction varies from @xmath46mev to @xmath47mev when the mixing angle varies from one end to the other determined from the em decay rates with the statistical errors .",
    "note that godfrey and kokoski obtained the matrix element of the spin - spin interaction @xmath48mev that lies in this interval @xcite .",
    "the matrix element of the spin - spin interaction is particularly sensitive to the mixing angle and of crucial importance in determining the dominant states of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . with the large variation of the mixing angle",
    ", the dominant state of @xmath1 is transferred from @xmath13 to @xmath11 state and that of @xmath2 from @xmath11 to @xmath13 state .",
    "this implies that the spin - spin interaction is the most important among the spin - dependent interactions for the determination of the dominant states in @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    ". it will be crucial for their assignments , provided other mechanisms for the mixing such as the coupling to decay channels are less significant than what we have discussed @xcite .",
    "our analysis is based on the branching fractions that were obtained from the first observation of @xmath16 decays by the belle collaboration .",
    "the analyses are accompanied by large statistical errors , and so be the mixing angle that is extracted from the branching fractions . for further discussion of the relationship between the mixing angle and the spin - dependent interactions , we need more refined data of the branching fractions by the experimental groups",
    ".    we are grateful to yuki nogami for helpful comments on the manuscript .",
    "a. s. would like to thank professor t. udagawa for the warm hospitality extended to him at the university of texas at austin where the last part of this work was done .",
