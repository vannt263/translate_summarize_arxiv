    "nowadays there are recognized computational methods to numerically simulate material interfaces or moving free boundaries . among the well - known approaches ,",
    "let us mention the levelset approach pioneered by osher - sethian @xcite , the family of interface reconstructions ( ir ) algorithms @xcite that can be more or less sophisticated ( moments - of - fluid approaches  @xcite being the most sophisticated ) , and diffuse interface capturing ( ic ) methods @xcite .",
    "each of these methods both show advantages and drawback , and thus are more or less suitable for different problems according to the kind of application , the expected properties and the quantities of interest to compute . for example , if conservation properties are mandatory , levelset methods are not the right candidate family : even if today we find volume conservative levelset methods , mass conservation may not be strictly fulfilled , what can be not accurate enough for some highly compressible flows or flows with high ratios of density .",
    "after decades of sustained developments and research in this fields , interface capturing ( ic ) methods are still an active field of investigation ( see the recent references  @xcite ) . they can show advantages like a natural extension to an arbitrary number of fluids , phases of materials , the possibility to deal with complex topologies and configurations ( triple points , ... ) in a rather easy way , the simplicity of code development , debugging and optimization .",
    "there is also another feature not to forget : the compute performance of the methods , especially for multicore or manycore parallel computer architectures that appear to be the current and future driving hardware trend .",

    ". key factors of performance are typically a well - balanced operational intensity , data coalescence in memory , cache blocking , processor occupancy and simd feature of the algorithms @xcite .",
    "we advocate the idea that today a good computational approach is a good trade - off between numerical analysis requirements ( like order of accuracy and stability ) , generalization / flexibility property and fast or practical implementation features .",
    "our experience in computational methods , performance evaluation and performance modeling @xcite make us believe that interface capturing schemes are good candidates for these performance issues , ready to fulfil most of these performance factors .    as a summary",
    ", we look for interface capturing methods that share the following properties :    * numerical stability and low - diffusive aspect ; * simd - type algorithms ; * simple coding and debugging ; * relatively easy extension to an arbitrary number of materials ; * relatively easy extension to three - dimensional problems ; * natural extension to unstructured meshes ; * relatively simple prediction of computing performance .",
    "this paper more focuses on stability , low - diffusive feature and accuracy of interface capturing methods , but we keep in mind all the above requirements . the paper is organized as follows . in section  2 , we will test standard muscl slope limiter - based finite volume schemes for interface capturing and will show a set of artefacts and instabilities by numerical evidence . in section 3 , we will provide some elements of analysis about these artefacts .",

    ", there is a loss of accuracy in this case .",
    "of course the analysis of the determination of the order of accuracy is quite hard to achieve because the loss of accuracy of course occurs at locations where the solution is exactly non - smooth ( actually discontinuous ) . in any event ,",
    "let us try to find some expected consistency or accuracy conditions in particular cases .        in the discrete advection problem ,",
    "we have privileged directions ( see figure  [ fig : geo ] ) : first the unit vector  @xmath19 which is normal to the edge  @xmath18 , then the direction of advection ( given by  @xmath2 ) and the gradient  @xmath95 .",

    "then @xmath7 is solution of @xmath98 , or @xmath99 in conservative form . if a stationary interface exists , then it is parallel to the line of velocity directions .",
    "let us see what happen at the discrete level .",
    "recall the discrete divergence operator @xmath100 for a uniform velocity field @xmath2 , this reduces to @xmath101 in the above expression we recognize a discrete gradient operator for @xmath7  : @xmath102 assume that locally we have the linear reconstruction @xmath103 putting   into   gives us @xmath104 from the geometrical property @xmath105 we get @xmath106 by applying green s formula , it is easy to check that @xmath107 so that we find @xmath108 the question is to know whether @xmath109 is close to zero or not .",
    "of course , it depends on how  @xmath110 is computed , and in particular it depends on the choice of slope limiters .",
    "we have the following consistency results :    1 .   if @xmath111 , then we have @xmath112 exactly , without error ; 2 .   if @xmath113 then we have a first - order consistent formula ; 3 .",
    "if for some reason , there exists a constant @xmath114 which is independent of @xmath33 , such that @xmath115 , we have a @xmath116-order consistency .",
    "we claim that case 3 ) is exactly what occurs when direction - by - direction one - dimensional compressive slope limiters are used . in fact , one - dimensional slope limiters are used to limit the amplitude of gradients not to create new extrema and reproduce a derivative for smooth solutions , but may produce incorrect gradient directions in the multidimensional case and for non - smooth solutions .",
    "in fact , reality is a little bit more tricky because reconstructed muscl upwind schemes also take into account the direction of advection by some upwind process .",
    "let us consider the example given into figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "let us still consider a uniform velocity field @xmath117 and a continuous stationary interface aligned with @xmath2 . to derive a discrete solution , we project the continuous solution on piecewise constant solutions as suggested by the finite volume theory .",
    "one finds `` mixed '' cells with values either @xmath92 or @xmath93 that represent the interface at the discrete level .",
    "let us assume the use of direction - by - direction slope limiter of type superbee ( or ultrabee that would return the same result ) .",
    "the evaluation of the discrete divergence @xmath118 involves a 9-point cross - shaped stencil as drawn in figure  [ fig:2 ] . on figure [ fig:2]a ) , we focus on a mixed cell with value @xmath93 .",
    "it is not hard to check that the discrete gradient at the center cell ( without upwinding ) is in this case @xmath119 which is already a bad gradient .",
    "taking into account the upwinding process , we find that @xmath120 this is clearly a bad value ( it is expected to find 0 ) , but moreover the value behaves like  @xmath121  ! at the neighbour mixed cell with discrete value @xmath92 ( figure  [ fig:2]b ) ) , the reconstructed gradient is @xmath119 , still incorrect .",
    "but , curiously , because of the upwind process , one can check that the resulting discrete divergence has the good value : @xmath122 clearly , this example shows an imbalance of grid - aligned directional derivatives due to nonlinear limitations of the slope limiters , and the process is unable to predict the gradient directions correctly .",
    "still on this example , let us also mention the observed oscillatory behaviour of discrete gradients along with the interface line , which , is , in our opinion , probably another source of odd - even interface instability .",
    "( a ) for the following discrete solutions , using direction - by - direction slope limiters ( superbee or ultrabee ) at the center of each grid .",

    "as represented in figure  [ fig:3 ] with a disk interface as example , the discrete profile of  @xmath7 function in regions where @xmath126 ( top and bottom of the disk ) and in the direction of velocity can be seen as a discretization of a smooth function , varying into @xmath127 $ ] because of the finite volume mean process . on figure  [ fig:3 ] where @xmath2 is aligned with the @xmath128-axis , applying one - dimensional too compressive limiters ( superbee , overbee , ultrabee ) will create spurious staircase - shaped functions in the top and bottom disk areas .",
    "consequently , some of the initial geometry information will be lost .",
    "we believe that that this loss of accuracy is at the origin of spurious strange attractor shapes like octagons . to remedy this problem",
    ", one could imagine an hybrid slope limiter strategy that takes into account the direction deviation between @xmath95 and velocity @xmath2 .",

    "is almost collinear to the velocity vector ( in green ) , the discrete interface is essentially spread over one point whereas for areas with @xmath95 orthogonal or quasi - orthogonal to @xmath2 , the discrete @xmath7 profile in the velocity direction can be rather seen as a smooth varying function with values in @xmath127 $ ] and thus should be treated as a smooth function in this direction . ]",
    "time discretization is also an important topic for interface capturing , not only for accuracy purposes but also especially for stability reasons .",
    "time advance schemes for interface capturing are explicit .",
    "the simplest one is the one - step first - order euler scheme that reads for the semi - discrete ( in time ) advection equation @xmath129 it is very easy to derive the equivalent equation of the explicit first - order euler scheme , i.e. the equation which is solved at the second - order accuracy by the euler scheme , by taylor expansions .",
    "one finds @xmath130 the residual term at the right hand side is unfortunately an antidiffusive term that makes the associated problem ill - posed .",
    "remark that the antidiffusion matrix @xmath131 is negative semi - definite with a kernel @xmath132 . here",
    "again , one can observe an anisotropic behaviour according to the direction of advection . now because in our context  @xmath7 is a nonsmooth function , actually higher - order terms in the taylor expansion are also important ( consider a scaling ) .",
    "actually the true key word here is numerical stability .",
    "one has to use numerically stable time advance schemes in order to not produce spurious interface instabilities .",
    "we will see below in numerical experiments that even if spatial discretization in done properly , it will lead to linear instabilities evolving into nonlinear zigzag - shaped modes if the explicit euler scheme is used , whereas second - order runge - kutta rk2 integrators eliminate these spurious instabilities .",
    "from the above numerical study and numerical analysis , we understand that accurate interface capturing methods must satisfy a set of requirements .",
    "we have identified the four following `` constraints '' :    1 .",
    "the solver has to be overcompressive in the normal direction to the interface for low - diffusive properties ; 2 .",
    "the solver should be second - order accurate in directions tangent to the interface ; 3 .",
    "the gradient limiting process has to preserve the ( unlimited ) gradient direction @xmath95 ( normal direction ) for accuracy purposes ; 4 .",
    "high - order explicit time integrators having a reasonable stability region are required .    to fulfil the above requirements , our choice moves towards multidimensional limiting process ( mlp ) strategies ( @xcite ) that are generalizations of the limiters to the multidimensional case , thus allowing to keep control of the gradient direction . for time integrators",
    "we will simply use second - order runge - kutta rk2 schemes .",
    "multidimensional limiting process or mlp has been introduced by different authors @xcite in order to provide an improved accuracy for multidimensional problems , especially for high - speed computational fluid dynamics .",
    "it is a natural extension of the one - dimensional slope - limiting process that takes into account the local neighbouring information for both gradient reconstruction and limitation .",
    "mlp can be formulated on general unstructured grids . in our paper",
    ", we will restrict to cartesian grids even if the use of unstructured grids is possible .",
    "one of the difficulties in the multidimensional case is the definition of limitation criteria . before mlp ,",
    "older concepts like local extremum diminishing ( led ) proposed by kuzmin and turek @xcite are a substitute to the one - dimensional total variation diminishing ( tvd ) tool . the idea is to limit a local reconstruction in order not to create new extrema , allowing for a @xmath55 diminishing property .",
    "here we decide to use mlp as a compressive multidimensional gradient reconstruction algorithm for interface capturing .",
    "let us consider a two - dimensional cartesian grid made of cells named @xmath133 indexed by @xmath134 .",
    "the general process is the following :    1 .",
    "first estimate the local cell discrete gradient @xmath135 .",
    "this can be performed easily by means of approximation formulas or quadrature formulas in the case of finite volume approximation .",
    "2 .   consider piecewise - linear local approximations in the form : @xmath136 the coefficient @xmath137 will be a scalar gradient limiting factor .",
    "3 .   limit the slope in order not to create new local extrema at the cell corners , following a led criterion  @xcite . actually , for interface capturing we try to be as sharp as possible but without creating new local extrema , leading to a natural extension of the overbee slope limiter .",
    "4 .   reconstruct a piecewise constant sub - square solution : the piecewise linear local solution is projected onto a piecewise constant subcell solution over the four natural corner subsquares of each cell .",
    "this projection allows us to easily compute upwind numerical fluxes .",
    "5 .   finally compute the advective fluxes at the edges .",
    "the involved geometric elements for performing the process are summarized on figure  [ fig : mlp ] .",
    "[ fig:1 ]        now we give mathematical and technical details on both gradient prediction and limitation .",

    "<S> in this paper , stable and `` low - diffusive '' multidimensional interface capturing ( ic ) schemes using slope limiters are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that direction - by - direction slope - limited muscl schemes create geometrical artefacts and thus return a poor accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> we here focus on this particular issue and show that the reconstruction of gradient directions are an important factor of accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> the use of a multidimensional limiting process ( mlp ) added with an adequate time integration scheme leads to an artefact - free and instability - free interface capturing ( ic ) approach . </S>",
    "<S> numerical experiments like the reference kothe - rider forward - backward advection case show the accuracy of the approach . we also show that the approach can be extended to the more complex compressible multimaterial hydrodynamics case , with potentially an arbitrary number of fluids . </S>",
    "<S> we also believe that this approach is appropriate for multicore / manycore architecture because of its simd feature , which may be another asset compared to interface reconstruction approaches . </S>"
