    "dwarf galaxies are important constituents of the universe because they are both the most numerous type of galaxy and test beds for examining galactic evolution on small scales .",
    "additionally , dwarf galaxies show varying and extended periods of star formation ( sf ) over the age of the universe @xcite .",
    "one method of examining these populations is through metallicities , specifically through metallicity distribution functions ( mdf ) .",
    "metallicity measurements of large numbers of stars over the full range of metallicities are crucial in studying the populations of dwarf galaxies because they allow us to construct robust mdfs , examine any structure indicating sub - components , and measure gradients across the galaxy . the star formation history ( sfh ) , accretion , outflows via supernova and stellar winds , and galaxy interactions that cause tidal or ram - pressure stripping all play a part in shaping the mdf .",
    "the shape of the mdf offers clues to the galaxy s evolution , which can be characterized by fitting them to analytic chemical evolution models .",
    "the most basic analytic chemical evolution model is a simple closed box , where gas turns into stars , the stars evolve and return enriched gas to the interstellar medium ( ism ) , which is again formed into stars . in this model",
    "no material enters or leaves the system .",
    "however , the simple model is often an inaccurate description of the chemical evolution in dwarf galaxies because the simple model overpredicts the number of metal poor stars ( i.e.  the g dwarf problem ) .",
    "semi - analytic chemical evolution models and hydrodynamic simulations utilize the galactic sfhs of dwarf galaxies , and nucleosynthetic yields from type i and ii supernova ( sn ) , to predict the gas inflow and outflow necessary to match abundance patterns from multiple elements and the overall mdfs . in lieu of these complex models",
    "the simple analytic chemical evolution models offer a concise way to quantify and compare the mdfs of different galaxies , providing insight into the enrichment history of galaxies , especially when only modeling the overall mdf of the dwarf galaxy without information on @xmath1 abundances .",
    "recent works have examined the stellar metallicities found in dwarf galaxies by using medium and high resolution spectra on 8 - 10 meter telescopes .",
    "these works examine variations in @xmath1 elements , abundance patterns in the lowest metallicity stars , abundance patterns in r and s process elements , and the overall mdfs to better understand the processes that are important in the chemical evolution ; processes that include the sfhs , the imf , stellar nucleosynthesis , and the time - scales for the formation of galaxies .",
    "one of the largest samples of stellar metallicities ( @xmath2 3000 stars ) comes from @xcite who present spectroscopic mdfs for 15 dsph and 7 dirs .",
    "they also fit their mdfs to analytical chemical evolution models , extended the stellar - mass stellar - metallicity relation and determined that the mdf shapes vary depending on the morphology such that dsph tend to have narrower mdfs than dirs .    while individual spectra of stars in dwarf galaxies provide abundance and kinematic information , they are still difficult to obtain .",
    "spectra of stars in more distant local group ( lg ) objects are limited to small sample sizes by the long exposure times and large telescopes required to make the observations . while spectral targets are limited to the few brightest stars , photometric metallicities probe deeper and thus sample stars that are typically more representative of the metallicity distribution .",
    "photometric metallicities , though not as accurate as spectra , provide measurements for every star in the field , allowing us to increase samples sizes by an order of a magnitude .",
    "this allows us to probe galaxies farther out in the lg , especially when using the resolving power of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "we obtained hst images in metallicity sensitive filters ( f390 m ) , and 2 wide band filters ( f555w and f814w ) for four lg galaxies . by measuring every star in the field",
    "we can build up larger samples of stellar metallicities in these dwarf galaxies .",
    "in this work we present photometric metallicities of individual stars in four lg dwarf galaxies : leo i , leo ii , ic 1613 and phoenix .",
    "we chose galaxies that span different morphologies , masses , sfhs and distances from the milky way ( mw ) .",

    "the general technique to measure photometric metallicities relates color to metallicity .",
    "the stellar properties that control observed colors are metallicity , effective temperature and surface gravity .",
    "however , effective temperature and surface gravity are dictated by the mass , metallicity and the current evolutionary stage of a given star .",
    "for populations of comparable age the color is directly related to the metallicity . however , an individual giant branch star can be redder either because it has higher metallicity or because it is older , leading to a color degeneracy between age and metallicity . for a mixed aged population ,",
    "the younger giants are hotter and more massive than older giants of the same metallicity so the color - metallicity relation no longer holds .",
    "using specifically designed hst wfc3 filters which separate the effects of metallicity and temperature on color , we can break the age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "the metallicity sensitivity of the ( f390m  f555w ) color comes from the f390 m medium band filter which covers the ca h @xmath3 k spectral features , one of the strongest metal absorption features in the visible spectrum . the temperature sensitive color , ( f555w  f814w ) , uses two broad band filters which cover mostly continuum .    the color - color diagram ( f390m  f555w , f555w ",
    "f814w ) , has been shown to effectively separate the competing color changes due to metallicity and temperature @xcite , breaking the age - metallicity degeneracy . in the color - color diagram the color change between a 12 and 4 gyr isochrone of the same metallicity is on order of a few hundredths of a magnitude , ( demonstrated in figure 5 of ross et al .",
    "therefore , these two colors can be used to measure individual stellar metallicities of populations of mixed ages and abundances , like dwarf galaxies .",
    "we used only giant branch stars with errors less than 0.05 mag in all filters .",
    "these error cuts resulted in samples of 3,449 stars , 444 stars , 896 and 578 stars for leo i , leo ii , ic 1613 and phoenix respectively .",
    "stellar metallicities are assigned in the ( f390m  f555w , f555w ",
    "f814w ) color - color diagram where each giant branch star is matched to the closest dartmouth isochrone @xcite in a grid ( spaced by 0.05 dex in [ fe / h ] and assuming solar [ @xmath1/fe ] ) .",
    "the isochrones were empirically corrected to align with globular clusters of known metallicities ( m92 , ngc 6752 , ngc 104 , ngc 5927 and ngc 6791 with [ fe / h ] @xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively ) .",
    "the empirical corrections were derived in @xcite using the same hst filters used in this study .",
    "this method of deriving photometric stellar metallicities from hst photometry was tested against the listed globular clusters and shown to produce metallicities with errors of 0.15 - 0.3 dex , with larger errors occurring at lower metallicities .",
    "see @xcite for the full details on the metallicity derivations from colors .",
    "although each giant branch star is matched to an isochrone grid of [ fe / h ] assuming a solar abundance ratio , many stars are known to have @xmath1 enhancement , especially low metallicity ones .",
    "the colors we measure are a product of [ fe / h ] and the @xmath1 enhancement ; therefore , it is more accurate to think of our measurement as an indicator of the total metallicity , [ m / h ] , that represents the intrinsic combination of [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath1/fe ] , even though we are matching each star to an isochrone grid of [ fe / h ] .",
    "total metallicity , [ m / h ] , and the iron abundance , [ fe / h ] , are often used interchangeably , because they are usually very similar ; only in the cases of large abundance variations ( e.g @xmath1 enhancements ) do the two values differ . in @xcite",
    "we quantified the amount of color change expected from @xmath1 enhancements and provide a means of calculating the [ fe / h ] if the @xmath1 enhancement is known .",
    "in addition to measuring metallicities of individual stars based on color , we have also developed a synthetic color - color diagram technique to derive a mdf from photometry .",
    "the technique uses isochrones and an initial mass function ( imf ) to make a model color - color diagram of the synthetic populations in order to reproduce the observed color - color diagram .",
    "the technique is similar to the synthetic cmd method used to derive sfhs ( see tolstoy et al .",
    "in the cmd the position and number density of stars depend upon the imf , age , and metallicity . as pointed out by @xcite",
    ", the cmd of any complex stellar system will be a composite of all the individual stellar populations that comprise the system .",
    "therefore it is possible to model a large number of simple stellar populations ( ssps ) in various combinations to reproduce the observed data , including the observational errors . the most likely combination of populations of various ages and metallicities that best match the observations will give the sfh .",
    "in the color - color diagram the position and number density of stars depend upon metallicity and the imf of a population , and is independent of age , unlike a cmd .",
    "the synthetic color - color diagram method of deriving mdfs solves for the weights of a given linear combination of populations that equals the observed color - color diagram ; the weights from the linear combination give the metallicity distribution of the population .",
    "the advantage is that a given population will occupy a locus where color and number density of stars found at each location within the color - color diagram is dictated by stellar evolution and the imf .    to create the synthetic color - color diagrams a kroupa imf @xcite and colors from the dartmouth isochrones",
    "are used to initially populate a grid of hess diagrams of ssps .",
    "the isochrone colors were empirically corrected following the calibration described in @xcite .",
    "the grid spans a metallicity range @xmath9 } < + 0.5 $ ] in steps of 0.05 dex .",
    "each ssp hess diagram was blurred using the measured photometric errors from each dwarf galaxy .",
    "the linear combination of ssps that reproduces the observed color - color diagram are calculated from the array of synthetic hess diagrams .",
    "the isochrone color spacing and the bin spacing of the hess diagrams ( 0.04 by 0.04 mag ) require that the metallicity spacing ( and subsequent color change ) be larger than the hess bins .",
    "in some regions of the color - color diagram isochrones spaced 0.05 dex of [ fe / h ] apart have a color change less than 0.04 mag",
    ". if the color change is less than the bin size only one of the weights for the linear combination of isochrones will be positive the rest will have negative and nonphysical weights .",
    "additionally , in the synthetic color - color diagram , when the synthetic ssps are blurred by the photometric errors ( up to @xmath100.07 mag near the bottom of the giant branch ) , isochrones closer than 0.15 dex produce nonphysical negative solutions . to account for the issues arising from the isochrone color spacing and the bin spacing in the hess diagrams ,",
    "we combine the weights from various metallicity combinations to ensure we sample all metallicities equally .",
    "we start with the full range of metallicities ( -2.5 @xmath11 [ fe / h ] @xmath11 0.5 , and spacing of 0.05 dex ) , calculate the linear combination , eliminate the metallicities that have negative , nonphysical solutions and recalculate the linear weights .",
    "this leads to uneven spacing in metallicity due to the smaller color separations at low metallicity and larger color spacing at high metallicity .",
    "we repeat the calulation with different metallicity spacings ( 0.1 , 0.15 , 0.2 , and 0.25 dex ) and shifts of 0.05 dex in order to fill in the metallicity spacings .",
    "the weights from various metallicity combinations are combine to ensure we sample all metallicities equally .",
    "the mdf weights are checked by creating a synthetic color - color diagram to compare to the observations .",
    "we examine the residuals between our observed hess diagram and a synthetic hess diagram to ensure that @xmath12 of the residuals deviate by less than 3@xmath13 of the overall residual within the hess diagram .",
    "the residual hess diagram is created using the following equation :    @xmath14    to test the synthetic color - color diagram method of deriving mdfs we performed this analysis on globular clusters of known metallicity , specifically m92 , ngc 6791 , ngc 104 , and ngc 5927 , with [ fe / h]@xmath15 respectively . for these gcs",
    "we adopted all of the parameters reported in @xcite , where the individual mdfs were derived . here after we will refer to the mdfs derived using the synthetic color - color diagram method as ` synthetic mdfs ' , and the mdfs created from individually measured metallicities as ` individual mdfs ' .",
    "the synthetic mdfs recovered peak metallicities that are all within 0.05 dex of the literature values .",
    "additionally we find the synthetic distributions to be over two times as narrow as the distributions found from fitting each star individually ( @xmath160.15 , 0.19 , 0.24 , and 0.19 for m92 , ngc 6752 , ngc 104 and ngc 5927 , respectively ) .",
    "the narrower mdfs are expected because this method accounts for the photometric errors , while the individually measured metallicities do not .",
    "figure [ clusters ] shows the process and final results of the synthetic color - color diagram method of deriving mdfs .",
    "the top panels display the observed sequence of giant branch stars in the color - color diagram .",
    "the middle panels show the hess diagram of the residuals as described in equation ( 1 ) .",
    "the bottom panels show the resulting mdfs from the synthetic method ( solid line ) as well as the individual mdfs ( dashed line ) .",
    "the mdfs in the bottom panels illustrate the utility of using the synthetic method over the individual star method , wherein the synthetic mdfs are 30 - 50 @xmath0 narrower than the individual mdfs .",
    "the synthetic method is statistical in nature , therefore it does not provide individual metallicities for each star , but rather gives the relative number of stars at each metallicity for the population as a whole .",
    "we directly compare the subset of our individually measured stellar sample that overlap with spectroscopic measurements from @xcite in figure [ z_comp ] .",
    "@xcite used medium resolution spectra and spectral synthesis of fe i absorption lines to measure metallicities for 814 , 256 , and 125 stars in leo i , leo ii , and ic 1613 , respectively . due to the greater spatial extent of their sample",
    "we were only able to compare a total of 170 stars ; 108 from leo i , 54 from leo ii , and 8 from ic 1613 .",
    "the standard deviation of metallicity differences is 0.38 dex , a wider spread ( by 0.1 to 0.2 dex ) than found in the globular clusters from @xcite .",
    "the larger spread between photometric and spectroscopic metallicity can be partially attributed to the difference in photometric errors between the dwarf galaxies and the globular clusters .",
    "the photometric errors along the dwarf galaxies giant branch are 2 to 4 times larger than equivalent absolute magnitudes found in the globular clusters , which translates to a @xmath17[fe / h ] of @xmath100.1 dex .",
    "the larger spread might also be partially accounted for by @xmath1 abundance variations .",
    "@xcite find that variations in @xmath1 abundance cause color changes analogous to metallicity changes of a few tenths of a dex ( specifically @xmath18[fe / h]/@xmath19 @xmath10 @xmath20 across the metallicity range ) . without knowing the intrinsic @xmath1 abundance , and assuming it to be solar ,",
    "naturally our metallicity measurement will be lower than the actual [ fe / h ] .",
    "in general dwarf galaxies tend to show less @xmath1 enhancements than globular clusters of similar metallicity .",
    "@xcite find that the @xmath1 abundance distributions slowly evolve from large @xmath1 enhancement at low metallicity to roughly solar ratios at [ fe / h ] close to a tenth solar .",
    "any @xmath1 enhancement will cause an underestimate of the metallicity using the photometric method .",
    "in addition to the greater difference between photometric and spectroscopic metallicities , the photometric metallicities deviate more towards lower metallicity .",
    "this is not unexpected as we assign metallicities with an isochrone grid assuming no @xmath1 enhancements . for any star that has an enhanced @xmath1 abundance",
    "the assigned metallicity from isochrones will be lower than the intrinsic stellar metallicity because the color of a star of solar @xmath1 abundance will have the same color as an @xmath1 enhanced star with lower [ fe / h ] .",
    "the stars with photometric metallicities measured to be [ m / h ] @xmath212 tend to be the most discrepant , with differences @xmath22 1 dex .",
    "the main difference is due to the decreasing color change as a function of decreasing metallicity , which means that a small random variation in color for a bluer ( metal poor ) star will produce a larger discrepancy in the reported metallicity than the same amount of variation in a redder ( metal rich ) star .",
    "we used the synthetic color - color diagram technique to derive mdfs for the four dwarf galaxies in addition to the individually measured metallicities that were compiled to make mdfs .",
    "figure [ dwarfs ] , following the same layout as figure [ clusters ] , shows the results from the synthetic mdf derivation method .",
    "the top panels show the color - color diagrams for the four dwarfs , the middle panels show the residual hess diagrams , and the bottom panels show the resulting synthetic ( solid line ) and individual ( dash - dotted line ) mdfs .",
    "the individual and synthetic mdfs both show similar shapes and peaks , although the synthetic mdfs are narrower , as was noted in section 3.3 from the mdfs of globular clusters .    for the dwarf galaxies the average metallicities of the synthetic mdfs are 0.1 to 0.2 dex more metal rich than the individual mdfs , although the mdf peaks from the two methods are more closely aligned .",
    "additionally , the globular cluster mdfs from the two methods are not offset .",
    "this leads us to believe that the underlying population distribution is causing the offset . for the dwarf galaxies the difference in average metallicity from the two methods can be attributed to the differences in the metal poor tails of the mdfs , where the individual mdf has photometric errors that propigate into a wider spread in metallicity .",
    "additionally , the fact that the color change due to metallicity is smaller at low metallicities means that for the same amount of color error there will be a larger spread in metallicities at low values .",
    "the large extent of the metal poor tail in the individual mdf is the main driver in the offset of the average metallicities for the 2 methods .    despite the offset in average metallicity",
    "we believe the synthetic method provides a more accurate mdf shape than the mdf produced by individually measuring metallicities with isochrone matching .",
    "the synthetic method includes stellar sequence information from the color - color diagram , and it systematically accounts for the photometric errors , whereas the individual method relies only on the photometry .    in figure [ dwmdf_comp ]",
    "we compare our two methods of deriving mdfs to the spectroscopic mdfs available from @xcite .",
    "table [ mdfparam ] reports the average metallicities , widths , and number of stars measured using the three different mdf derivation methods for each galaxy .",
    "the spectroscopic metallicities from @xcite are more spatially extended than our photometric data . since we are probing a smaller area within each galaxy , it is expected that our mdfs will have some differences compared to the spectroscopic mdfs .",
    "the results for each dwarf galaxy are discussed in the following paragraphs .    for leo",
    "i we find @xmath11[m / h]@xmath23 @xmath24 .",

    "therefore we also tested an analytical model which includes infalling gas .",
    "we fit the ` best accretion model ' defined by @xcite which allows for the gas mass to start small ( or at zero ) , rise to a maximum , then approach zero again as all the mass is accumulated in stars .",
    "the accreted gas is assumed to be metal free .",
    "lynden - bell found a relation between the gas mass , @xmath52 , stellar mass , @xmath53 , and total final mass , @xmath54 , that permits an analytic solution to the differential metallicity distribution ( also see pagel 1997 ) , defined as :    @xmath55    where all quantities are in units of the initial gas mass .",
    "when @xmath56 the equation reduces to a closed box where @xmath57 .",
    "when @xmath54 is larger than 1 it essentially becomes a measure of the total amount of gas that has entered the system over the lifetime of the galaxy so @xmath54 can be thought of as an accretion parameter .",
    "however , it should be noted that while equation ( 3 ) produces the desired mdf shapes , there is no physical rationale behind the actual form of the equation .",
    "equation ( 3 ) simply assumes a quadratic relation between gas mass and the stellar mass that peaks then decays as a function of stellar mass .",

    "the analytic form of the differential metallicity distribution for these models requires the instantaneous recycling and mixing approximations , where all sn yields are immediately and uniformly returned to the ism , respectively .",
    "the instantaneous recycling approximation does not reproduce the characteristic patterns seen in @xmath1 element abundances .",
    "however @xmath1 abundances can not be determined with photometric data alone , therefore we could not constrain more sophisticated models that account for time dependent recycling .",
    "the analytic models used in this work neglect some of the physics known to be important for galactic chemical evolution , however , these models provide insight into the difference in evolution between galaxies .      for dsph ,",
    "one leading hypothesis is that their chemical evolution was interrupted by the removal of gas .",
    "this follows from the morphology - density relationship where most dwarf galaxies close to a large primary are dsph , and devoid of gas @xcite .",
    "environmental mechanisms such as tidal stirring and ram pressure stripping have been invoked to transform close satellites from a star forming , gas rich , dir , into a quiescent , gas poor dsph that are found close to a much larger primary @xcite .",
    "@xcite used simulations to shows that gas rich dwarfs can be stripped of their gas over a few pericentric passages as they travel through the hot halo of a larger primary .",
    "ram pressure stripping effectively cuts off all star formation , stopping the chemical evolution prematurely , likely producing a steep truncation on the metal rich end of the mdf .",
    "@xcite show that a sharp metal rich cutoff of the mdf is primarily seen in dsph type galaxies , not dirs .",
    "additionally , they added a ram pressure stripping term to the simple chemical evolution model to fit the metal rich cutoff , however , this model was found to not have the best match to the dsphs in their sample .",
    "since the accretion models fit all the dsph galaxies better than the simple models we would like to incorporate a metallicity cutoff into the accretion models , that would simulate ram pressure stripping .",
    "a more basic approach to testing a metal rich cutoff is achieved by changing the upper metallicity bounds to a more metal poor value when integrating the equations of chemical evolution .",
    "we ran the simple and accretion chemical evolution models with an imposed metal rich cutoff , truncating the cem at a lower metallicity than the model would naturally evolve to , in order to approximate the effects of ram pressure stripping .",
    "a sharp cutoff such as this is somewhat nonphysical , since ram pressure stripping does not immediately remove all gas , additionally the sf would not be immediately cutoff at a particular metallicity across the galaxy",
    ". however , this simplistic approach allows us to quickly and efficiently test our models for signs of truncation .    besides the dsph galaxies",
    ", dir are expected to have a steeper mdf on the metal rich side than the chemical evolution models predict .",
    "the mdf of a star forming galaxy should not look like a completed chemical evolution model , rather , the mdf should show a more abrupt cutoff on the metal rich side because dir are still forming stars and enriching their ism and by definition are not at the end of their chemical evolution .",
    "fitting cem with an imposed metal rich cutoff will also simulate an incomplete chemical evolution , in addition to a cem that has been halted due to ram pressure stripping .      to find the best model parameters we perform 10@xmath60 trials of the simple model while varying the effective yield , @xmath49 .",
    "we calculate the least squares value between each model and mdf to determine the best parameters for the individual and synthetic mdfs for each galaxy .",

    "the best fit parameters for each model and mdf are listed in table [ cemparam ] .    to fit the individual mdfs the three chemical evolution models have been convolved with a gaussian with a dispersion equal to the dispersion of the difference between the photometric and spectroscopic metallicities ( @xmath13=0.38 dex ) to account for the spreading of the mdf from the photometric errors .",
    "the synthetic mdf method models the photometric errors , therefore we do not convolve the chemical evolution models with any additional errors when fitting to the synthetic mdfs .",
    "the individual mdfs do not show an abrupt metal rich cutoff , mostly due to the scatter in metallicity that comes from the photometric technique as can be seen in figure [ cem ] .",
    "however , in the narrower synthetic mdfs we do see truncation of the mdfs on the metal rich side , indicative of ram pressure stripping . in the accretion model",
    "the larger the m parameter the more the cem takes on a gaussian shape . while this is good for fitting the narrow peak of the synthetic mdfs , it does not account for the asymmetry of the extended metal poor tail and the sharper truncation of the mdf on the metal rich side as shown in figure [ cem_syn ] .",
    "the accretion + truncation model allows for a narrower mdf peak , and keeps the asymmetry by truncating the metal rich side of the distributions , which produces a better model fit for the synthetic mdfs in all four dwarf galaxies , as shown in figure [ cem_syn_cut ] .",

    "however , leo ii shows no signs of dynamical interactions , beside the fact that it is a dsph .",
    "moreover the similarity of the mdf of leo ii , ic 1613 and phoenix suggest these galaxies experienced comparable conditions during their chemical evolution .",
    "since ic 1613 and phoenix are isolated and evolved without outside influence , it could be inferred that leo ii also chemically evolved without dynamical influence from the mw .",
    "the sfh of leo ii shows that 95@xmath0 of the stars were formed over 6.3 gyr ago @xcite ; with so many of the stars formed at early times leo ii has had ample time to be transformed from a disk to a spheroid after most of the chemical evolution occurred .",
    "we do find the accretion + truncation model to be the best fit for leo ii , where there the cutoff on the metal - rich side of leo ii s mdf is shallower than predicted from the accretion model .",
    "we interpret this as an indication of ram - pressure stripping ; however , in leo ii , the cutoff is not nearly as drastic as leo i , indicating that most of the chemical evolution had occurred before the mw began stripping and truncating leo ii s sf .",
    "while this is by no means direct proof , the evidence supports the idea that leo ii chemically evolved without strong dynamical influence from the mw .",
    "leo i on the other hand shows evidence of strong tidal interactions with the mw . the proper motions and dynamic modeling of leo",
    "i show it passed into the mw s potential 2.33 gyr ago , reaching its pericentric approach 1.05 gyr ago @xcite .",
    "additionally , the dynamic results correlate well with the cmd based sfhs .",
    "leo i shows slow ancient sf , with an increase to its highest rate 2 - 3 gyr ago , after which the galaxy stopped forming stars 1 gyr ago @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that the increased sf at 3 gyr and the abrupt stop at 1 gyr could have been caused by ram pressure compression or gravitational torques exerted by the mw as the galaxy passed into the mw s potential .",
    "for leo i , the dynamical history has had a significant impact on the sfh , and by extension on the chemical evolution .",
    "we interpret the sharp difference in the m parameters along with the dynamic information in the literature on leo i , leo ii , ic 1613 and phoenix , as possible evidence that the galaxies chemically evolved under different conditions .",
    "the first is passive chemical evolution , where gas rich , star forming galaxies ( i.e.  dir ) gradually truncate their star formation as the gas supply is exhausted , evolving into a dtrans , producing a broad mdf in the process .",
    "this type of evolution is what is most likely what is seen in leo ii ( dsph ) , phoenix ( dtrans ) and ic 1613 ( dir ) , at various stages in the process .",
    "leo ii formed the majority of its stars over 6 gyr ago and the mdf suggests it chemically evolved without significant interactions before it was transformed into a dsph by the mw .",
    "phoenix appears to be in the process of passively evolving ; the dynamics and sfh show no indication of interaction . instead the sfh shows a slow decrease in sf up to a few 100 myr ago when sf stopped .",
    "additionally , ic 1613 is isolated from both the mw and m31 , and does not show dynamical evidence of interactions , and the mdf of ic 1613 is similar in shape to leo ii and phoenix .",
    "it is known that dsph are created through the gravitational influence of a larger primary , if the interaction occurs concurrent with the chemical evolution it will be reflected in the mdf .",
    "previous studies have shown that the mw s influence on leo i is reflected in the sfh and dynamics ; we are suggesting it is also shown in the narrow mdf .",
    "one understated assumption in analytic chemical evolution models is that each model represents the end point of that galaxy s evolution .",
    "however , dir and dtrans are not at the end of their chemical evolution since they are still forming stars and enriching the ism",
    ". therefore we must take care when comparing the mdfs of active galaxies such as ic 1613 and phoenix , to the dsphs like leo i and ii , which arguably , have completed their chemical evolution 1 to 6 gyr ago respectively .",
    "additionally , for dsph the morphology - density relation suggest that the removal of gas interrupted the chemical evolution altering the chemistry to no longer reflect the end state of chemical evolution models .",
    "these various endpoints can be seen in our galaxy sample .",
    "leo i shows a mdf truncated on the metal rich side indicative of a halted chemical evolution .",
    "leo ii shows signs of mild truncation , as the cem slightly overpredicts the number of metal rich stars and the accretion + truncation model was the best fit model for leo ii . as we discussed previously",
    ", leo ii is within the virial radius of the mw , but has a mostly circular orbit at a large distance , therefore it has been weakly affected by the mws gravity , as the mild truncation shows .    as a dir , ic 1613 is still actively forming stars and enriching its ism , therefore we would not expect the mdf to reflect a fully completed chemical evolution . the ongoing enrichment in ic 1613 manifests itself with fewer metal rich stars than predicted by the cem .",
    "phoenix , on the other hand , is the only galaxy to nearly match the metal rich end of the cem .",
    "phoenix is a transition galaxy , that expelled its last remaining gas reserves with the final burst of star formation @xmath10 100 myr ago @xcite .",
    "the isolated location and apparent exhaustion of gas imply that phoenix has completed its chemical evolution .",
    "one other consideration is that our field of view is small for all of the galaxies in our sample ( covering 5 - 20@xmath0 of the various galaxies ) . given that many dwarf galaxies show metallicity gradients , and variations in sfh as a function of radius , the mdfs will also change as a function of radius , and the solutions to the cems can not be applied to the entire galaxy .",
    "we measured the metallicity distribution functions of leo i , leo ii , ic 1613 and phoenix dwarf galaxies by measuring individual stellar metallicities , and by modeling the stellar population to create synthetic mdfs for each galaxy .",
    "we find the synthetic mdfs to be a better representation of the overall metallicity distribution , because this method cuts down the photometric scatter propagated into the photometric metallicities .",
    "we fit each mdf with chemical evolution models .",
    "we find the simple model to be a poor fit for all of our dwarf galaxies , while the accretion + truncation model is the best fit for the synthetic mdfs for all four of the galaxies .",
    "the fact that all of our galaxies are best fit by the accretion + truncation model reflects the fact that most galaxies do not make it to the natural completion of the chemical evolution , either because they are still actively forming stars ( dirs ) or because they were truncated by other processes such as ram pressure stripping ( dsphs ) .",
    "we find a similar accretion parameter , ( m@xmath104 ) , for leo ii , ic 1613 and phoenix despite the fact that they all have different masses , sfh , morphologies and average metallicities .",
    "we interpret the resemblance in their mdfs as an indication that their chemical evolutions occurred under similar conditions , which indicates that leo ii completed most of its chemical evolution in isolation before it was significantly tidally disrupted and transformed into a dsph type galaxy by the mw .",
    "leo i has the narrowest mdf , a much larger accretion parameter , and shows significant evidence for interactions with the mw at the same time as the galaxy was forming stars and chemically evolving .",
    "we suggest that the mdfs can reveal dynamical interactions if they occur in concert with sf and chemical evolution , or if the galaxy chemically evolved in relative isolation .",
    "the narrower mdfs are indicative of interactions shaping the galaxy s present morphology , while a broader mdf indicates a passive evolution .",
    "the differences in the mdfs could be a way to distinguish between the two formation pathways .",
    "to further this theory we would need to examine the mdfs and dynamic histories of many lg dwarf galaxies .    additionally , we measured metallicity gradients for leo i and leo ii .",
    "we see some evidence of gradients in phoenix and ic 1613 , however our data does not cover the radial extent required to determine a metallicity gradient greater than the error bars .",
    "support for program 12304 was provided by nasa through a grant from the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc .",
