    "<S> introduction _ - how and why glasses form is one the most intriguing open questions of modern science . </S>",
    "<S> a glass is a rigid material yet lacks crystalline order . </S>",
    "<S> it has been recognized thousands of years ago that glasses can be made by fast - cooling a liquid below its solidus temperature to avoid crystallization . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting supercooled liquid displays an exponential increase of its viscosity . as such , glasses are inherently non - equilibrium states of matter , even though on any reasonable experimental timescale the material appears to be static.@xcite    the natural question is why the crystal does not nucleate inside the supercooled liquid phase . </S>",
    "<S> one of the possible answers revolves around the existence of local short - range order in both the liquid , the supercooled liquid and the glass phase . </S>",
    "<S> if the short - ranged density correlations in the liquid are manifestly different than those characterizing the preferred crystalline state , a glass can be formed through fast - cooling . </S>",
    "<S> the system then freezes into a locally ordered frustrated configuration that requires a macroscopic number of rearrangements to lower the energy and realize the standard crystalline form .    </S>",
    "<S> an example is the icosahedral short - range order first proposed@xcite and later observed in metallic glasses such as ti - zr - ni.@xcite a single icosahedron is much denser packed than any crystalline structure like fcc or hcp , which suggests that in the liquid phase the dominant density correlations are icosahedral . </S>",
    "<S> however , one can not fill space with icosahedral order , leading to glassy behavior at low temperatures .    </S>",
    "<S> a more recent example is found in self - generated electron glasses.@xcite in the organic layered materials of the @xmath1-family , the electrons display distinct glassy features after fast - cooling to avoid a stripe ordering transition . upon cooling , </S>",
    "<S> the local charge order present in the high - temperature liquid strengthens even further within the glassy regime .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we propose , based on the assumption of glassiness due to locally frustrated order , that such self - generated glasses display a characteristic soft gap in the single - particle density of states . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that self - generated glasses are _ not _ marginally stable,@xcite which would require saturation of the efros - shklovskii bound@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> our single assumption is that the local density of states is only restricted by the stability criterion of eqn . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ int - eq ] ) , we find at large distances @xmath58 this implies that at low energies , the functional shape of the density of states should be @xmath59 consistent with our numerical results .    </S>",
    "<S> note that this gap is stronger than the usual coulomb gap in systems with quenched disorder , where the efros - shklovskii bound is saturated @xmath60 , with @xmath61 a universal disorder - independent pre - factor@xcite . for large disorder strength </S>",

    "<S> the assumptions underlying eqn ( [ int - eq ] ) are invalid and the efros - shklovskii bound can be saturated . </S>",
    "<S> however , when disorder is weak compared to the coulomb energy scale it is an open question how the gap changes from a power - law to an exponentially soft gap .    </S>",

    "<S> ( [ basicrelation ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this relation is satisfied in a simple model of particles on a triangular lattice that was shown earlier to form a glass@xcite .    in self - generated electron glasses , </S>",
    "<S> our result can be directly studied by performing tunneling experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the low - energy density of states can be measured indirectly via the dc conductivity . for structural glasses composed of atoms or molecules </S>",
    "<S> it is difficult to measure the density of states directly . in general , the existence of single - particle excitations of arbitrary low energy lead to characteristic dynamical properties such as crackling and avalanches . </S>",
    "<S> however , because our model does not saturate the efros - shklovskii bound , we do not expect a scale - invariant avalanche distribution.@xcite    we verified our hypothesis using a simple model of coulombicaly interacting particles on a triangular lattice </S>",
    "<S> . it would be interesting to see whether models that exhibit icosahedral local order also display the exponentially soft gap.@xcite the arguments presented in this letter generalize trivially to an arbitrary power - law interaction of the form @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> however , interactions that decay faster than the dimensionality of the system , @xmath64 with @xmath65 do not lead to glassy behavior . </S>",
    "<S> indeed we were not able to reproduce a soft gap for the triangular lattice model with dipolar interactions . </S>",
    "<S> it remains an interesting open question whether long - range interactions are a sine qua non for glass formation.@xcite    in this work we focused only on self - generated systems , in the absence of any quenched disorder . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that for disordered systems there are typically no density correlations . </S>",
    "<S> we verified this by introducing onsite disorder in the triangular lattice model studied . </S>",
    "<S> very weak disorder @xmath66 , however , only influences the states very close to the fermi level . for low energies @xmath67 the standard power - law coulomb gap was recovered , while the density of states for intermediate energies @xmath68 was relatively unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the physics of the exponentially soft gap is stable against very weak disorder , though the precise relation between quenched disordered coulomb glasses and self - generated ones is a matter for future research .    </S>",
    "<S> in this letter , our considerations and analysis centered on the zero - temperature ensemble of metastable states . at finite temperature the gap will be filled , and earlier results are consistent with an exponentially weak scaling at finite temperature , @xmath69 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> again , notice the relative stability compared to systems with quenched disorder where @xmath70.@xcite finally , real glasses are obtained by a fast quench after which the gap needs time to develop . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it has been shown that the soft gap forms extremely slowly , with power - law or even logarithmic time dependence @xmath71 @xcite . in our case , however , the absence of marginal stability opens up the possibility of a true thermodynamic phase transition into a glass phase . how the glass , with its soft gap and the concomitant local density correlations , may be dynamically generated in various systems following a quench to nonzero temperatures </S>",
