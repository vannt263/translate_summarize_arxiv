    "the analysis for a model of molecular motor along a periodic filament with two chemical states has also been done by lacoste , lau , mallick @xcite .",
    "the approach of andrieux and gaspard is much inspired by the network theory of out  of  equilibrium systems .",
    "this theory has been developed by hill @xcite and schnakenberg @xcite with a special attention to biochemical systems .",
    "mathematically , one is interested to the stochastic dynamics of a continuous time random walk on a finite connected graph @xmath0 with multiple edges and no loop , where the jumps along an edge have positive probability rate in both directions .",
    "for such a random walk the stationary distribution @xmath1 exists and is unique . to each oriented bond @xmath2 in @xmath0 from the state @xmath3 to the state @xmath4 , one associates a microscopic affinity defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the probability rate for a jump from @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "note that detailed balance in reversible systems simply corresponds to the fact that all microscopic affinities are zero .",
    "the affinity associated to a given oriented cycle @xmath9 in @xmath0 is then defined as the sum of the microscopic affinities of the oriented bonds forming the cycle : @xmath10 .",
    "it is simple to check that the affinity of a cycle remains the same if one replaces the above microscopic affinity @xmath11 by @xmath12 .",
    "the network theory presented in @xcite is based on the fact that to each unoriented spanning ( maximal ) tree on the graph @xmath0 one can associate in a canonical way a family of oriented cycles , called _ fundamental set of oriented cycles _ , being a sort of basis of the space of all oriented cycles .",
    "each oriented cycle in a fundamental set contains only one oriented edge ( called _ chord _ ) that does not belong to the spanning tree when disregarding orientation . in @xcite schnakenberg",
    "has observed that , for several models of real systems , the macroscopic ( mechanical or thermodynamical ) forces keeping the system out  of  equilibrium are the affinities of the oriented cycles of some fundamental set in @xmath0 ( note that more oriented cycles can have the same affinity ) . in @xcite this situation is called _",

    "let us explain our theoretical contribution in this direction .",
    "first , we recover the above results of andrieux and gaspard by a different approach .",
    "indeed , the fluctuation theorem presented for sums of several generators in section 2.3 of @xcite is not suited for random walks on graphs with multiple edges , but as we show its simple proof can be easily adapted to the present case .",
    "this slightly extended result immediately leads to the fluctuation theorem for the family of currents along all oriented edges , and therefore to the fluctuation theorem for the currents referred to a fundamental set of oriented cycles .",
    "we point out that the fundamental sets of oriented cycles , canonically associated to the spanning trees of the graph @xmath0 , do not cover all possible bases of the cycle space .",
    "we then extend the network theory presented in @xcite and prove a fluctuation theorem for the  currents \" referred to a generic basis of oriented cycles . when dealing with a generic basis ,",
    "chords disappear and the definition of the variables conjugated to the affinities of the oriented cycles in the basis is more algebraic .",
    "we call these conjugate variables _ generalized currents_. their definition needs to associate to each random trajectory an oriented cycle , which must then be decomposed in the basis .",
    "the generalized currents are the coefficients in this decomposition .",
    "their definition is essentially algebraic and differs from the _ derived chain _ discussed in @xcite[chapters 1,2 ] . in the derived chain method , for each oriented cycle @xmath9 one counts the number of times @xmath13 that the cycle has been realized by the trajectory up to a given time @xmath14 ( there is nothing algebraic ) : in @xcite the authors show that this quantity , rescaled by @xmath14 , converges a.s . to some circulation number @xmath15 and show that the entropy production rate in the steady state can be expressed in terms of the circulation numbers . for a discussion on fluctuation theorems satisfied by @xmath16",

    "the above cycle decomposition of the trajectory is particularly useful when looking for a fluctuation theorem of additive functionals of the markov chain .",

    "the forces keeping the system out  of  equilibrium are the external force @xmath17 and the chemical potential difference @xmath18 associated to atp hydrolysis . in the last years , much attention have been devoted to the thermodynamics of small systems supported by very fast technological improvements ( see for example @xcite and references therein )",
    ". molecular motors are proteins working as motors at the nanoscale , with very interesting thermodynamic aspects , which have been much investigated both from a theoretical and an experimental viewpoint @xcite .",
    "the fluctuation theorem for molecular motors with two or three chemical states have been proved in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the small number of chemical states allows a detailed analysis based on matrix computations , leading to more information than the gallavotti  cohen ",
    "type symmetry for large deviations . in the general case ,",
    "matrix computations become not reasonable . on the other hand ,",
    "the developed theory for fluctuation theorems associated to cycle decompositions allows to easily prove in full generality the fluctuation relation obtained in @xcite for only two chemical states .",
    "more precisely , calling @xmath19 the position of the molecular motor along the filament and @xmath20 the atp consumption , it holds @xmath21 where , roughly speaking , the function @xmath22 is characterized by the identity @xmath23 and where @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the dimensionless quantities @xmath26 $ ] and @xmath27 $ ] ( @xmath28 $ ] being the length unit ) .",

    "finally , in section [ motorino ] we discuss the biochemical application of theorem [ basis ] leading to relation .",
    "as starting point , we extend the fluctuation theorem obtained in @xcite[section 2.3 ] . as in @xcite we consider a continuous  time markov chain @xmath32 on a finite state space @xmath33 having markov generator @xmath34 we assume that the markov chain is irreducible and that the transition rates satisfy the positivity relation @xmath35 the last assumption is very reasonable in physical systems , since for a real transition between physical states one expects that , at least with very low probability , the opposite transition is possible .",
    "we remark that , due to irreducibility and since @xmath33 is finite , there exists a unique stationary distribution of the markov chain .",

    "trivially , the above family @xmath49 corresponds to a representation of @xmath36 as sum of markov generators , since we can write @xmath50 where @xmath38 denotes the markov generator on @xmath33 defined as @xmath51 .",
    "we point out that our assumptions ( a1 ) , ( a2 ) , ( a3 ) coincide with the ones stated in @xcite[section 2.3 ] , with the only exception that here we have dropped the additional assumption of @xcite that , given @xmath52 , there exists at most one index @xmath53 such that @xmath54 .",

    "<S> we prove a fluctuation theorem for the coefficients in this decomposition . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting fluctuation theorem involves the cycle affinities , which in many real systems correspond to the macroscopic forces . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the above decomposition is useful when analyzing the large deviations of additive functionals of the markov chain . </S>",
    "<S> as example of application , in a very general context we derive a fluctuation relation for the mechanical and chemical currents of a molecular motor moving along a periodic filament .    </S>",
