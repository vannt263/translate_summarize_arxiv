    "shorter nanowires possess smaller kinetic inductance causing shorter reset time @xcite , therefore various nanophotonical methodologies were developed to enhance the absorption efficiency via short meandered superconducting patterns .",

    "in addition to this we have analyzed tendencies in configurations of four corresponding c - snspd type devices , which make possible to maximize the polarization contrast by gradually decreasing the criterion regarding the absorptance that have to be met parallel .",
