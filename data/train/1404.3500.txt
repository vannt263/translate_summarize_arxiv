    "the shell model indicates that the atomic nucleus is something like a small atom , the cluster model suggests that it is similar to a molecule , while the collective model says that it is a microscopic liquid drop .",
    "therefore , in order to understand the nuclear structure we need to study ( among others ) the interrelation of these models , find their common intersection , etc .",
    "the basic connections were found in the fifties .",
    "elliott @xcite showed how the quadrupole deformation and collective rotation can be derived from the spherical shell model : the states belonging to a collective band are determined by their specific su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "wildermuth and kanellopoulos @xcite ( following perring and skyrme @xcite ) established the relation between the shell and cluster models .",
    "they proved that the hamiltonians of the two models can be rewritten into each other exactly in the harmonic oscillator approximation .",
    "this relation results in a close connection between the corresponding eigenvectors , too : the wavefunction of one model is a linear combination of those of the other , which belong to the same energy . later on this relation",
    "was interpreted by bayman and bohr @xcite in terms of the su(3 ) symmetry . as a consequence ,",
    "the cluster states are also selected from the shell model space by their specific su(3 ) symmetries .",
    "( in fact only one kind of cluster states have this feature , and there are other kinds , too , as discussed later . )    we will refer to this interrelation among the three basic structure models as the su(3 ) connection . it was established in 1958 for a single major shell problem , for simple symmetries and small deformations of the ground - state region . in this paper",
    "we consider its extension to multi - major - shells , and in a following one the more general symmetries and the case of large deformations are considered @xcite .",
    "the concept is illustrated by the example of the @xmath2ne nucleus .",
    "the connection of the shell model and the cluster model is especially interesting due to the fact that both models have a complete set of basis states , i.e. any nuclear states can be expanded in both bases . depending on the simple or complicated nature of these expansions",
    "we can distinguish four different cases .",
    "i ) if it is simple in the shell basis , but complicated in the cluster one , then we can speak about a simple shell state , which is a poor cluster state .",

    "( later on we will refer to these states as rigid molecule - like cluster states . )",
    "iii ) the expansion may be simple in both bases .",
    "we call this situation as a shell - like cluster state .",
    "iv ) if it is complicated in both bases , than the state is not a simple one .",
    "of course it is not the name that matters .",
    "the important point is that there are three different kinds of simple states when we investigate them from the viewpoint of the cluster - shell competition .",
    "sometimes only the kind ii ) , i.e. rigid molecule - like states are considered as cluster states .",
    "the reason for our vocabulary , i.e. speaking about two kinds of cluster states : shell - like and molecule - like is inspired by their experimentally observable characteristics .",
    "both of them prefer a certain reaction channel , have a large cluster spectroscopic factor , etc .",
    "they represent two different quantum phases of the nucleus , as discussed in @xcite . by choosing these names we are in line with the general definition of a simple nuclear state in terms of experimental observation :",
    "a state is called simple if its wavefunction has a large overlap , or form a large matrix element with the wavefunction of a reaction channel , in which it can be observed @xcite .",

    "e.g. in case of @xmath2ne the @xmath41 ( 8,0 ) and the @xmath75 ( 9,0 ) states can be expressed only in a single shell model irrep , while for the more excited states the number of contributing shell model irreps are as follows , ( 10,0 ) : 5 , ( 11,0 ) : 12 , ( 12,0 ) : 34 ...    ne nucleus .",
    "the experimental bands are labelled by the @xmath80 , and the model states by the @xmath81 quantum numbers .",
    "( for more details see the text . )",
    "[ fig : spectrum],height=253 ]    as for the relation of the model spaces ( wavefunctions ) of the three basic structure models ( shell , collective and cluster models ) is considered the following can be said .",
    "when multi major shells are involved then the ( quadrupole ) collective or ( dipole ) cluster bands can be picked up from the microscopic shell model basis according to their u@xmath82(3 ) @xmath0 u@xmath83(3 ) @xmath21 u(3 ) symmetry .",
    "some irreducible representations are present in each of the three models .",
    "having the same su(3 ) basis , however , does not necessarily mean 100% overlap of the wavefunction , it can be less , too .",
    "this situation is similar to what was found for the single major shell problem in terms of the historical su(3 ) connection .",
    "another interesting question of the intersection of the different structure models is how their spectra compare to each other , when similar interactions applied . in this respect",
    "first we should note that the wildermuth - connection between the shell and cluster model states was found originally for harmonic oscillator hamiltonians ( with exact su(3 ) symmetry ) .",
    "the elliott - connection , on the other hand , between the shell and collective states is valid for more general interactions .",
    "in particular , it survives not only for the exactly su(3 ) symmetric hamiltonian , but also for the ones having a dynamical symmetry , which can be written in terms of the invariant operators of the su(3 ) @xmath21 so(3 ) algebra - chain .",
    "( sometimes it is called dynamically broken symmetry . ) in fact , however , the wildermuth - connection is also valid for this kind of more general interactions . in particular , the complete symmetry of the @xmath12-nucleon system",
    "is given by the u(3a ) @xmath21 u(3 ) @xmath0 u(a ) algebra , where u(3 ) refers to the space part , while u(a ) acts in the pseudo - space of the particle numbers .",
    "when the system is fully symmetric with respect to this latter one , then the shell - cluster connection is valid for the dynamically broken su(3 ) symmetry , too . for a recent discussion in details",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "if the hamiltonian is expressed in terms of the invariant operators of the group chain ( [ intersec ] ) then the energy - eigenvalue has an analytical solution i.e. a ( broken ) dynamical symmetry is present .",
    "this u@xmath82(3 ) @xmath0 u@xmath83(3 ) @xmath21 u(3 ) dynamical symmetry is the common intersection of the shell , collective and cluster models of multi major shells .",
    "figure 1 . shows a comparison between the experimental and the u(3 ) dynamically symmetric ( [ intersec ] ) spectrum of the @xmath2ne nucleus .",
    "the energy ( in mev ) was obtained with the formula @xmath84 the oscillator energy is determined according to the systematics @xcite , while @xmath85 is the moment of inertia calculated classically for the rigid shape determined by the u(3 ) quantum numbers .",
    "the parameters of the quadratic and the rotational terms were fitted to the experimental data .",
    "( the ground state energy is taken to be zero . )",
    "the @xmath86 transitions ( in w.u . ) were calculated with the operator @xmath87 the experimental data are from @xcite , and in the band - assignement the conclusions of @xcite were taken into account . ( the energies of the @xmath88 and @xmath89 states of the @xmath90 band are obtained as the average of two and three candidate states , respectively . )",
    "the purpose of this calculation is not to give a detailed description of the experimental data , rather to show how the common intersection of the three basic structure models compares to the experiment .",
    "the right panel in fig .",
    "1 . can be considered as a ( part of a ) shell , collective or cluster spectrum , when the basis states and the operators can be characterized by the su(3 ) ( and subgroup ) symmetries , i.e. for the case of the dynamical symmetry .",
    "these circumstances are similar again to tose of the single - shell problem .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the interrelation of the fundamental nuclear structure models , the shell , collective and cluster models from the viewpoint of symmetries .",
    "these models are based on different physical pictures , and their connection was established first in terms of the su(3 ) symmetry for a single shell problem @xcite .",
    "we have considered here the generalization of this relation along the major shell excitations .",
    "algebraic models have been constructed for the description of this vertical extension in each of the three approaches .",
    "the most relevant ones from the viewpoint of the symmetry - based interrelations are the symplectic shell model of sp(3,r ) algebraic structure @xcite , the contracted symplectic model of u@xmath37(6)@xmath0u@xmath36(3 ) , which is the large @xmath11 limit of the multi major - shell symplectic model @xcite , and the fully microscopic @xcite as well as the semimicroscopic algebraic cluster models @xcite , with u@xmath51(3)@xmath0u@xmath60(3 ) basis .",
    "the common intersection of these models is provided by the u@xmath82(3)@xmath0u@xmath83(3)@xmath21u(3 ) dynamical symmetry , i.e. for the many major - shell problem this symmetry substitutes the simple su(3 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows how the schematic spectrum of this dynamical symmetry , which can be considered as a shell , collective or cluster description , compares with the experimental one .",
    "this work was supported by the otka ( grant no k106035 ) , as well as by the mta - bas ( no . 7 ) and mta - jsps ( snk 6/2013 ) bilateral projects .",
