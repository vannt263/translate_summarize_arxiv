    "synchronization of interacting chaotic oscillators is one of the most interesting nonlinear phenomenon and is an inherent part of many natural systems  ( cf.@xcite ) .",
    "the concept of synchronization is receiving a central importance in recent research in nonlinear dynamics due to its potential applications in diverse areas of science and technology . since the identification of chaotic synchronization @xcite",
    ", several works have appeared in identifying and demonstrating basic kinds of synchronization both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "there are also attempts to find a unifying framework for defining the overall class of chaotic synchronizations @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting synchronization behaviors of unidirectionally coupled chaotic systems is the generalized synchronization ( gs ) , which was conceptually introduced in ref .",
    "generalized synchronization is observed in coupled nonidentical systems , where there exists some functional relation between the drive @xmath0 and the response @xmath1 systems , that is , @xmath2 . with gs",
    ", all the response systems coupled to the drive lose their intrinsic chaoticity ( sensitivity to initial conditions ) under the same driving and follow the same trajectory . hence the presence of gs",
    "can be detected using the so called auxiliary system approach @xcite , where an additional system ( auxiliary system ) identical to the response system is coupled to the drive in similar fashion .",
    "auxiliary system approach is particularly appealing since it can be implemented directly in an experiment and , in addition , this method allows one to utilize analytical approaches for studying gs .",
    "however , one has to be aware that if there are multiple basins of attraction for the coupled drive - response system , then the auxiliary system approach can fail .    generalized synchronization ( gs ) has been well studied and understood in systems with few degrees of freedom and for discrete maps  @xcite .",
    "the concept of gs has also been extended to spatially extended chaotic systems such as coupled ginzburg - landau equations  @xcite .",
    "recently , the terminology intermittent generalized synchronization ( igs ) @xcite was introduced in diffusively coupled rssler systems in analogy with intermittent lag synchronization ( ils ) @xcite and intermittent phase synchronization ( ips ) @xcite , and also experimentally in coupled chua s circuit .",
    "very recently , it has been shown @xcite that the transition to intermittent chaotic synchronization ( in the case of complete synchronization ) is characteristically distinct for geometrically different chaotic attractors .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that for phase coherent chaotic attractors ( rssler attractor ) the transition occurs immediately as soon as the coupling strength is increased from zero and for non - phase - coherent attractors ( lorenz attractor ) , the transition occurs slowly as the coupling is increased from zero .",
    "time - delay systems form an important class of dynamical systems and recently they are receiving central importance in investigating the phenomenon of chaotic synchronizations in view of their infinite dimensional nature and feasibility of experimental realization  @xcite .",
    "while the concept of gs has been well established in low dimensional systems , it has not yet been studied in detail in coupled time - delay systems and only very few recent studies have been dealt with gs in time - delay systems  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the mechanism of onset of gs in coupled time - delay systems and its characteristic properties have not yet been clearly understood and require urgent attention .    in this paper , we investigate the characteristic properties of nature of onset of gs from asynchronous state in unidirectionally coupled piece - wise linear time - delay systems exhibiting highly non - phase coherent hyperchaotic attractors  @xcite .",
    "we find that the onset of gs is preceded by on - off intermittency mechanism from the desynchronized state .",
    "we have also identified that the intermittency transition to gs exhibits characteristically distinct behaviors for different coupling schemes . in particular",
    ", the intermittency transition occurs in a broad range of coupling strength for error feedback coupling configurations and in a narrow range of coupling strength for direct feedback coupling configurations , beyond certain threshold value of coupling strength .",
    "in addition , the intermittent dynamics is characterized by periodic bursts away from the temporal synchronized state with period equal to the delay time of the response system in the case of broad range intermittency transition whereas it is characterized by random time intervals in the case of narrow range intermittency transition .",
    "we have also confirmed these dynamical behaviours in both linear and nonlinear coupling configurations .",
    "we have analyzed these transitions analytically using krasvoskii - lyapunov functional approach and numerically by the probability of synchronization and by the _ _ sub__lyapunov exponents .",
    "we have also addressed the reason behind these transitions using periodic orbit theory .",
