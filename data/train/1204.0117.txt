    ", we will prove that this singular problem can be approximated by a parabolic problem with nonlinear boundary conditions , where the oscillatory behavior of the neighborhood is captured as a flux condition and a potential term on the boundary .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the family of solutions @xmath46 will converge to a solution of an equation of the same type with nonlinear boundary condition on @xmath4 since @xmath34 is a thin strip `` approaching '' @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , we show that under certain conditions , the limit problem of ( [ 1 ] ) is the following parabolic problem with nonlinear boundary conditions @xmath47 where the boundary coefficient @xmath48 is related to the oscillating function @xmath29 and is given by @xmath49 as mentioned , we get a limit problem with a nonlinear boundary condition that captures the oscillatory behavior of the `` inner boundary '' of the set @xmath31 .",
    "this nonlinear boundary condition includes the function @xmath50 , the mean value of @xmath51 for each @xmath52 .",

    "we will show that they are continuous at @xmath1 . recall that an attractor is a compact invariant set which attracts all bounded sets of the phase space of a dynamical system .",
    "this kind of problem was initially studied in  @xcite , where linear elliptic equations were considered . there , the neighborhood is a strip of width @xmath0 and base in a portion of the boundary , without oscillatory behavior .",
    "later , the asymptotic behavior of a parabolic problem of the same type was analyzed in  @xcite , where the upper semicontinuity of attractors at @xmath1 was proved .",
    "the same technique of  @xcite has been used in  @xcite , where the results of  @xcite were extended to a reaction - diffusion problem with delay . in these works ,",
    "the boundary of the domain is smooth .",
    "recently , in  @xcite , some results of  @xcite were adapted to a nonlinear elliptic problem posed on a lipschitz domain @xmath53 presenting a highly oscillatory behavior on the neighborhood of the boundary using some ideas of  @xcite , where elliptic and parabolic problems defined in thin domains with a highly oscillatory behavior have been extensively studied .",
    "the goal of our work is to extend the results of  @xcite to a parabolic problem in which the `` inner boundary '' of @xmath31 presents a highly oscillatory behavior .",
    "moreover , assuming hyperbolicity of the equilibria of the limit problem , we also obtain results on the lower semicontinuity of the attractors .",

    "this enables us to cut the nonlinearity @xmath61 in such a way that it becomes bounded with bounded derivatives up to second order without changing the attractors .",
    "therefore , we may assume without loss of generality that    * @xmath54 is a @xmath22-function satisfying ( [ dissipative ] ) and @xmath62 for some constant @xmath63 .",
    "although we restrict our attention to nonlinearities independent of the spacial variable , the method can be easily adapted for the case @xmath64 depending on @xmath65 .",
    "it is worth to mention that we also can consider reactions occurring on the whole region , instead of concentrating on the boundary . in this case",
