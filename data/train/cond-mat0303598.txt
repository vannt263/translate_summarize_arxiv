    "phase transitions in random systems remain one of the important and only partially solved problems in statistical physics .",
    "originally , it was thought that even weak disorder destroys any critical point because the disordered system divides itself up into spatial regions which undergo the transition at different temperatures , leading to a smeared transition in which there would be no sharp singularities in thermodynamic quantities ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , it was soon found that classical continuous phase transitions are generically sharp in the presence of weak , short - range correlated disorder . if a clean critical fixed point ( fp ) fulfills the harris criterion @xcite @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the correlation length exponent and @xmath2 is the spatial dimensionality , the disorder decreases under coarse graining .",
    "the system becomes asymptotically homogeneous at large length scales .",
    "thus , the clean critical point is perturbatively stable against disorder , and the critical behavior of the random system is identical to that of the corresponding clean system .",
    "macroscopic observables are self - averaging at the critical point , i.e. , the relative width of their probability distributions goes to zero in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "even if the harris criterion is violated , the transition will generically remain sharp , but the critical behavior will be different from that of the clean system . depending on the fate of the disorder under coarse graining it can either be of finite or of infinite disorder type . in the first case the system remains inhomogeneous at all length scales with the relative strength of the inhomogeneities approaching a finite value for large length scales .",
    "these transitions are controlled by renormalization group ( rg ) fixed points with finite disorder .",
    "macroscopic observables are not self - averaging , the relative width of their probability distributions approaches a size - independent constant @xcite .",
    "examples of critical points in this class include the dilute three - dimensional ising model or classical spin glasses .",
    "the second case occurs when the relative magnitude of the inhomogeneities increases without limit under coarse graining .",
    "the corresponding fixed points are called infinite - disorder fixed points . here",
    ", the probability distributions of macroscopic variables become very broad ( on a logarithmic scale ) with the width increasing with system size .",
    "this can lead to activated rather than the usual power - law scaling at the critical point .",
    "a famous classical example of an infinite - disorder critical point occurs in the mccoy - wu model @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", another aspect of phase transitions in disordered systems , the griffiths phenomena , has regained a lot of attention .",
    "griffiths phenomena are non - perturbative effects of rare disorder fluctuations in the vicinity of a phase transition .",
    "they can be understood as follows : disorder in general decreases the critical temperature @xmath3 from its clean value @xmath4 . in the temperature region",
    "@xmath5 the system does not display global order .",
    "however , in an infinite system one will find arbitrarily large regions that are devoid of impurities with a small but non - zero probability .",
    "these rare regions or griffiths islands are locally in the ordered phase while the bulk system is still in the disordered phase .",
    "their fluctuations are very slow because flipping them requires changing the order parameter in a large volume .",
    "griffiths @xcite was the first to show that this leads to a non - analytic free energy everywhere in the region @xmath5 , which is now known as the griffiths phase @xcite or the griffiths region . in generic classical systems , the contribution of the griffiths singularities to thermodynamic ( equilibrium ) observables is very weak since the singularity in the free energy is only an essential one @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the consequences for the dynamics are much more severe with the rare regions dominating the behavior for long times . in the griffiths region",
    ", the spin autocorrelation function @xmath6 decays very slowly with time @xmath7 , like @xmath8 for ising systems @xcite , and like @xmath9 for heisenberg systems @xcite .",
    "more recently , these results have been confirmed by rigorous calculations for the equilibrium @xcite and dynamic @xcite properties of disordered ising models .    in many real systems ,",
    "the disorder is not generated by point - like defects but by dislocations or disordered layers or grain boundaries . often , extended impurities in a @xmath2-dimensional system can be modeled by disorder perfectly correlated in @xmath10 1 or 2 dimensions but uncorrelated in the remaining @xmath11 dimensions . while it is generally accepted that long - range disorder correlations increase the effects of the impurities , their influence on the phase transition has been controversial .",
    "early rg work @xcite based on a single expansion in @xmath12 did not produce a critical fixed point . this was interpreted as a smeared transition or a first order one @xcite . however , an additional expansion in the number @xmath13 of correlated dimensions @xcite cured this problem and gave rise to critical fixed points with conventional power - law scaling . further support for the sharp transition scenario came from monte - carlo simulations of a 3d ising model with planar defects @xcite .",
    "all the perturbative rg studies miss , however , the effects of rare regions and griffiths phenomena .",
    "these effects have been studied in detail in the already mentioned mccoy - wu model @xcite , a disordered 2d ising model in which the disorder is perfectly correlated in one dimension and uncorrelated in the other . the transition in this model was originally thought to be smeared .",
    "it was later found that it is sharp but of infinite - disorder type @xcite .",
    "similar behavior has been found in several random quantum systems which are related to classical systems with linear defects @xcite .",
    "based on these results it was believed for a long time that phase transitions generically remain sharp even in the presence of extended disorder .    in this paper",
    "we show , however , that this belief is not generally true .",
    "specifically , we show that for ising order parameter symmetry , planar defects destroy the sharp continuous phase transition via effects which are similar to but stronger than the usual griffiths phenomena : in systems with planar defects true _",
    "static long - range order _ can develop on isolated rare regions . as a result ,",
    "the order parameter is very inhomogeneous in space close to the smeared transition , and the thermodynamic order parameter depends exponentially on temperature . we also show that this disorder - induced smearing generically occurs in an entire class of transitions in systems with extended disorder .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rounding ] , the model is introduced , and the mechanism for the smearing of the transition is explained . in sec.[sec : lifshitz ] we use lifshitz tail arguments to determine the behavior in the tail of the rounded transition , i.e. , for a very low concentration of ordered islands .",
    "section [ sec : numerics ] is devoted to a numerical study of a three - dimensional infinite - range ising model which illustrates the smearing of the phase transition .",
    "finally , in sec.[sec : discussion ] we discuss the generality of the disorder - induced smearing , the relation to griffiths phenomena , favorable conditions for observing the smearing , and the influence of the order parameter symmetry .",
    "for definiteness we consider a @xmath2-dimensional @xmath14 theory with random-@xmath3 type disorder completely correlated in the @xmath15 directions @xmath16 and @xmath17 but uncorrelated in the remaining @xmath11 directions @xmath18 .",

    "@xmath22 is the projection of @xmath23 on the uncorrelated directions @xmath18 .",
    "we consider two different types of disorder . in the first type , poisson ( or dilution )",
    "disorder , @xmath21 is given by @xmath24\\ ] ] where @xmath25 are the random positions of planar impurities of spatial density @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is a non - negative short - ranged impurity potential .",
    "the second type of disorder is a gaussian distribution with zero mean and a correlation function @xmath28    now consider the effects of rare disorder fluctuations in this system : analogous to the griffiths phenomena , there is a small but finite probability for finding large spatial regions in @xmath29 direction which are more strongly coupled than the bulk system . for poisson disorder , these are regions devoid of impurities while for gaussian disorder it would be regions with a negative average @xmath30 .",
    "these rare regions can be locally in the ordered phase , even if the bulk system is still in the disordered phase . for poisson disorder which fulfills @xmath31",
    "this starts to happen right below the clean transition , i.e. , for @xmath32 @xcite while for the unbounded gaussian disorder , locally ordered rare regions exist for all @xmath7 .",
    "since the defects in our system are planar , the rare regions are infinite in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 directions but finite in the remaining directions .",
    "this is a crucial difference to systems with uncorrelated disorder , where the rare regions are finite objects ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] ) . in our system",
    ", each rare region is therefore equivalent to a two - dimensional ising system and can undergo a real phase transition _ independently _ of the rest of the system .",
    "thus , for planar defects , those rare regions which are in the ordered phase will develop a non - zero static order parameter which can be aligned by an infinitesimally small interaction or an infinitesimally small field .",
    "the resulting phase transition is very different from conventional continuous phase transitions , be it transitions controlled by clean or finite - disorder or even infinite - randomness fixed points . in all of those cases , which represent `` sharp '' phase transitions",
    ", a non - zero order parameter develops as a collective effect of the entire system , accompanied by a diverging correlation length in all directions .",
    "in contrast , in a system with planar defects , the order parameter develops very inhomogeneously in space with different parts of the system ( i.e. , different @xmath33 regions ) ordering independently at different @xmath7 .",
    "correspondingly , the correlation length in @xmath33 direction remains finite for all temperatures .",
    "this defines a smeared transition .",
    "we thus conclude that planar defects lead to a smearing of the phase transition .",
    "above , we have defined a smeared continuous phase transition via the behavior of correlation length .",
    "we now characterize it via the behavior of the free energy density or other global thermodynamic variables .",
    "two qualitatively different cases of smeared transitions must be distinguished .",
    "if the disorder distribution is unbounded in the sense that it permits regions with a local @xmath34 ( system ( [ eq : action ] ) with gaussian disorder falls into this class ) , the total ( average ) order parameter is non - zero for all temperatures , and the free energy density is analytic . in contrast , if the disorder distribution is bounded , there is a true paramagnetic phase with zero order parameter at high temperatures . at some temperature @xmath35 ,",
    "a non - zero order parameter starts to develop on rare spatial regions , accompanied by an essential singularity in the free energy density ( which stems from the probability for finding a rare region ) .",
    "this singularity is weaker than the power - law singularities at the sharp transitions mentioned above . the model ( [ eq : action ] ) with poisson disorder falls into this second class , with @xmath35 being identical to the critical temperature of the pure system .",
    "in this section we use extremal statistics to derive the leading thermodynamic behavior in the tail of the smeared transition , i.e. , in the parameter region where a few islands have developed static order but their density is so small that they can be treated as independent .",
    "the approach is similar to that of lifshitz @xcite and others for the description of the tails in the electronic density of states .",
    "we first consider the poisson type of disorder and later describe the differences for gaussian disorder .",
    "the probability @xmath36 of finding a large region of linear size @xmath37 ( in @xmath33-space ) devoid of any impurities is , up to pre - exponential factors , given by @xmath38 as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : rounding ] , such a rare region develops static long - range order at some @xmath39 below the clean critical point @xmath40 .",
    ", for the clean critical reduced temperature . for our purpose , the distinction between the bare and the renormalized @xmath7 is of no importance . ]",
    "the value of @xmath39 varies with the size of the region : the largest islands develop long - range order closest to the clean critical point .",
    "finite size scaling ( for the clean system , because the island is devoid of impurities ) yields @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the finite - size scaling shift exponent and @xmath43 is the amplitude for the crossover from @xmath2 dimensions to a slab geometry infinite in two dimensions but finite in @xmath44 dimensions . combining ( [ eq : wlr ] ) and",
    "( [ eq : fss ] ) we obtain the probability for finding a rare region which becomes critical at @xmath45 as @xmath46 where the constant @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 .",
    "the total ( or average ) order parameter @xmath49 is obtained by integrating over all rare regions which are ordered at @xmath7 , i.e. , all rare regions having @xmath50 .",
    "since the functional dependence on @xmath7 of the order parameter on a given island is of power - law type it does not enter the leading exponentials but only the pre - exponential factors .",
    "therefore we obtain to exponential accuracy @xmath51 the homogeneous magnetic susceptibility consists of two different contributions , one from the islands on the verge of ordering and one from the bulk system still deep in the disordered phase .",
    "the bulk system provides a finite , noncritical background susceptibility throughout the tail region of the smeared transition . in order to estimate the contribution of the islands consider the onset of local ordering at the clean critical temperature @xmath40 . using ( [ eq : w - dilute ] ) for the density of the islands we can estimate @xmath52 which is finite because the exponentially decreasing island density overcomes the power - law divergence of the susceptibility of an individual island . here",
    "@xmath53 is the clean susceptibility exponent and @xmath54 is related to a lower cutoff for the island size .",
    "once ordered islands exist they produce an effective background magnetic field everywhere in space which cuts off any possible divergence .",
    "therefore we conclude that the homogeneous magnetic susceptibility does not diverge anywhere in the tail region of the smeared transition .",
    "however , there is an essential singularity at the clean critical point produced by the vanishing density of ordered islands .",
    "the spatial magnetization distribution in the tail of the smeared transition is very inhomogeneous . on the already ordered islands ,",
    "the local order parameter @xmath55 is of the same order of magnitude as in the clean system .",
    "away from these islands it decays exponentially with the distance from the nearest island",
    ". the probability distribution @xmath56 $ ] will therefore be very broad , ranging from @xmath57 on the largest islands to @xmath58 on sites very far away from an ordered island .",
    "the _ typical _ local order parameter @xmath59 can be estimated from the typical distance of any point to the nearest ordered island . from ( [ eq : w - dilute ] ) we obtain @xmath60 at this distance from an ordered island , the local order parameter has decayed to @xmath61~ \\label{eq : mtyp}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the bulk correlation length ( which is finite and changes slowly throughout the tail region of the smeared transition ) and @xmath63 is constant .",
    "a comparison with ( [ eq : m - dilute ] ) gives the relation between @xmath59 and the thermodynamic order parameter @xmath49 , @xmath64 thus , @xmath59 decays exponentially with @xmath49 indicating an extremely broad local order parameter distribution . in order to determine the functional form of the local order parameter distribution ,",
    "first consider a situation with just a single ordered island at the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "for large distances @xmath23 the magnetization falls off exponentially like @xmath65 .",

    "it is important to distinguish effects of a finite size @xmath77 in the correlated directions and a finite size @xmath78 in the uncorrelated directions .",
    "if @xmath78 is finite but @xmath77 is infinite static order on the rare regions can still develop . in this case",
    ", the sample contains only a finite number of islands of a certain size .",
    "as long as the number of relevant islands is large , finite size - effects are governed by the central limit theorem . however , for @xmath79 very large and rare islands are responsible for the order parameter .",
    "the number @xmath80 of islands which order at @xmath45 behaves like @xmath81 .",
    "when @xmath80 becomes of order one , strong sample - to - sample fluctuations arise . using ( [ eq : w - dilute ] ) for @xmath82",
    "we find that strong sample to sample fluctuations start at @xmath83 thus , finite size effects are suppressed only logarithmically .",
    "analogously , one can study the onset of static order in a sample of finite size @xmath78 ( i.e. , the ordering temperature of the largest rare region in this sample ) . for small sample size @xmath78 , the probability distribution @xmath84 of the sample ordering temperatures",
    "@xmath45 will be broad because some samples do not contain any large islands . with increasing sample size",
    "the distribution becomes narrower and moves towards the clean @xmath85 because more samples contain large islands .",
    "the maximum @xmath45 coincides with @xmath85 corresponding to a sample without impurities .",
    "the lower cutoff corresponds to an island size so small that essentially every sample contains at least one of them .",
    "consequently , the width of the distribution of critical temperatures in finite - size samples is governed by the same relation as the onset of the fluctuations , @xmath86    we now turn to finite - size effects produced by a finite extension @xmath77 of the system in the correlated directions . in this case , the true static order on the rare regions is destroyed . whether or not the system develops long - range order depends on the number @xmath87 of uncorrelated dimensions .",
    "if @xmath88 no static long - range order can develop , i.e. the transition is rounded by conventional finite size effects _ in addition _ to the disorder - induced smearing .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath89 a true phase transition is possible but requires a finite interaction between the islands of the order of the temperature .",
    "this restores a _ sharp _ phase transition at a reduced temperature @xmath90 . to estimate the relation between @xmath77 and @xmath90 we note that the interaction between two planar rare regions of linear size @xmath77 is proportional to @xmath91 and decays exponentially with their spatial distance @xmath92 , @xmath93 , where @xmath62 is the bulk correlation length . with the typical distance given by ( [ eq : rtyp ] )",
    "we obtain a double exponential dependence between @xmath77 and the critical reduced temperature @xmath90 : @xmath94      in this subsection we apply lifshitz tail arguments to the case of @xmath95-correlated gaussian disorder @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the positive definite poisson disorder , the gaussian disorder is unbounded for @xmath96 .",

    "this leads to @xmath103 this implies that small but very deep fluctuations are responsible for the tail of the smeared transition ( in contrast to poisson disorder where the tail is produced by the largest islands ) . inserting into ( [ eq : ptcl ] ) gives the desired probability as a function of @xmath45 , @xmath104 where @xmath105 is a constant .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath106 , the main contribution comes from arbitrarily small islands . in this case",
    "the @xmath95-correlated disorder is unphysical and should be replaced by a distribution with a finite correlation length .",
    "the resulting @xmath82 is then purely gaussian . in the following",
    "we will not consider this case .",
    "starting from ( [ eq : w - gauss ] ) , one can derive the leading behavior in the tail of the smeared transition ( @xmath107 ) .",

    "the relation between @xmath77 and @xmath45 is double - exponential : @xmath110 a comparison of the results for gaussian and poisson disorder shows that the functional form of the thermodynamic relations at the smeared transition depends on the form of the disorder and is thus not universal .",
    "to illustrate the smearing of the phase transition we now show results from a numerical simulation of a 3d ising model with planar bond defects , i.e. , @xmath15 and @xmath88 . as discussed above , the smearing of the phase transition is the result of exponentially rare events .",
    "therefore large system sizes are required to observe it . in order to reach sufficiently large sizes with a reasonable effort and to retain the possibility of static order on an isolated rare region , we consider a model with infinite - range interactions in the correlated directions ( parallel to the defects ) but short - range interactions in the uncorrelated direction ( perpendicular to the defect planes ) .",
    "while the infinite - range model will not be quantitatively comparable to a short - range model , it provides a simple example for the rounding mechanism introduced in sec.[sec : rounding ] .",
    "moreover , since the rounding mechanism only depends on the existence of static order on the rare regions but not on any details , we expect that the results will qualitatively valid for a short - range model , too ( with the appropriate changes to the exponents in the relations derived in sec .",
    "[ sec : lifshitz ] ) . indeed , preliminary results @xcite of monte - carlo simulations of a 3d short - range ising model with planar defects fully agree with this expectation .",
    "the hamiltonian considered in this section reads @xmath111 here @xmath112 are the integer - valued coordinates of the ising spins .",

    "@xmath122 , i.e. , very strong defects .",
    "the fact that one can independently vary concentration and strength of the defects in an easy way is the main advantage of this binary disorder distribution .",

    "sometimes several 1000 iterations were necessary .",

    "the distribution is dominated by an exponential decay towards small magnetization values ( i.e. , towards negative @xmath74 ) with the decay constant decreasing with increasing temperature . however , once the system enters the rare - region dominated tail region of the smeared transition ( which , as can be seen from figures [ fig : magnetization_ab ] and [ fig : log_comp ] , happens roughly at @xmath165 for @xmath145 ) the behavior changes : in agreement with ( [ eq : plogm ] ) the probability distribution @xmath160 becomes constant except for a peak at large magnetization values which we attribute to the behavior of @xmath133 _ on _ the ordered islands ( eq .",

    "to summarize , we have shown that true static order can develop on an isolated rare region in an ising model with planar defects . as a result ,",
    "different parts of the system undergo the phase transition at different temperatures , i.e. , the sharp transition is smeared by the defects . in this final section",
    "we discuss the generality of our findings and their relation to griffiths phenomena and the harris criterion .",
    "we also discuss favorable conditions for observing the smearing in experiments or simulations .",
    "the origins of the smearing of the phase transition introduced in this paper and of griffiths phenomena are very similar , both are caused by rare large spatial regions which are locally in the ordered phase .",
    "the difference between the two effects is a result of disorder correlations . for uncorrelated or short - range correlated disorder ,",
    "the rare regions are of finite size .",
    "thus , they can not develop true static long - range order .",
    "instead , the order parameter fluctuates slowly leading to the griffiths singularities @xcite discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] .",
    "in contrast , if the rare regions are infinite in at least two dimensions , a stronger effect occurs : the rare regions which are locally in the ordered phase actually develop true static order , and this leads to a smeared transition . in other words ,",
    "the same rare regions which would usually produce griffiths singularities are responsible for the smearing of the transition in a system with planar defects .",
    "the tail of the smeared transition stretches to where the griffiths temperature would normally be , i.e. , to @xmath179 for gaussian disorder or @xmath180 for poisson disorder .",
    "so , the smeared transition replaces not only the conventional critical point but also the griffiths phase .",
    "we now discuss under which conditions a phase transition will be smeared by disorder .",
    "the arguments given in sec .",
    "[ sec : rounding ] in favor of a smeared transition only relied on the dimensionality of the rare regions and the order parameter symmetry .",
    "it is therefore expected that all phase transitions with discrete order parameter symmetry are smeared by quenched disorder if the defects are perfectly correlated in at least two dimensions . in systems with linear defects",
    "the transition will remain sharp if the interactions are short - ranged .",
    "however , if the interactions in the correlated direction fall of as @xmath181 or slower , even linear defects can lead to smearing because a 1d ising model with @xmath181 interaction has an ordered phase @xcite .",
    "this is particularly important @xcite for quantum phase transitions in itinerant electronic systems which can be mapped onto classical systems with @xmath182 interaction in imaginary time direction .",
    "phase transitions with continuous order parameter symmetry are more stable against smearing . in systems with short - range interactions",
    "the dimensionality of the defects has to be at least three , and in systems with linear or planar defects long - range interactions are required for smearing .",
    "it is known @xcite that classical xy and heisenberg systems in dimensions @xmath183 develop long - range order at finite @xmath127 only if the interaction falls off more slowly than @xmath184 .",
    "consequently , in a system with linear defects the phase transition will only be smeared if the interactions in defect direction fall off more slowly than @xmath181 ( or more slowly than @xmath185 for planar defects ) .    a third important question concerns the universality of the thermodynamic behavior in the vicinity of the smeared transition .",
    "as can be seen from comparing the results of poisson and gaussian disorder , the functional dependence of the magnetization and other observables on the temperature is _ not _ universal , it depends on details of the disorder distribution .",
    "therefore , only the presence or absence of smearing is universal in the sense of critical phenomena ( i.e. , depending on dimensionality and symmetry only ) while the thermodynamic relations are non - universal .",
    "our fourth remark deals with the relation of the disorder - induced smearing and the harris criterion which in the case of extended defects reads @xcite @xmath186 .",
    "we emphasize that the phase transition can be smeared by planar defects even if the corresponding clean critical point fulfills the harris criterion and appears to be stable .",
    "the reason is that the harris criterion assumes a _ homogeneous _ transition and studies the behavior of the coarse - grained ( root - mean - square ) disorder at large length scales .",
    "however , the formation of static order on an isolated finite - size rare region is a non - perturbative finite - length scale effect in the tail of the disorder distribution .",
    "this type of effects is not covered by the harris criterion .",
    "we now turn to the question which conditions are favorable for the _ observation _ of the smearing in experiments or simulations .",
    "a significant number of large rare regions will only exist if the defect concentration is small , as can be seen from ( [ eq : w - dilute ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the impurities have to be sufficiently strong so that the bulk system is still far away from criticality when the first rare regions start to order .",
    "thus , the most favorable type of disorder for the observation of the smearing is a small density of strong impurities .",
    "in contrast , for weak impurities the rounding is restricted to a very narrow temperature range below the clean critical temperature and maybe masked by the remainder of the bulk critical fluctuations .",
    "if the impurity concentration is too high , the exponential drop - off is very fast making it very hard to observe the smearing .",
    "this may also explain why no smearing was observed in earlier simulations . specifically , in ref .  @xcite weak impurities ( @xmath187 ) of a high concentration @xmath140 were used . these are unfavorable conditions , and the maximum system size of @xmath188 used in this simulation was probably too small to observe the smearing .    finally , we add one remark about the extreme tail of the smeared transition . in this parameter region , the ordered islands are very far apart and the aligning effect of the direct island - island interactions is very weak .",
    "it is therefore possible that in a real system other interactions play an important role in determining the relative orientation of the order parameter on the islands .",
    "this could lead , e.g. , to spin glass order in the extreme tail of the smeared transition .    in conclusion",
    ", perfect disorder correlations in one or more directions dramatically increase the effects of the disorder on a phase transition with discrete order parameter symmetry .",
    "- dimensional defects typically lead to a conventional critical point with power - law scaling . for linear defects",
    "the generic behavior seems to be an infinite - randomness critical point @xcite while we have shown here that planar defects generically destroy the sharp transition by smearing .",
