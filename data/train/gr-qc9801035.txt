    "the final stage of black hole evaporation and associated problem have attracted much theoretical attention since the evaporation process is discovered by hawking@xcite .",
    "although various suggestions have been proposed in the past , serious theoretical treatments have started in 1992 by callan , giddings , harvey and strominger(cghs ) @xcite using a toy model in two - dimensional dilaton gravity coupled with conformal matter .",
    "they have shown that their model(hence force called cghs model ) is able to describe the formation of a black hole and hawking radiation . moreover",
    "the backreaction of the metric is analyzed to leading order in a 1/n expansion , where n is the number of matter fields .",
    "static solutions are also found in the cghs model which is supposed to describe a black hole in equilibrium with a bath of hawking radiation@xcite .    stimulated by their work , various models of two - dimensional dilaton gravity are investigated@xcite . among them",
    "lowe studied an interesting model which is obtained by the dimensional reduction of the four - dimensional einstein action@xcite . in his treatment",
    "the two - dimensional matter is coupled to the model to allow the backreaction in the same way as the cghs model .",
    "lowe has also obtained static models which correspond to infinite mass black holes supported by an incoming flux of radiation just like the static solution of the cghs model .",
    "these static solutions are of some interest because the evaporation of a large mass black hole may be well approximated by a succession of these solutions .    in spite of their importance in understanding the evaporation process ,",
    "the stability analysis of these static solutions in the cghs model as well as lowe s model have not been made .",
    "we mean stability in the following sense .",
    "the static solutions mentioned above are actually the background configuration in a pure state defined by the effective action . if one would like to think of a quantum black hole in equilibrium with a thermal bath , one has to take the thermal state and thermal fluctuations will inevitably present . then the question arises naturally if the static black holes are stable against such fluctuations .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to address this question , and to perform a stability analysis for the quantum black hole .",
    "two - dimension will be an unique place to be able to do it in an explicit way .",
    "here we shall take lowe s model as our example .",
    "our method is completely general and applicable to any models .",
    "it is also important to realize that the instability discussed here has nothing to do with thermal instability due to the negative heat capacity in the case of the four - dimensional evaporating black hole in a thermal bath@xcite .",
    "in fact the hawking temperature of the two - dimensional black hole is independent of the mass , and thus there will be no possibility to have thermal instability in our case .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we review the static solutions in lowe s model in section 2",
    ". then we shall derive linear perturbation around the static solutions in section 3 .",
    "there we shall show that the perturbed variable obeys the wave equation with potential .",
    "we also show that the potential is negative near the horizon . in section 4",
    "we also perform numerical analysis to confirm that the potential is negative definite and there will be at least one unstable mode .",
    "some discussions are devoted in section 5 .",
    "we shall first review lowe s model and its static solutions .",
    "his model is obtained by the dimensional reduction of the four - dimensional einstein gravity . here",
    "we shall consider the following action .",
    "@xmath3 where the coupling constant @xmath4 is determined by the number of matter fields @xmath5 as @xmath6 the above action reduces to lowe s action when @xmath7 .",
    "we shall not specify any particular value for @xmath8 in our analysis below .",
    "we shall take the following form of the metric @xmath9 then the equation of motion may be written as @xmath10 the constraint equations are @xmath11         +   { \\textstyle \\frac{1}{2}}(\\partial_{\\pm}f)^{2 }   \\nonumber \\\\",

    "we are interested in the static solution of the above set of equations which corresponds to a black hole in equilibrium with hawking radiation .",
    "the above equations of motion([em1]-[em3 ] ) take the following forms in the static situation in the new coordinates ; @xmath15 also the constraint equation([cnst ] ) becomes @xmath16   .",

    "we have investigated the dynamical instability of a quantum black hole in two - dimensional dilaton gravity .",
    "the unperturbed solutions are taken as the static solutions describing a black hole with quantum correction and with incoming flux of radiation .",
    "the quantum backreaction is essential to have such static configurations .",
    "we have found a surprising result that static solutions found by lowe in his model are dynamically unstable for linear perturbations .",
    "this will mean that lowe s model is not appropriate for the study of black hole evaporation unless some nonlinear mechanism to stabilize the solution is present.it can be also shown that the static solutions generated also by quantum backreaction in cghs model are dynamically unstable .",
    "these examples strongly suggest that the stability analysis of quantum black hole model should be performed for each model of two - dimensional dilaton gravity , before withdrawing any physical conclusions using such models . in this sense",
    "it is interesting to see the situation in more general two - dimensional models @xcite which allows to have black hole configurations .",
    "particularly it would be interesting to investigate the stability of the models derived entirely from higher - dimensional theories by busso and hawking@xcite .",
    "finally it should be mentioned that our study opens up also a new interesting possibility to have some stable bounded modes outside the horizon for certain models of two - dimensional dilaton gravity .",
