    "the variation of the space densities and properties of quasars with redshift contains information about structure formation and evolution at different epochs .",
    "radio galaxies are important for similar reasons and their relationship with radio - loud quasars ( rlqs ) is now under scrutiny . according to orientation - based unified schemes , rlqs and powerful radio galaxies are the same type of objects , their apparently different properties being due to a systematic difference in the angle between our line - of - sight and the radio jet axis ( e.g. scheuer 1987 , antonucci 1993 ) . in orientation - based unification , the broad line region and quasar nucleus",
    "are hidden in radio galaxies behind an optically - thick torus .",
    "if there is not a sharp cut - off in the optical depth of the torus , then objects close to the transition angle between radio galaxies and quasars may appear to be faint reddened quasars ( baker 1997 ) .",
    "one of the major problems in trying to understand the collective properties of a sample of objects is ensuring that the sample provides reliable information on the parent population . particularly in astrophysics",
    ", care must be taken to minimise and understand selection effects .",
    "for example , because of the steepness of the radio luminosity function , there is a strong correlation between radio luminosity and redshift in the 3crr sample ( laing , riley & longair 1983 , hereafter lrl ) .",
    "hence , it is impossible to disentangle correlations with radio luminosity from those with evolution with a single flux - limited sample .",
    "radio quasar samples selected at high - frequency contain mostly flat - spectrum quasars ( fsqs , @xmath14 ) , where @xmath15 is evaluated at 1 ghz in the source rest - frame .",
    "the radio emission from these objects is often dominated by optically - thick radio cores , which are enhanced by doppler boosting because their jet axes lie close to the line - of - sight . therefore their total radio flux - densities ( and hence probability of being above a given flux - limit ) are orientation - dependent and often strongly time variable ( e.g. seielstad , pearson & readhead 1983 ) .",
    "in contrast , the radio emission from steep - spectrum quasars ( ssqs , @xmath16 ) is dominated by optically - thin extended emission and hence low - frequency selected samples suffer far less greatly from these orientation - dependent or variability biases .",
    "some radio sources , particularly compact - steep spectrum ( css ) sources ( e.g. fanti et al . 1995 ) and giga - hertz peaked spectrum ( gps ) sources ( e.g. odea , baum & stanghellini 1991 ) , suffer synchrotron self - absorption at low - frequencies and hence have radio spectra which flatten at low - frequency , eg .",
    "151 mhz . by evaluating the spectral indices at rest - frame 1 ghz we avoid rejecting these source from our sample ,",
    "although the sensitivity of a survey to such sources is clearly a function of both survey frequency and source redshift ( see blundell , rawlings & willott 1998a ( paper iv ) for a fuller discussion ) .    the luminosity function describes the co - moving density of a class of objects as a function of redshift and luminosity . for quasars",
    ", one can define the luminosity function in terms of the optical luminosity function ( olf ) , x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) , or the radio luminosity function ( rlf ) .",
    "most large quasar surveys have been selected using optical , and more recently x - ray , criteria so the quasar olf and xlf are better constrained than the rlf .",
    "boyle , shanks & peterson ( 1988 ) showed that the olf can be fitted with a broken power - law with the break luminosity evolving with redshift  an effect normally termed pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) .",
    "however , hewett , foltz & chaffee ( 1993 ) and miller et al .",
    "( 1993 ) showed that ple was an inadequate model to explain the evolution of luminous quasars .",
    "hawkins & vron ( 1995 ) explained the break in the power - law of boyle et al .",
    "as due to incompleteness in their data .",
    "hewett et al .",
    "proposed that the power - law index of the olf steepens as the redshift increases .",
    "this is supported by the recent analysis of the quasar olf by goldschmidt & miller ( 1998 ) .",
    "the space density of the most luminous quasars shows little or no evolution ( miller et al . 1993 ) , whilst the optically fainter quasars show significant evolution ( a factor of @xmath17 increase between @xmath18 ) .",
    "the xlf also appears to have a broken power - law form ( maccacaro et al .",
    "1991 ; della ceca et al .",
    "boyle et al .",
    "( 1994 ) find the best - fitting model for the xlf is pure luminosity evolution for @xmath19 and a constant co - moving density at higher redshift .",
    "however , it must be remembered that these quasar samples selected in the optical and x - ray wavebands may be prone to selection effects . if , for example , many quasars are highly reddened ( webster et al .",
    "1995 ) , then this would greatly alter the shape and evolution of the olf , and because of absorption by neutral hydrogen , the xlf .",
    "one of the difficulties of determining the quasar rlf is that radio surveys typically contain mostly radio galaxies , so all sources must be reliably identified as quasar or radio galaxy .",
    "dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ) derived the rlf separately for flat- and steep - spectrum radio sources .",
    "however , the high selection frequency ( 2.7 ghz ) of the samples used in this work meant a large fraction of flat - spectrum sources in their study and hence the steep - spectrum rlf was more poorly constrained .",
    "the steep - spectrum rlf fit of dunlop & peacock includes both radio galaxies and steep - spectrum quasars .",
    "no attempt was made to separate these different types of object .",
    "hence the steep - spectrum _ quasar _ rlf has not previously been well - constrained .",
    "radio selected quasar samples usually have additional optical selection criteria , which can be a cause of incompleteness and selection biases . since the 7c quasar sample has no optical selection criteria it is complete ,",
    "so in conjunction with the 3crr sample of lrl it can be used to derive the rlf for the low - frequency selected population which is dominated by ssqs .",
    "there have been several suggestions of correlations between the radio and optical properties of agn . the close relationship between narrow - line luminosity and low - frequency radio luminosity ( e.g. baum & heckman 1989 ; rawlings & saunders 1991 ; willott et al .",
    "1998b ( paper iii ) ) suggests a physical link between these two properties .",
    "correlations between the radio and optical luminosities of rlqs have been found ( e.g. browne & murphy 1987 ) but incompleteness worries mean that there are unknown selection effects which could affect the results .",
    "correlations between the radio and optical may be due to orientation - dependent emission ( e.g. baker 1997 ) .",
    "this is a problem for flat - spectrum rlq samples because often the radio luminosities are dominated by a doppler - boosted core and the optical luminosities too may therefore be orientation - dependent ( e.g. wills & lynds , 1978 ; browne & wright 1985 ) .",
    "serjeant et al .",
    "( 1998 ) presented evidence for a radio - optical correlation for ssq samples .",
    "they used the 3crr sample and a sample based on cross - matching the low - frequency ( 408 mhz ) mrc radio catalogue with apm data - the maqs sample .",
    "this sample has an optical magnitude limit as well as a radio flux limit .",
    "they also calculated @xmath20-band absolute magnitudes using observed @xmath20 magnitudes and @xmath21-corrections . for high - redshift quasars",
    ", this radiation was emitted in the uv and so will be greatly diminished if there is significant reddening of the quasar spectrum by dust .",
    "excepting 3crr , all other ssq samples also have optical magnitude limits , usually in the blue part of the spectrum ( e.g. vigotti et al . 1997 ; riley et al .",
    "hence faint ( and/or reddened ) quasars can be missed in these samples .",
    "if a substantial fraction of quasars are reddened then quasar samples with bright magnitude limits will miss them and an unrepresentative sample of the quasar population ( i.e. only the ` naked ' optically - bright ones ) is seen .",
    "the only way to be sure of avoiding these selection effects is to identify _ all _ the radio sources in a flux - limited sample .",
    "however , this can be very time consuming because most radio samples are dominated by radio galaxies , not quasars .    here",
    "we present a complete sample of 24 quasars from the new 7c redshift survey . in this survey",
    "we have obtained optical spectra of every radio source in two patches of sky ( whose total area covers 0.013 sr ) , with a 151 mhz flux density @xmath0 jy .",
    "we made high - resolution vla maps of these sources to ensure reliable optical identifications .",
    "all 77 radio sources have optical / near - infrared identifications and only 6 lack secure spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "all 6 of these are galaxies with estimated redshifts from multi - colour photometry .",
    "hence we can be confident that there is no significant incompleteness in our sample of radio - loud quasars .",
    "the layout of this paper ( paper ii ) is as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the data on the complete 7c quasar sample . in section 3",
    "we discuss our definition of a quasar in order to ensure that we are comparing similar types of objects from the 3crr and 7c samples .",
    "this is necessary because the traditional definition of a quasar is no longer tenable in the light of unified schemes .",
    "the rlq radio luminosity function is derived in section 4 and compared with the optically - selected quasar olf . in section 5",
    "we discuss the evidence for a correlation between the optical and radio luminosities of steep - spectrum quasars .",
    "in section 6 we use our knowledge of the radio - optical correlation and the rlq rlf to estimate the completeness of quasar samples selected with low - frequency radio and optical flux limits .",
    "the optical properties of the 7c quasar sample are to be discussed elsewhere ( willott et al . in prep .",
    ", paper viii ) .",
    "also in this forthcoming paper , we investigate the amount of reddening in the 7c quasar sample and its impact on the completeness of quasar surveys ."
