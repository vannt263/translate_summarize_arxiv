    "quantum graphs serve as mathematical models of mesoscopic networks built from thin nano - sized wires .",
    "such wires can be made of semiconductors , carbon and other materials .",
    "with respect to the current rapid development of nanotechnologies , quantum graphs have a considerable application potential . theoretical literature on the subject is now very extensive  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on the use of quantum graphs for a design of quantum devices that allow to control the transmission of an electron along a line according to its energy .",
    "various types of filtering capabilities of quantum graphs are known already for some time .",
    "one of the simplest such examples is the @xmath3-interaction on a line , which works as a high - pass filter .",
    "there exist also devices built upon graphs with more edges .",
    "for instance , it has been shown that a star graph with three arms and a properly chosen point interaction in the vertex can work as a high - pass / low - pass junction  @xcite . very recently",
    ", a star graph with three edges coupled together by a scale - invariant point interaction has been used to design a controllable band - pass spectral filter  @xcite .",
    "its controllability is achieved by an external potential on one of the edges .",
    "this construction has been generalized to quantum filters with multiple outputs and with multiple controllers  @xcite .",
    "there exist also different designs , e.g. , a special trident filter  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider transmission characteristics of a graph built from four `` components '' : an `` input '' half line , an `` output '' half line , a graph @xmath0 , and a certain special scale - invariant point interaction . both the half lines are attached to the graph @xmath0 in one of its vertices , and these three objects are coupled together by the scale - invariant interaction .",
    "after the preliminaries in section  [ section : preliminaries ] , we study , in section  [ section : main ] , the transmission along the input  output line of the graph in question .",
    "we find that the transmission characteristics show a strong resonance behavior at energies belonging to the spectrum of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the graph can be regarded as a band - pass spectral filter with narrow peak passbands .",
    "however , it is a slight abuse of terminology to call the graph `` filter '' , because the passbands are not of an interval - type , but of a peak - type around the resonance energies .",
    "naturally , this approach enables the design of spectral resonance filters with various characteristics , depending on the chosen graph @xmath0 .",
    "section  [ section : loop ] illustrates the result with an example .",
    "we choose @xmath0 as a loop placed in a magnetic field @xmath4 .",
    "the strength of @xmath4 determines the spectrum of @xmath0 via a simple formula , and , in consequence , it directly controls the passbands of the filter .",
    "therefore , the device can be used as a spectral filter controllable by an external magnetic field .",
    "the resonance behavior of the proposed filter essentially relies on the scale - invariant vertex coupling .",
    "since the physical interpretation of this coupling is not straighforward , we devote section  [ section : approximation ] to an explanation how to obtain it approximately by a use of several @xmath3-interactions , which are better understood .",
    "it turns out that there exist other special scale - invariant couplings that enable the construction of quantum devices with other interesting characteristics .",
    "we discuss two such examples in sections  [ section : inverse ] and [ section : switch ] . in section  [ section : inverse ] we find a scale - invariant coupling that allows to build a band - stop resonance filter with stopbands located at the energies belonging to the spectrum of @xmath0 .",
    "in other words , its transmission characteristics are complementary to the characteristics of the filter designed in section  [ section : main ] .",
    "in section  [ section : switch ] we consider a device with two outputs that works as a spectral separator . broadly speaking , particles with energies outside the spectrum of @xmath0",
    "are transmitted to output 1 , while particles with energies from the spectrum of @xmath0 are transmitted to output 2 .",
    "if the spectrum of @xmath0 is governed by an external field , the device can be used as a controllable switch or spectral junction .",
    "let @xmath0 be a graph , @xmath5 denote the set of its vertices and @xmath6 the set of its edges .",
    "we assume that @xmath0 is a metric graph , i.e. , every edge @xmath7 has its length @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath9 is the cardinality of @xmath6 , then the wave function of a particle on @xmath0 has @xmath9 components : @xmath10 , where the superscript @xmath11 stands for the transposition .",
    "let there be scalar potentials @xmath12 and vector potentials @xmath13 on the graph edges .",
    "the hamiltonian of a particle on @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath14 , acts as @xmath15 for @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the mass of the particle and @xmath18 is its charge .    in order to make the operator @xmath14 self - adjoint",
    ", it is necessary to impose proper boundary conditions in the graph vertices .",
    "let @xmath19 be a vertex of degree @xmath20 and @xmath21 be the wave function components at the edges incident to @xmath22 .",
    "if @xmath23 are the limits of those components in the vertex @xmath22 and @xmath24 are the limits of their derivatives in @xmath22 , taken in the outgoing sense , we denote @xmath25 the boundary conditions at every vertex @xmath22 couple @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the way @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath4 are complex @xmath30 matrices such that  @xcite @xmath31 the symbol @xmath32 denotes the @xmath33 matrix with @xmath34 forming the first and the second @xmath20 columns , respectively .",
    "the requirements   are essentially equivalent to certain explicit constraints imposed on the matrix pair @xmath35 . in this paper",
    "we will take advantage of the so - called @xmath36-form  @xcite .",
    "it consists in expressing the boundary conditions   in the block form @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the identity matrix of size @xmath20 , @xmath11 is a general complex @xmath40 matrix and @xmath41 is a hermitian @xmath42 matrix .",
    "if @xmath41 in   is a zero matrix , then the boundary conditions do not mix the values of functions and of their derivatives .",
    "boundary conditions of that type are usually called scale - invariant vertex conditions  @xcite .",
    "they define an interesting family of vertex couplings  @xcite with useful scattering properties  @xcite .",
    "one of the most natural singular interactions is the @xmath3-coupling ( also called `` @xmath3  potential '' ) , which is characterized by boundary conditions @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the parameter of the coupling .",
    "the @xmath3-coupling does not belong to the scale - invariant family , but is prominent due to its simple interpretation : it can be understood as a limit case of properly scaled smooth potentials  @xcite .",
    "if we set @xmath45 in  , we obtain boundary conditions of the _ free coupling _ ,",
    "@xmath46 which is the most trivial type of point interaction in a quantum graph .",
    "let @xmath47 be a finite connected metric graph .",
    "we denote the cardinality of @xmath6 by @xmath9 for the sake of brevity . from now on let @xmath48 denote the wave function on @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that the graph edges are finite , the potentials on the graph edges are bounded and that the self - adjoint boundary conditions in the vertices of @xmath0 are chosen in the following way :    * there is a vertex @xmath49 with free boundary conditions  . * in all the remaining vertices",

    "for example , any point inside a graph edge has this property , and , therefore , can be regarded as the vertex @xmath51 .",
    "now let us consider a graph @xmath52 which is constructed from @xmath0 by attaching two half lines to its vertex @xmath51 ( figure  [ fig : graph ] ) .",
    "we denote the half lines by @xmath53 ( `` input '' ) and @xmath54 ( `` output '' ) .",

    "positions of peaks in transmission characteristics are controllable by any mode that allows a variation of the spectrum of @xmath0 .",
    "the practically most convenient way is to expose @xmath0 to an external field . when the strength of the field is being adjusted , the spectrum of @xmath0 is varying , and the resonance peaks are changing their positions accordingly .",
    "an example of implementation has been discussed in section  [ section : loop ] , where @xmath0 being a loop in a magnetic field has been considered .",
    "scale - invariant vertex couplings proved useful already in a previous related work  @xcite . in this paper , we applied three different types of these couplings to design three different types of devices : a band - pass filter , a band - stop filter , and a spectral separator .",
