    "much interest has recently been raised by some new hints of possible signals of dark matter ( dm ) particles in experiments of direct detection ( cdms @xcite , cogent @xcite , cresst @xcite ) which previously reported upper bounds only .",
    "these hints are in fact only constituted by excesses of events over what would be expected from backgrounds .",
    "what is intriguing is that these events , if actually due to dm particles with a coherent interaction with the atomic nuclei of the detector material , would be concentrated in a physical region which , expressed in terms of the wimp mass and of the wimp - nucleon elastic cross  section , agrees with the physical region established with a high statistical significance by the dama collaboration from a measurement of annual modulation over 13 yearly cycles with the dama / nai and the dama / libra experiments @xcite .",
    "these results have prompted a large number of phenomenological papers focussed on wimps with a light mass ( around 10 gev ) and a wimp - nucleon elastic cross  section of order ( @xmath0 ) @xmath1 , whereas previous theoretical and experimental considerations were prevalently directed toward physical regions with much higher masses and lower cross  sections . turning to a specific candidate",
    ", it has now become common to consider neutralinos of light mass ( @xmath2 10 gev ) .    actually , already long ago in ref . @xcite it was stressed that , in case of r - parity conservation , a light neutralino ( _ i.e. _ a neutralino with @xmath3 50 gev ) , when it happens to be the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , constitutes an extremely interesting candidate for the dark matter in the universe , with direct detection rates accessible to experiments of present generation . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was also derived a lower bound of @xmath4 7 gev from the cosmological upper limit on the cold dark matter density .",
    "the theoretical framework , considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , which allows neutralinos with a mass in the range 7 gev @xmath5 50 gev is an effective minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) at the electroweak ( ew ) scale , where the usual hypothesis of gaugino - mass unification at the scale of grand unification ( gut ) of the sugra models , is removed ; this effective mssm is very manageable , since expressible in terms of a limited number of independent parameters .",
    "this model is the theoretical basis we also adopt for the phenomenological investigations presented in this work ( for simplicity , the model which entails low - mass ( @xmath3 50 gev ) neutralino configurations within this effective mssm will hereby be dubbed light neutralino model ( lnm ) ) ; its main features are briefly summarized in sect .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "when the dama collaboration published their experimental results collected with a nai detector of 100 kg over 7 annual cycles @xcite , in ref . @xcite it was proved that indeed the population of light neutralinos @xcite fitted well these data",
    "the possible interpretation of the annual modulation results in terms of light neutralinos was further confirmed in refs .",
    "@xcite , when the channeling effect was taken into account in the experimental analysis @xcite and the first dama / libra combined data were presented @xcite .",
    "we recall that the present collection of data by the same collaboration @xcite amounts to an exposure of 1.17 ton x year , with an evidence for an annual modulation effect at 8.9 @xmath6 c.l .. this extended collection of data entails that the dama / libra annual modulation regions in the plane wimp mass  wimp  nucleon scattering cross  section , reported in the figures of ref .",
    "@xcite with a comparison with the theoretical predictions within lnm , essentially maintain their shapes , but with a statistical significance increased from 6.5 @xmath6 to 7.5 @xmath6 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed definition of these regions ) .    as mentioned above , other experimental collaborations",
    "have recently reported some events that might be in excess of the expected backgrounds .",
    "two candidate events for dark matter , which would survive after application of various discrimination and subtraction procedures , were reported by the cdms collaboration @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that , should these events be actually due to dark matter , they would be compatible with light neutralinos and the dama results .",
    "likewise , compatible with the lnm and the previously quoted experimental data , would be the excess of bulk - like events reported by the cogent collaboration @xcite , again in case these might actually be significant of a dm effect .",
    "most recently , also the cresst collaboration has presented results which , if interpreted as due to dm particles , would point to wimps with a mass @xmath7 15 gev and a scalar wimp ",
    "nucleon cross section in the ballpark of the previous experiments @xcite .    as previously mentioned , the new experimental results of refs .",
    "@xcite , combined with the dama data , have recently triggered a large number of phenomenological considerations on coherently - interacting wimps of light mass ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite ) , with emphasis for the mass range 710 gev .",
    "we wish to stress that , though this is a very interesting mass interval , already pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , the physical region compatible with the dama results alone and accessible , in particular , to relic neutralinos is much wider ; its specific size depends on a number of astrophysical features ( e.g. wimp distribution function in the galactic halo ) and on the detector response ( role of the channeling effect in detectors which use crystals @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that for the case of a wimp halo distribution given by a cored  isothermal sphere the extended mass range is 7 gev @xmath5 60 gev . in view of the high significance of the annual modulation results versus the still preliminary character of the hints of experiments in refs .",
    "@xcite , we will consider in the present paper the status of relic neutralinos in the whole wimp light ",
    "mass range 7 gev @xmath5 50 gev , as we did in our previous publications on light neutralinos .    our present investigation is mainly focussed on the role that recent measurements at the tevatron and at the b  factories babar and belle can have in providing constraints on supersymmetric models more stringent than the ones previously considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . specifically , we consider the new data concerning the following processes : a ) the decay @xmath8 , the top  to  bottom quark decay with emission of a charged higgs ( @xmath9 ) , and the searches for neutral higgs bosons into a tau - lepton pair , at the tevatron ; b ) the rare decays @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 ) , at the b - factories babar and belle .",
    "these measurements have potentially a significant role in constraining the supersymmetric parameter space in the region of high @xmath14 and of light higgs masses and consequently in determining the allowed ranges for a number of crucial quantities : neutralino relic abundance , lower bound on the neutralino mass and elastic neutralino  nucleon cross  section . here",
    "the nature of these constraints is critically analyzed , taking also into account the fact that many of them are still affected by sizable uncertainties .",
    "their impact in constraining the parameter space of our supersymmetric model is investigated in a twofold way : by analytic investigations and by detailed numerical analyses .",
    "we believe that the analytic derivations are necessary : i ) to clarify how the relevant physical quantities mentioned above depend on the parameters of the lnm , ii ) to establish the impact that each specific constraint has on these model parameters and then consequently on the physical quantities , iii ) to direct the numerical analyses to the regions of the parameter space which are of most relevance , iv ) to interpret the outcomes of the numerical evaluations correctly and , finally , v ) to serve as a guide for an educated guess about how the present situation could evolve , as new experimental limits on supersymmetric parameters from accelerator experiments and other precision measurements might become available in the future .",

    "<S> here we examine in detail all these new data and show that the present published results from the tevatron and b - factories have only a mild effect on the original light neutralino population . </S>",
    "<S> this population , which fits quite well the dama / libra annual modulation data , would also agree with the preliminary results of cdms , cogent and cresst , should these data , which are at present only hints or excesses of events over the expected backgrounds , be interpreted as authentic signals of dm . for the neutralino mass </S>",
    "<S> we find a lower bound of 7 - 8 gev . </S>",
    "<S> our results differ from some recent conclusions by other authors because of a few crucial points which we try to single out and elucidate . </S>"
