    "absorbers are generally divided into quasar intrinsic absorption lines ( qials ) and spatially intervening absorption lines ( sials ) .",
    "qials are thought to be produced by gas clouds that are intrinsically associated with the nuclear regions of the quasars . on the other hand ,",
    "sials are produced by either intervening galaxies , which are located along the line of sight of the quasars , or the interstellar matter in the quasar host galaxies .",
    "it is essential to understand the origins of the absorption lines in order to answer the questions , such as what causes the extremely high number density of c  iv  lines in the spectrum of hs1603 + 3820 .    to distinguish qials from sials",
    ", we use the seven proper criteria which have been proposed in the literatures ( barlow & sargent 1997 ; hamann et al . 1997a ; and references therein ) :    \\(1 ) time variability of equivalent width",

    "( 1992 ) found that the broad absorption line ( bal ) with fwhm @xmath17 100 km  s@xmath4  near the emission redshift of cso203 is a qial , because the line shows time variability .",
    "hamann , barlow , & junkkarinen ( 1997b ) also found that the broad c  iv  doublet even at @xmath624000 km  s@xmath4  from q2343 + 125 show time variability .",
    "barlow & sargent ( 1997 ) and hamann et al . ( 1997a ) found qials by the covering factor analysis in pks0123 + 257 and um675 .",

    "they applied the method to the broad c  iv  line at the high ejection velocity end of the c  iv  complex , and found that it is a qial .",
    "however , the other lines were not classified , because they have line profiles narrower than the spectral resolution or maybe they are affected by other lines .",
    "in this paper , we present a high resolution ( r @xmath7 45000 ) spectrum of hs1603 + 3820 obtained with the high dispersion spectrograph ( hds ; noguchi et al .",
    "2002 ) on the subaru telescope .",

    "we carried out spectroscopic observation of the quasar hs1603 + 3820 ( @xmath1816h04m55@xmath194 , @xmath20 ) with hds on subaru telescope on 2002 march 23 ( ut ) .",
    "it has to be noted that the ly@xmath21  emission line is affected by complex metal absorption lines , which makes the value of emission - line redshift of the quasar uncertain ( d99 ) .",
    "d99 suggested the emission redshift as @xmath0  @xmath7 2.51 by estimating a continuum around the ly@xmath21  and c  iv  emission lines , and considering the fact that the redshifts determined from the broad emission lines can be blueshifted by @xmath17 1200 km  s@xmath4  with respect to the systemic redshift from the narrow forbidden lines ( espey 1993 ) .",
    "if we match the spectrum of the quasar taken by d99 to the sdss composite spectrum ( vanden berk et al .",
    "2001 ) using o  i  @xmath22 @xmath9 si  ii  @xmath23 and c  ii  @xmath24 emission lines , the systemic redshift of the quasar is estimated to be @xmath0  = 2.542 @xmath25 0.003 .",
    "richards et al .",
    "( 2002a ) also showed that quasars with weaker c  iv  emission lines tend to be large blueshifted in excess of 2000 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "since the c  ivemission line of hs1603 + 3820 is very weak , the systemic redshift of the quasar may be larger than @xmath0  = 2.51 .",

    "the data were reduced with the iraf package in the standard manner .",
    "we determined the continuum by fitting the data with a 3rd order cubic spline function .",

    "we acquired the normalized @xmath29-th order spectrum by dividing the quasar spectrum of order @xmath29 by @xmath30 .",
    "we used order 17 and 23 to produce @xmath40 , because orders 18 , 19 , 21 , 22 are weakly affected by absorption lines . in the middle window of figure 1 , the interpolated continuum of the order 20 , @xmath40 , is shown as a dotted line . for confirmation of the validity of this technique",

    "the continuum flux of order @xmath29 obtained with this interpolation method is only 3.3 % smaller on average than that of directly fitted spectrum .",
    "therefore , we believe this technique is sufficiently useful for our study .    the normalized spectrum of each order is combined to produce the final spectrum ( figure 2 ) .",

    "system a ( 2.42 @xmath50 2.45 ) : d99 detected 5 c  iv  lines in this system at the velocity shift of @xmath610600 km  s@xmath4  @xmath8 @xmath67800 km  s@xmath4  from @xmath0 in their spectrum .",
    "we found additional two c  ivlines in our spectrum as shown in figure 4 .",

    "five of the seven detected c  iv  lines ( @xmath2  = 2.4186 , 2.4257 , 2.4341 , 2.4362 , and 2.4510 ) are relatively broad and smooth , and their appearance are quite similar to each other . on the other hand , the line ( @xmath2  = 2.4366 ) has relatively narrow line profile .",
    "perhaps it is an independent system of the broad c  ivlines .",
    "another interesting result is that fe  ii  @xmath51 at @xmath52 detected in d99 have disappeared in our spectrum .",

    "system b ( @xmath2=2.48 ) : this is the strongest c  iv  line in the mmt spectrum ( d99 ) .",
    "our spectrum resolve this line into 18 narrow components with relatively small doppler parameters of 4 @xmath53 25 km  s@xmath4  ( figure 5 ) , and most of them can be explained by thermal broadening . relatively low - ionization lines such as si  ii  @xmath54 , al  ii  @xmath55 , and , fe  ii  @xmath51 associated with the c  iv  lines are also detected ( figure 5 ) .",
    "the strongest components of the low - ionization lines are observed at the center of this system , while the weak components exist almost symmetrically at both sides of the strongest one .",
    "system c ( @xmath2=2.54 ) : this is one of the two systems within 1000 km  s@xmath4  from the quasar .",
    "the line itself is narrow and not resolved into multiple components ( figure 6 ) .",
    "there are no other significant metal lines at this redshift .",
    "system d ( @xmath2=2.55 ) : another system within 1000 km  s@xmath4  from the quasar , though this system is redshifted from the quasar .",
    "this system is resolved into 4 narrow components ( figure 7 ) .",
    "the central two components reach almost zero intensity at their bottoms .",
    "the system also do not show up in any other metal lines .",
    "we detected as many as 30 c  iv , 7 al  ii , 8 si  ii , and one fe  ii  lines with velocity difference in the range of @xmath56 km  s@xmath4  @xmath57 km  s@xmath4  from the quasar .",
    "while all the metal lines discovered are , in terms of the velocity difference , relatively close to the quasar , they could be produced by either gas clouds that are intrinsically associated with the quasar or in intervening galaxies . with the hds spectrum , we examine the line profiles in detail to classify them into qial and sial . among the seven criteria to distinguish qials from sials described in",
    " 1 , we mainly use the criteria ( 1 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) which can be directly applied to our spectrum .",
    "absorbers which produce very broad and smooth profiles are expected to be intrinsically associated with the quasar nuclear region . for example , the broad absorption line systems ( bals ) with @xmath58 km  s@xmath4  are considered to be originated in gas motion in broad line region ( blr ) of quasars . on the other hand , intervening absorption lines that inherent to cosmologically intervening galaxies have narrow profile with @xmath59 km  s@xmath4 , which corresponds to gas temperature , t @xmath60 k for c  iv  ion .",
    "system a has five relatively broad c  iv  lines ( @xmath61 km  s@xmath4 ) , and all of them have relatively smooth line profiles and are not resolved into narrow components even in our high - resolution spectrum .",
    "their broad line profiles with @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) @xmath64 km  s@xmath4  are not likely to be produced by only thermal broadening , @xmath65 , because the corresponding temperature is very high , t @xmath66 k , compared with typical metal line systems . the micro turbulence , @xmath67 , is expected to contribute to the majority of the doppler parameter .",
    "therefore the results strongly suggest that these lines are intrinsic ones which occur in the vicinity of the quasar nucleus although doppler parameters of them are too small compared with those of bals .    on the other hand , system b , c , and d consist of only narrow components with @xmath68 km  s@xmath4  ( corresponding temperature is t @xmath69 k for c  iv  ion ) and 65@xmath70 of them have @xmath71 km  s@xmath4 , which imply that these systems can be produced by intervening galaxies .",
    "the component at @xmath2  = 2.4412 in system a also have relatively narrow line profile .",
    "we evaluate the covering factor , @xmath72 , which is the line - of - sight coverage fraction of the absorber over the continuum source .",
    "since the components of absorption systems seem to be fully resolved in our spectrum , we can evaluate the covering factors for c  iv  doublets , using the following equations : @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are residual fluxes at the line centers for blue ( c  iv  @xmath76 ) and red ( c  iv  @xmath77 ) components of the doublet lines on the normalized spectrum ( hamann et al .",
    "1997a ; barlow & sargent 1997 ) .",
    "we also evaluated optical depth at line center , @xmath78 , and the total column density , @xmath79 , for blue component derived by the following equations ( hamann et al .",
    "1997a ; barlow & sargent 1997 ; savage & sembach 1991 ; peterson 1997 ) : @xmath80 @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are oscillator strength and the resonance wavelength of the absorption line .",
    "for some c  iv  doublets , blue components reach to almost zero flux , and the residual flux is very uncertain . in that case , we assume that @xmath84 , and evaluate column densities by directly fitting the voigt profile for them .",
    "the @xmath72 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 of 30 c  iv  components are listed in table 1 . for c  iv  lines with @xmath46",
    ", we also evaluate @xmath79 in the case of @xmath45 for comparison .    for single lines such as al  ii , si  ii , and fe  ii",
    ", we evaluated only the lower limits for @xmath72 , and @xmath78 by the eqn .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , @xmath85 @xmath86 we also evaluated @xmath79 in the case of @xmath45 by the eqn ( 4 ) .",
    "al  ii  ( @xmath2  = 2.4785 ) and si  ii  ( @xmath2  = 2.4785 ) components in system b reach to almost zero flux at the line centers .",
    "we assume that @xmath45 for them , and evaluated column densities by directly fitting the voigt profile .    for system a , we evaluated these parameters for only two c  iv  lines ( @xmath2  = 2.4186 and 2.4412 ) , because other lines are heavily blended with each other , or with the si  ii  lines of system b. for the c  ivline at @xmath2=2.4186 , we also evaluated 1 @xmath44 errors of the parameters measured in the bottom of the line with 10 km  s@xmath4  velocity width , because this line has very broad line profile ( fwhm @xmath87 km  s@xmath4 ) , and the line center is uncertain .",
    "the c  iv  line ( @xmath2  = 2.4186 ) in system a is likely to be a qial , because the line has @xmath88 . on the other hand ,",
    "the c  iv  line at @xmath2  = 2.4412 has @xmath89 , although the value has uncertainty because of its blending with broad c  iv  lines at the same wavelength region .",
    "if those broad c  iv  lines are removed properly from the spectrum , the @xmath72 of the c  iv  line tends to increase toward 1 .",
    "the result of the covering factor analysis suggests that system b , c and d cover the quasar completely .",
    "the mean @xmath72 values of 18 , 1 , and 4 c  iv  components in system b , c and d are almost unity , 0.943 , 1.00 and 0.945 respectively , and 56% , 100% , and 50% of c  ivcomponents in these systems have @xmath72=1 .",
    "only the c  iv  line at @xmath2=2.4803 in system b has a exceptionally small covering factor , @xmath72=0.277 . but this value is tentative , because this line is heavily blended with the blue wing of the c  iv  line at @xmath2=2.4805 .      time variability can be a powerful tool in identifying qials , simply because once the variability is confirmed , the line is most likely to be a qial ( but qials are not always time variable ) . there were examples that show this method is indeed very valuable .",
    "absorption lines with time variability were found at @xmath2=2.13 on the spectrum of um675 ( hamann et al .",
    "1995 ) , and at @xmath2 = 2.24 on the spectrum of q2343 + 125 ( hamann et al . 1997b ) .",
    "equivalent widths of these lines varied by a factor of 3 and 4 within 12 and 0.3 years , respectively .",
    "the fe  ii  @xmath51 line at @xmath90 in the system a shows large time variability , though the identification of this line by d99 probably was not very secure .",
    "this line was disappeared in our spectrum , despite that it had been strong ( @xmath91  ) in d99 ( it is seen around 5525   in the lower window of figure 3 ) .",
    "the quantitative comparison of the equivalent width of the line in our spectrum with that of d99 is not given , because the spectral resolution was not identical .",
    "nonetheless , if the line identified by d99 would be confirmed to be a real fe  ii  line at @xmath90 , the presence of the time variability is evident and this line is probably associated with the quasar .",
    "here we classify the detected c  iv  lines into qials and sials based on the results in the previous section .",
    "after that , we consider the origin(s ) of the absorption lines and the cause of the large number density of c  iv  lines in the spectrum of high - redshift luminous quasar hs1603 + 3820 .        in system",
    "a , all of five broad c  iv  lines have similar smooth line profiles and they are detected within 3000 km  s@xmath4  from each other .",
    "one of them at @xmath2  = 2.4186 which corresponds to @xmath92 = @xmath56 km  s@xmath4  from hs1603 + 3820 is confirmed to have a small covering factor of @xmath93 0.31 .",
    "for this c  iv  line , fwhm , column density , and covering factor can be properly measured ; they are 190 km  s@xmath4 , 15.8 , and 0.31 , respectively , and in similar range of values with those of the already confirmed qials , 440 km  s@xmath4 , 15.2 and 0.19 for a c  iv  line at @xmath624000 km  s@xmath4  from q2343 + 125 ( hamann et al .",
    "1997b ) , and 56 km  s@xmath4 , 14.1 and 0.31 for a c  iv  line at @xmath61500 km  s@xmath4  from um675 ( hamann et al . 1997a ) .",
    "the other broad lines in system a can not be fitted individually because of line blending . nonetheless , they are very likely to be qials not only because they have lower ejection velocities ( nearer to the quasar ) than the c  iv  line at the lowest redshift ( @xmath2  = 2.4186 ) but also because they have similar line profiles to the fitted c  iv  line .",
    "on the other hand , there is at least one narrow c  iv  line with @xmath94 km  s@xmath4  ( @xmath2  = 2.4412 ) in the system , and the line is confirmed to have a large covering factor , @xmath72=0.8 , with the uncertainty by merging with other broad c  iv  lines . covering factor of the line is large , @xmath72 is close to unity , which also supports the idea that the line is a sial .",
    "if this is true , the association of the narrow line and the broad lines in system a is just a chance projection .",
    "there are at least two possible origins for absorbers that produce qials in system a. first , we consider the possibility that they are in fact similar absorbers that produce much broader lines in the spectra of the so - called broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars .",
    "bal absorbers , which produces lines with @xmath62 = 10,000  20,000 km  s@xmath4  are thought to be at the distance of a few tens of parsec from the continuum source of quasars ( cf .",
    "weymann , turnshek , & christiansen 1985 ; turnshek et al .",
    "although widths of the c  iv  lines in system a with @xmath62 = 60  120 km  s@xmath4  are much smaller than typical bals , they can be seen in the spectrum of the quasar at a phase in its transition from ( to ) a quasi - bal to ( from ) a standard quasar ( morris et al .",
    "1986 ; richards et al .",
    "when bal is formed , many narrow components could blend with each other and make broad absorption feature ( bal ) as time passes . or when bal dies , most of the optically thin gas of bal absorbers dissipate and only dense cores that produce narrow lines are left .",
    "ganguly , charlton , & bond ( 2001 ) also offered the sporadic ( or quasi - periodic ) mass ejection scenario that would have a density structure of the outflowing wind and produce narrow absorption line clustering .",
    "another candidate is outflowing clouds accelerated with the jets from the central engine of the quasar . in this case",
    ", the absorbing gas extends to distances of hundreds of kpcs ( bridle & perley 1984 ) . according to the small covering factor of the c  iv  line at @xmath2  = 2.4186 , however , this interpretation is not favorable because it is difficult for the absorbers at the distance of hundreds of kpcs from the quasar to cover the continuum source partially .",
    "based on these points , the broad c  iv  lines in system a are probably produced by outflowing absorbers that are very close to the continuum source .",
    "on the other hand , the narrow c  iv  line at @xmath2  = 2.4412 could be a sial which is arisen in an intervening absorber , or a qial which is produced by gas cloud outflowing with almost the same velocity as absorbers of the broad lines , though they are at high altitude because its covering factor is close to unity .",
    "another remarkable point is that fe  ii  line at @xmath2=2.4367 in d99 shows the time variability , which suggests the line is a qial .",
    "however , the relationship between this line and the corresponding c  iv  line at nearly same redshift is unclear .",
    "identification of the line as fe  ii  @xmath51 in d99 seems to be based on the detection of c  iv  lines at the same redshift . in our spectrum in which the line is not seen , however , we still have the corresponding c  iv  line at nearly the same redshift ( @xmath2  = 2.4366 ) .",
    "in fact , the line has relatively narrow line width , @xmath95 km  s@xmath4 , which can be interpreted as a sial .",
    "if this c  ivline is a really sial , we argue that the identification of the line at 5525   as fe  ii  @xmath51 in d99 may be reconsidered while there are other possibilities that ( i ) there was another c  iv  system at the same redshift that was disappeared with fe  ii or ( ii ) the c  iv  line is a qial but only fe  ii  line has been disappeared .",
    "all of the c  iv  components in system b have narrow line profiles , and they have large covering factors .",
    "system b is plausibly produced by clumpy gas clouds in an intervening galaxy .",

    "( system d ) from the quasar redshift imply that they could be physically associated to the quasar .",
    "there are at least two interpretations for these systems .",
    "first , the lines may be produced by the intervening galaxies in the vicinity of the quasar that moves around the quasar like cluster ( group ) of galaxies .",
    "the velocity differences of the systems from the quasar ( @xmath96 and @xmath97 km  s@xmath4 ) are within the typical velocity dispersion in rich clusters ( @xmath981000 km  s@xmath4 , for nearby richest cluster of galaxies ) . the large covering factors , @xmath99 , of these systems",
    "can be easily produced by such intervening galaxies .",
    "secondary , the lines could be produced by gas clouds intrinsically associated with the quasar , because system c and d do not have low - ionization lines such as si  ii , al  ii , and fe  ii , which suggests they are on high ionized level .",
    "the strong uv flux from the quasar can make them highly ionized . in the disk - wind model ( murray et al .",
    "1995 , 1998 ) that has been used to explain bal quasars , intrinsic gas clouds exist along the wind streamlines from the continuum source to relatively large distance .",
    "the simulations by proga , stone , & kallman ( 2000 ) show that once outflowing gas clouds reach a high altitude , they return toward the center along the outflowing stream , which can produce not only blueshifted but also redshifted absorption lines relative to the systemic redshift of the quasar simultaneously . therefore system c is outflowing from the quasar , while system d has already reached at a high altitude and flow into the central source of the quasar .",
    "these systems should be separate far enough from the quasar to cover the quasar entirely .",
    "if systems c and d are arisen in the galaxies around the quasar , namely they are sials , then five of eight c  iv  lines detected in d99 at 2.42 @xmath1 @xmath2@xmath1 2.55 are qials , and three is sials .",
    "the number density of sials per unit redshift is @xmath100 at @xmath2  @xmath7 2.38 . on the other hand , if systems c and d are classified into be qials , the corresponding number density is @xmath101 , which is almost consistent with the expected value , @xmath14 , at @xmath2  @xmath7 2.40 ( misawa et al .",
    ". therefore the number density excess of c  iv  absorption lines at @xmath2  @xmath7 @xmath0  in the spectrum of hs1603 + 3820 may be caused by the number density excess of qials .",
    "foltz et al .",
    "( 1986 ) found that the number density of c  iv  absorption line increases near the emission redshift of the radio - loud quasars with their @xmath7 1   resolution spectra .",
    "we evaluated the number densities of c  iv  absorption lines for the 5 quasars in foltz et al.s sample ( q1256 + 357 , q1416 + 067 , q1445 + 335 , q1634 + 176 , and q1756 + 237 ) that have strong absorption complexes near the quasars .",
    "we used the range of spectra between @xmath102 ( the redshift @xmath103 km  s@xmath4blueward from @xmath0 ) and @xmath0  or @xmath104 ( the redshift at which the c  iv  absorption line of highest-@xmath42 is detected beyond @xmath0 ) over which the 4@xmath44 detection limit corresponds to @xmath105 0.2  .",
    "the mean value of the c  iv  number density ( not a poisson sample ) is @xmath106 per redshift at @xmath2  @xmath7 1.65 . with the @xmath7 1.5   resolution spectrum of d99",
    ", the number density of c  iv  line for hs1603 + 3820 is evaluated to be 43.5 between @xmath102 and @xmath104 ( @xmath2  of system d ) over which the 4@xmath44 detection limit is @xmath105 0.15  .",
    "the @xmath13 for hs1603 + 3820 has a large value about the same as the mean value @xmath13 for 6 quasars in foltz et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , though the detection limit of equivalent width and spectrum resolution are slightly different .",
    "these number density excess of c  iv  lines at @xmath2  @xmath7 @xmath0  could be produced by qials .",
    "we have analyzed the c  iv  absorption line clustering at @xmath2  @xmath7 @xmath0  in the spectrum of hs1603 + 3820 using subaru@xmath9hds data . by using three properties of c  iv  lines , specifically , time variability , covering factor , and absorption line profile ,",
    "we have confirmed that among four c  iv  systems one system is almost certainly intrinsic to the quasar , one system is probably arisen in an intervening galaxy .",
    "the other two systems at @xmath2  @xmath7 @xmath0  have properties that are consistent with either interpretation .",
    "if they are classified into qials , the number density of sials in the poisson sample becomes to be almost consistent with the expected value at the similar redshift far from quasars . in figure 9 , we summarize the distributions of four c  iv  systems in the physical distance from the quasar in the cases that systems c and d are classified into sials and qials .",
    "we finally note some future prospects . in the course of this study , we have not applied the time variability analysis to system b , c , and d , because the resolution of our spectrum is different from that of d99 .",
    "an additional spectrum taken with the same configuration as our spectrum in a few months to years later might enable us to confirm the time variability of these systems .",
    "deep imaging observation with narrow - band filters for detecting ly@xmath21 or h@xmath21 emission lines of galaxies around the quasar will be also useful to understand the true origins of system c and d. if many galaxies are detected around the quasar at the redshift around @xmath0  of the quasar , they support the idea that system c and d are produced by intervening galaxies in the neighbor of the quasar",
