    "in the last two decades , the existence of a co - evolutionary trend between active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and their host galaxies has been established . massive galaxies exhibit a peak in star formation at @xmath5@xmath112 ( e.g. , cimatti et al .",
    "2006 ; madau and dickinson 2014 ) , the same redshift range ( @xmath5=2 - 3 ) where supermassive black hole ( smbh ) activity peaks , as seen in the quasar luminosity function ( hasinger et al . 2005 ; hasinger 2008 ; silverman et al . 2008 ; ueda et al . 2014 ; miyaji et al .",
    "however , before the peak in sf and agn activity ( i.e. , at @xmath43 ) the evolution of the smbh population is not necessarily closely linked to that of the stellar content of galaxies ( trakhtenbrot et al .",
    "2015 ) .    for a complete analysis of the way smbh and galaxies co - evolve before their density peak ,",
    "large samples of agn at both high redshifts and low luminosities are required .",
    "the rest frame comoving space density of quasars at z@xmath123 can put constraints on the bh formation scenario .",
    "the slope of the space density is linked to the time - scale of accretion of smbhs and can therefore become a tool to investigate the smbh formation and growth scenarios . eventually , this may distinguish between major - merger driven accretion and secular accretion .",
    "several optical surveys have already computed space densities and luminosity functions for high - z agn ( @xmath43 ; e.g. , richards et al .",
    "2006 ; willott et al . 2010 ; glikman et al .",
    "2011 ; ross et al .",
    "however , all these works tuned their relations only at high luminosities ( -27.5@xmath13 - 25.5 ) at @xmath43 , thus they all have large uncertainties in their faint end values .",
    "the limitation of optical surveys is that at low optical luminosities ( -24.5@xmath14 - 22 ) , the standard color - color quasar identification procedures become less reliable , because stars can be misinterpreted as quasars . as a result , low - luminosity agn luminosity functions from optical surveys are so far in disagreement ( e.g. , glikman et al .",
    "2011 ; ikeda et al . 2011 ; masters et al .",
    "moreover , optical surveys are biased against obscured sources , whose contribution becomes also more significant at low luminosities ( e.g. , ueda et al .",
    "2014 ) . to address both of these two issues ,",
    "high - z , low luminosity x - ray selected agn samples are required .",
    "phenomenological models of agn luminosity evolution have been developed over the years on the basis of hard x - ray ( 210 kev ) surveys , with a general consensus that the `` luminosity - dependent density evolution '' ( ldde ) model describes the existing data well ( ueda et al . 2003 ; hasinger et al .",
    "2005 ; gilli et al .",
    "2007 ; ueda et al . 2014 ; miyaji et al . 2015 ; buchner et al .",
    "the ldde model with exponential decline ( lddeexp hereafter ) shows that the peak of the agn space density is at @xmath152 - 3 for more luminous agn ( l@xmath1610@xmath17 erg s@xmath7 ) , followed by an exponential decline down to @xmath156 .",
    "the less luminous agn ( l@xmath1810@xmath17 erg s@xmath7 ) in ldde show a peak shifted towards more recent times , @xmath151 - 2 , followed by a decline to the highest redshifts reached so far ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "an alternative model , the flexible double power - law ( fdpl ) , has been proposed by aird et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , as an improvement with respect to the so - called `` luminosity and density evolution '' ( lade ) model ( aird et al .",
    "although based on different assumptions , the fdpl and the ldde models show a close agreement at all redshifts .    however , at @xmath43 both the ldde and the fdpl models are based on extrapolations of the low redshift predictions , given the poor statistics at these redshifts , and the space density evolution of low luminosity agn at @xmath43 is still affected by significant uncertainties .",
    "moreover , at @xmath43 the evolution is observed to be consistent with a pure density evolution ( pde ) model , with no further corrections ( vito et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "physically motivated quasar activation merger models have also been developed to constrain the accretion mechanism of bh growth and to disentangle between models of bh and galaxy co - evolution .",
    "mergers have been proposed as efficient triggering mechanisms for luminous , optically selected quasars ( e.g. , barnes & hernquist 1991 , shen et al .",
    "2009 , menci et al .",
    "2014 ) . both phenomenological and physical models",
    "remain poorly constrained at lower luminosities at @xmath43 .    in order to put better constraints on different models , and to improve our understanding of the bh growth and of agn triggering mechanisms in the early universe ,",
    "it is necessary to improve the statistics of the low luminosity agn population at @xmath43 . in the last decade ,",
    "several x - ray surveys ( in the 2 - 10 kev band ) have been sensitive enough to investigate this redshift range .",

    "the latter discrepancy can instead be caused by the low quality of some of the spectra in l - cosmos3 , which can provide a reliable redshift but a less safe estimate of the presence of a broad line .",
    "it is also worth noticing that the spectroscopic classification is based on the presence of at least one broad line on a wavelength range of about 5000  , while the sed classification is based on the minimum @xmath63 computed on a much larger bandwidth , from uv to nir .      for the remaining part of our analysis , and especially in the analysis of the space density for obscured and unobscured sources ( section [ sec : space_type ] ) , we divide our sample in type 1 , unobscured sources , and type 2 , obscured sources .    1 .",

    "however , these results need to be verified with a larger sample of spectroscopically verified sources , given that the best - fid sed template classification could be less reliable at these extreme redshifts , where sources are faint in both the optical / ir and the x - ray bands . moreover , at @xmath45.5 , i.e. , in the highest redshift bin in our high - luminosity space density , the caveat we described in the previous section ( i.e. , working only with photo-@xmath5 ) must be taken into account .",
    "we also compare our results with those from the optical surveys of masters et al ( 2012 , black diamonds , left ) and mcgreer et al .",

    "this result is consistent with our expectations , due to the fact that the optical surveys are limited to type 1 , unobscured sources .    at lower luminosities ( 10@xmath23@xmath43@xmath30@xmath1010@xmath113 , right in figure [ fig : space_w_type ] )",
    "there are larger uncertainties , but we find that the type 2 agn space density is @xmath823 times higher than the type 1 agn space density over the whole redshift range @xmath5=[3 - 4.5 ] .",

    "the result obtained by glikman et al .",
    "( 2011 ) at the same redshift , once again using optically selected type 1 agn , lies instead a factor of @xmath85 above our data .",
    "although our measures at @xmath94 are actually lower limits , since the _ chandra _ sample is not completed at this redshift and luminosity range , our results challenge those of glikman et al .",
    "merger - driven models of quasar triggering provide physical framework that fairly well predicts the redshift evolution of the space density of luminous agn ( @xmath11710@xmath118 erg s@xmath7 ) , with its peak at @xmath92 - 3 and the following decline ( e.g. , haiman & loeb 1998 ; volonteri et al .",
    "2003 ; hopkins et al . 2008 ) .    in this section",
    "we compare our results with those predicted by the basic quasar activation merger model by shen ( 2009 ) .",
    "the aim is to use the space density at high redshift to possibly constrain the accretion mechanisms of bh growth and to disentangle between models of bh and galaxy co - evolution .",
    "following civano et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and allevato et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , we compare the shen ( 2009 ) merger model with the newest available agn data at z@xmath33 , including the ones presented in this work .",
    "the shen ( 2009 ) model was built upon the dark matter halo major merger rate extracted from numerical simulations ( springel et al .",
    "2005 ; fakhouri & ma 2008 ) , which provides the number of triggering events per unit time , convolved with an assumed agn light curve , which characterizes the evolution of individual quasars . the light curve is described by an exponentially ascending phase , and a power - law descending phase .",
    "the end of the exponential growth is controlled by an agn feedback self - regulation condition between the peak luminosity and the host dark matter haloes of the type ( e.g. , wyithe & loeb 2003 ) @xmath119 , valid in the whole range of host halo masses above @xmath120 .",
    "the parameters of the model were tuned by shen ( 2009 ) to broadly reproduce the full bolometric , obscuration - corrected , agn luminosity function at 0.1@xmath10z@xmath106 , as well as the available large - scale clustering measurements of optical quasars available at the time .",
    "figure [ fig : lf_boss ] shows that the predictions of the reference merger model ( black solid line ) match well with the high - luminosity part of the optical quasar luminosity function ( lf ) in the redshift range @xmath5=[3.08 - 3.27 ] by boss ( ross et al .",
    "2013 ) . for this comparison",
    ", we corrected the model lf by a luminosity - dependent fraction from ueda et al .",
    "( 2014 ) to account only for type 1 unobscured sources with n@xmath12121 .",
    "the model predictions , however , tend to gradually overestimate the observed space density when moving to fainter luminosities ( @xmath12210@xmath123 erg s@xmath7 ) .",
    "this is even more evident when comparing the shen ( 2009 ) model with the number densities of fainter agn derived in this work ( figure [ fig : space_vs_model ] ) .",
    "the reference model ( black solid line ) is higher than the data by a factor of 3 to 10 , depending on the redshift .",
    "this behavior is not fully unexpected .",
    "the shen ( 2009 ) model was calibrated mostly on bright agn at z@xmath33 , while the faint agn data available at the time were poor ; it is also worth noticing that such an over - prediction was already observed by fiore et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , using the @xmath43 sample from the 4 ms cdf - s .    at fixed redshift ,",
    "the parameters defining the model seem to be well suited to reproduce the bright end of the agn luminosity , but tend to fail in matching the most up - to - date number counts from x - ray surveys .",
    "there are broadly two ways to improve the match between merger models and data : modify the agn light curve , or the host halo mass distribution , or a combination of both .    1 .   the black dotted lines in figures [ fig : lf_boss ] and [ fig : space_vs_model ] mark the predictions from a modified shen ( 2009 ) model in which we modified the agn light curve which characterizes the evolution of individual quasars , described by the combination of an exponential ascending phase and a power - law descending phase .",
    "we cut out the post - peak descending phase , with all other parameters held fixed . cutting out the post - peak descending phase",
    "can be physically interpreted as a natural consequence of a powerful quasar feedback , capable of massively clearing out gas from the host galaxy and thus stopping the fueling onto the central black hole ( e.g. , granato et al .",
    "2004 , lapi et al . 2006 ) .",
    "this change in the model represents an improvement with respect to the faint - end luminosity function , because a smaller number of low - luminosity agn is now predicted by the model , though it also tends to cause an under - prediction of the bright - end of the agn lf .",
    "a second variant to the shen ( 2009 ) model is characterized by a steepening in the @xmath124-@xmath125 relation below @xmath12610@xmath127 m@xmath128/h , with @xmath129 instead of @xmath119 , implying that preferentially lower - luminosity quasars are now related to more massive , less numerous host dark matter haloes . in this scenario ,",
    "less massive black holes within less massive host halos produce a less efficient feedback .",
    "this can be caused by gas accretion being less effective in weaker potential wells , which are less effective in retaining gas inside the halo and close to the smbh ( e.g. , kauffmann & haenaelt 2000 ) .",
    "a second potential cause is a direct correlation between the mass of the black hole and the efficiency of the feedback process ( e.g. , granato et al . 2004 ; fontanot et al .",
    "2015 ) . in both cases ,",
    "the final result is a break in the black hole ",
    "host galaxy scaling relations .",
    "the outcome of this third model is shown with dashed lines in figures [ fig : lf_boss ] and [ fig : space_vs_model ] . with this model the number densities of very luminous quasars",
    "are preserved , while those of lower luminosities ones gradually decrease , in better agreement with the data .",
    "evidence for a break in the black hole - galaxy scaling relations is also now claimed in the local universe ( scott & graham 2013 ) , and by independent theoretical models ( cirasuolo et al .",
    "2005 , fontanot et al .",
    "2006 , fontanot et al .",
    "biases in the local samples of dynamically - measured black holes may however seriously limit our true knowledge of the intrinsic scaling relations between black holes and their host galaxies ( e.g. , shankar et al .",

    "this does not imply that moderate or minor ( e.g. , with dwarf galaxies ) mergers may not have happened in these systems , given that disk regrowth in gas - rich systems may be a viable possibility at these masses ( e.g. , hopkins et al .",

    "nevertheless our data challenge a pure merger - driven scenario , in agreement with the results of cisternas et al .",

    "mergers may not be the unique driver for the evolution of agn , especially at lower luminosities .",
    "other `` in - situ '' processes such as disk instabilities and/or clumpy accretion may be effective in channelling flows of gas down towards the very center of the host galaxy , eventually fuelling the black hole ( e.g. , bower et al . 2006 ; bournaud et al . 2011",
    "; di matteo et al .",
