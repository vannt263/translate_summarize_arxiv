    "because co is the second most abundant molecule in interstellar space , it plays a central role in our understanding of this environment .",
    "our focus is on diffuse molecular clouds , where the co abundance is derived from absorption seen against the ultraviolet ( uv ) continuum of a background star .",
    "comparisons between observational results and theoretical photochemical models provide the means to extract the physical conditions for the absorbing material .",
    "in particular , gas densities , kinetic temperatures , and the flux of uv radiation penetrating into the cloud can be inferred . in this paper , we present a refined analysis of co spectra obtained with the @xmath0 satellite , emphasizing sight lines with modest co column densities ( @xmath3 10@xmath4 @xmath5 ) .",
    "the data are especially useful for interpreting the co abundance in regions where ch@xmath2 chemistry leads to the production of other molecules ( e.g. , draine & katz 1986 ; zsarg & federman 2003 ) and before the effects of co self shielding become important ( see van dishoeck & black 1988 ) .",
    "recent developments prompted us to revisit these data , which were discussed previously by jenkins et al .",
    "( 1973 ) , morton & hu ( 1975 ) , federman et al .",
    "( 1980 ) , snow & jenkins ( 1980 ) , allen , snow , & jenkins ( 1990 ) , and federman et al .",
    "foremost , a self - consistent set of oscillator strengths ( @xmath6-values ) for the @xmath7 bands seen at wavelengths greater than 1200   and rydberg transitions involving the @xmath8 ( 0 - 0 ) , @xmath9 ( 0 - 0 ) , and @xmath10 ( 0 - 0 ) bands below 1200    is emerging ( e.g. , chan , cooper , & brion 1993 ; eidelsberg et al .",
    "1999 ; federman et al .",
    "in other words , the same co column density ( or abundance ) is derived regardless of the band(s ) under study . in the present work",
    ", the rydberg transitions are studied .",
    "second , more sophisticated packages , such as noao s iraf and profile fitting routines , provide us with the ability to reduce and analyze the data in a more precise way .    through these two developments ,",
    "a more robust set of observational results arises .",
    "the next section describes the methods employed in treating the archival data .",
    "this is followed by a general discussion of the observational results and by an analysis of relationships among line of sight column densities for comparison with our earlier conclusions ( federman et al .",
    "1980 ; federman et al . 1994 ) .",
    "while it is not our aim to present a detailed chemical picture here , we note that zsarg & federman ( 2003 ) incorporated the present results in chemical analyses of molecule formation during ch@xmath2 synthesis .",
    "we extracted high - resolution spectra taken with the u1 photomultiplier tube from the @xmath0 archive at the multiwavelength archive at the space telescope science institute .",
    "the nominal spectral resolution was 0.05  .",
    "the spectra covered absorption from the @xmath8 ( 0 - 0 ) band at 1150  , the @xmath9 ( 0 - 0 ) band at 1088  , and the @xmath10 ( 0 - 0 ) band at 1076  .",
    "individual scans were examined ; those completely encompassing the co band and free from peculiarities were rebinned and summed to yield a final spectrum .",
    "the stellar continua were fitted with a low - order polynomial within the iraf environment to produce rectified spectra for further analysis .",
    "examples of rectified spectra are shown in figures 1 to 3 .",
    "there are two points to note about these spectra .",
    "first , the available spectral range was limited by the coverage of the spectral scan .",
    "this is evident in the @xmath11 and spectrum near the @xmath10 band ( see fig .",
    "second , a chlorine line at 1088   is the feature at longer wavelengths in fig .",
    "equivalent widths ( @xmath12 ) were measured off these spectra for comparison with earlier work and with our results of fitting the co band profiles .",
    "the values of @xmath12 appear in table 1 ; upper limits represent 3-@xmath13 values .",
    "the quoted uncertainties were determined from the root - mean - square ( rms ) deviations in the stellar continuum and the width of the feature at the 50% level . for upper limits ,",
    "the width was taken to be 0.05   or the apparent value for a 2-@xmath13 ` feature ' , whichever was larger .",
    "there are three potential sources of background in coadded @xmath0 spectra , energetic particle counts , stray light , and scattered light .",
    "all archived spectra were corrected for particle background .",
    "procedures to eliminate stray light were introduced in data acquired after 19 april , 1973 . for measurements before this date ,",
    "we estimated the contribution from stray light by examining scans of saturated h@xmath1 and n  ii lines at nearby wavelengths . in the worst cases ( hd  21278 , 67 oph , and @xmath11 and ) , about 30% of the continuum level could be from stray light . since accidental blockage of the stray light source",
    "could have taken place in the co scans , we did not apply any corrections , but instead note the three sight lines by different symbols in the plots described below .",
    "neither did we correct for scattered light , which could represent 5 to 10% of the local continuum .",
    "as note above , many of these spectra were analyzed by others . for most bands , the earlier measurements of @xmath12 ( morton & hu 1975 ; federman et al .",
    "1980 ) and ours show relatively good agreement , consistent at the 2-@xmath13 level .",
    "essentially all are consistent at the quoted 3-@xmath13 level .",
    "the results for @xmath13 sco may agree as well , but we note that allen et al .",
    "( 1990 ) did not provide an estimate for the uncertainty in their measurement .",
    "the main difference is that our results generally have smaller uncertainties because ( 1 ) all available data were used to produce final spectra and ( 2 ) the rms deviations in the stellar continua were more easy to quantify upon adoption of low - order polynomials for their shapes .",
    "our values for @xmath12 tend to be smaller than earlier measures ; this may also be due to our ability for improved fits to stellar continua .",
    "since snow & jenkins ( 1980 ) only presented column densities obtained from fitting the co band profiles , we compare their results with ours after describing our method for profile synthesis .",
    "each band was synthesized separately with the least - squares fitting routine ( see lambert et al .",
    "1994 ) used in our laboratory study of rydberg transitions ( federman et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the wavelengths for individual rotational lines were taken from the compilation of eidelsberg et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , and we used the @xmath6-values of federman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for the @xmath8 ( 0 - 0 ) , @xmath9 ( 0 - 0 ) , and @xmath10 ( 0 - 0 ) bands seen in our spectra .",
    "moreover , a @xmath14-value of 1 km s@xmath15 , based on ultra - high - resolution studies ( @xmath16/@xmath17 @xmath18 500,000 to 900,000 ) of ch absorption in diffuse clouds ( crane , lambert , & sheffer 1995 ; crawford 1995 ) , and an instrumental width of 0.05   were adopted .",
    "[ a similar value of 1.2 km s@xmath15 was adopted by snow & jenkins ( 1980 ) in their study of sight lines in scorpius . ] for each spectrum , the wavelength offset for the r(0 ) line and column density were varied until the difference between measured and synthesized spectra was minimized .",
    "( the spectra shown in fig .",
    "1 - 3 have the r(0 ) line appearing at its laboratory wavelength . )",
    "as indicated by the values of @xmath12 in table 1 , the absorption is quite weak in most instances . only in the cases of stronger absorption",
    "can one discern partially resolved rotational structure . for spectra revealing stronger absorption ( e.g. , see fig .",
    "2 ) , we were able to infer the rotational excitation temperature ( @xmath19 ) as well .",
    "this was done in an iterative manner ; for sight lines revealing absorption from more than one band , comparison of fitting results among bands was performed .",
    "otherwise , @xmath19 was set at 4.0 k. for many of the directions , more than one neutral gas component is seen in c  i spectra taken with the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( zsarg & federman 2003 ) . since these directions tend to have rather weak co absorption , the inferred co column densities are not especially sensitive to optical depth effects , regardless of the number of components or the adopted @xmath14-value .",
    "for example , a column density of @xmath20 @xmath5 , larger than found for most of the present sample , yields an optical depth at line center of @xmath3 3 for r(0 ) in the strong @xmath9 band .",
    "the results of our fits appear in table 2 .",
    "the co column density toward @xmath21 per differs by a small amount ( @xmath22 2% ) compared to that analyzed by zsarg & federman ( 2003 ) and so their conclusions are not altered .",
    "the listed uncertainties for individual determinations of column density are based on the uncertainties in @xmath12 . in cases where fits to more than one band were possible , the final column density was derived by taking a weighted mean of the individual determinations .",
    "fits to spectra showing no clear absorption in one band yielded consistent column densities .",
    "however , the column density toward @xmath16 ori from the @xmath12 for the @xmath8 band clearly is much larger than with those from the other bands and is not listed in table 2 . in a similar vein ,",
    "the relatively large upper limits determined for the @xmath8 band toward 1 sco , @xmath23 sco , @xmath24 nor , and @xmath25 ara are not especially useful .",
    "finally , for sight lines with only upper limits , the most stringent column density was used in our analyses below .",
    "we now compare the results of the fits with our direct measurements for @xmath12 and with the column densities given by snow & jenkins ( 1980 ) and federman et al .",
    "for the most part , the values of @xmath12 derived from profile synthesis agree very well with our new measurements .",
    "the largest differences in @xmath12 , usually at the 2-@xmath13 level , occur for the @xmath9 band , such as that seen in fig",
    ". 2 for 20 tau .",
    "the band is partially blended with absorption from cl  i at 1088  , making these spectra the most susceptible to a poorly defined continuum .",
    "the comparison with the column densities of snow & jenkins is less satisfactory .",
    "their column densities are several times larger than ours .",
    "the difference does not lie in the adopted @xmath14-value or @xmath19 ; they are very similar . moreover , the @xmath6-values used in the fits , those quoted by snow ( 1975 ) versus those of federman et al . ( 2001 ) , are not that different .",
    "other possible causes can not be discerned because snow & jenkins did not tabulate @xmath12 .",
    "federman et al . ( 1994 ) used published values for @xmath12 and updated @xmath6-values for the @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands in their compilation .",
    "differences between their adopted values of @xmath12 and our fitted ones , when combined with the factor of 1.6 for the ratio of adopted @xmath6-values [ those of federman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) being larger ] , successfully explains the differences seen in the present column densities and the ones quoted in the compilation . in passing we note that federman et al .",
    "( 1994 ) also found self - consistent results from the two co bands because the new and older @xmath6-values differ by a scale factor ( 1.6 ) .",
    "in the course of our study on nonthermal chemistry in gas with low molecular abundances ( zsarg & federman 2003 ) , we found archival spectra for hd  112244 covering the @xmath7 ( 4 - 0 ) and ( 5 - 0 ) bands .",
    "the data were acquired with grating g160 m of the ghrs .",
    "the spectra ( z0yv0607 m , z0yv0608 m , and z0yv0609 m ) were reduced in the manner described by zsarg & federman .",
    "in addition , we smoothed the final , rectified spectra by three pixels to increase the signal to noise .",
    "the bands were synthesized with the @xmath6-values of chan et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , a @xmath14-value of 1 km s@xmath15 , and @xmath19 of 4.0 k. the values for @xmath12 and the column densities appear in table 3 .",
    "two components are discerned , though the weaker , bluer one is formally a 2.5-@xmath13 detection .",
    "its reality is strengthened by the fact that the velocity separation of @xmath26 25 km s@xmath15 agrees nicely with those seen in ch ( danks , federman , & lambert 1984 ) and c  i ( zsarg & federman 2003 ) , 24.6 and 24.1 km s@xmath15 , respectively . as found here for co , the red ch component is the stronger one , while the two components have similar strengths in c  i.",
    "the results described in the last section represent the lowest co column densities measured in interstellar space .",
    "most determinations are in the range of @xmath27 to @xmath28 @xmath5",
    ". studies of co emission at millimeter wavelengths generally are sensitive to column densities greater than @xmath29 @xmath5 , values seen in molecule - rich diffuse gas like that toward @xmath30 oph ( e.g. , lambert et al . 1994 ) . even when measuring absorption at millimeter wavelengths against background extragalactic sources ( e.g. , liszt & lucas 1998 ) , column densities are found to be greater than @xmath31 @xmath5 . clearly , uv absorption is the most sensitive probe of co in diffuse clouds .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with another result arising from our profile syntheses .",
    "we find that the co excitation temperature is barely above the 2.7 k value of the cosmic background . for comparison",
    ", @xmath19 is about 4 to 6 k in molecule - rich diffuse gas ( e.g. , lambert et al .",
    "1994 ; federman et al .",
    "the gas probed by our observations reveal severe subthermal co excitation , another indication that we are sampling a relatively low density environment .",
    "analysis of c  i excitation ( zsarg & federman 2003 ) for many of the same directions leads to density estimates of 10 to 200 @xmath32 , with the larger estimates associated with sight lines ( in scorpius ) having @xmath19 of 4 k. for most of our other sight lines , jenkins , jura , & loewenstein ( 1983 ) extracted pressures from c  i absorption seen in @xmath0 spectra . when combined with the kinetic temperatures deduced from the @xmath33 @xmath18 0 and 1 levels of h@xmath1 ( savage et al .",
    "1977 ) , low densities are again inferred .",
    "the correspondences between @xmath34(co ) with @xmath34(h@xmath1 ) , @xmath34(ch ) , and @xmath34(ch@xmath2 ) for our set of directions appear in figures 4 - 6 .",
    "the plots distinguish between components a and b toward hd  112244 .",
    "the upper limit for @xmath34(ch@xmath2 ) in component b is obtained by multiplying the uncertainty given by lambert & danks ( 1986 ) for component a by 3 .",
    "the h@xmath1 column densities come from savage et al .",
    "the two components toward hd  112244 were given half the total h@xmath1 , consistent with the similar amounts of c  i in each ( zsarg & federman 2003 ) .",
    "the results for ch come from the compilation of federman et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , updated to include the column densities found by crane et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and those for ch@xmath2 are from federman ( 1982 ) , lambert & danks ( 1986 ) , crane et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and price et al .",
    "the column densities used in this analysis appear in table 4 .",
    "typical uncertainities are 30% for @xmath34(h@xmath1 ) and 10 to 30% for the column densities of carbon - bearing molecules .",
    "we adopted 3-@xmath13 upper limits for non - detections .",
    "the relationship involving co and h@xmath1 appears to show a reasonable correlation .",
    "if we assume the upper limits are detections , the correlation coefficient ( @xmath35 ) is 0.53 .",
    "since our set of data includes upper limits on co , we also performed a linear regression with censored data , relying on the package asurv - rev .",
    "1.1 ( see isobe , feigelson , & nelson 1986 ; isobe & feigelson 1990 ; la valley , isobe , & feigelson 1992 ) .",
    "the buckley - jones method was employed because limits existed only for the dependent variable , log  @xmath34(co ) .",
    "the fit is shown in fig .",
    "4 as the solid line ; the slope is @xmath36 and the intercept is @xmath3718.35 .",
    "the fitted results are nearly identical to those from a simple linear least - squares fit ( @xmath38 and @xmath3716.0 ) because few data are represented by limits .",
    "the slope is similar to the one found previously by federman et al .",
    "( 1980 ) , whose survey included both molecule - rich and molecule - poor lines of sight .",
    "the value of the slope arises from the competition between co production under equilibrium conditions in colder , denser gas ( @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath32 ) and production as a result of ch@xmath2 synthesis in lower density gas ( @xmath39 @xmath41 @xmath32 ) . under equilibrium conditions in diffuse molecular clouds , co is a second generation molecule , forming in appreciable quantities once significant amounts of oh are present ( e.g. , federman & huntress 1989 ) .",
    "in particular , the synthesis of co mainly arises from reactions between c@xmath2 and oh . if this were the only pathway leading to co , a slope of 2 would be expected ( federman et al . 1984 ) .",
    "on the other hand , when ch@xmath2 is synthesized in lower density material in the cloud via nonequilibrium processes , observable amounts of co are produced in subsequent reactions involving ch@xmath2 and o ( e.g. , zsarg & federman 2003 ) . then @xmath34(co )",
    "is not dependent on @xmath34(h@xmath1 ) .",
    "the combination of the two schemes leads to a slope smaller than 2 . some of the dispersion seen in fig .",
    "4 probably results from differences in the relative contributions from the two pathways for co. for directions in common with the present study , zsarg & federman typically find 10 to 30% of the co comes from ch@xmath2 , except for the sight lines in scorpius where most of the co is attributed to the presence of ch@xmath2 because the densities are several times higher .",
    "moreover , the modest relationship between co and h@xmath1 likely arises because most of the h@xmath1 along the line of sight is associated with the denser material , not the gas containing ch@xmath2 .    since there is a strong correlation between log  @xmath34(ch ) and log  @xmath34(h@xmath1 ) in diffuse molecular gas ( federman 1982 ; danks et al .",
    "1984 ) , it is surprising at first glance to see such a poor correspondence between @xmath34(co ) and @xmath34(ch ) ( fig .",
    "5 ) , where @xmath35 @xmath18 0.21 . the correlation coefficient of 0.54 for log  @xmath34(ch ) versus log  @xmath34(h@xmath1 ) for our dataset indicates a tighter correspondence , but even this is significantly less than @xmath35 @xmath18 0.80 found by danks et al . while a linear regression by the schmitt method in asurv ( which treats limits in the independent variable ) suggests that 4 of 5 upper limits are consistent with detections ,",
    "the slope and intercept are not well defined .",
    "the relationship also contrasts with the one revealed in fig .",
    "9 of federman et al .",
    "the key to understanding the present result lies in the source for ch in our sample .",
    "the sight lines in the current survey are not particularly rich in molecules in large part because the gas densities are rather low ( e.g. , zsarg & federman 2003 ) .",
    "confirmation of low densities comes from observations of c@xmath1 and cn , tracers of denser gas ( joseph et al . 1986 ; federman et al . 1994 ) , which yield only upper limits for the sight lines examined here .",
    "zsargo & federman found that most of the observed ch could be attributed to production of ch@xmath2 under nonequilibrium conditions .",
    "( like co , ch is produced under both equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions . ) since reactions between ch and o play a minor role compared to those between ch@xmath2 and o ( zsarg & federman 2003 ) , little correspondence between co and ch is expected for our sight lines .",
    "on the other hand , the sample in federman et al .",
    "( 1994 ) primarily contains molecule - rich clouds where ch chemistry is intimately tied to the amount of h@xmath1 ( federman 1982 ; danks et al .",
    "1984 ) .    the data in fig .",
    "6 suggest a correlation between co and ch@xmath2 as well ( @xmath35 @xmath18 0.61 assuming all data are detections ) .",
    "the slope is @xmath42 , yet a linear relationship is expected when co arises from ch@xmath2 @xmath43 o ( federman et al . 1984 ) .",
    "the schmitt method indicates that only 2 of 8 upper limits are possible detections and yields a slope that is not well determined .",
    "therefore , it seems that the apparent correlation is strongly influenced by the results for @xmath44 sco in the lower left corner of the plot .",
    "most of the co appears to exist in regions denser than those responsible for the ch@xmath2 ( and ch ) toward many stars in our sample .    in summary",
    ", we presented the most complete , internally consistent set of co column densities for sight lines containing modest amounts of molecular material .",
    "these column densities are relatively small ; co self - shielding does not affect the photodissociation rate needed to model these sight lines .",
    "thus our results can be used to test chemical aspects of the models that do not rely on radiative transfer in lines .",
    "the correspondence between co and h@xmath1 found in earlier studies is still present , but there is no apparent connection with ch for these directions .",
    "this latter result indicates that much of the co is probing the denser portions of our sample of diffuse clouds , those clouds where ch is mainly produced as a by - product of ch@xmath2 synthesis .",
    "the ambiguous relationship between co and ch@xmath2 also seems to reflect different chemical environments .",
    "we thank matt fritts for his help on codes used for profile synthesis , david knauth for his assistance with idl routines , and david lambert and the referee , don york , for comments on earlier versions of the paper .",
    "we acknowledge the useful exchanges with don york , ed jenkins , and jim lauroesch regarding background levels in @xmath0 spectra .",
