    "while the concept of energy plays a fundamental role in the classical dynamics of finite systems , it has not been clear how to extend this concept into the setting of general relativity .",
    "traditionally , the relativist has had to choose between a ` global ' energy  the arnowitt ",
    "deser  misner ( adm ) mass defined at spacelike infinity  and a ` local ' energy  the energy density defined over an infinitesimal neighbourhood . the search for a ` quasilocal ' definition of energy which bridges the gulf between these extremes has uncovered a number of different candidates .",
    "however , the issue of whether one of these has preferred status over the others has yet to be settled .",
    "recently , brown and york  @xcite have proposed that the quasilocal energy for a system ( as measured by a given set of observers ) be defined as the classical value of its hamiltonian .",
    "this definition , generalizes the definition of energy which appears in mechanics and has a number of attractive features .",
    "many of these have been outlined by brown and york .",
    "here our purpose is not to review all the various features of this definition of quasilocal energy , nor to judge its merits by comparison to other definitions .",
    "quite apart from any interpretation as a quasilocal energy , the hamiltonian plays a fundamental role in general relativity .",
    "it is natural to wonder what consequences the local energy conditions hold for the classical value of the hamiltonian .",
    "placing labels aside , this is the question we address .",
    "we demonstrate that when the local dominant energy condition holds everywhere on a spacelike hypersurface , a ` quasilocal dominant energy condition ' can be derived . defining a ` ground state ' as a state which extremizes the hamiltonian over the class of vacuum states which all have a given boundary geometry",
    ", the quasilocal dominant energy condition implies that perturbations from a ground state which leave boundary conditions invariant can not give rise to spacelike variations of the quasilocal momentum field .",
    "a consequence of this is that such perturbations can not decrease the quasilocal energy below its ground state value .    while the details of this quasilocal energy condition will be specified below , it is important to stress at the outset that it does not imply positivity of the quasilocal energy .",
    "in fact , it is easy to show that the quasilocal energy is not positive definite .",
    "explicit examples of negative energy states can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to see why the quasilocal energy can not be positive definite ,",
    "consider a system of metric and matter fields with support on a compact spacelike hypersurface without boundary .",
    "the extremal hamiltonian on such a hypersurface vanishes by virtue of the constraint equations .",
    "now let a closed 2surface bifurcate the spacelike hypersurface into ` inside ' and ` outside ' regions .",
    "the hamiltonians for the ` inside ' and ` outside ' regions will in general be non  vanishing ( by virtue of boundary contributions to the hamiltonian ) .",
    "furthermore , since the hamiltonian is additive , the values for the ` inside ' and ` outside ' regions must be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian can not be positive definite .",
    "one might imagine that there is some way to define the ground state such that the _ difference _ between the quasilocal energy of a given state and the quasilocal energy of the ground state is positive definite .",
    "however , by an argument similar to that provided above , one can show that there is no definition of the ground state which would result in quasilocal energies which are both additive and positive definite relative to the ground .",
    "these results are not so disastrous as they seem .",
    "it has been shown that for asymptotically flat spacetimes , the quasilocal energy ( as evaluated at spacelike infinity and relative to the minkowski vacuum ) reduces to the arnowitt ",
    "deser  misner ( adm ) energy  @xcite .",
    "also , in the local limit , the quasilocal energy ( relative to the minkowski vacuum ) reduces to the three volume integral of the energy density  @xcite .",
    "hence , there is no obvious conflict with the positivity of the classical energy .    before exploring matters further ,",
    "let us review the hamiltonian formulation of general relativity for systems with timelike boundary and the definition of quasilocal energy to which it gives rise .",
    "let @xmath0 be a spacetime with topology @xmath1 , where the @xmath2 are closed , orientable spacelike hypersurfaces and @xmath3 is a closed ( timelike ) interval .",

    "the action functional appropriate to fixed intrinsic geometry on @xmath4 is  @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the extrinsic curvature tensor on @xmath13 while @xmath23 is the extrinsic curvature tensor on @xmath15 and @xmath24 is the local boost parameter on @xmath17 .",

    "the question of whether there exists a particularly useful choice for @xmath28 in the gravitational context has received some attention  @xcite . however , here we are interested only in variations of the action between states satisfying the same boundary conditions .",
    "these variations are , of course , independent of @xmath28 .",

    "this formulation employs a natural extension of classical hamilton  jacobi theory and is valuable to review because we shall find that the quasilocal dominant energy condition can be expressed in terms of variations of the boundary stress tensor .",

    "let @xmath59 be the lapse of proper time as measured from @xmath17 to a neighboring slice @xmath60 by observers traveling orthogonal to @xmath17 .",

    "in this section , we establish that the local dominant energy condition gives rise to a quasilocal counterpart .",
    "let us begin by deriving an expression for the variation of the quasilocal momentum field induced when we perturb a vacuum state to obtain a new state satisfying the same boundary conditions .    consider a manifold @xmath5 of the type discussed in the previous section .",
    "constrain the geometry on its timelike boundary @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath72 be the class of all smooth metrics which cover @xmath5 and have the appropriate geometry on @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath73 be the sub  class of these metrics composed of all solutions which are vacuum states of the matter field ( i.e. solutions to einstein s equations with @xmath74 ) .",
    "depending on the choice of the fixed geometry on @xmath15 , @xmath73 may be a finite set , an infinite set , or the empty set .",

    "it can also be derived by taking variations of the microcanonical action  @xcite around @xmath75 and taking the limit @xmath78 .",
    "now let us further refine the scope of our attention to variations of the hamiltonian around an _ extremum of its vacuum values_. define @xmath79 to be the set of solutions which extremize @xmath80 over @xmath73",
    ". we will refer to any such states as ` ground states ' compatible with the fixed geometry on @xmath15 . from ( [ varham ] )",

    "( [ interm2 ] ) implies , @xmath86    we interpret equation ( [ qlec3 ] ) as a quasilocal dominant energy condition .",
    "it requires that perturbations from a ground state , @xmath87 , which preserve the fixed geometry of @xmath15 can not give rise to a spacelike variation of the quasilocal momentum vector @xmath88 .",
    "let us examine more closely the significance of the quasilocal energy condition ( [ qlec3 ] ) .    first , it is important to stress that equation ( [ qlec3 ] ) in general only holds for variations conducted around a ground state ( i.e. a vacuum state which extremizes the hamiltonian over @xmath73 ) .",
    "in fact , it is easy to see that equation ( [ qlec3 ] ) can be violated when variations are conducted around a vacuum solution which is not extremal .",
    "perturbations from one vacuum solution to another would generate linear variations in the hamiltonian and , hence , must in some cases result in a decrease of the quasilocal energy .",
    "[ an explicit example which demonstrates this is given in the next section . ]",
    "second , note that for a given fixed geometry along @xmath15 , there is no guarantee that a ground state will exist .",
    "nor is there any guarantee that when a ground state exists it is unique . in principle , there might even even be an infinite set of ground states compatible with a given boundary geometry .",
    "third , note that equation ( [ qlec3 ] ) holds only for _ local _ perturbations around a ground state .",
    "it does not necessarily imply that a ground state is a global minimum energy state , nor does it necessarily imply the existence of a finite least energy state ( see example of next section ) . in some cases ,",
    "a given fixed geometry on @xmath15 might give rise to an infinite class of vacuum solutions for which the energy could be arbitrarily negative .",
    "fourth , note that the quasilocal dominant energy condition yields a quasilocal weak energy condition as a consequence .",
    "specifically , if we choose a time flow vector parallel to @xmath16 , equation ( [ qlec3 ] ) yields @xmath89 where @xmath50 is the quasilocal energy for the system with matter distribution and @xmath90 is the quasilocal energy for the ground state .",
    "an explicit example will help clarify the discussion of the previous section .",
    "let @xmath91 be a spacetime with schwarzschild geometry , @xmath92 further suppose the spacetime extends between timelike tubes at @xmath93 and @xmath94 .    to evaluate the quasilocal energy as measured by observers on a given boundary 2surface , we must choose a time flow vector such that the lapse and shift are constant over the boundary 2surface . [",
    "note that the lapse is not constant over @xmath95 for @xmath96 .",
    "] let us take @xmath97 where @xmath98 and evaluate the quasilocal energy over the boundary 2-surface at @xmath99 .",
    "in this frame , the line element ( [ schwarz ] ) becomes @xmath100 \\,dr^2+r^2\\,d\\omega^2.\\label{newschwarz}\\ ] ]    let us fix the geometry on @xmath15 so that its intrinsic line element is @xmath101 for @xmath93 and @xmath94 . from ( [ newschwarz ] )",
    "it is clear that the schwarzschild solutions with @xmath102 provide isometric embeddings of the boundary geometry .",
    "hence , @xmath73 consists of all schwarzschild solutions with @xmath103 .    evaluating expression ( [ varham ] ) for variations in the hamiltonian over this class of vacuum solutions yields ,",
    "@xmath104    equation ( [ exam ] ) implies that flat spacetime is the unique ground state compatible with these boundary conditions ( i.e. @xmath79 consists of a unique element which is the flat metric ) .",
    "thus , when the geometry on the timelike boundary is held fixed with line element given by ( [ intrin ] ) , the quasilocal dominant energy condition implies @xmath105 for linear perturbations from flat spacetime so long as the local dominant energy condition is everywhere satisfied .",
    "note , however , that the quasilocal energy condition need not hold for variations around vacuum solutions which do not extremize the hamiltonian . in particular , when both @xmath106 and @xmath107 are greater than zero , equation ( [ exam ] ) yields @xmath108 .",
    "also note that even though @xmath105 for linear perturbations from flat spacetime , the quasilocal energy associated with flat spacetime is neither a minimum nor a lower bound to the energies accessible with the boundary geometry ( [ intrin ] ) .",
    "in fact , if we allow for vacuum solutions with @xmath109 , the quasilocal energy is not bounded from below : @xmath110 as @xmath111 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we confine attention to solutions with @xmath112 , the quasilocal energy achieves a lower bound for the vacuum solution with @xmath113 .",
    "the quasilocal energy ( i.e. the classical value of the hamiltonian ) is not positive definite . nor is there any way to define a ground state such that the quasilocal energy of a given state relative to the ground is both positive definite and additive . in fact , it may be ( as in the example of section ( [ s5 ] ) ) that the set of quasilocal energies accessible to a system with a given boundary geometry is not bounded from below .    despite all this",
    ", we have demonstrated that a quasilocal dominant energy condition holds for linear perturbations around a ground state so long as the local dominant energy condition is everywhere satisfied .",
