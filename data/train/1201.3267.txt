    "for a number of years black - hole ( bh ) quasi - normal modes ( qnms ) have been of great interest to both gravitational theorists and gravitational wave experimentalists .",
    "qnms have been studied in the contexts of ringing of astrophysical bhs where qnms are relevant to gravitational wave astronomy @xcite , loop gravity interpretations @xcite , lower dimensional bhs @xcite , and in the ads / cft correspondence @xcite where bhs are thermal states in the field theory and their decays correspond to a decay of a perturbation of this state @xcite . as such , knowledge of qnms",
    "will provide an understanding of the stability of bhs against external perturbations ; where more recently the interest in the hawking radiation and qnms of bhs has stemmed from the idea that mini-@xmath3 scale bhs might be created in particle accelerators such as the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .",
    "qnm oscillations have been found in perturbation calculations of particles falling into schwarzschild @xcite and kerr bhs @xcite and in the collapse of a star to form a black hole @xcite .",
    "let us first recall that qnms are the damped , resonant , non - radial perturbations of bhs which are characterized by a spectrum of discrete , complex frequencies , with real part determining the oscillation frequency , and an imaginary part that determines the rate at which each mode is damped as a result of an emission .",
    "for a given kind of physical perturbation the complex frequencies are uniquely determined by the mass and angular momentum of the bh , the angular harmonic indices @xmath4 of the deformation , and the degree of the harmonic of the mode @xmath1 . as has been shown in many contexts ,",
    "the fundamental equations describing the perturbations of bhs can be reduced to a single second - order ordinary differential equation similar to the one - dimensional schrdinger equation for a particle encountering a potential barrier . however",
    ", the nature of the potential precludes an exact , closed - form solution in terms of known functions .",
    "that is , our equations for wave propagation reduce to @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a spatial co - ordinate .",
    "the bh event - horizon is mapped to @xmath7 in the radial co - ordinate , and the potential @xmath8 is a function of the spatial co - ordinate only .",
    "note that we have proceeded in the usual way by assuming a time dependence , @xmath9 .",
    "this separation is not restrictive since once we have a solution for eq.([eqn:101 ] ) , a general time dependent solution can be given as a continuous fourier transform of such a solution , where the form of eq.([eqn:101 ] ) parallels a normal mode analysis .",
    "we shall now restrict ourselves to asymptotically flat space - times such that the potential @xmath8 is positive and satisfies @xmath10 note that there exist no normal mode expansions for such systems since such potentials do not allow bound states . from the form of the potential in eq.([eqn:102 ] ) we have that near to the boundaries @xmath11 the solutions behave as plane waves , @xmath12 here in - going at the horizon means entering into the bh , whilst the qnm frequencies and the associated wave - functions @xmath13 ( which are the solutions to eq.([eqn:101 ] ) ) are the qnms specified by the boundary conditions of eq.([eqn:103 ] ) .",
    "the study of bh perturbations was initiated by regge and wheeler @xcite and extended by zerilli @xcite . following the work by vishveshwara @xcite , chandrasekhar and detweiler @xcite pioneered numerical methods for the study of qnms .",
    "more recently , semi - analytic methods have proven useful in the study of bh perturbations with the wkb(j ) method of schutz , iyer and will @xcite , and more recently the asymptotic iteration method ( aim ) of ciftci , hall and saad @xcite , which is a valuable tool for computing solutions to general second order ordinary differential equations .    in this note",
    "we extend to sixth order in the semi - analytic approximation the works of seidel and iyer @xcite , konoplya @xcite , iyer and will @xcite , and following the works of refs .",
    "@xcite , we extend to the fermion sector the kerr bh qnms . here",
    "we shall compare the results of direct numerical , wkb(j ) approximation and the aim computation of qnms of fermionic bh excitations in the kerr space - time .",
    "note that we shall assign @xmath14 and @xmath15 for the calculated qnm frequencies in this work , where this note is organised as follows : in sec.[sec:2 ] we shall give a brief overview of the newman - penrose ( np ) formalism @xcite and its application to the qnms of massless spin-@xmath16 fields .",
    "sec.[sec:3 ] and [ sec:4 ] contain reviews of the semi - analytic methods employed here , whilst sec.[sec:5 ] contains the numerical results of the qnms for spin-@xmath16 field in a kerr space - time , followed by a short discussion of these results .",
    "in order to develop a master equation as discussed in the previous section , for a fermion , we shall introduce the np formalism @xcite .",
    "let @xmath17 be a pseudo - riemannian manifold with metric @xmath18 of dimension @xmath1 , and denote the tangent space at @xmath19 by @xmath20 .",
    "a natural basis for @xmath20 is the set of co - ordinate partial derivatives @xmath21 , although we may choose a basis as we wish .",
    "therefore , we choose one which is orthonormal with the signature of the metric @xmath18 on @xmath22 , that is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a block diagonal matrix in the np formalism .",
    "a vector may be expressed as a linear combination of basis vectors such that @xmath25 and the operators @xmath26 are @xmath27 invertable matrices which satisfy , @xmath28 where latin letters index tetrad co - ordinates and greek letters index manifold co - ordinates .",
    "the operator @xmath29 , now called a _ vielbein _ , is a projection operator from the co - ordinate basis to the non - co - ordinate basis .",
    "the np formalism is a special case for the _ vielbein _ , or tetrad , formalism in which tensors defined on a space - time are projected on to a complete basis vector set at each point @xmath30 .",
    "this basis set is the set of complex null vectors @xmath31 and @xmath32 , of which @xmath33 and @xmath34 are real and @xmath35 and @xmath32 are complex conjugate . by the null condition of this basis vector set , it is clear that @xmath36 in addition",
    ", these basis vectors satisfy the orthogonality relations , @xmath37 as well as the normalisation conditions @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the corresponding fundamental matrix @xmath24 is @xmath40 to which there corresponds a basis , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 . when used to define directional derivatives we assign to each basis vector a special symbol , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "having developed the np formalism , we begin our analysis by considering the dirac equation in the null tetrad basis , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the covariant derivative taking the form @xmath51 the spin connection @xmath52 satisfies the _ vielbein _ ansatz , @xmath53 and @xmath54 with @xmath55 being the @xmath56 dirac matrix .",
    "note that the spin connection @xmath52 may be rewritten in terms of the affine connection as @xmath57 the spin connection becomes the affine metric connection under the following co - ordinate transformation , @xmath58    we shall focus our attention on the massless limit of eq.([eqn:202 ] ) , @xmath59 rewriting @xmath60 in terms of weyl spinnors @xmath13 and @xmath61 , that is , @xmath62 and substituting eq.([eqn:208 ] ) into eq.([eqn:207 ] ) yields the dynamical weyl spinor equations , @xmath63 in the chiral representation . @xmath64 and @xmath65 are pauli matrices , and @xmath50 and @xmath66 are the the covariant derivatives of @xmath67 and @xmath68,respectively .",
    "the pauli matrices take on new forms in the vielbein formalism for curved space - time , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , where @xmath73 are the vielbein basis elements and @xmath74 are pauli matrices .",
    "explicitly we find @xmath75    following the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , the covariant derivative of eqs.([eqn:207 ] ) and ( [ eqn:209 ] ) may be written as @xmath76    consider now the @xmath0-dimensional kerr background space - time with line element @xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 is the rotation parameter of the bh .",
    "it is useful to define @xmath81 and @xmath82 such that @xmath83 .",
    "the basis of the np formalism as defined on the kerr geometry as @xmath84 and @xmath85 we may now define the ricci rotation coefficients ( spin coefficients in that which follows ) with respect to the curved space - time , @xmath86 recall that the complex conjugate of any spin coefficient is obtained by replacing the numerical index @xmath87 with the value @xmath0 and vice versa @xcite .",
    "the resulting equations are @xmath88    it is clear that basis vectors are mapped to derivative operators when applied to the tangent space as tangent vectors to the wave - functions @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , we write @xmath90 where @xmath91 with @xmath92 , and @xmath93 .",
    "the spin coefficients are linear combinations of basis vectors in the np formalism .",
    "we may therefore express the collection of spin connections in terms metric tensor elements .",
    "we shall choose the representation of the spin connections so as to simplify the algebra .",
    "a suitable choice for this assignment of elements is @xmath94 which results in , @xmath95 now let @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 . following these assignments ,",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the dirac equations reduce to    [ eqn:214 ] @xmath100    using eq.([eqn:214 ] ) , we separate the dirac equation into radial and angular parts by making the ansatz :    [ eqn:215 ] @xmath101    substituting eq.([eqn:215 ] ) into eq.([eqn:214 ] ) yields ,    [ eqn:216 ] @xmath102    and    [ eqn:217 ] @xmath103    where @xmath104 .    decoupling eq.([eqn:216 ] ) yields , @xmath105 s _ { \\mp \\frac{1}{2 } } = 0 \\ ; , \\label{eqn:218}\\ ] ] where @xmath106 is the _ adjoint _ of @xmath107 under the replacement of @xmath108 by @xmath109 .",
    "similarly , decoupling eq.([eqn:217 ] ) yields , @xmath110 r_{- \\frac{1}{2 } } = 0 \\ ; , \\label{eqn:219}\\ ] ] and @xmath111 satisfies the complex conjugate relation .",
    "once decoupled , eqs.([eqn:218 ] ) and ( [ eqn:219 ] ) are eigenvalue equations with known eigenvalues @xmath112 and unknown eigen - functions @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "for the purpose of computing qnms we shall focus our interest on the radial equation for the spin-@xmath16 field .",
    "we map eq.([eqn:219 ] ) to the _ tortoise _ co - ordinate @xmath6 , @xmath115 where @xmath116 eliminates the co - ordinate singularity at the horizon .",
    "after this co - ordinate transformation , operators @xmath117 and @xmath118 simplify to ,    [ eqn:221 ] @xmath119    the assignments @xmath120 and @xmath121 , in conjunction with eq.([eqn:221 ] ) , lead to the new form of the radial equations    @xmath122    if we define , @xmath123 and combine eqs.([eqn:222a ] ) and ( [ eqn:222b ] ) we obtain @xmath124 which may be separated to yield @xmath125 with @xmath126 eq.([eqn:224 ] ) is now in the form of eq.([eqn:101 ] ) with a potential given by eq.([eqn:225 ] ) .",
    "eq.([eqn:224 ] ) is the qnm master equation for a spin-@xmath16 field in a kerr space - time . in the following two sections we shall review two semi - analytic approaches to solving these equations for an ultimate comparison with the direct numerical results of refs .",
    "we shall begin with the wkb(j ) approximation of schutz , iyer and will @xcite which is a general method for generating approximate solutions to ordinary linear second order differential equations and has been used extensively in various bh cases ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) . for",
    "further discussion of this method , see refs .",
    "we may use the wkb(j ) method to generate approximate solutions to differential equations of the form @xmath127 for a smooth function , at @xmath128 , @xmath129 with @xmath130 .",
    "now assume that @xmath60 has a mode expansion of the form , @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath133 tracks the order of the expansion . by substituting eq.([eqn:302 ] ) into eq.([eqn:301 ] ) , and equating powers of @xmath134 , yields @xmath135 and @xmath136 where the two choices in sign in eq.([eqn:303 ] ) correspond to either incoming or outgoing waves at @xmath11 .",
    "when @xmath137 , @xmath138 such that @xmath139 for the outgoing wave to infinity and @xmath140 for the incoming wave from infinity . similarly , for @xmath141 , @xmath139 for the wave incoming from @xmath141 , while @xmath142 to a wave outgoing to @xmath141 , see fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "designating these four solutions , @xmath143        the general solutions to regions i and iii are @xmath144 where @xmath145 .",
    "the amplitudes at @xmath146 are related to amplitudes at @xmath7 through the linear relation @xmath147 we match the solutions in regions i and iii with a solution in region ii through the two turning points of @xmath148 . if the turning points are closely spaced ( @xmath149 ) , then the solution in region ii can be well approximated by a taylor series expansion , @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the location of the maximum of the function @xmath152 and the prime notation signifies differentiation with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "we shall assign @xmath153 in what follows .",
    "region ii corresponds to @xmath154 we introduce new functions @xmath155 rewriting eq.([eqn:301 ] ) as @xmath156 which has , is terms of parabolic cylinder functions @xmath157 , the general solution @xmath158 it can be shown that the large @xmath159 asymptotics of this solution give an @xmath160-matrix , @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the gamma function and @xmath163 is a general exponential function depending on the nature of the potential @xmath164 .",
    "when expanding to higher orders , the @xmath160 matrix has the same general form as shown in eq.([eqn:314 ] ) , with modified expressions for the off - diagonal elements .",
    "note that for a bh no waves are reflected by the horizon , such that @xmath165 , and due to the qnm boundary conditions there are no waves incoming from infinity , @xmath166 .",
    "these conditions are satisfied in eq.([eqn:307 ] ) only if @xmath167 .",
    "consequently , @xmath168 , and @xmath169 the above equation gives the quantisation condition which labels qnms by an overtone number @xmath170 . since the coefficients in the @xmath160-matrix that connect amplitudes near the horizon with those at infinity depend only on @xmath171 ( related to the overtone number @xmath1 ) , we need only expand eq.([eqn:302 ] ) to higher orders in @xmath134 to obtain the wkb formula to higher orders .",
    "the result has the form @xmath172 where the correction terms @xmath173 can be found in ref . @xcite and the included url .",
    "our second semi - analytic technique is the aim , which produces an exact solution to an ordinary second order partial differential equation under the assumption that the coefficients in the taylor expansion of the differential equation form an asymptotic series . to see this ,",
    "consider the homogeneous linear second - order differential equation for the function @xmath174 , @xmath175 where @xmath176 and @xmath177 are functions in @xmath178 . in order to find a general solution to this equation we rely on the symmetric structure of the right - hand side of eq.([eqn:401 ] ) @xcite . if we differentiate eq.([eqn:401 ] ) with respect to @xmath6 , we find that @xmath179 where @xmath180 and @xmath181 . taking the second derivative of eq.([eqn:401 ] ) yields @xmath182 where @xmath183 , and @xmath181 .",
    "the @xmath184 and the @xmath185 derivatives , @xmath186 , are found iteratively , @xmath187 the crucial observation in the aim is that differentiating the above equation @xmath1 times with respect to @xmath6 , leaves a symmetric form for the right hand side : @xmath188 where ,    [ eqn:404 ] @xmath189 and @xmath190    for sufficiently large @xmath1 @xmath191 where from the ratio of the @xmath184 and the @xmath185 derivatives , we have @xmath192 this then yields , @xmath193 where @xmath194 is the integration constant and the right - hand side of eq.([eqn:404 ] ) and the definition of @xmath195 have been used . substituting this into eq.([eqn:402 ] ) , we obtain the first - order differential equation @xmath196 the general solution can be determined as @xcite @xmath197 \\left ( c_{2 } + c_{1 } \\int^{x } d x ' \\exp { \\int^{x ' } d x''\\left [ \\lambda_{0 } ( x'')+ 2 \\beta ( x '' ) \\right ] } \\right ) } \\ ; . \\label{eqn:409}\\ ] ] the integration constants , @xmath194 and @xmath198 , can be determined by an appropriate choice of normalisation . note that for the generation of exact solutions @xmath199 .",
    "eq.([eqn:405 ] ) gives the sequence termination condition , @xmath200 which is also the qnm `` quantisation condition '' as given in ref .",
    "note that the sequence termination condition is true only at a particular value @xmath1 since there is no guarantee that the sequence @xmath201 is truly asymptotic .",
    "improvements to the efficiency of the aim have been made which eliminates the need to take derivatives at each step in the iteration process , thereby reducing the computational overhead while also improving the overall accuracy of the method .",
    "this is done by reducing the aim to a set of recursion relations which no longer involve differentiation . for more details on this improved aim",
    "see ref . @xcite .",
    ".__the qnm frequencies for the spin-@xmath16 perturbation of the kerr bh with rotation parameter @xmath202 , which is the schwarzschild limit . _ _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     tables [ tab:1 ] , [ tab:2 ] , [ tab:3 ] , [ tab:4 ] and [ tab:5 ] constitute the main results of this paper , and contain the numerically computed qnm frequencies for varying values of the bh rotation parameter @xmath203 , along with the semi - analytic wkb(j ) ( to third and sixth order ) and aim results . in each case , and where numerical results were available , they were compared with the semi - analytic solutions , these numerical results were taken from refs . @xcite . at this point",
    "we re - iterate that we have set @xmath204 and @xmath15 .",
    "note that in the absence of numerical results , qnm frequencies calculated using the sixth order wkb(j ) method were compared to the values from the aim .",
    "unlike earlier cases , such as the case of scalar perturbations , previously published numerical values exist for the qnm frequencies that result from spin - half perturbations of a kerr bh @xcite , at least for the angular numbers of @xmath205 and @xmath206 . in comparing these numerical results ,",
    "the accuracy of the wkb(j ) method was worst ( relative to the pure numerical evaluation ) for parameter values @xmath207 , with approximate errors of @xmath208 at third order and @xmath209 at sixth order , and showed steady improvement in accuracy with increasing @xmath2 and @xmath1 , to @xmath210 at third order and @xmath211 at sixth order .",
    "however , the aim method experienced degraded accuracy with increasing @xmath2 and @xmath1 at @xmath212 , ranging from @xmath213 at @xmath214 to @xmath215 at @xmath216 .",
    "however , the accuracy of the aim was at its highest when @xmath217 was at its lowest , @xmath1 was at its lowest and @xmath2 was at its highest .",
    "note that this for an iterative of only 15 , though with this iterative depth the aim was still significantly slower that the sixth order wkb(j ) method .    for the qnm frequencies when",
    "@xmath218 and @xmath219 , the aim values were then compared to the sixth order wkb(j ) method values . in these cases",
    "the accuracy of the aim , as compared to the sixth order wkb(j ) method was at its highest when @xmath1 was at its lowest and the @xmath2 values were higher , such as @xmath220 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 , @xmath223 and @xmath224 . once again , numerical processors did evaluate significantly faster for the sixth order wkb(j ) method than for the aim .    in conclusion , we have , using the np formalism , developed the dirac equation in a kerr background in a pedagogical manner . using this result",
    "we have applied two semi - analytic techniques to calculate the qnm frequencies for comparison with available numerical results @xcite finding that the computational overhead for the wkb(j ) method is lower at low @xmath1 than for the aim .",
    "as such the wkb(j ) method executes considerably more quickly than the aim .",

    "<S> it was found that the wkb(j ) method and aim show good agreement with direct numerical solutions for low values of the overtone number @xmath1 and angular quantum number @xmath2 . </S>"
