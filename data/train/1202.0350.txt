    "major western boundary currents in the ocean are meandering jets separating water masses with different physical and biogeochemical characteristics .",
    "the prominent examples are the gulf stream in the atlantic ocean and the kuroshio in the pacific ocean . these and similar `` heat engines '' define the climate in large regions of the planet .",
    "similar jets in the stratosphere play important role in transport and distribution of chemical substances . from the hydrodynamic point of view",
    ", they may be considered as jet flows with running waves of different wave lengths and phase velocities imposed .",
    "the simplest kinematic model of such a flow is a two - dimensional jet of an ideal fluid with a given velocity profile that is perturbed by an amplitude - modulated wave traveling from the west to the east .",
    "the problem of transport and mixing of passive scalars in meandering jets has been considered by many authors in the context of atmospheric and oceanic physics @xcite .",
    "the typical phase portrait ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) consists of two chains of circulations with a zigzag - like jet between them and resembles the phase portrait of a particle in the field of two running waves . in the frame",
    "moving with the velocity of one of the waves , the problem is topologically equivalent to the motion of a periodically perturbed nonlinear physical pendulum that is known to demonstrate chaotic oscillations @xcite .",
    "different aspects of chaotic mixing of passive particles in meandering jets in the atmosphere and the ocean have been studied in the papers @xcite .    in the paper we focus on topological and statistical aspects of the chaotic transport and mixing in a specific kinematic model of an eastward meandering jet which has been introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite some years ago .",
    "we are motivated by the desire to get a more deep insight into the evolution of material lines in the flow and to establish a connection between dynamical , topological and statistical characteristics of the flow .",
    "the equations of motion of passive particles advected by a planar incompressible flow is known to have a hamiltonian form @xmath0 with the streamfunction @xmath1 playing the role of a hamiltonian and the coordinates @xmath2 of a particle being canonically conjugated variables .",
    "thus , nonstationary two - dynamical advection is equivalent to a hamiltonian system with one and half degrees of freedom whose phase space coincides with its configuration space .",
    "this property is very useful in visualizing geometric invariant sets in real and numerical experiments .",
    "to be specific we consider a two - dimensional bickley jet with the velocity profile @xmath3 whose argument is modulated by a zonal running wave @xcite .",
    "the streamfunction in the fixed frame reference is the following : @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are amplitude , wavenumber and phase velocity respectively , @xmath8 is a measure of the jet s width . after introducing the following notations : @xmath9 and @xmath10 we get the advection equations ( [ 1 ] ) in the frame moving with the phase velocity @xmath7 : @xmath11    ) in the frame moving with the meander s phase velocity @xmath7 . ]",
    "the respective streamfunction @xmath12 has three normalized control parameters : @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the jet s width , meander s amplitude and its phase velocity .",
    "the scaling chosen results in translational invariance of the phase portrait along the @xmath16-axis with the period @xmath17 .    the detailed analysis of stationary points and bifurcations of eqs . ( [ 11 ] ) has been done in ref .",
    "stationary points may exist only under the condition @xmath18 .",
    "there are four stationary points , two of them are always stable and the other ones are stable under the condition @xmath19 . if the additional condition @xmath20 is fulfilled , there are additional four unstable saddle points . resuming one gets :    1 .",
    "@xmath21 , there are no stationary points . 2 .",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 , there are two centers and two saddles with two separatrices connecting the saddles .",
    "there are two separatrices each of which passes through its own saddle .",
    "the jet between the separatrices is westward .",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 , the jet is eastward with the same stationary points as in the case 2 .",
    "@xmath26 , there are eight stationary points and two separatrices .",
    "there are two separatrices , each of which connects two saddle points .",
    "the jet is westward .",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath25 , the jet is eastward with the same stationary points as in the case 4 .",
    "therefore , from the point of view of existence and stability of stationary states , there are three possibilities : 1 ) there are no stationary points ; 2 ) there are four stationary points , two centers and two saddles ; 3 ) there are eight stationary points , four centers and four saddles .",
    "a bifurcation between the first and second regimes consists in arising two pairs `` saddle - center '' .",
    "a bifurcation between the second and third regimes consists in arising two saddles and a center between them instead of one saddle ( a fork - type bifurcation ) .",
    "there is one more bifurcation that does not change the number and stability of stationary points but changes the topology of the flow .",
    "the values of the streamfunction on the separatrices are equal on modulo but of opposite signs .",
    "there is a critical value of the phase velocity @xmath28 under which the separatrices coincide and the respective streamfunction is equal to zero . if @xmath29 , a free flow between the separatrices is westward , whereas with @xmath30 it is eastward .",
    "it is difficult to find @xmath28 analytically but it may be shown @xcite that @xmath31 , if @xmath32 otherwise @xmath33 .",
    "the respective phase portraits are typical with hamiltonian systems with running waves in shear flows @xcite . in dependence on the values of the phase velocity @xmath15",
    "one can get different topologies : a homoclinic connection , a heteroclinic connection and a separatrix reconnection .",
    "being motivated by eastward jet currents in the ocean and atmosphere , we deal in this paper with the case  3 ( see the phase portrait in fig .",
    "streamlines with the streamfunction ( [ 12 ] ) , that is time - independent in the moving frame , are shown in fig .",
    "1 . the plot demonstrates three different regions of the flow : a central eastward jet ( j ) , north and south circulations ( c ) and peripheral westward currents ( p ) .",

    "no exchange between the north and south circulations is possible in the unperturbed system .",
    "even the simplest periodic perturbation of the meander s amplitude , @xmath36 , results in spitting stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle points .",

    "2 the poincar section of the perturbed flow .",
    "the control parameters throughout the paper are chosen as follows : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",

    "particles , belonging to these islands , rotate around the elliptic point of the vortex core . zoom of the section nearby two of the islands is shown in fig .",
    "the feature we want to pay attention to is a stickiness to the boundaries of the vortex core and of the islands that is visualized by increasing the density of points near the respective boundaries .",

    "superdiffusion occurs when particles in the jet travel long distances between sticking events .",

    "all the unstable invariant sets are known to possess stable and unstable manifolds . when time progresses particle s trajectories nearby a stable manifold of an invariant set tend to approach the set whereas the trajectories close to an unstable manifold go away from the set .",

    "we follow the methodology of our works @xcite and compute the time @xmath69 , particles spend in the neighbor circulation zones @xmath74 before reaching the critical lines @xmath75 , and the number of times @xmath68 they wind crossing the lines @xmath76 . in the upper panel in fig .",
    "7 the functions @xmath77 and @xmath78 are shown .",
    "the upper parts of each function ( with @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) represent the results for the particles with initial positive zonal velocities which they have simply due to their locations on the material line at @xmath72 .",
