    "<S> the polarization of produced hyperons would be smaller than in the exclusive recombination but should be proportional to @xmath101 .    the extreme limit of inclusive recombination is fragmentation of polarized quarks , @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> longitudinal polarization of hyperons in a similar process @xmath112 has been measured @xcite and can be explained @xcite by assuming that polarized hyperons contain the initial polarized leading quark in its su(6 ) wavefunction . </S>",
    "<S> one can similarly calculate hyperon polarization from fragmentation of transversely polarized quarks and obtain , @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the strange quark abundances relative to up or down quarks in qgp and quark fragmentation , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> including production of unpolarized hyperons in the process , the effective hyperon polarization from fragmentation of polarized quarks should increase with the fractional momentum @xmath116 .    </S>",
    "<S> because of the complication from hadronization , we can not provide a model independent estimate of the final hyperon polarization . </S>",

    "<S> according to our estimate following eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : pq ] ) , this would be in the order of tens of a percent and the hyperons polarization would be around the same order . </S>",
    "<S> we can also provide other qualitative predictions of the global hyperon polarization @xmath117 in non - central heavy - ion collisions : ( 1 ) hyperons and their anti - particles are similarly polarized along the same direction perpendicular to the reaction plane in non - central heavy - ion collisions . ( 2 ) the global hyperon polarization @xmath117 vanishes in central collisions and increases almost linearly with @xmath34 in semi - central collisions . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) it should have a finite value at small @xmath118 and in the central rapidity region . </S>",

    "<S> ( 4 ) high @xmath119 quarks should not be polarized by parton scattering in the medium . </S>",
    "<S> however , hyperon polarization should persist at moderate @xmath118 where recombination of unpolarized high @xmath118 quarks with polarized thermal quarks may still dominate . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization can be estimated within a recombination model . </S>",
    "<S> ( 5 ) since hyperon s production planes are randomly oriented with respect to the reaction plane of heavy - ion collisions , the observed hyperon polarization in @xmath1 collisions should not contribute to the global polarization as we have defined here , except at large rapidity region where directed flow is observed @xcite . in this region , </S>",
    "<S> the non - vanishing @xmath120 can provide an average production plane @xmath121 for hyperons . according to the observed polarization pattern in @xmath1 @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the global @xmath122 will be enhanced for @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 and reduced for @xmath8 in large rapidity region . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , one also expects @xmath123 due to the directed flow .    in principle , hadronic interaction with a given direction of relative o.a.m . </S>",
    "<S> can also lead to global hyperon polarization . </S>",
    "<S> neglecting hyperon production in the hadronic phase , the dominant hadronic processes involving hyperons will be hyperon-@xmath124 scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering amplitude in general involves both scalar and vector channels @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one can show that global hyperon polarization from the vector channel is along while polarizations from the scalar channel and all the interferences are against the global quark polarization . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , polarizations from different channels in hyperon-@xmath124 scattering partially cancel each other . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the transverse gradient of the longitudinal flow should be significantly reduced in the hadronic phase due to prior strong transverse expansion in the reaction plane as demonstrated by the large elliptic flow measured at rhic . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the net effect of hadronic interaction should be small and should not change the final hyperon polarization significantly , in particular at large @xmath118 </S>",
    "<S> . we will leave detailed study to future work .    in summary , produced partons </S>",
    "<S> are shown to have large local relative o.a.m . in non - central heavy - ion collisions if quark - gluon plasma is formed . </S>",
    "<S> parton scattering with given relative o.a.m . </S>",
    "<S> is shown to polarize quarks along the same direction due to spin - orbital coupling . </S>",
    "<S> such global quark polarization has many measurable consequences in high - energy heavy - ion collisions . within different hadronization scenarios </S>",
    "<S> , we predict that hyperons will be polarized along the opposite direction of the reaction plane . </S>",
