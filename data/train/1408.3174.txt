    "many spatial processes show non - stationary behavior in the correlation function across space .",
    "therefore various non - stationary models are proposed in the literature to deal with this non - stationarity .",
    "a classical work in this area is @xcite which utilizes non - parametric _ space transformations _ of the space where the process is transformed into another space where the process is almost isotropy . in the presence of wind , we can expect a specific type of non - stationarity in which the correlation is larger between a pair of points along the wind direction ( angle=0 ) and lower between a pair of points perpendicular to the wind direction ( with the same distance as before ) .",
    "we can also expect that this non - stationarity varies smoothly as we vary the angle from 0 to @xmath0 .",
    "in this work using an intuitively appealing space transformation which satisfies the aforementioned expectation we derive the exact form of the covariance function for a wind of given velocity and direction ( section [ sect : covariance - derivation ] ) .",
    "it turns out that the covariance function is an anisotropic covariance function ( see @xcite ) of a specific form which we calculate here .",
    "we denote the wind speed vector by @xmath1 and assume it is constant across the domain we consider . here",
    "we only consider a 2-dimensional vector but it is possible to extend this method to 3 dimensions ( and more ) .",
    "we denote the magnitude of the wind by @xmath2 and its angle with the @xmath3 axis by @xmath4 .",
    "it is useful to consider a new set of coordinates with the same origin and x - axis with the same direction as wind and y - axis perpendicular to it .",
    "we denote the coordinates of a point @xmath5 in the original plane by @xmath6 and in the new coordinates which we call the _",
    "wind coordinates_. the idea of the method is depicted in figure [ wind_cov_construct.pdf ] where the original space is considered to be the circle depicted in bold and the deformed space is given with in dashed . in the new space",
    "the transformed pair of points for which the connecting line segment is parallel to the wind direction are closer than the original space .",
    "we can find the transformation to achieve this result by stretching and rotation of the space in three steps : ( 1 ) rotate the space counterclockwise with the angle @xmath4 to find the coordinates of the points in the wind coordinates ; ( 2 ) stretch the space along the wind axes ; ( 3 ) rotate back the results to the get the value of the transformation in the original space .",
    "let us denote the counter - clockwise rotation matrix of angle @xmath4 by @xmath7 which is given by @xmath8    also let @xmath9 denote the magnitude of the _ stretch _ parallel to the wind direction and perpendicular to it respectively .",
    "denote its matrix by @xmath10 which is given by @xmath11 suppose @xmath5 is given in the original space with @xmath6 denoting the same point in the wind coordinates : @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the matrix transpose operation .",
    "we assume that the point @xmath5 is stretched along the axes of the wind coordinates : @xmath14 we are interested to find the transformation formula in the original space . in order to do so",
    ", we find the coordinates of @xmath6 in the original space . to that end , we can apply the rotation @xmath15 ( where @xmath13 denotes matrix transpose ) .",
    "hence by equation [ eqn - trans ] , the above mapping can be written in the original space as @xmath16 by multiplying @xmath17 to the two sides , we can write the above mapping in the original space as @xmath18    we call @xmath19 the _ relative stretch _ parameter . then we can write @xmath20 we denote @xmath21 by @xmath22 $ ] which is a symmetric matrix .",
    "the hope is that the covariance in the new space has a simple form so that after applying this transformation , we can model the covariance appropriately using a simple model .",
    "we assume that in the new space the covariance is isotropic , i.e. it is only a function of the euclidean distance .",
    "the euclidean distance between two points is given by @xmath23 which in the original space is equal to @xmath24 where @xmath25 however as indicated we would like to use the euclidean distance in the new space as the distance used in isotropic covariance models : @xmath26^ta[\\gamma ] } { \\bf h}.\\ ] ] note that @xmath27^ta[\\gamma ] = r(\\theta_0 ) s(\\gamma,1 ) r(\\theta_0)^tr(\\theta_0 ) s(\\gamma,1 ) r(\\theta_0)^t= a[\\gamma^2]\\ ] ]    as an example consider a gaussian covariance function : @xmath28 the new covariance function is given by @xmath29{\\bf h})/(\\phi b^2)),\\ ] ] which implies that the parameter @xmath30 is not identifiable and can be absorbed into the range parameter @xmath31 by the change of variables @xmath32 to arrive at the anisotropy covariance function : @xmath33{\\bf h}/\\phi).\\ ] ] figure [ wind_cov_example.pdf ] depicts the application of this method to the exponential covariance function @xmath34",
    "we obtained a simple covariance function which achieves higher spatial correlation for pairs of points in the direction of wind and lower for pairs which are perpendicular and give the closed - form formula .",
    "it turns out that the covariance function is anisotropy and except for the wind angle depends on only one other parameter which we called the relative stretch parameter , @xmath35 .",
    "the relative stretch can be considered to be a function of the wind speed for modeling , for example by letting @xmath36 . in that case @xmath37",
    "correspond to no stretch case which is also the case when the wind speed is zero ( @xmath38 ) as desired .",
    "@xmath39 corresponds to a stretch perpendicular to the wind vector and @xmath40 corresponds to a stretch parallel to the wind vector .",
    "the same formulation can be used for transforming a kernel for averaging a predictor such as a traffic variable which is a proxy for pollution source emission . in that context",
    "we can transform an isotropic kernel ( with circle contours ) which is utilized for averaging the source effect around a given spatial point @xmath41 to a kernel which is directed parallel to the wind ( with ellipse contours ) at that point .",
    "the resulting kernel in that case will have exactly the same form as we discussed here .    .",
