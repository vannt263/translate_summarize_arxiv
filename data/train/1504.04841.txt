    "we shall see that whenever a pointwise bound as @xmath40 in compact subsets of @xmath23 for nonnegative solutions of exists , then @xmath32 or @xmath33 ( or both ) are heat bounded as @xmath40 .",
    "the literature on scalar and systems of parabolic _ equations _ is quite vast .",
    "a good source for this material is the book @xcite .",
    "however , very little attention has been paid to systems of parabolic _ inequalities _ , and , as far as we know , all results deal with a very different aspect of these inequalities ; namely the nonexistence of global solutions .",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "let us mention some of the methods and tools we use to study question 1 .",
    "first and most noteworthy of these are some new results for linear and nonlinear heat potentials . to motivate them recall that if @xmath42 , @xmath43 , is a nonnegative measurable function , @xmath44 is a constant , and @xmath45 is a fundamental solution of @xmath46 in @xmath24 then the riesz potential of @xmath5 is given by the convolution @xmath47 it has been extensively studied because of its usefulness in potential theory and the study of elliptic pdes . see for example the books @xcite .",
    "three important results concerning the riesz potential operator , which are relevant to this paper , are hedberg s inequality @xcite ; the hardy - littlewood - sobolev inequality ( see @xcite ) ; and estimates for the nonlinear potential @xmath48 first studied in @xcite . a crucial tool for the proofs of these results is the celebrated hardy - littlewood maximal function inequalities ( see @xcite ) .    in our study of question 1 there arises naturally the need to obtain similar results for the convolution @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath25 , is a nonnegative measurable function , @xmath51 is a constant , and @xmath52 is the fundamental solution of the heat operator given by . these new results for the heat potential operator are stated and proved in section [ sec3 ] using a modified version of the hardy - littlewood maximal function inequalities in which euclidean balls in @xmath24 are replaced with heat balls in @xmath53 .",
    "two other tools required are a moser type iteration ( see lemma [ lem4.6 ] ) and a representation formula given in lemma [ lem4.1 ] for nonnegative super temperatures which is the parabolic analog of the brezis - lions representation formula @xcite for nonnegative superharmonic functions .",
    "in this section we state our results for question 1",
    ". we can assume without loss of generality that @xmath54 .",
