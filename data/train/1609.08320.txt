    "synchronized activity of the nonlinear oscillators has been observed in a wide variety of the physical and biological systems .",
    "coordination of the activity of the populations of nonlinear oscillators can enhance their collective output which has been exploited by different biological and technological systems @xcite .",
    "for example synchronized neurons produce different vital rhythms @xcite or they impact the target nervous systems with stronger signals @xcite .",
    "coordination of the activity of nonlinear oscillators might arise from the connections between the oscillators and/or through common external drives @xcite .",
    "presence of common source leads to statistical correlations between the inputs to the oscillators which increases interdependency of their activity and might lead to synchrony when the inputs are identical @xcite . in a realistic system ,",
    "the transmission of the signals from common sources to the system are of finite speed and consequently the inclusion of the different transmission times are necessary if the common source is not of equal distance to the system constituent units . in this case , the input cross - correlation function for every pair of oscillators peaks in a finite time lag . in this study we aimed to inspect the effect of this input finite time shift on the output correlation function of two oscillators .",
    "the results for uncoupled oscillators expectedly show that the effect of such input time lag is a shift in the output cross - correlation function . for coupled oscillators ,",
    "inputs time - lag non - trivially affects the output correlation function and besides the shift , the maximum correlation is itself dependent to the input time lag .",
    "by analytical calculations and numerical experiments we have shown that the degree of synchrony is dependent to the time - lag of shared inputs and maximum synchrony could be attained when the common inputs to the neurons are ( differentially ) shifted by a non - zero time lag .",
    "we consider two bidirectionally coupled oscillators with state vector @xmath0 , @xmath1 which evolves according to @xmath2 where vector function @xmath3 describes the inherent dynamic of the isolated oscillators with @xmath4 being a current - like scalar parameter which determines the bifurcation of the oscillators from stationary to oscillatory regimes .",
    "we assume that with @xmath5 isolated oscillators have a stable limit cycle @xmath6 with period @xmath7 a decreasing function of @xmath8 once @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath9 determines the interaction function whose strength is controlled by @xmath10 and acts through delay time @xmath11 .",
    "the last terms in the equations describe common stochastic input to the two oscillators where @xmath12 is gaussian white noise with zero mean and unit variance and @xmath13 determines the noise intensity .",
    "@xmath14 is the key parameter of the present study which determines the time shift between the two stochastic inputs , i.e. , the second neuron receives the same input but before the time lag @xmath14 . both the interaction term and stochastic inputs are scaled with the small parameter @xmath15 . furthermore the oscillators are assumed to be in general nonidentical due to the small difference in their bifurcation parameter @xmath16 .",
    "applying the standard phase reduction method in the regime of weak perturbation @xcite leads to the following @xmath17 stochastic differential equations , for the time evolution of the phase variable @xmath18 in the vicinity of the unperturbed limit cycle @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the phase sensitivity @xcite .",
    "since we assumed small inhomogeneity in the bifurcation parameter @xmath22 , difference in natural frequencies will be also small @xmath23 .",
    "we take @xmath24 and @xmath25 and define time - shifted phase difference as @xmath26 . from eqs .",
    "[ ophase ] we obtain the evolution of @xmath27 to the order of @xmath28 @xmath29 here @xmath30 $ ] and @xmath31 .",
    "we assume @xmath32 where the first term @xmath33 captures the intrinsic dynamics of isolated oscillators and the second term is slow varying deviation from natural oscillations .",
    "averaging the equation over one period @xcite , we have @xmath34 where @xmath35 and the averaged functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 are defined as @xmath38 and @xmath39 ^ 2}$ ] .",
    "note that in the above equation the lag in the common inputs @xmath40 acts like delay in the connections with a change of variable @xmath41 .",
    "we finally derive the fokker - planck equation for the distribution of the phase differences of the two oscillators , described by eq .",
    "[ phi_2 ] @xmath42 \\nonumber \\\\ & + &   \\varepsilon   \\frac{\\partial ^{2}}{\\partial \\varphi ^{2 } } \\big ( \\bar{f}(\\varphi - \\tau _ { s } )   \\rho\\left ( \\phi , t \\right)\\big )      \\label{fokker}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 depicts the distribution of @xmath45 .",
    "the stationary distribution of the phase differences can be calculated by letting @xmath46 @xmath47 \\label{stationary}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is a normalization factor .",
    "in the following the analytical results are obtained by calculation of the stationary distribution function from the above equation ( see supplementary material for the details of derivations ) .    to check the validity of the eq .  4 and the corresponding solution of fokker - planck equation eq .  6 ,",
    "we take @xmath50 which is the canonical form of the phase sensitivity for the type - i oscillators near snic bifurcation @xcite . furthermore",
    ", we assume the oscillators are pulse - coupled , i.e. , @xmath51 in which @xmath52 is dirac s delta function and @xmath53 is the instant of @xmath54 .",
    "pulse coupling approximation for interaction between oscillators is valid in the systems where the interaction term activates over a time which is small compared to period of the oscillation @xcite . to assess the degree of synchrony regardless of the value of the phase lag we use the synchronization index @xmath55 , where the brackets denote the averaging over time @xcite .",
    "first , we considered two uncoupled oscillators receiving a common noise with a time shift @xmath40 . for the identical oscillators",
    "@xmath56 , it has been shown that the oscillators synchronize when receiving common noises @xcite .",
    "our results show that time shift in the inputs results in the same time shift in the synchronized output without changing the synchrony index ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]a and fig .  [ index ] ) . when the oscillators are not identical @xmath57 , phase difference distribution function spreads and synchrony index decreases ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b and fig .  [ index ] ) . in the presence of heterogeneity ( mismatch of the firing rates )",
    "the most probable phase lag @xmath58 is not zero when the inputs have zero time - shift @xcite .",
    "interestingly this effect of heterogeneity can be compensated by a non - zero time shift in the inputs , i.e. , the most probable phase difference of the oscillators could be around zero despite the heterogeneity by a suitable choice of the time lag of inputs ( see fig .",
    "1b with @xmath59 and fig .",
    "[ index]b ) .",
    "this means that the maximum zero - lag correlation of the two non - identical oscillators is achieved when the input to the high - frequency oscillator is lagged .",
    "note that in this case changing the lag in the inputs does not change the functional form of the distribution function and so the synchrony index .    unlike the case of uncoupled oscillators the effect of time lag in the inputs to the coupled oscillators is not restricted to the shift of the distribution of the phase lags . for a system of two coupled oscillators , two cases can be recognized .",
    "in the first case ( locked mode ) the deterministic version of eq .  4 ( with no stochastic input ) has a stable fixed point , and in the second case there is no fixed point for eq .  4 and the system is in the _ running mode_. the effect of common inputs in these two cases",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a and b , respectively . in the locked mode",
    "the synchrony index is no longer independent of the time lag of the inputs and peaks when the time lag coincides with the phase lag of deterministic case ( fig .",
    "[ index ] ) .",
    "accordingly , while the location of the peak of the distribution function shifts with changing input time lag , its maximum value and the width of the distribution around the most probable phase lag also changes ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) .",
    "analytical results obtained by the solving the stationary fokker - planck equation ( eq .  6 ) confirm the results of the simulation .    in the running mode",
    "the results are qualitatively similar to the locked mode except for the overall decrease in the synchrony index and wider distribution of the phase differences ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]b and fig .  [ index ] ) .",
    "changing the time - lag of the inputs the distribution is shifted while its width and maximum are changed .",
    "again , the best entrainment with the maximum synchrony index is attained in a certain value of time lag of the inputs ( @xmath60 , see fig .",
    "[ fig2]b and fig .  [ index ] ) .",
    "analytical results from eq .",
    "6 are again validated by the direct numeric solution of eq .",
    "3 .        in summary",
    ", we have studied the synchronization of two limit cycle oscillators when the oscillators receive the common stochastic input with different time lags , i.e. , the input to one of the oscillators is the same input to the other but shifted in time .",
    "we have shown that for uncoupled oscillators the effect of time lag is a trivial shift in the distribution of the phase difference of the two oscillators but when oscillators are coupled , input time lag changes the distribution of relative phases and so the degree of synchronization between the oscillators . specifically with a _ good _ time lag around which the stochastic inputs accord with the most probable phase difference between the oscillators due to their deterministic dynamics , a resonance - like effect could be observed and the oscillators are more strongly phase locked .",
