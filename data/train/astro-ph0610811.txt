    "the mercury - manganese ( hgmn ) stars are a class of non - magnetic peculiar main sequence b type stars with effective temperatures between 10500 k and 15000 k. their members show a wide variety of abundance anomalies with both depletions ( e.g. , n , * ? ? ?",

    "the npoi functions as a two to six element optical interferometer .",
    "the individual elements are siderostats with a 35 cm unvignetted aperture .",
    "the siderostats feed the light into evacuated pipes which send the light to a beam combining optical table .",

    "the fdl s and the beam combining table serve as the npoi s correlator .",
    "after combination spectrometers disperse the light which is collected onto lenslet arrays .",
    "these arrays feed the light to banks of avalanche photo diodes ( apd ) via fiber optic cables .",
    "npoi observations before 2001 used 32 channels across a 4500 - 8500   bandwidth .",

    "these relative astrometric solutions were used to solve for the orbital elements which are shown in table  [ ephem ] .    a combined solution of the orbital elements using the npoi astrometric positions and the single lined radial velocity curve of @xcite was performed .",

    "the npoi generally has a better sensitivity in the red as opposed to the blue end and we expect that systematic effects ultimately limit our errors to the level of @xmath0 5% for the magnitude difference independent of wavelength .",
    "recent tests , conducted after these observations , show that our wavelength calibration for the 2005 observations may have been off by 2 to 8 nm in several channels .",
    "residual calibration errors may also contribute to the error budget .",

    "corresponds to an error in the measured squared visibilities of less than 3% .",
    "the magnitude differences of 2.57 at 5500  and 2.39 at 7000(v and r bands , respectively ) allowed us to predict the secondary s spectral type as a8 , using table 15.7 of @xcite assuming both stars are on the main sequence . using the same table in @xcite we see that the magnitude differences in v for a b8v@xmath18a5v binary is 2.2 and for a b8v@xmath18f0v binary it is 3.0 .",

    "this illustrates the npoi s capability to determine the the spectral type of the secondary of  at the level of a few spectral subtypes .",
    "using the hipparcos parallax and the orbital elements in table  [ ephem ] we determined the sum of the masses to be 4.7 @xmath0 0.6 m@xmath14 .",
    "the dominant source of error in the sum of the masses is the uncertainty of the parallax .",
    "if the parallax were perfectly known we would know the mass sum to approximately 3% .",

    "the expected diameters for the two components from @xcite are too small to resolve with the npoi configurations used in this study .",
    "using the mass sum from the dynamical parallax and the mass function of @xcite of 5.4@xmath1910@xmath20 we can estimate the individual stellar masses .",

    "these masses are too large for a b8v and too small for an a8v @xcite . using the tight mass@xmath9luminosity relationship and a bolometric correction of @xmath90.75 for the primary",
    "we expect a b8v to have a mass closer to 3.1 m@xmath21 which raises the secondary mass to 1.6 m@xmath21 .",

    "it would be difficult to find them if the s / n ratios were much less than 300 at the resolution of the dao long coud camera .",

    "the light contribution of the secondary to the joint spectra varies with wavelength , being for example , 7.9% at @xmath104032 and 9% at @xmath105360 .",
    "one can correct the spectrum for its effects either before or after the measurement . with rectified spectra",

    "( 2001 ) and from the sun @xcite .",
    "most abundances changes between the two studies of  a are minor . our result for o i makes use of three multiplet 12 lines and only one of the two previously analyzed lines .",
    "the scatter in the results from mg i line results is much less due to the use of multiplet 2 lines rather than those from multiplet 3 . for si ii , s ii , and ni ii to reduce the scatter we excluded those lines most likely to be blended . for ba",
    "ii , we used @xmath104934 instead of @xmath104554 as it less likely to be blended and had a smaller abundance .",
    "there are still some mild disagreements of results from elements with two or more atomic species , mg , ca , and fe . that the neutral species yield greater abundances than the first ionized species suggests that the stellar parameters still need a little more fine tuning .",
    "one way to achieve this is to increase the stellar gravity a little .",
    "it is difficult to draw in a continuum over the h@xmath11 line . for the h@xmath11 line profile to be within 0.5% of the continuum",
    ", predictions based on atlas9 models @xcite show that for the effective temperature and surface gravity of  a one needs to look about 60   from the line core to both shorter and longer wavelengths .",
    "hence it is difficult to place the stellar continuum in the vicinity of this strong balmer line in a - type main sequence stars .",
    "there may also be minor problems with the derived energy distribution .",
    "but until the astra spectrophotometer @xcite is operating , this possibility can not be checked properly .",
    "the lines from our new spectra helped reduce the standard deviations of the mean for many species .",
    "as @xcite use slightly greater resolution spectra than we have , do a proper analysis of the isotopic splitting for hg ii @xmath103984 , and use similar values of t@xmath25 and log g for @xmath3 her a , we adopted their result .",
    "it also brings the hg ii result into agreement with that from hg i @xmath104358 . for nd and",
    "pr we quote the values from dolk et al .",
    "( 2002 ) whose effective temperature for @xmath3 her a was 250 k greater than ours .",
    "the lines used were often weak .",
    "we found some additional nd iii lines in its spectrum .",
    "the abundance anomalies [ n / h ] = log n@xmath31 - log n@xmath32 for @xmath3 her a and for two sharp - lined hgmn stars @xmath33 her ( adelman et al .",
    "2006 ) and hr 7018 ( adelman et al . 2001 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ figanom ] @xmath33 her is a single star while hr 7018 is a single - lined spectroscopic binary .",
    "@xmath3 her a has many of the characteristics of other hgmn stars .",
    "the light elements in @xmath33 her are slightly sub - solar and are either solar or sub - solar in @xmath3 her a. scandium is very overabundant as are chromium , and manganese , while titanium is overabundant , vanadium has a solar abundance , iron is slightly overabundant , and nickel is underabundant . elements with atomic numbers greater than 28 are found to be overabundant when detected .",
    "optical interferometric observations made with the npoi conclusively detected the secondary star of the hgmn star .",
    "the npoi data enabled the prediction of a secondary spectral type of a8v .",
    "this prediction was confirmed via spectroscopic observations obtained at the dominion astrophysical observatory . until now lines of the secondary remained hidden in the generally much stronger lines of the primary .",
    "the secondary lines appear rotationally broadened to approximately 50 km s@xmath1 , consistent with the rotation rates for normal a stars .",
    "this result does put to rest the tentative , though interesting , suggestion by @xcite that the secondary of  could be a white dwarf . some changes to the abundances of  a are made and appear in table  [ compare ] . in table  [ stars ] we summarize the stellar parameters for the two components of .",
    "this combination of optical interferometry and spectroscopy enables an increase in the number of chemically peculiar stars in double - lined binary systems . a detailed knowledge of the secondary star is required to completely remove its effect on the chemical abundances observed in the companion hgmn star .",
    "lines most likely to be affected by blending with the secondary are identified and removed from consideration in the abundance analysis .",
