    "the solar spectrum observed close to the solar limb is linearly polarized .",
    "the polarization of the continuum , first observed by @xcite , is mainly produced by scattering at neutral hydrogen ( rayleigh scattering ) and free electrons ( thomson scattering ) .",
    "but spectral lines , linearly polarized by scattering processes , show incredibly rich and complex polarizations patterns ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "second solar spectrum _ ( @xcite ) has been the subject of many theoretical investigations because of its diagnostic potential for the magnetism ( and thermodynamics ) of the solar atmosphere ; but some polarization patterns are not yet well understood ( see @xcite for a review ) .    scattering line polarization",
    "is usually modeled independently of the continuum polarization .",
    "the continuum polarization is modeled as a coherent scattering process ( @xcite ) , which is a suitable approximation far from spectral lines .",
    "thomson and rayleigh scattering are coherent in the scatterer s frame ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the doppler broadening corresponding to the thermal velocity of electrons and hydrogen atoms is several times the width of most spectral lines , which may lead to redistribution between the polarization of the spectral line and the nearby continuum ( e.g. , @xcite , henceforth ll04 ) .",
    "the effect of non - coherent continuum scattering in radiative transfer was considered by @xcite , but his work did not include light polarization .",
    "he showed that the effect of the non - coherence on the intensity line spectrum is to broaden the profile and to make it shallower .",
    "the treatment of the rayleigh and thomson scattering was first extended to the non - coherent and polarized case by @xcite , who studied some of the effects that this phenomenon may have on the emergent spectral line radiation .",
    "these initial steps were later continued by other researchers ( e.g. , @xcite ) who studied the problem of non - coherent electron scattering and partial frequency redistribution on the polarization of resonance lines , pointing out the significance of electron scattering redistribution in the far wings of the line polarization profile . this result has been recently confirmed by @xcite after solving the same type of problem through the application of more efficient numerical radiative transfer methods .    in this paper",
    "we treat the radiation transfer problem of resonance line polarization taking into account its interaction with non - coherent scattering in the continuum .",
    "we treat the rayleigh and thomson redistribution as angle independent ( angle averaged redistribution ) , and the line emission and absorption using the two - level atom model with unpolarized lower level in the limit of complete frequency redistribution ( crd ) . to solve the relevant equations , formulated within the framework of the density matrix theory ( see ll04 ) ,",
    "we develop an efficient jacobian iterative method , which can be considered as a generalization of that proposed by @xcite for the crd line transfer case .",
    "we apply this numerical method to solve the radiation transfer problem in a milne - eddington atmosphere and in a stratified model atmosphere with a temperature minimum and a chromospheric temperature rise .",
    "we study the effects of the non - coherence of the continuum scattering on intrinsically unpolarizable ( transition between upper and lower levels with angular momentum @xmath0 ) and polarizable ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) lines .",
    "in particular , we show the possibility of generating  emission \" fractional linear polarization features ( i.e. , with larger polarization than in the adjacent continuum ) in the core of intrinsically unpolarizable spectral lines .",
    "we consider resonance line polarization ( assuming the crd and two - level atom model without stimulated emission ) in the presence of a polarized continuum in a plane - parallel , static and non - magnetic atmosphere . due to the symmetry of the problem ,",

    "[ figvarqi ] is that _ the non - coherent scattering in the continuum can be important and , under certain conditions , there can be an emission feature in the fractional linear polarization profile even when a total depolarization is expected .",

    "we used the two - level atom model with crd and angle - averaged non - coherent scattering in the continuum . to numerically solve this type of radiative transfer problem we developed a jacobian iterative method for the line and continuum source functions , which yields a fast convergence rate even in the case of very small line strengths .",

    "interestingly , @xmath202 polarization signals above the continuum level can be generated in the core of intrinsically unpolarizable @xmath213 lines ( i.e. , in spectral lines that were expected to simply depolarize the continuum polarization level ) .",
    "this result is of great potential interest for a better understanding of some enigmatic spectral lines of the second solar spectrum , which showed @xmath202 line - center signals above the continuum polarization level in spite of resulting from transitions between levels that were thought to be intrinsically unpolarizable ( see stenflo et al .",

    "in fact , our preliminary calculations for the ba ii d@xmath214 line ( neglecting the contribution of the 18% of barium that has hyperfine structure ) suggest that under certain stellar atmospheric conditions the physical mechanism discussed in this paper can produce significant @xmath202 emission features .    finally , we point out that the core of strong lines with intrinsic polarization are practically not affected by the non - coherent scattering",
