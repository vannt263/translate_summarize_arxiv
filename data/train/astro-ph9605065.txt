    "gravity initiates the formation of galaxies in the early universe , but shortly thereafter , explosions , winds , and ionizing radiation from massive stars and active galactic nuclei complicate the hydrodynamics of galaxy formation and regulate the transformation of gas into stars ( see recent reviews by bond 1993 and shapiro 1995 ) . in the nearby universe",
    "we see starbursting galaxies expelling up to @xmath13 of thermal and kinetic energy into intergalactic space over the lifetime of the burst ( see heckman , lehnert , & armus 1993 for a review )",
    ". the explosive output from a protogalaxy could be even larger , if most of its stars formed on the dynamical timescale of the galaxy .",
    "once the hot gas from a starburst escapes its host it flows into the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , shocking it , and eventually forming a blastwave similar to a supernova remnant .",
    "because cosmological effects , such as the expansion of the universe , eventually govern their behavior , the explosions that emanate from quasars or protogalaxies have sometimes been called cosmological blastwaves . as these shocks",
    "pass through intergalactic space , they compress the igm , sweeping it into denser sheets . such a picture has naturally motivated suggestions that cosmological blastwaves are somehow related to the intergalactic ly@xmath12 clouds whose absorption signatures striate the spectra of high - redshift quasars ( ozernoi & chernomordik 1978 ; ostriker & cowie 1981 ; chernomordik & ozernoi 1983 ; ikeuchi & ostriker 1986 ; vishniac & bust 1987 ) .",
    "early treatments of cosmological blastwaves posited a baryonic igm that dominated the matter content of the universe ( schwarz , ostriker , & yahil 1975 ; ostriker & cowie 1981 ; ikeuchi , tomisaka , & ostriker 1983 ; bertschinger 1983 ) . today",
    "the most successful cosmological models assume baryons comprise a relatively small fraction of the universe s matter content .",
    "since the older solutions do not apply , cosmological blastwaves and their impact on the igm deserve a fresh look from a more contemporary perspective .",
    "computational approaches to such `` feedback '' during galaxy formation , while rapidly growing more sophisticated , are still limited by numerical resolution ( e.g. cen & ostriker 1993 ; navarro & white 1993 ) . analytical approaches , like the one taken here , while simplistic and idealized , can be more flexible than numerical solutions and offer insights complementary to those gained from simulations . here",
    "we demonstrate that , in a universe filled primarily with collisionless matter , the structure and growth rate of a cosmological blastwave can be determined analytically .",
    "this new analytical solution turns out to be handy for reassessing the significance of protogalactic shocks in the igm .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  2 presents an analytical solution for adiabatic cosmological blastwaves , valid when the mass density of the igm is gravitationally unimportant .",
    "this solution is directly analogous to the sedov - taylor solution for adiabatic supernova remnants .",
    "as long as the shock remains adiabatic , the postshock density does not exceed four times the ambient intergalactic density until the shell of collisionless matter that collects at the shock front becomes self - gravitating .",
    "section  3 discusses how ionizing radiation modifies the medium into which intergalactic shocks propagate , and   4 considers the validity of the fluid approximation in the igm .",
    "section  5 explores the global impact of protogalactic shocks on the temperature and metallicity of the igm and derives constraints on the number density and energy scale of blastwave sources .",
    "section  6 examines possible relationships between intergalactic blastwaves and ly@xmath12 clouds , and   7 recapitulates the important results .",
    "intergalactic shocks can have an enormous impact on the igm .",
    "early calculations assuming that the ratio of the igm mass density to the total mass density of the universe ( @xmath14 ) was close to unity found that protogalactic blastwaves could fill the igm , heating and ionizing it by redshift @xmath7 of a few ( schwarz 1975 ) .",
    "subsequent treatments attempting to resolve cosmological shock structure in more detail ( ikeuchi 1983 ; bertschinger 1983 ; vishniac , ostriker , & bertschinger 1985 ) generally took @xmath15 and found that shocks in an igm dominated universe formed dense shells .",
    "ikeuchi ( 1983 ) assumed that dense shells would also form when @xmath16 . at late times",
    "this certainly happens .",
    "an explosion in the igm at a time @xmath17 since the big bang creates a cavity within which the mass density is a fraction @xmath18 lower than the background density . in a flat universe ( @xmath19 ) ,",
    "collisionless matter within the cavity gradually overtakes the shock front and forms a shell when the age of the universe is @xmath20 ( bertschinger 1985 ) . after this time",
    ", blastwave evolution asymptotically approaches the usual self - similar solutions in which @xmath17 can be neglected , and the shocked igm collapses into a dense layer just behind the shock front ( ikeuchi 1983 ; bertschinger 1983 ) . if @xmath16 , most of the interesting interactions of protogalactic shocks with the igm occur long before the blastwave reaches the asymptotic self - similar stage .",
    "this section presents an analytical solution for adiabatic cosmological blastwaves valid when @xmath16 and @xmath21 .",
    "taking advantage of some similarity properties of cosmological expansion ( see shandarin 1980 or shapiro , struck - marcell , & melott 1983 ) , one can transform the cosmological fluid equations into a form without an explicit hubble flow or background density .",
    "when the adiabatic index , @xmath22 , of the igm equals 5/3 , the transformed fluid equations admit a solution analogous to the sedov - taylor solution for adiabatic supernova remnants in a homogeneous medium .",
    "this solution turns out to be widely applicable , since cosmological shocks at @xmath23 tend to remain adiabatic .",
    "the solution breaks down when either cooling becomes important or perturbations in the collisionless background flow become large .",
    "self - similar solutions for cosmological blastwaves can be found straightforwardly when the age of the blastwave is much less than the current age of the universe or when the age of the blastwave is infinitesimally close to the current age of the universe ( see ostriker & mckee 1988 for a review ) . in these cases , there is only one important timescale .",
    "the intermediate case has been considered unfit for self - similar treatment because both the current age of the universe ( @xmath1 ) and the age of the blastwave ( @xmath0 ) are important . however , when @xmath24 a self - similar solution for cosmological blastwaves exists if @xmath25 and the blastwave is adiabatic .    to find this solution , we begin with the newtonian fluid equations , valid as long as the length scales are much smaller than the horizon of the universe and the velocities are non - relativistic : @xmath26 here , @xmath27 is the coordinate vector , @xmath28 is the corresponding velocity , @xmath29 is the gas pressure , @xmath30 is the specific internal energy , @xmath31 is the igm mass density , and @xmath32 is the mass density of collisionless ( non - baryonic plus condensed baryonic ) matter .",
    "the undisturbed igm comoves with the hubble flow .",
    "deviations from this flow can be expressed as a peculiar velocity field @xmath33 under the influence of a perturbed potential field @xmath34 . in terms of the scale factor @xmath35^{-1}$ ] , which obeys @xmath36 ,",
    "the mean mass density is @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the mass density of the universe at the present time ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "a transformation originally applied by shandarin ( 1980 ) recasts the cosmological fluid equations into a very useful form ( see also shapiro 1983 ) .",
    "the transformed variables are : @xmath40 @xmath41 these variables obey the equations @xmath42 the form of these equations closely follows that of the initial set except that @xmath43 and @xmath44 now represent comoving positions and peculiar velocities .    when @xmath16 , perturbations in the igm have little effect on the underlying gravitational potential .",
    "if we also assume that the underlying collisionless matter is distributed effectively homogeneously on the scale of the blastwave , terms containing @xmath45 can be ignored . in an adiabatic shock ,",
    "the heating and cooling terms are negligible . the only term remaining that depends on cosmic time",
    "is the second term in the energy equation , which vanishes if @xmath25 .",
    "this term accounts for the change in @xmath46 that arises when @xmath30 does not vary as @xmath47 . in a monatomic gas , all the internal energy is in translational degrees of freedom .",
    "these atomic motions can be viewed as peculiar velocities that redshift away like @xmath48 , so that @xmath49 in the absence of heating , cooling , and noncosmological work .",
    "energy contained in rotational and other internal degrees of freedom does not redshift away and adds to @xmath46 as the universe ages .",

    "the mach numbers of radiative shocks , with velocities @xmath349 (   2.2 ) , would still be too low to increase @xmath310 sufficiently .",
    "since blastwaves in a low - density igm have insignificant neutral columns , ly@xmath12 clouds form through some other means .",
    "the porosity and metallicity constraints discussed in   5 argue against pressure confinement of ly@xmath12 clouds .",
    "mechanisms in which interstellar gas collects in `` minihaloes '' of dark matter ( e.g. rees 1986 ) or converges at caustics in the large - scale velocity field ( e.g. mcgill 1990 , cen 1994 ) appear to be more likely .",
    "fluctuations in the spatial distribution of collisionless matter certainly alter the density field of the igm , which we have so far idealized as uniform .",
    "real intergalactic shocks propagate through an inhomogeneous medium ; hence , the solutions derived above become accurate only after the shock radius exceeds the length scales of non - linear density perturbations .",
    "the remainder of this section briefly examines how interactions between cosmological blastwaves and density inhomogeneities proceed and suggests that intergalactic blastwaves might amplify the neutral column densities of preexisting ly@xmath12 clouds .",
    "shock propagation into an inhomogeneous interstellar medium has been analyzed extensively ( mckee & cowie 1975 ; woodward 1976 ; nittman , falle , & gaskell 1982 ; stone & norman 1992 ; klein , mckee , & colella 1994 ) .",
    "when a shock of velocity @xmath77 encounters a cloud @xmath310 times denser than the ambient medium , it drives a shock of velocity @xmath350 into the cloud . in a cloud - crushing time ( @xmath351 ) , the internal shock crosses the cloud .",
    "detailed numerical simulations show that the vorticity generated in the cloud - shock collision shreds the cloud in a few cloud - crushing times ( nittman 1982 ; stone & norman 1992 ; klein 1994 ) .",
    "if ly@xmath12 clouds are indeed several hundred kpc in size , the cloud shredding time approaches a hubble time for @xmath77 less than a few times @xmath352 .",
    "since the postshock cooling time in the cloud is smaller than the ambient cooling time by a factor @xmath353 , such long - lived clouds , or fragments thereof , might collapse to much higher density before vorticity destroys the cloud .",
    "the resulting @xmath290 would then increase by a factor @xmath354 , where @xmath355 is the thermal velocity dispersion of the photoionized cloud after it has cooled to its equilibrium temperature .",
    "such a shock would impart a velocity @xmath350 to the cloud , perhaps carrying it out of its potential well .",
    "figure 11 illustrates how large @xmath310 must be for shocked clouds to cool within a hubble time . in the example shown",
    ", shocks of @xmath356 , @xmath357 , and @xmath242 begin propagating at @xmath358 in an @xmath19 , @xmath359 universe with @xmath93 .",
    "clouds with @xmath360 at @xmath361 , for instance , can cool after encountering shocks of @xmath362 .",
    "computing in detail how cosmological blastwaves interact with developing gaseous structures in the igm is beyond the scope of this paper ; however , the cooling times estimated here indicate that blastwaves could dramatically alter the observable characteristics of preexisting ly@xmath12 clouds .",
    "in essence , shocked clouds are pressure - confined , but the pressurizing medium does not pervade the universe .",
    "instead , the pressurized regions are the interiors of individual blastwaves",
    ". clouds near blastwave sources would then have systematically higher neutral column densities than clouds in the ambient igm .",
    "this paper has investigated the behavior of protogalactic and quasar - driven blastwaves in an expanding universe with @xmath131 .",
    "it presents a new analytical solution for adiabatic blastwaves that applies until @xmath363 , when self - gravity starts to compress the postshock gas into a thin shell .",
    "although two different timescales ( @xmath1 and @xmath17 ) enter into the problem , a self - similar solution still exists .",
    "the similarity of the universe s expansion allows us to define another time coordinate ( @xmath64 ) in which the sedov - taylor solution satisfies an appropriately transformed set of fluid equations if @xmath25 .",
    "cosmological blastwaves thus begin as sedov - taylor blastwaves and approach a constant comoving radius as @xmath1 grows large . while @xmath137 , the gas density immediately behind the shock remains equal to four times the ambient density ,",
    "so cosmological shocks do not cool until they are moving quite slowly .    applying this solution to protogalactic starbursts and",
    "quasars shows that small - scale explosions ( @xmath364 ) are probably more important than large - scale explosions ( @xmath365 ) in determining the state of the igm and its ly@xmath12 clouds .",
    "large - scale explosions are quite inefficient at ionizing the igm .",
    "cosmological effects rob most of the energy from large - scale blastwaves before these shocks slow to speeds that ionize efficiently ( @xmath366 ) . in addition , since the comoving volume per unit energy of a blastwave is @xmath367 , small - scale explosions can fill the igm much more easily .",
    "quasar - driven blastwaves are too rare to fill the igm by @xmath9 without violating the @xmath234-parameter limit from cobe .",
    "large - scale protogalactic blastwaves that filled the universe by such an early time would raise the mean metallicity of the igm well above the values observed in ly@xmath12 clouds at @xmath368 .",
    "contrary to some suggestions that ly@xmath12 clouds might be shells of gas shocked by cosmological blastwaves , the solution derived here shows that the postshock gas never becomes dense enough to produce @xmath369 when @xmath370 . even if the blastwave has slowed enough to cool , the compression of the ambient igm is still too small to raise @xmath290 to the levels observed in ly@xmath12 clouds .",
    "blasts that pass through overdense regions of the igm , such as preexisting ly@xmath12 clouds , might still produce observable signatures .",
    "compression and cooling can dramatically amplify the neutral fraction in a shocked cloud , so clouds engulfed by blastwaves could have systematically higher values of @xmath290 .",
    "this effect would increase the probability of finding clouds near blastwave sources .    during the development of this paper , conversations with steve balbus , megan donahue , mike fall , piero madau , and sterl phinney were particularly helpful .",
