    "nowadays , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is established as the fundamental theory of the strong interaction , and perturbative qcd gives a standard framework to describe high - energy reactions of hadrons .",

    ", however , qcd exhibits a strong - coupling nature and the resulting nonperturbative qcd is a very difficult and complicated theory .    as for the gauge fixing , the landau and the coulomb gauges have been often used as the typical gauge in qcd , but their physical pictures seem to be rather different for several important arguments in qcd .    as the typical example",
    ", the color confinement , which is an important gauge - invariant qcd phenomenon , can be explained from various viewpoints in various gauges . in the landau gauge",
    ", the color confinement is mathematically investigated by the kugo - ojima criterion , in terms of the brst charge and the inverse higgs theorem @xcite . in the coulomb gauge ,",
    "the color confinement is argued from the viewpoint of a large instantaneous coulomb energy @xcite , and its resulting gluon - chain picture @xcite . taking the maximally abelian ( ma ) gauge , the quark confinement has been discussed in terms of the dual superconductor picture @xcite .",
    "of course , in gauge theories , the physical quantities never depend on the gauge choice . however , according to the gauge choice , the physical picture can be changed , and the role of the gauge field , which is fundamental field of the gauge theory , can be also changed .",
    "then , it is important to link the different gauges , and investigate the role of gluons in each gauge .",
    "in fact , the role and the properties of gluons are expected to be clarified by the overview on the structure of gauge dependence .",
    "for example , it is meaningful to investigate the continuous connection between the landau and the coulomb gauges , using the generalized landau gauge @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "aiming to grasp the gluon properties through a continuous view from the landau gauge to the coulomb gauge , we investigate `` generalized landau gauge '' ( or `` @xmath3-gauge '' ) , and apply it to interesting gluonic correlations , such as instantaneous interquark potentials both for q@xmath4 and 3q systems , in su(3 ) lattice qcd at @xmath5=5.8 @xcite . here , the generalized landau gauge is a natural general gauge to connect the landau , the coulomb , and the temporal gauges , by one real parameter @xmath3 . in this interpolating gauge , we quantitatively clarify how rapidly the expectation values of several operators transition from their coulomb gauge values to the landau gauge results .",

    "in this section , we briefly review the properties of the landau gauge and the coulomb gauge .",
    "the landau gauge is one of the most popular gauges in qcd , and its gauge fixing is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 are gluon fields , with @xmath8 generator @xmath9 .",
    "the landau gauge keeps the lorentz covariance and the global su(@xmath10 ) color symmetry .",
    "these symmetries simplify the tensor structure of various quantities in qcd .",
    "for example , the gluon propagator @xmath11 is simply expressed as @xmath12 due to the symmetries and the transverse property .",
    "owing to this advanced feature , the landau gauge is often used both in the schwinger - dyson formalism @xcite and in lattice qcd studies for quarks and gluons @xcite .",
    "in euclidean qcd , the landau gauge has a global definition to minimize the global quantity , @xmath13 by the gauge transformation .",
    "this global definition is more strict , and the local form in eq.([eqlandaufix ] ) can be obtained from the minimization of @xmath14 .",
    "since the quantity @xmath14 physically means the total amount of gauge - field fluctuations , and therefore the landau gauge maximally suppresses artificial gauge - field fluctuations originated from the gauge degrees of freedom .    here , we comment on non - locality of the gauge fields . through the gauge fixing procedure",
    ", gauge fields have non - locality stemming from the faddeev - popov determinant .",
    "in the landau gauge , this non - locality of gauge fields is lorentz covariant .    using the landau gauge , or a covariant and globally symmetric gauge",
    ", the color confinement has been mathematically investigated in terms of the brst charge and the inverse higgs theorem , which is known as the `` kugo - ojima criterion '' @xcite .",
    "the coulomb gauge is also a popular gauge in qcd , and its gauge fixing is given by @xmath15 this condition resembles the landau gauge condition of eq.([eqlandaufix ] ) , but there are no constraints on @xmath16 . in the coulomb gauge ,",
    "the lorentz covariance is partially broken , and gauge field components are completely decoupled into two parts , @xmath17 and @xmath16 : @xmath17 behave as canonical variables and @xmath16 becomes an instantaneous potential .",
    "similarly in the landau gauge , the coulomb gauge has a global definition to minimize the global quantity @xmath18 by the gauge transformation .",
    "note here that the euclidean metric is not necessary for the global definition of the coulomb gauge .",
    "note also that there appears no nonlocality in the temporal direction in the coulomb gauge . due to this feature",
    ", a hadron mass measurement can be safely performed using a spatially - extended quark source in the coulomb gauge in lattice qcd calculations @xcite .    in the coulomb gauge ,",
    "one of the advantages is the compatibility with the canonical quantization @xcite .",
    "the qcd hamiltonian is expressed as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the color charge density , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the color electric and magnetic field , respectively . here",

    "is expected to be largely enhanced and leads to a confining interquark potential , which is called as the `` gribov - zwanziger scenario '' @xcite .",
    "as zwanziger showed , the coulomb energy ( instantaneous potential ) @xmath27 in the coulomb gauge gives an upper bound on the static interquark potential @xmath28 @xcite , i.e. , @xmath29 this inequality indicates that if the physical interquark potential is confining then the coulomb energy @xmath30 is also confining .",
    "actually , lattice qcd calculations @xcite show that the coulomb energy ( the instantaneous potential ) between a quark and an antiquark leads to a linear potential , which characterizes the confinement .",
    "however , the slope of the instantaneous potential is too large , i.e. , @xmath31 times larger than the physical string tension , and this coulomb system turns out to be an excited state .    as for the ground - state of the quark - antiquark system ,",
    "thorn and greensite proposed the `` gluon - chain picture '' in the coulomb gauge @xcite .",
    "in fact , to screen the large coulomb energy between the quark and the antiquark , chain - like gluons are dynamically generated between them .",
    "this gluon - chain is expected to give the linear potential between quarks . in other words ,",
    "qcd string can be regarded as a `` chain '' of gluons in the coulomb gauge .",
    "in this section , we investigate the `` generalized landau gauge '' , or `` @xmath3-gauge '' , which continuously connects the landau and the coulomb gauges @xcite .",
    "since the landau gauge and the coulomb gauge are useful gauges and give different interesting pictures in qcd , it is meaningful to show the linkage of these gauges . to link these gauges ,",
    "we generalize the gauge fixing condition ( [ eqlandaufix ] ) as @xmath32 by introducing one real parameter @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the case of @xmath33 corresponds to the landau gauge fixing condition , the coulomb gauge is achieved at @xmath34 , and the temporal gauge is also realized for @xmath35 .",
