    "secondary ion mass spectrometry , sims , is a well - established analytical method in surface , materials and chemical sciences . besides conducting routine elemental , molecular , and isotopic analyses of solid surfaces and thin films , creative applications of this method help in finding solutions to a variety of non - standard materials science problems @xcite .",
    "sputter depth profiling analysis provides information on the variation of sample composition with depth below the initial surface .",
    "in such applications , the sims method is in a class of its own due to the unique combination of high sensitivity and depth resolution . while for other surface sensitive analytical techniques , such as auger electron or x - ray photoelectron spectroscopies ( aes or xps ) , the inherent escape depth is @xmath61 nm , for sims this characteristic parameter on the order of 1 to 2 atomic layers , which can be considered as a theoretical limit of its depth resolution @xcite . in real life , however , the depth resolution of sims is limited by an native surface roughness of the sample ( if any ) and by the fundamental effect called ion beam mixing @xcite . mixing is characterized by the ion beam mixing length @xmath7 , which is a figure - of - merit of a sims instrument . for all depth profiling analyses , the former limiting factor is out of the analyst s control .",
    "fortunately , one can minimize the latter effect by optimizing analytical approaches .",
    "often , new combinations of techniques for sample material erosion and composition probing are sought after . as an alternative to sputtering",
    ", sample material can be removed for compositional probing by laser enhanced field desorption @xcite , as implemented in modern atom probe tomography instruments . in the case of sims depth profiling analysis , all such approaches , in general , aim at decreasing the energy deposited into the sample by incident projectiles .",
    "this can be achieved by either directly decreasing the ion beam energy , as usually done for conventional primary ions ( cs@xmath1 , noble gas ions , and o@xmath8 as well ) @xcite , or implicitly , by having more constituent atoms in the primary molecular / cluster ions ( single charged sf@xmath9 @xcite , c@xmath10 @xcite molecules / au and bi @xcite , or ar @xcite clusters ) and dividing this energy between the constituents so that each atom has much lower impact energy ( @xmath01/60 of the nominal beam energy per single constituent atom in the case of c@xmath10 ) .",
    "the dual - beam ( db ) depth profiling @xcite was introduced in time of flight ( tof ) sims instruments to decouple the depth resolution of the direct current ( dc ) sputtering ion beam from the lateral resolution of the pulsed analysis ion beam . in the db approach ,",
    "the sputtering and analysis cycles are independent , and the depth resolution is controlled only by the sputtering beam parameters @xcite . in order to fully realize the potential of the db sputter depth profiling approach , we further improved it by implementing a normally incident sputtering ion beam , which is extracted from the ion source at nominal energy of a few kev and delivered with the same energy into the target region , where the target potential can decelerate it so that the impact energy does not exceed a few hundred ev @xcite .",
    "this permits direct adjustment of the sputtering beam energy ( down to the sputtering threshold ) without losses of the ion beam current and degradation of the beam spot quality .",
    "an important benefit of the normal incidence sputtering is the significant reduction in roughening of the surface induced by the ion beam @xcite .",
    "moreover , the lower the impact energy , the lower the ion mixing effects are .",
    "thus , the low energy normally incident sputtering ion beam maximizes the benefits of the db sputter depth profiling and allows us to create a versatile instrument , suitable both for ultra - trace surface analysis @xcite and applications in the materials science applications , and thus address a current problem on successful mass application of nanodevices discussed in ref.@xcite . to resolve this problem , development of advanced and powerful characterization tools , combining multiple points of view ( i.e. probes ) on a sample , is highly needed to achieve _",
    "faster , facile and standardized characterization _ and",
    "so to _ reap the benefits of nanotechnology _ @xcite .",
    "we apply here _ _",
    "gentle__db approach to better understand chemistry and structure of ultrathin films produced by atomic layer deposition ( ald ) .",
    "the ald technique is widely used for a layer - by - layer materials synthesis and has great application potential in many areas due to its ability to coat high - aspect - ratio substrates by conformal layered structures with precisely predefined compositional profiles @xcite .",
    "one of such important application areas is functionalization of material surfaces for use in novel detectors and sensors .",
    "our effort here is the contribution to the large area picosecond photo - detector ( http://psec.uchicago.edu/ ) collaboration , which is focused on fast particle detectors with large areas functionalized by ald .",
    "it is known that thin films of metal oxides can serve as very efficient emitters of secondary electrons and be used for improving detector performance .",
    "moreover , it has been recently shown that such ald - grown films of several nm thickness enable independent tailoring of the electrical resistance and the secondary electron emission yield @xcite .",
    "a functionalization of a detector based on a large area ( tens square centimeters ) microchannel plate means that surfaces of the vast amount of microchannel plate pores must be coated by thin films with predefined characteristics .",
    "this task is the perfect match to the unique capabilities of ald . at the same time , understanding and",
    "controlling the coating uniformity ( thickness fluctuation etc . ) and the condition of interfaces between resistive and emitting layers as well as between those and the substrate are extremely important for improving the materials performance and functionality .    with this goal in mind ,",
    "we characterize in this work a stack of 16 alternating @xmath05.5 nm mgo and zno layers ( 8 of each ) using _ _",
    "gentle__db sims depth profiling approach with normally incident 250 ev and 500 ev ar@xmath1 ion beams for sputtering and a pulsed 5 kev ar@xmath1 beam ( pointed at 60@xmath2 from the target normal ) for analysis .",
    "the chosen stack of 8 pairs mgo / zno , being one of the proposed functionalization systems , serves two purposes .",
    "the first one is to create a planar ( unfolded ) model of an actual microchannel plate pore surface coating with complex geometry coating in order to reveal the layer - to - layer reproducibility of the ald process starting from the substrate , along with the layers uniformity and the conditions of interlayer interfaces .",
    "the other purpose is to test the depth profiling capabilities of the _ _",
    "gentle__db approach .",
    "besides , multilayer nanostructures and devices are at the forefront of materials science .",
    "giant magnetoresistance multilayer films @xcite or superlattices of transition metal oxides @xcite are striking examples of this . desired performance of such structures",
    "strongly depends on the interfacial roughness , interdiffusion between layers , layer - to - layer consistency , and layer conformality as well .",
    "thus , we aim to demonstrate in this work the unique synergy of the combination of the low energy sputtering with inert gas ions and the normal incidence angle , which makes the _ _ gentle__db depth profiling approach superior to many others , especially when applied to characterization of nanolayers . in this case",
    ", the capability of sputter depth profiling without alteration of the sample chemical composition and modification of its surface and interface morphology does minimize instrumental artifacts and experimental / procedural assumptions and thus helps to elucidate the relationship between these parameters and advance materials synthesis approaches .",
    "we will support these statements by demonstrating accurate depth profiling on the nanometer scale and determining key characterization parameters such as the ion beam mixing length , and the decay @xmath11 and leading @xmath12 lengths , which effectively characterize the resolution of an instrument and can be compared with those of other approaches / setups in the field .",
    "the proposed characterization approach becomes even more important if one imagines that less - than - nm depth resolution is achieved laterally over the area of @xmath01 mm@xmath13 ( in general , this area can be varied between @xmath0100@xmath14100 @xmath15m@xmath13 to several mm@xmath13 ) .",
    "a layered structure @xmath165.5 nm mgo/5.5 nm zno@xmath16@xmath148 was grown by the ald technique on a si substrate and characterized by x - ray diffraction and ellipsometry .",
    "the standard calibration and characterization procedures of ald can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "the structural data obtained from these measurements indicated that mgo layers are amorphous and zno layers are polycrystalline in the wurtzite phase . although the surface roughness of the mgo / zno sample was not measured , al@xmath17o@xmath18/zno multilayers prepared under similar conditions had a surface roughness of 0.9 - 1.5 nm @xcite .",
    "the roughness of the si substrate was @xmath00.3 nm . the initial layer - to - layer mixing due to thermal diffusion during growth at @xmath19=473 k is expected to be extremely low .",
    "the depth profiling of the layered structure described above was performed using a custom made sarisa ( surface analysis by resonance ionization of sputtered atoms ) instrument operated in sims mode ( instead of its primary mode of secondary neutral mass spectrometry with laser post - ionization ) @xcite .",
    "the sarisa tof mass spectrometer was designed to operate in multiple modes using the same set of ion optics @xcite . with",
    "post - ionization lasers switched off , the instrument operation corresponds to that of tof sims with long primary ion pulses ( @xmath00.2 - 1 @xmath15s ) and delayed extraction of secondary ions . for the experiments described below , sarisa s ion optics either delivered the primary sputtering ar@xmath1 ion beam to the sample assuring its orthogonal impact onto sample surface and controlling its impact energy , or it extracted secondary ions generated by a pulsed analytical ar@xmath1 ion beam and performed their tof ms analysis @xcite .",
    "fast switching between these regimes was done electronically by changing the potentials of the optics electrodes .",
    "the low energy ion beam is formed by injecting a kev ion beam produced by a vg ex05 gun into the tof spectrometer ion optics , by delivering and focusing the beam at normal incidence to the sample and by decelerating the ions to the desired low impact energy by biasing the target with an appropriate voltage ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the beam defocusing , which accompanies this deceleration , is compensated by changing the voltage of the outlet electrostatic lens called lens1 @xcite .",
    "the impact energy of this milling beam was set in this study to either 250 or 500 ev , and the ion current was @xmath01 @xmath15a .",
    "this beam was raster scanned over the sample surface by engaging an octupole deflector present in the tof system ion path ( the shaping octupole in fig .",
    "1 ) , so that a square crater of @xmath01.5@xmath141.5 mm@xmath13 ( shown in fig.1 as a blue square ) was eroded .",
    "the exact size of the crater depends on the deceleration potential of the target , which additionally deflects the beam when it is raster scanned .",
    "for example , the ratio of the crater sides between @xmath20=250 ev and @xmath20=3 kev equals 1.3 ; this value was proved both by crater imaging and by simion 3d@xmath21 @xcite simulation .",
    "the analytical ion beam , used to probe the sample at various depths , comes from an atomika wf421 gun pointed at 60@xmath2 incidence with respect to the target normal ( fig.1 ) .",
    "this ion beam can be independently tuned , raster scanned , and pulsed .",
    "the primary ar@xmath1 ion energy was always 5 kev , and the pulse duration used in the analysis in all the experiments was 200 ns , since mass resolution under these conditions was sufficient .",
    "the raster scan size of this ion beam in all the experiments described here was set to a 500@xmath14500 @xmath15m@xmath13 ( the green square in fig.1 ) . during the tof ms analysis cycle , the deceleration potential on the target",

    "_ gentle__db depth profiling obtained on a sample of exceedingly disturbed grown interfaces suggest that the native roughness is not the dominant factor in the degradation and smearing of depth profiles in sims .",
    "to prove this , we applied the conventional single beam tof sims depth profiling approach to the same sample , using 5 kev ar@xmath1 ions with 60@xmath2 incidence angle ( generated by the atomika wf421 ion gun )  for both ion milling and tof ms analysis ( results to be published ) .",

    "moreover , we observed with single beam approach the periodical sine signal with exponential attenuation mentioned above as well as the smearing of the peak shapes for deeper layers .",
    "to summarize , the ion beam mixing appears to be the most important phenomenon to account for in depth profiling experiments on nanolayered structures .",

    "to conclude , we have outlined here our approach to solve the nanomaterial characterization bottleneck problem @xcite in the materials science by application of tof sims technique .",
    "namely , we described our gentle variant of the dual - beam sputter depth profiling ( _ _ gentle__db ) applied to characterization of nanolayered materials and demonstrated sub - nanometer depth resolution of the method .",
