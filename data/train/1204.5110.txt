    "<S> this is due to the tilt of the droplet interface : the droplet radius changes significantly within the optical section of the 2d confocal image ( @xmath22  @xmath1 m ) , so the edge of the droplet is blurred in these cases and can not be clearly determined with our image analysis , and these droplets are not tracked . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , for each droplet we track , the droplet radius @xmath23 we apparently observe is in the range @xmath24 .    </S>",
    "<S> when an oscillatory strain is applied to the emulsion , the majority of droplets rearrange reversibly and periodically at the driving frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the droplet - averaged displacement field is @xmath25 ( with no motion on average in @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is this average motion we term the `` affine motion '' in the sense that the position predicted by @xmath28 is an affine transformation of the original positions . </S>",
    "<S> ( this differs from some prior work where affine motion was determined locally in space and time @xcite . ) in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ droplets ] . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , smaller droplets move in a variety of directions .    </S>",
    "<S> this variety of displacements for the smaller droplets is due to the largest droplets . at the equator of a large droplet , it moves with the expected motion for that height @xmath27 , that is , @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the droplets deform little and thus move as fairly rigid spheres , and thus the top of a large droplet moves with an amplitude @xmath31 too small relative to the expected velocity at height @xmath32 . likewise , at height @xmath33 the large droplet moves faster than the mean velocity for that height . </S>",
    "<S> two large droplets that are nearby but with centers at different @xmath27 do not have the same velocities , and as they move back and forth sinusoidally , they push and pull on the smaller droplets between them . these smaller droplets thus have apparently random motions . in practice , </S>",
    "<S> the larger droplets are rarer and so less likely to influence each other . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , they move based on the average influence of the smaller droplets surrounding them , and so their motion tends to follow the average motion @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the contrast in motion between large and small droplets in a highly polydisperse sample differs qualitatively from cases where large - scale flows cause non - affine motion , and which typically require large amplitude strain @xcite .    over the 33  s movies , approximately 8% of the droplets make an irreversible rearrangement at some point </S>",
    "<S> this only occurs with smaller droplets , @xmath34  @xmath1 m . </S>",
    "<S> before and after the irreversible rearrangement , the droplets move periodically . </S>",
    "<S> the rarity of plastic rearrangements in our data is similar to a prior study of a more monodisperse emulsion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our typical forcing amplitude for the shear cell ( @xmath9  @xmath1 m ) was chosen to limit the amount of plastic rearrangements .    at this point </S>",
    "<S> we only study droplets whose trajectories are reversible ( elastic ) and thus periodic . </S>",
