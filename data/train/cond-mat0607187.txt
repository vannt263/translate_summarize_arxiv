    "the problem of a theoretical description of metal - insulator transitions has a challenging history of almost 70 years .",
    "it was first addressed by verwey , de boer , and peierls in the late 1930 s ; they pointed out the extremely important role of electron - electron correlations in a partially filled @xmath13-electron band in transition metal oxides,@xcite e.g. , nickel oxide ( nio ) and magnetite ( fe@xmath0o@xmath1 ) . in both systems",
    "the metal - insulator transition occurs , violating the bloch - wilson band - insulator concept , the only one known at that time.@xcite these earlier observations launched the long and continuing history of the field of strongly correlated electrons . in the past 70 years , much progress has been achieved from both theoretical and experimental sides in understanding strongly correlated electrons and metal - insulator transitions.@xcite however , the charge ordering proposed by verwey behind the metal - insulator transition @xcite in fe@xmath0o@xmath1 remains at the focus of active debate.@xcite    magnetite is a permanent natural magnet .",
    "its magnetic properties have fascinated mankind for several thousand years already.@xcite comprehensive investigation of magnetite started in 1913 when the first indication of the first - order transition was obtained by a susceptibility measurement on a synthetic polycrystal.@xcite an anomalous transition peak at @xmath10130 k was found in addition to the already known paramagnetic - to - ferrimagnetic order transition on cooling through @xmath10850 k. electric resistivity measurements initially performed by okamura@xcite and verwey@xcite showed that this anomalous behavior of the susceptibility coincides with a sharp two orders of magnitude increase of resistivity on cooling below @xmath10120 k.@xcite the formal valency of fe@xmath8 cations on the octahedral @xmath14 sublattice of the inverted spinel ab@xmath15o@xmath1 structure is noninteger ( 2.5 + ) .",
    "verwey suggested that this transition is caused by the ordering of fe@xmath8 cations , with a simple charge arrangement of @xmath16 planes alternately occupied by @xmath6 and @xmath7 fe@xmath8 cations.@xcite this particular ( verwey ) charge order ( co ) obeys the so - called anderson criterion@xcite of minimal electrostatic repulsion leading to a short range co pattern with each tetrahedron formed by @xmath14 sites being occupied by equal numbers of 2 + and 3 + cations .",
    "however , further experiments disproved the orthorhombic verwey co model .",
    "these experiments have clearly established the rhombohedral distortions of the cubic unit cell first detected by rooksby @xmath17 from x - ray powder diffraction.@xcite furthermore , observations of superstructure reflections revealed half - integer satellite reflections , indexed as @xmath18 on the cubic unit cell , which points to a doubling of the unit cell along the @xmath19 axis and shows the symmetry to be monoclinic.@xcite the observation of monoclinic lattice symmetry was also confirmed by a single - crystal x - ray study,@xcite whereas the observation of a magnetoelectric effect indicated even lower @xmath20 symmetry in the low - temperature phase.@xcite although , clear evidence of the monoclinic lattice symmetry below @xmath21 was obtained , small atomic displacements have not been fully resolved so far .",
    "the absence of a definitive , experimentally determined structure gives rise to many theoretical models proposed for the low - temperature ( lt ) phase of magnetite.@xcite in particular , purely electronic @xcite and electron - phonon @xcite models for co , as well as a bond dimerized ground state without charge separation,@xcite have been proposed",
    ".    at room temperature fe@xmath0o@xmath1 is a poor metal with an electronic resistivity of 4 m@xmath22 cm which is considerably higher than the resistivity of simple metals ( for instance , the resistivity of cu is 1.7 @xmath23 cm ) .",
    "the microscopic origin of the electronic state above the verwey transition is still unclear .",
    "photoemission studies performed by chainani _",
    "et al._@xcite and park _",
    "et al._@xcite gave controversial results indicating metallic and semiconducting behavior above @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "in accordance with park _ et al._,@xcite qualitatively similar conclusions have been derived by schrupp _",
    "et al._@xcite and pimenov _",
    "et al._@xcite basing on a soft x - ray photoemission study and complex conductivity measurements at terahertz / infrared frequencies , respectively .",
    "magnetite is a ferrimagnet with anomalous high curie temperature of @xmath10850 k. the @xmath24-site magnetic moments are aligned antiparallel to the @xmath14-site moments .",
    "this remarkable situation of antiferromagnetic coupling between fe@xmath25 and fe@xmath26 cations , which have @xmath27 and @xmath28 electron configurations in the high - spin state , respectively , should lead to a half - metallic state with integer magnetic moment of 4@xmath29 per formula unit .",
    "this is in qualitatively good agreement with magnetization measurements , which result in a @xmath104.1@xmath29 magnetic moment per unit cell.@xcite in contrast , spin resolved photoemission measurements show @xmath1020% suppression of the pure negative spin polarization from the half - metallic behavior obtained for fe@xmath0o@xmath1 ( 111 ) films.@xcite scanning tunneling microscopy and spin - polarized photoelectron spectroscopy give only 55% of negative spin polarization at the fermi level.@xcite to explain this phenomenon two possible scenarios have been recently proposed .",
    "according to the first , fe@xmath0o@xmath1 is still a half metal in the bulk , whereas surface stresses lead to unusual lattice distortions which reduce spin polarization at the fermi level to @xmath1040%.@xcite an alternative explanation is the formation of nonquasiparticle or incoherent states in the gap near the fermi level due to correlation effects.@xcite    recent bond - valence - sum analysis @xcite of high - resolution neutron and x - ray powder diffraction data results in a small charge disproportion of only 0.2@xmath30 between fe@xmath8 cations with the 2 + and 3 + formal valency.@xcite this interpretation has been the subject of much controversy.@xcite however , the smallness of the charge order parameter was reproduced in an electronic structure study of the refined low - temperature crystal structure using the loacl spin density approximation ( lsda)+@xmath2 method.@xcite in particular , a more complicated charge - ordering pattern inconsistent with the verwey co model was obtained .",
    "in addition to that , the @xmath5 occupancy self - consistently obtained in the lsda+@xmath2 calculations is strongly modulated between the fe@xmath31 and fe@xmath32 cations , yielding a distinct orbital order with an order parameter that reaches 70% of the ideal value.@xcite since no direct experimental confirmation of this charge and orbital order pattern is so far available , the interpretation of these results is still open to debate .",
    "however , this behavior seems to be universal and has recently been found in several other charge ordered mixed - valent systems.@xcite    in order to further check the pertinence of the co model obtained self - consistently in ref .",
    "we carried out a detailed theoretical study of exchange coupling constants , optical conductivity , magneto - optical ( mo ) kerr effect , and x - ray absorption at the o @xmath12 edge of low - temperature fe@xmath0o@xmath1 and compared the results of the calculations to the available experimental data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : struc ] we discuss the low temperature crystal structure of fe@xmath0o@xmath1 . section [ sec : compd ] presents computational details relevant to reproduce the calculation results . the results of electronic structure calculations obtained by the lsda and lsda+@xmath2 methods for the low - temperature fe@xmath0o@xmath1 are presented in secs .",
    "[ sec : lsda ] and [ sec : lsdau ] , respectively . in section",
    "[ sec : lsdau ] a charge and orbital order are also discussed and results of calculations of exchange coupling constants are presented . in section [ sec : optics ] we present calculated optical , magneto - optical , and o @xmath12-edge x - ray absorption spectra and compare them to corresponding experimental spectra .",
    "finally , the results are summarized in section [ sec : sum ] .",
    "above the verwey transition magnetite crystallizes in the face - centered cubic ( fcc ) inverse spinel crystal structure with space group @xmath33 .",
    "the iron atoms occupy the interstitial positions of the close - packed fcc structure formed by the oxygen atoms . according to the chemical formula of inverse spinel , @xmath34o@xmath1 , there are two different iron sublattices ( @xmath24 and @xmath14 ) distinguished by the point symmetry ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) as well as by the averaged fe  o distance ( 1.876 and 2.066   for @xmath24 and @xmath14 iron sites , respectively ) and the valence state of iron cations . in particular , the @xmath24 sublattice is formed by fe@xmath37 cations tetrahedrally coordinated by four oxygen ions , whereas the so - called @xmath14 sublattice consists of iron sites octahedrally coordinated by six oxygen ions .",
    "the octahedral @xmath14-sites are occupied by an equal number of randomly distributed 2 + and 3 + fe cations , which results in an average valence value of 2.5 + per each fe@xmath8 cation .",
    "the @xmath14-sublattice is highly frustrated and can be considered as a diamond lattice of fe@xmath8 cation tetrahedra , sharing corners with each other .",
    "one of the driving forces for formation of the charge - ordered state in mixed valent transition metal oxides is coulomb repulsion .",
    "in particular , another key to understanding the charge - ordered structure in fe@xmath0o@xmath1 is provided by the anderson criterion for the minimum of electrostatic repulsion energy.@xcite according to anderson each tetrahedron formed by octahedral @xmath14 sites of the spinel structure is occupied by two 2 + and two 3 + fe cations in order to minimize the intersite electrostatic repulsion .",
    "thus , within the @xmath38 supercell of the cubic fe@xmath0o@xmath1 , there are ten independent cationic arrangements , whereas one of them coincides with the verwey model.@xcite however , the verwey co pattern has overall the lowest classical electron correlation energy .",
    "the low - temperature structure was shown to have a @xmath39 supercell with space group @xmath38 from x - ray and neutron diffraction.@xcite however , recent structural refinement ( at 90 k ) was only possible in the centric monoclinic space group @xmath40 with @xmath41 of the cubic spinel subcell and eight formula units in the primitive unit cell.@xcite since the refinement for the @xmath40 space group was found to be unstable , additional @xmath42 orthorhombic symmetry constraints were also applied .",
    "this is equivalent to averaging the true superstructure over the additional symmetry operators , i.e. , each @xmath14 site in the @xmath40 unit cell is averaged over four nonequivalent subsites in the large @xmath43  @xmath38 supercell .",
    "note , however , that such an approximation is robust in the sense of smallness of any distortions from the @xmath40 subcell to the @xmath38 monoclinic cell ( according to ref .",
    "these are of @xmath100.01  ) .",
    "previous structure refinement below @xmath21 obtained by iizumi _",
    "et al . _ resulted in a @xmath41 subcell of the @xmath38 unit cell and imposed orthorhombic symmetry constraints on the atomic positions.@xcite in particular , a refinement based on an approximation of the true crystal structure by a centric space group @xmath42 or polar @xmath44 was proposed . but",
    "a charge - ordered arrangement has not been identified in this refinement , although large atomic displacements of fe and o atoms were found .",
    "this is in strong qualitative contrast to the recent structure refinement proposed by wright _",
    "_ where clear evidence of co below the transition has been found.@xcite    according to the refinement the octahedral fe@xmath8 sites are split into two groups with different values of the averaged fe ",
    "o bond distances ; with @xmath45 and @xmath46 sites being significantly smaller than @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( @xmath47-@xmath48 are crystallographically independent fe@xmath8 sites according to the notation in refs .   and ) . a different averaged",
    "fe  o bond distance is a sensitive experimental indicator of the cation charge state",
    ". quantitative analysis of the valence state of both fe@xmath8 groups using the bond - valence - sum ( bvs ) method shows that the octahedral fe@xmath8 sites fall into two clear groups with respect to the estimated value of valence .",
    "the result is a charge disproportion of 0.2@xmath30 between large ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) and small ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) sites ( which has been referred as the class i co model ) .",
    "another possible class of co arises from the symmetry - averaging orthorhombic constraint .",
    "there are 32 charge - ordered models which are refered to as class ii co because large ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) and small ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) sites could be averaged over ( 3 fe@xmath49 + fe@xmath37 ) and ( fe@xmath49 + 3 fe@xmath49 ) subsites , respectively .",
    "the symmetry averaging results in decrease of the more pronounced charge separation of 0.4@xmath30 in the full @xmath38 superstructure ( class ii co ) down to 0.2@xmath30 in the @xmath40 subcell .",
    "the anderson criterion is not satisfied by any of the class i or class ii co models .",
    "this is remarkable because the anderson criterion has been widely used in many co models.@xcite however , class ii , as was shown from electrostatic repulsion energy estimations , appears to be more plausible than the class i arrangement .",
    "recently this interpretation of the refined crystal structure has been found to be controversial .",
    "the lack of atomic long - range co and , as a result , an intermediate valence regime below the verwey transition were proposed.@xcite it is argued that the difference of the average fe - o distances between compressed and expanded feo@xmath50 octahedra , which could be considered as a maximum limit of charge disproportionation , has the same order as the total sensitivity ( including experimental errors ) of the bond - valence - sum method .",
    "this remarkable controversy shows that the understanding of the system is far from satisfactory .",
    "in this paper we present results of band structure calculations which have been performed for the low - temperature crystal structure of fe@xmath0o@xmath1 recently refined at 90 k.@xcite the refined cell parameters used in calculations are @xmath51   , @xmath52   , @xmath53   , and @xmath54 .",
    "the monoclinic @xmath40 unit cell contains eight formula units .",
    "there are eight different types of iron atom sites : two tetrahedrally coordinated @xmath24 sites and six @xmath14 sites octahedrally coordinated by six o atoms .",
    "the electronic structure of magnetite was calculated self - consistently using the local - spin - density approximation and lsda+@xmath2 approach @xcite with the linear muffin - tin orbitals ( lmto ) method in the atomic - sphere approximation.@xcite the radii of the muffin - tin spheres were taken as @xmath55= 2.125 a.u . and @xmath56= 2.0 a.u .",
    "fifteen kinds of empty spheres were introduced to fill up the interatomic space . as was shown in ref .  , weak spin - orbit coupling does not appreciably affect the band structure of fe@xmath0o@xmath1 .",

    "interestingly , the crystal structure distortion taken explicitly in the monoclinic phase does not strongly affect the electronic structure of fe@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "in particular , the calculation results agree well with previous band structure calculations for the cubic phase.@xcite thus , the lsda gives a uniform half - metallic ferrimagnetic solution with partially filled bands originating from the minority spin @xmath5 orbitals of fe@xmath8 cations .",
    "an energy gap of @xmath101 ev opens in the majority spin channel between occupied fe@xmath8 @xmath60 and the bottom of the empty fe@xmath59 states .",
    "the lower part of the valence band ( below @xmath613.5 ev ) is mainly formed by o @xmath62 states with a bonding hybridization with fe @xmath9 states , whereas bands near the fermi level , between @xmath613.5 and 2 ev , have a predominant contribution of fe @xmath9 states .",
    "it is worth recalling that fe@xmath8 3@xmath13 states are split by the cubic component of a ligand field into a triplet @xmath5 and a doublet @xmath63 .",
    "already in the @xmath33 phase the local symmetry of fe@xmath8 sites ( @xmath64 ) is lower than cubic and the trigonal component of the ligand field splits @xmath5 states into a singlet @xmath65 and doublet @xmath66 . in the monoclinic lt phase the symmetry is further lowered by the distortions and all the degeneracy is lifted .",
    "nevertheless , the cubic component of the ligand field , which is determined by the relative strength of fe @xmath9o @xmath62 hybridization of @xmath67 and @xmath68 type , remains dominant , whereas the splitting within @xmath5 and @xmath63 subbands is smaller than the corresponding bandwidth .",
    "this allows one to label the corresponding states as @xmath5 and @xmath63 .",

    "fe@xmath72 , fe@xmath73 and fe@xmath74 , fe@xmath75  are very similar and we present the dos averaged over the corresponding pairs , dropping @xmath76 and @xmath77 indices .",
    "the splitting of fe@xmath8 states due to the octahedral component of the ligand field is roughly of 1 ev .",
    "this is considerably smaller than the exchange splitting between minority and majority spin states , which is @xmath103 ev , and consistent with the high - spin state of fe cations .",
    "the absolute values of magnetic moments obtained by lsda are 3.14@xmath29 , 3.30@xmath29 , 3.44@xmath29 , 3.27@xmath29 , and 3.38@xmath29 for fe@xmath59 and fe@xmath78 cations , respectively .",
    "the total ferromagnetic moment per fe@xmath0o@xmath1 formula unit is 4.0@xmath29 .",
    "it should be noted that in contrast to experimental data the lsda calculations result in a half - metallic solution without charge ordering .",
    "apparently , the change of the lsda electronic structure , produced by the crystal structure distortion from the cubic to the monoclinic phase , is not sufficient to explain the charge ordering and metal - insulator transition in fe@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the electron - electron correlations , mainly in the @xmath9 shell of fe cations , play a significant role .",
    "in order to account for the strong electronic correlations in the fe @xmath9 shell , at least on the static hartree - fock level , we calculated the electronic structure of the lt phase of fe@xmath0o@xmath1 using the lsda+@xmath2 method .",
    "previous studies proved this method to be quite successful in treating transition metal oxides with strong electron - electron correlations as well as systems with long - range order.@xcite the value of the @xmath2 parameter for fe cations estimated using different experimental and theoretical technics lies in the range of 4.5 - 6 ev.@xcite a reasonably good agreement of the calculated gap value of 0.18 ev with the experimental value @xcite of 0.14 ev at 10 k was obtained using the @xmath2 value of 5 ev .",
