    "recently , numerical simulations of many - body quantum systems based on matrix product states ( mps ) and their generalizations have called increasing attention as they offer an efficient way to study properties of their ground states and even thermal states .",
    "one of the main reasons of their popularity is their applicability to  in principle  any hamiltonians describing only local interactions on a spin chain and their possible generalizations to higher dimensions . the use of the so - called projected entangled pair states ( peps ) to approximate ground states of such kind of hamiltonians defined in higher dimensions ( e.g. on a square lattice )",
    "is considered very promising .",
    "( see e.g. ref.@xcite and references therein for a review of the topic . )",
    "these methods can provide efficient simulation of systems when other methods such as quantum monte carlo break down , e.g. in case of certain frustrated systems .",
    "it means for example that one can circumvent the so - called sign problem present in the monte carlo simulation .",
    "( note that there exist systems for which there is no other method available , not considering exact diagonalization which works only for small system sizes .",
    "one such system is e.g. the frustrated xx model . ref .",
    "@xcite )    obviously one of the main goals of investigating ground states is to explore phase transitions and characterize them as precisely as possible .",
    "despite the fact that by definition , the mps can only describe exponentially decaying correlations , one can obtain accurate results for certain quantities of phase transitions like in the ising model as it has been demonstrated in nearly all of the papers presenting an mps based algorithm .",
    "( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite where it has also been used for an ising model defined on a binary tree . ) models with not only nearest neighbor ( nn ) interactions and higher than second order transitions have not been studied extensively by means of mps .",
    "this paper has two goals : find a suitable efficient algorithm based on mps to simulate hamiltonians with second neighbor interactions and frustration , as well as demonstrate the use of universal tools , especially finite - entanglement scaling to study different types of phase transitions .",
    "its validity arises from general facts about critical points and the definition of the mps , hence it can be applied quite universally . as opposed to the usual finite - size",
    "scaling it may also have a better scaling for the computational costs if using the same maximal bond dimensions for both cases ( see below ) . here the 1-dimensional version of the transverse axial next nearest neighbor ising ( annni ) model has been chosen which is non - integrable and possesses a quite complex phase diagram , despite being the simplest model with nnn interactions .",
    "this model is notable due to several facts .",
    "as earlier studies have shown , unlike the ising model , it has a critical region , i.e. a 2d parameter region where it is critical .",
    "a probably infinite order phase transition also takes place ( besides second order phase transitions ) . as mentioned earlier",
    ", the detection of an infinite ( e.g. kosterlitz - thouless ) transition is a notoriously hard computational challenge , that s why a computationally beneficial method is needed . the same holds for exploring the physics of a critical region .    in order to study such a model one can choose a finite chain of length @xmath0 with periodic ( pbc ) or open boundary conditions ( obc ) and then look at the scaling of some physical quantities depending on @xmath0 and the bond dimension @xmath1 .",
    "it is known that the overall computational costs scales @xmath2 in the best case .",
    "the latter happens for example when the correlations are very small @xmath3 as it is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , however when @xmath4 e.g. it can be as large as @xmath5 and the precise behaviour of the scaling as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath0 is unclear .    note that in this paper , imps and imaginary time evolution are used , hence one works directly on the infinite lattice and the only scaling parameter is @xmath1 . in this case",
    "the computational cost in every small time step @xmath6 scales as @xmath2 . roughly speaking",
    ", convergence can be reached if : @xmath7 with the @xmath8 energy gap and @xmath9 the number of time steps . approaching to a critical point , @xmath8 vanishes as a function of the effective correlation length @xmath10 , and at the same time we also have a scaling relation like @xmath11 ( see below ) . with this in mind , it can be estimated how the overall computational time scales as a function of @xmath1 and one sees why it is slower than @xmath2 near to a critical point .",
    "for instance , if @xmath12 , @xmath13 then @xmath9 should scale as @xmath14 that makes the overall scaling @xmath15 .",
    "previous work about finite - d scaling can be found e.g. in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "now the idea is to study the scaling of physical quantities not as a function of the system size , but simply as a function of the bond dimension @xmath1 . instead of finite - size scaling",
    "this can be called as finite - d or finite - entanglement scaling as a mps with a given @xmath1 can contain a finite amount of entanglement . as it will be argued in section iv .",
    "the overall computation cost of finite - d scaling can be considerably reduced compared to that of the usual finite - size scaling .",
    "in fact , this turns out to be the case for the presented model as well as for the ising and heisenberg models , and essentially this depends on the central charge . the key point to this computational cost reduction",
    "is our off critical scaling ansatz ( [ finitescaling ] ) for the correlation length as a function of @xmath1 which turns out to be computationally more beneficial than that of used in ref .",
    "@xcite for the entanglement entropy .",
    "clearly , our methods can be applied straightforwardly to any other 1d model with nn and nnn interactions , such as the @xmath16 heisenberg model , but can also be adapted for the 2d version using peps . despite the polynomial computational time scaling , unfortunately its exponent is so high in the 2d case that in practice one can apply only very small bond dimensions providing only a few and ambiguous results that are not yet sufficient for numerical analysis .",
    "consider the following hamiltonian on an infinite chain of spin-@xmath17 particles @xmath18 this can be considered as the 1 dimensional version of the lattice model with axial next nearest neighbor interactions ( annni ) .",
    "if the next nearest neighbor ( nnn ) interaction term describes antiferromagnetic interactions ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 then the system is frustrated .",
    "note that basically two parameters determines the physical properties of model e.g. @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "changing the basis of every second spin appropriately by rotating around the axis @xmath23 leads to @xmath24 , so one can switch from an antiferromagnetic nn interaction to a ferromagnetic one and vice - versa , leaving the nnn interaction unchanged .",
    "however , there is no rotation switching all couplings to ferromagnetic , thus the sign of the nnn interactions is crucial and besides the magnetic field of @xmath25 the ratio @xmath26 plays the key role in determining the physical properties .",
    "from now on let us set @xmath27 and @xmath19 yielding competing ferro - and antiferromagnetic nn and nnn couplings .",
    "the mps representation of an infinite , translational invariant chain of @xmath28-dimensional systems looks like @xmath29 with site independent sets of matrices @xmath30 of dimension @xmath31 .",
    "the normalization constraint requires that the largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix @xmath32 has to be unique and equals to @xmath33 .",
    "if it s degenerate ( as it happens e.g. for the state @xmath34 ) then it can cause troubles in some types of the algorithms that work with unique leading eigenvectors ( ref .",
    "@xcite , ref .",
    "nevertheless , in order to overcome this one can apply tricks like appropriate rotations of some basis vectors , but due to the lots of computations like leading eigenvectors , inverses and squares of matrices these algorithms turn out to be costly . another representation ref .",
    "@xcite uses the schmidt coefficients in the diagonal matrices @xmath35 explicitly as follows @xmath36 with the normalization constraints @xmath37 @xmath38 in the general case when the dimensions of @xmath39 and @xmath40 can be different .",
    "the infinite time evolving block decimation ( itebd ) ref .",
    "@xcite uses this description and in case of nn interactions two neighboring sites are updated after the action of @xmath41 .",
    "one builds up a larger matrix occupying the mps matrices of the two sites @xmath42 and @xmath43 and decomposing them through a singular value decomposition to obtain the new matrices .",
    "a normalization step can be interpreted as a zero time update : we just build a larger matrix and decompose it .",
    "the details can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    several ways exist to do the updates in the case at hand .",
    "one option is the use of ` superspins ' ( made of 2 neighboring spins ) . to this end",
    "let us join together every second neighboring pairs of spins to form block spins with @xmath44 dimensional basis as @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "in this way we get a translational invariant hamiltonian with only nn interactions acting between these 4 dimensional block spins so we can use the simplest algorithms designed for this case but with @xmath48 and a bit more complicated nn term .    in our scheme , for example",
    "the operator @xmath49 acting on the sites @xmath50 in the original lattice is interpreted as an operator acting on the single superspin labelled by @xmath42 , while @xmath51 describes an interaction between the superspins at the position @xmath42 and @xmath52 .",
    "similarly @xmath53 is a nn interaction between the superspins , however it describes a nnn coupling between the original spins . with this in mind",
    "one can easily construct the operators @xmath54 in the new basis .",
    "we make use of the ` superspins ' and the update method described in ref.@xcite .",
    "the computation time in every step scales as @xmath2 but as opposed to the previous method like in ref.@xcite , one does not need to compute neither leading eigenvectors nor inverses or squares of non diagonal matrices hence it is faster and there is no problem with degenerate eigenvalues .",
    "in order to characterize phase transitions using imps one needs to study how some special quantities scale as a function of the applied bond dimension @xmath1 .",
    "let us denote the entropy of entanglement computed from the imps by @xmath55 and the correlation length @xmath10 .",
    "it is known that in the critical points @xmath55 converges logarithmically with corrections of order @xmath56 as @xmath57 with @xmath58 being the central charge and @xmath59 only depends on @xmath58 for large enough @xmath1 as @xmath60 the scaling of the correlation length looks like @xmath61 again with corrections of @xmath56 , see ref .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for more details .    in practice",
    "however , one should go in the other way round : testing the scaling relations one wants to decide whether the system is critical or not by giving an estimate for the correlation length .",
    "the closer we are to the critical point the more delicate the problem due to the high correlation length .",
    "one has to decide if the limits @xmath62 and @xmath63 are finite or not .",
    "( @xmath64 and @xmath65 converge to the exact values of the infinite system as the trotter errors tend to zero . ) it can be especially hard for example in the vicinity of a kosterlitz - thouless transition when the inverse of the true correlation length @xmath66 tends to zero very quickly as we are approaching the critical point .",
    "as in finite - size scaling let us assume some scaling function for @xmath10 as @xmath67    clearly , @xmath68 for large @xmath1 if @xmath69 .",
    "it enables us to define @xmath70 with @xmath71 , for which @xmath72 if @xmath73 and @xmath74 for large @xmath23 .",
    "note that besides these limit properties we will not make any further observations about the form of @xmath75 , just use a simple ansatz what will be justified by the numerics to be a good indicator for the non - critical behaviour .",
    "( see below the similar ansatz function for the finite - size case ) .",
    "so for instance , the following simple ansatz meets these requirements @xmath76    near the critical regime @xmath65 is big but not infinite and for a not big enough @xmath1 it behaves very similarly to ( [ xiscaling ] ) and one can not distinguish it from the critical scaling .",
    "so the natural question arises : for a given and large but finite @xmath65 near the critical regime , at least how big @xmath1 should be applied in order to rule out the critical scaling with some reasonable accuracy ?",
    "essentially it depends on the ratio of @xmath77 and @xmath78 .    in order to decide whether a given point is critical or",
    "not one should test the linearity of @xmath79 against @xmath77 as a null hypothesis .",
    "if it can be rejected then one can fit a trial function according to ( [ finitescaling ] ) and ( [ ansatz ] ) to obtain an estimate for @xmath80 .",
    "note that([finitescaling ] ) resembles of the finite - size scaling of the entropy of the half chain of length @xmath0 applied in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath81 with the same ansatz for @xmath82 but now one has to plug @xmath83 . note that this simple ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) for @xmath82 has the right limits but for intermediate values it is not correct , however it turns out to be good approximation for @xmath84 and a good indicator for non - criticality by the numerics .",
    "one can obtain ( universal ) series expansions for @xmath82 in the small and large limit theoretically , see ref .",
    "one can also confront this with our ansatz which incorporates the to limits .    of course here , for a given @xmath0 , the applied bond dimension ( or the number of states kept in each dmrg iteration ) should be `` high enough '' .",
    "in our case however , we only have the bond dimension as an input parameter which simplifies the picture . besides , the main advantage is as follows : having the same @xmath85 for the infinite system , for the same accuracy one has considerably smaller computational cost if the scaling exponent @xmath86 .",
    "( this will turn out to be the case in the present model as the central charges are found to be @xmath87 implying @xmath88 and @xmath89 implies @xmath90 . ) in any case , the time cost of one update step scales as @xmath91 in the finite size case as opposed to @xmath2 for the infinite case . now",
    ", if one takes the same maximal bond dimension @xmath1 for both cases , then for the finite-@xmath1 scaling one needs to also apply some smaller @xmath1-s which makes the overall time costs scale as @xmath92 ( at most , if one passes along @xmath93 ) .",
    "on the other hand in case of finite - size scaling the time costs @xmath94 . in order to detect off critical scaling with the same accuracy one",
    "expects the necessary maximal length @xmath0 in the finite - size case must be bigger than the maximal @xmath1 in the finite - d case , if @xmath86 .",
    "nevertheless , this can be estimated by studying the scaling anzatz ( [ finitescaling ] ) and ( [ finitescaling2 ] ) . in terms of @xmath1",
    "this would result in an overall effective scaling higher than @xmath95 , in the finite - size case , obtained by the assumption @xmath96 .",

    "we try to explore the phase boundaries by looking at the correlation lengths as a function of the parameters and the second derivative of the energy .",
    "a kosterlitz - thouless type transition is conjectured between the floating and the paramagnetic(pm ) phase where the derivatives of the energy are useless indicators so the expected divergence of the correlation length is checked only . in the critical points we also check the finite entanglement scaling laws and find very good agreement with the theoretical results .",
    "moreover , in some special points we calculate the critical charges as well as the correlation scaling exponents .",
    "we intend to determine some points of the line of phase transitions between the distinct phases and check these relations as well as the finite - entanglement scaling and compute the central charge .",
    "there are three lines of phase transitions , two of them are of second order while an infinite order transition is expected for the third one which needs a special care .",
    "we also try to detect the floating phase when @xmath97 and @xmath98 is large , since its existence for arbitrary large @xmath98 is still an open question .      in case of the ising model , in the vicinity of the critical point as a function of the magnetic field , the correlation length and the magnetization diverges as @xmath99 and the energy and its first derivative are continuous but its second derivative diverges at @xmath100 . using @xmath101 we get @xmath102 by looking at the extrema of the finite derivative @xmath103 . at the transition corresponding to @xmath104 we find the same behaviour for the energy as a function of @xmath105 and a very good agreement with @xmath106 as in the simple ising case : @xmath107 comes from the linear fit on the figure below .",
