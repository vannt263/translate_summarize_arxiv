    "the nontrivial substructure of a nucleon manifests itself in the existence of the internally excited states , i.e.  baryon resonances or isobars .",
    "one possibility to describe these subnucleonic effects in modern nuclear models is the addition of exotic components , the so - called isobar configurations , to the conventional nuclear wave functions .    comparing different approaches ( for comprehensive reviews",
    "see e.g.  @xcite ) it was found that the strongest isobar admixture in nuclei stems from the @xmath2(1232 ) resonance .",
    "the exchange of @xmath14 and @xmath15 mesons may result in virtual @xmath16 and @xmath17 states .",
    "most theoretical and experimental investigations of the @xmath2 isobar configuration have been done for the few - body systems @xmath18h and @xmath19he , and to a smaller degree for heavier nuclei . at the same time , the amount of the virtual @xmath2 isobars in heavier nuclei with their higher density is expected to be more essential than in lighter nuclei . here",
    "we would like to mention the explicit calculation  @xcite which resulted in a 3.2% probability for @xmath2 components in the @xmath0c ground state .",
    "as for the experimental search for the isobar admixture in nuclei with @xmath20 , the observation of @xmath2 knock - out from @xmath21be  @xcite and the recent double charge exchange experiment @xmath22 on @xmath19h , @xmath23he , @xmath24li , @xmath25li , @xmath26c , @xmath27zr , and @xmath28pb  @xcite are of the greatest interest .",
    "the first experiment  @xcite was carried out at the proton beam of the synchrocyclotron at the petersburg nuclear physics institute where the inclusive differential cross sections for the @xmath21be(@xmath29he ) reaction at the proton energy of 1  gev have been measured .",

    "the observed enhancement of the @xmath32 cross section was interpreted as resulting from a contribution of a preexisting @xmath33 component of the nuclear wave function .",
    "the corresponding data analysis points to the probability of existence of the virtual @xmath2 isobars in the above mentioned nuclei at a level of @xmath34 .    the photo- and electroproduction processes as a test of @xmath2 admixture in nuclei were considered in ref .",

    ".    the small size of the isobar admixture in nuclei hampers the experimental observation of the @xmath2 component .",
    "the main difficulty consists in separating the different background mechanisms leading to the same final state .",
    "we have solved this problem by measuring the photoproduction cross section for @xmath43 pairs in the reaction @xmath44 the measurements were performed in the kinematical region of high momentum transfer to the residual nuclear system @xmath45 , whereas the background processes favour the small momentum transfer range .",
    "the use of reactions of the type ( [ gammaa ] ) has two main advantages , outlined also in our previous paper  @xcite .",
    "firstly , charge conservation prevents the creation of the @xmath5 isobar by photons impinging on a single nucleon .",
    "thus , the interpretation of the experimental results in terms of knocked - out @xmath2 isobars is simplified . secondly ,",
    "since the virtual @xmath2 isobars are produced in nn collisions , it is reasonable to expect that the probability of finding a @xmath2 isobar in a nucleus is quadratic in the nuclear density .",
    "therefore , the search for the @xmath2 components in electromagnetic reactions is preferred since the photon beam is able to probe the whole nuclear volume up to the region of the highest densities . also because of the reduced initial state interaction , a more direct test of isobar configurations can be carried out with electromagnetic probes than with strongly interacting probes .",
    "our experimental setup is described in section  2 . in section  3",
    "we briefly summarize the general formalism of the @xmath2 knock - out model .",
    "next the estimation of the background contributions as well as the analysis of the data are performed . after the determination of the kinematic region where the background effects are negligible",
    ", we analyse the data under the assumption that the @xmath3 pairs found in the detectors are the product of the @xmath4 process which starts from the @xmath5 constituent preexisting in a target nucleus .",

    "after leaving the vacuum tube of the accelerator , the photon beam was confined by two lead collimators with an aperture of 6  mm and 10  mm in diameter and cleaned in a sweeping magnet ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "at the target position the photon beam had a spot size of 16  mm in diameter and an intensity of about @xmath48 equivalent quanta per second .",
    "the shape of the bremsstrahlung spectrum was described by the schiff distribution  @xcite .",
    "the total energy of the photon flux during the runs was measured by the gauss - quantameter ( @xmath49 in fig .",

    "a carbon plate of a natural isotopic composition and @xmath52 nuclei/@xmath53 in thickness was employed as a target .",
    "its dimensions were 4  cm in height and 6  cm in width .    as is shown in fig .  1 , the experimental setup includes two coplanar arms detecting the positive pion and the proton in coincidence .",
    "a strong focusing magnetic spectrometer  @xcite was set at an angle  @xmath54 = 54@xmath55 with respect to the photon beam in order to select @xmath56 with mean momentum  @xmath57 = 181  mev / c .",
    "earlier this spectrometer was used for measurements of a deuteron photodisintegration asymmetry below pion threshold  @xcite and in measurements of the @xmath0c@xmath58 reaction cross section in the second resonance region  @xcite .",
    "the angular and the momentum acceptances were determined by a monte carlo calculation taking into account the beam size , the angle of the target with respect to the beam , multiple scattering , energy loss , and pion decay .",
    "the solid angle @xmath59 covered @xmath60  sr ( azimuthal and polar angular acceptances were @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively ) and the momentum acceptance @xmath63 was @xmath64 .",
    "the scintillation hodoscope  @xcite located in the focal plane of the spectrometer determined the pion momentum with a resolution of @xmath65 = 1.2  % .",
    "this value includes the contribution due to those muons from pion decay in flight which reached the telescope .",
    "the proton channel included a @xmath66 plastic scintillation counter hodoscope and two auxiliary counters @xmath67 with absorbers intended for monitoring the proton channel stability .",
    "the @xmath68 detector included three scintillation counters of the dimensions @xmath69",
    "cm@xmath19 , which were located on top of each other at a distance of 64 cm from the target . a single @xmath71 counter in front defined the solid angle of the proton channel to @xmath72 = 0.26  sr .",

    "the absolute energy calibration of the proton channel and the measurement of the proton counter responses as functions of the particle coordinate position were performed by using a secondary proton beam selected by the magnetic spectrometer of the pion channel by positioning the @xmath75 counters behind the magnet . within the range of the proton energy @xmath76  mev the analysis of the signals from the photomultipliers of the @xmath71 and @xmath68 counters allowed to determine the polar angle and the energy of the detected proton with position independent accuracies better than @xmath77 and @xmath78  mev , respectively . the nuclear interaction of the proton with the scintillators contributed in part to these values which where determined by the calibration .",
    "the accuracy of the azimuthal angle  @xmath79 was determined by the counter dimensions to @xmath80 .    for online monitoring of the stability of the proton detector , two narrow auxiliary scintillators @xmath67 with absorbers",
    "have been set up behind the @xmath66 hodoscope ( see fig .  1 ) . simultaneously with the accumulation of the @xmath3 events we measured individual pulse height spectra of the @xmath81 and @xmath68 scintillators , which were triggered by the coincident pulses from the @xmath82- and @xmath67-counters .",
    "two ranges of the spectra corresponding to minimal pion and minimal proton energies were identified and monitored .",
    "these energies were determined by the absorber thickness and they were chosen within the proton channel operating range in such a way that light responses in the @xmath68-counters were corresponding to @xmath83  mev and @xmath84  mev , respectively .",
    "to reduce cosmic background , the focal plane detectors of the pion channel were covered with a big - area scintillation counter @xmath85 working in the anti - coincidence mode .",
    "the final trigger was formed only during the accelerator pulse , which provided a cosmic background suppression to the level of less than 2@xmath86 .",
    "further data analysis suppressed the cosmic background to a negligible fraction .",
    "background measurements were taken using only the pion channel with mean momentum of 181  mev / c .",

    "the measured reaction yields were corrected for the following effects :    1 .",
    "the level of the accidental coincidences depended on the proton energy and was estimated from the intensity of the events lying outside the time - correlation peak of the @xmath3 coincidences .",
    "this level changed from 6@xmath86 to @xmath87 in the region @xmath88  mev and remained less than @xmath87 for @xmath89  mev ; 2 .",
    "a portion of the particles was lost due to nuclear interaction of the protons and pions in the material of the target and detector .",
    "the associated correction was momentum dependent and reached 6@xmath86 at maximum ; 3 .",
    "the pion decay correction was found to be 18  @xmath86 ; 4 .",

    "fifty - three @xmath3 events have been detected in total .",
    "2 shows the distribution of these events in the proton emission angle and the proton energy for the two values of electron beam energy .",
    "before dealing further with the analysis of the obtained results we would like to outline the general ideas which have governed the calculations for this investigation .",
    "firstly , we note that the distribution of events shown in fig .  2 exhibits a rather pronounced structure formed by the two groups at @xmath90  mev and @xmath91  mev . in the kinematic conditions of our experiment",
    "the larger proton energy @xmath92 implies a larger momentum transferred to the residual nucleus .",
    "since the isobar configurations are responsible mainly for high momentum components of the nuclear wave function , a higher recoil momentum of the residual nuclear system is favored in this case . keeping this in mind",
    "one may assume that the @xmath93 reaction on preexisting @xmath2 s results in the right groups of the events in fig .",
    "2 . as is confirmed by a calculation ( described below ) , the remaining reaction channels forming the background lead to the events localized in the left part of the figure . in accordance with the observed structure of the distribution of events we used two different models for the data analysis .",
    "the first one , hereafter called the @xmath2 knock - out model , assumes the @xmath3-production to proceed through the decay of the knocked - out @xmath5 .",
    "the second model , also called in the literature the valencia model  @xcite , was explored to describe the essential part of background reactions .",
    "we outline below the main ingredients of both models and apply them to the analysis of the data .      to interpret the experimental data in the region of high momentum transfer",
    ", we used the approach in which the @xmath3 pair production was considered as a result of the @xmath4 process on a @xmath5 preexisting in the target nucleus .",
    "the differential cross section for the reaction @xmath0c@xmath39 within the @xmath2 knock - out model was discussed in our earlier work  @xcite .",
    "the main ideas are presented here for convenience .",
    "the differential cross section may be written in the form  @xcite @xmath94 where the subscripts @xmath95 , @xmath14 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 stand for the photon , pion , proton , and the final nucleus , respectively .",
    "the total energies and momenta of the participating particles are denoted by @xmath68 and @xmath98 .",
    "the squared modulus of the reaction amplitude @xmath99 in the laboratory system is @xmath100 here , the subscript @xmath2 stands for the @xmath2 isobar , @xmath101 is the elementary @xmath102 amplitude .",
    "the expression  ( [ m2 ] ) was obtained employing the impulse approximation and using the closure relation when summing over all the states of the undetected residual nuclear system .",
    "the function @xmath103 in ( [ m2 ] ) represents the @xmath5 isobar momentum distribution in the ground state of the initial nucleus .",
    "the factor @xmath104 takes into account the absorption of the produced particles @xmath56 and @xmath96 inside the nucleus .",
    "it depends on the pion and proton energies and their opening angle .",
    "the momentum distribution @xmath105 obeys the following normalization condition @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the number of @xmath5 isobars per nucleon in the ground state of the @xmath0c nucleus and @xmath108  =  12 is its mass number .    the elementary @xmath109 amplitude @xmath110 was obtained within the diagrammatic approach .",
    "the model was based on the coupling of photons to pions , nucleons and @xmath2 isobars using effective lagrangians .",

    "the valencia model  @xcite is well suited to estimate the background contributions to the direct @xmath2 knock - out reaction under investigation .",
    "it has already been applied in several studies of similar reactions  @xcite .",
    "this model incorporates all major photoabsorption mechanisms as one- , two- and three - nucleon absorption as well as single - pion production .",
    "these photoabsorption mechanisms are treated microscopically in a quantum - mechanically correct way taking into account the relevant photon - nucleon interaction amplitudes . within the local density approximation the nuclear matter results",
    "are transferred to finite nuclei .",
    "the nuclear many - body problem is simplified by using a fermi gas model .",
    "the particles which are produced in the photoabsorption process are then propagating independently through the target nucleus .",
    "they are traced in a phenomenological way considering the most important n - n and @xmath14-n reaction channels until the primary and/or secondary hadrons leave the target nucleus .",
    "one of the main assumptions of this model is the treatment of the knocked out particles on their path through the medium as on - shell particles .",
    "the angular distributions are included in a phenomenological manner . with these ingredients for each event ,",
    "the final momentum of each hadron is the result of a monte carlo type calculation .",
    "the valencia model describes total cross sections or dominant reaction channels in the @xmath2 resonance region , e.g. as ( @xmath95,np ) or ( @xmath95,@xmath14,n ) , quite well ( refs .",
    "however , for some of the less important reaction channels sizeable deviations can be found as these are sensitive mostly to final state interactions .",
    "for the particular kinematics of ref .",
    "@xcite a 50% overestimation of the ( @xmath95,p@xmath134 ) cross sections was found for the photon energy range of @xmath135  mev .    in order to investigate the sensitivity within the present kinematics",
    "some parameters have been varied . in fig .",
    "4 we present the upper and lower boundaries for the cross section given by the valencia model at the photon energy @xmath136 = 450  mev . in particular , to account for nucleon - nucleon correlations the nucleon wave functions are modified by a jastrow type correlation @xmath137 .",
    "this has a direct effect on the momentum distributions and thus at the relative strength of competing reaction channels .",

    ". the important observation of these trial calculations is the proton energy spectrum which changes shape and strength , however , above @xmath140  mev the background contribution remains very small .      with the aim of determining the kinematic region where the reaction mechanisms caused by non - nucleon degrees of freedom may dominate ,",
    "the analysis was carried out for the contributions from the background @xmath43 pair production mechanisms .",
    "for this purpose we employed the valencia model .",
    "the calculations were performed for three photon energies , namely @xmath141 = 350 , 400 and 450  mev .",

    "the differential cross sections as a function of the proton kinetic energy  @xmath92 for @xmath141 = 400 and 450  mev have been averaged over the acceptances of the other observables and are shown in the histograms of fig .",
    "no result for the lowest photon energy is presented , because the corresponding cross section is negligible . according to the valencia model ,",
    "the @xmath43 yield at our experimental conditions results mainly from the sequential processes : @xmath142 and @xmath143 pair production followed by charge - exchange rescattering of the @xmath144-mesons to @xmath56-mesons and the neutrons to protons .",
    "as one can see in fig .  5 ,",
    "the maximum of the background reactions is located at the small proton energies .",
    "this is due to the fact that the quasi - free @xmath145 and @xmath144p production dominates in the region of small momenta of the residual nuclear system , which in the kinematic conditions of our experiment corresponds to small proton energies .",
    "this is corroborated by fig .",
    "6 , where the residual nucleus momentum  @xmath146 is presented as a function of the proton energy  @xmath92 for various values of the proton angle  @xmath147 .",

    "this photoabsorption mechanism is not included in the valencia model .",
    "an estimate of the double pion production background has been done within the framework of the quasi - free approximation , whose formalism is presented in detail in ref .  @xcite . for proton energies",
    "@xmath148 80  mev the calculation shows that the net effect from this process is less than @xmath50 at @xmath46 = 500  mev ( see fig .  5 ) .    as can be seen from fig .  2",
    ", a considerable reaction yield is observed in the range @xmath150  mev .",
