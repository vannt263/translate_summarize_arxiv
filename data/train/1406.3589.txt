    "experimental and theoretical studies of the transport , electronic and optical properties of the armchair graphene nanoribbon ( gnr ) have attracted much attention in recent years .",
    "one of the reason for this is that the gnrs used as the interconnects in graphene - based nanoelectronic and as the basic elements in the logic transistors could provide ultrahigh carrier mobility between the unbounded gapless 2d graphene monolayers .",
    "however , the opened band gap in gnr reduces considerably the mobility of the carriers @xcite .",
    "additional inevitable difficulties come from the fact that in contrast to gapless graphene monolayers , in which the bound impurity states are forbidden @xcite in gapped graphene @xcite and quasi 1d gnr @xcite the bound impurity states can be realized .",
    "the binding energies @xmath0 of the impurity electrons in the gnr of width @xmath1 reach the considerable amount of the order of @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , it was shown @xcite that impurity electrons , possessing energies close to the breit - wigner meta - stable resonances , contribute negligibly little to the conductance . clearly",
    ", the impurity centres suppress strongly the mobility of the gnrs .",
    "of course the binding effect of the impurity centres could be reduced by the technologically involved procedure of the improvent of the sample standard @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the less elaborate mechanism of the liberation of the carriers captured by the impurities is a much more immediate demand at the present time .",
    "the process of the ionization by an external electric field can be used as an instrument for the release of the blocked carriers .    besides , the quasi-1d structures , in particular the bulk semiconductors subject to strong magnetic fields @xcite , quantum wires ( qwrs ) @xcite and armchair gnrs @xcite are favorable for the formation of both the strictly discrete and meta - stable ( fano resonances ) @xcite impurity and exciton states adjacent to the ground and excited size - quantized energy levels , respectively . the latter are caused by the confinement effect associated with the magnetic field in bulk semiconductors and the boundaries of the qwrs and gnrs .",
    "the nature of the fano resonances comes from the inter subband coupling between the discrete and low - lying continuous rydberg states . with emergence of the electric field only one channel of the ionization",
    "is opened for the ground series of the rydberg discrete states , while the excited meta - stable states decay into two channels : the autoionization channel , open due to the inter - subband fano coupling , and the channel of the electric field ionization , related to the under - barrier tunneling ( fig .",
    "the interaction of these two channels of the ionization is of immediate interest .",
    "( color online ) .",
    "the combined potential @xmath3 , formed by the impurity potential @xmath4 ( [ e : pot ] ) and electric field @xmath5 adjacent to the ground and first excited size - quantized energy levels @xmath6 ( [ e : ener ] ) with @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the continuous and discrete rydberg states are labeled by the indexes @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( ground state ) and @xmath10 ( first excited state ) , respectively.,width=325 ]    it is clear that the problem of the impurity states in the armchair gnr in the presence of a longitudinal electric field directed parallel to the gnr axis is important on account of two aspects : ( i ) its considerable interest in the context of basic research , and ( ii ) possible nano - electronic applications .",
    "narrow gnrs of several nanometers width are the best candidates among the other 1d structures for fundamental studies .",
    "the binding energies of the impurity electron in gnr exceed those in the corresponding semiconductor structures by a factor of about @xmath11 that in particular manifests itself in the strong electric fields , providing the complete ionization of the impurity states in gnr .",
    "gnrs seem to be a unique structure in which both channels of the auto- and electric field ionization are opened .",
    "the process of electric field ionization transforms the strictly bound and the fano resonant states into states of transporting carriers that in turn improve the conductance properties of the gnrs and of the nano - electronic devices into which these ribbons are incorporated .",
    "the finite lifetime of the quasi - discrete impurity states associated with the two - channel ionization should be taken into account in the practical use of the gnrs exposed to the electric field .",
    "there are two comments in order .",
    "first , the theoretical approaches to this problem are mostly based on numerical calculations ( density functional theory and bethe - salpiter equation @xcite , nonorthogonal tight - binding model @xcite , tight - binding scheme and hartree - fock approximation @xcite ) requiring significant computational efforts . only a few recent works",
    "elaborate on analytical methods . in ref .",
    "@xcite the bound and quasi - discrete impurity states in the armchair gnr have been studied by solving the dirac equation for a massless neutrino .",
    "ratnikov and silin @xcite empirically extended to the gnr the model earlier developed for the semiconductor qwr @xcite , and calculated the excitonic energy levels by the variational method and their red shift induced by the electric field .",
    "second , to our knowledge analytical results based on the dirac equation adequately describing the impurity electrons in gnrs subject to external electric field are not present in the literature .",
    "thus an analytical approach to the problem of the impurity states in biased armchair gnr is desirable .",
    "particularly it renders the basic physics transparent and governs the electronic , optical and transport properties of the graphene based devices .    in the present work we develop an analytical approach to the problem of the impurity state in the narrow armchair gnr in the presence of an external electric field directed parallel to the ribbon axis .",
    "the coulomb impurity attraction is taken to be much weaker than the influence of the ribbon confinement and much stronger than the effect of the electric field .",
    "the impurity centre can be positioned anywhere within the gnr .",
    "the 2d dirac equation for the massless neutrino subject to the coulomb and external uniform electric field is solved in the adiabatic approximation .",
    "this approximation implies the transverse motion of the electron governed by the ribbon confinement to be much faster than the longitudinal motion controlled by the impurity and external electric field .",
    "our approach is based on the matching of the wave functions in the intermediate regions .",
    "the latter separates the impurity interaction from the electric field interaction dominated regimes . in the approximation of the isolated size - quantized subbands",
    "the binding energies and widths of the quasi - discrete states as a function of the ribbon width , position of the impurity and the electric field are calculated in explicit form . also , the phases of the functions of the continuous spectrum specifying the s - matrix are derived . in the double - subband approximation",
    "the total widths of the first excited rydberg series of impurity states , associated with the ionization effect of the electric field and inter - subband fano coupling are calculated .",
    "also the capturing of the electron by the impurity potential for the lifetime determined by the electric field is explored .",
    "numerical estimates made for realistic gnr show that for narrow ribbons the impurity states in the presence of a weak electric field remain quite stable which is to be proven experimentally , while significantly strong field could unlock the captured electrons .",
    "the aim of this work is to clarify the ionization mechanism of the release of the strictly bound and quasi - bound impurity electrons yielding the increase of the mobility of the carriers in the gnr .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section 2 the general analytical approach",
    "is described . the complex quasi - discrete energy levels dictating the binding energies and energy widths caused by the electric field along with the phases of the wave functions of the continuous states",
    "are calculated in the single - subband approximation in section 3 .",
    "the combined effect of the autoionization of the fano resonant states and their ionization by the electric field is under consideration in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we discuss the obtained results and estimate the expected experimental values .",
    "section 6 contains the conclusions .",
