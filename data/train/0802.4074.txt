    "the purpose of the paper is two - fold : to introduce a multivariable creative telescoping method , and to apply it in a problem of quantum topology : namely the computation of the non - commutative @xmath0-polynomial of twist knots .",
    "our multivariable creative telescoping method allows us to compute linear recursions for sums of the form @xmath1 given a recursion relation for @xmath2 a the hypergeometric kernel @xmath3 .",
    "general theory implies the existence of a recursion relation for @xmath2 . however , in practice the computation is not manageable for twist knots , and there is no guarantee that the recursion relation will be of minimal order .",
    "our method does not guarantee a minimal order recursion relation either , however ( unlike the known methods ) it is manageable and produces a minimal order recursion relation the non - commutative @xmath0-polynomial for twist knots of @xmath10 twists .",
    "the non - commutative @xmath0-polynomial encodes the unique monic , linear , minimal order @xmath6-difference equation satisfied by the sequence of colored jones polynomials of the knot .",
    "our results give a new proof of the aj - conjecture for those knots .      in this section",
    "we recall the relevant laurent polynomial invariants of knots , such as the jones polynomial and its colored cousins . in 1985",
    "v. jones introduced the famous _ jones polynomial _ of a knot @xmath11 in 3-space , @xcite .",
    "the jones polynomial ( an element of @xmath12 $ ] ) is a powerful knot invariant which amongth other things detects cheirality , and it can be extended to a sequence @xmath13 of laurent polynomials by taking parallels of a knot @xmath11 .",
    "technically , @xmath14 $ ] is the quantum group invariant of the 0-framed knot using the @xmath15-dimensional representation of @xmath16 , and normalized by @xmath17 . for a detailed definition ,",
    "see @xcite and also @xcite . with this normalization",
    ", we have that @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the jones polynomial of @xmath11 .    for a given knot @xmath11 , the sequence of laurent polynomials @xmath13 is not random .",
    "to be precise , @xmath13 is @xmath6-_holonomic _ i.e. , it satisfies a linear @xmath6-difference equation ( which of course , depends on the knot ) with coefficients in @xmath20 .",
    "this fact , proven in @xcite , is an easy consequence of two facts :    * @xmath21 is a finite multisum of a proper @xmath6-hypergeometric term , as follows from the state - sum definition of the colored jones function ; see @xcite .",
    "* ultisums of proper @xmath6-hypergeometric terms are @xmath6-holonomic , as follows from the wz theory of wilf - zeilberger ; see @xcite .",
    "a @xmath6-holonomic sequence is annihilated by a unique monic homogeneous linear @xmath6-difference equation of smallest degree , and the corresponding monic polynomial in two @xmath6-commuting variables @xmath22 and @xmath23 is an invariant ( the so - called _ characteristic polynomial _ of the @xmath6-holonomic sequence .",
    "we define the _ non - commutative @xmath0-polynomial _",
    "@xmath24 of a knot @xmath11 to be the characteristic polynomial of @xmath13 .    in @xcite",
    ", it was conjectured by the first author ( the so - called aj conjecture ) that the specialization @xmath25 of @xmath24 should agree with the _ @xmath0-polynomial _ of a knot .",
    "the latter is an important invariant that parametrizes the @xmath26 character variety of the knot complement , as viewed from the boundary torus . for a detailed definition of the @xmath0-polynomial ,",
    "its properties and its applications to the geometry and topology of the knot complement , see @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath24 can be thought of as a deformation ( or quantization ) of the character variety .",
    "the jones polynomial of a knot is easily computable via skein theory with knots with , say , @xmath8 crossings ; see for example @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath0-polynomial of a knot is much harder to compute , and at present it is unknown for some knots with @xmath9 crossings .",
    "there are two general methods to compute the @xmath0-polynomial : an exact ( primarily elimination , and puiseux expansions ) developed by boyd @xcite and a numerical one developed by culler @xcite .",
    "the non - commutative @xmath0-polynomial and its possible relation with the @xmath0-polynomial of a knot is an important ingredient to the hyperbolic volume conjecture and its generalization .      for theoretical as well as experimental reasons it would be good to have explicit formulas for the non - commutative @xmath0-polynomial .",
    "so far , an explicit formula has been given for torus knots in @xcite ( using properties of the kauffman bracket skein module of the solid torus ) , as well as for the simplest hyperbolic @xmath27 knot in @xcite ( using an explicit single - sum formula for the colored jones function ) .",
    "the wz algorithm has been implemented ( see @xcite ) and together with explicit state - sum formulas for the colored jones function of an arbitrary planar projection given in @xcite , in principle one can obtain a linear @xmath6-difference equation for the colored jones function of an arbitrary knot .",
    "there are two problems with this approach :    * the number of summation variables in the multisum formulas is generally two less than the number of crossings , and the @xmath6-multisum algorithms appear to be slow for the current machines .",
    "* there is no guarantee that the various @xmath6-multisum algorithms will give a minimal order linear @xmath6-difference equation .",
    "in fact , in many cases ( where symmetry is involved ) , it has been observed that they fail to give the minimal order @xmath6-difference equation .",
    "see @xcite for well - known examples of this failure .    with respect to the first problem , we were unable to use the sofware of @xcite to compute a @xmath6-difference equation for our double sums .",
    "one might wonder whether problem ( b ) really occurs for the state - sums that originate in knot theory . as expected",
    ", this problem _ does _ occur .",
    "the knots @xmath28 and @xmath29 have double - sum formulas for their colored jones function .",
    "an application of the @xmath6-multisum package of @xcite was done by takata in @xcite who found out an explicit inhomogeneous @xmath6-difference equation of degree @xmath30 and @xmath30 respectively . on the other hand , as we shall see , there exist inhomogeneous @xmath6-difference equations of degree @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively .    in a different direction ,",
    "le used geometric methods of the kauffman bracket skein module and was able to prove the aj conjecture for most 2-bridge knots , as well as give a linear algebra algorithm that in principle computes the non - commutative @xmath0-polynomial ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm.1 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec.5.6.3 ) .",
    "the algorithm was implemented in maple by the second author , but proved to be too slow to run for the @xmath28 and @xmath29 knots .",
    "the main goal of the paper is to give an explicit formula for the non - commutative @xmath0-polynomial of twist knots with @xmath33 twists , where @xmath34 .",
