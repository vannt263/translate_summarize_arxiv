    "it is well known that the total correlation in a bipartite quantum system can be measured by quantum mutual information  @xcite , which may be divided into classical and quantum parts  @xcite .",
    "the quantum part is called quantum discord which is originally introduced by olliver and zurek  @xcite . recently",
    ", it has been aware of the fact that quantum discord is a more general concept to measure quantum correlation than quantum entanglement since there is a nonzero quantum discord in some separable mixed states  @xcite .",
    "in fact , quantum discord is a different type of quantum correlation than entanglement , and it can be considered as a more universal resource than quantum entanglement in some sense . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , although there is no quantum entanglement , quantum discord can also be responsible for the quantum computational efficiency of deterministic quantum computation with one pure qubit  @xcite .",
    "in addition , much recent attention has been paid to many relative topics of quantum discord  @xcite , such as quantum discord of open quantum systems .    we know that any realistic quantum systems interact inevitably with their surrounding environments , which introduce quantum noise into the systems . as a result",
    ", the quantum systems will lose their energy ( dissipation ) and/or coherence ( dephasing ) .",
    "thus it is of fundamental importance to know the influence of the environment on quantum correlation .",
    "in several recent papers  @xcite , the quantum correlation dynamics in open quantum systems have been studied .",
    "it was shown that the quantum correlation measured by quantum discord is more resistant against the environment than quantum entanglement  @xcite . for a certain class of states under markovian dynamics ,",
    "the quantum entanglement can disappear within a finite time , a phenomenon called by entanglement sudden death  @xcite , which has been widely investigated in recent years  @xcite .",
    "differently , quantum discord only vanishes asymptotically at infinite time  @xcite .",
    "moreover , for some special initial states , quantum correlation in a bipartite quantum system will not be affected by the decoherence environment during an initial time interval  @xcite .",
    "based on the above mentioned two facts that quantum discord is a useful resource for quantum information processing , and that quantum systems couple inevitably with their environment .",
    "naturally there are two interesting questions : ( i ) if the environment can enhance the quantum discord of the systems to realize the discord amplification ?",
    "( ii ) if we can obtain a stable quantum discord induced by the environment ? with these questions , in this paper , we study the dynamics of quantum discord between two non - interacting qubits immersed in a common ohmic environment .",
    "we show that it is possible to amplify and protect the quantum discord by the qubit - environment interaction under some conditions .",
    "especially , when the two qubits are identical , we find that the phase decoherence can induce a stable amplification of the initially - prepared quantum discord for certain @xmath0-type states .",

    "the degree of the discord amplification decreases with the increase of the detuning between the two qubits .",
    "the amplification and protection of the quantum discord can be understood as quantum effects induced by the environment since the two qubits interact neither directly , nor with a third system , but with the common reservoir with infinitely many degrees of freedoms .",
    "both of them are decoherence free .",
    "the stable amplification ( protection ) of the quantum discord can also be considered as a resonant ( large - detuning ) effect of the two qubits interacting with the common reservoir .",
    "it has been indicated that in general there does exist a sudden change of the quantum discord for the two qubits in the time evolution at a critic time point @xmath1 , and the discord amplification and protection may occur only in the time interval @xmath2 for certain @xmath0-type states . generally , the critic time depends on the initial - state parameters , characteristic parameters of the two qubits and their environment , and the qubit - reservoir interaction . the quantum discord will decay asymptotically to zero after the critic time .",
    "the creation of the stable amplification and protection of the quantum discord for the two qubits in a heat bath sheds new light on production of quantum states with long - living quantum discord .",
