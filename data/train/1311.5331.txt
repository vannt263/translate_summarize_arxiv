    "in recent years , topological insulators characterized by insulating bulk states and gapless conducting surface states have been studied intensively both theoretically and experimentally . @xcite specifically tetradymite compounds bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , bi@xmath0te@xmath1 and sb@xmath0te@xmath1 are found to be three - dimensional strong topological insulators with realistically large ( a few hundred mev ) bulk gap and simple surface electronic structure .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , even before the concept of topological insulator , great efforts were made to incorporate magnetism into these systems for potential diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) .",
    "for example , ferromagnetism was reported in cr doped bi@xmath0se@xmath1,@xcite mn and fe doped bi@xmath0te@xmath1 @xcite and v , cr and mn doped sb@xmath0te@xmath1 .",

    "@xcite    however , in experiment it is still challenging to incorporate stable ferromagnetism in the tis aforementioned .",

    "@xcite this may be related to different magnetic atoms distribution within the host material caused by the sample preparation , such as , temperature , flux ratio , and chemical potentials of constituent atoms .    in order to clarify this issue , we systematically investigate the stability , electronic and magnetic properties of 3@xmath6 transition metal ( tm ) elements v , cr , mn and fe doped bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , bi@xmath0te@xmath1 and sb@xmath0te@xmath1 using dft calculations and monte carlo simulations .",
