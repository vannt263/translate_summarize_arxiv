    "reverberation mapping @xcite is a technique applied to spectroscopic observations of type 1 agns to infer properties of the broad line - emitting region ( blr ) through characterizations of time delays between continuum and broad emission - line flux variations .",
    "this method has become extremely useful and quite successful in its current application of directly measuring blr radii and black hole masses ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "however , the fundamental objective of reverberation mapping , as its name implies , is to reconstruct or map the emissivity and velocity distribution of the blr line - emitting gas as a function of position as it ` reverberates ' in response to the flux variations of the ionizing continuum . because the position of the gas can be inferred through the emission - line time delay , @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , the resulting reconstruction is called a velocity  delay map ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is the best means , with current technology , to obtain direct knowledge about the geometry and kinematics of the blr .",
    "past attempts at producing velocity  delay maps ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have not yielded completely satisfactory results , primarily on account of limitations in temporal sampling , with inadequate time resolution or campaign duration or both .",
    "even given these limitations , previous studies have successfully measured time delays and black hole masses in over 40 type 1 agns ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , basic investigations into time delay differences between multiple emission lines have shown that the blr is virialized across broad line - emitting regions of different species ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "other studies of the velocity dependence of the lag across a single emission line region have shown suggestive evidence that the blr commonly contains a radial inflow component in addition to circular motions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the experiences from earlier reverberation programs have led to more recent campaigns that address the main observational obstacles encountered in the past  relative sampling rate , campaign duration , and data quality .",
    "consequently , there has been consistent success in measuring blr radii in new targets and remeasuring radii that now supersede previous , lower - precision or ambiguous measurements due to inadequate time - sampling ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter d09a ) . furthermore",
    ", these campaigns enable statistically significant detections of reverberation signals at higher velocity resolutions than have previously been found due mainly to the data restrictions discussed above .",
    "for example , @xcite revealed a clear signal of radial inflow within the h@xmath0  emission region of the blr in arp  151 , and @xcite show further evidence for distinct kinematic behavior in at least one other agn from the same program ( the lick agn monitoring project ) .",
    "here we report on results of our own recent high time - resolution monitoring program undertaken at five observatories .",
    "the first results of this program have already been published ( d09a ) , and additional results are in preparation ( k. d. denney et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation , hereafter d09b ) . in this letter",
    ", we present the most clear velocity - resolved reverberation signals recovered from this campaign .",
    "our results highlight three distinctly different blr kinematic signatures  inflow , outflow , and virialized motions  for three separate targets  ngc3227 , ngc3516 , and ngc5548 , respectively .",
    "these results reveal kinematic diversity in reverberation signals and underscore the importance of higher time resolution spectral monitoring .",
    "this represents an important step between measuring average blr response times and black hole masses to realizing the full potential of this technique through the recovery of a velocity  delay map .",
    "spectra of the nuclear regions of ngc3227 , ngc3516 , and ngc5548 were obtained from a combination of the 1.3 m telescope at mdm observatory , the 2.6 m shajn telescope of the crimean astrophysical observatory ( crao ) , and the plaskett 1.8 m telescope at dominion astrophysical observatory ( dao ) .",
    "spectroscopic observations targeted the h@xmath4 and [ oiii]@xmath5 emission line region of the optical spectrum .",
    "the top panels of figure [ fig : meanrms ] show the mean spectrum of each of the three targets based on the mdm observations , and the bottom panels show only the variable emission in the form of an rms spectrum for each object , respectively .",
    "emission line light curves were made from the integrated h@xmath0  flux measured above a linearly interpolated continuum fit to the mdm , crao , and dao spectra .",
    "in addition to spectral observations , we obtained supplemental @xmath6-band photometry from the 2.0-m multicolor active galactic nuclei monitoring ( magnum ) telescope at the haleakala observatories in hawaii @xcite , the 70-cm telescope of the crao , and the 0.4-m telescope of the university of nebraska ( unebr . ) .",
    "continuum light curves were created with observations from each @xmath6-band photometric data set and the average continuum flux density near rest frame @xmath75100    in each spectrum of the spectroscopic data sets .",
    "the reader is referred to d09a and d09b for details describing campaign observing setups and data reduction , flux calibration of the spectra , and intercalibration of the data sets to form the single set of optical continuum and h@xmath0  emission line light curves shown for each object in figure [ fig : lc4cc ] .",

    "column 7 is the ratio of the maximum to minimum flux in the light curves , and column 8 gives the adopted mean h@xmath0  time lag and uncertainties determined through the primary time series analysis which utilized the full h@xmath0  line profile and is described in detail for each object by d09b .",
    "the lag measurements between the continuum and h@xmath0  emission listed in table [ tab : lcstats ] represent the average time delay across the blr , measured from the centroid of the cross correlation function ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) produced during the time series analysis of the continuum and full h@xmath0  line profile light curves shown in figure [ fig : lc4cc ] ( see d09a for details ) . here , we focus on the velocity - resolved time series analysis we performed on each target to investigate the potential for recovering velocity - dependent time delays across the h@xmath0  emission line in order to infer the kinematic structure of the line emitting gas .",
    "we divided the h@xmath0  emission line into eight velocity - space bins , whose boundaries were determined by the division of the rms spectrum of each object into eight bins of equal flux , as depicted in the top panels of figure [ fig : reslags ] . compared to the line boundaries used for the full profile analysis leading to the light curves shown in figure [ fig : lc4cc ] , those used for this analysis",
    "were slightly narrowed in the cases of ngc3516 and ngc3227 in order to include only the most variable portions of the line profile , and boundaries were broadened for ngc5548 because the rms spectrum shows variability in the red h@xmath0wing that extends beneath the [ oiii]@xmath42 narrow emission line .",
    "light curves were created from measurements of the integrated h@xmath0flux in each bin and then cross correlated with the continuum light curves shown in figure [ fig : lc4cc ] .",
    "the bottom panels of figure [ fig : reslags ] show the lag measurements for each of these bins .",
    "error bars in the velocity direction represent the bin width .",
    "the evidence for a velocity - stratified blr response to continuum variations is clear in all three cases .",
    "interestingly , each case demonstrates a different kinematic signature : ( 1 ) outflow is indicated in ngc3227 , given the generally longer lags from red - shifted blr gas compared to the gas on the blue - shifted side of the line , ( 2 ) ngc3516 shows the opposite signature , with the blue side of the line lagging the red side  an indication that there is an infall component to the gas in this region , similar to that observed in arp  151 by @xcite , and ( 3 ) ngc5548 shows no radial gas motions , with relatively symmetric lags measurements extending to equally large velocities on both the red and blue sides of line  a clear indication of virialized gas motions , with the high - velocity line wings arising in gas closest to the central source ( see for examples of how velocity resolved responses can be related to different blr geometries ; see @xcite for a related tutorial ) .",
    "the velocity - resolved reverberation signals exhibited by the h@xmath0-emitting gas in the blr of these three sources show striking differences in kinematic behavior .",
    "this is of particular interest because black hole masses derived from reverberation mapping are only valid under the assumption of gravitational domination of the blr gas dynamics by the black hole .",
    "the influence of gravity on the blr in ngc3516 and ngc5548 is evidenced by the signatures of an infalling gas component in the former and a lack of significant radial motions of any kind in the latter ( see figure [ fig : reslags ] ) .",
    "the apparent evidence for outflow in the case of ngc3227 is a first for reverberation mapping . in some sense",
    ", this should be no surprise given the overwhelming evidence for large - scale mass loss from the inner regions of agns @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , this does call into question the assumptions that allow us to estimate the mass of the central object , though we do hasten to point out that an outflow at escape velocity would still allow us to measure the black hole mass with the levels of accuracy currently claimed .",
    "furthermore , the black hole mass we calculate for ngc3227 of @xmath43 , based on the lag in table 1 and the line dispersion of the broad h@xmath0  line measured from the rms spectrum ( see d09b ) , is consistent within the statistical and systematic uncertainties in this method to independent measurements using galactic stellar @xcite and gas @xcite dynamics .",
    "we also note that while the h@xmath0  emission line is blueward asymmetric , the h@xmath0profiles of ngc3516 and ngc5548 are even more so , so we ascribe little importance to this .",
    "it strikes us as likely that we are observing a complex system such as a two - component blr , in which there is an outflowing wind , in addition to a virialized , disk component . in this case , the mean lag that we measure , which is tracing the position of the majority of the line - emitting gas , arises from the disk component and is therefore under the gravitational influence of the black hole .",
    "meanwhile , the high - velocity , blueshifted emission with very short lags arises from a wind at the inner blr . additional support for this scenario comes from the double - peaked profile shape of the rms spectrum , suggesting a disk - like origin .",
    "a further test for the virial nature of the blr in ngc3227 is to search for reverberation signals from multiple emission lines in this object .",
    "data from this same campaign suggest that the ii4686 heii@xmath44  emission - line flux also varied significantly over the course of the campaign , and future work is planned to search for a reverberation signal from this variable line emission .",
    "the observations of virial motions in ngc5548 and the outflow in ngc3227 , in particular , are of further interest in the context of comparisons with previous velocity - resolved studies of a similar nature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these are largely focused on ngc5548 ( the object for which we have the most reverberation mapping data ) , and a comprehensive summary of many of these past studies is given by , who discuss the support for infalling blr gas as implied by these various results , particularly for low - ionization lines like h@xmath0 .",
    "this is in contrast to what we clearly see in ngc5548 and ngc3227 .",
    "it is entirely possible that the velocity fields in these regions could change as a function of accretion rate , luminosity state , or over dynamical timescales .",
    "interpretation of these new results is problematic and probably will remain so with only a handful of examples at single epochs . at this point ,",
    "generalizing from these few sources is premature .",
    "in this work , we have presented three clear cases of differing velocity signatures of h@xmath0-emitting gas from the blr of three nearby agns , demonstrating the diversity and probable complexity of the kinematics in this region .",
    "our ability with this work and that of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) to recover statistically significant velocity - resolved reverberation responses for multiple objects is principally due to successful completion of campaigns in which high quality , homogeneous observations were obtained over long durations ( i.e. , multiples of the reverberation lags ) with a sampling rate that was high compared to the relevant timescales being investigated .",
    "velocity - resolved reverberation mapping studies such as described here are the next step toward producing a velocity  delay map , which will reconstruct the two - dimensional kinematic structure of the blr .",
    "this , in turn , will allow further insight into the geometry and dynamics of the blr , potentially leading to estimates of its inclination and ultimately reducing the systematic uncertainties in @xmath1 determinations . in particular , placing direct observational constraints on the value of the reverberation mapping mass scale factor , @xmath45 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , even in individual objects , could reduce the scatter in the @xmath1@xmath46 relation for agns @xcite . despite the diversity in blr kinematic signatures seen here",
    ", we do not see any systematic trends in the location of these objects on the @xmath47@xmath46 relation , suggesting that any effects the different velocity fields of these objects have on their black hole mass estimates are within the current scatter in this relationship .",
    "more detailed information about the velocity fields of these objects is needed to say anything further on the effect these kinematic differences have on their black hole mass measurements .",
    "future work will focus on revealing more structure in blr velocity fields as we work to create velocity ",
