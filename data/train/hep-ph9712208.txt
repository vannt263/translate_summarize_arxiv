    "a number of new experiments at cern , slac , desy , bnl was proposed to investigate in more detail polarized particle interactions and to measure with good accuracy polarized parton distributions . up to now polarized deep inelastic scattering experiments",
    "have measured only the longitudinal twist-2 spin structure function @xmath4 and set an upper limit on the structure function @xmath5 which contains a twist-3 contribution . polarized hadron - hadron experiments measured large single spin asymmetries in inclusive production of different particles ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) and in elastic @xmath11-scattering which are all expected to be zero in perturbative qcd .",
    "no measurements of the polarized gluon distribution , @xmath12 , and of chiral odd quark distributions have been accomplished up to now .",
    "the experiment ` hera@xmath0 ' @xcite-@xcite utilising an internal polarized nucleon target in the 820  gev hera proton beam would constitute a natural extension of the studies of the nucleon spin structure in progress at desy with the hermes experiment @xcite .",
    "an internal polarized nucleon target offering unique features such as polarization above 80% and no or small dilution , can be safely operated in a proton ring at high densities up to @xmath13 atoms/@xmath14 .",
    "the estimate of the integrated luminosity which could be accumulated in the experiment is based upon realistic figures . for the average beam and target polarisation @xmath15 and @xmath16",
    "are assumed , respectively . a combined trigger and reconstruction efficiency of @xmath17",
    "is anticipated .",
    "using @xmath18 for the average hera proton beam current and a rather conservative polarized target density of @xmath19 atoms/@xmath14 the projected integrated luminosity becomes @xmath20 when for the total running time @xmath21 an equivalent of @xmath22 is assumed .",
    "this corresponds to about 3 real years under present hera conditions .",
    "one may argue , however , that at the time the experiment would run ( @xmath232005 ) even 500 @xmath24 _ per year _ might presumably become a realistic figure @xcite and the luminosity to be accumulated over the lifetime of the experiment might be considerably higher .",
    "as long as the polarized target would be used in conjunction with the unpolarized hera proton beam , the physics programme of hera-@xmath25 could be started and focused to measurements of single spin asymmetries . once having available a polarized proton beam at hera , all combinations of beam and target polarization ( @xmath26 ) could be possible and correspondingly double spin asymmetries @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 would be accessible at hera-@xmath25 .",
    "we note that single spin asymmetries might also be investigated in the polarized hera proton beam using an unpolarized gas target .",
    "this approach would have a number of advantages , e.g. : i ) unpolarized targets can deliver higher densities ( up to a limit given by the lifetime of the stored proton beam ) , ii ) the fragmentation region of the polarized nucleon lies at much smaller laboratory angles which allows to use a forward oriented spectrometer .",
    "another possibility is to get the single spin asymmetries as a by - product of the doubly polarized transverse - transverse collisions study whose importance will be shown in section 3 . generally speaking ,",
    "the physics prospects considered in the section on the single spin asymmetries are rather independent on whether beam or target is polarized .",
    "the sensitivities shown in the rest of the paper are all calculated based upon the above derived , rather conservative estimate of 240 @xmath24 for the expected luminosity .    this paper intends to present a summary of the activities undertaken so far to later propose a physics programme for an experiment with an internal polarized gas target in the ( polarized ) hera proton ring .",
    "any discussion of a possible lay - out of the experiment and its location in the hera ring is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "a study of single spin asymmetries in inclusive particle production is considered now as a way to investigate higher twist effects : there might be twist-3 dynamical contributions or hard scattering higher twists ; there might also be intrinsic @xmath30 effects , both in the quark fragmentation process and in the quark distribution functions .",
    "the contributions of the different effects are process dependent and therefore a comparative study of single spin asymmetries in different processes might be a unique way of understanding the origin and the importance of higher twist contributions in large @xmath31 inclusive production .",
    "+ there exists no consistent theoretical understanding yet of the role of higher twist contributions in single spin asymmetries .",
    "existing phenomenological models predict a size of these asymmetries ranging from a few to tens of percent .",
    "higher twist contributions should die out with increasing @xmath31 and the asymmetries should approach zero as @xmath32 .",

    ", instantons are becoming increasingly interesting as possible sources for single spin asymmetries @xcite .",
    "+ in the following we discuss the capability of hera-@xmath25 to investigate single spin asymmetries .    * inclusive pion production * @xmath33 exhibits surprisingly large single spin asymmetries at large values of @xmath34 , as it was measured a few years ago by the e704 collaboration using a transversely polarized 200  gev beam @xcite . for any kind of pions the asymmetry @xmath35 ( fig .",

    "the @xmath31 values accessible with hera-@xmath0 would be significantly larger than in all experiments performed up to now .",
    "the sensitivity @xmath46 of the asymmetry measurement in inclusive production of different particles at hera-@xmath25 was calculated using the inclusive differential cross - sections obtained with the monte - carlo program pythia  5.6 @xcite .",

    "experimentally , it is not a simple task to measure single spin asymmetries in the fragmentation region of the polarized nucleon in a fixed target experiment at 820  gev .",
    "this region lies either at very large laboratory angles ( a few tens of degrees ) if a combination of polarized target and unpolarized beam is used , or it is at very small angles ( a few mrad ) for the other combination , unpolarized target and polarized beam ( see fig .  [ sensit ] ) .",
    "the question how close to the hera proton beam particles can be measured deserves a special study . + as can be seen from fig .",

    "hence the @xmath31-range where higher twist effects are expected to be essential would be well covered .",

    "also , the asymmetry in @xmath61 meson production could be useful for a study of the strange quark polarization in a nucleon @xcite . + * inclusive direct photon production * , @xmath64 , proceeds without fragmentation , i.e. the photon carries directly the information from the hard scattering process .",
