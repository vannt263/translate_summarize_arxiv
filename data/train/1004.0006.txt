    "stable homotopy theory is essentially the study of generalized homology and cohomology theories . from its beginning in the work of spanier and whitehead on duality in the 1950 s and the work of adams , atiyah and hirzebruch , thom , quillen , and many others on vector fields , topological @xmath8-theory , and cobordism theory in the 1950 s , 1960 s , and 1970 s ,",
    "stable homotopy theory has provided powerful tools for studying questions in geometry and topology .",
    "many of algebraic topology s deepest advances and greatest successes have been tied to the development of new cohomology theories and the study of stable phenomena .    because cohomology theories involve long exact sequences , very few algebraic constructions work without severe flatness hypotheses .",
    "stable homotopy theorists therefore study a refinement ( due to boardman ) of the category of cohomology theories , called the `` stable category '' , whose objects are usually called `` spectra '' .",
    "this category has a `` smash product '' that captures multiplicative structures on cohomology theories : roughly speaking , multiplicative cohomology theories tend to be represented by `` homotopical ring spectra '' , defined in terms of monoids for the smash product .",
    "actions of homotopical ring spectra define `` homotopical module spectra '' , which represent cohomology theories that are modules over ring theories .",
    "properties of homotopical ring spectra often extend to simplify computations involving homotopical module spectra , and vice - versa .",
    "the stable category with its smash product provides a good context for stable homotopy theory , and the notions of homotopical ring and module spectra suffice for many purposes , as amply demonstrated in the literature since the 1960 s . on the other hand , as addressed by may and collaborators by the mid 1970 s and as became widely acknowledged by the mid 1980 s , certain necessary constructions require a stronger point - set foundation . for example ,",
    "homotopy ring spectra are the stable analogue of homotopy associative @xmath9-spaces rather than the analogue of topological monoids ; because of this , few of the constructions available in the stable category preserve homotopical module spectra .    the papers @xcite rewrote the foundations of stable homotopy theory , providing several categories whose homotopy categories are the stable category but which have symmetric monoidal point - set smash products ( before passing to the homotopy category ) .",
    "current terminology calls the monoids and commutative monoids for these smash products @xmath10-algebras and commutative @xmath10-algebras ; these are essentially equivalent to the older notions of @xmath1 and @xmath11 ring spectra , respectively . as a consequence of the modern foundations , for an @xmath10-algebra @xmath2 , the category of point - set left ( or right ) @xmath2-modules",
    "has an intrinsic homotopy theory .",
    "the homotopy category , usually called the `` derived category '' , shares most of the structure of the stable category and admits most of the usual constructions in homotopy theory , with the possible exception of those that require an internal smash product .    in general , for an @xmath10-algebra @xmath2 , we can form the balanced product `` @xmath5 '' of a right @xmath2-module and a left @xmath2-module as a functor from the derived categories to the stable category @xmath12 ( where @xmath3 denotes the derived category of left @xmath2-modules , @xmath13 denotes the derived category of right @xmath2-modules , and @xmath14 denotes the stable category ) .",
    "as in the case of ordinary rings in algebra , when @xmath2 is a commutative @xmath10-algebra , left and right @xmath2-modules are equivalent , and the balanced product lifts to an internal smash product @xmath15 which is a closed symmetric monoidal product . unlike the case of ordinary rings in algebra , ring spectra admit an infinite hierarchy of structures between @xmath10-algebra and commutative @xmath10-algebra , the @xmath16 hierarchy of boardman and vogt  @xcite .",
    "an @xmath0 ring spectrum is an @xmath1 ring spectrum , is equivalent to an @xmath10-algebra , and has a derived category of left modules .",
    "an @xmath11 ring spectrum is equivalent to a commutative @xmath10-algebra and its derived category has a symmetric monoidal product .",
    "this paper begins the study of the derived categories of left modules over @xmath16 ring spectra for @xmath17 .",
    "the main theorem is :    let @xmath2 be an @xmath4 ring spectrum .    1 .",
    "the derived category of left modules @xmath3 is equivalent to the derived category of right modules @xmath13 and has a closed monoidal product @xmath5 extending the balanced product .",
    "if @xmath2 is an @xmath6 ring spectrum , then @xmath5 has a braiding .",
    "if @xmath2 is an @xmath7 ring spectrum then the braiding is a symmetry , i.e. , @xmath3 is a closed symmetric monoidal category .    as one of the principle interests in constructing @xmath11 structures on ring spectra has been to have a monoidal or symmetric monoidal category of modules , for statements in the derived category , now merely an @xmath4 or @xmath7 structure suffices .",
    "for example , maria basterra and the author have shown that the brown peterson spectrum @xmath18 at each prime is an @xmath7 ring spectrum @xcite ; it is currently not known whether it is an @xmath11 ring spectrum .    to avoid a point of possible confusion , we emphasize that the derived category @xmath3 in the theorem above is the derived category of left modules for @xmath2 regarded as an @xmath1 ring spectrum , and not , for example , the derived category of operadic modules for @xmath2 regarded as an @xmath16 ring spectrum .",
    "see section  [ secoutline ] for a review of the precise definition of @xmath3 .",
    "the main theorem addresses only the question of derived categories or homotopy categories .",
    "in fact , the smash product in the homotopy category derives from a point - set level `` lax monoidal product '' @xcite or `` partial lax monoidal product '' , which we outline in section  [ secrefine ] . in lectures on this work dating back to 2004",
    ", the author has presented the following general conjecture , converse to the main theorem ( in the @xmath4 case ) :    under suitable technical hypotheses , a lax or partial lax monoidal product on a category with structure maps weak equivalences induces an @xmath4 structure on the derived endomorphism ring spectrum of the unit .",
    "the previous conjecture generalizes the deligne hochschild cohomology conjecture , which is the special case of the monoidal category of @xmath19-bimodules over a ring ( or dg ring or @xmath10-algebra ) . in this case , the derived endomorphism dg algebra ( or ring spectrum ) is the ( topological ) hochschild cohomology complex .",
    "the ( affirmed ) deligne conjecture is that this is an @xmath4 algebra @xcite .",
    "more generally , the author has advertised the problem of identifying the point - set structure on the category of modules over an @xmath16 ring spectrum ( for @xmath20 , extending the lax monoidal structure .",
    "once identified , a corresponding converse conjecture could be formulated . with the new understanding of quasi - categories that has developed in the time since the author first announced the main theorem ,",
    "the conjecture above and its generalization to @xmath16 ring spectra ( for all @xmath21 ) have become feasible to approach .",
    "the author understands that these and related problems have since been solved by clark barwick @xcite and david gepner @xcite ; see also lurie s treatment in @xcite .",
    "the author thanks maria basterra , andrew blumberg , and tony elmendorf for useful conversations and suggestions .",
    "although the constructions in this paper would presumably work in any modern ( topological ) category of spectra , for definiteness we work in the category of ekmm @xmath10-modules ; this allows us to take some technical shortcuts in several places using the fact that all objects are fibrant . for @xmath16",
    "algebras , we work exclusively with the operads @xmath22 of boardman and vogt @xcite : an element of @xmath23 consists of @xmath24 almost disjoint of the unit cube @xmath25^{n}$ ] , labelled @xmath26 , of the form @xmath27\\times \\cdots \\times [ x^{i}_{n } , y^{i}_{n}]\\ ] ] ( for @xmath28 , but generally not with equal side lengths @xmath29 : these are affinely embedded sub - cubes , rather than actual geometric sub - cubes ) .",
    "an @xmath16 algebra in this context is then an @xmath10-module @xmath2 together with an action @xmath30 satisfying the usual properties ( where @xmath31 ) . as a technical remark for those familiar with @xmath16 ring spectra in the sense of lewis and may @xcite , we note that this is precisely an @xmath16 ring spectrum @xmath2 for the operad @xmath32 such that the underlying @xmath33-spectrum of @xmath2 is an @xmath10-module ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ii.1.1 ) . the usual theory @xcite ( cf .",
    "* xii1,ii4 ) ) shows that any other sort of @xmath16 ring spectrum is equivalent to one of this type in an essentially unique way .",
    "we denote by @xmath34 the non-@xmath35 operad of little @xmath36-cubes : an element of @xmath37 is a sequence of @xmath38 almost disjoint sub - intervals of the unit interval in order .",
    "then @xmath39 , and as an operad @xmath40 ; thus , @xmath34-algebras and @xmath41-algebras coincide .",
    "we regard @xmath22-algebras as @xmath34-algebras via the usual inclusion of @xmath41 in @xmath22 ( taking a sub - interval @xmath42 $ ] to the sub - cube @xmath42\\times [ 0,1]^{n-1}$ ] ) .",
    "for an @xmath22-algebra @xmath2 , we understand a left @xmath2-module to be an operadic left module for @xmath2 regarded as an @xmath34-algebra . in other words ,",
    "a left @xmath2-module consists of an @xmath10-module @xmath43 and maps of @xmath10-modules @xmath44 for all @xmath24 , satisfying the usual associativity and unit diagrams ( as in , for example , ( * ? ? ?",

    "in fact , using the details of the little @xmath36-cubes non-@xmath35 operad @xmath34 , we give a concrete description of @xmath47 . using that description , we prove the following result on enveloping algebras .",

    "the weakened monoidal structure gives us zigzags of weak equivalences between @xmath429 and @xmath425 ( where @xmath430 may be a cofibrant approximation or similar homotopical replacement ) , and this should ( conjecturally ) induce a second ( partial and/or @xmath1 ) structure on @xmath426 that satisfies an appropriate homotopy interchange property with respect to composition . together , these can then be rectified to an @xmath4 ring spectrum structure .    in the special case of the monoidal category of bimodules over an @xmath10-algebra ,",

    "we close this paper with a brief note about the relationship between the left module enveloping algebra of an @xmath34-algebra and the moore algebra .",
    "while we can make sense of the left module enveloping algebra for an algebra over an arbitrary non-@xmath35 operad , the moore algebra construction is specific to algebras over @xmath34 : an @xmath34-algebra @xmath2 has the same relationship to its moore algebra @xmath108 as the based loop space of a topological space has to its moore loop space .",
    "we begin with the construction of the moore algebra . for this",
    ", we let @xmath433 and @xmath434 denote the positive real numbers and non - negative real numbers , respectively .",
