    "cadmium telluride ( cdte ) has found applications in a wide range of areas including but not limited to solar cells,@xcite radiation detectors,@xcite and electro - optical modulators.@xcite cdte is a prime candidate material for room - temperature radiation detectors thanks to a number of reasons : ( 1 ) its band gap lies within the range that maximizes the signal - to - noise ratio by balancing the numbers of photogenerated carriers _ vs _ thermally generated carriers .",
    "( 2 ) high purity cdte crystals exhibit a long carrier drift length , characterized by the product of carrier mobility @xmath2 and carrier trapping lifetime @xmath3.@xcite a large @xmath4 value ensures efficient charge collection and a linear response to the energy of incident radiation .",
    "( 3 ) finally , these samples possess also high resistivity @xmath5 , which is required to keep leakage currents at a minimum .",
    "further improvements can be accomplished by addition of zn to obtain @xmath0 ( czt ) alloys .",
    "the band gap gradually increases with zn concentration from 1.5 to approximately 1.6ev at @xmath6 , which leads to a further reduction of thermal noise and raises the resistivity up to @xmath7 @xmath8 cm .",
    "@xcite    zn alloying has empirically been found to have additional benefits such as oxygen gettering , increased hardness , and reduced degradation of detector performance over time from build - up of internal fields under high radiation flux ( `` polarization '' effect ) .",
    "@xcite these features have allowed the fabrication of czt gamma detectors with excellent energy resolution better than 1% at 662  kev .",
    "@xcite the large scale deployment of czt detectors is , however , hampered by high material costs .",
    "this results from the difficulty to grow large uniform single crystals , which requires cutting the ingot into individual crystallites , followed by testing and selection ( `` crystal harvesting '' ) .",
    "a variety of defects  from point defects to dislocations and secondary phases  limit the performance of the individual crystals .",
    "understanding and learning to control the different contributions is therefore key to improving the manufacturing yield and driving down cost .",
    "defects affect resistivity , charge carrier mobilities , and carrier lifetimes in different ways .",
    "the resistivity for example is largely determined by the concentrations of charged defects , which are coupled by the charge neutrality condition and can be obtained from the defect formation energies .",
    "@xcite charge carrier mobilities in turn are limited by scattering at lattice perturbations and are therefore sensitive not only to point defects and dislocations but also thermal vibrations . finally , lifetimes are shortened by carrier trapping , which occurs preferentially at defects that induce deep levels in the band gap leading to carrier recombination via the shockley - read - hall mechanism .",
    "@xcite in cdte and czt , generally lifetime - limiting defects remain the biggest challenge to maximizing device performance .",
    "these effects are modified in the case of alloys .",
    "the chemical disorder introduces a distribution of defect formation energies and electronic transition levels , and provides additional scattering channels . in this work",
    "we compute the formation energies and transition levels of native defects in czt and study their dependence on alloy composition as well the possible appearance of new defect levels in the gap . furthermore , we determine the relative importance of point defects , phonons , and alloying for carrier mobilities .",
    "this assessment is important for developing material optimization strategies .",
    "for example intentional doping and annealing can be used to modify the defect populations with little impact on phonon properties .",
    "there are approaches at different levels of sophistication for modeling the thermodynamic properties of an alloy including for example the virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) , @xcite the coherent potential approximation , @xcite special quasirandom structures , @xcite and alloy cluster expansions .",
    "@xcite here , in order to obtain a simple unified approach that allows for the study of both the distribution of defect - related thermodynamic quantities and scattering rates , we model the alloy disorder by using a set of supercells with zn atoms randomly distributed over cd sites .",
    "this approach has been applied successfully by carvalho _",
    "_ to study formation energies of cation - site intrinsic defects in czt .",
    "@xcite in the following we employ density functional theory to demonstrate from first principles that ( _ i _ ) point defect formation energies increase or stay approximately constant as a function of zn concentration , ( _ ii _ ) optical transition levels are virtually unchanged upon alloying , and ( _ iii _ ) mobilities are limited by phonon scattering at ambient conditions .",
    "the study focuses on zn concentrations up to 15% , which is the most relevant range for applications in radiation detection .",
    "the temperature dependence of the equilibrium defect concentration obeys the following relation @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the concentration of possible defect sites and @xmath11 is the gibbs free energy of defect formation , which we approximate by the formation energy @xmath12 , assuming that vibrational entropy and pressure - volume term are small.@xcite the formation energy for a defect in charge state @xmath13 is given by@xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the energies of the system with and without the defect , respectively , @xmath17 denotes the number of atoms of type @xmath18 and chemical potential @xmath19 added to the system , and @xmath20 is the electron chemical potential measured with respect to the valence band maximum ( vbm ) , @xmath21 .    neglecting entropic contributions ,",
    "the heat of formation for the czt alloy is given by @xmath22 defining @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the chemical potential of component @xmath18 in its reference state , we obtain the relation @xmath25 since @xmath26 has to be non - positive to avoid forming bulk material @xmath18 , the range of the chemical potentials is constrained by @xmath27 we then define the cation - rich limit as @xmath28 and the te - rich limit by @xmath29 ( see ref . ) .",
    "given the formation energies at @xmath30 for two different charge states , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , we compute the equilibrium electronic transition level as @xmath33      in a quasi - classical picture , the motion of free carriers subjected to a weak electric field is governed by the boltzmann transport equation.@xcite in particular , the electrical conductivity and carrier mobilities are related to scattering processes at the microscopic scale.@xcite in an alloy system , three major carrier scattering channels are active , namely those involving phonons , the inherent randomness of the alloy itself , and defects.@xcite the relative importance of these scattering channels can be assessed from first principles using fermi s golden rule @xmath34 here @xmath18 and @xmath35 denote initial and final states , respectively , and @xmath36 is the relevant scattering potential . to compare the relative importance of each scattering channel , each contribution",
    "should be treated at the same level of approximation .",
    "although highly accurate first - principles approaches have been developed to tackle each channel separately,@xcite the computational cost associated with the combinatorial explosion of point defects in an alloy currently hinders further exploration .",
    "therefore , more cost - effective approaches are desirable . in the following",
    "we present an approximate , but comprehensive , approach that forms the basis for our analysis .",
    "[ [ defect - scattering ] ] defect scattering + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    for point defect scattering , we begin with fermi s golden rule as shown in ( [ eq : scatstr ] ) .",
    "the orthogonality of the initial and final states ensures that only gradients of @xmath36 contribute to the integral .",
    "thus , we have earlier defined a simpler , but cruder , measure termed the _ relative scattering strength _",
    "by@xcite @xmath37 note that this quantity is independent of initial and final state wave functions .",
    "despite its simple form , we have shown that @xmath38 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : relscatstr ] ) is approximately proportional to the more computationally expensive brillouin - zone average over all scattering rates given by eq .  .@xcite",
    "[ [ alloy - scattering ] ] alloy scattering + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    to quantify scattering due to alloy disorder , we follow a similar procedure as for defect scattering . for a given zn concentration @xmath39",
    "we calculate the relative scattering strength using the scattering potential @xmath36 given by    @xmath40    where all terms are computed for the same supercell size and lattice constant .",
    "we then average over an ensemble of random alloy configurations for each @xmath39 .",
    "substitution of @xmath41 by the potential resulting from a vca calculation at the same concentration did not change the results .",
    "[ [ phonon - scattering ] ] phonon scattering + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    here we only consider phonon scattering in pure cdte and assume the results to transfer to the czt alloy .",
    "this is justified since the vibrational frequencies and phonon polarization vectors do not change much for small concentrations of zn in cdte . again following the perturbative approach as above , we compute the relative scattering strength of a thermal population of phonon modes by taking the difference between a thermally excited atomic configuration and the ideal zero temperature configuration .",
    "we perform the ensemble average over phonon modes by averaging over different atomic configurations representing thermally populated phonons .",
    "the configuration space was sampled in two different ways to separate harmonic and anharmonic contributions . in the first approach , cells were generated by superimposing harmonic phonons modes with random phases and amplitudes chosen to yield the correct mean square displacement for the temperature of interest . in the second approach , anharmonicity was explicitly accounted for by sampling decorrelated configurations from _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics trajectories .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) calculations were carried out in the local density approximation ( lda ) using the vienna ab - initio simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite and ultrasoft pseudopotentials .",
    "@xcite we employed supercells of 216 atoms sampled in reciprocal space with 2@xmath422@xmath422 @xmath43-point grids generated using the monkhorst - pack scheme .",
    "@xcite the plane wave energy cutoff was set to 277ev and gaussian smearing with a width of 0.1ev was used to determine the occupation numbers . for a given zn concentration we created 20 replicas of the original ideal or defective cell and",
    "randomly substituted zn for cd .",
    "the cells were subsequently relaxed until ionic forces were less than 30/ .",
    "the lattice parameters were taken from vca calculations .",
    "a homogeneous background charge was added for calculations including a charged defect to ensure charge neutrality of the entire cell .",
    "the monopole - monopole correction of makov and payne was applied to correct for the spurious interaction of charged defects.@xcite no band gap or potential alignment corrections were performed .",
    "we note that equilibrium transition levels @xmath44 are distinct from optical transition levels @xmath45 as the former determine the equilibrium electron chemical potential at which a change in the charge state occurs whereas the latter ones correspond to optical ( `` vertical '' ) transitions without the involvement of lattice relaxations . neglecting excitonic or multiplet effects we can in principle calculate optical transition levels from total energy differences of a defect in charge state @xmath13 and @xmath46 in the same geometry .",
    "thus , we need an additional separate calculation of the total energy for each relaxed defect geometry . due to the very large number of defect configurations we here instead make the additional approximation that @xmath45 may be calculated by kohn - sham eigenvalue differences for charge state @xmath13 .",
    "we note that this corresponds to the neglect of changes in the dft double counting term ( see ref . ) .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the most important defects as determined by earlier studies.@xcite these are the cd and te vacancies , te on cd antisite ( in local @xmath47 and @xmath48 symmetries ) , te - tetrahedrally coordinated cd interstitials , and the most important te - te and cd - te dumbbell split interstitials .",
    "we refer to ref .   for details of the respective geometries .",
    "the remaining lines represent the free energy of mixing up to 400  k , as generated by adding the entropy contribution for a random solution . ]    the adequacy of the supercell approach , outlined in sect . [",
    "sec : compdet ] to mimic the behavior of the ideal alloy was assessed by a study of its thermodynamic properties below the melting temperature .",
    "firstly , the zero kelvin enthalpy of mixing was obtained by fitting a second order polynomial to the lowest energy configurations for zn concentrations up to 13% , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : mixenthalpy ] .",
    "this corresponds to the enthalpy of mixing for pairwise interaction energies and a random distribution of atoms on the sub - lattices.@xcite thus , the system is completely immiscible at absolute zero .",
    "the critical temperature ( @xmath49 ) was then approximated by assuming a completely random solution , yielding @xmath50  k. in contrast , the vca ( results not shown ) erroneously predicts a miscible solution at all temperatures .",
    "the literature is unfortunately riddled with disparate estimates of @xmath49 .",
    "model calculations based on the calphad approach @xcite give 701  k , while cluster expansion calculations based on first principles energies @xcite predict 605k .",
    "experimental estimates also vary , with one careful study reporting @xmath51  k from a fit to extended x - ray absorption fine - structure characterization of phase separating alloys , but also @xmath50  k by extracting parameters from the liquid  solid phase diagram.@xcite earlier experimental studies had reported and accepted higher values for @xmath49 , but it is pointed out that slow diffusion at low temperatures makes the determination difficult by observation of phase separation , which might grossly overestimate the binodal stability temperature .     and",
    "@xmath52 , respectively .",
    "experimental values recorded at room - temperature are shown with blue symbols , see refs . .",
    "data recorded below 10k are shown with green symbols , see refs . and .",
    "the latter have been shifted by a constant to coincide with the room - temperature data . ]    in addition , we calculated the variation in band gap as a function of zn concentration and compared to experimental data , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bandgap ] .",
    "the randomized supercell approach accurately reproduces the experimental trend , while the vca exhibits incorrect bowing .",
    "in fact , even the sign of the bowing is incorrect with vca over almost the entire range .",
    "we display in fig .",
    "[ fig : eformczt_10 ] the formation energies ( lines ) and electronic transition energies ( symbols ) as a function of the electron chemical potential under te - rich conditions for the specific case of @xmath53 . to summarize ,",
    "the most dominant defects are the double acceptor @xmath54 , double donor @xmath55 , and the electrically neutral @xmath56 .",
    "in fact , the relative ordering in terms of formation energies and electronic transition levels for the different defects is unchanged with respect to cdte.@xcite however , in the case of  a few defects , most notably @xmath57 and @xmath58 , display a strong variation of formation energies and electronic transition levels between different alloy configurations ( supercells ) .",
    "this effect is highlighted in fig .",
    "[ fig : eformczt ] , where @xmath12 and @xmath44 are plotted separately for each configuration as a function of zn concentration .    in principle ,",
    "strong variations in the formation energies are a tell - tale sign of defects being sensitive to local structure variations .",
    "the impact of zn composition and alloy disorder on formation energies will now be discussed the cases of @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",

    "the zn concentration is indicated by the different symbols .",
    "red and green symbols correspond to charge states @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively . dashed line indicate separation of configurations with small ( d@xmath61 ) and large(d@xmath62 ) @xmath57-nn distances .",

    "again , symbols denote zn concentration and colors indicate small ( d@xmath61 ) and large(d@xmath62 ) @xmath57-nn distances .",
    "the line is drawn to guide the eye . ]",
    "in contrast to the anion vacancies in iii - v semiconductors , @xcite the @xmath57 defect is not subject to a jahn - teller distortion .",
    "rather , in an unrelaxed supercell containing a single neutral te vacancy , the @xmath63 defect level resides inside the band gap and is fully occupied , whereas the triply degenerate @xmath64 level is completely empty .",
    "thus no energy can be gained by breaking the @xmath47 symmetry . when allowing the ions to relax , the neighboring cd ions move symmetrically inward by a distance of 2.0    toward the vacant site for @xmath59 and outward by 3.5    for @xmath60 .",
    "the inward relaxation for @xmath59 causes the @xmath63 defect level to lower its energy and hybridize with valence band states . in  the @xmath65 geometry",
    "is virtually unchanged with respect to the defective czt , whereas the geometry of the @xmath59 state displays drastic unsymmetric variations .",
    "in particular , the nearest neighbor ( nn ) zn atoms tend to not relax inwards as the cd nns do .",
    "we however emphasize that in some configurations cd nn also display this behavior . as shown fig .",
    "[ fig : geomvte]a , this manifests itself as two two distinct average @xmath57nn distances ( d@xmath61 and d@xmath62 ) .",
    "furthermore , the unsymmetric configurations ( d@xmath62 ) , which in most cases involves a zn nn , tend to have lower formation energies .",
    "note that this effect is not observed for charge state @xmath60 .",
    "however , as the overlap of the formation energies for the two distinct groupings is appreciable , the large variation can not be correlated to the number of nn zn neighbors or local geometry alone .",
    "figure  [ fig : geomvte]b displays the variation of formation energies with respect mean square displacement @xmath66 of all atoms .",
    "it can be seen that the formation energies decrease with increasing amount of relaxation .",
    "the reduction is roughly linear for the geometries that maintain the _ local _ @xmath47 symmetry .",
    "thus we conclude that the variation in formation energies is due to atomic relaxation outside the nearest neighbor shell .",
    "this is consistent with the earlier observation that the occupied @xmath63 defect state hybridizes with extended valence band states .",
    "the analysis of the cd@xmath67 geometries is more straightforward . in cdte ,",
    "the cd@xmath68 is tetrahedrally coordinated to four te , each at a distance of 2.85  . by random substitution of cd by zn ,",
    "the formation energies spread to a range of about 0.35  ev . in fig .",
    "[ fig : geomcdi2 ] we show the formation energies as a function of average nn distance and number of next - nn zn atoms .",
    "one finds the average formation energy to generally increase with zn concentration ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : eformczt ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the large variation of formation energies is found to be strongly dependent on the number of next - nn zn atoms which also correlates with the average nn distance .",
    "-nearest neighbor distance .",
    "the symbols and colors indicate the zn concentration and the number of zn atoms in the next - nearest neighbor shell . ]",
    "the general trends for all defects studied here are clear across the concentration range of interest : the formation energies increase or stay constant as a function of zn concentration for all defects and charge states , except @xmath69 .",
    "_ examined the correlation between point defect formation energies for cation - site defects in czt and volumetrically strained cdte and concluded that in the range of @xmath70 , the volume change induced by alloying is the dominant factor in the change of formation energies.@xcite thus , they posit that accurate defect formation energies for the alloy may be predicted by performing calculations with the pure binary compound using the lattice constant of the alloy .",
    "to the benefit of this conclusion , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : eform_strain ] that usually point defect formation energies in czt and strained cdte indeed exhibit some general overall correlation .",
    "however , the absolute values of formation energies as well as their variation with volume are quantitatively rather different .",
    "in fact , the only defect showing reasonably good quantitative agreement is the cd interstitial .",
    "hence we conclude that formation energies calculated using the strained binary compound in general have small , if any , predictive power .",
    "the optical transition levels for defects with levels inside or near the band gap have been extracted from the kohn - sham band structure of the defect cell and are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : levels ] as a function of zn concentration .",
    "the black solid lines indicate optical transitions in pure cdte , and each colored line represents a defect state in a particular randomized supercell . in general , the average for each group of levels coincides roughly with the cdte result .",
    "the alloy configurations show various spreads for each defect , arising for the same reasons as the variations in the formation energies described in sect .",
    "[ sec : eform ] .",
    "furthermore , with a few exceptions ( notably , @xmath56 and ( @xmath71)@xmath72 ) , the position and spread of the transitions are fairly insensitive to zn concentration .",
    "since no new levels are introduced inside the gap ( nor do any existing levels move appreciably deeper into the gap ) from zn alloying , we conclude that the effect of defect - mediated electron - hole recombinations via the shockley - read - hall mechanism@xcite does not increase upon zn alloying .",
    "the relative carrier scattering strengths for the intrinsic defects as a function of zn concentration are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scat ] .",
    "these scattering strengths correspond to one defect in a 216-atom cell and hence correspond to a defect concentration on the order of @xmath73  @xmath74 . compared to pure cdte ,",
    "the scattering strengths are virtually unchanged and exhibit little scatter with alloy configuration .",
    "a large lattice distortion with respect to the ideal cell gives rise to scattering potentials with large gradients and hence strong scattering . in accordance , the split interstitials and te vacancies are by far the strongest carrier scattering centers .",
    "it is also quite natural to expect that scattering strengths of defects in pure cdte would serve as a lower bound since the alloy disorder could introduce more complex relaxed geometries as well as stronger scattering potentials .",
    "indeed , this is in fact observed for all defects in the present study with the exception of the neutral te vacancy .",
    "we recall , however , that the nearest neighbors of @xmath75 are subject to a large inward relaxation , unless it is a zn atom ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : eform ] ) .",
    "hence , the defect structure for the alloy is actually _ less _ distorted with respect to the ideal case when a zn atom sits next to the vacancy , explaining this apparent anomaly .",

    "[ fig : scat ] compares the relative scattering of randomized 216-atom cells with respect to the ideal structure at the same lattice constant , representing the effect of alloying . in this case",
    "the scattering strength is strongly dependent on the zn concentration and increases monotonically .",
    "as expected , the effect of alloying on carrier scattering far outweighs defect scattering for any realistic defect concentration .    ) for the most important intrinsic defects in . for each defect ,",
    "scattering strengths are shown for five different concentrations ranging from 5.5 to 13.0% ( left to right , indicated by arrow ) .",
    "the solid black lines show the relative scattering strengths for the pure cdte case .",
    "the last column ( alloy ) shows the effect of alloy scattering at the same level of approximation .",
    "the data are arbitrarily normalized to the value of the strongest intrinsic defect scattering channel . ]    the contribution to carrier scattering from phonons is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phonscat ] , comparing the results from md simulations to the harmonic approximation .",
    "the latter exhibits a linear temperature dependence whereas the md data curves upward due to anharmonic effects .",
    "the deviation between harmonic and md data points is a measure for the degree of anharmonicity , which already at room temperature amounts to 20%  of the relative scattering strength . compared to defect and alloy scattering ,",
    "these results predict that electronic transport is limited by phonon scattering for temperatures above approximately 150k .",
    "the effects of alloying on pure bulk properties , thermodynamic properties of intrinsic point defects , and carrier scattering rates were examined for czt alloys with up to 13%  zn .",
    "the defect formation energies of the most important intrinsic defects increase or remain constant with increasing zn content with the exception of the cd vacancy and to some extent the neutral te vacancy .",
    "the latter defect also deviates from the standard inward relaxation of nearest neighbor atoms in the presence of zn nns , creating a very complex and rich energy landscape as a function of zn coordination ( reminiscent of the effects of in coordination in the dilute nitride alloy gainnas@xcite ) .",
    "a previously reported relation between strained cdte and czt @xcite was revisited , revealing that the dependence of defect formation energies on zn concentration is at most qualitatively similar to the behavior deduced from volumetrically strained cdte .",
    "optical transition levels exhibit small variations with zn content and introduce no additional defect levels within the gap .",
    "thus zn alloying should not increase the defect - mediated electron - hole recombinations .    the relative carrier scattering rate concept introduced in ref .",
    "was applied here to alloy and phonon scattering as well as defect scattering .",
    "the intrinsic defect scattering in czt was shown to be very similar to pure cdte .",
    "the scattering rates in cdte were shown to serve as as lower bound for all defects except the te vacancy . the latter behavior was explained in terms of local lattice relaxation associated with the distribution of zn nns .",
    "we furthermore established the relative importance of the different scattering channels and showed that at ambient conditions and moderate defect concentrations the phonon scattering dominates the electric transport properties .",
