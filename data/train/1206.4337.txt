    "lifshitz formula  @xcite , provides a quite useful tool for the evaluation of the casimir force  @xcite between bodies with parallel planar interfaces , and rather arbitrary frequency - dependent dielectric functions . in its original version ,",
    "two disjoint media - filled half - spaces with plane , parallel boundaries were considered ; the calculation was performed at finite temperature , and the final result for the interaction force was presented in terms of the dielectric functions that described , macroscopically , the electromagnetic properties of each media .",
    "the successive refinements achieved in precision experiments measuring the casimir force have provided a continuous stimulus to generalize the scope of the lifshitz formula , in order to encompass either new or more realistic situations  @xcite .",
    "one of those generalizations has been to consider models where the fluctuating vacuum field , rather than being subject to ideal , ` sharp and strong ' boundary conditions , is instead in the presence of background potentials , localized on the mirrors  @xcite .",
    "these potentials are meant to implement smooth versions of the perfect boundary conditions .",
    "a possible way to justify them is by resorting to the microscopic point of view . indeed , by taking into account the interaction of the internal degrees of freedom on the mirrors with the fluctuating field  @xcite",
    ", one may derive an approximate effective action for the vacuum field , containing potentials with support at the positions of the material slabs . even assuming them , as we shall do throughout this paper , to have time independence and translation invariant properties along the two ` parallel ' directions , , the potentials are , in general , nonlocal functions of time ( @xmath0 ) as well as of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the non locality in can be dealt with by a fourier transformation in @xmath3 , since this yields a potential which is local in frequency as well as in the parallel components of the momentum .",
    "the resulting fourier transformed potential will still carry a dependence on the normal coordinate @xmath2 , the direction along which the effect of the potential on the fluctuating field is strongest .",
    "the potential must be , then , necessarily non invariant under translations in @xmath2 .",
    "we shall nevertheless assume that its dependence on @xmath2 is local  .    in  @xcite a qft approach",
    "was used to derive lifshitz formula for a fluctuating real scalar field coupled to two material slabs , in a situation like the previously described one regarding both the geometry involved and the simplifying assumptions made .",
    "it is the aim of this article to adapt the approach of that reference to the case of a fluctuating abelian gauge field .",
    "the derivation in  @xcite relied upon the application of the gelfand - yaglom ( g - y ) formula for functional determinants  @xcite ( for a modern review , see  @xcite ) , objects which arise quite naturally within the path integral formulation , for example , when incorporating corrections due to fluctuations , in the presence a nontrivial background .",
    "although we shall mostly deal with zero temperature calculations , it is convenient , for the sake of generality , to formulate the problem in terms of the casimir free energy per unit area , @xmath4 .",
    "this may , in turn , be obtained from the partition function @xmath5 : @xmath6 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is a length that characterizes the size of the plates .",
    "@xmath5 can be written as an euclidean functional integral : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the euclidean action for the gauge field , including its coupling to the mirrors .",
    "the integral over the time - like euclidean coordinate @xmath0 is understood to be taken over a finite interval of length @xmath10 , with periodic boundary conditions for the field .",
    "the spatial coordinates are assumed to be confined to a box of side length @xmath7 , with dirichlet boundary conditions  , shall be insensitive to the choice of boundary conditions on that spatial box . ] .",
    "since we shall be interested in the casimir force , we discard factors independent of @xmath11 , the distance between the mirrors .",
    "that is represented in ( [ eq : defe ] ) by the division by @xmath12 , which denotes the partition function when the mirrors are infinitely far apart .",
    "relevant physical observables shall be the vacuum energy per unit area , as well as the casimir force per unit area , @xmath13 : @xmath14 and its zero - temperature limit .    in this article , we derive expressions for @xmath4 as a function of the invariants that define the vacuum polarization tensor for the media on the mirrors , as well as of the ` shape ' of the mirrors , understanding by that the specific form of the @xmath2 dependence of those tensors .",
    "we do that for ( finite ) small - width mirrors and for zero - width mirrors , as an important special case of the former . in both cases we consider , we take advantage of the fact that the problem is essentially one - dimensional , and that it can be reduced to a collection of scalar problems . for them , we apply g - y theorem for its exact evaluation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : themodel ] we introduce the class of model that we shall consider , writing the partition function in terms of the physical objects that define the system : the positions and shapes of the mirrors and their vacuum polarization tensors .",
    "then in section  [ sec : reduction ] , we transform the system into two one - dimensional scalar problems .    in  [ sec : lifshitz ] , we start from the partition function and show that it can be so transformed as to be evaluated using the results of  @xcite .",
    "we then present the corresponding lifshitz formula .",
    "the casimir effect for systems involving graphene sheets has been recently studied in a series of interesting papers  ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) , including thermal effects . in section  [ sec : zerowidth ] we apply the general formula to that kind of system as a consistency check , deriving an explicit expression for cases involving graphene mirrors as a function of the parameters defining the vacuum polarization tensor . in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "throughout this article , we consider models where the em field is coupled to two imperfect mirrors modeled by ` potentials ' which are local in @xmath2 and translation invariant in @xmath3 .",
    "note , however , that those potentials , since they couple to the gauge field , will also have a tensor structure .    as in the approach of  @xcite , we define the system in terms of its euclidean action , @xmath15 . denoting by @xmath16 the abelian gauge field , that action may be written as follows : @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the free gauge field action and @xmath19 the term that accounts for the coupling to the mirrors .",
    "the former has the standard form : @xmath20 with the gauge invariant piece : @xmath21 and for the gauge - fixing term we assume the form : , with @xmath22 being a positive real constant .",
    "the interaction action @xmath23 is assumed to be composed of two terms , each one describing the interaction between @xmath16 and a mirror : @xmath24 @xmath25 ( @xmath26 , will be assumed to describe the interaction with a single mirror , whose properties are time independent as well as homogeneous and isotropic on each plane . regarding the @xmath2 direction ( normal to both mirrors ) , we assume the properties of the mirrors to be local functions of that coordinate .    besides , we use the fact that the interaction terms preserve gauge invariance .",
    "this is guaranteed , if the current due to the charged microscopic degrees of freedom which induce the coupling terms is conserved .",
    "finally , the coupling terms are assumed to be quadratic in @xmath27 , which is a reasonable assumption to make when one deals with media that may be appropriately described by linear response theory .",
    "then @xmath28 may be put into a more explicit form : using a shorthand notation for the integrations , and assuming the @xmath29 mirror to be centered at @xmath30 , we may write the term that describes its interaction with the gauge field as follows : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the vacuum polarization tensor , i.e. , the correlator between currents , for the matter fields on the @xmath29 mirror .    equation ( [ eq : defsiagen ] ) suggests the consideration of two situations , the second a particular case of the first , regarding the mirror s extent along the normal coordinate .",
    "firstly , we may regard it to have small width , in the sense that the charge carriers in the medium are strongly concentrated in a finite @xmath2 region .",
    "since there is no current along @xmath2 , the vacuum polarization tensor ( a correlator between currents ) will be zero when one or two of its indices equals @xmath33 .",
    "secondly , we shall deal with the zero - width limit of the previous case .    here , the currents are essentially planar , and we shall then neglect the action of @xmath34 on the third component of the gauge field .",
    "thus , in the small width case we shall have , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the vacuum polarization tensor for the medium confined to the @xmath29 mirror .",
    "a convention we use is that in ( [ eq : defsia ] ) , @xmath37 and @xmath10 run from @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "this implies that the mirrors shall only involve the parallel components of the electric field , @xmath40 and the normal component of the magnetic field , @xmath41 .",
    "the tensor @xmath42 , ( @xmath43 ) is assumed to be , as a function of @xmath2 , concentrated on a region centered around @xmath44 .",
    "note that we are not assuming that @xmath45 necessarily can be written as the product of a function of @xmath2 by a function of @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "for the case of very thin slabs , like the ones we shall consider when dealing with graphene - like mirrors , that factorization is a natural assumption to make .",
    "however , one could consider vacuum polarization tensors which properties depends non trivially on the normal coordinate .    performing a partial fourier transformation in ( [ eq : defsia ] ) , i.e. , just for the time and the parallel coordinates , we see that : @xmath48 here , and in what follows , we use the notation @xmath49 .",
    "we implicitly assume that the @xmath50 component is summed over discrete values , @xmath51 ( the matsubara frequencies ) at finite temperature , and integrated ( continuum values ) at zero temperature .",
    "we have thus set up the general structure of the kind of systems that we shall consider here . in the next section",
    "we show how to decompose the problem of evaluating @xmath52 for the gauge field into two independent one - dimensional systems , each one corresponding to a single real scalar field .",
    "thus each mirror has been characterized by its vacuum polarization tensor @xmath53 .",
    "it is convenient to decompose each one of them in terms of scalar functions , something that can be achieved , for example , by expanding the tensor into a complete set of orthogonal projectors . that decomposition is rather general , since it can be obtained as a consequence of the assumptions we have made .",
    "let us first note that , current conservation of the charge carriers in the media implies that , for each @xmath2 , the tensor @xmath54 is transverse , namely : @xmath55 regarding the condition above , we can find two independent solutions to the transversality condition , so that @xmath54 may be decomposed into two irreducible transverse tensors ( projectors ) , in terms of two scalars .",
    "indeed , the assumed isotropy and homogeneity of the media along the parallel directions , means that we can construct two independent transverse tensors using as building blocks the elements : @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 . note that the presence of @xmath59 is allowed since poincar invariance on the @xmath44 spacetime does not hold necessarily true .",
    "two independent projectors @xmath60 and @xmath61 that are solutions of ( [ eq : ward ] ) may be written as follows : @xmath62 and @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the transverse projector corresponding to a @xmath65 dimensional poincar covariant theory .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we also introduce the ` parallel ' projector @xmath66 : @xmath67 they satisfy the following algebraic properties : @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 where @xmath71",
    ". therefore we can express @xmath72 as follows : @xmath73 in this way , we have succeeded in characterizing the @xmath29 mirror by two functions , @xmath74 . to proceed to the reduction of the problem of evaluating @xmath5 to one - dimensional functional determinants , we shall perform the same fourier transformation we used for the interaction terms , for the free action @xmath75 . adopting the feynman ( @xmath76 ) gauge choice , @xmath77 we see that @xmath78\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    then , the complete action @xmath15 may be split into two terms , one depending on @xmath79 and the other on @xmath80 : @xmath81 with : @xmath82   \\widetilde{a}_\\beta(k_\\parallel , x_3 ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath83    note that , because of ( [ eq : actdec ] ) , and the fact that @xmath84 does not involve any coupling to the mirrors , we may write the ratio between @xmath5 and @xmath85 as follows : @xmath86 with : @xmath87    applying the properties satisfied by the projectors , we see that : @xmath88 which allows us to write : @xmath89 { \\mathcal p}^{t}_{\\alpha \\beta } \\nonumber\\\\ & + &   \\big[-\\partial_3 ^ 2 + k_\\parallel^2 +   \\sum_i f^{(i)}_l ( { k}^{2}_{0 } , \\mathbf{k}_\\parallel^{2 } , x_3 -a_i ) \\big ] { \\mathcal p}^{l}_{\\alpha \\beta } \\big\\ }   \\widetilde{a}_\\beta(k_\\parallel , x_3 ) \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] what concludes the reduction . indeed , note that the action has been reduced to a quadratic form for an operator which has been decomposed into orthogonal rank - one projectors .",
    "to obtain the lifshitz formula for this kind of model , we proceed as follows : in the path integral for @xmath90 , we may decompose the gauge field : @xmath91 @xmath92 under which the path integral measure factorizes . thus , @xmath93 where each factor is obtained as the result of performing a functional integral over one scalar degree of freedom , namely , @xmath94 where @xmath95 \\widetilde{a}^{(t , l)}_\\alpha(k_\\parallel , x_3 ) \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then we see that the free energy becomes : @xmath96 where @xmath97\\ ] ] or @xmath98 \\;\\ ] ] where : @xmath99 and : @xmath100 the system has been reduced to two independent casimir problems , each one of them corresponding to a real scalar field in the presence of its potential background @xmath101 .",
    "these potentials are built in terms of the functions that appear in the decomposition of the vacuum polarization tensor into a set of irreducible tensors .    applying the general formula derived in  @xcite ,",
    "we may write for each contribution above : @xmath102_{t , l}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath103 is the result of performing the following change of basis to the matrix @xmath104 : @xmath105 with @xmath106 and @xmath104 are defined as in  @xcite , regarding each one , @xmath107 or @xmath11 , as due to an independent field , in its own background potential .",
    "we characterize thin mirrors here as systems where the interaction between field and mirrors is confined to zero - width planes .",
    "thus , in this case , @xmath108 and @xmath109    recalling the known result of  @xcite for the case of a real scalar field in the presence of zero width mirrors , we see that : @xmath110       \\big [ 2 |k_\\parallel| + g^{(r)}_{t , l}({k}^{2}_{0 } , \\mathbf{k}_\\parallel^{2})\\big]}\\right\\}.\\ ] ]    then , the casimir force per unit area becomes : @xmath111 with @xmath112 where the arguments of @xmath113 and @xmath114 were omitted .    for a graphene sheet ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) , which can be reasonably described by a zero - width mirror",
    ", the corresponding @xmath115 functions may be read off from its vacuum polarization tensor , the result being : @xmath116 with @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the number of fermion flavours , @xmath119 the couppling constant , and @xmath120 the fermi velocity .    using these expressions into the general formula for thin mirrors ,",
    "we obtain the casimir force for cases involving either two graphene sheets or , as a limiting case , a graphene sheet and a conducting mirror .",
    "the latter may be obtained from the graphene case by setting the fermi velocity to @xmath121 and @xmath122 in one of the mirrors .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] we plot the zero temperature pressure times @xmath123 as a function of @xmath37 for the case of a perfectly conducting mirror in front of a graphene sheet , for different values of @xmath120 , and in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] for two identical graphene sheets .",
