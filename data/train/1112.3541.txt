    "such reformulation has been shown to be useful for the study of inter - particle forces in scalar theory with a nonlinear mediating field @xcite .",
    "the formal solution of ( [ 1 - 19 ] ) involves the use of the symmetric green function of that equation , and this requires a choice of gauge .",
