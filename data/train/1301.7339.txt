    "semiconductor nanowires have been emerging as a promising building block for various nano - devices .",
    "@xcite these potential applications include light emitters ,  @xcite solar cells ,  @xcite and microelectronics .",
    "@xcite all these applications require such a prerequisite that it is possible to keep the concentration of intrinsic defects and impurities in the nanowires below a given threshold so as to enable long exciton lifetimes and to avoid unintentional doping due to electrically active impurities .",
    "in recent years , many experimental efforts  @xcite have been devoted to fast and controllable growth of nanowires that is desired for reliable devices ; and a gold nanoparticle is often used as a catalyst to promote the growth of gaas nanowires .",
    "however , an au droplet that accelerates an underneath growing nanowire can also leave impurities within the gaas nanowire .",
    "@xcite previous experimental efforts have focused on characterizing au defect levels within a gaas crystal ,  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "experimental studies employing x - ray energy - dispersive spectroscopy  @xcite indicate deviations from stoichiometry in the nanowires close to the growth zone , and thus point to the abundant intrinsic defects , in addition to au impurities , in gaas nanowires .",
    "while carrier lifetimes in core - shell nanowires from au - free self - catalyzed growth @xcite were found to be much longer than in nanowires from au - catalyzed growth@xcite , they still fall short of the values reported for bulk samples by several orders of magnitude .",
    "this may indicate a higher level of growth - related intrinsic defects ( as compared to bulk ) even in au - free nanowires .",
    "the focus of our interest is the defects that could be formed in nanowire growth below the metal nanoparticle .",
    "while the most abundant defect in low - temperature grown bulk gaas is the as antisite@xcite , we expect this defect _ not _ to play a role under the more ga - rich growth conditions beneath a metal catalyst particle .",
    "it is known that near the melting point and under the conditions typical of liquid - phase epitaxy , as vacancies are the dominant defects in gaas .",
    "@xcite furthermore , under as - deficient conditions , the as lattice site might remain unoccupied ( as vacancy @xmath7 ) , it could be occupied by gallium ( ga antisite ga@xmath0 ) , or , in case of growth with a gold catalyst , may be occupied by an au atom ( au@xmath0 ) .",
    "since there is a general interest in possibly detrimental effects of au on the properties of gaas nanowires , we include au@xmath8 defects into our study .    in this context , one has to consider that the effective growth conditions for the nanowire material are probably very different from the moderately arsenic - rich conditions commonly used in gaas thin film growth .",
    "this is due to the following reasons : in nanowire growth , material deposited from the vapor phase onto the substrate , the sidewalls and the metal nanoparticle can reach the interfacial area between the nanowire tip and the particle via surface diffusion  @xcite or diffusion through the liquid metal particle .",
    "@xcite it is clear that sufficient ga atoms can reach the interfacial growth zone at the nanowire tip , since the catalyst particle actually consists of a au - ga alloy .",
    "@xcite the situation is less clear concerning the as supply , since the low - pressure solubility of as in gold is low ( in au - catalyzed growth ) , or a high high temperature leads to as loss ( in self - catalyzed growth ) . in these cases",
    ", one would expect as - deficient growth conditions at the nanowire  particle interface .",
    "one possible scenario is that additional arsenic can reach the growth zone via an as vacancy diffusion mechanism through the gaas nanowire .",
    "moreover , under as - deficient conditions , one would also expect that as vacancies could be left behind within the gaas nanowire by the advancing interfacial growth zone . a subsequent annealing process in arsenic vapor might be helpful to remove these vacancies .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand @xmath7 diffusion within gaas bulk , in order to comprehensively understand the as supply path during the growth process and to estimate a suitable annealing temperature for removing @xmath7s in a nanowire .",
    "a previous theoretical study based on density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite calculated relatively high migration barriers of @xmath9 ev for a @xmath7 in zincblende gaas .",
    "@xcite this seemingly implies that as transport through the nanowire could be inefficient .",
    "however , the convergence of the atomic - orbital basis sets employed in these dft calculations has not been demonstrated .",
    "while wurtzite gaas can not be obtained in bulk form by ordinary growth techniques , the gaas nanowires grown with au catalyst may exhibit both zincblende ( zb ) and wurtzite ( wz ) structures , or alternating segments of these ( and other ) polytypes through stacking faults.@xcite hence , it is crucial to understand @xmath7 , ga@xmath0 , and au defects in _ both _ zb and wz gaas crystals .",
    "there is considerable knowledge , both from experimental@xcite and theoretical @xcite sides , about intrinsic point defects in zb gaas .",
    "however , experimental data on point defects in wz gaas is still elusive . in this work",
    ", we will perform plane - wave dft calculations to study various properties associated with @xmath7 , ga@xmath0 , and au defects in zb and wz gaas crystals , and to investigate and compare @xmath7 diffusion in both gaas polytypes .",

    "sufficiently large supercells of 216 atoms ( zb ) or 96 atoms ( wz ) are used to fully relax the strain induced by defects and impurities .",

    "@xcite here , the migration pathway is represented by several intermediate configurations between two fully relaxed end points and each image is relaxed until the perpendicular forces with respect to the minimum energy path are less than a given tolerance , which is set to be 0.03 ev /   in our calculations .    for zb gaas ( space group f@xmath183 m )",

    "these results reflect the well - known underestimation of the electronic band gap by semi - local dft functionals , in particular , when the ( too large ) theoretical lattice constant is used .",
    "in addition , we have performed dft calculations with the same geometries as in gga , but using the hybrid functional proposed by heyd , scuseria , and ernzerhof ( hse).@xcite our calculations include 25% of the exact exchange , and the screening parameter is set to be 0.2 @xmath15 .",
    "the band gaps , that are computed to be 1.15  ev and 0.99  ev in zb and wz gaas , respectively , are much closer to experimental values .",
    "moreover , we conclude from these calculations that the valence band maximum experiences a down - shift of 0.48  ev in zb gaas ( 0.36  ev in wz gaas ) .",

    "<S> in this paper some specific issues related to point defects in gaas nanowires are addressed with the help of density functional theory calculations . </S>",
    "<S> these issues mainly arise from the growth of nanowires under conditions different from those used for thin films or bulk gaas , such as the co - existence of zincblende and wurtzite polytypes , the use of gold particles as catalyst , and the arsenic - limited growth regime . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we carry out density - functional calculations for as vacancies , ga@xmath0 antisites , and au impurities in zb and wz gaas crystals . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that as vacancies can diffuse within in a zb gaas crystal with migration barriers of @xmath11.9 ev . within wz gaas , as vacancy diffusion is found to be anisotropic , with low barriers of 1.60 up to 1.79 ev ( depending on doping conditions ) in the @xmath2-plane , while there are higher barriers of 2.07 to 2.44 ev to diffuse along the @xmath3-axis . </S>",
    "<S> the formation energy of au impurities is found to be generally much lower than those of arsenic vacancies or ga@xmath0 antisites . </S>",
    "<S> thus , au impurities will be the dominant defects formed in au - catalyzed nanowire growth . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we find that it is energetically more favorable by 1 to 2 ev for an au impurity to replace a lattice ga atom than a lattice as atom in gaas . </S>",
    "<S> an au substitutional defect for a lattice ga atom in zb gaas is found to create a charge transfer level in the lower half of the band gap . while our calculations locate this level at @xmath4 ev , taking into account the inaccuracy of the density functional that ought to be corrected by a downshift of @xmath5 by about 0.2  ev results in good agreement with the experimental result of @xmath6 ev . </S>"
