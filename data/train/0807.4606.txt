    "di - hadron correlations provide a valuable probe to study the medium created at rhic .",
    "their measurements have revealed strong suppression of back - to - back azimuthal correlation at high transverse momentum ( @xmath1 ) consistent with jet - quenching  @xcite , enhancement and strong modification at low @xmath1 suggesting strong jet - medium interactions  @xcite , and the formation of a long range correlation in pseudorapiditythe so - called ridge  @xcite .    moreover , high @xmath2 di - hadron correlation study relative to the constructed event plane ( ep ) has shown a stronger back - to - back suppression when the trigger particle is out - of - plane than in - plane  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we extend this study to finer slices in @xmath0 , the trigger particle azimuthal angle relative to ep and to lower associated @xmath3 .",
    "the 20 - 60% mid - central collisions at 200 gev are used , and are compared to the top 5% central as well as minimum bias collisions .",
    "the @xmath1 ranges of the trigger and associated particles are @xmath4 gev/@xmath5 , and their pseudorapidity range is restricted to @xmath6 .",
    "the di - hadron correlation structure sits atop a large flow background given by  @xcite    @xmath7 \\label{equation : v4background}\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the associated particle anisotropic flow , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the average anisotropy of trigger particles within slice @xmath12 . the event plane angle @xmath13 is constructed from particles outside the respective @xmath2 range used in each correlation study .",
    "we consider the flow background up to the order of @xmath14 which is about 10% of the final correlation signal .",
    "namely , @xmath15 where @xmath16 ( @xmath17=2,4 ) , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are trigger particle flow .",
    "the systematic uncertainties on our results come mainly from background subtraction which are dominated by uncertainties in the flow measurements and background normalization by @xmath20 in eq.([equation : v4background ] ) .",
    "we use the average of @xmath8 from the modified reaction plane ( @xmath21 ) and the 4-particle cumulant ( @xmath22 ) method and use the range between the two as our systematic uncertainty  @xcite .",
    "we use the parameterized @xmath23 for @xmath24 values and the error calculation . we assume zero signal in the lowest @xmath25 region of size 0.52 to obtain @xmath20 .",
    "we vary the @xmath25 size between 0.26 and 0.78 to estimate the systematic uncertainty on @xmath20 .",
    "figure [ 6slice_5x6t3 ] shows the background subtracted di - hadron correlation as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "the away - side correlation evolves dramatically from single - peak to double - peak as @xmath0 increases from in - plane ( @xmath26 ) to out - of - plane ( @xmath27 ) for most @xmath28 bins . to quantify the away - side modification , we show in fig .",
    "[ rms ] ( left ) the rms of the correlation function within @xmath29 versus @xmath0 in 20 - 60% as well as the top 5% data .",
    "the rms increases with @xmath0 ( i.e. the away - side distribution broadens with @xmath0 ) ; the effect is smaller in central collisions . for @xmath26",
    "the rms in 20 - 60% collisions is not much larger than in , while in 5% central collisions , it already shows a marked broadening from @xmath30+au .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the different pathlengths the away - side parton traverses in the reaction plane ( rp ) direction for the two centralities . on the other hand ,",
    "the rms for @xmath31 are not much different between the two , again consistent with the collision geometry the pathlengths perpendicular to rp are similar .",
    "the @xmath3 dependence of the away - side rms is shown in fig .",
    "[ rms ] ( right ) for the 20 - 60% centrality .",
    "the rms remains constant over all @xmath3 at small @xmath0 , and increases with @xmath3 at large @xmath0 .",
    "the double - peak structure is stronger when the trigger particle is further away from rp and the associated particle is harder .     and @xmath3 for @xmath32 gev/@xmath5 in 20 - 60% collisions .",
    "the @xmath33 range increases from @xmath34-@xmath35 ( left column ) to @xmath36-@xmath37 ( right column ) ; the @xmath3 range increases from 0.15 - 0.5 gev/@xmath5 ( top row ) to 2 - 3 gev/@xmath5 ( bottom row ) .",

    "[ 6slice_5x6t3 ] remains relatively unchanged , while the amplitude drops with @xmath0 and then appears to saturate for all @xmath3 .",
    "motivated by previous observations  @xcite , we separate the near - side correlation into ` jet ' and ` ridge ' by analyzing the data in two @xmath42 regions : @xmath43 where the ridge is the dominant contributor and @xmath44 where both jet and ridge contribute . the jet part is in turn obtained from the difference between the raw correlation in @xmath44 and that in @xmath43 scaled by the @xmath42 acceptance factor of approximately 1.45 .",
    "the systematic uncertainties due to background and flow are largely cancelled in the jet result because flow is measured to be independent of @xmath45 in our measured range .",
    "figure [ jetridge ] shows the jet and ridge yields in @xmath44 and @xmath46 as a function of @xmath0 for both 20 - 60% and top 5% collisions .",
    "while the jet yield remains relatively constant ( or slightly increases ) , the ridge yield decreases with @xmath0 , more significantly in the 20 - 60% centrality .",
    "the data indicate that the ridge is predominant only in the rp direction in mid - central collisions , presumably due to strong interactions between the near - side parton and the medium .",
    "the near - side jet perpendicular to rp , on the other hand , suffers minimal interaction , resulting in no significant ridge .",
    "the @xmath33 dependence of the ridge yield in the top 5% collisions is weaker , qualitatively consistent with the more spherical collision geometry in these collisions .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the ridge yields at small @xmath0 are similar between the two centralities , perhaps due to the similar surface curvature and/or gluon density in the rp direction for the two centralities .     and @xmath46 for the jet part ( red ) and the ridge part ( blue ) as a function of @xmath0 .",

    "the away - side structure in 20 - 60% collisions evolves from single- to double - peak with trigger particles from in - plane to out - of - plane , while the evolution is less significant in central collisions where the double - peak structure is evident already at small @xmath0 . at large @xmath33",
