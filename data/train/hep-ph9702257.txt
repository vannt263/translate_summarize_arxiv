    "the production mechanism of hadrons containing heavy quarks is not well understood .",
    "although the fusion reactions @xmath4 and @xmath5 are supposed to be the dominant processes , they fail to explain important features of heavy quark hadro - production like the leading particle effects observed in @xmath6 produced in @xmath7 collisions @xcite , @xmath3 production in @xmath0 interactions @xcite @xcite and in others baryons containing heavy quarks @xcite , the @xmath8 cross section at large @xmath9 observed in @xmath10 collisions @xcite , etc . + the above mentioned effects have been explained using a two - component model @xcite consisting of the parton fusion mechanism calculable in perturbative qcd plus the coalescence of intrinsic charm @xcite . + in hadron - hadron collisions the recombination of valence spectator quarks with @xmath2-quarks present in the sea of the initial hadron is a possible mechanism for charmed hadron production . here",
    "we explore that possibility for the @xmath3 s production in @xmath0 interactions .",
    "we will assume that in addition to the usual parton fusion processes , a @xmath1 diquark recombines with @xmath2-sea quark both from the incident proton .",
    "+ we compare our results with those of the intrinsic charm two - component model and the experimental data available . +",
    "in the parton fusion mechanism the @xmath12 is produced via the subprocesses @xmath13 with the subsequent fragmentation of the @xmath2 quark .",
    "the inclusive @xmath9 distribution of the @xmath12 in @xmath0 collisions is given by @xcite@xcite    @xmath14    where @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 being the parton momentum fractions , @xmath18 and @xmath19 the quark and gluon distribution in the proton , @xmath20 the energy of the produced @xmath2-quark and @xmath21 the fragmentation function .",
    "in eq . 1 , @xmath22 is the squared transverse momentum of the produced @xmath2-quark , @xmath23 is the rapidity of the @xmath24 quark and @xmath25 is the momentum fraction of the charm quark carried by the @xmath26 .",

    "in order to be consistent with the lo calculation of the elementary cross sections , we use the grv - lo parton distribution functions @xcite , allowing by a global factor @xmath35 in eq . 1 to take into account nlo contributions @xcite .",
    "+ we take @xmath36 for the @xmath2-quark mass and fix the scale of the interaction at @xmath37 @xcite .",

    "the production of leading mesons at low @xmath42 by recombination of quarks was proposed long time ago @xcite .",
    "the method introduced by das and hwa for mesons was extended by ranft @xcite to describe single particle distributions of leading baryons in @xmath0 collisions .",
    "+ in recombination models one assumes that the outgoing hadron is produced in the beam fragmentation region through the recombination of the maximun number of valence and the minimun number of sea quarks coming from the projectile according to the flavor content of the final hadron .",
    "thus , _ e.g. _ @xmath43 s produced in @xmath0 collisions are formed by the @xmath1 valence diquark and a @xmath2-quark from the sea of the incident proton .",
    "one ignores other type of contributions involving more than one sea flavor recombination .",
    "+ the invariant inclusive @xmath9 distribution for leading baryons is given by    @xmath44    where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , is the momentum fraction of the @xmath47 quark , @xmath48 is the three - quark distribution function in the incident hadron and @xmath49 @xmath50 is the three - quark recombination function .",
    "+ we use a parametrization containing explicitly the single quark distributions for the three - quark distribution function @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 normalized to one valence @xmath54 quark",
    ". the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 are constants fixed by the consistency condition @xmath57 for the valence quarks of the incoming proton as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we use the grv - lo parametrization for the single quark distributions in eq .",
    "it must be noted that since the grv - lo distributions are functions of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , then our @xmath60 also depends on @xmath59 .",
    "+ in contrast with the parton fusion calculation , in which the scale @xmath59 of the interaction is fixed at the vertices of the appropriated feynman diagrams , in recombination there is not clear way to fix the value of the parameter @xmath59 , which in this case is not properly a scale parameter and should be used to give adequately the content of the recombining quarks in the initial hadron .",
    "+ since the charm content in the proton sea increases rapidly for @xmath59 growing from @xmath61 to @xmath59 of the order of some @xmath61 s when it become approximately constant , we take @xmath62 , a conservative value , but sufficiently far from the charm threshold in order to avoid a highly depressed charm sea which surely does not represent the real charm content of the proton . at this value of @xmath59",
    "we found that the condition of eq .",
    "9 is fulfilled approximately with @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we have verified that the recombination cross section does not change appreciably at higher values of @xmath59 .",
    "+ for the three - quark recombination function for @xmath3 production we take the simple form @xcite    @xmath65    with @xmath66 fixed by the condition @xmath67 , then @xmath68 is the cross section for @xmath3 s inclusively produced in @xmath0 collisions . from eqs 7 and 8",
    ", the invariant @xmath9 distribution for @xmath69 is @xmath70 where we already integrated over @xmath71 .",
    "the parameter @xmath68 will be fixed with experimental data .",
    "+ the inclusive production cross section of the @xmath11 is obtained by adding the contribution of recombination eq .",
    "11 to the qcd processes of eq . 7 , then    @xmath72    the resulting inclusive @xmath11 production cross section @xmath73 is plotted in fig .",
    "1 using the two fragmentation function of eqs . 5 and 6 and compared with experimental data in @xmath0 collisions from the isr @xcite .",
    "as we can see , the shape of the experimental data is very well described by our model .",
    "we use a factor @xmath74 for peterson ( delta ) fragmentation respectively .    in a similar approach r. vogt _",
    "@xcite calculated the @xmath12 production in @xmath0 and @xmath10 collisions .",
    "the two component model used by them consists of a parton fusion mechanism plus coalescence of the intrinsic charm in the proton .",
    "their results are shown in fig.1 .",
    "the normalization however has been modified to make a proper comparison to our result .",
    "we have studied the @xmath3 production in @xmath0 collisions with a two component model .",
    "we show that both the intrinsic charm model and the conventional recombination of quarks can describe the shape of the @xmath9 distribution for @xmath3 s produced in @xmath0 collisions . none of them , however , can describe the abnormally high normalization of the isr data quoted in ref . @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy between theory and experiment does not exist for charmed meson production , which is well described both in shape and normalization with the parton fusion mechanisn plus intrinsic charm coalescence @xcite and with the conventional recombination as proposed here @xcite .",
    "+ an interesting test to rule out one of the two models would come from a measurement of the @xmath69 polarization as proposed in @xcite .",
