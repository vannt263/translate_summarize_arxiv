    "an electron - electron collider would be an ideal place to search for lepton - number and lepton - flavor violation .",
    "in fact , it is so unique that most of its physics can not be easily tested at other colliders , including @xmath2 and @xmath1 colliders . that is why a session in the linear collider workshop was devoted to @xmath0 physics , including both accelerator technology talks and physics talks . in this report",
    ", i summarize the talks on both aspects .",
    "the first major concern is the luminosity of the @xmath0 option compared to the @xmath1 mode .",
    "wood and raubenheimer @xcite performed luminosity comparison for both nlc and tesla designs due to the effects of wakefields , disruption , and kink instability .",
    "they found that the @xmath0 option for both designs suffers more serious luminosity loss than the @xmath1 by a factor of about 10 , but is recoverable to some extent with the use of beam - based feedbacks .",
    "markiewicz @xcite studied the ir layout , in particular the pair - induced backgrounds . in @xmath1 collisions , both neutron and charged particle backgrounds",
    "are dominated by beam - beam pairs .",
    "the factor of a few decrease in luminosity in @xmath0 option also reduces the number of beam - beam pairs by the same factor .",
    "therefore , although the @xmath0 option suffers luminosity loss , the beam - beam pair backgrounds however is less than the @xmath1 mode .    another important issue of the @xmath0 option is the switchover in the linac , i.e. , how easy or how automatic should one expect for switching from @xmath1 to @xmath0 and vice versa .",
    "the goal is to obtain an optimally functional and cost effective model for achieving the @xmath0 mode .",
    "the requirements include : ( i ) quick switch , ( ii ) the switchover should cause a minimal perturbation to the running condition for @xmath1 mode , ( iii ) automated means to do the switchover job .",
    "larsen @xcite proposed three models for switchover .",
    "the first one is _",
    "polarity reversal model_. just by the name it reverses the polarity of the magnets so that the electron and the positron can be accelerated in the same path .",
    "the second is _ direction reversal model _ , which makes the electron to accelerate in the opposite direction as the positron .",
    "the third is _ independent system model _ , i.e. , separate beam path for positron and electron , which is of course the most expensive",
    ".    overall , there are quite a few issues involving in the @xmath0 option .",
    "however , if one plans ahead and includes the consideration for @xmath0 when they design the whole linear collider , the extra cost should only be a small fraction of the total .",
    "the physics paid - off would be far more than the cost if we plan well in advance .",
    "there were talks given by heusch @xcite , gunion @xcite , and cannoni @xcite .",
    "i briefly summarize their presentations .",
    "readers can find some nice reviews on the physics potential of @xmath0 colliders in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since both electron beams can be polarized to very high purity , one can measure the polarized cross sections , and then determine the left - right cross section asymmetries and the weinberg angle to very high accuracy @xcite .",
    "one can define the following asymmetries @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the cross section for @xmath5 .",
    "assuming dominance by @xmath6 and @xmath7 exchanges , in the limit @xmath8 , the above asymmetries can be written as @xmath9 by measuring the polarized cross sections the asymmetries @xmath10 can be determined and so can @xmath11 to high accuracy : @xmath12 at @xmath13 tev and @xmath14 fb@xmath15 luminosity .",
    "one can also make use of the @xmath16 dependence on @xmath17 to determine the @xmath16 dependence of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "certain types of new physics can be directly tested at @xmath0 colliders , in particular those involving lepton - number violating interactions .",
    "one unique new physics of @xmath0 colliders is to search for any doubly charged particle that has at least a weak coupling to electrons .",
    "typical examples include doubly - charged higgs bosons of some triplet higgs or more complicated representations @xcite , bilepton gauge bosons that exist in some 3 - 3 - 1 models @xcite , and little higgs models @xcite . in frampton s 3 - 3 - 1 model , the bilepton gauge boson couples to the lepton triplet @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the new gauge boson .",
    "@xmath20 can be produced as an @xmath21-channel resonance at @xmath0 collisions , and then decay into @xmath22 .",
    "it is background free and @xmath20 appears as a clean resonance . in the case of higgs - triplet or higher higgs representations ,",
    "as long as the vev of the neutral component is small enough , it will not affect the electroweak symmetry breaking and @xmath23 is preserved .",
    "in fact , triplets are desirable in a number of neutrino mass models .",
    "recently , a new class of models , called little higgs , were advocated to delay the gauge hierarchy problem to 10 tev scale . in these models ,",
    "e.g. , the littlest higgs model @xcite , there often exists a higgs triplet field @xmath24 , which is needed to cancel the divergence associated with the scalar - boson loop of the higgs boson mass .",
    "the higgs triplet has @xmath25 , which couples to @xmath0 with a lepton - number violating coupling @xmath26 .",
    "one would expect @xmath27 for lepton flavor violation",
    ". however , this coupling is related by su(2 ) invariance to @xmath28 , which gives a majorana mass to left - handed neutrinos .",
    "therefore , @xmath29 is constrained to be very small .",
    "another possibility is that @xmath30 develops a vev @xmath31 such that it couples to @xmath32 and @xmath33 . through this vev",
    ", @xmath34 can be produced via @xmath35 .",
    "however , it is well known that precision electroweak measurements require @xmath31 to be small @xcite .",
    "preliminary estimates showed that backgrounds are too large to observe such a resonance .    .",
    "[ fig1],width=192 ]    one of the lepton - number violating reactions is the inverse of neutrinoless double beta decay , via a @xmath36-channel exchange of a majorana neutrino , shown in fig .",
    "the rate of the process is proportional to the square of the majorana neutrino mass @xmath37 .",
    "the question is how low the mass the collider can probe .",
    "another interesting process is the @xmath38 , via a @xmath36-channel neutralino exchange @xcite .",
    "the differential cross section of the process is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the weinberg angle and @xmath41 is the bino mass .",
    "the cross section scales as @xmath42 , the measurement of which can determine the soft parameter @xmath41 quite precisely .",
    "in addition , the cross section versus @xmath43 is a sensitive function of @xmath44 ; in particular @xmath45 has a @xmath46-wave turn - on such that it provides an excellent measure of the mass of @xmath47 at the threshold @xcite .",
    "another related process is the slepton flavor oscillation @xcite .",
    "the word `` oscillation '' might be a little bit misleading .",
    "it is essentially a slepton flavor mixing that will give rise to observable lepton flavor violation . in general , the matrix that diagonalizes the lepton flavors may not diagonalize the slepton flavors , and so we could have the following slepton mass matrix , supposed we only care the first and second generations , @xmath48 in which the off - diagonal entry @xmath49 could be of the same order as the diagonal elements . in this case",
    ", there will be near - maximal mixing between selectron and smuon .",
    "then the following process becomes possible @xmath50 which has one electron and one muon plus missing energies in the final state .",
    "the same final state could also go through @xmath51 , followed by @xmath52 decay .    yet ,",
    "another related process , though in an entirely different framework , is production of a pair of kaluza - klein electrons .",
    "it is in the framework of universal extra dimensions , in which all sm particles are allowed to propagate in extra dimensions . in this model",
    ", there exists a kk parity assigned for each sm particle and kk state such that the parity is odd for odd @xmath53 and even otherwise ( sm particles are even ) .",
    "the lightest kk state @xmath54 with a negative kk parity is therefore stable .",
    "in fact , it could be a potential dark matter candidate .",
    "the relevant process at @xmath0 colliders is @xmath55 via a @xmath36-channel @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the kk electron pair will then decay into a pair of electrons and kk photons .",
    "thus , the signature is two soft electrons plus a large missing energy .",
    "it is unique and free from @xmath56 background .",
    "so far we have only discussed tree - level lepton - flavor violation , cannoni reported a work on loop - level lepton number and flavor violation @xcite in models of tev majorana neutrino and in the supersymmetric extension of the sm .",
    "the heavy majorana neutrino contributes to the lepton flavor violating process @xmath57 through box diagrams @xcite .",
    "for majorana neutrino masses @xmath58",
    "tev the signal cross section can reach the level of @xmath59 and @xmath60 fb for @xmath61 and @xmath62 channels , respectively .",
    "the cross section may be too small for discovery unless the luminosity is of order 1000 fb@xmath15 .",
    "in the general supersymmetric standard model ( ssm ) , the squark and slepton mass matrices are in general non - diagonal .",
    "the off - diagonal matrix elements have to be under control in order to satisfy the flavor constraints .",
    "one usually has to adopt universal boundary conditions .",
    "however , when the seesaw mechanism is embedded in the ssm , a new source of lepton - flavor violation arises .",
    "the seesaw requires three singlet neutrinos at the seesaw scale @xmath63 with additional yukawa couplings to lepton fields : @xmath64 .",
    "the rge running from the gut scale down to @xmath63 induces off - diagonal matrix elements in @xmath65 given by @xcite @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the common scalar mass and @xmath68 is related to @xmath69 .",
    "it in turn induces lepton flavor violation .",
    "_ considered the process @xmath70 involving sleptons and gauginos in box diagrams .",
    "in general the cross section is very small , sub - fb level , but the signature is rather striking : a muon or a tau with an electron back - to - back in the final state .",
    "we can also study the strong @xmath32 scattering at @xmath0 colliders , in particular the @xmath71 mode , which has an isospin @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath0 collisions provide a unique setting for testing the isospin @xmath72 channel .",
    "a study was performed about 10 years ago before the precision measurements prefer a light higgs boson . at any rates",
    "one should always bear in mind that we always prepare for the surprise .",
    "so here i quote the table showing the event numbers @xcite .",
    ".[table1 ] cross sections ( fb ) for various strong @xmath32 scattering models in @xmath73 at @xmath74  tev with optimized cuts .",
    "those in parentheses correspond to the # of events with hadronic @xmath75 decays for an integrated luminosity of 300 fb@xmath15 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     finally , the @xmath0 option has unique physics potential , and the cost for it is minimal if the linear collider project includes it as early as possible .",
    "this research was supported in part by the national science council of taiwan r.o.c . under grant",
