    "to enhance the performance of micromegas detectors , it is necessary to match the granularity of the readout to the highly granular gas amplification stage . taking into account the rising number of readout channels per area when",
    "following this approach , a pad based readout is impractical .",
    "this drawback can be bypassed by using integrated electronics in form of a pixel chip , e.g. the timepix asic  @xcite .",
    "this pixel chip offers @xmath5 pixels with a pixel pitch of @xmath6 and thus an active area of @xmath7 .",
    "each of the pixels contains a charge sensitive amplifier and a discriminator plus complete counting logic needed for time or charge measurements .    in order to achieve a precise alignment between the mesh holes and the pixels , to avoid the appearance of moir patterns",
    ", it is suitable to produce the micromegas mesh directly on top of the pixel chip by means of photolithographic postproceesing technologies  @xcite .",
    "a scanning electron microscope picture of the resulting structure can be seen in figure  [ subfig : ingrid ] . when building such an * * in**tegrated * grid * on top of a timepix asic a resistive layer made of @xmath8 silicon nitride is deposited between asic and ingrid to protect the chip and its electronics from discharges occurring during operation of the micromegas stage  @xcite .",
    "the ingrid based x - ray detector constructed at bonn uses a timepix asic with an ingrid stage as central charge multiplication and readout device .",
    "the design of the detector ( see figure  [ subfig : detector - ex ] for an exploded view ) has been based on the recent micromegas detectors  @xcite used at the sunset stations of the * * c**ern * * a**xion * * s**olar * * t**elescope  @xcite .",
    "the detector body is made of acrylic glass and contains the modular readout assembly which houses the timepix asic , with the ingrid stage , mounted on a small carrier board .",
    "the chip is covered by a field shaping electrode , closing the readout assembly .",
    "the electrode features a cutout matching the size of the chip s active area and is leveled a bit above the mesh of the ingrid structure and set to the electric potential according to its position within the drift field .",
    "this helps to reduce electric field distortions arising at the chip s borders and the wire bonds connecting the chip s electronics to the underlying carrier board .",
    "the drift volume featuring a drift distance of @xmath9 at a drift field of @xmath10{500}{\\volt\\per\\centi\\metre}$ ] is closed by a cathode plate made of copper . to allow especially low energy x - ray photons to enter the detector ,",
    "a @xmath11 thick aluminized mylar film is used as entrance window .",
    "the material of the cathode plate above the instrumented area of the detector has therefore been removed except for a small grid like structure to support the thin window .",
    "the support for the window is necessary as it has to withstand a pressure difference of @xmath12 .",
    "additionally only a small leak rate is allowed so the detector can be operated connected to vacuum .",
    "considering these requirements the choice of a @xmath11 mylar film represents a good compromise between robustness and transparency .",
    "readout of the timepix asic is done with an fpga based readout system developed at bonn  @xcite which allows for full access to firm- and software for customization .",
    "the detector is filled with a gas mixture composed of @xmath13 argon and @xmath14 isobutane as quencher gas .",
    "the detection of x - rays with this detector is based on the fact that x - rays entering the detector will hit a gas atom and produce a bunch of primary electrons through ionization .",
    "these will drift towards the readout .",
    "the initial bunch of electrons is spread to a cloud of approximately circular shape due to diffusion",
    ". then they get multiplied in the ingrid stage and are afterwards detected on the timepix s pixels .",
    "this allows for a low x - ray energy threshold along with a topological background suppression by application of an event shape analysis .",
    "a typical x - ray event recorded with the detector is depicted in figure  [ subfig : sampleevent ] .",
    "to replace the pnccd detector behind the x - ray telescope  @xcite at one of the four detector stations of cast , a vacuum system has been constructed and built which allows for differential pumping and provides the necessary safety interlocks . for the differential pumping a @xmath15 thick mylar window",
    "is used . in april and may of 2014 the vacuum system and the ingrid based detector were installed including a laser guided alignment with the x - ray telescope . a lead shielding designed and manufactured by our colleagues from the university of zaragoza was added mid of may . in two months of operation",
    "no detector related problems occurred .",
    "prior to the installation , the detector was characterized at the x - ray generator of the cast detector lab which provides a complete vacuum beamline connected to the x - ray generator  @xcite . with the appropriate combination of targets of the x - ray tube and filters , characteristic x - ray lines",
    "can be produced in the energy range from a few hundred @xmath16 up to @xmath17 .",
    "additionally the lab provides the necessary infrastructure for operating micromegas detectors .",
    "the lab tests underlined the detector s low energy threshold through successful detection of photons down to the carbon k@xmath18 line at @xmath1 ( see figure  [ subfig : c - spectrum ] for the spectrum containing the carbon k@xmath18 line ) .    to achieve a low background rate a background discrimination routine was created , based on a likelihood algorithm and reference data sets for different energy ranges recorded during the tests in the cast detector lab .",
    "the applied likelihood method utilizes event shape properties making benefit of the timepix asic s high spatial resolution resulting in a topological background suppression to identify real x - ray photons in the recorded data .",
    "the energy of a recorded event is calculated via a calibration curve from the total charge of an event . to built the likelihood , event shape properties of this event",
    "are being compared to the corresponding distributions for events of similar energy .",
    "these sample distributions are obtained from the lab tests data .",
    "the likelihood cut value is adjusted for each energy range so that a signal efficiency of roughly @xmath19 is kept over all energies .",
    "the background rates achieved during first operation period were in the order of a few @xmath2{e-5}{\\per\\kev\\per\\centi\\metre\\squared\\per\\second}$ ] , occurring peaks could be explained by the characteristic fluorescence line of the copper cathode and misidentified cosmic rays traversing the detector perpendicular to the chip and therefore resulting in an x - ray like , circular , structure .",
    "a gaseous detector based on the combination of a pixel chip and an integrated micromegas stage has been successfully built and commissioned .",
    "the detector was installed at the cast experiment along with its infrastructure and has up to now been successfully operated .",
    "first background rates achieved in the cast environment look promising and are in agreement with the results obtained with a first prototype in the lab at bonn  @xcite . together with the measurements carried out at an x - ray generator facility which provided proof of the detector s low energy detection threshold of a few hundred @xmath16 , the detector s performance could be underlined and demonstrated .    further improvement to the background discrimination algorithm will be done as well as future detector upgrades , which should include a decoupling and recording of the signal induced on the mesh , as it is done for the cast micromegas detectors .",
    "the latter one should give access to further event properties to be utilized for background suppression .",
