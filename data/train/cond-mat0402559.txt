    "quantum effects in mesoscopic superconducting circuits of small josephson junctions have attracted renewed attention .",
    "it was clearly demonstrated that josephson devices can behave like single microscopic particles if they are sufficiently isolated from the environment .",
    "therefore , ideas developed in atomic and molecular physics can be used for description of artificially fabricated circuits of macroscopic size .",
    "these concepts are stimulated further by the perspectives of a promising way to realize quantum bits ( qubits ) for quantum information processing .",
    "qubits are two - level quantum systems with externally controlled parameters .",
    "generally , two kinds of such devices with small - size josephson junctions have been developed .",
    "one approach is based on charge degree of freedom , basis states of this kind of qubits are distinguished by the number of cooper - pairs on a specially designed island .",
    "the alternative realization utilizes the phase of a josephson junction ( or the flux in a ring geometry ) , which is conjugate to the charge degree of freedom . due to macroscopic size of superconducting qubits , they are extremely sensitive to external disturbances",
    ". thus , a backaction of a detector should be as small as possible .",
    "a lot of different detectors have been suggested in literature ( see ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "in this paper we review our results obtained on superconducting qubits by the impedance measurement technique ( imt ) .",
    "below we shall discuss several quantum effects including macroscopic quantum tunneling , landau - zener transitions , rabi oscillations , and direct resonant spectroscopy of the qubit energy levels .",
    "finally , we present our very recent results of investigation of two coupled qubits .",
    "for the flux qubits the josephson energy dominates over the charge energy , @xmath0 .",
    "it was predicted , that such systems should exhibit various quantum - mechanical effects including macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) of the flux .",
    "@xcite indeed , predicted effects had been observed experimentally .",
    "@xcite in this section we briefly discuss the main properties of the flux qubits and demonstrate that the imt technique is a powerful tool for the investigation of the mqt .",
    "one of the realizations of the flux qubit is a superconducting loop with low inductance @xmath1 , including three josephson junctions ( a 3jj qubit ) .",
    "@xcite its total josephson energy is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the phase difference and josephson energy of the @xmath5th junction , respectively . due to flux quantization ,",
    "only @xmath6 are independent with @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the flux quantum ) for negligibly small  @xmath1 ( though see @xcite ) .    at @xmath9 ,",
    "the potential @xmath10 has two shallow minima .",
    "these two minima correspond to the qubit states @xmath11 and @xmath12 , carrying opposite but equal supercurrents around the loop .",
    "therefore , according to the laws of quantum mechanics , near degeneracy the system can tunnel between the two potential minima .    in the basis @xmath13 and near @xmath9",
    ", the flux qubit can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath14 at bias @xmath15 , the two lowest levels of the qubit anticross ( fig .",

    ", the qubit can either adiabatically transform from @xmath11 to @xmath12 staying in the ground state @xmath18 or switch to the excited state  @xmath19 .",
    "the probability of the latter ( called landau - zener transition ) for linear sweep @xmath20 and @xmath17 changing from @xmath21 to @xmath22 was calculated  @xcite to be @xmath23 .     with left - rotating supercurrent .",
    "as @xmath24 is increased , these lose classical stability in favour of the corresponding states @xmath25 , denoted by d , e , and f. ( b )  internal vs external qubit flux.,width=306 ]    in order to demonstrate the principle of the imt measurements of this system , let us consider the internal flux representation ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) instead of the energy one ( fig .  [ fig1]a ) .",
    "a similar picture is usually used for the explanation of the operation of the conventional radio - frequency ( rf ) squid .",
    "the main difference between an rf squid and a qubit behavior is the existence of the adiabatic trajectory @xmath26 for latter one ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]a , b ) .",
    "let us assume that @xmath26 trajectory is forbidden and `` qubit '' is inductively coupled to the high - quality resonant circuit .",
    "then the system exhibits hysteretic behavior .",
    "@xcite the tank circuit is simultaneously driven by a dc bias current @xmath27 and an ac current @xmath28 of a frequency @xmath29 close to the resonance frequency of the tank circuit .",
    "both currents produce the total magnetic flux applied to the qubit @xmath30 . if the amplitude @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the half - width of the hysteresis loop @xmath33 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) , the tank circuit will register the energy losses proportional to the loop area , as long as @xmath34 .",
    "these losses occur due to the jumps from @xmath19 to @xmath18 at the ends of the loop .",
    "this idea was used by a. silver and j. zimmerman to build the first rf squid magnetometers .",
    "@xcite if @xmath31 the rf voltage across the tank circuit is a @xmath35-periodical function of applied dc flux @xmath36 with local minima at @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is integer .",
    "now , let us take into account the additional `` quantum '' trajectory @xmath26 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) . if its probability @xmath39 is nonzero but less than @xmath40 , two new closed paths @xmath41 and @xmath42 are possible .",
    "there are two contributing trajectories , adiabatic and landau - zener transition .",
    "therefore the net dissipation is @xmath43 and vanishes if @xmath44 is either too small or too large @xcite . due to the exponential dependence of @xmath44 on the sweep rate , in practice",
    "this makes the @xmath45 losses observable only if the bias sweep narrowly overshoots the anticrossing , i.e. , if @xmath46 when @xmath24 changes slowly .",
    "plotting @xmath36 for @xmath47 , a plateau flanked by two peaks is expected .",
    "the position of the dips depends on @xmath48 as follows from eq .",
    "[ eq : dipcond ] .",
    "therefore in contrast to @xmath49 dependence of an rf squid the qubit should exhibit two local minima ( in one period ) which are symmetrical with respect to @xmath50 .",
    "for the amplitude @xmath31 the @xmath33 hysteresis becomes closed as well . here ,",
    "similar to the rf squid , on the @xmath51 dependence should appear the local minimum exactly at @xmath50 .",

    "now assume that the probability of a landau - zener transition is small and the qubit adiabatically changes from @xmath11 to @xmath12 , always staying in the ground state  @xmath18 .",
    "this means that the hysteresis @xmath33 is `` shunted '' by the @xmath26 trajectory .",
    "therefore there are no losses caused by the flux jumps in the qubit . however , in the vicinity of @xmath68 ( see fig .",

    "these peaks disappear when the phase bias is far from @xmath233 as well as at higher temperatures .",
    "therefore , we believe , that they correspond to the excitation of the system from the ground to the upper state .    the microwave induced transition ( both the frequency of the microwave and the phase difference across the transistor @xmath234 are fixed ) from the ground to the upper state occurs only at certain value of the gate charge . from the position of the peaks on the @xmath232 curves at different frequencies of the microwave , we have reconstructed the energy difference between ground and upper states as a function of the quasicharge on the island .",

    "this value of the josephson coupling energy is in very good agreement with the estimated value , and , as expected , the charging energy is smaller than estimated .",
    "after the successful demonstration of quantum coherence in many types of superconducting qubits an observation of entangled states in two coupled qubits presents the next step on the road to the quantum processor .",
    "the entangled states were recently observed in both the charge  @xcite and the current - biased josephson junction  @xcite qubits . in this section",
    "we demonstrate that entangled states in a system of two inductively coupled flux qubits  @xcite can be detected by the imt .",

    "the mutual inductance between the qubits @xmath241  ph was estimated numerically from the electron micrograph .",
    "the magnetic flux through the qubits was created by the dc component of the current in the coil @xmath242 and by the bias current @xmath243 through a wire close to one of the qubits .",
    "this allowed independent control of the bias in each qubit .        the system of fig .",

    "the qubit biases are given by @xmath256 , @xmath257 , where the dimensionless flux @xmath258 describes the field created by the niobium coil in both qubits , while the parameters @xmath259 and @xmath260 give the bias difference between the qubits created by the additional wire . here",

    "the qubit ",
    "qubit coupling constant @xmath266 is positive because the two qubits are in the same plane side to side , leading to antiferromagnetic coupling ( according to the north - to - south attraction law ) .    the application of the imt for spectroscopy of two coupled qubits , similar to single - qubit problem ( see section ii ) , can be conveniently discussed in terms of their magnetic susceptibility @xmath267 . in the linear - response approximation the magnetic susceptibility of the two - qubit system @xmath268 is expressed through retarded green s functions of the qubit operators @xmath269 , calculated with the equilibrium density matrix @xmath270 with @xmath271 as in eq .",

    "comparison of the single - qubit dips with the coincident imt dip shows clearly that the contribution to @xmath287 from the entangled eigenstates is significant .",
    "indeed , the amplitude of the central dip in fig .  [ fig10 ] at @xmath288  mk is 1.12 , compared to the sum of the single - qubit dips equal to 1.69 .",
    "it means that the entangled terms ( second and third lines in eq .",
    "( [ eq_tan_theta_r ] ) ) are responsible for the negative contribution @xmath289 to @xmath284 .    at 50",
    "mk the temperature is comparable to the characteristic energies in the two - qubit system ( at the two - qubit degeneracy point the gap between the ground state and top excited state is @xmath290  mk ) .",
    "since the characteristic measurement time in our approach is dictated by the much smaller tank frequency , @xmath173 , the system will have time to equilibrate .",
    "indeed , an excellent quantitative agreement between the experiment ( fig .  [ fig10 ] ) and the theory eq .",
    "( [ eq_tan_theta ] ) confirms that the system is described by the equilibrium density matrix with the hamiltonian eq .",
