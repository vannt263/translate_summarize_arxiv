    "optimal design of experiments is an approach to constructing experimental designs using a statistically motivated utility function called an optimality criterion , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "construction of an optimal experimental design is generally a challenging problem of theoretical mathematics and numerical optimization . in this paper",
    ", we propose a unifying view on various experimental design restrictions encountered in practice , which we formalize by the notion of `` resource constraints '' .",
    "we show that efficient designs under any system of resource constraints can be constructed by a single heuristic method .",
    "suppose that we intend to perform an experiment consisting of a set of trials ( runs , measurements ) .",
    "for each trial , we must select a design point from a finite design space @xmath1 representing permissible experimental conditions .",
    "we assume that in general it is possible to select the same design point for more than one trial .    for each @xmath2 ,",
    "let @xmath3 be the index of @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath5 is a one - to - one mapping from @xmath1 to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the size of @xmath1 . in this setting , an `` exact '' experimental design can be represented by a vector @xmath8 with components @xmath9 determining the numbers of independently replicated trials in the design points @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "a vector @xmath11 with general non - negative components will be called an `` approximate '' experimental design , and viewed as a relaxation of an exact design .",
    "the reason is that in the problems with multiple resource constraints the number of trials ( i.e. , the normalization constant ) is not known in advance . ] .",
    "the following toy example motivated by question 2.2 in @xcite will be used to illustrate the basic definitions .",
    "[ example ] an engineer wants to protect metal plates against corrosion .",
    "there is a new paint for the plates .",
    "the engineer decides to estimate the protective effect of one and two coats of the new paint .",
    "he will paint some metal plates once , some twice , and then immerse them all in a tank of water . later he will remove all the plates , and measure the degree of corrosion of each . in this situation ,",
    "the design space is @xmath12 with a natural indexing @xmath13 .",
    "an exact experimental design is any vector @xmath14 , where @xmath15 means the number of metal plates painted with one coat and @xmath16 means the number of metal plates painted with two coats .",
    "an approximate experimental design is any two - dimensional vector with non - negative components .",
    "let @xmath17 be an optimality criterion that measures the quality of ( exact or approximate ) designs for statistical inference .",
    "often , the goal of the experimenter is to estimate unknown parameters of an underlying statistical model , and the value @xmath18 is a measure of the information about the parameters of interest obtained from the experiment @xmath19 , see , e.g. , chapter 5 in @xcite . in view of this interpretation , it is natural to adopt the following assumption of monotonicity :    * augmentation ( extension ) of an experiment by additional trials can not decrease its quality for statistical inference , i.e. , if designs @xmath19 and @xmath20 satisfy @xmath21 componentwise , then @xmath22 .",
    "the most classical example of @xmath23 is the criterion of @xmath0-optimality for linear regression models with independent homoscedastic errors , as we will briefly describe .",
    "consider an experiment with an @xmath7-point design space @xmath1 .",
    "assume that for each trial in the design point @xmath2 , the real - valued random observation @xmath24 satisfies @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a `` regressor '' vector , @xmath28 is the index of @xmath4 , @xmath29 is a vector of unknown parameters of interest , and @xmath30 is a constant variance . for different trials ,",
    "the observations are assumed to be independent .",
    "then , the criterion of @xmath0-optimality @xmath31 is defined by @xmath32^{1/m}.\\ ] ] it is possible to show that @xmath33 is continuous , concave and monotonic on @xmath34 in the sense of assumption ( m ) ; see , e.g. , chapter 5 and section 6.2 in @xcite .",
    "additionally , @xmath33 is homogeneous , that is , @xmath35 for any design @xmath19 and any @xmath36 .",
    "hence , the quality of two designs can be compared by their relative @xmath0-efficiency defined by @xmath37 for all @xmath19 and @xmath20 such that @xmath38 .",
    "a design @xmath39 is called @xmath0-optimal , if it maximizes the value of @xmath33 in a given set @xmath40 of competing designs . from the statistical point of view , the @xmath0-optimal design minimizes the generalized variance of the best linear unbiased estimator of @xmath41 or , in the case of normal observations , a confidence ellipsoid for @xmath41 . for details , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "a possible model for observations in @xmath2 ( that is , for measurements of the degree of corrosion ) is @xmath25 , @xmath26 . here ,",
    "@xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , i.e. , @xmath45 is the mean value of the degree of corrosion with one coat and @xmath46 is the mean value of the degree of corrosion with two coats . for a design",
    "@xmath14 the value of the @xmath0-criterion is @xmath47 .",
    "usually , the set of designs is only restricted by the number of trials , i.e. , @xmath48 for each feasible exact design @xmath19 , where @xmath49 is a maximum `` size '' of the experiment . ,",
    "but assumption ( m ) implies that this requirement is equivalent to . ]",
    "this corresponds to the situation where each trial amounts to the same cost and the experimental budget allows performing at most @xmath49 trials .",
    "alternatively , condition can represent the requirement that the trials must be performed sequentially , each trial lasts the same amount of time , and the deadline permits performing at most @xmath49 trials . however , there are practical situations where any feasible design must satisfy one or more constraints different from .    in our example",
    ", a natural restriction is that the number of available metal plates is @xmath49 , that is , we can select only designs @xmath19 that satisfy @xmath50 .",
    "however , even in this extremely simple case , there might be some additional constraints .",
    "for instance , it is possible that the total available amount of the paint is limited by @xmath51 units and one coat of the paint consumes @xmath52 units . in this case",
    ", we must add a second restriction @xmath53 on feasible experimental designs @xmath19 .",
    "the study of experimental designs under multiple constraints is an important part of optimal design theory , see , for instance , the review paper @xcite or chapter 4 in @xcite .",
    "generally , the constrained design problems are difficult , especially for a large design space . for instance , even in the case of a linear system of constraints , mere finding a single feasible exact design ( or proving that there is no such design ) may be a highly non - trivial task . in this paper",
    ", we introduce a class of constraints that do not comprise all linear constraints on designs , yet they are broad enough to encompass many practical experimental design restrictions and , at the same time , lead to a relatively simple set of feasible exact experimental designs .",
    "we propose to consider general `` resource '' constraints of the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 represents the consumption of the @xmath56-th resource by a single trial in the @xmath57-th design point , and @xmath58 represents a limit on the @xmath56-th resource .",
    "the interpretation of leads to the following assumptions :    * resource limits are positive and finite , i.e. , @xmath59 .",
    "* augmenting designs can not decrease the consumption of any resource , i.e. , @xmath60 for all @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "* no trial is completely free and its replication must eventually result in exceeding some resource limit , i.e. , for all @xmath62 there is some @xmath61 such that @xmath63 .    clearly , constraint is a special case of with @xmath64 , @xmath65 for all @xmath62 , and @xmath66 .",
    "sometimes , however , the costs depend on design points and the budget of the experiment is limited by @xmath67 financial units ( e.g. , section 6 in @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite ) .",
    "this restriction can be formalized by one resource constraint ( @xmath64 ) such that @xmath68 , and @xmath69 represent possibly unequal costs of trials in individual design points .",
    "a natural type of restrictions are the so - called direct constraints ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , which correspond to performing at most @xmath70 trials in design points @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "often , it is possible to perform at most one observation in any design point , i.e. , @xmath71 for all @xmath72 , as in @xcite .",
    "this can be converted to the resource constraints by setting @xmath73 , @xmath74 ( the kronecker delta ) and @xmath75 for all @xmath61 .",
    "another class of constraints corresponds to the so - called marginal restrictions ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) or , more generally , strata restrictions ( @xcite ) . in this case ,",
    "design space @xmath1 is partitioned into non - overlapping sets @xmath76 and any experimental design @xmath19 must satisfy @xmath77 for all @xmath61 , where @xmath78 are given positive numbers . here",
    ", we obtain by setting @xmath79 $ ] ( the indicator function ) and @xmath80 for all @xmath61 .",
    "the resource constraints can also accommodate general limits on the availability of experimental material , such as treatment samples in block designs ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : consider some selection @xmath76 of subsets of @xmath1 and assume that for a trial in any design point @xmath81 , one piece of experimental material from a pool of @xmath82 available pieces is consumed .",
    "this leads to the resource constraints with @xmath79 $ ] and @xmath80 for all @xmath61 , similarly to the stratified designs .",
    "yet another type of constraint is the requirement that the trials should not be in `` close '' design points .",
    "for instance , if @xmath83 represents a sequence of time moments of trials , then the experimenter may be faced with a technical requirement that consecutive trials must be at least @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) time moments apart .",
    "this is also possible to express using @xmath86 resource constraints by setting @xmath87 $ ] for all @xmath61 , @xmath72 , and @xmath88 for all @xmath61 .",
    "see section 5 in @xcite for an example .    however , we remark that there do exist some reasonable experimental design restrictions that can not be represented by , for instance non - standard equality constraints on some of the values @xmath89 , or limits on transitional costs ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath90 be either an exact design representing trials that have already been performed , or a required initial part of the experiment .",
    "we will assume that @xmath90 satisfies .",
    "in the situation without existing / required trials , the design @xmath90 is simply the zero vector @xmath91 .    in matrix form",
    ", the system can be written as @xmath92 componentwise , where @xmath93 is the @xmath94 matrix of coefficients @xmath55 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath95 is the @xmath96-dimensional vector of @xmath97 .",
    "the assumptions ( c1)-(c3 ) guarantee that the set @xmath98 of all feasible exact experimental designs is non - empty and finite .",
    "although general enough to represent many practical restrictions on experimental design , set @xmath99 is still relatively simple to be explored by heuristic optimization methods based on transitions between `` neighbouring '' feasible solutions .",
    "the assumptions also imply that the set of all feasible approximate designs @xmath100 is a non - empty , compact and convex polyhedron .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop a method for solving the general resource - constrained exact optimal design problem @xmath101    if we assume @xmath102 , set @xmath103 is the polygon @xmath104 and set @xmath99 is the intersection of @xmath103 with the integer lattice . if we have , for instance , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 , then , the globally @xmath0-optimal exact design found by the complete enumeration is @xmath108 , that is , @xmath109 plates should be painted with one coat and @xmath110 plates should be painted with two coats .",
    "although the problem is very small , the @xmath0-criterion has as many as @xmath111 strict local optima , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 on @xmath99 if , for each exact design @xmath19 , we allow transitions to all natural neighbours of @xmath19 , where @xmath116 , @xmath117 . ] that belong to @xmath99 .",
    "besides optimum design , optimization covers many other difficult discrete optimization problems , for instance knapsack problems ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , optimal redundancy allocation in reliability theory ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , and constructing @xmath118-optimal graphs ( see section [ dblock ] for more details ) .    for small to medium size problems of type , it is possible to use an `` intelligent '' enumeration method , such as branch - and - bound or branch - and - cut , that guarantees a globally optimal solution ( see @xcite , @xcite , cf .",
    "@xcite ) . nevertheless , there is no practical hope of creating an algorithm that rapidly produces provably optimal solutions of large instances of . often , the only possibility is to use a heuristic that usually leads to an efficient feasible experimental design .    a natural approach to solving is to use a heuristic based on `` excursions '' within the set of designs , as in some early algorithms for computing @xmath0-optimal experimental designs under the standard constraint , see , e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . from these algorithms ,",
    "the most relevant to our problem is the detmax procedure proposed by mitchell ( @xcite ) , which is related to the tabu search methods ( e.g. , @xcite , see also @xcite ) .    today , the most popular methods for solving the standard optimal design problems are local - search exchange heuristics ( e.g. , chapter 12 in @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "however , the exchange heuristics can not be directly used to solve instances of the general problem , since the number of trials of the optimal resource constrained design is not known in advance and , in addition , an exchange of two design points may render a feasible design non - feasible .",
    "moreover , our experience shows that problems with resource constraints tend to have a large number of local optima ( cf .",
    "example [ example ] ) , i.e. , an efficient modification of exchange heuristics requires means for overcoming their local - search nature .",
    "as far as more general constraints are concerned , an idea similar to detmax has already been used in reliability theory to efficiently solve redundancy optimization problems ( see @xcite ) . in the area of optimal design of experiments ,",
    "the paper @xcite studied a modification of the detmax procedure capable of computing optimal designs under direct constraints . in @xcite ,",
    "another related procedure has been developed , based on a sequential removal of a single design point and a subsequent augmentation of the resulting design by a greedy method .",
    "however , this method is restricted to solving optimum design problems with particular kind of direct constraints combined with a single cost constraint .",
    "finally , the paper @xcite describes a randomized algorithm similar to simulated annealing that can be used to solve the general problem .",
    "this algorithm had been a starting point of the development of the heuristic proposed in this paper .",
    "we will say that a design @xmath119 is created from a design @xmath120 by a forward step ( or a backward step ) if @xmath121 ( or @xmath122 ) for some standard unit vector @xmath123 .",
    "a design @xmath120 will be called `` maximal '' if it can not be augmented without violation of some of the resource constraints , that is , if all designs created from @xmath19 by a forward step are non - feasible .    for a design @xmath120 ,",
    "an upper neighbour is any feasible design that can be obtained from @xmath19 by a forward step , i.e. , the set of all upper neighbours of @xmath19 is @xmath124 similarly , a lower neighbour of a feasible design @xmath19 is any design that can be obtained from @xmath19 by a backward step , that is , the set of all lower neighbours of @xmath19 is @xmath125 note that @xmath126 , and @xmath127 if and only if @xmath19 is maximal .",
    "we will also assume that @xmath90 is not maximal , which means that @xmath128 for any feasible design @xmath19 .    clearly",
    ", properties ( c1)-(c3 ) imply that any feasible exact design is reachable from any other feasible exact design by a sequence of forward and backward steps within @xmath99 .",
    "moreover , an optimal solution of can be found among maximal designs , in view of assumption ( m ) .",
    "the proposed algorithm starts in a design @xmath129 ( cf .",
    "subsection [ subsec : ini ] ) and builds an excursion in the set of feasible exact designs , guided by a `` tabu '' list @xmath130 of characteristic attributes ( e.g. , numeric identifiers ) of the designs that have already been visited .",
    "let @xmath131 be a characteristic attribute of @xmath132 and let @xmath133 be a local heuristic evaluation of @xmath19 , i.e. , a real number that roughly estimates how promising @xmath19 is as a part of an excursion leading to an efficient design ( see subsections [ subsec : attr ] and [ subsec : val ] for a more detailed specification of @xmath134 and @xmath135 ) .",
    "let @xmath19 represent the current design in the excursion .",
    "the algorithm first attempts a forward step ( if @xmath136 ) or a backward step ( if @xmath137 ) , moving to a neighbouring feasible exact design @xmath20 .",
    "design @xmath20 is chosen such that it maximizes @xmath135 among all designs satisfying @xmath138 .",
    "if the algorithm attempts a forward step but there is no @xmath139 such that @xmath138 , or if it attempts a backward step but there is no @xmath140 such that @xmath138 , the algorithm tries to reverse the direction of the search .",
    "if all these attempts fail , i.e. , if the attributes of all neighbouring designs of @xmath19 are contained in the list @xmath130 , the algorithm resolves this `` blockage '' by randomly selecting a design from @xmath141 for the next step .",
    "each time a maximal design is encountered , the algorithm checks whether it is better than the best feasible design @xmath142 found so far .",
    "if the number of backward steps of an excursion exceeds a constant @xmath143 , the excursion is declared to be a `` failure '' and the algorithm is restarted from the currently best design .",
    "note that the list @xmath130 is not cleared after the restart , that is , the new excursion will follow a different path .",
    "the algorithm is terminated once the computation time exceeds a user - supplied time limit @xmath144 .",
    "the idea of the algorithm is made more precise by its meta - heuristic scheme ; see algorithm [ hugo ] .",
    "thus , the algorithm is similar to the detmax procedure , because it attempts a forward or a backward step depending on an attribute of the current design .",
    "since most of the designs encountered have not been previously visited , the excursions tend to move towards maximal designs .",
    "note , however , that even under the standard constraint , algorithm [ hugo ] differs from the detmax procedure in several important aspects .",
    "for instance , unlike algorithm [ hugo ] , the detmax procedure does not avoid the backward steps to the designs with attributes in the tabu list , which often leads to retracing the same excursions .",
    "of course , from the point of view of this paper , the main disadvantage of the detmax algorithm is that it is only suitable for computing optimal designs under the standard constraint on the size of the experiment .",
    "@xmath145 ; @xmath146 ; @xmath147      an important part of algorithm [ hugo ] is the choice of the initial design @xmath148 .",
    "our experience shows that a reasonably efficient design can usually be obtained by choosing @xmath149 , but for more complex problems it is better to use multiple restarts of the heuristic , with initial designs created by a sequence of random forward steps starting from @xmath90 .",
    "another possibility is to take an optimal approximate design @xmath150 and set @xmath151 , where @xmath152 denotes the floor function .",
    "the nature of the resource constraints guarantees that the design @xmath148 constructed in this way will be feasible . for computing approximate optimal designs under various types of linear constraints , one can use efficient convex optimization methods , see , for instance , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the characteristic attribute should be chosen such that , loosely speaking , it assigns different values to substantially different designs and the same values to essentially same designs ( for instance to algebraically isomorphic designs ) .",
    "after some experimentation , we have decided to use the attribute @xmath153 equal to the value @xmath154 rounded to @xmath155 significant digits .",
    "note that instead of storing complete designs , storing real - valued attributes in the list @xmath130 not only makes the time and memory requirements much smaller , but sometimes makes the tabu principle itself more efficient .",
    "this is the case in models with many statistically isomorphic designs , because including an attribute based on @xmath154 into @xmath156 has the effect of `` blocking '' also all designs isomorphic with @xmath19 .      in our implementation of algorithm [ hugo ] ,",
    "the local heuristic evaluation @xmath157 of a design @xmath20 is an estimate of the maximal value of @xmath23 on the set of all designs augmenting @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath157 is an estimate of @xmath158 the rationale behind this particular evaluation is that if we were able to use the exact values of @xmath159 , the initial greedy phase of the algorithm started from @xmath90 would directly lead to a globally optimal solution .    for @xmath119 ,",
    "let @xmath160 be the vector of residual amounts of resources .",
    "note that after a forward or a backward step , it is possible to use the update formula @xmath161    for every @xmath62 , let @xmath162    the vector @xmath163 estimates the direction towards `` large '' feasible designs .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath164 define @xmath165 where @xmath166 .",
    "if @xmath167 , i.e. , if @xmath20 is a maximal design , define @xmath168 .",
    "the vector @xmath169 is the `` largest '' feasible approximate design in the direction @xmath170 .",
    "thus , the value @xmath171 gives us a rough estimate of @xmath172 .",
    "for some designs @xmath119 the vector @xmath173 may have non - integer components , that is , the proposed heuristic evaluation is based on the criterial values of general approximate designs .",
    "we remark that formulas - can be substantially simplified for some specific types of constraints .",
    "for instance , if we consider only the standard constraint , then @xmath174 where @xmath175 for any @xmath119 , where @xmath176 .",
    "note that the heuristic evaluation of designs is chosen such that it depends only on the set @xmath103 itself , not on the choice of the algebraic definition of @xmath103 .",
    "furthermore , the excursions only depend on the ordering of approximate designs determined by the criterion @xmath23 , not on the chosen `` version '' of the same criterion .    clearly , there are many other methods of computing a local design evaluation in algorithm [ hugo ] .",
    "for instance , it is possible to use some variant of the direct greedy method based on the relative change of @xmath23 with respect to a change in residual resources , similarly to @xcite .",
    "these methods may allow for a more rapid construction of the excursion , nevertheless , they may also lose the above - mentioned invariance properties .",
    "moreover , in our experiments with various modifications of move selection rules , we did not observe a significant increase in the quality of results .",
    "in this section , we will apply algorithm [ hugo ] to the most common situation in optimal design of experiments - computation of @xmath0-efficient experimental designs for regression models with independent homoscedastic errors , as described in the introduction .",
    "although the chosen criterion is always the same , the selected optimization problems have very different sets of feasible designs .",
    "our experience suggests that the feasible set has a more pronounced effect on the complexity of the optimization problem than the choice of the criterion within the class of standard criteria used for optimal design .    to demonstrate the universality of algorithm [ hugo ] , we selected the same heuristic parameters in all examples ( namely , @xmath177 steps and @xmath178 significant digits ) .",
    "we ran all computations for @xmath179 seconds to estimate the time after which the heuristic does not lead to substantial improvements .",

    "note that the efficiencies relative to the approximate optimal designs represent lower bounds on the efficiencies relative to the ( unknown ) perfectly optimal exact designs . additionally , the results are very stable in spite of the completely random selection of initial designs .",
    "there are two mathematical programming methods that can be applied to the constrained problem from this subsection .",
    "the method based on integer quadratic programming ( iqp ; @xcite ) is often fast and simple to use , but , for this particular problem , it tends to produce worse results than algorithm [ hugo ] .",
    "the approach based on mixed integer second order cone programming ( misocp ; @xcite ) gives more efficient designs than iqp , but its results are still slightly worse than the results of algorithm [ hugo ] , even if the misocp solver is run for a very long time .",
    "the iqp and the misocp methods are more complex than algorithm [ hugo ] , often provide worse designs , and require an advanced integer programming solver . nevertheless , note that they can be applied under more general linear constraints than algorithm [ hugo ] .",
    "moreover , the misocp method provides a non - trivial lower bound on the efficiency of the resulting design .    to show a concrete example of a marginally and cost constrained design",
    ", we chose @xmath276 ; see figure [ tycecost ] for the result .",
    "the exact design obtained in @xcite by misocp has @xmath0-efficiency of about @xmath277 relative to the exact design obtained by algorithm [ hugo ] .",
    "the third example is taken from @xcite .",
    "suppose that we wish to find the best sequence of sampling times for a model relating time and internal concentrations of fluoranthene in an organism .",
    "the mean internal concentration at time @xmath118 of the experiment is given by @xmath278 where @xmath279 and @xmath280 are parameters corresponding to the constant uptake and elimination rates .",
    "the experiment will be initiated at a starting time @xmath281 and all observations need to be performed within the following @xmath282 hours .",
    "hence , an appropriate designs space is @xmath283 and the elements @xmath284 represent the time ( in hours ) elapsed from @xmath281 .",
    "the model in consideration is non - linear , therefore we will compute the locally @xmath0-optimal designs ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . to this end",
    ", we need to linearise the model in some fixed parameters @xmath285 and @xmath286 .",
    "since the model is linear in @xmath279 , the choice of @xmath285 is irrelevant . for @xmath280",
    ", we will select the nominal value @xmath287 suggested in @xcite by earlier experiments .",
    "thus , we will consider the @xmath0-optimal design problem for the linear regression model with independent homoscedastic errors and two - dimensional regressors @xmath288 where @xmath284 is the design point corresponding to the time of the observation , @xmath289 is the index of the design point , and @xmath290 denotes the gradient .",
    "the experiment requires observations at @xmath291 , @xmath292 , and @xmath293 hours of the experiment .",
    "thus , the design @xmath90 to be augmented satisfies @xmath294 , and @xmath295 for all @xmath296 .    in accord with @xcite",
    ", we also assume that the experimental budget of the practitioner is limited by @xmath297 price units .",
    "moreover , the sampling costs vary throughout the week . for a starting time @xmath281",
    ", we can divide the design space @xmath1 as @xmath298 where @xmath299 denotes the sampling times with regular hourly wage on weekdays ( 8 am - 5 pm , monday to friday ) , @xmath300 denotes the sampling times with double wage on the weekend ( 7 pm friday - 6 am monday ) , and @xmath301 denotes the sampling times with @xmath302 of regular wage ( all other times ) .",
    "hence , if @xmath303 is the cost of taking a sample at a time with a regular hourly wage , the cost of taking one sample in @xmath300 will be @xmath304 and the cost of taking a sample in @xmath301 will be @xmath305 .",
    "we are interested in finding optimal designs that do not exceed the budget @xmath306 .",
    "additionally , we can perform at most one observation in each design point .",
    "formally , the constraints required by the experimental set - up can be expressed as : @xmath307 and @xmath308 , @xmath309 , for any feasible design @xmath19 .",
    "we have used algorithm [ hugo ] as well as the heuristic from @xcite to compute @xmath0-efficient designs for starting times @xmath310 . to express the quality of the obtained designs , we have evaluated their efficiencies relative to the locally @xmath0-optimal approximate designs computed by maxdet programming ; see figure [ workweek ] .",
    "similarly to the previous examples , the results of algorithm [ hugo ] are very stable ; all random restarts resulted in the same design except for @xmath311 .",
    "moreover , all @xmath312 results of algorithm [ hugo ] were the same or better , however , because of its deterministic nature , it can not further improve its results . ] the corresponding results from @xcite with the following exceptions : @xmath180 results for @xmath313 , @xmath245 results for @xmath314 , @xmath260 result for @xmath315 , and @xmath180 results for @xmath316 . in the most problematic case of @xmath316 ,",
    "the @xmath0-efficiency of all @xmath180 results of algorithm [ hugo ] is only @xmath317 relative to the design found by the heuristic from @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , our computational experiments show that for @xmath316 algorithm [ hugo ] detects the optimal design after @xmath318 to @xmath319 seconds , depending on the initial design .",
    "concrete examples of the experimental designs ( for the starting time @xmath320 ) are depicted in figure [ ww73 ] . for this case",
    "the relative efficiency of the design found by algorithm [ hugo ] with respect to the approximate @xmath0-optimal design is @xmath321 , whereas for the design obtained by @xcite , the @xmath0-efficiency is @xmath322 .",
    "we showed that the resource constraints cover many types of experimental design restrictions , and that the optimal design problems associated with these restrictions can be efficiently solved by a common heuristic .",
    "for simplicity , we computed the numerical examples for the criterion of @xmath0-optimality , but it is straightforward to apply the heuristic to any monotonic criterion .",
    "moreover , the algorithm can be as easily applied to statistical models different from the standard regression .",
    "there are many variants of the proposed heuristic that could enhance its performance in specific situations .",
    "besides alternative choices of initial designs , formulas for designs characteristic attributes and local heuristic evaluations , it might also be possible to improve the efficiency of the heuristic by a different notion of a `` failed '' excursion , or variations in the manipulation with the list @xmath130 .",
    "since the heuristic is based on forward and backward steps , the speed of the execution could also be enhanced using the update formulas from @xcite , chapter 12 .    clearly",
    ", multitudes of nature - inspired optimization heuristics , such as physical , evolutionary and swarm algorithms are also applicable to solving problems of type , either directly or using a penalty approach to take the constraints into account ( cf . , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , cf .",
    "also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for the applications of these methods to the standard optimum design problem ) .",
    "however , these methods usually require a large amount of programmer s experience , numerical experimentation and fine tuning of parameters to fit the specific properties of the optimization problem at hand .    thus , besides introducing the general resource constrained problem in the area of experimental design , a secondary aim of this paper was to provide a simple , universal , yet reasonably efficient benchmark method for testing more advanced techniques that might be developed in the future .",
