    "<S> experiments on polarized fermion gases performed by trapping ultracold atoms in optical lattices , allow the study of an attractive hubbard model for which the strength of the on site interaction is tuned by means of a feshbach resonance . using a well - known particle - hole transformation </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how results obtained for this system can be reinterpreted in the context of a doped repulsive hubbard model . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we show that the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state corresponds to the striped state of the two - dimensional doped positive u hubbard model . </S>",
    "<S> we then use the results of numerical studies of the striped state to relate the periodicity of the fflo state to the spin polarization </S>",
    "<S> . we also comment on the relationship of the @xmath0 superconducting phase of the doped 2d repulsive hubbard model to a d - wave spin density wave state for the attractive case .    using standing wave laser light fields and optical feshbach resonances , </S>",
    "<S> ultracold atomic gases can be used to realize a variety of hubbard like models.@xcite technically if one wants a strong interaction , it appears easier to create an ultracold fermi gas ( e.g. , @xmath1li ) with an attractive interaction and experiments on polarized fermion gases with attractive interactions have been carried out to look for exotic superfluid states.@xcite    one state of particular interest is the fflo state which arises from pairing across the spin - split fermi surface of a spin polarized system.@xcite in this state the cooper pairs have a finite center of mass momentum leading to spatial oscillations of the pair field order parameter and the spin polarization . here </S>",
    "<S> , making use of density - matrix - renormalization - group ( dmrg ) results@xcite for the doped , positive u hubbard model and a well - known particle - hole transformation,@xcite we discuss the properties of the fflo state for the case of a half - filled spin polarized negative u hubbard model on a two - dimensional lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we also comment on the relationship of this to the question of whether the doped positive u hubbard model may have a @xmath0 superconducting ground state .    </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian for a half - filled negative u hubbard model in an external zeeman field , @xmath2 , can be written as    @xmath3    @xmath4    here @xmath5 is a nearest neighbor one - electron hopping , @xmath6 is positive so the onsite interaction is @xmath7 and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the operator @xmath9 creates a fermion with spin @xmath10 on site @xmath11 , the sum @xmath12 is over nearest neighbor sites of a square lattice and @xmath13 is the number operator . in the case of the ultracold gases , a spin polarization @xmath14 </S>",
    "<S> is achieved by loading more atoms in the `` up '' pseudo - spin hyperfine state than in the `` down '' state .    in the mean - field fflo state , </S>",
    "<S> the cooper pairs have a finite center of mass momentum which , for a two dimensional tight binding band structure , lays along the ( 1,0 ) or the ( 1,1 ) direction depending upon the ratio of @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> for the case in which it lays along the ( 1,0 ) direction , the order parameter exhibits a one - dimensional oscillation along the @xmath16 direction    @xmath17    here we have chosen the phase so that @xmath18 is negative . </S>",
    "<S> the spin polarization also varies in space with    @xmath19    here @xmath20 and @xmath21 give the leading weak coupling harmonic behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial variation of @xmath22 and @xmath23 are schematically illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] . at stronger coupling </S>",
    "<S> higher harmonics can enter giving a more localized behavior .    </S>",
    "<S> since the possibility of an fflo state was originally proposed,@xcite there has been great interest in determining whether it exists and exploring its properties . in particular , with the possibility of observing such a state in ultracold atomic gases , there have been a number of theoretical calculations.@xcite these calculations have been based upon a mean field description . here </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the case of a two - dimensional half - filled lattice gas where it is important to treat strong coupling effects . </S>",
    "<S> one would like to know if the fflo state survives beyond the mean field approximation , whether the stripes run vertically ( or horizontally ) as in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 ] ) or diagonally , and whether the periodicity of the spatial variation which determines @xmath24 remains at its mean field value .    </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian for the negative u hubbard model in a zeeman field can be transformed under a unitary transformation to a doped positive u hubbard model . </S>",
    "<S> this transformation , introduced by emery,@xcite has been a staple in quantum monte carlo work where it was used to show that the fermion sign problem is absent for the half - filled hubbard model with a near - neighbor hopping.@xcite it has also been used , as we will review , to provide a map between the half - filled negative u hubbard model in a zeeman field and the doped positive u hubbard model.@xcite under this transformation we will see that the fflo state becomes the familiar striped , charge density , and @xmath25-phase shifted antiferromagnetic state of the doped positive u hubbard model .    for a unitary transformation in which    @xmath26    the hamiltonian given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:1 ] ) becomes    @xmath27    @xmath28    with @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the half - filled negative u hubbard model with spin polarization @xmath30 is mapped into a positive u hubbard model with a site filling @xmath31 . under this transformation eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:2 ] ) becomes    @xmath32    with @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the system has rotational symmetry so that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:6 ] ) implies that the staggered spin order is modulated by @xmath34 .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath35    similarly , the spin polarization , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:3 ] ) , transforms to the hole density giving @xmath36 thus the fflo state maps to the striped state of the doped positive u hubbard model in which charged stripes separate @xmath25-phase shifted antiferromagnetic regions .    </S>",
    "<S> mean field studies@xcite of the doped , two - dimensional positive u hubbard model with a nearest - neighbor hopping find that the domain - walls run along the @xmath16 or @xmath37-directions for @xmath38 . for values of @xmath39 </S>",
    "<S> the domain - walls run diagonally and for @xmath15 greater than 8 the domain - walls are found to be unstable with respect to the formation of magnetic polarons.@xcite the mean field domain walls are found to contain one hole per site along the wall and one says that the domain wall is filled with holes . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the spacing of the vertical ( or horizontal ) charged domain walls is equal to @xmath40 , giving the mean field result @xmath41 for such walls . a schematic illustration of the mean field results for @xmath42 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1]a .    </S>",
    "<S> -wave order parameter @xmath22 ( solid ) and the spin polarization @xmath23 ( dashed ) in an fflo state with @xmath42 . ( </S>",
    "<S> a ) the mean field result with a period for @xmath22 of @xmath43 and ( b ) with a period @xmath44 expected from dmrg calculations on long stripes.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] 0.3 cm    now these are mean field results and at larger values of u one is dealing with a strongly correlated system . </S>",
    "<S> thus one might wonder whether the fflo state remains the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> this is a question that has also played a central role in the high @xmath45 cuprate problem . </S>",
    "<S> there one would like to know if the ground state of the doped hubbard model is striped or possibly a @xmath0 superconductor , and what is the nature of the interplay between stripes and pairing.@xcite present dmrg calculations on 6-leg hubbard ladders find a striped ground state.@xcite , while dynamic cluster monte carlo calculations@xcite on periodic lattices find evidence of a @xmath0 superconducting state . </S>",
    "<S> whether the difference of lattice aspect ratios and boundary conditions or subtle numerical biases are responsible for this disagreement is not known . </S>",
    "<S> it does , however , appear that these two states are very close in energy . here </S>",
    "<S> we will use the dmrg results for the striped state to discuss the nature of the fflo state and then conclude by noting what would happen for the @xmath0 state .    </S>",
    "<S> the dmrg calculations have been carried out on 6-leg doped positive u hubbard ladders . </S>",
    "<S> periodic boundary conditions have been imposed in the 6-leg direction and open boundary conditions are used in the long @xmath16-direction . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> 10 , the results have been extrapolated to infinite length ladders . </S>",
    "<S> these numerical results find that the ground state exhibits the striped structure shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] for a @xmath46 ladder with @xmath47 and 12 holes corresponding to a doping @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the figure shows the hole density @xmath49 and the staggered spin density @xmath50 versus @xmath51 . for this doping , </S>",
    "<S> extrapolated dmrg results@xcite show that the ground state is striped for @xmath52 . for a 6-leg tube , </S>",
    "<S> the stripes are found to contain 4 holes ( 2/3 filled stripes ) so that the charge stripe spacing is @xmath53 with @xmath31 .     </S>",
    "<S> ( dashed red ) and the staggered spin @xmath54 ( solid blue ) densities along the leg direction for a @xmath55 hubbard ladder with 12 holes and @xmath47 . as discussed in the text </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath56 corresponds to the spin polarization @xmath23 and @xmath54 corresponds to the @xmath10-wave pairfield order parameter @xmath22 of the fflo state.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] 0.3 cm    calculations on an 8-leg @xmath57 ladder find that the stripes are half - filled and there is evidence that this is the preferred filling.@xcite these calculations show that the holes that make up the stripe exhibit short range pairing correlations@xcite in which the sign of the singlet pair field associated with two sites connected by a hopping perpendicular to the stripe is opposite to that of the case in which the hopping is parallel to the stripe . these d - wave like pairing correlations of the holes in the stripe </S>",
    "<S> are not taken into account in the mean field calculations which find filled stripes . for half - filled stripes , </S>",
    "<S> the spacing between the charged stripes is @xmath58 so that the numerical calculations on the longer stripes imply that @xmath24 for the fflo state will be twice that found in the mean field calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath59    in this case , the fflo state will have half the spatial period of the mean field solution , as illustration in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1]b .    </S>",
    "<S> here we have made use of dmrg calculations which were carried out on systems with periodic boundary conditions in one direction and open boundary conditions in the other . in cold atoms experiments , </S>",
    "<S> one is generally dealing with an underlying optical lattice in a slowly varying trap potential which acts as a spatially dependent chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to soft boundaries and the simultaneous coexistence of spatially separated phases . </S>",
    "<S> the details of this depend upon the total filling as well as the curvature of the confining trap potential.@xcite in principle , the dmrg method is well suited to treating such soft boundaries but here we have focused our discussion on the idealized case of a two - dimensional lattice which has one fermion per site with an attractive feshbach tuned interaction and a spin polarization @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the fflo state of a 2d half - filled attractive spin polarized hubbard model is a unitary transform of the striped state of the doped repulsive hubbard model . </S>",
    "<S> thus an experimental observation of the fflo state in the above mentioned cold atom set - up would imply that the 2d doped repulsive hubbard model is striped . </S>",
    "<S> note that we have not shown that the striped state is the ground state of the two - dimensional doped repulsive u hubbard model . </S>",
    "<S> this remains an open question . </S>",
    "<S> we have simply shown that if the striped state were the ground state then this would imply that the fflo state would be found in the optical lattice experiments and that its periodicity would be given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:12 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the factor of two increase in @xmath24 represents an important change from the mean field result and reflects the tendency towards @xmath0 pairing.@xcite recent experiments also suggest that local pairing correlations are present on the cuprate stripes.@xcite    finding evidence for an fflo state in a cold attractive spin polarized fermi lattice gas would provide evidence that the low temperature phase of the doped positive u hubbard model is striped . </S>",
    "<S> if on the other hand , the @xmath0 superconducting state describes the low temperature phase of the repulsive hubbard model , then the transformation , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:4 ] ) , tells us that the cold atom system will exhibit a `` d - spin density wave '' ground state characterized by an order parameter    @xmath60    with @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> thus experiments on half - filled , spin polarized cold fermi lattice gases with attractive on site interactions and the search for the fflo state have important implications for the properties of the doped repulsive u hubbard model . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , our present understanding of the repulsive hubbard model can provide information relevant to experiments on the spin polarized attractive fermi gas . </S>"
