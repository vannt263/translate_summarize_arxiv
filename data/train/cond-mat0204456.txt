    "tight - binding theory was originally proposed as an _ ab initio _",
    "technique for calculating the electronic properties of crystalline solids from atomic wave functions.@xcite however , first - principles calculations based on a linear combination of atomic orbitals ( lcao ) are computationally very demanding , and the tight - binding approach met with relatively little success until slater and koster suggested that it be used as an interpolation scheme,@xcite in which the hamiltonian matrix elements are fitted to experimental data or to band structures computed by other methods .",
    "this made it possible to describe atomic - level physics in a basis of minimal size , leading to wide - ranging applications in many areas of condensed - matter physics .",
    "@xcite with modern computer capabilities , first - principles electronic - structure calculations are now commonplace , and _ ab initio _ tight - binding theories are flourishing .",
    "@xcite yet even today , the empirical theory @xcite predominates ( even for the fitting of first - principles calculations ) because it is simple and physically intuitive .",
    "the formalism of @xcite is incomplete , however , in that it contains no prescription for coupling the electronic system to external electromagnetic fields . in _",
    "ab initio _ theories , @xcite one can use minimal coupling ( with suitable modifications for nonlocal potentials @xcite ) and calculate directly the necessary matrix elements of the momentum or velocity operator . in the empirical theory ,",
    "these matrix elements can simply be treated as extra fitting parameters , @xcite determined by fitting the dielectric function ( and thus oscillator strengths ) to experimental or first - principles spectra . however , even with the full use of symmetry restrictions , the number of additional parameters can be undesirably large ; for example , @xcite have proposed an @xmath0 model for gaas with 13 hamiltonian parameters and 17 independent momentum parameters .",
    "it is therefore clearly desirable to find ways of reducing or eliminating these extra fitting parameters .",
    "one possibility is to define a kinematic momentum operator ( equal to mass @xmath1 times velocity ) by @xmath2 , \\label{eq : pxh}\\ ] ] where * x * is the coordinate of the electron and @xmath3 is the hamiltonian . in a sense",
    "this merely trades one problem for another , since the coordinate matrix elements are still unknown , and the number of these allowed by symmetry is no less than the number of momentum matrix elements .",
    "however , it is physically reasonable to simplify the coordinate matrix by setting all nonlocal matrix elements to zero : @xmath4 .",
    "\\label{eq : x}\\ ] ] here @xmath5 is the ket vector for an orthogonalized atomic orbital ( lwdin orbital @xcite ) of type @xmath6 located at position @xmath7 .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 is an intra - atomic matrix element coupling orbitals @xmath6 and @xmath9 on the same atom .",
    "the simplest choice of all is to set @xmath10 in this model , there are no fitting parameters beyond those found in the hamiltonian .",
    "@xcite a closely related approach is the peierls substitution , @xcite in which the zero - field hamiltonian matrix @xmath11 for a particle of charge @xmath12 is replaced by @xmath13 in the presence of a vector potential @xmath14 and scalar potential @xmath15 .",
    "if the path of integration in eq.([eq : peierls ] ) is chosen to be a straight line , @xcite then the linear term in the taylor series expansion of this equation is the same as the @xmath16 coupling obtained from eqs.([eq : pxh])([eq : x0 ] ) .",
    "@xcite    the total elimination of extra fitting parameters makes this model an attractive one .",
    "however , by eliminating the intra - atomic matrix elements @xmath8 , one obtains a tight - binding model that is not valid in the tight - binding limit of isolated atoms .",
    "thus , although the model should provide a reasonable description of inter - atomic transitions between extended states , one has less confidence in its ability to describe localized states , which may be important at surfaces or interfaces .",
    "many authors have therefore suggested augmenting the zero - parameter model by including a small number of intra - atomic matrix elements .",
    "@xcite it has been shown for porous si that , although the intra - atomic matrix elements are small in magnitude ( in a bloch - function basis @xcite ) , the _ interference _ between these terms and the inter - atomic matrix elements contributes 25% of the total absorption .",
    "@xcite thus , it appears that a quantitative treatment of nanostructures may not be possible ( in general ) without the inclusion of intra - atomic matrix elements .",
    "the main difficulty with such models @xcite is that they are not gauge invariant . @xcite as shown by the examples in refs .   and",
    ", lack of gauge invariance can lead to gross qualitative errors in the predicted values of physical quantities .",
    "thus , there are significant problems with both approaches considered above .",
    "the models with @xmath17 are gauge invariant , but they can not describe intra - atomic transitions .",
    "the models with @xmath18 can describe intra - atomic transitions , but they are not gauge invariant .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate a technique for constructing tight - binding models that are gauge invariant and provide a full description of intra - atomic transitions .",
    "this is achieved by treating empirical tight - binding theory not as an approximation derived from the schrdinger equation , but as a fundamental quantum - mechanical system in its own right .",
    "this theory is required to satisfy all of the basic principles of quantum mechanics , the most important of which ( in the present context ) is the principle of local gauge symmetry .",
    "@xcite the essence of this principle is the concept that electromagnetism in quantum mechanics is the gauge - invariant manifestation of a nonintegrable ( i.e. , path - dependent ) phase factor .",
    "@xcite    as will be shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : coordinate ] below , the reason why existing models with intra - atomic coupling @xcite are not gauge invariant is that the coordinates @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 do not commute .",
    "@xcite gauge invariance requires commuting coordinates , the existence of which implies the existence of a basis of coordinate eigenkets . since empirical tight - binding theory deals with finite vector spaces , the coordinate basis is necessarily discrete .",
    "hence , the most general gauge - invariant finite vector space is a set of discrete coordinate eigenkets .",
    "this basis may be transformed to a tight - binding basis by constructing `` orbitals '' from symmetrized combinations of coordinate eigenkets ( using well - known techniques for symmetrizing plane waves @xcite ) .",
    "the concept of gauge symmetry on a discrete lattice is not new , having appeared many years ago as a technique for imposing a momentum cutoff in quantum chromodynamics .",
    "@xcite @xcite have recently suggested using lattice gauge techniques in empirical tight - binding theory .",
    "however , their proposal , like most applications of lattice gauge theory , is based on a simple cubic lattice . as shown below",
    ", the simple cubic lattice is unsuitable for practical tight - binding models because it can only achieve sufficient accuracy with an unreasonably large basis ( i.e. , a very small lattice constant ) .",
    "thus , the development of efficient tight - binding models requires consideration of more general geometries .",
    "@xcite have developed a lattice gauge theory for _ random _ lattices , which ( with some slight modifications ) is sufficiently general for the present purposes .",
    "however , the complete formal machinery of quantum chromodynamics is somewhat cumbersome when one is dealing only with simple electromagnetism .",
    "thus , for reasons of clarity , the author has chosen to present the theory in terms of a simple but elegant approach used by dirac .",

    "[ sec : topology ] , sec .",
    "[ sec : gauge ] presents an adaptation of dirac s analysis @xcite to the case of a discrete lattice .",
    "the outcome is a gauge - invariant formulation of electromagnetism in empirical tight - binding theory .",
    "although the theory derived in this way has many similarities with conventional tight - binding theory , there are significant differences as well .",
    "not all tight - binding models can be made gauge invariant ; @xcite this is possible only if the basis can be constructed from symmetrized coordinate eigenkets .",
    "in addition , local gauge symmetry imposes strong restrictions on the hamiltonian matrix , which have the effect of sharply reducing the number of allowed hamiltonian fitting parameters . finally , unlike previous empirical tight - binding theories , the present approach provides an explicit ( discrete ) wave function for the electron .    the formalism derived here",
    "is applied to two semiconductors with the diamond structure ( ge and si ) in sec .",
    "[ sec : application ] . for these systems ,",
    "a basis of 15 orbitals per atom is shown to provide a satisfactory fit to the valence bands and the lowest conduction bands ( up to about 5  ev above the valence - band maximum ) .",
    "these results are comparable to those obtained from a 10-orbital basis proposed recently in ref .  .",
    "the basis used here is 50% larger , but their model @xcite can not be made gauge invariant if intra - atomic coupling is included .",
    "thus , it appears that some tradeoffs are necessary if gauge invariance is to be achieved .",
    "as mentioned above , the intra - atomic coupling used in existing tight - binding models @xcite leads to a lack of gauge invariance .",
    "@xcite this may be seen from a simple @xmath22 model for a single atom . in this case , we know from atomic physics that there are coordinate matrix elements coupling the @xmath23 and @xmath24 orbitals : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is real . in the basis",

    "if a theory is gauge invariant , all physically measurable quantities must be independent of such transformations .",
    "but the expectation value @xmath36 is a measurable quantity , and under a gauge transformation one has @xmath37 where @xmath38 if @xmath33 depends on @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "hence , no theory can be gauge invariant if @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 do not commute .",
    "is there any way of achieving gauge invariance without setting @xmath39 ?",
    "perhaps the @xmath22 basis is too small , and the situation might be improved by including more orbitals ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "however , one soon finds that for any _ finite _ lcao basis , the lack of gauge invariance persists .",
    "this follows directly from the wigner - eckart theorem  since @xmath41 is a vector operator , it couples states with angular momentum @xmath42 to those with @xmath43 .",
    "hence , any finite truncation of the basis results in non - commuting coordinates .",
    "another possibility is to keep the same @xmath22 basis , but modify the coordinate matrix . the physical justification for doing so is the fact that the orbitals used in empirical tight - binding theory are not atomic orbitals ; they are _ orthogonalized _ atomic orbitals .",
    "@xcite therefore , they do not have the full rotational symmetry of atomic orbitals ; they have only the site symmetry of the crystal structure .",
    "for example , the atoms in a diamond crystal have site symmetry @xmath44 .",
    "@xcite therefore , the orbital that was denoted @xmath45 above should really be written as @xmath46 , since it belongs to the @xmath47 representation of @xmath44 .",
    "@xcite    however , the @xmath48 orbital @xmath49 also transforms as @xmath46 .",
    "thus , in the @xmath44 group , the matrix element @xmath50 is allowed , and the coordinate matrices ( [ eq : xy1 ] ) become @xmath51 , \\qquad y = \\left [     \\begin{array}{cccc }        0 & 0 & c & 0 \\\\        0 & 0 & 0 & b \\\\",

    "would imply that the @xmath24 and @xmath48 orbitals have equal weight in the @xmath47 states .",
    "this is not as absurd as it sounds ; @xcite have shown using first - principles pseudopotential calculations that for the @xmath47 states at the top of the valence band in gaas , the probability of finding an electron in a cation @xmath48 orbital is _ greater _ than that of finding it in a cation @xmath24 orbital .",
    "( in alas , the probability ratio is greater than 2.@xcite ) thus , it is not unreasonable to assume that @xmath55 and @xmath26 have comparable magnitudes .",
    "if one sets @xmath54 , then the coordinate operators have simultaneous eigenkets @xmath56 , which are given by @xmath57 note that the coordinate eigenvalues are located at the corners of a tetrahedron . in fact , the linear combinations given in ( [ eq : ccc ] ) are identical to the hybrid bond orbitals used in analytical tight - binding theories , @xcite although these are not ordinarily interpreted as exact coordinate eigenkets because the @xmath47 states are assumed to be pure @xmath24 orbitals .",
    "the procedure outlined above is rather clumsy ; one simply modifies the coordinate matrices by trial and error in an attempt to make them commute .",
    "one can not predict in advance whether the attempt will succeed , and in general it will not .",
    "however , the unitary transformation ( [ eq : ccc ] ) may be inverted to obtain @xmath58 which immediately suggests a more fruitful approach .",
    "the linear combinations given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : td ] ) are just what one would obtain by starting with a single coordinate eigenket ( say @xmath59 ) and using the symmetry operations of the tetrahedral group @xmath44 to construct `` symmetrized '' orbitals @xcite that transform according to the irreducible representations of @xmath44 .",
    "@xcite    thus , in this alternative approach , the coordinate basis is taken as fundamental , and the tight - binding basis is merely a secondary alternative that is useful for reasons of symmetry . since the existence of a coordinate representation is necessary for gauge invariance , no tight - binding basis can be made gauge invariant if it can not be represented in terms of symmetrized coordinate eigenkets .",
    "@xcite hence , this symmetrization procedure provides us with all possible gauge - invariant tight - binding models .",
    "the orbitals in eq .",
    "( [ eq : td ] ) are useful as a starting point , but they can not be interpreted as atomic orbitals because they do not have inversion symmetry . to obtain more `` atomic - like '' orbitals",
    ", one can apply the symmetry operations of the cubic group @xmath60 to the basis ket @xmath61 , which yields the orbitals @xmath62 here two different labels are used : the representations of @xmath60 , @xcite and the conventional atomic orbital notation .",
    "other orbitals not given here may be obtained from cyclic permutations of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "note that the @xmath44 orbital @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : td ] ) is the same as @xmath64 , whereas the @xmath44 orbital @xmath65 is just @xmath66 ) , the nonzero coordinate matrix elements are @xmath67 plus others given by cyclic permutations .",
    "the selection rules for @xmath41 are thus the same as those in a spherically symmetric atom ",
    "although , in any real atom , the matrix elements ( [ eq : x111 ] ) would not be numerically equal .",
    "this equality occurs because the basis kets ( [ eq : ccc_tb ] ) are degenerate eigenkets of the radial coordinate @xmath68 . to break the numerical equality",
    ", one would need to use basis functions with a linear combination of different radii .",
    "the above procedure may , of course , be applied to coordinate eigenkets other than @xmath59 .",
    "below is a list of the representations obtained by applying the symmetry operations of @xmath60 to several different `` generator '' eigenkets : @xmath69 explicit basis functions for these representations are given in appendix [ app : basis ] .",
    "with these results , one can now construct a gauge - invariant tight - binding model simply by putting a set ( or more than one set ) of these `` orbitals '' on each atom in a crystal or molecule .",
    "in such a model , the coordinate operators @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 commute by construction . however , one is no longer permitted to choose orbitals arbitrarily .",
    "the choices are limited to taking _ all _ of the orbitals in a set or taking _ none _ of them .",
    "as an example , one can not discard the @xmath70 orbitals in the basis generated by @xmath71 without destroying the gauge invariance of the theory .",
    "this approach yields a tight - binding model with orthogonal orbitals .",
    "another approach is to define a grid of coordinates , some points of which are not uniquely associated with individual atoms .",
    "one may still construct symmetrized orbitals in this case , but the orbitals are not orthogonal .",
    "this makes the tight - binding approach more difficult ; however , one can simplify the theory by choosing a bravais lattice for the coordinate grid , in which case the model may be viewed as a discrete pseudopotential model .",
    "applications of both the pseudopotential and tight - binding approaches are considered below in sec .",
    "[ sec : application ] .",
    "as we have seen , the most general gauge - invariant tight - binding basis consists of a set of discrete coordinate eigenkets , which will be referred to as a lattice .",
    "such a lattice is generally not periodic . in order to apply the principle of local gauge symmetry to such a system",
    ", one must be able to calculate the change in phase that occurs along any specified path in coordinate space .",
    "@xcite thus , the first step is to define what is meant by a `` path '' in a discrete coordinate system .",
    "in general , a path is just an ordered sequence of points . in a continuous coordinate system ,",
    "neighboring points in the sequence must be separated by an infinitesimal distance .",
    "this defines the _ topology _ of the system , in which points are linked together only if they are adjacent in coordinate space .",
    "it is desirable to define the topology of the discrete lattice in a similar way .    one way to do",
    "this is to construct a voronoi polyhedron around each site in the lattice .",
    "@xcite a voronoi polyhedron is just the region in space closest to that point ; @xcite if the lattice is a bravais lattice , the polyhedron is the same as a wigner - seitz cell . in mathematical terms , the voronoi polyhedron @xmath72 for site @xmath7 is the set of points @xmath41 such that @xmath73 for all @xmath74 .",
    "the topology is then defined by the following rule : if @xmath72 and @xmath75 share a surface with area @xmath76 , the sites @xmath7 and @xmath77 are linked together ; otherwise , they are not .    in some cases",
    ", it may happen that two voronoi polyhedra share only a point or a line , in which case @xmath78 . the linking algorithm presented in ref .",
    "does not consider this possibility ( because ref .",
    "deals only with random lattices , for which the probability of such an event is zero ) . for certain applications , it is useful to include links between such sites , @xcite but we shall see below that these links should be excluded in the present situation .",
    "thus , only adjacent sites whose voronoi polyhedra share a surface with @xmath76 are linked .",
    "a path in the discrete lattice is then just an ordered sequence of linked points , and a closed path is one whose first and last points are the same . by definition ,",
    "every edge of a voronoi polyhedron is equidistant from three or more lattice sites , all of which lie in a plane perpendicular to the given edge .",
    "these sites are closer to this edge than any other sites .",
    "the links between these sites form a closed path , and the area bordered by the links is called a `` plaquette . ''",
    "there is a one - to - one relationship between the plaquettes and the edges of the voronoi polyhedra .    the plaquettes partition all of coordinate space into nonoverlapping volumes called ( delaunay ) cells .",
    "each cell is uniquely associated with one corner of a voronoi polyhedron .",
    "the partitioning of space into cells is referred to as a delaunay tessellation .",
    "@xcite    a general algorithm for calculating the geometry of voronoi polyhedra , links , plaquettes , and cells is presented in appendix [ app : geometry ] .",
    "the expressions derived there will be of use in what follows .",
    "@xcite have developed a theory of local gauge symmetry on a random lattice .",
    "this section presents a modified version of their theory , with special emphasis on the implications of the principle of local gauge symmetry for tight - binding theory .",
    "the presentation follows dirac s approach , @xcite in which the existence of electromagnetic fields is `` derived '' as a straightforward consequence of a degree of freedom ( nonintegrable phases ) possessed by any quantum - mechanical system that can be represented in a coordinate basis .      in a discrete coordinate basis",
    ", any ket vector may be expressed as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a coordinate eigenket , which is assumed to be normalized such that @xmath81 dirac s starting point @xcite is the fact that physical predictions in quantum mechanics are ultimately expressed in terms of probabilities of the form @xmath82 , where the probability amplitude @xmath83 is given by @xmath84 the probability is obviously well defined even when the overall phase of @xmath85 has no definite value .",
    "this degree of freedom is referred to as global gauge symmetry .",
    "the existence of global gauge symmetry raises the question of whether it is necessary for the local probability amplitude @xmath86 to have a definite phase . in other words , suppose we write @xmath87 where the phase of @xmath88 is well defined ( to within an integer multiple of @xmath89 ) , but @xmath90 is a nonintegrable function  that is , the change in @xmath90 around a closed path can take on any value",

    "since the present system consists only of a single point particle , these nonintegrable phases must represent a field of force acting on the particle .",
    "the principle of local gauge symmetry is therefore defined by the following two postulates : @xcite ( i )  the physical predictions of the theory must be unambiguous .",

    "these two quantities are the fundamental dynamical variables that arise from the principle of local gauge symmetry .",
    "it will now be shown that @xmath95 and @xmath96 can be interpreted as _",
    "potentials _ for the electromagnetic field .",

    "a larger basis is needed in the present theory because the restrictions imposed by local gauge symmetry reduce the number of available hamiltonian fitting parameters .",
    "the field - particle coupling derived here is similar to that given by the peierls substitution , @xcite but the field - induced phase factor appears in the coordinate representation rather than the tight - binding representation .",

    "they have argued that this derivation justifies the use of the peierls substitution in tight - binding theory .",

    "there are , however , numerous difficulties with this approach .",
    "first , the lattice sites in lattice gauge theory represent states of the same particle at different positions .",
    "hence , these states are identical apart from their positions .",
    "however , in tight - binding theory the atoms are generally not the same .",
    "second , the field equations for a non - abelian gauge field are intrinsically nonlinear , because the field carries its own charge and is coupled directly to itself ( i.e. , it is self - radiating ) .",
    "it is therefore difficult to imagine how such a field could reproduce ordinary electromagnetism , in which the field has no charge , and nonlinearities arise only from interactions with matter .",
    "third , one would need to define a new gauge field theory every time one added new orbitals to the model , and every one of these non - abelian field theories would need to reproduce the results of abelian electromagnetic theory .",
    "finally , the coordinate operator in this approach would still have a discrete , degenerate eigenvalue spectrum .",
    "thus , it appears that the present approach  that is , an abelian @xmath446 gauge field in the coordinate representation  is the only gauge - invariant method for including electromagnetic fields in empirical tight - binding theory that tends toward the correct continuum limit as the basis dimensions are increased . in this case , the only way that the essential structure of the theory can be modified is to change the topology of the system so as to increase the number of links between lattice sites .",
    "this would increase the number of free parameters in the hamiltonian , thereby permitting a reduction in basis size .",
