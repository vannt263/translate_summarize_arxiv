    "in a recent comprehensive study by the cp - pacs collaboration of @xmath5=2 full qcd  @xcite , meson decay constants were found to exhibit a very large scaling violation over the range of lattice spacing @xmath6gev .",
    "this was disappointing since an rg - improved gluon action and sheikoleslami - wohlert quark action with tadpole - improved @xmath7 were used . in this calculation , however , one - loop perturbative @xmath4-factors , albeit tadpole - improved , were used for currents .",
    "a natural question was whether scaling becomes improved if non - perturbative @xmath4-factors are employed instead .    at lattice2001",
    ", we reported an initial study of this problem using the schrdinger functional ( sf ) method  @xcite within quenched qcd .",
    "we found the problem of anomalously large values appearing in the ensemble of hadron correlators toward strong coupling where cp - pacs data of decay constants had been taken . in this report , we have analyzed this problem in some detail .",
    "here we present our final results on the @xmath4-factors including these analysis .",
    "we follow the method developed by the alpha collaboration  @xcite , and work with a lattice geometry of @xmath8 with @xmath9 for @xmath0 with a vector operator at @xmath10 , and for @xmath1 with two axial vector operators at @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "tree - level values are used for the coefficients of boundary counter terms of the action . for improving the axial current",
    ", we adopt the one - loop perturbative value for the coefficient @xmath13 .",
    "values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are determined for @xmath14  8.0 which approximately covers the range of the cp - pacs quenched calculation  @xcite , @xmath15  2.575 .",
    "we have analyzed 20020000 configurations depending on @xmath16 value and lattice size .",
    "= 6.4 cm    it is straight - forward to calculate @xmath4-factors for @xmath17 . for lower @xmath16 values on large lattices such as @xmath18 , however , anomalously large values appear in the ensemble of hadron correlators .",
    "this makes it difficult to determine quark mass precisely , and since this means uncertainties in @xmath19 , also that of @xmath4-factors .",
    "we suspect that these `` exceptional '' configurations are an artifact of quenched approximation ; having very small or negative eigenvalues of the wilson - dirac operator , they would be suppressed in full qcd . since one can not distinguish `` exceptional '' configurations from `` normal '' ones on some rigorous basis , we restrict the configurations used for averaging to those having the value of a relevant hadron correlator below some cutoff .",
    "we then examine if uncertainties under variation of the cutoff are contained within some acceptable magnitude .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : m - dep ] we illustrate this test for @xmath20 for which a cutoff is set for @xmath21 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for definition ) .",
    "we estimate @xmath19 from @xmath20 with the cutoff value of 300 , because @xmath20 is rather stable there .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath20 at the @xmath19 is @xmath22 , once the cutoff of @xmath21 is taken in the range 200  1000 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mzvza ] we show how much the @xmath4-factors depend on @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath0 is insensitive to @xmath20 , and @xmath1 is consistent within 10% or so , albeit apparently exhibiting a more pronounced dependence .",
    "we analyze the uncertainties in the statistical averaging of @xmath4-factors themselves by applying a cutoff in @xmath23 , as carried out in ref .",
    "the conclusion is similar ; @xmath0 is very stable against variation of the cutoff , and @xmath1 shows a more conspicuous variation of 5% or so .",
    "uncertainties of @xmath1 on an @xmath24 lattice of order 15% in total lead to uncertainty of @xmath1 normalized at infinite volume of order 30% .",
    "the uncertainty , however , has little effect in a pad fit of @xmath1 and hence final results ; @xmath1 varies less than 3% at the largest coupling @xmath25 , even if we artificially shift @xmath1 at @xmath26 by 30% .",

    "the lattice scale is set through the string tension    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : size - dep - z ] , size dependence of @xmath4-factors becomes sizable toward strong couplings .",
    "since our quark action employs a tadpole - improved value of @xmath7 , we expect @xmath30 errors in the @xmath4-factors .",
