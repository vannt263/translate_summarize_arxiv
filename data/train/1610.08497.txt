    "a proper knowledge of the chemical composition of extragalactic hii  regions is essential for building chemical evolution models of galaxies .",
    "however , a well - known and unsolved issue in the physics of ionized nebulae is the so - called _ abundance discrepancy problem_. it refers to the difference between the chemical abundances determined from recombination lines ( rls ) and from collisionally excited lines ( cels ) of the same ion .",
    "abundances based on rls are systematically higher than those derived from cels .",
    "the traditional method used to derive abundances is based on cels because they are brighter and easier to detect than the optical rls . on the other hand ,",
    "the rls are less dependent on the variations of the physical conditions and therefore , they provide more stable abundances .",
    "measurements of the faint rls as cii  4267  and the multiplet 1 of oii  at about 4650  have permitted us to calculate the @xmath0 and @xmath1 abundances for a sample of hii  regions in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) . for each hii  regions , we computed the abundance discrepancy factor ( adf ) , which is defined as : @xmath2 where @xmath3 corresponds to the ionization state i of the element x.",
    "the sample comprises 5 hii  regions in the lmc and 4 in the smc .",
    "we observed 7 of these objects using the ultraviolet visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) at the very large telescope ( vlt ) at cerro de paranal observatory ( chile ) on 2003 march and 2013 november .",
    "the data of the other two hii regions were taken from @xcite and @xcite . in order to have an homogeneous data set , in these two cases",
    ", we took the measured line fluxes and performed the analysis in the same way than for the rest of the sample .    in this work",
    "we also used the c and o abundances of hii regions in other galaxies taken from the literature : the milky way ( @xcite ) , m101 ( @xcite ) , m33 ( @xcite ) and dwarf galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "we calculated the adf(@xmath1 ) for all the objects of the sample .",
    "the values show a fairly low dispersion in both galaxies . only the n44c region , which has heii lines in its spectrum , presents an adf(@xmath1 ) higher than the rest of the objects of the lmc .",
    "we also computed the adf(@xmath0 ) using the @xmath0 abundances derived from cels in the uv by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the results show a higher dispersion than the adf(@xmath1 ) . table [ tab : adf ] contains the adf of @xmath1 and @xmath0 for the hii regions in the lmc and smc .",

    "the left - panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] shows the results when we use the o abundances based in rls .",
    "we computed the average of adf(@xmath1 ) for different metallicity bins of the o / h ratio in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] .",
    "the results are difficult to interpret .",
    "the adf(@xmath1 ) shows a minimum value at 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath20 8.5 and increase when the o abundances are higher and lower drawing a seagull shape .",
    "the remarkably consistent value of the adf(@xmath1 ) obtained for the hii  regions of each one of the mcs has been the main reason to search for a metallicity - dependent behaviour of the adf .",
    "the trend we found for the low - metallicity objects seems to be clear , but the high dispersion at the highest metallicities ( 12 + log o / h @xmath21 8.7 ) has blurred any clear trend .    than the high - metallicity ones due to the high dispersion of the adf in this last brach of metallicity .",
    "we also studied the adf(@xmath0 ) as a function of the total o abundances .",
    "we find an apparent trend of a slightly larger adf(@xmath0 ) at lower abundances .",
    "unfortunately , there are only two determinations of the adf(c@xmath4 ) for metal - rich galactic hii  regions and they are uncertain , given the large aperture effects in extended hii   regions . however ,",
    "their adf(c@xmath4 ) are also larger than those of the objects with 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath20 8.5 , in agreement with the general behaviour shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] .",
    "an interesting test to explore the abundance discrepancy problem is to compare the abundances derived from cels and rls in hii  regions with those determined in b - type stars located in their vicinity .",
    "the o abundance of b - type stars should reflect the present - day chemical composition of the interstellar material in the regions where they were formed and are located .    in the left - panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] we compared our c and o nebular abundances with those determined by for b - type stars in the hii  regions n11 in the lmc and n66 in smc .",
    "we conclude that o abundances derived for b - type stars agree better with the nebular ones derived from cels than with those derived from rls .",
    "the c abundances determined from rls are too high and inconsistent with the stellar ones when we assume that part of the c is embedded in dust grains ( 0.10dex see @xcite ) .",
    "we studied the spatial distribution of o and c abundances as a function of the fractional galactocentric distances ( @xmath22 ) in the lmc and smc .",
    "table  [ tab : fits ] shows the radial abundance gradients for both galaxies .",
    "we find that the slope of the o / h gradient is almost the same using cels or rls and can be considered essentially flat in both galaxies . moreover ,",
    "the slope of c / h and c / o gradients in both galaxies can also be considered practically zero , in contrast with the results that are found in spiral galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .    [",

    "[ fig : f3 ] represents the slope of o / h , c / h and c / o gradients for different nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "the results we found strengthen those found by @xcite , where c / h and c / o gradients show a clear correlation with the absolute magnitude @xmath23 of the galaxies .",
    "the more luminous galaxies show steeper slopes of c and c / o than the less luminous ones .",
    "in addition , we studied the behaviour of c / o versus o / h ratios determined from rls in the right - panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : f3 ] .",
    "the position of the hii  regions in the figure suggests that the chemical evolution of the smc behaves as a typical star - forming dwarf galaxy , while the lmc seems to be similar to the external zones of small spiral galaxies .",
