    "nowadays , one of the key problems at the interface between fundamental physics and cosmology is to understand the physical mechanism behind the late - time acceleration of the universe . in principle",
    ", this phenomenon may be the result of unknown physical processes involving either modifications of gravitation theory or the existence of new fields in high energy physics .",
    "although the latter route is most commonly used , which gives rise to the idea of a dark energy component ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , following the former , at least two other attractive approaches to this problem can be explored .",
    "the first one is related to the possible existence of extra dimensions , an idea that links cosmic acceleration with the hierarchy problem in high energy physics , and gives rise to the so - called brane - world cosmology @xcite .",
    "the second one , known as @xmath0 gravity , examine the possibility of modifying einstein s general relativity ( gr ) by adding terms proportional to powers of the ricci scalar @xmath5 to the einstein - hilbert lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the cosmological interest in @xmath0 gravity dates back at least to the early 1980s and arose initially from the fact that these theories may exhibit an early phase of accelerating expansion without introducing new degrees of freedom @xcite . recently , @xmath0 gravity began to be thought of as an alternative to dark energy @xcite and a number of authors have explored their theeoretical and observational consequences also in this latter context .",
    "as a consequence , many questions have been raised and there is nowadays a debate about the viability of such theories ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , it seems that most of problems pointed out can not be generalized for all functional forms of @xmath0 .",
    "for example , it has been shown that specific forms of the function @xmath0 may be consistent with both cosmological and solar system - tests @xcite .",
    "non - linear coupling of matter with @xmath0 gravity has been discussed by @xcite , and @xcite discussed connections with mond theory as well as comparison with solar observables . besides , by starting from general principles such as the so - called energy conditions , and by generalizing them to @xmath0 gravity , @xcite have shown how to place broad constraints to any class of @xmath0 theory .    another important aspect worth emphasizing concerns the two different variational approaches that may be followed when one works with modified gravity theories , namely , the metric and the palatini formalisms ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the metric formalism",
    "the connections are assumed to be the christoffel symbols and variation of the action is taken with respect to the metric , whereas in the palatini variational approach the metric and the affine connections are treated as independent fields and the variation is taken with respect to both .",
    "in fact , these approaches are equivalents only in the context of gr , that is , in the case of linear hilbert action ; for a general @xmath0 term in the action they give different equations of motion .    for the metric approach ,",
    "a great difficulty in practice is that the resulting field equations are fourth order coupled differential equations which presents quite unpleasant behavior .",
    "in addition , simplest @xmath0 gravity models of the type @xmath6 have shown difficulties in issues such as passing the solar system tests @xcite , in having the correct newtonian limit @xcite and gravitational stability @xcite . in a recent study @xcite",
    "have shown that these theories can not produce a standard matter - dominated era followed by an accelerated expansion .",
    "on the other hand , the palatini variational approach provides second order differential field equations which can also account for the present cosmic acceleration without need of dark energy .",
    "recent studies @xcite have shown that the above cited power - law functional forms are capable of producing the last three phases of the cosmological evolution , i.e. , radiation - dominated , matter - dominated , and late time accelerating phases .",
    "some issues still of debate in literature are whether @xmath0 theories in palatini formalism satisfy the solar system tests and give the newtonian approximation @xcite , and whether they are free of gravitational instabilities @xcite .",
    "recent reviews on @xmath0 and other modified gravity theories can be found in @xcite .    from the observational viewpoint , however , it is important to look into whether these theories of gravity are indeed compatible with different kinds of currently available cosmological data . in particular ,",
    "the observational viability of some functional forms of @xmath0 gravity have been studied using mainly sne ia , cmb radiation and large scale structure ( lss ) data @xcite .    in this paper , by following @xcite ,",
    "we use determinations of the hubble parameter as a function of redshift @xcite to derive constraints on the parameters of the @xmath6 theory of gravity in the palatini approach .",
    "these determinations , based on differential age method , relates the hubble parameter @xmath1 directly to measurable quantity @xmath7 and can be achieved from the recently released sample of old passive galaxies from gemini deep deep survey ( gdds ) @xcite and archival data @xcite . the same data , along with other age estimates of high-@xmath8 objects ,",
    "were recently used to reconstruct the shape and redshift evolution of the dark energy potential @xcite , to place bounds on holography - inspired dark energy scenarios @xcite , as well as to impose constraints on the dark energy equation of state parameter ( @xmath9 ) by transforming the selected gdds observations into lookback time determinations @xcite .",
    "we also combine @xmath1 data with bao @xcite and the cmb shift parameters @xcite to better constrain the free parameters of our @xmath0 model . a brief discussion on the cosmic eras in the context of the palatini approach",
    "is also included .",
    "the simplest action that defines an @xmath0 gravity is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the gravitational constant and @xmath13 is the standard action for the matter fields . here",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 is the affine connection , which in the palatini approch is different from the levi - civita connection @xmath16 .    by varying the action with respect to the metric components we obtain the field equations @xmath17",
    "where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the matter energy - momentum tensor which , for a perfect - fluid , is given by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the energy density , @xmath22 is the fluid pressure and @xmath23 is the fluid four - velocity .",
    "variation of action ( [ actionjf ] ) with respect to the connection provides the equation that determines the generalized connection : @xmath24 = 0 $ ] , where @xmath25 is the covariant derivative with respect to the affine connection @xmath15 .",
    "this equation implies that one can write the conection @xmath26 as the levi - civita connection of a conformal metric @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the generalized ricci tensor is written in terms of this connection as @xmath28    we next consider an homogeneous and isotropic universe and investigate the cosmological dynamics of @xmath0 gravity in a flat friedmann - lemaitre - roberston - walker ( flrw ) background metric @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the cosmological scale factor . by expressing the generalized ricci tensor ( [ general_ric ] ) in terms of the ricci tensor @xmath31 associated with the metric @xmath32 we obtain the generalized friedmann equation @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the hubble parameter and a dot denotes derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath35 . here , we adopt the notation @xmath36 , @xmath37 and so on . the trace of eq .",

    "in this work we are particularly interested in testing the viability of a general functional form given by @xmath44 in a recent paper , @xcite have found that this model can be compatible with the supernova `` gold '' data set from @xcite for a given interval of the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "more recently , @xcite have shown that models of this kind are compatible with the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) data @xcite and also found narrow ranges for the values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 consistent with that from @xcite . here",
    "we will follow the numerical scheme used by @xcite to obtain the hubble function @xmath1 .",
    "firstly , we rewrite eqs.([trace ] ) and ( [ fe2 ] ) in terms of redshift parameter @xmath45 and the density @xmath46 : @xmath47 and @xmath48 with @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "an important aspect worth emphasizing at this point is that eqs .",
    "( [ trace2 ] ) and ( [ fe3 ] ) evaluated at @xmath51 impose a relation among @xmath3 , @xmath52 and @xmath4 , so that specifying the values of two of these parameters the third is automatically fixed . in other words , in the palatini approach , a @xmath53 theory introduces only one new parameter : @xmath3 or @xmath4 . in the following , we will always work with @xmath3 as the free parameter .    0.1 in",

    ", we will work with @xmath3 and @xmath52 as free parameters and study the bounds on them imposed by the svj05 @xmath1 data sample .",
    "we also marginalize over the current value of the hubble parameter by assuming the gaussian prior @xmath61 km / s / mpc , in agreement with the final results of the hst _ key _ project @xcite .",
    "in figure 1a we show the evolution of the hubble parameter with redshift for the two best - fit values for @xmath3 and @xmath52 discussed in this paper , as well as the prediction from the standard @xmath62cdm model ( @xmath63 ) .",

    "we have included a component of radiation @xmath70 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the best - fit point is not representative from the statistical point of view , given the weak power of constraining shown in the figure .",
    "note also that , similarly to some results in the metric formalism @xcite , for these specific values of the @xmath3 and @xmath52 parameters , there is no matter - dominated era followed by an accelerated expansion .      in @xcite it was shown that when the measurements of sne ia luminosity distances are combined with information concerning the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) peak ( measured from the correlation function of luminous red galaxies ) and the cmb shift parameter ( which relates the angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface with the angular scale of the first acoustic peak in the cmb power spectrum ) , the constraining power of the fit to @xmath0 paramenters is greatly improved .",

    "we have performed consistency checks and tested the cosmological viability for a theory of this type by using current determinations of the hubble parameter at different redshifts obtained from differential ages techniques .",
    "the use of these data to constrain cosmological models is interesting because , differently from distance measurements , the hubble parameter is not integrated over .",
    "this means that the differential age method is less sensitive to systematic errors than the standard distance methods .",
    "we find that the determinations of @xmath1 , when combined with the bao and cmb shift parameter , lead to constraints competitive to those achieved with sne ia _ gold _ and snls data , as given by @xcite .",
    "the frw cosmology corresponding to the best - fit solution for a combined @xmath1+bao+cmb @xmath54 minimization presents all three last phases of the universe evolution , namely , radiation era , matter era and a phase of acceleration at late times .",
    "we emphasize that a great improvement on the @xmath1 measurements is necessary for the differential age technique to provide strong additional constraints on cosmological parameters such as those coming from sne ia , cmb and lss data .",
    "as we have shown , the combination of 200 determinations of @xmath1 at a 15% accuracy level ( as expected from the act project ) with bao and cmb shift parameters was shown to provide constraints on @xmath0 variables similar to the ones already obtained with the current @xmath1 measurements ."
