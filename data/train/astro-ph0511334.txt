    "this emission is produce by vertical motions ( inflow and outflow ) combined with thickness and lag .",

    "this shows that the amount of inflow required by the data is very large .    in conclusion , combining the results for ngc891 and ngc2403 ,",
    "the only promising model is the one with vertical - inflow and a second passage because the radial - inflow model produces fast rotating extra - planar gas and the model without second passage shows outflow instead of inflow .",
    "however , even this vertical - inflow model does not produce as much lag ( for ngc891 ) and inflow ( ngc2403 ) as the data require .",
    "hence , we conclude that selecting portions of the particle orbits does not make it possible to reproduce the data with the fountain model . there is an intrinsic need for low angular momentum and radially infalling material that is not present in a pure galactic - fountain scheme .",
    "@xcite suggested that the extended hi  discs of galaxies might be built up from gas that is shot out from interior , star - forming regions and later settles to circular orbits of large radius .",
    "this proposal requires some ejected gas to acquire significant extra angular momentum per unit mass about the galaxy s symmetry axis , @xmath114 , as it is expelled from the star - forming region .",
    "we have found that the observations require the outflow to be narrowly collimated upwards , and in this case none of the ejected gas will increase its @xmath114 to the large values required for formation of an extended hi  disc .",
    "hence our work effectively rules out this proposal .",
    "our phase - change models are essentially variants of the classic galactic - fountain model of @xcite . in that model ,",
    "star - formation in the disc drives a hot wind that cools as it rises , with the result that clouds of hi  eventually form in it , and fall back to the disc .",
    "the main difference between our model and bregman s is that in the latter a pressure gradient in the coronal gas steadily accelerates the gas over a significant distance , while in our calculations the gas is abruptly accelerated within the disc and subsequently coasts under gravity .",
    "crucially , in both models the specific angular momentum @xmath114 of gas is conserved in the flow because the dynamics is axisymmetric .",
    "consequently , in both models the rotation speed of gas at cylindrical radius @xmath16 will be @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the radius from which the gas was shot upwards .",
    "it follows that in bregman s model , as in ours , the rotational lag of the halo gas is likely to to be too small .",
    "our work closely resembles that of @xcite , who also considered the dynamics of ballistic gas clouds .",
    "a difference in the coding is that we integrate orbits in the @xmath7 plane and then uniformly distribute them in azimuth .",
    "this allows us to have a larger number of `` particles '' with a limited number of integrations , drastically reducing discreteness noise .",
    "however , the main difference between our work and that of @xcite is in the comparison with the data .",

    "extracted average projected velocities from the models , and compared them with the mean velocities of ionized gas derived from h@xmath3  long - slit observations of ngc5775 and ngc891 .",

    ".  has been recently revised by @xcite , who applied the same ballistic model of @xcite to fabry - perot observations of ngc5775 .",
    "they found that the vertical gradient in rotation velocity predicted by the model is shallower than that measured from the data , in agreement with our results .",
    "finally , we stress that the distinctive feature of the work presented here is that we attempt to reproduce directly the whole hi  data - cube of a galaxy .",
    "our models are constructed to match the raw data without performing any data analysis , and this procedure assures a full control of projection and resolution effects .",
    "we have presented a model for the dynamics of the neutral gas outside the plane of spiral galaxies ( extra - planar gas ) .",
    "we have explored the role of internal ( stellar activity ) processes in the formation and maintenance of the gaseous halo . in our model , we have considered orbits of particles expelled from the disc by supernova explosions and have integrated their paths through the halo .",
    "we have generated output pseudo - data cubes and compared them with the data of two galaxies with a large amount of extra - planar gas ( ngc891 and ngc2403 ) .",
    "the main results are :    the vertical gas distribution in ngc891 is well reproduced by the models with characteristic kick velocities @xmath117 ;    the same characteristic kick velocity also reproduces accurately the distribution and lag of the extra - planar gas in ngc2403 ( as seen in the p - v plot along the major axis ) ;    we were able to constrain the opening half - angle of the upward flow for a typical superbubble chimney to be @xmath118 ;    the energy input required to maintain the gaseous haloes in the two galaxies is @xmath119 percent of the energy released by supernovae ;    the actual shape of the galactic potential plays a minimal role in the dynamics of the extra - planar gas ;    the main problem with our model it that it produces only half the required lag of the extra - planar gas in ngc891 , so there is a need for low angular momentum material ( loss of angular momentum ) to reconcile the models with the data ;    a second problem is that our model predicts an outflow of the extra - planar gas whilst , in ngc2403 , the data indicate an inflow ;    high velocity massive substructures , observed in ngc2403 and in ngc891 , are difficult to obtain in a fountain model and may be the signature of accretion from igm .    allowing the clouds to be invisible ( ionised ) for the outflowing part of their orbits does not solve the main problems of the models",
    "we have seen how our fountain model is able to reproduce accurately some features of the extra - planar gas ( such as its vertical distribution ) and it is energetically consistent .",
    "however it has two main failures that clearly indicate that a ( collision - less ) fountain alone can not fully account for the dynamics of the extra - planar gas .",
    "the need for low angular momentum material seems to suggest that one has to take into account interactions between the fountain flow and a hot gaseous halo and/or accretion material .",
    "the latter possibility seems particularly attractive .",
    "the accretion of material with low angular momentum ( zero on average ) that interacts with the fountain gas may cause the loss of angular momentum necessary to reproduce the lag observed in ngc891 .",
    "moreover it may add the component of inflow velocity to the extra - planar gas needed to reconcile the predictions of the models with the observed inflow in ngc2403 .",
    "this possibility will be explored in a forthcoming paper .    finally , another topic to pursue is that of our galaxy .",
    "the features detected in ngc891 and other external galaxies are very likely to be the analogous of the intermediate and high velocity clouds ( ivcs and hvcs ) of the milky way . in the milky way we have very detailed information about the kinematics of these features , in particular their inflow motion @xcite , but also about their metallicity",
    "that , in the case of complex c , has been found to be of @xmath120 solar @xcite .",
    "such a metallicity , intermediate between a primordial value and a galactic ( roughly solar ) value , may indicate a mixing process between disc ( fountain ) gas and the accretion material .",

    "<S> recent hi  observations reveal that the discs of spiral galaxies are surrounded by extended gaseous haloes . </S>",
    "<S> this _ extra - planar _ gas reaches large distances ( several kpc ) from the disc and shows peculiar kinematics ( low rotation and inflow ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have modelled the extra - planar gas as a continuous flow of material from the disc of a spiral galaxy into its halo region . </S>",
    "<S> the output of our models are pseudo - data cubes that can be directly compared to the hi  data . </S>",
    "<S> we have applied these models to two spiral galaxies ( ngc891 and ngc2403 ) known to have a substantial amount of extra - planar gas . </S>",
    "<S> our models are able to reproduce accurately the vertical distribution of extra - planar gas for an energy input corresponding to a small fraction ( @xmath04 % ) of the energy released by supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> however they fail in two important aspects : 1 ) they do not reproduce the right gradient in rotation velocity ; 2 ) they predict a general outflow of the extra - planar gas , contrary to what is observed . </S>",
    "<S> we show that neither of these difficulties can be removed if clouds are ionized and invisible at 21@xmath1 cm as they leave the disc but become visible at some point on their orbits . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that these failures indicate the need for accreted material from the igm that could provide the low angular momentum and inflow required .    </S>",
