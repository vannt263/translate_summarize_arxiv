    "real networks are often not isolated entities but instead can be considered constituents of larger systems , called multiplexes or multilayer networks  @xcite .",
    "examples can be found everywhere .",
    "the most classical one is the multiplex consisting of the different social networks that a person may belong to .",
    "other examples include the internet s ipv4 and ipv6 topologies , or the structural and functional networks in the brain .",
    "understanding the relations among the networks comprising a larger multiplex is crucial for understanding the behavior of a wide range of real world systems  @xcite .",
    "however , despite the burst of recent research in studying the properties of multiplex networks , e.g. ,  @xcite , a universal framework describing the relations among the single networks comprising a multiplex , and what implications these relations may have when it comes to applications , remains elusive .    here",
    ", we show that real multiplexes are not random combinations of single network layers . instead",
    ", we find that their constituent networks exhibit strong _ hidden geometric correlations_. these correlations are called  hidden \" as they are not directly observable by looking at each individual network s topology . specifically , each single network can be mapped ( embedded ) into a separate hyperbolic space  @xcite , where node coordinates abstract the _ popularity _ and _ similarity _ of nodes  @xcite .",
    "we find that node coordinates are strongly correlated across layers of real multiplexes , meaning that distances between nodes in the underlying hyperbolic spaces of the constituent networks are also strongly correlated .",
    "the discovered geometric correlations yield a very powerful framework for answering important questions related to real multiplexes .",
    "specifically , we first show that these correlations imply the existence of multidimensional communities , which are sets of nodes that are similar ( close in the underlying space ) in multiple layers , and which we can detect .",
    "further , we show that strong geometric correlations imply accurate trans - layer link prediction , where connections in one layer can be predicted by knowing the hyperbolic distances among nodes in another layer .",
    "this is important for applications where we only know the connections among nodes in one context , e.g. , structural connections between brain regions , and we want to predict connections between the same nodes in some other context , e.g. , likelihood of functional connections between the same brain regions .    finally , we also consider targeted navigation that uses only local knowledge .",
    "targeted navigation is a key function of many real networks , where either goods , people , or information is transferred from a source to a destination using the connections of the network .",
    "it has been shown that single complex networks , like the ipv4 internet or the network of airport connections , can be navigated efficiently by performing _",
    "greedy routing _ in their underlying geometric spaces  @xcite .",
    "in greedy routing , nodes forward a message to their neighbor that is closest to the destination in the geometric space . the message either reaches its target , or it enters a loop , i.e. the message is given back to a node it already visited , and the delivery fails . to study navigation in multilayer systems , we extend the notion of greedy routing so that a node forwards a message to its neighbor that is closest to the destination in any of the layers comprising the system .",
    "we call this process",
    "_ mutual greedy routing_.    mutual greedy routing follows the same line of reasoning as greedy routing in milgram s experiment  @xcite .",
    "for example , in the case of a single network , to reach a lawyer in boston one might want to forward a message to a judge in los angeles ( greedy routing ) .",
    "however , in the case of two network layers , it might be known that the lawyer in boston is also a passionate vintage model train collector .",
    "an individual who knows a judge in los angeles and the owner of a vintage model train shop in new york , who might be attending all the vintage train meetings , would probably choose to forward the message to the latter ( mutual greedy routing ) . similarly , air travel networks can be supported by train networks to enhance the possibilities to navigate the physical world , individuals can use different online social networks to increase their outreach , and so on . in this work ,",
    "we consider the real internet , which is used to navigate the digital world , and show that mutual greedy routing in the multiplex consisting of the ipv4 and ipv6 internet topologies  @xcite outperforms greedy routing in the single ipv4 and ipv6 networks .",
    "we also use synthetic model networks to show that geometric correlations improve the navigation of multilayer systems , which outperforms navigation in the single layers if these correlations are sufficiently strong . in this context",
    ", we also investigate under which conditions adding more layers improves the navigability of a multilayer system .",
    "it has been shown that many real ( single layer ) complex networks have an effective or hidden geometry underneath their observed topologies , which is hyperbolic rather than euclidean  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we extend the hidden geometry paradigm to real multiplexes and prove that the coordinates of nodes in the different underlying spaces of layers are correlated .",
    "nodes of real single - layered networks can be mapped to points in the hyperbolic plane , such that each node @xmath0 has the polar coordinates , or hidden variables , @xmath1 .",
    "the radial coordinate @xmath2 abstracts the node popularity .",
    "the smaller the radial coordinate of a node , the more popular the node is , and the more likely it attracts connections .",
    "the angular distance between two nodes , @xmath3 , abstracts their similarity .",
    "the smaller this distance , the more similar two nodes are , and the more likely they are connected .",
    "the hyperbolic distance between two nodes , very well approximated by @xmath4  @xcite , is then a single - metric representation of a combination of the two attractiveness attributes , radial popularity and angular similarity .",
    "the smaller the hyperbolic distance between two nodes , the higher is the probability that the nodes are connected , meaning that connections take place by optimizing trade - offs between popularity and similarity  @xcite .",
    "techniques based on maximum likelihood estimation for inferring the popularity and similarity node coordinates in a real network have been derived in  @xcite and recently optimized in  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that through the constructed hyperbolic maps one can identify soft communities of nodes , which are groups of nodes located close to each other in the angular similarity space  @xcite ; predict missing links with high precision  @xcite ; and facilitate efficient greedy routing in the internet , which can reach destinations with more than @xmath5% success rate , following almost shortest network paths  @xcite .       are shown . *",

    "to destroy the geometric trans - layer correlations in our real multiplexes , we randomly reshuffle the trans - layer node - to - node mappings . specifically , for each real multiplex we select one of its layers and we interchange the i d of each node of the layer with the i d of a randomly selected node from the same layer .",
    "the idea behind this process is that if a node with i d @xmath0 is node @xmath24 in layer 1 and node @xmath25 in layer 2 with correlated coordinates @xmath26 , @xmath27 , then , after reshuffling layer 2 , the node will become some other node @xmath28 in this layer , with coordinates @xmath29 that will not be correlated with @xmath26 .",
