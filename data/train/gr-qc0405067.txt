    "the gravitational wave astronomy enters its first step .",
    "the ground - based laser interferometers such as tama300 , ligo and geo600 have already begun operations covering @xmath0 hz  khz band , and virgo will be also in operation soon . the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) @xcite covering @xmath1  @xmath2 hz is expected to be launched in @xmath3 . recently , in addition , the decihertz interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( decigo ) , which aims the frequency band around decihertz ( @xmath2  @xmath0 hz ) , has been proposed @xcite . the decihertz antenna is also considered in the nasa roadmap beyond einstein and is called the big bang observer ( bbo ) @xcite .    it might be possible to construct a practical decigo and bbo with @xmath4 at @xmath5 hz .",
    "although this limiting sensitivity is @xmath6 times less than the ultimate quantum limit @xmath7 at @xmath5 hz for a @xmath8 kg mirror mass , the practical decigo and bbo may achieve the following important results @xcite : ( 1 ) the chirp signals of coalescing binary neutron stars at @xmath9 may be detected with a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) @xmath10 for one year observation .",
    "( 2 ) the time variation of the hubble parameters of our universe may be determined by the chirp signals so that we can directly measure the acceleration of the expansion of the universe .",
    "( 3 ) the stochastic gravitational waves from inflation may be detected if @xmath11 , which is the upper limit from cosmic microwave background .",
    "( 4 ) an arcminute position and an accurate ( @xmath5 s ) coalescence time of the coalescing binary neutron stars at @xmath12 mpc may be determined a week before the final merging , so that the all band electromagnetic detectors can perform the simultaneous follow - up observation .",
    "an accurate position may be also important for the reconstruction of the density distribution and the shape of the galactic dark halo @xcite .    in this paper , we consider gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) as possible sources of the gravitational waves for decigo and bbo .",
    "the grbs are the most luminous objects in the universe .",
    "the recent discovery of the afterglow has revolutionized the understanding of the long duration grbs ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we are now confident that long grbs with @xmath1310s duration eject relativistic flows with lorentz factors @xmath14 and the ejecta is collimated in a jet .",
    "this means that the nonspherical acceleration of a large mass is associated with grbs .",
    "therefore it is guaranteed that the grb jet acceleration emits gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "we will show that the typical frequency of the gravitational waves is about the inverse of the duration of grbs @xmath5 hz , so that the decihertz band of decigo and bbo best suits the detection of gravitational waves from the grb jet (   [ sec : light ] ) .",
    "here we concentrate on the gravitational waves from the acceleration stage of grb jets , while we also expect the gravitational waves from the formation of the central engine of grbs @xcite that could be detected by the ground - based laser interferometers . we know that the accelerated jet exists although we do not know how it is accelerated and what structure it has .",
    "since the jet is accelerated near the central engine where the optical depth is quite large , the electromagnetic probe is useless .",
    "the high - energy neutrinos from grbs ( @xcite ) may provide a indirect probe of the central engine , while the gravitational waves may bring us the direct information of it .",
    "thus the gravitational waves could be an ultimate way to see the acceleration regime .",
    "the gravitational waves from the grb jet have a `` memory '' , that is , the metric perturbation does not return to its original value at the end of the jet acceleration @xcite .",
    "the gravitational wave memory is the change in the transverse - traceless ( tt ) part of the coulomb - type ( @xmath15 ) gravitational field generated by the masses of the system .",
    "these masses could be stars , neutrinos @xcite , gravitons @xcite , and in our case the grb jets .",
    "segalis and ori @xcite analyzed the gravitational wave emitted when an ultrarelativistic blob is ejected from a massive object by using a point mass approximation .",
    "they showed that the gravitational wave emission from such a source is anti - beamed .",
    "this contrasts with the electromagnetic emission , which is beamed into the forward direction .",
    "they also obtained the detectable distance of about 15 mpc and estimated the detection rate of about 1 per year by the advanced ligo , assuming that the total energy of the grbs is about @xmath16 erg and that grbs follow supernovae .    on the other hand , recent studies suggest that the jet structure is essentially important for understanding the grb phenomena @xcite . depending on the viewing angle , the structured jet model might be able to explain the diverse phenomena of grbs , such as short grbs , long grbs , x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) and x - ray rich grbs @xcite . here",
    "xrfs and x - ray rich grbs are fast x - ray transients that are considered to be related to long grbs @xcite .",
    "little is known about short grbs since no afterglow was observed although many suggestions to show the similarity to long grbs exist .",
    "it is difficult to determine the jet structure only by the electromagnetic waves , since the photons are beamed into the forward direction and we can observe only a small angular portion @xmath17 rad of the whole jet . on the other hand , since the gravitational wave emission is anti - beamed , it can be observed at larger viewing angles , so that we can see wider angular portion of the whole jet .",
    "therefore the information carried by the gravitational waves is important to know the jet structure . in this paper",
    "we investigate the gravitational wave from an inhomogeneous jet .",
    "we model the inhomogeneous jet in which multiple sub - jets with a finite opening half - angle are ejected to various directions .",
    "the jet of grbs should not be a single homogeneous one since a single explosion can not produce a variable grb .",
    "we discuss what kind of information is carried by the gravitational wave observed by decigo and bbo .",
    "we also discuss the detectability of such events .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : memory ] , we consider the gravitational wave from a single jet acceleration .",
    "we investigate the angular dependence of the gravitational wave from a jet with a finite opening half - angle . in sec.[sec : light ] , we discuss the gravitational waveform from the grb jet adopting a unified model of the grb proposed by some of authors @xcite . in sec . [ sec : detect ] , we calculate the strain amplitude detected by the gravitational wave detector .",
    "we also evaluate the maximum detectable distance to the grbs for such events by using decigo and bbo . finally , we summarize this paper and discuss our results in sec . [",
    "sec : dis ] .",
    "we use the geometric units @xmath18 and the signature @xmath19 .",
    "in this section we consider the gravitational waves from a single jet acceleration . actually a single explosion can not produce a variable grb .",
    "many jets are to be ejected since the total duration of the burst is usually much longer than the variability timescale @xcite .",
    "many jets case will be discussed in the next section .",
    "first let us remember the generic form of the gravitational wave memory @xcite .",
    "we consider that the system consists of freely moving masses before and after the burst .",
    "then the variation of the metric perturbation ( which is the gravitational wave memory ) is given by @xmath20 here @xmath21 means the difference between before and after the burst , @xmath22 is the mass labeled by @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the distance from the source to the observer , @xmath25 is the velocity of mass @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the lorentz factor of mass @xmath26 , and @xmath28 is the angle between @xmath25 and the direction from the source to the observer .",
    "small latin indices ( @xmath29 ) run over spatial coordinates @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and the quantities @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath28 are measured in the lab frame .",
    "the tt part of @xmath33 is obtained by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the projection operator and @xmath36 is the unit vector from the source to the observer @xcite .",
    "the source quantities are to be evaluated at the retarded time .    the gravitational wave memory of a point mass acceleration is easily calculated from equation ( [ eq : memory ] ) @xcite .",
    "let us consider that a point mass @xmath37 is accelerated to a lorentz factor @xmath38 .",
    "conservation of energy requires that the mass of the accelerated particle is @xmath39 .",
    "we take a coordinate such that the @xmath32 axis is the direction from the source to the observer and @xmath40",
    ". then equation ( [ eq : memory ] ) gives the amplitude of the gravitational wave memory as @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are two polarizations of the gravitational waves , plus and cross modes .",
    "for @xmath44 and @xmath45 , we have latexmath:[\\ ] ] as in the point mass case , the gravitational waveform becomes like a step function , and the rise time of the amplitude is about the time to reach @xmath70 if the energy @xmath50 is conserved .    )",
    "is shown as a function of the viewing angle @xmath61 by solid lines .",
    "we adopt the lorentz factor @xmath71 .",
    "the opening half - angle of the jet is @xmath72 and @xmath73 from top to bottom .",
    "we can see that the amplitude is suppressed in the forward direction @xmath74 .",
    "the amplitude for the point mass in equation ( [ eq : point ] ) is also shown by the dashed line .",
    "clearly the point mass approximation is good when the opening half - angle is smaller than the inverse of the lorentz factor @xmath75 or the viewing angle is larger than the opening half - angle @xmath76 .",
    "the amplitude is normalized by @xmath77.,width=377 ]    in figure  [ fig : angle ] , the amplitude of the gravitational wave memory for the grb jet in equation ( [ eq : jet ] ) is shown as a function of the viewing angle @xmath61 by solid lines .",
    "we adopt the lorentz factor @xmath71 .",
    "the opening half - angle of the jet is @xmath72 and @xmath73 from top to bottom .",
    "we can see that , because of the anti - beaming effect , the amplitude is suppressed in the forward direction , that is , when the viewing angle is smaller than the opening half - angle of the jet @xmath74 .",
    "the amplitude of the memory for the point mass in equation ( [ eq : point ] ) is also shown by the dashed line .",
    "we can find that the point mass is a reasonable approximation of the jet when the opening half - angle is smaller than the inverse of the lorentz factor @xmath75 or the viewing angle is larger than the opening half - angle @xmath76 .",
    "the opening half - angle of the jet is usually small @xmath78 @xcite so that we observe the jet from off - axis direction usually .",
    "this means that the effects of the finite opening angle may not reduce the event rate of the gravitational waves from grbs so much .",
    "the leading model of the grb emission is the internal shock model @xcite .",
    "the internal shock occurs in the relativistic wind when the fast moving flow catches up the slow one .",
    "the wind can be modeled by a succession of relativistic shells .",
    "a collision of two shells produces a single pulse light curve , whose superposition makes a whole light curve .",
    "when the grb ejects many jets , the gravitational waveform from the grb differs from a single step function , but has many steps since linear perturbation is additive .",
    "there are three timescales that determine the temporal structure of the gravitational wave memory of the grb .",
    "the first is the rise time of the gravitational wave amplitude due to a single jet @xmath79 .",
    "as argued in the previous section , @xmath79 is related to the acceleration time of the jet .",
    "the second is the separation between successive jets @xmath80s .",
    "the third is the total duration of the burst @xmath81 , which is about @xmath82 s for long grbs .",
    "then the typical order between three timescales is @xmath83 therefore the typical gravitational waveform should have many steps .",
    "each step corresponds to the ejection of a jet , and the final amplitude of the gravitational wave memory is mainly determined by the total energy of the jets ejected from the grb .",
    "the final amplitude is reached after the total duration @xmath81 .",
    "thus the typical frequency in fourier space of the gravitational waves is expected as @xmath84 this band is just the decihertz band of decigo and bbo .",
    "recently some of authors proposed a unified model of the grbs @xcite . in this model , the central engine of the long and short grbs , xrfs and x - ray rich grbs is the same , and the apparent differences come essentially from different viewing angles .",
    "we assume that the jet of the grb consists of multiple sub - jets .",
    "these sub - jets have angular size of @xmath85 and are distributed within the whole grb jet ( @xmath5 ) . if many sub - jets point to our line of sight , the event looks like a long grb , while if a single sub - jet points to us , it looks like a short grb",
    ". if our line of sight is off - axis to any sub - jets , the event looks like an xrf or x - ray rich grb .",
    "an example of the sub - jet angular distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : dist ] , where @xmath86 sub - jets are ejected for @xmath87 sec and each sub - jet has @xmath71 and @xmath88 rad .",
    "when we observe the source from the @xmath89 axis ( case  `` a '' ) , we see spiky temporal structures ( fig . 3-a ) and may identify the case `` a '' as the long grbs . when the line of sight is away from any sub - jets ( cases  `` b@xmath90 '' and `` b@xmath91 '' ) , soft and dim prompt emission , i.e. xrfs or x - ray rich grbs",
    "are observed ( fig .  3-b@xmath92 , 3-b@xmath93 ) .",
    "if the line of sight is inside an isolated sub - jet ( case  `` c '' ) , its observed pulse duration is much smaller than the case `` a '' ( fig .",
    "3-c ) , so that we may observe the short grb .",
    "the details about the calculations of the x - ray and gamma - ray light curves in figure  [ fig : gamma ] are given in @xcite .",
    "sub - jets confined in the whole grb jet in our simulation .",
    "the whole jet has the opening half - angle of @xmath94  rad , while the sub - jets have @xmath95  rad .",
    "the axes and the angular size of sub - jets are represented by crosses and the dotted circles , respectively .",
    "`` a '' represents the center of the whole jet and is hidden by the lines of sub - jets .",

    "the point mass approximation is good .",
    "since @xmath98 in our case we use the point mass approximation for each sub - jet and neglect the rise time of the amplitude , for simplicity .",
    "each step corresponds to the ejection of a sub - jet , and the whole gravitational waveform has @xmath86 steps .",
    "since the sub - jets are ejected for @xmath87 sec , the final amplitude is reached after the duration @xmath81 .",
    "we find that the final amplitude in case `` a '' is much smaller than the other cases and goes up and down more frequently than the others .",
    "this is because each memory of the sub - jet is proportional to @xmath99 from equation ( [ eq : point ] ) and the distribution of @xmath64 is nearly isotropic for an on - axis observer like case `` a '' so that each memory tends to be canceled . on the other hand , if the viewing angle is large , the distribution of @xmath64 is not isotropic and either of two polarizations dominates the other one",
    ". therefore , the amplitudes in cases `` @xmath100'',``@xmath101 '' and `` c '' increase monotonously .",
    "in addition , their waveforms resemble each other because the gravitational wave emitted by each sub - jet is nearly isotropic @xmath102 for @xmath103 .    comparing the gravitational waveform with the gamma - ray one in figure  [ fig : gamma ]",
    ", we can see that the gravitational wave amplitude is roughly anti - correlated with the photon flux . in case `` a '' , the gamma - ray is strong while the gravitational wave is weak . in cases",
    "`` @xmath100 '' and `` @xmath101 '' ,",
    "the gamma - ray is weak while the gravitational wave is strong so that we may confirm the existence of many off - axis sub - jets which are not identified by the gamma - ray . in case ",
    "c , the gamma - ray is short and strong while the gravitational wave is long and strong .",
    "this means that the gravitational waves carry information on the off - axis jets .",
    "thus , the gravitational waves are indispensable to explore the structure of the jet . for instance , in other models of the xrfs , emission comes from on - axis jets , so that the gravitational wave would have less amplitude . in other words , the gravitational wave can be used to verify or refute models of grbs including our unified model of grbs .",

    "if a grb happens in our galaxy , we can get the information on the high - frequency region @xmath137 .",
    "this may make it possible for us not only to detect the gravitational wave memory , but also to extract important information about the structure of the grb jet from the observed gravitational wave .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the gravitational wave emitted in the acceleration phase of the grb jet . at first",
    ", we have considered the angular distribution of a grb jet with a finite opening half - angle @xmath148 . as a result , we have shown that we can deal with the jet as a point mass if the opening half - angle is smaller than the inverse of the lorentz factor , @xmath56 , or the viewing angle @xmath149 is larger than the opening half - angle .",
    "we have also shown that the gravitational radiation is weak in the angular size @xmath150 .",
    "next , we have considered the waveform of the gravitational wave from the grbs .",
    "we have found that many steps usually appear in the waveform .",
    "this has been explicitly shown for the multiple sub - jet model of grbs .",
    "if we observe the grbs from the front , the observed amplitude of the gravitational wave is suppressed because the wave from each sub - jet tends to cancel one another . on the other hand ,",
    "the amplitude increases monotonously for the off - axis observer .",
    "in addition , we have considered the detectability of grbs by using the practical decigo and bbo .",
    "we have found that we may detect the gravitational wave emitted from the grb jet if it locates within @xmath126 mpc .    since the gravitational wave memory is anti - beamed , almost all grbs detected by the gravitational waves",
    "will be observed with off - axis viewing angle .",
    "the photon emission from such off - axis grbs is softer and dimmer than the on - axis ones due to the relativistic beaming @xcite . therefore the grbs detected by the gravitational wave memory may be observed as xrfs @xcite or rather softer events in the uv / optical bands @xcite .",
    "the prompt electromagnetic emission is too dim to be observed in the case of large viewing angle .",
    "even then , bright radio afterglows can be seen several months after the grb explosion since the relativistic beaming effect becomes weak @xcite .",
    "the association with a bright radio source might help us to identify the signal of the gravitational wave memory .",
    "in addition , the association with supernovae observed in the optical band may be also helpful .",
    "xrfs may be grbs with large viewing angles @xcite .",
    "the gravitational waves will be observed prior to the xrfs with the time delay being longer for softer and dimmer xrfs @xcite .",
    "thus the gravitational waves allow one to test the off - axis grb model for the xrfs .",
    "unfortunately the event rate of the gravitational waves associated with the detectable grbs may be small .",
    "since the true grb rate is estimated as @xmath151 gpc@xmath152 yr@xmath139 @xcite , the event rate within the detectable distance @xmath147 mpc ( see   [ sec : detect ] ) is only @xmath153 yr@xmath139 , that is very small compared with the detection rate of the gravitational wave by the central engine @xcite .",
    "however the gravitational wave event rate without detectable grbs could be much higher .",
    "recently , many observations support a massive stellar origin for the long grb @xcite and it is widely assumed that a massive collapsing star ( `` collapsar '' ) is the progenitor @xcite .",
    "suppose the grb jets have the same total energy .",
    "although the grb jet can not break through the star because of weak collimation or it is baryon - loaded , so that @xmath154 , the resultant gravitational wave may have same amplitude as usual succeeded grbs",
    ". hence the detection rate of such events may be improved .",
    "furthermore we calculate the detection rate for mean events .",
    "however the total energy is distributed around these mean values .",
    "then the detections will be dominated by rare , energetic events .",
    "for instance , even if only @xmath155 events are 10 times more energetic , the detection rate will be increased by @xmath156 , since we can observe 10 times farther events .",
    "even if we take account of the above , the detection rate is @xmath157 yr@xmath139 optimistically .",
    "we need @xmath158 times better sensitivity than that of practical decigo / bbo for the detection rate @xmath147 yr@xmath139 .",
    "the gravitational wave memory does not depend on the form of energy .",
    "for example , even if the jet starts out as a pure poynting flux jet @xcite , the memory is observed in the similar way .",
    "one may also think that the memory is lost if the jet is decelerated , for example , at the internal shock , the external shock and the termination shock inside the massive star .",
    "however at the internal and external shock almost all kinetic energy of the jet goes into the photon emission whose memory also remains .",
    "( in equation ( [ eq : memory ] ) , @xmath50 should be interpreted as the photon energy , and the photon speed @xmath159 must be set to @xmath126 . )",
    "thus the amplitude of the gravitational wave memory does not change so much . at the termination shock between the jet and the massive stellar envelope ,",
    "the kinetic energy may be converted to the neutrino emission @xcite .",
    "since the neutrino also leave the memory , the gravitational wave memory may not be reduced so much as long as the cooling is not severe in the jet head @xcite .",
