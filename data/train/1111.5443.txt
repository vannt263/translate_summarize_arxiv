    "there , it is transformed into chemical energy via charge separation .",
    "antenna complexes are able to transfer excitations to rcs with an efficiency exceeding @xmath0 . for a long time",
    ", it was thought that energy transfer in photosynthetic light - harvesting complexes occurs through classical processes , similar to random walks of the exciton to the rc .",
    "however , surprising evidence of coherent quantum energy transfer has been found recently @xcite .",
    "these findings raise two basic questions . how can coherence be maintained in complex biological systems at room temperature ?",
    "why is quantum coherence relevant to the efficiency of energy transfer ? + the first question has been addressed in @xcite .",
    "we consider here the second one .",
    "it is known that quantum coherence can speed up energy transport through a quantum walk , which can be faster than a classical walk @xcite .",
    "although the relevance of a mechanism similar to dicke superradiance @xcite has been also pointed out in @xcite , we focus here on a different feature of the `` superradiance transition '' ( st ) @xcite .",
    "we show that st is a dominant mechanism in an antenna complex described by discrete energy levels coupled to the rc , modeled here by a sink having a continuum energy spectrum similar to what has been done in @xcite . on the other hand , the effects of the thermal bath lead only to small corrections to the energy transport in the vicinity of maximal efficiency .",
    "the antenna - sink coupling causes the appearance of a resonance width ( inverse of life - time ) and an energy ( lamb ) shift . for weak coupling strength ,",
    "the resonance widths are roughly the same . however",
    ", if the coupling strength reaches a critical value , at which the resonance widths start to overlap , then a segregation of widths builds up . in this regime , almost the entire ( summed up ) decay width is allocated to just a few short - lived `` superradiant states '' , while all other states are long - lived ( and effectively decoupled from the environment ) .",
    "we call this segregation the `` superradiance transition '' .",
    "this effect has been studied using random matrix theory @xcite , in nuclear physics @xcite , for microwave billiards @xcite and in paradigmatic models of coherent quantum transport @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in a realistic model for quantum transport , maximum transmission is achieved at st .",
    "+ in this paper , we focus on transport properties of the fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) complex , found in green sulphur bacteria .",
    "this complex , one of the most studied in the literature @xcite , acts as a conductor for energy transport between the antenna system and the rc .",
    "the fmo complex is a dissipative open quantum system which interacts with the thermal bath provided by the protein environment .",
    "here we take an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian approach @xcite and study the st as a function of the coupling to the rc and the thermal bath , due to phonons .",
    "the phonon bath induces dephasing and dissipation , and we take both effects into account using two different models for the phonon bath .",
    "since st is due to quantum coherence , we address here two main issues : i ) whether its effects can survive in presence of dephasing induced by the phonon bath at room temperature , and ii ) how st depends on the strength of the coupling between the fmo and the rc .",
    "it has been shown recently that maximal transport efficiency for the fmo complex is achieved near a critical coupling to the rc @xcite .",
    "however , so far , the dependence of this critical coupling on the parameters of the fmo and the rc has not been determined .",
    "we compute this critical coupling analytically and show that it corresponds to the st .",
    "we demonstrate that the quantum coherent effect of st , even taking into account dephasing and relaxation , determines the maximal transport efficiency at room temperature . indeed , the st is due to coherent constructive interference between the various paths to the rc , thus enhancing the rate of energy transfer .",
    "finally , with the aid of the non - hermitian hamiltonian approach , we consider a realistic coupling between the fmo complex and the rc , showing that the st determines the optimal distance from the rc to the fmo system .",

    "each subunit acts independently and can be modelled using a tight - binding hamiltonian , @xmath1 here , @xmath2 is the state in which the @xmath3-th site is excited and the others are in the ground state . since the solar energy is very dilute , we limit the description to a single excitation in the complex , as is commonly done in the literature .",

    "this transition occurs at approximately the same value of the coupling for which energy transport efficiency is maximal .",
    "indeed , the superradiance transition is due to coherent constructive interference between the paths to the rc , and this effect enhances the rate of energy transfer .",
    "since the st effect is due to quantum coherence , one might expect that any consequences of st would disappear in the presence of dephasing and relaxation provided by the thermal bath .",
    "on the contrary , we have shown that the effect of superradiance survives in the presence of the thermal bath , and the maximal efficiency only depends weakly on temperature .",
    "we have also estimated the st critical value analytically . for coupling strengths of the fmo system to the rc near the critical one , where the superradiance transition takes place , we obtained average energy transfer times comparable to experimental values ( a few picoseconds ) .",
    "finally , we took into account a realistic coupling scheme between the fmo system and the rc , and derived from the superradiance condition the analytical expression , eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) , for the optimal distance from the rc to the fmo complex .",
    "this analytical expression depends on the density of states in the rc . within a wide range of density of states",
    "the optimal distance which we obtained analytically is approximately a few nanometers and is consistent with available structural data on rc .",
    "note also that eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) is valid for a generic donor - acceptor complex .",
    "our analysis shows that the superradiance mechanism might play an important role in explaining the efficiency of quantum transport in photosynthetic light - harvesting systems and in engineering artificial light harvesting systems .     _",
