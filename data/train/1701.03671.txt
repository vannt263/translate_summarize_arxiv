    "these active agents are ubiquitous in nature and include bacteria  @xcite , algae  @xcite , unicellular protozoa  @xcite or spermatozoa  @xcite , that move due to a single or an array of flagella pushed by molecular motors . only recently",
    ", artificial active particles have been synthesized and are self - propelled by either biomimetic motors  @xcite , or due to the response of their patterned surface to chemical or temperature gradients , thereby converting chemical energy into directed motion  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they also move in crowded media and their effective swimming speed is strongly determined by the viscoelasticity and geometrical constraints of the surroundings  @xcite .    to capture analytically the intricacies of the propulsion mechanisms ,",
    "simple models for single swimmers have been conceived on different levels of coarse - graining .",
    "microscopic theories for squirmers @xcite , linked - bead swimmers @xcite , self - thermophoresis @xcite , and , self - diffusiophoresis  @xcite of janus particles have been elaborated and include the full hydrodynamic flow . on a larger scale ,",
    "effective models for individual self - propelled particles ignoring hydrodynamics and the origin of the swimming motion are used to describe the stochastic motion and the dynamic behavior . there , the dynamics is modeled in terms of non - equilibrium langevin equations  @xcite such that the noise strength is an effective parameter unrelated to the temperature of the environment , in striking contrast to the fluctuation - dissipation theorem for equilibrium dynamics . in particular , these equations of motion serve as a suitable starting point for simulations  @xcite .",
    "the complexity of these transport properties has often been quantified experimentally and in simulations in terms of low - order moments of the displacements  @xcite and compared to theoretical models .",
    "for example , generically the mean - square displacement exhibits a regime resembling ballistic motion which directly reflects the persistent swimming . only at longer times",
    "the motion becomes randomized and the mean - square displacement increases as anticipated from conventional diffusion .",
    "higher moments can be derived @xcite in principle from the stochastic equtions of motion , yet the calculations become more and more cumbersome with increasing order .",
    "however , these low - order moments provide only restricted information on the statistical properties of the random displacements as a function of time , in particular , they are to a large extend insensitive to the shape of the probability distribution .",
    "more general spatio - temporal information is encoded in the intermediate scattering function @xmath0 , which resolves the motion of the particle at lag - time @xmath1 on a length scale @xmath2 , and is directly measurable in scattering experiments  @xcite such as dynamic light scattering .",
    "the same quantity can be obtained by advanced image analysis within the recently developed differential dynamic microscopy ( ddm )  @xcite , which provides direct access to the relevant length scales of active particles .",
    "of course , single - particle tracking also collects the full statistical information and the intermediate scattering function can be obtained from this information , yet often the temporal resolution is not high enough to monitor the dynamics on small length scales .",
    "last , the intermediate scattering function can also be viewed as the characteristic function  @xcite of the random displacements , which is equivalent to the full probability distribution . in particular ,",
    "the moments of the displacements are encoded as derivatives with respect to the wavenumber .",
    "theoretical approaches to the intermediate scattering function for active particles are rare @xcite and no exact solutions appear to be available .",
    "we assume the active brownian particle to move at constant velocity @xmath3 along its instantaneous orientation @xmath4 subject to random fluctuations determined by the rotational diffusion coefficient @xmath5 .",

    "let us emphasize that if the stratonovich interpretation is used , the drift term in the equation for the orientation needs to be dropped .",
    "the model contains two dimensionless parameters , first the translational anisotropy @xmath17 relative to the mean diffusion coefficient @xmath18 . for passive rod - like particles in the limit of very large aspect ratio",
    "hydrodynamic suggests @xmath19",
    "@xcite , such that @xmath20 . here",
    "we consider @xmath6 and @xmath7 as effective parameters quantifying the noise only , and the anisotropy can take arbitrary values in @xmath21 .",

    "averaging over the directions of @xmath47 yields the equivalent representation @xmath50 and the expansion of the isf for small wavenumbers @xmath51 allows one to recover the mean - square displacement @xmath52 and the mean - quartic displacement @xmath53 the equation of motion eq .",
    "( [ eq : pdechar ] ) is reminiscent of a schrdinger equation on the unit sphere and can be solved by separation of variables .",

    "the negative non - gaussian parameter can be traced back to the directed swimming motion , which dominates the translational diffusion of the active agent at these intermediate times .",

    "the non - gaussian parameter has been derived before for two - dimensional isotropic swimmers  @xcite by a truncated mode expansion of the fokker - planck equation . yet , for isotropic diffusion the non - gaussian parameter remains negative for all times , in contrast to experimental observations  @xcite .",
    "the mode expansion also yields approximate expressions for the isf which in principle also display oscillations in time for the two - dimensional case",
    ".    in differential dynamic microscopy experiments for dilute suspensions of _ e. coli _ bacteria in three dimensions an oscillatory behavior for the isf has been observed and analyzed approximately in terms of pure persistent swimming motion  @xcite .",
    "our results predict that these oscillations fade out for large as well as small wavenumbers which should in principle be also measurable in the set - up .",
    "the motility parameters then can be extracted from the measured isf relying on different wavenumbers .",
    "the dynamics on small length scales is dominated by translational diffusion , at intermediate ones by the swimming motion , and , finally at large length scales by the rotational diffusion .",
    "furthermore the spatio - temporal information obtained from the isf allows to discriminate quantitatively the dynamics of different swimming behaviors , whereas the mean - square displacement of several models such as simple run - and - tumble motion  @xcite is hardly distinguishable to that of an active brownian particle .    the analytic solution for the active brownian swimmer derived here should serve as a reference for more complex swimming behavior .",

    "<S> various challenges are faced when animalcules such as bacteria , protozoa , algae , or sperms move autonomously in aqueous media at low reynolds number . </S>",
    "<S> these active agents are subject to strong stochastic fluctuations , that compete with the directed motion . </S>",
    "<S> so far most studies consider the lowest order moments of the displacements only , while more general spatio - temporal information on the stochastic motion is provided in scattering experiments . here </S>",
    "<S> we derive analytically exact expressions for the directly measurable intermediate scattering function for a mesoscopic model of a single , anisotropic active brownian particle in three dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the mean - square displacement and the non - gaussian parameter of the stochastic process are obtained as derivatives of the intermediate scattering function . </S>",
    "<S> these display different temporal regimes dominated by effective diffusion and directed motion due to the interplay of translational and rotational diffusion which is rationalized within the theory . </S>",
    "<S> the most prominent feature of the intermediate scattering function is an oscillatory behavior at intermediate wavenumbers reflecting the persistent swimming motion , whereas at small length scales bare translational and at large length scales an enhanced effective diffusion emerges . </S>",
    "<S> we anticipate that our characterization of the motion of active agents will serve as a reference for more realistic models and experimental observations . </S>"
