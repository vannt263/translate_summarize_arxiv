    ", we are looking for the probability that random walks from @xmath5 to @xmath6 do not touch other points @xmath7 .",
    "of course , the distribution @xmath3 depends on @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "this problem has been solved exactly for some particular surfaces .",
    "for instance , the case of a planar surface in 2d ( an ordinary straight line ) is described in any book on probability theory ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "its generalization for @xmath0-dimensional hyperplane is also simple ( for example , see the end of section 2 ) .",
    "note that exact solutions have been found only for some particular surfaces but not in the general case . in the general case , the asymptotic behavior is widely studied , @xcite .",
    "problems of the hitting probabilities do not only have a purely mathematical interest .",
    "they are important for a wide class of physical problems , in particular , for the problems of laplacian transfer across an interface , for instance , diffusion through a membrane , electrod problems , heterogeneous catalysis , etc .",
    "( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for details ) .",
    "indeed , if we are interested in diffusion through a semi - permeable membrane ( points of this membrane can absorb or reflect touching particle with certain probabilities ) , we can write the total probability of absorption by a chosen point of the membrane as a sum of probabilities to be absorbed after 0 , 1 , 2 , etc . reflections ( rigorous formalism is described in @xcite , @xcite ) . here",
    "we face the task to calculate the distribution of hitting probabilities .",
    "note that using this distribution solely for a planar membrane , we have recently obtained some important results about general characteristics of the laplacian transfer across an interface , @xcite . to solve these problems one needs to know the distribution of hitting probabilities for a general surface .",
    "here we propose a method to approximate the distribution of hitting probabilities for a rather general case in 2d .",
    "in the first section we introduce definitions and conditions which are required in what follows . in the second section",
    "we briefly describe a well - known case of the hitting probabilities on a horizontal axis .",
    "main results are contained in the third section .",

    "let us briefly discuss this definition .",
    "the second condition allows to simplify all calculations and formulae , but it does not seem to be essential ( see section 5 ) . note that this assumption can be viewed as _ a regularity condition _ for the surface in continuous case : @xmath14 .    on the contrary",
    ", the third condition is important .",
    "it tells us that the surface in question is a finite `` perturbation '' of a planar surface ( line ) . in other words ,",

    "moreover , it is important that both tails lie on the same height ( which is chosen as @xmath15 ) .",
    "this feature will allow to obtain an approximate distribution of hitting probabilities by using the same ideas as for a planar surface ( see section 2 ) .",

    "numerical analysis shows that this approximation works quite good .",
    "the main conclusion is that we have found an approximate distribution of hitting probabilities for a rather general surface , pending certain conditions .",
    "in particular , one can make use of these results for a further study of the laplacian transfer problems .",
    "now one needs to study the role of conditions which were imposed in the first section . as we said above",
    ", the compactness condition is the most important .",
    "it tells that     the surface has a compact support , i.e. there is only _ finite _ `` perturbation '' of the planar surface ;     the plane `` tails '' have the same height ( zero of the vectical axis ) .",
    "if we want to consider a surface with _ infinite _ support , we can obtain the same results but with an infinity of near - boundary functions .",
    "thus the system ( [ eqn ] ) has infinitely many equations , and we can not proceed any further .",
    "the same difficulty appears if the plane `` tails '' have different height : while we step down from the @xmath95-th level to the level of a lower `` tail '' , we must pass through the level of a higher `` tail '' .",
    "it means that there appears again an infinity of near - boundary functions .",
    "only if we step down from the @xmath95-th level to the zeroth level ( and from the @xmath100-th level to the zeroth level ) , we can avoid the appearance of an infinity of near - boundary functions .",
    "the regularity condition is used to simplify certain expressions .",
    "nevertheless , it does not seem to be restrictive .",
    "normally , to apply the technique of characteristic functions , we enumerate all sites ( points ) of the surface . to simplify the problem",
    ", one can make one of the following assumptions :     either suppose that the surface obeys the regularity condition ;     or be interested in the total hitting probability @xmath265 of points @xmath29 , @xmath266 , ... , @xmath267 ( if we authorize changes of @xmath9 by more than one unit ) .",
    "in other words , we could identify the points of the surface which have the same @xmath4-coordinate .",
    "any of these assumptions allows to enumerate the points of the surface with their @xmath4 coordinate using function @xmath9 . in the first assumption",
    "we consider the surfaces having only one point for each @xmath4 ; in the second assumption the surfaces can have some points with the same @xmath4 , but we are interested in the total probability for each @xmath4 .    in order to generalize the method , one can introduce another _ parametrization _ of the surface .",
    "one possible generalization will be presented in our forthcoming paper .",
    "as we have seen , coefficients @xmath57 play a central role in all calculations of hitting probabilities in 2d . here",
    "we briefly present some useful properties of @xmath57 . in real form ( [ h ] ) becomes , @xmath268 we can write two inequalities for @xmath269 : @xmath270 which can be useful for estimations .",
    "now we are going to calculate the asymptotics of @xmath57 for large @xmath235 . integrating the expression ( [ h1 ] ) by parts four times and using the values of the derivatives @xmath271 at the points @xmath15 and @xmath272 ( see table 1 ) ,",
    "we obtain the asymptotic behaviour @xmath273        table 2 shows values of @xmath57 for small @xmath235 .",
    "the asymptotics of @xmath57 for large @xmath41 is @xmath276 i.e. we obtained the same behaviour as for the brownian motion .",
    "it is quite a reasonable result : if we look on the surface from a remoted point , there is no difference between continuous and discrete cases .      here",
    "we present some properties of coefficients @xmath109 and @xmath130 .",
    "also we prove the formula ( [ cn ] ) . using only the definition ( [ alpha ] )",
    ", we find @xmath277 for any @xmath278 . also using ( [ beta ] ) ,",
    "we have @xmath279    let us prove ( [ cn ] ) . according to ( [ solu ] ) ,",
    "we have @xmath280 now we should simplify the difference in brackets in the last sum .",
    "@xmath281 consider the difference @xmath282",
    ". using the property ( [ property ] ) , we can reduce the index @xmath283 in the first term and @xmath284  in the second term , @xmath285 @xmath286 ( we used the property ( [ property ] ) in the last equality ) .",
    "thus , we can represent ( [ difference ] ) as @xmath287 hence we find the formula ( [ cn ] ) , @xmath288"
