    "observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) provide some of the most compelling support for the currently favored @xmath0cdm , or _ concordance _ , cosmological model .",
    "the concordance framework predicts that the cmb should posses temperature fluctuations which are both statistically isotropic ( i.e. stationary over the celestial sphere ) and gaussian @xcite .",
    "measurements by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite have undergone extensive statistical analysis , much of which has confirmed the concordance model but with some indications of departures that may be significant ; see for example @xcite . more specifically , there is some evidence for hemispherical power asymmetry @xcite and also a cold spot has been identified @xcite .",
    "in other words there is some evidence of an anisotropic universe , i.e. one in which the background cosmology may not be described by the standard friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric .",
    "of course the background cosmology for a non - isotropic universe may still be described by the frw metric , but this would require a non - standard topology which we do not consider in this analysis .",
    "the bianchi classification provides a complete characterization of all the known homogeneous but anisotropic exact solutions to general relativity .",
    "the classification was first proposed by bianchi and later applied to general relativity @xcite .",
    "initial studies used the lack of large - scale asymmetry in the cmb temperature to put strong constraints on the possible bianchi models @xcite .",
    "however , simulations of the cmb from bianchi universes not only show a preferred direction , but models with negative spatial curvature ( such as the types v and vii@xmath1 ) can produce localized features @xcite . so more recently attention has shifted to reproducing a cold spot such as that claimed to exist in the wmap data . initially , type vii@xmath1 was the favored model to best reproduce the anomaly @xcite , and this has subsequently been investigated quite thoroughly @xcite , although more recent work has also looked at the bianchi type v which also produces localized features @xcite .    the most interesting range of anisotropic structures is produced in bianchi types vii@xmath1 , vii@xmath2 and v. these different bianchi types have the effect of focusing and/or twisting the initial quadrupole over time ( see figure [ figbt ] ) . in this paper",
    "we study the behavior of these bianchi models so as to identify characteristics of the radiation fields they produce and develop methods that can be used to identify more general forms of anisotropy . understanding the characteristics identified in these particular cases",
    "will hopefully help us find better and more systematic ways of constraining the level of global symmetry present in the real universe .",
    "note we consider just characteristics observable in the cmb temperature ; we shall return to a study of the polarization radiation component in later work .",
    "we consider two statistical measures of anisotropy in some detail in this paper .",
    "neither of these is entirely new and both have previously been applied to observed cmb maps .",
    "however , the general philosophy behind previous applications of these methods has been simply to look for departures from the ( composite ) null hypothesis of statistical isotropy and gaussianity ( or more recently they have been developed to look at universes with multiply - connected topologies @xcite ) . in other words",
    ", they have been used to construct hypothesis tests with the concordance cosmology but their performance has not hitherto been evaluated on models with built - in anisotropy .",
    "for example , if the concordance model is correct , the _ phases _ of the spherical harmonic coefficients of the cmb should be independently random and uniformly distributed .",
    "recent studies have suggested some deviation from this @xcite but it is not clear whether they indicate global anisotropy or departures from gaussianity , let alone whether these are of cosmic or instrumental origin .",
    "here we examine the use of phase correlations in quantifying the temperature patterns generated in models with known levels of global inhomogeneity .",
    "multipole vectors were first introduced over a century ago @xcite . there have since been attempts to understand the multipole vectors in order to explain the cmb anomalies reported at large angular scales @xcite since is not clear how to quantify and verify such properties from the cmb anomalies in spherical harmonics .",
    "they have been used in a number of studies to show anomalies , such as alignments of multiples @xcite in a similar plane to the axis of evil @xcite .",
    "our aim here is to examine the behavior of the multipole vectors in cases where the form of anisotropy is known _ priori _ in order to assess their potential to act as more general descriptors .",
    "two points are worth making before we continue .",
    "first , any realistic cosmology ( whether of frw or bianchi type ) will possess random fluctuations on top of a smooth background .",
    "if these fluctuations are stationary gaussian then they will add correlated `` noise '' to any signal arising from the background model and will thus hamper the performance of any statistical analysis method , especially at smaller angular scales .",
    "this gaussian `` noise '' ( which is equivalent to stationary gaussian fluctuations , and not to be confused with instrumental noise ) is completely characterized by second - order statistical quantities ( i.e. the power spectrum in harmonic space or the autocorrelation function in pixel space ) .",
    "the statistical descriptors we explore are _ independent _ of the power - spectrum , so adding gaussian noise will not produce any systematic response in them .",
    "we also restrict ourselves to looking at just the large - scale features because the patterns in the temperature maps resulting from the bianchi models is over large scales .",
    "therefore , by looking at large scales only , there is more chance of detecting the anisotropy .",
    "however , it goes without saying we are not claiming that these bianchi models are in themselves complete alternatives to the concordance cosmology .",
    "rather we think of them as representing possible perturbation modes of the frw background .",
    "the layout of this article is as follows . in section [ secpixel ]",
    "we look at pixel distributions of the cmb maps to show how the statistical anisotropy present in these models produces a form of non - gaussianity in the pixel distribution over the celestial sphere .",
    "we then introduce phase correlations in section [ secphase ] to provide characterization of the anisotropy displayed by the models . in section [ secmultipole ]",
    "we look at the behavior of the multipole vectors as characteristics of the anisotropy of the same maps .",
    "finally , section [ secconclu ] summarizes the conclusions .     and vii@xmath1 .",
    "the colour scale is marked in millikelvin .",
    "all the maps started as a quadruple at z = 500 .",
    "the bianchi v map shows a focused feature , the bianchi vii@xmath2 map has a twisted feature and the bianchi vii@xmath1 map has both focusing and twisting in the resulting temperature pattern.,title=\"fig:\",width=219 ]   and vii@xmath1 .",

    "the bianchi v map shows a focused feature , the bianchi vii@xmath2 map has a twisted feature and the bianchi vii@xmath1 map has both focusing and twisting in the resulting temperature pattern.,title=\"fig:\",width=219 ]   and vii@xmath1 .",

    "the bianchi v map shows a focused feature , the bianchi vii@xmath2 map has a twisted feature and the bianchi vii@xmath1 map has both focusing and twisting in the resulting temperature pattern.,title=\"fig:\",width=219 ] .",
    "@xcite discussed how localized features in the cmb temperature pattern , perhaps similar to the cold spot observed in the wmap data @xcite , can be generated in models with negative spatial curvature , i.e. bianchi types v and vii@xmath3 . in the standard cosmological framework the temperature fluctuations are described by a gaussian random process over the sky , so a feature like the cold spot corresponds to an extreme event in the tail of the distribution of fluctuations . in a bianchi model , however , it is not stochastic at all but produced _ coherently _ as a result of the geometry of the space - time .",
    "clearly we need a systematic way to characterize the relationship between rare events like this and their origin through either non - gaussianity or global anisotropy .",
    "analysis of the temperature patterns using standard descriptors in non - standard scenarios will produce signals different from what one would see in the presence of stationary gaussian noise . to illustrate this issue we study the pixel distribution function of temperature values .",
    "this is an obvious way to test for non - gaussianity in a random field of temperature values , but a coherent fluctuation field also possesses a one - point distribution that yields some diagnostic information . in this sense , all the bianchi models are inherently non - gaussian but their non - gaussianity is simply a manifestation of the presence of anisotropy .",
    "we calculated the pixel distribution function , which is simply a frequency count of the pixel ( or temperature ) values , for each of the bianchi maps and used it to plot the histogram seen in figure [ pdf0 ] .",
    "a perfectly homogeneous and isotropic map , such as that predicted by the concordance model , would have a constant value over the whole map - remember we are considering maps without fluctuations - and therefore a histogram of the pixel distribution histogram for this map would give a delta function at the mean .",
    "our results show some deviation from this prediction . in figure [ pdf0 ]",
    "we see the plots for the bianchi v and vii@xmath1 types have strongly peaked features at the mean , but still with some non zero variance ; the type vii@xmath2 model has a nearly uniform distribution across the whole temperature range .",
    "although not demonstrated in this diagram , another point to note is that at early times the histograms of the pixel distribution functions of the three different bianchi types are almost identical ; the different values of the temperature pixels are roughly even over the range .",
    "as redshift decreases , the temperature patterns for bianchi v and vii@xmath1 gradually start to focus ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and their histograms of the pixel distribution functions become successively more peaked . for the bianchi type",
    "vii@xmath2 the temperature pattern just twists , reorganizing the pattern on the sky while the histogram stays roughly the same .",
    "these observations help to explain the features in the histograms .",
    "as the temperature patterns become more focused , more of the rest of the map becomes uniform and so the histogram is tending towards a delta function .    in summary",
    ", what we would hope to discover from the pixel distribution histogram is that it gives us some clues about the homogeneity and isotropy of the maps i.e. the degree of concentration around the mean might tells us about the homogeneity of the parameters or the asymmetry of the distribution might give information about the anisotropy . but as it stands , the information from the pixel distribution function is not that clear . all we can say is that the histograms differ from a delta function , so the maps are not perfectly homogeneous and isotropic , and that the histograms are clearly non - gaussian in shape .",
    "however the shape of this one - point pixel distribution does not furnish us with a complete description of the pattern because it does not take into angular correlations between the pixels .    , and green for vii@xmath2 .",
    "the plot shows that the bianchi v and vii@xmath1 types have strongly peaked features at the mean , whereas the type vii@xmath2 has a nearly uniform distribution across the temperature range . ]",
    "we now move on from pixel distributions to consider the spherical harmonics of the temperature maps , or more specifically the phases of the spherical harmonic coefficients .",
    "the temperature of the cmb , @xmath4 , is defined on a sphere where @xmath5 $ ] and @xmath6 $ ] are the polar and azimuthal angles .",
    "therefore one way of describing the temperature anisotropies , @xmath7 , is to extract the corresponding spherical harmonic coefficients ( @xmath8 ) : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the amplitudes and phases of the spherical harmonic coefficients , and @xmath12 are the spherical harmonics which are defined here as : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the associated legendre polynomial .",
    "note that this definition of spherical harmonics includes a phase factor of @xmath15 , also known as the condon - shortley phase .    in the standard cosmological model , the temperature fluctuation field",
    "is produced by stochastic fluctuations which are gaussian and statistically stationary over the celestial sphere . in this case",
    "the phases @xmath11 of each spherical harmonic mode @xmath8 are independent and uniformly random on the interval @xmath16 $ ] @xcite . if instead the temperature pattern on the sky is produced by a bianchi geometry then the @xmath8",
    "are no longer stochastically generated but can be directly calculated from parameters of the model .",
    "analytical forms for the temperature pattern can be used to obtain the spherical harmonic phases @xcite , but it is clumsy to transform these between different coordinate systems @xcite . in the following we therefore obtain distributions of @xmath11 from bianchi maps generated using the method described by @xcite .      to visualize the information held in the phases , @xmath11 , of the spherical harmonic coefficients , @xmath8 , we plotted them over all @xmath17 and @xmath18 . rather than using a 3d plot ,",
    "colour has been used to represent the @xmath11 following @xcite .",
    "the colours equate to the angle on a colour wheel : red ( @xmath19 ) , green ( @xmath20 ) , cyan ( @xmath21 ) , and purple ( @xmath22 ) . to understand these plots , first consider what we would expect to see in the case of an isotropic and homogeneous universe as predicted by the concordance model .",
    "this would be a uniform map ( as we are not at this point considering fluctuations ) but in spherical harmonics this only has power in one mode ( @xmath23 ) , so there is no phase for the other modes .",
    "better to consider a map with gaussian fluctuations as later in the section we will move on to add noise to the bianchi maps .",
    "figure [ figrandom ] shows the phases ( @xmath11 ) for a homogeneous and isotropic map with gaussian fluctuations .",
    "the phases are random over the space i.e. there are no visible patterns in the distribution of colours in the plot . note that for all the maps , @xmath11 = 0 or @xmath24 for @xmath18 = 0 because the @xmath8 coefficients are defined so that @xmath25 .",

    "the dipole vectors lie very near the centre in the early stage but not exactly on it .",
    "however , as time goes on , the dipole vector is overlapped by one of the octopole vectors in the centre .",
    "the dipole vector of bianchi vii@xmath2 type is different from bianchi vii@xmath1 . in the bianchi vii@xmath2 type",
    ", there is no particular correlation between the dipole and other multipoles since the dipole is not coupled with the other multipoles ( quadrupole and octopole ) . for the bianchi",
    "v ( left ) , at the beginning of the stage , the dipole vector is ` almost ' on the z - axis and one of octopole vectors is exactly on the z - axis .",
    "however the two later - time bianchi v cases on the top left of figure [ mvsmaps ] show the dipole and octopole are on the same spot , in the middle of the image , which is exactly on the z - axis",
    ". meanwhile , one of components of quadrupole and octopole vectors are on the same spot on the x - y plan .",
    "this means that the later bianchi v models have more extreme correlation between the multipoles .",
    "again for pedagogical interest , the multipole vectors are applied to the wmap 5 year internal linear combination ( ilc ) map in figure [ figmvwmap ] . at first glance",
    ", the results in the top row look like they might be clustered in a similar way to those in the bianchi models ( see figure [ mvsmaps ] ) .",
    "however when we look at the results in the second row , where the map is orientated in the usual galactic coordinates , we see the multipoles line up along the x - y plane .",
    "this suggests an alternative explanation that the clustering near the x - y plane could be a feature of the residual galactic contamination which is known to remain in the full sky ilc maps .",
    "the aim of this article was to explore some simple ways of characterizing the large - scale temperature patterns in cmb maps generated in anisotropic bianchi type v , vii@xmath1 and vii@xmath2 universes .",
    "the ultimate purpose of investigating this behavior is to find ways of quantifying the global properties of the pattern produced in order to isolate the effect of anisotropy from that of non - gaussianity .",
    "we repeat that when we talk about non - gaussianity here is not related to a stochastic field ; there are no fluctuations in the bianchi maps .",
    "we first discussed perhaps the simplest and perhaps the most obvious possible descriptive statistics , the histogram of the pixel values , primarily with the aim of demonstrating how non - gaussianity of a sort can arise from asymmetry .",
    "we evaluated the pixel distribution functions for each of the maps and compared them to results expected in a universe consistent with the concordance model .",
    "the type vii@xmath2 maps show the strongest deviation from the null hypothesis ; but types v and vii@xmath1 behaved in a similar fashion to each other , and closer to that of the null hypothesis .",
    "the reason these two gave lesser indications of the presence of anomalies was because the focussing effect produces a pattern that covers only a smaller part of the celestial sphere , which tends to get lost when averaged over the whole sky .",
    "this method is therefore useful to characterize coherent signals extended over a large region , such as a spiral pattern , but not if they are concentrated .",
    "phase analysis is a relatively new technique , and has consequently not been used to quantify many alternative situations to the concordance model .",
    "the phases of the spherical harmonic coefficients provide a generic way of looking at correlations in harmonic space that could arise from non - stationarity or non - gaussianity .",
    "while this is a potential strength of the approach - while phase correlations will not just be useful for identifying anisotropies specific to the bianchi models , but in theory any isotropy introduced to the cmb - it could also prove a weakness , in that more general methods may lack the power to discriminate very specific models .",
    "the phase correlations identified in our bianchi maps using this technique were much stronger than we at first expected ; given the generic nature of the metric it was not expected to yield good results . in addition to this , the strong correlations were found to be robust to both rotation and moderate noise .",
    "significant correlations in both twisted and focusing features were also identified . however using the same methods on the wmap 5 year data shows little evidence of non - gaussianity .",
    "given that the diagnostics are identified in harmonic space , it is difficult to say whether any of the anomalies identified this way are down to isotropy or homogeneity .",
    "the analysis of multipole vectors is also a relatively new technique .",
    "it has been used to identify non - gaussianities in the wmap data , and has been particularly successful in identifying anisotropies ( i.e. asymmetries and/or preferred directions ) .",
    "the multipole vectors are calculated from spherical harmonic coefficients which , as we have already shown , themselves provide a very effective way of identifying correlations in bianchi ( and presumably other anisotropic ) patterns .",
    "the multipole vectors must include at least some of the information needed to describe these mode correlations .",
    "the advantage of multipole vectors over the spherical harmonics themselves , however , is that they give results in real ( i.e. pixel ) space which is much more informative to the user .",
    "the results when applied to the bianchi maps show very strong correlations between the directions of the multipole vectors for low @xmath17 , often with them entirely overlapping , and hence showing preferred directions .",
    "since these vectors would not be aligned in the case of a stationary stochastic field over the sky , these results demonstrate that they are sensitive to departures from the standard cosmological model .",
    "it remains the case that the standard cosmological model is a good fit to a huge range of observational data .",
    "nevertheless , it is important that tools are developed that are sufficiently sensitive to hunt efficiently for possible anomalies in the next generation of observations .",
    "there are many ways that the cmb temperature pattern could be anomalous other than through the presence of bianchi perturbation modes such as those we have studied here . just as there are many ways a distribution can be non - gaussian , so are there also many ways a fluctuation field can be non - stationary .",
    "testing for departures from the standard model will require not one but a battery of statistical techniques each sensitive to particular aspects of the distribution .",
    "this has been a very preliminary analysis , aimed at establishing whether the diagnostics described in this paper are _ in principle _ capable of uncovering evidence of underlying anomalies in cmb data .",
    "of course these patterns represent somewhat extreme departures from the standard framework so it is no real surprise that they register strongly in the descriptors used .",
    "however , in all cases our analysis has involved only a relatively small number of quantities , so the fact that we see quantifiable effects emerging is very encouraging .",

    "once the roots @xmath73 are found , the pair of @xmath75 can be expressed in terms of x , y and z. the next step is to find the multipole vectors from equation [ fi0 ] by using @xmath76 or its conjugate @xmath77 since the two points give same result .",
    "we now apply this terminology to the relevant cosmological application , that of temperature patterns on the cmb sky , as follows .",
    "the @xmath78 multipoles , @xmath79 , can be represented by a polynomial @xmath50 on the 2-sphere ( @xmath60 ) , or the product of @xmath61 . by the given relations @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 ,",
    "the spherical harmonics can be expanded as @xmath73 terms .",
    "thus the dipole ( @xmath83 ) , quadrupole ( @xmath84 ) and octopole ( @xmath85 ) can be described in terms of @xmath73 with the @xmath8 as coefficients .",
    "the @xmath8 were calculated using from the maps , and we found the roots @xmath73 which satisfy equations @xmath79=0 for each @xmath17 .",
    "these roots gave a pair of @xmath65 , therefore from equation [ fi0 ] we obtained solution sets @xmath86 which are multipole vectors for each @xmath17 .",
    "for the dipole vector it is not necessary to use the @xmath73 notation since it is a linear equation in @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in our polynomial notation ,",
    "the dipole is also represented as @xmath89 from the normalization , we obtain the multipole vector , @xmath90 and the coefficient , @xmath91 where the c@xmath92 is the angular power spectrum c@xmath93 of the monopole .      in this case",
