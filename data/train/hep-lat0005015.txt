    "<S> we consider the cohomological classification of the 4 + 2-dimensional topological field , which is proposed by lscher , for su(2)@xmath0 @xmath1 u(1)@xmath2 electroweak theory . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence on the admissible abelian gauge field of u(1)@xmath2 is determined through topological argument , with su(2)@xmath0 gauge field fixed as background . </S>",
    "<S> we then show the exact cancellation of the local gauge anomaly of the mixed type su(2)@xmath0@xmath3 @xmath1 u(1)@xmath2 at finite lattice spacing , as well as u(1)@xmath2@xmath4 , using the pseudo reality of su(2)@xmath0 and the anomaly cancellation conditions in the electroweak theory given in terms of the hyper - charges of u(1)@xmath2 . </S>"
