    "this technique , called plasmonic cloaking , is consistent with earlier works that have speculated how a composite particle combining positive and negative permittivity may provide identically zero scattering in the static limit  @xcite .",
    "recent study of the dynamic case has shown that plasmonic cloaks may suppress not only the dominant dipolar scattering from moderately sized objects , but also higher - order multipolar orders for larger scatterers  @xcite . in this vein",
    ", it is worth stressing that by `` cloaking '' we mean strong , or maximized , scattering reduction over a finite frequency band  not necessarily complete invisibility , since residual scattering orders may always make the scatterer detectable to a certain extent .",
    "still , significant reduction of visibility is achievable with the proper plasmonic cloak design , as shown in several recent papers  @xcite and as discussed in the following .",
    "plasmonic cloaking has been shown to offer several intriguing properties in a variety of setups .",
    "examples include intrinsic robustness to frequency and design variations  @xcite , straightforward extension to arbitrary collections of objects  @xcite and multi - frequency operation  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the admission of fields inside the cloaked region , peculiar to this technique , may be used to suppress the inherent scattering from receiving antennas and sensing devices , which may open several interesting venues in non - invasive probing and sensing applications  @xcite .",

    "we show that it is indeed possible to find a suitable , robust plasmonic cloaking layer in this scenario , which under suitable conditions may operate over a broad range of incidence angles .",
    "we corroborate these findings with an extensive numerical analysis of finite length and truncation effects in practical cylindrical geometries , studying the overall scattering reduction for different angles of incidence and several design parameters .",

    "a few important points should be highlighted regarding eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fot - gen]-[eq : fot - pec ] ) .",

    "the formulas here have been obtained for completely generic oblique incidence , generalizing the previously published result .",
    "they show that in the long wavelength limit , cloaking conditions are _ unaffected by an arbitrary variation of the angle of incidence_. in this regime , the tm  te polarization cross terms are of second - order ( cf . appendix  [ app ] ) , thus eq .",
    "( [ eq : fot - gen ] ) ensures that an electrically small magnetodielectric cylinder may always be cloaked using its dominant scattering order in the taylor expansion , regardless of the angle of incidence . as in the spherical scenario , these quasi - static formulas split the role of permittivity and permeability between tm and te polarizations .",
    "special attention should be paid to the azimuthally symmetric modes , for which the role of permittivity or permeability is reversed compared to higher - order modes . moreover , again as in the spherical case , the cloaking conditions depend only on the ratio @xmath48 , implying that a thin homogeneous shell may be employed to suppress the relevant scattering orders in this quasi - static scenario .",
    "it should be stressed that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fot - gen]-[eq : fot - pec ] ) may not be met by arbitrary values of the constituent parameters .",
    "rather , they should lie in specific ranges of permittivity , due to the simple physical constraint on geometry @xmath49 .    from a practical standpoint , an electrically thin dielectric cylinder , for which the @xmath37 coefficient is dominant ,",
    "may always be cloaked by a thin shell with @xmath50 . under the first of the conditions in eq .",
    "[ eq : fot - gen ] , most of the scattering may be suppressed , although significantly negative @xmath5 may be required to achieve a very thin shell . by duality",
    ", an electrically thin magnetic cylinder will require @xmath51 .    for such infinite cylinders ,",
    "the cloaking conditions may in general become trickier than in the spherical case , since the azimuthally symmetric cylindrical waves follow special cloaking conditions : they are permittivity - based for zeroth - order when higher order are permeability - based , and vice versa .",
    "this is particularly relevant for the conducting scenario , for which the dominant @xmath37 coefficient may not be canceled at all in the long - wavelength limit ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : fot - pec ] ) ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that it is still possible to suppress scattering in the fully dynamic scenario , since it may always be canceled with its dynamic expression @xmath52 . however , in the long - wavelength limit , the required wave number in the cloak considerably grows , implying that quasi - static considerations such as those used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fot - pec ] ) may not be applied .",
    "however , it is evident that conducting objects are significantly more challenging to cloak for cylinders than spheres  @xcite .",
    "the physical reason for this difference is evidently related to the fact that electrically thin cylinders are _ not _ electrically small objects .",
    "these systems are still infinite in the axial direction ( for this analytical treatment ) , which implies that their scattering may not necessarily be small  above all when conduction currents may be induced in the @xmath12 direction , as with the tm@xmath53 cylindrical wave .      to assess the validity of the previous approximate cloaking conditions in the fully dynamic scattering problem , we present some numerical examples of interest in this section , solved using the exact analytical theory reported above .",
    "consider first the case of a dielectric cylinder with @xmath54 and normalized diameter @xmath55 , covered by a thin uniform cloaking shell with @xmath56 .",
    "[ fig : th - oblique]a shows the variation of the total scattering efficiency @xmath57 as a function of the cloak permittivity and of the angle of incidence of a tm illuminating plane wave .",
    "it is immediately apparent that the use of negative - permittivity thin cloaks may significantly reduce the overall scattering efficiency of the cylinder , and in particular minimum scattering is obtained very close to the corresponding quasi - static cloaking condition for @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fot - gen ] ) , which would yield @xmath58 .",
    "moreover , minimum scattering is achieved at the same value of negative permittivity , independent of the angle of incidence , consistent with the previous theoretical results , despite some polarization coupling for oblique angles .",
    "overall scattering reduction , compared to no cloak ( @xmath59 ) , is especially significant in the normal incidence case , which provides over 50  db reduction . for oblique incidence ,",
    "the coupling with te coefficients affects the cloaking performance and generates residual scattering at the cloaking condition , but it is seen that the same ( negative ) value of cloak permittivity may provide significant scattering reduction ( over 10 db ) for a wide angular range without drastic changes .    for smaller incidence angles",
    ", we also observe excitation of a plasmonic resonance for slightly negative values of @xmath5 .",
    "this is associated with the condition @xmath60 , obtained here in the quasi - static limit for @xmath61 , consistent with findings on quasi - static plasmonic resonances in layered spheres and cylinders  @xcite .",
    "it is evident that the resonance is not excited at normal incidence , but arises as soon as oblique incidence is considered , due to cross - polarization coupling .",
    "this explains the sharp peak for small negative values of @xmath5 in fig .",
    "[ fig : th - oblique]a",
    ". analogously , for low positive values of @xmath5 , a second small dip in the scattering efficiency appears at @xmath62 , associated with the cloaking condition for @xmath38 = 0 in eq .",

    "all other parameters are kept the same .",
    "the cylinder s scattering efficiency is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : th - oblique]b .",
    "as anticipated above , this configuration gives much weaker scattering in the uncloaked scenario ( @xmath68 ) , due to its small size and lack of dielectric contrast with the background .",
    "in fact , the @xmath37 coefficient is negligible in this case .",
    "residual scattering is dominated by the higher - order @xmath69 coefficient , which may be canceled with @xmath70 or @xmath71 ( note the dual behavior compared to @xmath38 in fig .  [",
    "fig : th - oblique]a ) .",
    "two clear scattering dips are visible around these two values , which also in this scenario do not depend on the angle of incidence , consistent with eq .",
    "[ eq : fot - gen ] .",
    "the absence of scattering from higher - order modes and of coupling for the @xmath21 modes ensures that overall cloak performance is unchanged by variations of the incidence angle @xmath8 , as evidenced by the different curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : th - oblique]b .",
    "it should be stressed that the above numerical analyses neglect ohmic absorption losses in the cloak and/or core materials .",
    "we include these effects in the following sections .",
    "regardless , the plasmonic cloaking technique has been shown to be inherently robust against moderate absorption [ 20 ] , since it is not based on a resonant effect .",
    "this implies that the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : th - oblique ] would remain practically unchanged near the cloaking regions when moderate losses are considered . on the other hand , the large scattering peaks associated with plasmonic resonances would be significantly dampened by realistic losses .",
    "this and the previous considerations imply that :    * the plasmonic cloaking technique may be successfully applied to infinite cylinders . * the quasi - static conditions , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fot - gen]-[eq : fot - pec ] ) , hold to a very good approximation for thin cylinders , @xmath72 , and ensure dramatic scattering reduction in this limit .",
    "* cloaking conditions for electrically thin cylinders are very weakly dependent on @xmath8 .    thus , cloak designs for electrically thin cylinders are robust against the angle of incidence for any scattering order @xmath26 and polarization .",
    "we explore numerically in the following sections how these properties are affected by considering thicker geometries and truncation effects .",
    "for a given infinite cylinder of radius @xmath1 and permittivity @xmath2 , a single - layer plasmonic cloaking shell may be optimized by varying its two design parameters @xmath73 ( or @xmath48 ) and @xmath5 , using the analytical results derived in section  [ sec : anal ] . in general , it is preferable to choose thin shell thicknesses , since drastically increased cross - sections imply reduced bandwidths and larger sensitivities to the design parameters  @xcite .",
    "this simple cloaking design inherently limits the overall total thickness of cylinders that we may cloak , since only few scattering orders may be drastically suppressed independently .",
    "magnetic properties of the cloak  @xcite as well as multi - layer designs  @xcite may be considered to increase the available degrees of freedom and size of objects to be cloaked . in this work , however , for sake of simplicity we limit our interest to non - magnetic cloaks , and we consider moderate cross - sections of the objects to be cloaked . in particular , in the following we consider cylinders with diameters @xmath74 and relative permittivities of 3 and 10 in the dielectric scenario , in addition to a pec cylinder .",
    "since the previous theoretical discussion shows that infinite cylinders may be effectively cloaked , as anticipated , we consider overall lengths l of several times the diameter , which may be comparable to or larger than the wavelength of operation .    because of the tm  te polarization coupling described in the previous section ( cf . also the appendix  [ app ] ) , completely general cloak optimization would be quite complicated , and in general depend on the incidence angle and polarization of excitation .",
    "we choose instead to optimize cloak response at normal incidence  which is usually the angle for which larger scattering is produced  then examine the response at oblique angles with numerical simulations .",
    "more extensive cloak optimization would involve the choice of a cost function and the application of global ( e.g.  genetic algorithms  @xcite ) and local ( e.g.  quasi - newton ) optimization techniques across all angles and polarizations , also as a function of the observer s position .",
    "in general , further optimization may be achieved by considering magnetic cloaks , as discussed above .",
    "we will analyze these aspects in the near future .      to provide insight into the effects of the various parameters involved in cloak design , we examine the variation of scattering efficiency with @xmath48 and @xmath5 for te or tm plane wave normal incidence in the infinite ( 2d ) scenario , using the formulation developed in the previous section . to that end",

    "it is thus best to design for maximal suppression of that polarization .",
    "hence , we focus on tm@xmath11 waves , which dominate scattering from infinite dielectric and conducting cylinders in the long wavelength limit ( cf . quasi - static analysis in the previous section ) .",
    "ideally , the cloak is designed to provide minimized scattering gain for normal incidence .    for our calculations we used mathematica  @xcite and truncated the mie summations at order @xmath78 , which ensured convergence for the cross - sections considered here .",

    "this implies that in the corresponding contour plots there would not be cloaking regions for thin negative - permittivity shells , as in the dielectric scenario .",
    "moderate scattering reduction may be achieved with large-@xmath5 thick shells , but as outlined above this implies large sensitivity to frequency , design variations and closely - spaced resonant peaks , which may be excited at different incidence angles .",
    "it is thus evident that a simple permittivity cloak may not be sufficient to adequately cloak a pec cylinder and , as in the spherical scenario  @xcite , it may require magnetic permeability @xmath6 different from the background for robust scattering reduction . in the following , therefore , we mainly focus our design efforts on dielectric cylinders .",
    "the previous results show that optimal cloak configurations for dielectric cylinders are based on negative permittivity metamaterials and thin cloak shells .",
    "we should point out that negative values of effective permittivity may indeed be achieved in the microwave or thz frequency ranges using various metamaterial geometries , such as wire media or parallel - plate implants  @xcite , and they are naturally available at larger frequencies",

    "table  [ tab : opt ] summarizes an extensive campaign of optimizations that we performed to cloak different cylindrical geometries , as outlined above , considering several cloaking designs .",
    "inspecting table i , we see that thin cylinders ( @xmath94 ) , consistent with the previous quasi - static analysis , require optimized cloaks with negative permittivity in the case of dielectric objects , and a large positive permittivity for conducting materials .",
    "the corresponding scattering gain may become extremely low , since only few mie coefficients effectively contribute to the total scattering , and they are properly canceled by the optimized cloak design . as a general rule of thumb , consistent with the previous considerations , thinner cloaks require larger values of permittivity , either positive or negative .",
    "relatively thicker cloaks relax the requirements on very negative permittivity of the cloak , but , as highlighted above , larger thickness also tends to produce additional scattering terms , which limits overall performance .",
    "however , lower absolute values of negative ( in the case of dielectric ) or positive ( for pec ) permittivity may be easier to achieve and be less sensitive to loss .",
    "a trade - off between cloak thickness , material reliability and overall cloaking performance should be considered .",
    "larger dielectric objects may be cloaked by thicker cloaks with positive values of permittivity , since the dynamic nature of the wave in the cloak may produce a negative polarizability even with positive materials in larger shells .",
    "however , the overall scattering reduction is less dramatic ; residual scattering is indeed expected for larger objects . in particular , as discussed above , conducting cylinders are most challenging to be cloaked against tm waves , due to the axial conduction currents induced on their surface .",
