    "in the accordance with the conventional regge - gribov approach , the one - pomeron contribution to the differential cross section of shdid can be expressed at @xmath25 in the form :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are cms total interaction energy , total cross section , transverse momentum transferred , and invariant masses of final diffractively excited states respectively , @xmath29 is three - pomeron vertex and @xmath30 is the pomeron trajectory ; the parameter @xmath31 is to be chosen to single out diffraction processes from other ones [ 7 ] . since the mean slope of the pomeron trajectory is the only dimensional parameter which can be responsible for the decrease of the function @xmath29 as @xmath32",
    "is increased , the domain where @xmath29 is expected to be nearly constant is estimated as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is an effective mean value of the derivative @xmath35 there which is reasonably evaluated to be @xmath36 .",
    "it is why this domain is expected to be remarkably large , from @xmath37 to @xmath38 or even larger ( it has been observed long ago by comparison of the elastic and single inelastic diffraction differential cross sections that @xmath39 at @xmath40 [ 7 ] , wherefrom , in particular , a rather slow @xmath41-dependence of double inelastic diffraction differential cross section at @xmath42 follows ) .",
    "the double inelastic diffraction is the only type of hadron interaction which is expected to exhibit such slow transverse momentum dependence . at still larger values of squared 4-momentum transferred pomeron is expected to be dissolved to its constituents [ 6 ] that begin to interact independently , so that the `` normal '' qcd regime @xmath43 is to be approached gradually . in",
    "what follows the logarithmic dependence on @xmath41 and rather ambiguous but definitely slow decrease of @xmath44 in the right - hand side of eq.(1 ) are accounted on the average as @xmath45 .",
    "the rough estimate of screening corrections to the one - pomeron shdid scattering amplitude @xmath46 associated with diagrams depicted in fig.3 shows that @xmath47 , @xmath48 being the corrected amplitude .",
    "it is reasonable to adopt @xmath49 and enhance the above correction ( i.e.,to multiply the denominator in eq.(2 ) ) by the phenomenologically approved ( for forward elastic scattering amplitude ) factor about 1.5 , accounting the shadowing by the inelastic intermediate states .",
    "then the corrected shdid amplitude is expected to be @xmath50 and the corresponding differential cross section is @xmath51 after integration of eq.(1 ) over the region @xmath52 one obtains the total cross section of shdid    @xmath53    if one chooses a reasonable values @xmath54 , @xmath55 and the experimental value of @xmath56 , @xmath57 , then the fraction of shdid is expected to be @xmath58 and 0.10 at @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively .",
    "it can be several times less or larger , since the above estimate is rather rough , but its smooth logarithmic threshold - like energy increase is independent of the choice of parameters .",
    "it seems reasonable to expect that hadronization of diffractively excited final states produced by shdid is dominated by mechanism of string rupture as shown in fig.4 , string been formed between scattered colored hadron constituent ( quark , diquark or gluon ) and remnant of the same hadron . any alternative string configuration would be unfavorable since it implies formation of some strings of a very high energy ( it is worthy to mention that diffractively produced state associated with target particle was always out of the game in cosmic ray experiments under discussion because it is never seen within the area of observation ; it is why the projectile inelastic diffraction only is thought of throughout the paper ) . at the same time , transferred momentum @xmath61 is insufficiently large for the fragmentation mechanism of hadronization to prevail .",
    "let us consider the above string in its own cms and adopt that secondary particle rapidity and transverse momentum distributions in pomeron - proton interaction is similar to that in real hadron one at cms energy @xmath62 ( as to the rapidity distribution , it is supported by the well known result of ua4 collaboration [ 8 ] ) . since what is observed is nothing else , than transverse plane projection of the picture which",
    "is resulted from its rupture , it becomes obvious that the typical ratio of a secondary transverse momentum projection normal to reaction plane ( i.e. , to the plane of draft ) to `` transverse momentum string length '' ( i.e. to ls relative transverse momentum of leading particles oppositely directed in string cms ) is about @xmath63 where @xmath64 is mean transverse momentum of secondaries in hadron interactions , and mean leading particle energy is experimentally proved to be about half of incident particle one . at @xmath65",
    "this ratio is about 0.13 .",
    "the only point what remains to be discussed to compare the above consideration to the experimental data is an obvious estimate of the role of atmospheric cascade . since the atmosphere thickness above the altitude where the calorimeter is mounted corresponds to about 3.5 nuclear mean free paths , the probability of at least one shdid collision is about @xmath66 at @xmath67 .",
    "if it does happen , then the subsequent soft collisions can not , most probably , blur essentially the target plane picture it initiates , especially for energy distinguished cores .",
    "it is why the additional assumption suggested by experimenters [ 2 ] seems to be not necessary , that alignment is caused by some peculiarities of the lowest nuclear collision above the chamber only . at the same time ,",
    "the threshold - like dependence of alignment on core energies is associated , may be , with the violating role of nuclear cascade .",
    "thus , the main puzzling experimental features of alignment phenomenon , namely , the fraction of alignment events about ( 20 - 40)% and the ratio of mean value of normal to reaction plane projection of core transverse momentum to maximal value of core relative transverse momenta ( @xmath68 ) ( string `` half - thickness '' to its `` length '' in transverse momentum space ) are compatible qualitatively with the above theoretical consideration ( 30% and 0.13 respectively ) , if one adopts that each core is originated ( due to electromagnetic cascade ) from a hadron created along with string rupture .",
    "the threshold - like dependence of shdid cross section on interaction energy can elucidate why the phenomenon has not been noticed at lower energies ( especially , accounting a poor statistics and other ambiguities of cosmic ray experiments ) .",
    "however , this point as well as some other features of the phenomenon , such as its threshold - like dependence on core energies , core energy distribution , their energy sequence along the alignment line , etc . , needs both the enrichment of statistics and mc simulation of cascade and shdid collisions themselves ( especially , accounting that hadrons of different masses can be produced at the end of string and along its length ) which are in progress .",
    "unfortunately , it is rather questionable , whether an attempt to observe the alignment phenomenon will be undertaken in accelerator experiments soon .",

    "<S> more precisely , at superhigh energies of initial particle ( @xmath0 ) the secondary particle superfamilies detected by deep lead x - ray emulsion chamber appeared to be situated almost along straight line in target plane ( fig.1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the coplanar scattering of such a type was so surprising that an attempt has been made to revise the result but instead they were confirmed with much better confidence level [ 2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the alignment effect for 74 high energy @xmath1-families induced by hadrons above and within the chamber has been carried out . </S>",
    "<S> their energies energies are selected to be @xmath2 ( hadron energies being restored , accounting that the energy of induced @xmath1-family is about @xmath3 of the hadron energy it is originated from ) . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis suggested that superfamily production happened predominantly rather low above the chamber ( at the altitude @xmath4 , since it seemed that nuclear - electromagnetic cascade development would blur alignment , if several interactions contributed ) . </S>",
    "<S> it confirmed a coplanar scattering and scaling - like fragmentation spectrum of energy distinguished cores . </S>",
    "<S> the alignment parameter @xmath5 , @xmath6    is used as the alignment criterion where @xmath7 stands for a number of centers of highest energy and @xmath8 is the angle between the two - dimensional vectors @xmath9 and @xmath10 in target plane , an event being recognized to have alignment , if @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> actually , events with @xmath12 were chosen only because of too high statistical background for @xmath13 and rather poor statistics for @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the threshold - like behavior of the effect has been observed : no alignment at @xmath1-family energies @xmath15 , then its gradual increase within energy range @xmath16 to manifest itself finally in ( 20 - 40)% of total number of events . </S>",
    "<S> 14 events with @xmath17 have been observed , exhibiting most striking alignment structure ( @xmath18 ) . </S>",
    "<S> core transverse momentum @xmath19 was estimated by rough relation @xmath20 , @xmath21 being the distance of a spot from the interaction axis . </S>",
    "<S> the mean ratio of value of maximal relative core transverse momentum to its normal to the alignment line projection ( in target plane ) @xmath22 is @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> no other peculiarities of alignment events compared to `` usual '' cascade have been noticed .    </S>",
    "<S> the first attempt of theoretical consideration of the above alignment phenomenon has been made by f. halzen and d.a . </S>",
    "<S> morris [ 3 ] , whose approach was based on the assumption that semihard gluon jets is a feature of all events at energies above @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that within this approach the cosmic ray observations were associated probably with the jet alignment in three - jet events observed already in the collider experiment [ 4 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> i would like to suggest an alternative treatment which makes it possible to understand many features of cosmic ray alignment observations quite naturally , including the threshold - like energy behavior and fraction in extensive atmospheric showers as well as the typical projections of core transverse momenta to the alignment line and normal to it , and allowing for events with more , than four cores aligned , that have been extracted recently from cosmic ray data [ 5 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the main point of the approach under consideration is that the alignment events are assumed to be associated with semihard double inelastic diffraction ( shdid ) of hadrons [ 6 ] . </S>",
