    "the static part of a spacetime representing the standard , non - spinning vacuum c - metric was originally found by levi - civita in 1917 - 1919 ( see references in @xcite ) but it was only in 1970 when kinnersley and walker @xcite understood , by choosing a better parameterization , that it can be extended so that it represents two black holes uniformly accelerated in opposite directions . the  cause \" of the acceleration is given by nodal ( conical ) singularities (  strings \" or  struts \" ) along the axis of symmetry . by adding an external gravitational field the nodal singularities can be removed @xcite .",
    "if the holes are electrically ( magnetically ) charged the field causing the acceleration can be electric ( magnetic ) @xcite .",
    "these types of generalized c - metric have been recently used in the context of quantum gravity - to describe production of black hole pairs in strong background fields ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite )",
    ".    from the 1980 s several other works analyzed the standard c - metric .",
    "ashtekar and dray @xcite were the first to show that the c - metric admits a conformal completion such that its null infinity admits spherical sections .",
    "bonnor @xcite transformed the vacuum c - metric to a weyl form , in which the metric represents a  spherical particle \" ( in fact the horizon of the black hole ) and a semi - infinite line mass , with a strut holding them apart . by another transformation bonnor",
    "enlarged the spacetime so that it became  dynamic \" , representing two black holes (  spherical particles \" in terminology of @xcite ) uniformly accelerated by a spring joining them . in 1995",
    "cornish and uttley @xcite simplified bonnor s procedure and extended it to the charged case @xcite .",
    "most recently the black - hole uniqueness theorem for the c - metric has been proved @xcite .    in none of the above works",
    ", however , has the basic fact been emphasized that the vacuum c - metric is just one specific example in a large class of asymptotically flat radiative spacetimes with boost - rotation symmetry ( with the boost along the axis of rotational symmetry ) . from a unified point of view , boost - rotation symmetric spacetimes with hypersurface orthogonal axial and boost killing vectors were studied geometrically by bi ' ak and schmidt @xcite .",
    "we refer to this detailed work for rigorous definitions and theorems .",
    "in fact it is no surprise that the c - metric was for a long time analyzed in coordinate systems unsuitable for treating global issues such as the properties of null infinity .",
    "it is algebraically special , and the coordinate systems were adapted to its degenerate character . in polar coordinates @xmath0 the metric of a general boost - rotation symmetric spacetime with hypersurface orthogonal axial and boost killing vectors , z + t [ killvec ]  , has the form ( see @xcite , eq .",

    "the whole structure of the group orbits in boost - rotation symmetric curved spacetimes outside the sources ( or singularities ) is the same as the structure of the orbits generated by the axial and boost killing vectors in minkowski space .",
    "in particular , the boost killing vector ( [ killvec ] ) is timelike in the region @xmath5 .",
    "it is this region which can be transformed to the static weyl form .",
    "physically this corresponds to the transformation to  uniformly accelerated frames \" in which sources are at rest and the fields are time independent .",
    "however , in the other  half \" of the spacetime , @xmath6 (  above the roof \" in the terminology of @xcite ) , the boost killing vector is spacelike so that in this region the metric ( [ bsrotma ] ) is nonstationary . it can be shown that for @xmath7 the metric can be locally transformed into the metric of the einstein - rosen waves .",
    "the radiative properties of the specific boost - rotation symmetric spacetime were investigated long ago @xcite , and for more general metrics in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the boost - rotation symmetric spacetimes were used as tests beds in numerical relativity - see the review @xcite for more details and references .    now in all the work mentioned above it was assumed that the axial and boost killing vectors are hypersurface orthogonal .",
    "recently , bik and pravdov @xcite analyzed symmetries compatible with asymptotic flatness and admitting gravitational and electromagnetic radiation .",
    "they have shown that in axially symmetric electrovacuum spacetimes in which at least locally a smooth null infinity exists , the only second allowable symmetry which admits radiation is the boost symmetry .",
    "the axial and an additional killing vector have _ not _ been assumed to be hypersurface orthogonal . in @xcite",
    "the general functional forms of gravitational and electromagnetic news functions , and of the total mass of asymptotically flat boost - rotation symmetric spacetimes at null infinity have been obtained . however , until now no general theory similar to that given in @xcite in the hypersurface orthogonal case is available for the boost - rotation symmetric spacetimes with killing vectors which are not hypersurface orthogonal .",
    "nevertheless there is one explicitly given metric which can be expected to serve as an example of these spacetimes - the spinning vacuum c - metric .",
    "it was discovered by plebaski and demiaski @xcite in 1976 , studied later by farhoosh and zimmerman @xcite , and very recently briefly discussed by letelier and oliveira @xcite . in none of these works , however , was the boost - rotation character of the spacetime properly analyzed .",
    "in particular ,  the canonical coordinates \" in which the metric represents a generalization of the metric ( [ bsrotma ] ) so that global issues outside the sources could properly be studied have not been found so far .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to find such a representation of the spinning c - metric ( sc - metric ) which would generalize ( [ bsrotma ] ) and , thus , could also serve as a convenient example for building up the general theory of boost - rotation symmetric spacetimes with the killing vectors which are in general not hypersurface orthogonal .    in the next section",
    "we first write the plebaski - demiaski class of metrics @xcite , specialized to the spinning vacuum case , discuss the ranges of parameters entering the metric and indicate the limiting procedure leading to the kerr metric . in section iii the sc - metric is transformed into weyl coordinates .",
    "this is not an easy task , fortunately we succeeded in generalizing the procedure bonnor @xcite used for the standard c - metric without spin .",
    "we show that , by choosing different values of the original plebaski - demiaski coordinates we can , in principle , arrive at various weyl spacetimes .    the properties of killing vectors and of some invariants of the riemann tensor",
    "lead us , in section iv , to choose a physically plausible weyl spacetime which contains both the black - hole and the acceleration horizon .",
    "similarly as has been done with the standard c - metric @xcite , @xcite , we concentrate on this weyl portion . in section v the metric is transformed into the  canonical form \" of boost - rotation symmetric spacetimes with killing vectors which need not be hypersurface orthogonal ( see eqs .",
    "( [ bstvar])-([trel ] ) ) . by analytically continuing the resulting metric across the acceleration horizons (  the roof \" ) ,",
    "two new regions of spacetime arise as in the standard case of the c - metric without spin .",
    "let us emphasize that it is only now , after having described the spacetime in coordinates in which global issues can be addressed , that we are able to fix coordinates @xmath8 , @xmath9 and two killing vectors appropriately . the importance of this fact is briefly discussed in relation to the most recent work @xcite in which a transformation to the canonical form was not performed .",
    "we also show that , analogous to the c - metric without spin , the axis of symmetry contains nodal singularities between the spinning  sources \" ( holes ) which cause the acceleration , and is regular elsewhere ; or the axis can be made regular between the sources but then the nodal singularities extend from each of the sources to infinity ( see fig .",
    "4 a , b ) .    finally ,",
    "in our concluding remarks we briefly compare our results with those obtained recently in @xcite .",
    "we then give two figures , constructed numerically , exhibiting clearly the radiative character of the sc - metric .",
    "a detailed analysis of the radiative properties of the sc - metric and of its analytic extension into the holes interiors will be given elsewhere .",
