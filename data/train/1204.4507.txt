    "region  chemical abundances provide observational constrains that allow to test models of galactic chemical evolution through , for example , the determination of radial abundance gradients in spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , results derived from nebular studies are used in the field of starburst galaxies which , along with other physical properties such as luminosity or the mass - metallicity relation , allow us to study the chemical enrichment of the universe ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is therefore of great importance for these studies to use accurate abundance determinations .",
    "however , there exists an important problem of inconsistency between the abundances determined with recombination lines ( rls ) and those determined with collisionally excited lines ( cels ) assuming homogeneous temperature .",
    "this is usually refered to as the abundance discrepancy factor ( adf ) problem .",
    "arguments in favor of determining abundances from cels with homogeneous temperature are given by @xcite , among others .",
    "arguments in favor of determining abundances from rls are given bellow .",
    "there are two main sets of explanations that have been proposed in the literature to reconcile the abundances from cels and from rls , thus solving the adf problem : ( i ) temperature inhomogeneities within a chemically homogeneous medium , these inhomogeneities would come from shock waves , shadowed regions , advancing ionization fronts , multiple ionizing sources , x - rays , and magnetic reconnection , among others ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) ; and ( ii ) high metallicity inclusion , which also imply temperature inhomogeneities , these inclusions would be surviving gas from supernova remnants that has not fully mixed with the interstellar medium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "both sets of explanations indicate underabundant results when using cels and homogeneous temperature to determine abundances .",
    "one example of temperature inhomogeneities within a chemically homogeneous medium is given in @xcite , where a careful study of 30 doradus was done assuming a chemically homogeneous medium and the obtained abundances were 0.21 dex higher than those obtained using cels and homogeneous temperature .",
    "an example of high metallicity inclusions is given by @xcite , whom created a model for 30 doradus including chemical inhomogeneities that resulted in abundances 0.09 dex lower than those obtained from rls and 0.12 dex higher than abundances obtained from cels and homogeneous temperature .",
    "in favor of the abundances derived from rls is the consistency found in many studies of the chemical evolution of our own galaxy .",
    "abundances derived from  regions  considering the o depletion into dust grains and thermal inhomogeneities @xcite are consistent with : ( i ) the protosolar abundances corrected by 4.5 gyr of chemical evolution @xcite , ( ii ) the abundances of young f and g stars of the solar vicinity @xcite , and ( iii ) the abundances of o and b stars of the orion region @xcite . throughout this paper",
    "we will assume a chemically homogeneous medium and that the abundances are given by rls or by cels and considering the presence of thermal inhomogeneitites .",
    "@xcite first recognized the possibility of including thermal inhomogeneities in studies of photoionized regions ; later on , @xcite studied the magnitude of the effect of such thermal inhomogeneities on the determination of chemical abundances .",
    "these two articles introduced the formalism of temperature inhomogeneities ( @xmath1 ) to determine chemical abundances ; in them , it is found that  region  abundances obtained through the traditional method which involves assuming a homogeneous temperature throughout the whole volume of the object , usually obtained from the [ ] line ratio @xmath3 4363/(4959 + 5007) were underestimated by a factor of approximately 2.5 ( although , the exact @xmath1  value is object dependent and its effect on the abundances is also temperature dependent ) .    with the availability of large telescopes , it has been possible to use the formalism of @xmath1  to study the adf .",
    "several studies have shown that adf typical values are in the 1.5@xmath4-@xmath43 range for most  regions  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in the 1.5@xmath4-@xmath45 range for most planetary nebulae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since cels lead to underestimate abundances when ignoring the presence of temperature inhomogeneities , we consider that abundances determined from rls are more reliable .    for chemically homogeneous objects ,",
    "it is possible to derive accurate abundances from rl ratios ( that are independent of @xmath1 ) , as well as from cels adopting a @xmath1  value .",
    "there are several ways to determine @xmath1  values ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the two most frequently used are : ( i ) from the comparison of abundances derived from [ ] lines with those derived from lines ( this basically indicates what value of @xmath1  is required for cels to reproduce the rl abundances ) and ( ii ) from the comparison of the temperature of forbidden lines to that of the balmer continuum ( this can give accurate o / h abundances without measuring oxygen rls ) .",
    "heavy element rls are particularly faint in low metallicity  regions  such as the ones presented in this paper ; moreover , the balmer discontinuity is smaller and less sensitive at higher temperatures .",
    "there is a third method based on lines which has been previously used and which will be further discussed in this paper . for low metallicity objects , where the oxygen rls are too faint to be measurable and",
    "the balmer discontinuity is very difficult to measure , lines can play a key role in abundance determinations .    unfortunately , there are some  regions  where a precise value of @xmath1  can not be acquired , for instance  galaxies  with high redshift or low intrinsic brightness . in this",
    "scenarios it is important to recognize that , statistically speaking , a good assumption of the value of @xmath2  is much better than assuming that @xmath1=0.00 . for those objects",
    ", it should be possible to use an average @xmath1  value obtained from most of the @xmath1  determinations of  regions  in the literature .",
    "in this paper we derive a value of this average for high and low metallicity  regions , @xmath2 .    in sections [ obs ]  and [ icorr ]  we present the observations of tol  2146@xmath0391  and tol  0357@xmath03915  as well as a description of the reduction procedure .",

    "many of these characteristics are related .",
    "it would seem that for all of these objects there is a strong contribution from either wr or snr .",
    "it would also seem that they have to have several o stars because one single o star in the presence of a wr or a snr would be regarded as a wr nebula or a snr .",
    "table [ twmr ]  also includes 10 type iia and 11 type iib  regions .",
    "typically these objects have in common some of the following characteristics : ( i ) there is no limitation on the number of o stars , ( ii ) for most of the  regions , the star formation activity of o stars started less than three million years ago , ( iii ) for the objects older than three million years , they have a small ratio of wr to o stars ( at least in the observed fraction of the object ) , ( iv ) they do not show vestiges of recent sn explosions ( at least in the observed fraction of the object ) , and ( v ) their bulk gaseous radial motions show a spread smaller than about 100 km s@xmath85 .    for observations that are representative of the whole object ,",
    "the lower degree of ionization of the type iib relative to that of the type iia  regions  is due to the later type of their most massive stars .",
    "this correlates with a smaller number of o stars formed inside type iib  regions . for objects where",
    "only a small fraction of their volume is observed , the degree of ionization also depends on how close the observations are to the ionizing stars .",
    "the @xmath1  values in  regions  are real and have been corroborated by different types of determinations ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "the lack of type iii  regions  implies that , in addition to photoionization from o stars , additional processes affecting the temperature structure of the nebulae have to be taken into account .",
    "shadowed regions behind clumps close to the ionization front , can make a significant contribution to the observed temperature inhomogeneities in the orion nebula @xcite , which is a type ii  region .",
    "it is possible that an additional contribution to the observed temperature inhomogeneities for type ia  regions  might be due to the mass loss processes associated with the formation and evolution of o stars .",

    "the time span for the injection of energy into the ism by these processes is about 2 to 3 million years for an o star , 200 to 300 thousand years for a wr star , and 20 to 30 thousand years for a sn remnant ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . from the time scale of these processes a higher effect on the @xmath1  values",
    "is expected from those objects that at present include wr stars and snrs .",
    "we propose that this is the main reason for the extremely high @xmath1  values in type ia  regions .    in an  region ,",

    "the very small dispersion of type ii  regions , implies that there has to be a series of physical processes present in all  regions , that will produce a typical @xmath1  value of about 0.030 ( considerably larger than those predicted by conventional photoionization models ) .    for type ia  regions  @xmath2@xmath91 with @xmath92 .",
    "the large @xmath1  values of type ia regions show that there should be additional physical processes that are less general than those present in type ii  regions ; moreover , the large dispersion shows that they must have an stochastic nature .",

    "this can be done by obtaining precise measurements of lines , which are two or three orders of magnitude brighter than oxygen rls .    in order to determine values of @xmath1(he@xmath35 ) with an uncertainty of about 0.015@xmath4-@xmath40.020 ,",

    "based on the detailed studies of  regions  with a wide metallicity range , the measured @xmath1  values usually lie between 0.020 and 0.120 .",
    "this range comes from the thermal structure of each region and not from errors in the determinations .    for many galactic and extragalactic  regions  available in the literature neither the oxygen rls nor the lines have good enough s / n to provide a precise value of @xmath1 ; moreover , it is not possible to use any other method to obtain an accurate value of @xmath1 . for these type of objects or observations",
