    "ground - based gravitational wave ( gw ) detectors are traditionally classified into large baseline interferometers and resonant antennas . recently",
    ", a new class of gw detectors has been proposed , based on huge masses kept at cryogenic temperature and called dual detectors  @xcite-@xcite . at difference from previous massive cryogenic antennas ( such as weber bars ) , the dual system do not aim at reaching the best peak sensitivity in a narrow band around a resonance frequency , but it takes advantage of elastic forces to achieve a useful sensitivity in a wide frequency range . for this purpose , it is no longer equipped with resonant mechanical amplifiers , and it needs a very sensitive readout . the goal is realizing a detector which covers the acoustic frequency region ( 1 - 5  khz ) .",
    "a dual gw detector exploits two oscillation modes of a mechanical system with a readout symmetric with respect to the center of mass .",
    "do to the geometry , the responses to the readout force of the two modes must be summed , while the responses to the tidal force of the gw are subtracted . in the frequency region between the two resonance frequencies , the susceptibilities of the two modes",
    "are in anti - phase , giving a reduced response to the readout force and an enhanced response to the gw  @xcite ( back - action reduction ) .",
    "such behavior has been recently verified and explored experimentally in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors study the mechanical response to radiation pressure of a cm - size plano - convex mirror which is part of a high finesse optical cavity .",
    "the internal modes of the mirror analyzed are in the @xmath0  hz frequency and @xmath1  kg mass range .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the back - action reduction mechanism is also the basis for a proposed scheme of quantum non - demolition measurement .",
    "two further important effects are considered in the design of dual : a ) a clever readout geometry allows to be blind to some low - frequency acoustic modes that would bring thermal and back - action noise peaks in the useful frequency range ( ` mode selectivity ' ) ; b ) a broad interrogation area enables to reduce the effect of local deformations due to thermal motion and readout force , i.e. , from a different point of view , the effect of high frequency modes ( wide area readout ) .",
    "different configurations of dual have been proposed and studied : two nested spheres  @xcite , where the relevant modes are the first quadrupolar mode of the inner and outer sphere ; two nested cylinders  @xcite , again acting on the first quadrupolar mode of the nested bodies ; a single hollow cylinder  @xcite , exploiting its first and second quadrupolar modes ; a symmetric set of cylinders  @xcite , where the first dual mode is given by the elastic link between them and the second one by their first oscillation mode .    for any configuration ,",
    "the possibility of an optical readout is extremely useful for its potentiality to reach a detection sensitivity at the standard quantum limit@xcite , or even surpass it@xcite .",
    "an optical scheme expressly conceived for the application in a dual detector is proposed and studied in ref .",
    "the idea is folding a fabry - perot cavity in order to interrogate a large detector area with a beam bouncing several times between the sensing masses , before being reflected back on itself by the end mirror to close the cavity .",
    "such a kind of folded fabry - perot ( ffp ) has never been implemented experimentally .    an interesting possibility for boosting the sensitivity of massive detectors to short bursts",
    "is suggested by vitali _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "they show that , in some conditions , periodic cycles of fast feedback cooling of the sensitive mechanical mode , followed by a measurement period lasting a fraction of the temperature recovery time , brings an improvement of the sensitivity by even an order of magnitude .",
    "cooling of a mechanical oscillator by means of radiation pressure@xcite has been recently demonstrated on micro - resonators using both active techniques ( cold damping)@xcite , with feedback acting on the optical power impinging on the mirror , or passive schemes ( self cooling ) , exploiting the mechanical effect of red - detuned laser radiation  @xcite .",
    "the above results were obtained on effective oscillator masses of less than 1  g , and frequencies in the @xmath2  hz range .",
    "a recent work  @xcite describes the cooling of a gram - size mirror held by a cantilever flexure , with a resonance frequency of @xmath3100  hz . here",
    "the cantilever damping is obtained through a so - called hybrid scheme , exploiting active feedback on the cavity length which actually modifies the radiation pressure exerted by detuned laser radiation .",
    "the cooling effect can be attributed to the optical spring originated by radiation pressure , modified ( with an added reactive component ) by feedback .",
    "a similar hybrid technique is used also by corbitt _",
    "et al._@xcite to cool a suspended @xmath31  g mirror , with the difference that here the detuning is modified by feedback acting on the laser frequency instead of the cavity length .",
    "however , the system explored in ref .",
    "@xcite is very peculiar : the optical spring is so strong that it completely determine the oscillation frequency ( around @xmath31  khz ) and the mirror confinement is provided by the optical potential rather than elastic forces .",
    "a completely different cooling technique has been recently applied to the @xmath4  khz fundamental mode of the 3  tons aluminum bar of the auriga detector@xcite . in that work",
    "the feedback is electrical and is applied to the capacitor of the mechanical readout . starting from a cryostat temperature of 4.2  k ,",
    "the authors obtain a record temperature of 0.17  mk .    due to the innovative dual concept ,",
    "on the one hand a preliminary experimental study on a small - scale prototype is required .",
    "on the other hand , it is important to scale up the experiments on opto - mechanical effects from the microscopic to the macroscopic range of masses and in the khz frequencies , and test the schemes that should be applied to reach the quantum regime of detection . in this work we present the experimental characterization of a prototype of dual detector , composed of two oscillators with a mass of the order of the kg ,",
    "whose distance is read by a high finesse optical cavity .",
    "the mechanical response function is measured by exciting the oscillators through modulated radiation pressure .",
    "we demonstrate two of the above described effects crucial for the dual detectors : a ) the reduction of the contribution of local susceptibility due to average over a large interrogation area .",
    "such effect is measured on the photo - thermal response@xcite thanks to the first implementation of a folded - fabry - perot cavity@xcite ; b ) the back - action reduction due to negative interference between acoustic modes . moreover",
    ", we obtain the active cooling of an oscillation mode through radiation pressure , on our device , which is orders of magnitude heavier than any previously demonstrated radiation - pressure cooled system .",
    "the oscillators are made with two 135  mm wide , 30  mm high aluminum masses ( test masses ) , fixed to frames along their short edge by @xmath3 mm thick lateral membranes .",
    "the first mass is 30  mm thick and 0.33  kg heavy ; the second one is 40  mm thick and 0.44  kg heavy . the two oscillators are carved from single aluminum blocks , whose external parts are kept together by invar spacers and represent the external frames of the structure ( see fig .",
    "( [ foto ] ) ) .",
    "two rows of 12.7  mm diameter mirrors form the ffp : five on one mass , including a flat , 130  ppm transmission input mirror and a 1  m radius end mirror angled by 18@xmath5 , and four flat mirrors on the opposite mass .",
    "the distance between opposite mirror surfaces is @xmath6  mm .",
    "the input mirror is positioned on the outer side of the 30  mm thick mass with respect to the other mirrors of the row , for easier alignment .",
    "the ffp cavity length is @xmath7  mm . due to the non - normal reflections , for each longitudinal mode the s - polarization resonance frequency",
    "is detuned by 6  mhz from the p - polarization resonance ( the mirror coating is optimized for normal incidence ) , with no appreciable linewidth difference . the prototype is placed on a cantilever mechanical suspension in a thermally stabilized vacuum chamber .",
    "the mechanical properties of the two coupled oscillators have been characterized by positioning accelerometers on the two frames and analyzing the response to a global mechanical excitation . a comparison with a finite element method ( fem ) model allows us to identify the peaks corresponding to the translation and torsion modes of the two masses ( their shapes are shown in fig .",
    "( [ spettro ] ) .",
    "in particular , the translation modes are found at @xmath3800  hz ( for the heavier mass ) and @xmath31200  hz ( for the lighter mass ) .",
    "the same fem analysis gives the effective masses of the translation modes , excited and read on a small circular area corresponding to the central mirrors .",
    "the results are respectively 0.31  kg and 0.41  kg , not far from the physical masses .",
    "the experimental set - up for the opto - mechanical characterization of the prototype is sketched in fig .",
    "( [ apparato ] ) .",
    "the light source is a cw nd : yag laser working at 1064  nm .",
    "after a 40  db optical isolator , the laser radiation is split into two beams . on the first one , a resonant electro - optic modulator ( eom1 )",
    "provides phase modulation at 13.3  mhz with a depth of about 1  rad used for the pound - drever - hall@xcite ( pdh ) detection scheme .",
    "the light is then transmitted by a polarization maintaining optical fiber and a second optical isolator ( o.i.1 ) .",
    "the second beam can be shifted in frequency by means of two acousto - optic modulators ( aom ) and modulated in amplitude by an eom ( eom2 ) followed by an optical isolator ( o.i.2 ) .",
    "we use respectively the + 1 and -1 diffracted orders of the aoms , so that the total frequency displacement corresponds to the difference of the aom frequencies and can be tuned by several mhz around zero .",
    "after o.i.2 , part of the second beam is detected by a photodiode ( pd2 ) for monitoring its amplitude modulation .",
    "the two beams are combined with orthogonal polarizations in a polarizing beam - splitter and sent to the folded optical cavity .",
    "a quarter - wave plate allows us to optimize the matching of the polarization to the cavity modes . the reflected first beam , on his back path ,",
    "is deviated by the input polarizer of the o.i.1 and collected by a photodiode ( pd1 ) for the pdh detection .",
    "this pdh signal is used for laser frequency locking , while the second beam is tuned across the resonance using the aoms .",
    "even when both beams are resonant with respect to the respective polarization modes , their frequency splitting allows to eliminate any spurious interference and cross - talk .        the displacement noise spectrum has been obtained directly from the pound - drever signal with the laser weakly locked on the cavity , and stopping the second beam .",
    "the signal is calibrated by modulating the laser frequency through its internal piezoelectric crystal , with a depth and a modulation frequency smaller than the ffp cavity linewidth , and using a phase - sensitive detection on the pdh signal .",
    "the laser piezoelectric crystal is itself calibrated by observing the sidebands at 13.3  mhz on a wide , slow enough scan .",
    "the pdh calibration procedure , performed varying the modulation frequency , allows also to correct the data for the servo loop .    in order to characterize the response of the ffp to variations of the intracavity power ,",
    "the laser is weakly locked on the cavity using the first beam while the second beam is amplitude modulated at different frequencies .",
    "the extraction of the cavity response is obtained again from the pdh signal . the signal from pd2 and pd1",
    "are acquired simultaneously with a digital oscilloscope , and successively elaborated to infer the component synchronous with the modulation .",
    "the depth of the intracavity power modulation is calculated from the signal of pd2 by taking into account the mode matching and the cavity coupling factor .",
    "the latter is inferred from the depth of the dip in the reflected beam when scanning on the resonance , and it is consistent with the independent measurements of cavity finesse and input mirror transmission .    a first important test concerns the optical properties of the ffp configuration , that had not been implemented before .",
    "we could indeed obtain a mode - matching of 93% ( comparable with that obtained with a simple cavity ) and a finesse of 6000 ( linewidth 125  khz ) with an intracavity optical power of the order of 1  w , in agreement with a calculation based on the independently measured losses of the mirrors .",
    "the cavity length noise spectrum evidences the mechanical modes directly coupled to the optical cavity ( i.e. , modes changing the intracavity optical path ) . among them , it is possible to recognize the lower order translation and torsion modes , previously identified in the mechanical characterization of the cavity ( fig .",
    "( [ spettro ] ) ) .",
    "these mechanical resonances emerge from a background given by the free - running laser frequency noise ( in the frequency region of interest , it is approximately @xmath8  hz@xmath9/hz where @xmath10 is the frequency expressed in hz ) .    the vertical scale in fig .",
    "( [ spettro ] ) is expressed in terms of spectral density of variations @xmath11 of the cavity optical length @xmath12 ( measured from the input mirror to the end mirror ) , which are directly inferred from the measured spectrum using the calibration procedure described in the previous section .",
    "for an intuitive understanding , the system can be approximated by infinitely rigid masses linked with mass - less membranes to a still frame . with this scheme ,",
    "the translation modes corresponds to pure translations of the masses on the cavity plane and perpendicularly to the mirror surfaces , as shown by arrows in fig .",
    "( [ apparato ] ) . in this case ,",
    "simple geometrical considerations ( illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ spostamenti ] ) ) lead to the relation @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the ( small ) variation of the distance between the two masses , @xmath11 is the corresponding change in the cavity optical length , and @xmath15 is the incidence angle on the folding mirrors ( @xmath16 in our case ) .",
    "the expression ( [ dtol ] ) , inverted , can be used to convert the measured displacement from @xmath11 to @xmath14 . in this way , from the measurement in fig .",
    "( [ spettro ] ) we can directly deduce the displacement of ideal translation modes , while for other mechanical modes one can only see in the spectrum the corresponding fluctuations of the cavity length . in the approximated scheme with rigid masses ,",
    "the relevant torsion modes correspond to rotations of the mass around an horizontal ( modes a , b in fig .",
    "( [ spettro ] ) ) or a vertical axis ( mode d in the figure ) . in this approximation",
    ", such modes do not change the cavity length at the first order in the angular motion .",
    "therefore , the system should be completely blind to the torsion modes , that are excited and detected only thanks to deformations in the masses and frames .",
    "( left ) or a photo - thermal deformation @xmath17 ( right ) . in the case of the folding mirror ,",
    "the path change is ( considering the right panel ) @xmath18 , while for the end mirror it is simply @xmath17 .",
    "the incidence angle ( @xmath16 in our setup ) is exaggerated for clearness . ]",
    "the mechanical quality factors of the modes , measured from their spectral width , are respectively 1800 ( heavy mass translation mode at 795  hz ) , 850 ( light mass translation mode at 1190  hz ) , and 310 ( heavy mass torsion mode around a vertical axis , at 1166  hz ) .",
    "the ratio between the areas of the two peaks corresponding to the first order translation mode of the two masses is 1.45 , in fair agreement with the value of 1.69 calculated by assuming a white driving force noise .",

    ", we obtain for the two modes effective temperatures of about 3300  k and 3900  k respectively , clearly showing that the effects of external , technical noise is about one order of magnitude larger than thermal noise .",

    "now , in a ffp , @xmath55 where @xmath56 are the losses in a single spot ( in the round - trip , each spot is touched twice ) .",

    "the sensitivity is not enough to see the effects of local thermal noise and radiation pressure effects : the former is overwhelmed by laser frequency noise , the latter by photo - thermal background .",
    "however , for what the wide area readout is concerned , such photo - thermal expansion behaves exactly like a deformation due to radiation pressure : phase and amplitude of the response are different , but the effects on the different spots sum up in the same way .    as a further difference with respect to the described model",

    "a signal proportional to the detuning is frequency filtered and transformed into a force acting on the oscillator .",

    "taking a feedback proportional to the oscillator velocity , e.g. , @xmath85 , the effective eigenfrequency and quality factor do not depend on @xmath86 , and the equation of motion is the same as the one of a free oscillator , with modified damping ( @xmath87 ) and temperature . in particular , for @xmath88 the quality factor is increased and the effective temperature , obtained from the integral of the spectrum as in eq .",

    "the same expressions for negative @xmath90 gives lowering quality factor and temperature ( cold damping ) .",
    "if @xmath91 has a different dependence on @xmath86 , the parallelism between the modified evolution equation and a free oscillator is not straightforward . even in simple realistic schemes the energy equipartition does not hold and a system temperature is not well defined , as discussed , e.g. , in ref .",

    "even a colored external noise can be included in the discussion , provided that it has a smooth spectrum in the region of the peak . in this case",
    "an effective temperature can still be defined according to eq .",

    "the laser is kept at resonance and a signal proportional to the detuning is sent to correct the laser power . neglecting the laser frequency fluctuations and the cavity length noise ( except for the oscillating mirror position @xmath102 ) , the loop gain can be written as @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a ( complex and frequency - dependent ) electronic servo loop gain expressed as the ratio between the detuning fluctuations @xmath105 and the consequent imposed relative power fluctuations .    in the hybrid configuration , the cooling laser is detuned and the feedback is on the detuning .",

    "the cavity and/or the laser frequency fluctuations may contain a term proportional to @xmath105 through electronic servo loop gains that we call respectively @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
