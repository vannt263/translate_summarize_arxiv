    "the observation of the signal of the @xmath0 exotic baryon  @xcite , broadly known as the pentaquark for its minimal five - quark fock space assignment in quantum chromodynamics , was stimulated by the prediction  @xcite of a @xmath5 baryon antidecuplet .",
    "many experimental and theoretical studies have been devoted to this resonance  @xcite .",
    "the original states proposed to form this antidecuplet  @xcite were : @xmath6 where the first and last , explicitly exotic states , had not been observed at that time .",
    "isospin su(2 ) is expected to hold to very good accuracy and we do not list the @xmath7 quantum number .",
    "this assignment is now , however , challenged for several reasons .",
    "first , the na49 collaboration  @xcite reported evidence for an exotic cascade @xmath8 , probably in the same antidecuplet , with a much lighter mass , 1860 mev .",
    "this is somewhat problematic as doubts have arisen  @xcite , and it has not been seen in other experiments  @xcite ( see , however , k. kadija s presentation at the pentaquark04 workshop  @xcite with new reanalyses still supporting the findings of ref .",
    ". however , should the state be reconfirmed at 1860 mev , using the standard gell - mann ",
    "okubo rule ( gmo ) of equal mass splittings for the su(3 ) antidecuplet , the mass of @xmath9 would have to be near 1647 mev , which is about 60 mev below the nominal one @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , the mass of @xmath10 would have to be about @xmath11 mev .",
    "since a @xmath12 resonance is listed at @xmath13 mev with the same spin and parity , we will refer to the @xmath12 member of the antidecuplet as @xmath14 .",
    "the association of this state to the @xmath15 would not fit in that scenario  @xcite .",
    "second , quark model calculations that have appeared after the report of the evidence of @xmath0 tend to predict an @xmath9 at around @xmath16 mev  @xcite .",
    "these predicted the @xmath17 at @xmath18 mev  @xcite , which is more in line with the experimental outcome than the original calculation of the chiral soliton model , although the latter can be readjusted ( then underestimating the @xmath19 ) .",
    "another difficulty arises because of the potential mixing of the nonexotic members of the multiplet , the @xmath9 and @xmath10 with members of pentaquark or ordinary three - quark octets  @xcite .",
    "this would make the mass splitting between the physical states dependent on two mixing angles .",
    "a current conjecture is a mixing with the roper resonance  @xcite that would , by level repulsion , push the @xmath1 further above the @xmath0 than predicted by the gmo rule . also with ideal",
    "mixing , the hidden strangeness @xmath20 wave function dominates the @xmath1 , thus raising its mass .",
    "however , such a strong mixing is not preferred by other authors  @xcite . in summary",
    ", a new @xmath19 state would have to be searched for at a smaller mass if we were to impose perfect gmo rule .",
    "the models we work with in this paper are rather phenomenological .",
    "however , our method , based on symmetry principles , is suited to at least estimating meson cloud effects , which are important for the understanding of pentaquark properties .",
    "the main conclusion of this work is that the virtual `` two - meson cloud '' yields an attractive self - energy that provides about 20% of the pentaquark mass splittings .",
    "we believe that our study here will become useful when more data are available .",
    "the study presented here is complementary and looks for another source of mass splitting not contemplated by the gmo rule .",
    "it would come from the two - meson cloud .",
    "the possibility of constructing the @xmath0 as a @xmath21 bound state  @xcite has been examined in some detail  @xcite employing meson - meson and meson - baryon interactions from chiral lagrangians , where attraction was found but not strong enough to bind the system . yet , this result leaves one wondering as to what role the two - meson cloud could play in the stability of the state . coupling to multi - meson components is also implicit in the chiral soliton picture , which leads to small masses of the @xmath0  @xcite .    in the present paper , we do not face the possible contribution of the one - meson cloud to the antidecuplet binding , which can be easily addressed as a minor correction to our results .",
    "the small width of the @xmath0 to @xmath22 , in spite of the appreciable phase space available , qualitatively demands that this contribution should be reasonably small ; in fact , it has been checked quantitatively in refs .",
    "the self - energy of @xmath0 with a two - meson cloud has been studied in parallel  @xcite in the context of the medium modification of @xmath0 and possible formation of @xmath0 hypernuclei  @xcite .",
    "we here report in full on vacuum results for not only the @xmath0 but also other members of the antidecuplet .",
    "an important experimental input relevant to the present study is the relatively large branching ratio of @xmath1 into @xmath2 , about @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "the branching ratio into @xmath2 with the two pions in an @xmath3 wave is @xmath24 and into @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "this @xmath1 resonance and its baryon - meson - meson decay mode has been used in ref .",
    "@xcite to produce a good shape of the @xmath27 distribution in the @xmath28 reaction leading to the @xmath29  .    in the present work",
    ", we assume that the @xmath1 has a large antidecuplet component  @xcite , and we will perform a study of the @xmath2 @xmath3 wave and @xmath25 decay channels of this resonance and their influence on the masses of various members of the antidecuplet .",
    "certainly one has to accept a mixing with an octet component for realistic resonances in order , for instance , to explain the @xmath1 decay into @xmath30 , which is forbidden for its antidecuplet component  @xcite .",
    "but we do not expect the mixing angle to be close to ideal , as this would imply a stronger @xmath31 branching ratio than @xmath26 , as observed experimentally .",
    "the decay pattern of @xmath1 and @xmath32 also supports the small mixing angle  @xcite .",
    "the present study also provides information on the antidecuplet baryon - baryon - meson - meson @xmath33 contact interaction , which could be applied to the study of @xmath0 production with the @xmath34 and @xmath35 reactions .",
    "these reactions are studied in refs .",
    "@xcite and experimental information is becoming available  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lag ] , we construct various @xmath36 interactions with the two octet mesons and one baryon belonging to octets and with the other baryon to an antidecuplet . in sec .  [",
    "sec : self ] , we compute the contributions of two - meson and one - baryon loops to the mass splittings among the members of antidecuplet baryons . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we present numerical results and discuss the importance of two - meson contributions to the mass splittings and partial decay widths .",
    "as we will see , the contributions from the two - meson loops provide sizable contributions to supplement the mass splittings naively expected from strange quark counting",
    ". we will then discuss the range of interaction strengths of various coupling terms .",
    "section  [ sec : summary ] is devoted to a summary .",
    "we also add appendices , where complete tables for the @xmath36 interactions are presented .",
    "following a common convention  @xcite , we write the physical meson and baryon fields as follows @xmath37 the antidecuplet containing the exotic pentaquark states is a tensor @xmath38 totally symmetric in its three su(3 ) indices .",
    "the components of @xmath38 are related to the physical fields by @xmath39 where we have adopted the normalization in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is different from those used in refs .",
    "@xcite by a sign and/or a factor .",
    "now we consider the possible interaction lagrangians , constrained to be su(3 ) symmetric .",
    "we intend to address the process @xmath40 where an octet baryon @xmath41 and two octet mesons @xmath42 couple to an antidecuplet baryon @xmath43 . to have an su(3 ) invariant lagrangian",
    ", we couple first the two @xmath44 and then combine the resulting irreducible representations with the baryon @xmath45 to produce a @xmath46 representation .",
    "the group theoretical irreducible decomposition gives @xmath47 here @xmath48 and @xmath49 denote symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of the two - meson fields .",
    "hence we obtain four @xmath46 representations after recoupling @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 with @xmath41 .      in constructing effective lagrangians ,",
    "we follow the principle of using the minimum numbers of derivatives in the fields .",
    "this will be released later when we discuss possible structures involving derivatives . to construct @xmath48 from two @xmath44",

    "\\label{eq : mm8s}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we combine this now with an @xmath45 to give an antidecuplet @xmath55      = & 2\\phi_{l}{}^{a}\\phi_{a}{}^{i } b_{m}{}^{j}\\epsilon^{lmk }     \\nonumber \\\\      & + ( i , j , k\\text { symmetrized } )   .",

    "denotes the hermitian conjugate terms , in order to take into account the processes in which the antidecuplet is in the initial state .",
    "note also that two @xmath57 fields have appeared , and we have included a factor @xmath58 in order to make @xmath59 dimensionless ( @xmath60 is the pion decay constant @xmath61 mev ) .      next we take the antisymmetric combination of the @xmath44 and @xmath44 , which for identical meson octets leads to @xmath62      = \\phi_{i}{}^{a } \\phi_{a}{}^{j }      -\\phi_{i}{}^{a } \\phi_{a}{}^{j}=0 .",
    "\\label{eq : mm8a}\\ ] ] so given the identity of the meson octets , this combination is zero .",
    "the simplest way to construct the lagrangian of this structure is to introduce a derivative in one of the fields , which leads automatically to the vector current consisting of two meson fields .",

    "there are two independent terms with no derivatives , namely eqs .   and . with one derivative , there are four more terms available , but we will consider only eq .  , which has the structure for the decay of @xmath73-wave ) as observed experimentally .",
    "in the perturbative chiral lagrangian approach , one would like to implement chiral symmetry as a derivative expansion .",
    "in addition , one of the advantages of chiral lagrangians is that they relate coupling constants of different processes and , in particular , with increasing number of mesons .",
    "however , in the present case we can not take advantage of any of these relations , since the couplings for the present lagrangians are _ a priori _ completely arbitrary , and we are only interested in the two - meson problem . still , in this section we build the lowest - order chiral lagrangian , with two derivatives .",
    "let us remark that the chiral expansion with baryons is known to converge much more slowly than chiral perturbation theory with mesons , and this lowest - order lagrangian can only be expected to give a mere qualitative description of the physics .",
    "for that reason , to build the lagrangians of the previous secs .",
    "[ subsec:8slag ] and [ subsec:27lag ] we just relied on flavor su(3 ) .",
    "still , we will check here that the lack of chiral symmetry in those lagrangians does not have much relevance to the mass splittings and decays we are interested in , since already with the leading - order lagrangian we get qualitatively the same results .",
    "in other words , the relevant symmetry here is su(3 ) , not chiral symmetry .    to show this",
    ", we write a chiral invariant lagrangian by making the substitution @xmath74 in eq .",

    "to the leading order in meson field , @xmath80 , we find the interaction lagrangian induced from eq .   by making the replacement @xmath81",
    "obviously , the su(3 ) structure is not affected by this procedure , although the use of lagrangians involving derivatives will introduce some degree of su(3 ) breaking due to the momenta of mesons .",
    "hence , it is useful to verify that this chiral invariant lagrangian will lead eventually to the same results as those obtained from the lagrangians without derivatives in the fields .",

    "( [ eq : chirallag ] ) .      in this section ,",
    "we consider the su(3 ) breaking interaction term within the context of chiral lagrangians . without using derivatives in the fields , the only possible term is a mass term that violates both su(3 ) and chiral symmetry , but in the way demanded by the underlying qcd lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "the mass term appears through the combination @xmath82 with the mass matrix , written in terms of the meson masses , @xmath83 then it leads to the lagrangian @xmath84 in the expansion of @xmath85 , we have two meson fields with the structure @xmath86 substituting @xmath87 for @xmath85 in eq .  , we obtain the desired mass lagrangian .",

    "<S> we study the two - meson virtual cloud contribution to the self - energy of the su(3 ) antidecuplet , to which the @xmath0 pentaquark is assumed to belong . </S>",
    "<S> this is motivated by the large branching ratio of the @xmath1 decay into two pions and one nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> we derive effective lagrangians that describe the @xmath1 decay into @xmath2 with two pions in @xmath3 or @xmath4 wave . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain increased binding for all members of the antidecuplet and a contribution to the mass splitting between states with different strangeness which is at least 20% of the empirical one . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide predictions for three - body decays of the pentaquark antidecuplet . </S>"
