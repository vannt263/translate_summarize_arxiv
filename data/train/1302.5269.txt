    "study of quantum systems the configuration space of which is geometrically and topologically nontrivial proved to be a fruitful subject both theoretically and practically .",
    "a lot of attention has been paid to quantum graphs  a survey and a guide to further reading can be found in @xcite . together with that other systems have been studied which one can regard as generalization of quantum graphs where the ` edges ' may have different dimensions ; using the theory of self - adjoint extensions one can construct operator classes which serve as hamiltonians of such models @xcite .",
    "one sometimes uses a pictorial term ` hedgehog manifold ' for a geometrical construct consisting of riemannian manifolds of dimension two or three together with line segments attached to them . in this paper",
    "we consider the simplest situation when we have a single connected manifold to which a finite number of semiinfinite leads are attached  one is especially interested in transport in such a system .",
    "particular models of this type have been studied , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "again for the sake of simplicity we limit ourselves mostly to the situation when there are no external fields ; the hamiltonian will act as the negative second derivative on the halflines representing the leads and as laplace - beltrami operator on the manifold .",
    "we have said that quantum motion on hedgehog manifolds can be regarded as a generalization of quantum graphs .",
    "it is therefore useful to compare similarities and differences of the two cases , and we will recall at appropriate places of the text how the claims look like when the riemannian manifold is replaced by a compact metric graph .    the first question one has to pose when resonances are discussed is what is meant by this term .",
    "the two prominent instances are _ resolvent resonances _ identified with poles of the analytically continued resolvent of the hamiltonian and _ scattering resonances _ where we look instead into the analytical structure of the on - shell scattering operator . while the two often coincide , in general in may not be so ; recall that the former are the property of a single operator while the latter refer to the pair of the full and unperturbed hamiltonians , and often also a third one , an identification operator , which one uses if the two hamiltonians act on different hilbert spaces @xcite .    the first question we will thus address deals with the two resonance definitions for quantum motion on hedgehog manifolds . using an exterior complex scaling",
    "we will show that in this case both notions coincide and one is thus allowed to speak about resonances without a further specification .",
    "the result is the same as for quantum graphs @xcite and , needles to say , in many other situations .",
    "the next question to be addressed in this paper concerns the high energy behaviour of the resonances which is , for this purpose , useful to count together with the eigenvalues .",
    "note that if a hedgehog manifold with a finite number of junctions is compact having finite line segments , its spectrum is purely discrete and an easy estimate yields the spectral behaviour at high energies .",
    "it follows the usual weyl s law @xcite , and moreover , it is determined by the manifold component with the highest dimension , that is , in our case the riemannian manifold @xcite .",
    "if , on the other hand , the leads are semiinfinite , the essential spectrum covers the positive real axis .",
    "in contrast to the usual schrdinger operator theory it often contains embedded eigenvalues ; it happens typically when the laplace - beltrami operator which is the manifold part of the hamiltonian has an eigenfunction with zeros at the hedgehog junctions .",
    "since such eigenvalues are unstable  a geometrical perturbation turns them generically into resonances  it is natural to count them together with the ` true ' resonances ; one then asks about the asymptotics of the number of such singularities enclosed in the circle of radius @xmath0 in the momentum plane .",
    "this question is made intriguing by the recent observation @xcite that in some quantum graphs the asymptotics may not be of weyl type .",
    "the reason behind this effect is that symmetries , maybe not apparent ones , may effectively diminish the graph size making a part of it effectively belonging to a lead instead .",
    "the mechanism uses the fact that all the edges of a quantum graph are one - dimensional , and one may expect that such a thing would not happen on hedgehog manifolds where the particles is forced to ` change dimension ' at the junctions .",
    "we are going to give a partial confirmation of this conjecture by showing that , in contrast to the quantum - graph case , the resonances can not be found at arbitrary distance from real axis in the momentum plane as long as the leads are attached at a single point of the manifold .",
    "the third and the last question addressed here is again inspired by an observation about quantum graphs .",
    "it has been noted that a magnetic field can change the effective size of some quantum graphs with a non - weyl asymptotics @xcite : if we follow the resonance poles as functions of the field we observe that at some field values they move to ( imaginary ) infinity and the resonances disappear . on hedgehog manifolds",
    "the situation is different , nevertheless a similar effect may again occur ; we will present a simple example of such a system in which a suitable aharonov - bohm field removes all the ` true ' resonances , i.e. those with pole position having nonzero imaginary part .",
    "let us first give a proper meaning to what we described above as quantum motion on a hedgehog manifold ; doing so we generalize previously used definitions  see , e.g. @xcite  by allowing more than a single semiinfinite lead be attached at a point of the manifold .",
    "consider a compact and connected riemannian manifold @xmath1 , endowed with metric @xmath2 .",
    "the manifold may or may not have a boundary , in the latter case we suppose that @xmath3 is smooth .",
    "we denote by @xmath4 the geometric object consisting of @xmath5 and a finite number @xmath6 of halflines attached at points @xmath7 belonging to a finite subset @xmath8 of the interior of @xmath5  see figure [ fig1 ]  we will employ the term _ hedgehog manifold _ , or simply manifold if there is no danger of misunderstanding . by @xmath9",
    "we denote the total number of the halflines .",
    "the hilbert space we are going to consider consists of direct sum of the ` component ' hilbert spaces , in other words , its elements are square integrable functions on every component of @xmath4 , @xmath10 where @xmath11 stands for @xmath12 and @xmath13 for lebesque measure on @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath15 be the closure of the laplace - beltrami operator @xmath16 with the domain consisting of functions in @xmath17 ; if the boundary of @xmath5 is nonempty we require that they satisfy at it appropriate boundary conditions , either neumann / robin , @xmath18 , or dirichlet , @xmath19 .",
    "( as mentioned above , we make this assumption for the sake of simplicity and most considerations below extend easily to schrdinger type operators @xmath20 provided the potential @xmath21 is sufficiently regular . )",
    "the domain of @xmath15 coincides with @xmath22 which , in particular , means that @xmath23 makes sense for @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the restriction @xmath26 of @xmath15 to the domain @xmath27 is a symmetric operator with deficiency indices @xmath28 , cf .",
    "furthermore , we denote by @xmath29 the negative laplacian on @xmath30 referring to the @xmath31-th halfline and by @xmath32 its restriction to functions which vanish together with their first derivative at the halfline endpoint .",
    "since each @xmath32 has deficiency indices @xmath33 , the direct sum @xmath34 is a symmetric operator with deficiency indices @xmath35 .",
    "the family of admissible hamiltonians for quantum motion on the hedgehog manifold @xmath4 can be identified with the self - adjoint extensions of the operator @xmath36 .",
    "the procedure how to construct them using the boundary - value theory was described in detail in @xcite .",
    "it is a modification of the analogous result from the quantum graph theory @xcite , and in a broader context of a known general result @xcite .",
    "all the extensions are described by the coupling conditions @xmath37 where @xmath38 is an @xmath39 unitary matrix , @xmath40 the corresponding unit matrix and @xmath41 , @xmath42 are the columns of ( generalized ) boundary values .",
    "the first @xmath43 entries correspond to the manifold part being equal to the leading and next - to - leading terms of the asymptotics of @xmath23 on @xmath5 in the vicinity of @xmath44 , while @xmath45 describe the limits of the wave function and its first derivative on @xmath31-th halfline , respectively .",
    "more precisely , according to lemma  4 in @xcite , for @xmath46 the asymptotic expansion near @xmath44 has the form @xmath47 , where @xmath48 \\frac{q_3(x , x_j)}{4 \\pi}\\ , ( r(x , x_j))^{-1 } & \\quad \\dots \\quad & n = 3\\\\ \\end{array}\\right.\\label{eq - asym}\\ ] ] here @xmath49 are continuous functions of @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 denotes the geodetic distance between @xmath50 and @xmath44 .",
    "function @xmath53 is the leading term , independent of energy , of the green s function asymptotics near @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath54 with the remainder term @xmath55 .",
    "the self - adjoint extension of @xmath36 determined by the condition ( [ eq - coupling ] ) will be denoted as @xmath56 ; we will drop the subscript if the choice of @xmath38 is either clear from the context or not important .",
    "not all self - adjoint extensions , however , make in general sense from the physics point of view .",
    "the reason is that for @xmath57 one finds among them such extensions which would allow the particle living on @xmath4 to hop from a junction to another one .",
    "we restrict our attention in what follows to _ local _ couplings for which such a situation can not occur .",
    "they are described by matrices which are block diagonal , so that such a @xmath38 does not connect disjoint junction points @xmath44 .",
    "the coupling condition ( [ eq - coupling ] ) is then a family of @xmath43 conditions , each referring to a particular @xmath44 and coupling the corresponding ( sub)columns @xmath58 and @xmath59 by means of the respective block @xmath60 of @xmath38 .    before proceeding further",
    "we will mention a useful trick , known from quantum - graph theory @xcite , which allows to study a compact scatterer with leads looking at its ` core ' alone replacing the leads by effective coupling at the points @xmath44 which is a non - selfadjoint , energy - dependent point interaction , namely @xmath61 @xmath62^{-1 } u_{3j}\\ , ,   \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 denotes the top - left entry of @xmath60 , @xmath64 the rest of the first row , @xmath65 the rest of the first column and @xmath66 is @xmath67 part corresponding to the coupling between the halflines attached to the manifold .",
    "this can be easily checked using the standard argument ascribed , in different fields , to different people such as schur , feshbach , grushin , etc .",
    "the model described in the previous section provides a natural framework to study scattering on the hedgehog manifold .",
    "the existence of scattering is easy to establish because any hamiltonian of the considered class differs from one with decoupled leads by a finite - rank perturbation in the resolvent @xcite .",
    "finding the on - shell scattering matrix is computationally slightly more complicated but simple in principle .",
    "the solution of schrdinger equation on the @xmath68-th external lead with energy @xmath69 can be expressed as a linear combination of the incoming and outgoing waves , @xmath70 .",
    "the scattering matrix then maps the vector of incoming wave amplitudes @xmath71 into the vector of outgoing wave amplitudes @xmath72 .",
    "we emphasize that our convention , which is natural in this context and analogous to the one used in quantum - graph theory @xcite differs from the one employed when scattering on the real line is treated @xcite , in that each lead is identified with the positive real halfline . for the case of two leads , in particular , it means that columns of the @xmath73 scattering matrix are interchanged and we have    [ l1 ] the on - shell scattering matrix satisfies @xmath74 where star and bar denote the hermitian and complex conjugation , respectively .",
    "the claim follows directly from the definition of scattering matrix and from properties of schrdinger equation and its external solutions .",
    "since the potential is absent we infer that if @xmath75 is a solution of the schrdinger equation for a given @xmath76 , so is @xmath77 .",
    "this means that @xmath78 can be regarded both as an operator mapping @xmath79 to @xmath80 or as a map from @xmath81 to @xmath82 , i.e. as the inverse of @xmath83 . in an similar way one can establish the second identity .",
    "[ rem1 ] if @xmath5 is replaced by a compact metric graph and the potential is again absent , the s - matrix can be written as @xmath84 where the @xmath85 matrix @xmath86 is an analogue of jost function .",
    "in particular , @xmath78 is unitary for @xmath87 , however , we will need it also for complex values of @xmath76 . by a _ scattering resonance _",
    "we conventionally understand a pole of the on - shell scattering matrix in the complex plane , more precisely , the point at which some of its entries have a pole singularity .    a _ resolvent resonance _ , on the other hand ,",
    "is identified with a pole of the resolvent analytically continued from the upper complex halfplane to a region of the lower one . a convenient and efficient way of treating resolvent resonances is the method of exterior complex scaling based on the ideas of aguilar , baslev , combes , and simon  cf .",

    "we identify , in analogy with the quantum - graph situation mentioned above , the exterior part of @xmath4 with the leads , and scale the wave function at each them using the transformation @xmath91 which is , of course , unitary for real @xmath92 , while for a complex @xmath92 it leads to the desired rotation of the essential spectrum . to use it",

    "algebraic multiplicities of the resonances defined in both ways coincide .",
    "consider first the scattering resonances .",
    "the starting point is the generalized eigenfunction describing the scattering at the energy @xmath69 and its analytical continuation to the lower complex halfplane . from the previous lemma",
    "we know that for @xmath96 the restriction of the appropriate schrdinger equation solution to the manifold is a linear combination of at most @xmath43 green s functions ; we denote the corresponding vector of coefficients by @xmath107 .",
    "the relation between these coefficients and amplitudes of the outgoing and incoming wave is given by ( [ eq - coupling ] ) .",
    "using @xmath108 as a shortcut for the vector of the amplitudes of the incoming waves , @xmath109 , and similarly @xmath110 for the vector of the amplitudes of the outgoing waves one obtains in general system of equations @xmath111 in which @xmath112 and @xmath113 are @xmath114 matrices and @xmath115 is @xmath116 matrix the elements of which are exponentials and green s functions , regularized if needed  recall that @xmath43 is the number of internal parameters associated with the junctions and @xmath117 is the number of the leads .",
    "what is important that all the entries of the mentioned matrices allow for an analytical continuation which makes it possible to ask for solution of equations ( [ scattres ] ) for @xmath118 from the open lower complex halfplane .",
    "it is obvious that for @xmath106 the columns of @xmath119 have to be linearly independent ; otherwise @xmath120 would be an eigenvalue of @xmath121 with an eigenfunction supported on the manifold @xmath5 only .",
