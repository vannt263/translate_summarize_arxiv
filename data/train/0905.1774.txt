    "the presence of sic absorption was further confirmed by @xcite based on the _ infrared space observatory ( iso _ ) observations .",

    "the molecular lines detected in the high frequency window are a factor of about two more than those detected in the low frequency window .",
    "this is partially due to the fact that the aro 12 m telescope has a larger beam size than the smt and thus the 12 m data are more likely to be affected by the beam dilution .",

    "the shapes of these curves in figure  [ cum ] are similar with each other although that of seems to be slightly steeper than the other two .",
    "this suggests that the differences between the three objects can be mostly a distance effect , and the detection of a large number of lines in irc+10216 does not imply that irc+10216 is unique or richer in molecular content than the other two .",
