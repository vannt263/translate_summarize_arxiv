    "the existence of space - time singularities is a common property of most solutions of the general theory of relativity , including various black - hole or cosmological ones .",
    "the well - known raychaudhuri equation @xcite has played a key role in describing such singularities @xcite .",
    "this equation has also been used in different other contexts @xcite .",
    "it has also attracted some attention beyond the classical descriptions , for example , a bohmian quantum version of the equation was recently introduced in ref.@xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we aim to investigate this equation in the framework of the weyl conformal theory of gravity by considering time - like world - lines .",
    "this theory emerged from attempts to unify gravity with electromagnetism and since its advent in about a century ago , it continued to attract the attention of researchers in the field .",
    "sharing several important solutions with the einstein theory of gravity , it also possesses the interesting property of being invariant under conformal transformations , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "the relationships between this theory and the general theory of relativity have been discussed in several places , namely , in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which maldacena has shown that it is possible to single out the einstein solution from the numerous solution to weyl theory by deploying a simple neumann boundary condition , and in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it has been shown that varying the full connection of the weyl gravity results in the vacuum einstein equations .",
    "null trajectories in weyl gravity have been studied in @xcite .",
    "the connections between weyl gravity and extensions of the critical gravity was considered in @xcite . some difficulties with weyl gravity",
    "have been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    here",
    ", we consider the vacuum solution of the weyl gravity which is a three - parameter schwarzschild - like solution supplemented by linear and quadratic terms .",
    "this solution has been used in different proposals , say , in @xcite to explain the galactic rotation curves , in @xcite to study the sagnac effect , in @xcite to investigate strong lensing , and in @xcite to study gravito - magnetic effects .",
    "the classical issues of bending of light and perihelion precession have been re - examined with this theory in refs . @xcite and @xcite , respectively .    our motivations for the present study originates from both the interest in raychaudhuri equation and its applications in different contexts , and the weyl conformal gravity as a theory of gravity with conformal invariance .",
    "the conformal invariance in gravity theories is regarded as an essential symmetry , see e.g. the discussion in @xcite .",
    "also , modified gravities with quadratic curvature have attracted a lot of attention in recent decade and weyl gravity as a particular model in this class , deserves further study in this regard .",
    "in what follows , we start with the action and field equations of the weyl conformal gravity .",
    "we then proceed by a brief review of the vacuum static solution of the theory and relevant equations for time - like geodesics . using these equations ,",
    "we apply the raychaudhuri equation to a congruence of radial flow and a flow with both radial and rotational velocities to investigate the focusing of geodesics . after comparing the results with those of the standard schwarzschild space - time , we investigate the effect of conformal transformations .",
    "a summary of the results will conclude the work .",
    "the weyl theory of gravity is a theory of fourth order with respect to the metric .",
    "it is characterized by the action @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the weyl invariant , and @xmath2 is a coupling constant . using the properties of the gauss - bonnet invariant ,",
    "the above action can be rewritten as @xmath3 varying the action given in eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) , supplemented by a matter action , with respect to @xmath4 one gets the following field equation @xmath5 in which @xmath6 is the bach tensor @xcite , and @xmath7 is the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the vacuum field equation @xmath8 admits a static spherically symmetric solution defined by the line element @xmath9 in which @xmath10 this solution was first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . by choosing appropriate values for the parameters @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , the schwarzschild - de sitter metric could be regenerated .",
    "the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath12 can be related to the mass of the source and the cosmological constant , respectively .",
    "in fact , @xmath14 gives the source mass .",
    "the third parameter , @xmath15 is thus the crucial one here , carrying additional physical content , which might be related to dark matter @xcite .",
    "for the the space - time described by the metric ( [ 14 ] ) and ( [ 15 ] ) , if we take @xmath16 , then depending on the sign of @xmath15 , there are one or two horizons corresponding to the roots of @xmath17 .",
    "these are given by @xmath18 by assuming @xmath19 , we obtain @xmath20 which are consistent if @xmath21 .",
    "if , in addition , @xmath22 , then @xmath23 . for @xmath24 , the second root is ruled out , and one is left with the horizon corresponding to @xmath25 . the function @xmath17 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] for both typical positive and negative values of @xmath15 .",
    "as this figure shows , in the case where @xmath21 , there is a maximum whose location is given by @xmath26 , and the maximum value is given by @xmath27 taking @xmath28 , these have the numerical values @xmath29 ; and @xmath30 for @xmath31 , respectively .     in terms of @xmath32 for @xmath28 ; @xmath33 ( lower ) , @xmath34 ( middle ) , and @xmath35 ( upper ) . ]",
    "now , we study the evolution of time - like geodesics in the space - time defined by eq .",
    "( [ 14 ] ) .",
    "we start with the 4-velocity vector field @xmath36 with @xmath37 , which defines a time - like congruence in the space - time under consideration . here , @xmath38 stands for @xmath39 , @xmath40 being an affine parameter along the relevant integral curves . due to the symmetries of the space - time described by eq .",
    "( [ 15 ] ) , we can set @xmath41 .",
    "then , the time - like killing vectors @xmath42 and @xmath43 together with the fact that @xmath44 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , result in @xmath45 where @xmath46 are constants .",
    "thus , from the geodesic equation @xmath47 or , from the normalization of the four - velocity , one obtains @xmath48 for a radial flow , @xmath49 , we have @xmath50 in schwarzschild space - time , for @xmath51 , we obtain @xmath52 .",
    "thus , by setting @xmath53 , one can choose @xmath54 , as viewed by an observer at infinity .",
    "in fact , it is well - known that @xmath55 is equal to the particle energy in units of @xmath56 .    in the space - time under consideration here , which is not asymptotically flat , we can not simply start by choosing @xmath53 . to fix the constant @xmath55 , one needs to use some initial conditions , say , the initial value of @xmath57 , or the maximum distance the particles can reach .",
    "the choice of the value of @xmath55 affects the motion of particles .",
    "this can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ 24 ] ) .",
    "for , @xmath49 and @xmath21 , if we choose @xmath58 , there will be turning points whose locations , @xmath59 , are given by the solutions of the equation @xmath60 , or equivalently , @xmath61 , and the particles motion are confined to @xmath62 , or @xmath63 , depending on the initial positions .",
    "if we choose @xmath64 , there will be no turning points and particles can pass through @xmath65",
    ". it would be useful to note that @xmath66 is equal to , for example , about @xmath67 for @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "we now use the well - known raychaudhuri equation @xmath68 to study the behavior of the above congruence . here , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71}$ ] are the scalar expansion , the symmetric traceless shear tensor , the antisymmetric rotation tensor , respectively , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .    for the radial congruence described by eq .",
    "( [ 24 ] ) , it can be shown that the rotation tensor vanishes and therefore , @xmath75 the right hand side of this equation is negative for @xmath76 , which means focusing of the congruence . however , for @xmath21 , the right hand side is not necessarily negative and the equation does not guarantee convergence . to analyze the latter case",
    ", we use a direct calculation of the expansion . by neglecting the cosmological constant",
    ", we obtain @xmath77 in which the negative sign corresponds to outgoing world - lines @xmath78 , and the positive sign is associated with incoming ones with @xmath79 .",
    "now , the rate of change of this expression can be obtained either by direct differentiation , or by using the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 27 ] ) .",
    "the resulting expression have a rather algebraically complicated numerator quartic in @xmath32 , and factors of @xmath80 in the denominator .",
    "thus , for an arbitrary value of @xmath55 , there are up to four sign changes ( corresponding to the roots of the numerator ) , and a divergency ( in either side of @xmath65 , corresponding to the roots of the expression in the denominator ) . for clarity , we consider the case where there are no turning points , which is the case for @xmath64 . for convenience , we take @xmath81 which means @xmath82 . the function @xmath83 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] in terms of @xmath32 and @xmath84 for an incoming congruence with a typical value @xmath85 .",
    "this shows that the world - line are convergent .     in terms of @xmath32 and @xmath84 for @xmath86 .",
    "]    to have a better understanding of the physical content of eq .",
    "( [ 26 ] ) , we consider the galaxy cluster abell 370 which is known particularly in relation with strong lensing phenomenon @xcite .",
    "it has a mass of @xmath87 . using this",
    ", we may set @xmath88 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath89 , @xmath90 , i.e. , the linear term and @xmath91 term in @xmath17 are of the same order . also , @xmath92 , while other terms ( except @xmath13 ) in the numerator of @xmath93 in eq .",
    "( [ 26 ] ) are some orders of magnitude smaller , that is , the main contribution to @xmath93 comes from the first two terms in the numerator .",
    "pure rotational flow is also possible with zero expansion as for schwarzschild space - time . for combined radial - rotational flow ( in the equatorial plane )",
    ", we have from eq .",
    "( [ 23 ] ) @xmath94 in which @xmath95 one can show that the relevant rotation tensor vanishes for this flow , and the raychaudhuri equation reduces to @xmath96 again , leading to convergent congruence for non - negative @xmath15 . for negative @xmath15 , the above equation does not result in convergence necessarily .",
    "in fact , in this case we have @xmath97 where @xmath98",
    "this results in a rather complicated expression for @xmath83 , and general behavior of the congruence depends on both @xmath46 .    for radial null geodesics , the geodesic equation results in @xmath99 by choosing @xmath53 , the raychaudhuri equation reads @xmath100 that is , focusing with no signature of @xmath15 .",
    "this has the solution @xmath101 .",
    "the action for weyl gravity and the associated vacuum field equation are invariant under the conformal transformation @xmath102 where @xmath103 is a scalar field .",
    "thus , any metric related to the vacuum solution of the field equations via conformal transformations is also a solution .",
    "however , time - like geodesics are not necessarily mapped to geodesics .",
    "thus , one can ask to what extent results obtained from equations like raychaudhuri equation in a given space - time are valid in the transformed space - time . in this section",
    ", we aim to investigate the behavior of time - like congruences and the raychaudhuri equation under such transformation .",
    "we start with @xmath104 and @xmath105 from which it can be shown that @xmath106 for null geodesics , the last term in the right - hand side of the above equation disappears and one is left with the geodesic equation written in non - affine form .",
    "this is a re - statement of the well - known fact that null geodesics remain geodesics under a conformal transformation . for time - like geodesics ,",
    "this is not the case .",
    "regarding the raychaudhuri equation for time - like congruences , we have @xmath107 or @xmath108 this means that , in general , there is no guarantee that a convergent congruence remains convergent in the transformed space - time .    for a scalar field",
    "@xmath109 which depends only on the radial coordinate , eq .",
    "( [ 13f ] ) reduces to @xmath110 where a prime stands for differentiation with respect to the radial coordinate . as an example , if we choose @xmath111 , we obtain and @xmath112 , which leads to function @xmath113 plotted in fig .",
    "it shows that the congruence is convergent in this particular transformed space .     in terms of @xmath32 for , @xmath111 , @xmath28 , @xmath114",
    "the above results show how the trajectories behave in the transformed space .",
    "it is also possible to have a form of raychaudhuri equation unchanged when transforming to a conformally related space .",
    "this can be reached by considering a dynamical particle mass @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we studied the focusing of time - like congruence within the space - time described by the static vacuum solution to the weyl conformal gravity model . for galactic scales , in which we ignored the cosmological constant ,",
    "a term proportional to @xmath115 is added to the right - hand side of the raychaudhuri equation , where the rotation term is already absent . for positive @xmath15",
    "this ensures the convergence of incoming geodesics with a rate greater than the case of the schwarzschild space - time .",
    "we also obtained a relation between the rate of convergence of a congruence for a given solution and in its conformally transformed space - time .",
    "the resultant equations do not guarantee that a convergent congruence remains so in the transformed space . in the context of cosmology",
    ", these results might help to study how cosmic flows will behave in weyl conformal gravity .",
