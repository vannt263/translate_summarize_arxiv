    "in this work we will continue our study of the casimir friction force between two dielectric plates ( half - spaces ) that move longitudinally with respect to each other with a small separation @xmath0 .",
    "see fig .  1 .    ; lower plate at rest .",
    "gap width is @xmath0.,width=240 ]    this is a topic that has attracted considerable interest in the recent past . in a recent paper of ours",
    "@xcite a problem of this sort was analyzed : we calculated the casimir friction for constant velocity , at zero temperature as well as at finite temperature , requiring vanishing initial and final velocities in order to obtain a closed loop motion meaning a return to the starting position .",
    "the friction force was found via the dissipated energy by which the net contribution from the slow velocity part could be neglected and thus did not require further specification .",
    "moreover , we assumed the simple situation with a constant velocity @xmath1 between the times @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "in addition we assumed very low initial and final velocities in the opposite directions in order to be able to return to the starting position .    in the present work we want to extent our results to the situation where the finite velocity contributing to dissipation",
    "is not restricted to be constant , but may be slowly varying , and not necessarily restricted to rectilinear motion . by that",
    ", circular motion with constant speed can be considered too . a nice feature of the latter kind of motion , besides constant speed",
    ", is its return to the initial position as required by the energy dissipation method .    on physical grounds",
    "it is reason to expect that with slowly varying velocity the total dissipated energy will be the sum of contributions from the various velocities .",
    "this is provided the constant velocity case considered in ref .",
    "@xcite lead to a correct result .",
    "however , this extension of the problem is non - trivial .",
    "the reason is that somehow contributions from different velocities have to be separated from each other while in the reference the contributions from the very slow initial and final velocities could be neglected anyway . as will be seen in sec .  [ sec2 ] to facilitate this separation of contributions ,",
    "we find it necessary to split the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) below in two terms .",
    "these terms are subdivided in different time intervals as given by eq .",
    "( [ 4a ] ) .    for the more general motion considered here , it actually turns out that essentially all the derivations and results of ref .",
    "@xcite remain unchanged .",
    "the exception is the integral containing the specified motion , which becomes more cumbersome and requires a detailed and more accurate treatment to handle nonzero contributions for different velocities .    some papers dealing with casimir friction - most of them quite new - are listed in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "one will find studies also for the case where one single particle is traveling close to a dielectric surface . in principle",
    ", the theory of systems of this kind can be obtained from the full theory of interacting dielectric planes , in the limit of large dilution for one of the planes .",
    "it should be noted that the formalism we use to obtain the friction force has been developed by us in previous works starting with a pair of polarizable particles as a basis and computing the response via the kubo formalism @xcite .",
    "the methods used by us are quite different from the approaches used by others referred to above .",
    "the bases for the use of the kubo formula are developments and results obtained in the statistical mechanics of polar and polarizable fluids . via the feynman path integral this formalism",
    "was extended to polarizable particles whose oscillations were quantized @xcite .",
    "this formalism was further extended by the authors to evaluate casimir forces @xcite and to evaluate casimir friction @xcite .",
    "then it turned out that time dependent interactions like the radiating dipole interaction could be included too in the statistical mechanical treatment where imaginary time is the forth dimension .",
    "an advantage of this formalism is that the electromagnetic field can be disregarded ( or eliminated ) .",
    "instead it is replaced by dipolar interactions between pairs of polarizable particles .",
    "another advantage is thus the possibility to consider media on microscopic level where particles are separated by a minimum distance due to molecular hard cores . in this way it is possible to evaluate ( approximately ) the finite casimir energy in bulk of a simple fluid model @xcite . with the statistical mechanical approach the casimir forces",
    "may be given an alternative physical interpretation ; they are induced molecular attractions due to fluctuating dipole moments .    in the next section dealing with rectilinear motion where the velocity may vary , the key point will be how to handle properly the @xmath4 integral ( eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) below ) and the product with its complex conjugate .",
    "this is needed in order to obtain the total dissipated energy . under the present general circumstances there will be contributions to the dissipation from various velocities that can not be neglected . in ref .",
    "@xcite the simplifying situation with only one velocity was regarded as the contribution from the slow initial and return motions can be neglected anyway . after carrying out this more careful analysis , we consider two - dimensional motion in the horizontal plane in section iii .",
    "finally , we consider in section iv as an example , a rotating planar disc above a resting plate and evaluate the casimir torque .    as before",
    ", we find the friction force to be proportional to @xmath5 at @xmath6 , assuming @xmath1 small , while it is proportional to @xmath1 at finite @xmath7 , assuming @xmath1 small .",
    "as in ref .  @xcite we consider a two - plate setup in which the lower plate ( 2 ) is at rest , while the upper plate ( 1 ) executes motion in a closed loop meaning that it finally slides back to its initial position . the friction force is evaluated via the dissipation of energy , the latter point being advantageous since one avoids the problem of separating a reversible part of the inter - particle force from the total force .",

    "straightforward summation ( or integration ) of particle pairs is no longer valid due to dipolar interactions within each half - plane .",
    "this , however , is taken into account by replacing the polarizability @xmath58 by the corresponding dielectric constant @xmath59 .",
    "the replacement is @xmath60 as given by eq .",
    "this extension to arbitrary densities we showed in sec .  4 of ref .",
    "@xcite .    by some calculation one finds eq .",
    "( i26 ) @xmath61    so far , the formalism works out similarly as in the previous case of ref .",
    "the new element in our analysis is to calculate the integral ( i28 ) of ref .",
    "this integral is @xmath62 with @xmath63 consisting only of a few linear parts in @xmath64 , the integral ( [ 2 ] ) is easily evaluated . but to obtain the appropriate form of the result was less trivial as the product of @xmath4 and its complex conjugate in eq .",
    "( i26 ) or eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) should produce the @xmath65-functions of eq .",
    "but the corresponding @xmath65-functions for the slow initial and return motions were not considered as the dissipation should vanish anyway for these parts . for the present situation with varying velocity all finite velocities will contribute and thus can not be neglected .",
    "so to obtain the desired result in this more general situation the difference between the two terms of the integral have to be taken in a proper way .",
    "if the velocity @xmath66 varies slowly the @xmath63 can be considered piecewise linear in @xmath64 such that explicit integrations can be performed .",
    "however , the additional problem is that expression ( [ 2 ] ) should be multiplied with its complex conjugate as mentioned above by which cross - terms will appear .",
    "the problem is to get rid of these cross - terms . as will be seen below this",
    "is possible by separating the integrand in two parts that are subdivided differently in intervals .    then consider a time interval from @xmath67 to @xmath68 of length @xmath69 .",
    "these times are chosen as limits for part of the first term of the integral of eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding interval for the second term of the integral is chosen from @xmath70 to @xmath71 such that @xmath72 with this subdivision of the two terms of the integrand the full integral will be covered properly by such intervals when the motion that starts at time @xmath73 ends at the same position at time @xmath74 , i.e.  the condition @xmath75 is fulfilled .",

    "this phase factor will vary rapidly as function of @xmath96 since @xmath97 can be chosen large when @xmath63 is slowly varying .",
    "so from this argument we find that cross - terms with such phase factors should vanish by the further integrations of @xmath96 and @xmath98 . with the lack of cross - terms contributions like the ones of eq .",

    "the lower plate is at rest , and is of infinite extent , as before .",
    "the argument is that a rotating plate can be subdivided in small areas whose linear dimension is large compared to the separation from the plate at rest .",
    "each area can thus be regarded as a macroscopic plate that moves around .",
    "this latter small area will also perform a rotation .",

    "there , for instance , the quantum friction force is expected to have exponential growth , but is mentioned to be consistent with the semi - classical result of pendry @xcite in the weak interaction limit .",
    "also a velocity threshold above which quantum friction can take place was found in ref .",
