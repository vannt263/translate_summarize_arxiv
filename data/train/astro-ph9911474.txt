    "radio - loud active galactic nuclei can to first order be classified as having either extended ( 15  kpc ) or compact ( 15  kpc ) radio morphologies .",
    "the former class is characterized by steep , @xmath2 radio spectra , signposting extended regions of optically thin synchrotron emission .",
    "quasars or radio galaxies displaying prominent radio lobes  on size scales of tens to hundreds of kiloparsecs  invariably are characterized by steep radio spectra .",
    "the converse , however , is not true : compact morphologies are found in radio sources having flat as well as steep radio spectra .",
    "compact steep - spectrum ( css ) radio sources are thought to be intrinsically small objects ( e.g. , fanti et al .",
    "@xcite ) , although some css objects may be small due to projection .",
    "ultra - compact gps ( gigahertz peaked spectrum ) radio sources display inverted spectra longward and steep spectra shortward of the peak frequency ( which usually occurs around 1  ghz ) ",
    "see e.g. , odea ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is likely that the classes of gps , css , and extended steep - spectrum sources are connected through temporal evolution ( e.g. , readhead et al",

    "flat - spectrum radio sources invariably display a dominant compact flat - spectrum core component , but additional weak extended emission is usually present .",
    "in addition , vlbi imaging usually resolves the dominant core components into compact core - jet features , often displaying superluminal motion .",
    "orr & browne ( @xcite ) originally proposed that these core - dominated sources are simply extended , steep - spectrum objects viewed at small inclinations , relativistic flux boosting effects being responsible for the bright radio cores . imaging observations of core - dominated quasars have yielded broad consistency with this model , as these objects usually display weak halo and/or ( curved ) jet emission of small angular extent ( e.g. , kollgaard et al .",
    "@xcite ) . within unified models however , the parent population of the core - dominated quasars is not made up of lobe - dominated quasars , but of extended lobe - dominated radio galaxies ( e.g. , urry & padovani @xcite ) . in these models ,",
    "lobe - dominated quasars are thought to have jet inclination angles intermediate between the radio galaxies and the core - dominated quasars .",
    "having data of a large , homogeneous sample of lobe - dominated steep - spectrum quasars at high redshift in hand ( lonsdale et al .",
    "@xcite , lbm93 hereafter ) , we here present an investigation of this unification issue for high redshift quasars .",
    "the uniformity of the lbm93 data base coupled to new sensitive high resolution observations of core - dominated objects is expected to yield useful constraints on the relevant unification models .",
    "in order to complement our lbm93 data base of steep - spectrum quasars , we selected a new sample of 16 powerful radio - loud quasars with spectral index criterion @xmath3 or @xmath4 at redshifts @xmath5 2 to 3 .",
    "we extracted these quasars from the hewitt & burbidge catalog ( hewitt & burbidge @xcite ) , using radio spectral data from the literature .",
    "although our sample is not complete , having its size restricted by the observing time allocation , we are confident that it is representative of the population of powerful flat - spectrum radio - loud quasars at high redshift . table  1 lists general information on the sample .",
    "most of the radio spectral indices are in the range 0.3  0.5 , while three objects with inverted spectral slope appear . due to radio core variability at cm wavelengths ",
    "common in these objects  and non - simultaneity of the measurements , the spectral index values will be mildly variable . on the basis of the information presented in sect .",
    "2.3 however it must be concluded that such variability would not affect our sample selection .    optical qso positions ( b1950 ) were extracted from the literature or the cambridge apm facility ( http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/@xmath6apmcat/ ) .",
    "one particularly inaccurate position , for , was remeasured from a newly obtained r - band image of the qso field , using apm star positions .",
    "columns 3 and 4 of table  1 list the optical qso positions .",

    "the inferred 5  ghz radio luminosities of these objects would be in the range p@xmath11 whz@xmath9 .",

    "are the relative strengths of their radio cores and their morphological ( a)symmetry and overall size . variability data ( e.g. , factors of two on time scales of years ) lead to brightness temperatures in excess of @xmath58k , pointing towards beamed core emission ( e.g. , kellermann & pauliny - toth @xcite ) . to this",
