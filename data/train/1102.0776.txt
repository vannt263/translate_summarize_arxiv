    "the study of plane partitions , a three - dimensional generalization of partitions , has a long history of more than a century in mathematics @xcite .",
    "there has recently been a renewed interest in this old topic , both among mathematicians and physicists alike , due to the pioneering discovery that topological a - model @xcite on toric calabi - yau manifolds @xcite can be described by a statistical mechanical model of plane partitions @xcite . in more mathematical language ,",
    "plane partitions count donaldson - thomas ( dt ) invariants @xcite , whose partition function is equivalent @xcite to that of the gromov - witten invariants under suitable parameter identifications .    there is an interesting twist to this story , which is the topic of more recent studies in this field .",
    "there we study `` generalized donaldson - thomas invariants '' @xcite , which depend on moduli ( mathematically stability conditions , or physically complexified khler moduli ) .",
    "these `` invariants '' are invariant under a generic deformation of moduli , but can jump when we cross real codimension loci ( called walls of marginal stability , which divide the moduli space into chambers ) in the moduli space .",
    "this jumping is called the wall crossing phenomena , and there are general formulas @xcite which govern this jumping phenomena .",
    "generalized dt invariants are indeed generalizations of the original dt invariants , in the sense that the former coincide with the latter only in a specific chamber ( hereafter called the topological string chamber ) of the moduli space .    given the richness of these new invariants , the natural question is whether there are combinatorial counterparts to this geometric story .",
    "the goal of the present article is to provide an answer to this question .",
    "generalized dt invariants on toric calabi - yau manifolds are described by a statistical mechanical model of `` crystal melting '' @xcite , formulated here as an enumeration problem of plane partitions and their generalizations .",
    "we will also comment on the equivalence with a vicious walker model , following @xcite .",
    "no prior knowledge in this field is assumed , and this paper is intended to be self - contained , at least as far as the combinatorial aspects are concerned .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we define our combinatorial partition function as a sum over suitable evolution of partitions . in section 3",
    "we comment on the representation of the partition function as a unitary matrix integral .",
    "the derivation of this matrix integral is given in section 4 , based on an equivalence with a vicious walker model .",
    "appendix contains an introduction to generalized donaldson - thomas invariants , which readers can consult for geometric side of the story .",
    "we begin with the following theorem , which states that the partition function for generalized dt invariants @xmath0 ( see appendix ) on a toric calabi - yau manifold can be computed exactly by purely combinatorial methods :     + for a toric calabi - yau manifold , the partition function for generalized dt invariants can be written as @xmath1 where the statistical mechanical model in the right hand side can equivalently formulated as ( 1 ) a crystal melting model ( a configuration of molten atoms ) , ( 2 ) dimer model , or ( 3 ) a generalization of plane partitions ( an evolution of partitions ) .",
    "the goal of this section is to define @xmath2 , using the plane partitions and their generalizations .",
    "we use the third formulation , developed in @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for the first and the second description .",
    "as we discussed in the introduction , the lhs of the equation depends on the value of the moduli .",
    "correspondingly , rhs also has moduli dependence , and we have different statistical mechanical models for different chambers of the moduli space .",
    "the schematic relation should be interpreted this way .",
    "let us begin with standard notations .",
    "a partition @xmath3 is a non - increasing sequence of integers @xmath4 such that @xmath5 for sufficiently large @xmath6 .",
    "the length @xmath7 of a partition @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 .",
    "we define a transpose @xmath10 by @xmath11 this is simply a graphical transpose of a partition , as will be clear from the following example .    for @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "given two partitions @xmath8 and @xmath15 , we define @xmath16 if and only if @xmath17 we also denote @xmath18 if and only if @xmath19 , or equivalently @xmath20    two partitions @xmath12 and @xmath21 both satisfy @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "now we define a plane partition ( also called a 3d partition ) as a sequence of partitions @xmath24 such that @xmath25 and @xmath26 when @xmath27 sufficiently large .",
    "define the length @xmath28 of a plane partition @xmath29 to be @xmath30 .",
    "note that this is a finite sum by the assumption above .",
    "our partition function is defined by @xmath31 as is well - known , macmahon s formula represents this as an infinite product @xmath32 which is the same as the generalized dt partition function for @xmath33 @xcite : is related to the topological string coupling constant @xmath34 by @xmath35 .",
    "] @xmath36 for this reason we hereafter denote the lhs of the above equation by @xmath37 .",
    "in the definition of a plane partition we could have used @xmath38 instead of @xmath39 .",
    "this has the effect of replacing @xmath40 by @xmath41 , and the partition function is the same either way .",
    "the choice of the weight in is the same as in the schur process of @xcite .",
    "we have seen that plane partitions correspond to the simplest calabi - yau geometry @xmath33 .",
    "our next task is to consider a set of partitions corresponding to the ( resolved ) conifold .",
    "we again consider a sequence of partitions @xmath29 , but now with a slightly different interlacing conditions , with plus and minus appearing alternatingly : @xmath42 for such a @xmath43 , we define @xmath44 and similarly @xmath45 . the conifold partition function",
    "is then defined by @xmath46 then in this example states that @xmath47 under the parameter identification @xmath48 infinite product expression for this partition function is known @xcite from the study of the topological string : , where @xmath34 is the topological string coupling constant , and @xmath49 is the khler moduli of the resolved conifold . ]",
    "@xmath50 the corresponding statement for @xmath51 was shown combinatorially in @xcite .",
    "the discussion above is a little bit imprecise because we did not specify the moduli dependence of the generalized dt invariants .",
    "we therefore consider the following more general partition function which includes the moduli dependence and applies to more general toric geometries .",
    "first , fix an integer @xmath52 and a function @xmath53 .",
    "we can periodically extend @xmath54 to a map @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is a set of half - integers .",
    "this will determine a toric calabi - yau geometry .",
    "second , to fix a moduli dependence , we define a bijection @xmath57 such that actually covers only half of the chambers , but sufficient for our purposes here .",
    "the partition function becomes a finite product in the remaining half . ]",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath59 we then define a generalized plane partition of type @xmath60 ( whose totality we are going to denote by @xmath61 ) to be a sequence of partitions @xmath29 such that @xmath62 we define @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "we also define @xmath65 where we used @xmath66 for @xmath67 by extending @xmath68 periodically , @xmath69 note that @xmath70 .",
    "the partition function is defined by @xmath71    let us take @xmath72 , @xmath73 and then the only choice for @xmath74 is @xmath75 , and reduces to .",
    "this means @xmath76 .",
    "take @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath74 can in general written as @xmath80 when @xmath81 , is the same as , and the partition function coincides with .",
    "the case of @xmath82 corresponds to generalized dt invariants in other chambers .",
    "the corresponding partition function is given by @xcite ( again under the identification ) @xmath83 in particular , in the limit @xmath84 , this coincides with the commutative dt partition function for the conifold @xcite .",
    "in this limit our statistical mechanical model reduces to the gluing of two crystal corners ( topological vertices ) as in @xcite .",
    "the general story goes as follows .",
    "we can construct from @xmath85 a toric calabi - yau manifold @xmath86 , which is one of the so - called generalized conifolds .",
    "this is a toric calabi - yau manifold without compact 4-cycles , and has a connected string of @xmath87 @xmath88 s .",
    "each @xmath88 is either a @xmath89-curve or a @xmath90-curve , depending on @xmath91 or @xmath92 .",
    "does not change the geometry . in , this has the effect of replacing @xmath39 by @xmath93 .",
    "as discussed previously in the case of @xmath33 , this does not change the partition function , but will change the matrix model representation of the partition function presented in the next section . ]",
    "we can then consider the partition function of generalized dt invariants on @xmath86 .",
    "the remaining task is to specify the moduli dependence , which in this case is given by an element of the weyl group of the affine lie algebra @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding partition function is denoted by @xmath95 .",
    "now the following theorem states that this partition function is the same as the crystal partition function of type @xmath60 :    @xmath96    where the parameter identifications are given by . see @xcite and section 3.5 of @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath97    we can consider further generalizations , by changing the boundary conditions at infinity .",
    "this generalized model counts `` open generalized donaldson - thomas invariants '' . see @xcite .    in the following we concentrate on the case of @xmath33 and the resolved conifold",
    "in the following sections we show that the crystal melting partition function defined in the previous section can be written as a unitary matrix integral :    @xmath98    where @xmath99 is the haar measure of the unitary group and @xmath100 [ thm3.1 ]    @xmath101    where @xmath102 and @xmath103 where the measure @xmath99 and the function @xmath104 are the same as in theorem 3.1 . [ thm3.2 ]    we shall give derivations of these results in the next section , but before going there some comments are in order .",
    "theorem [ thm3.1 ] and theorem [ thm3.2 ] for @xmath105 are not new , although @xmath82 case has not previously appeared in the literature as far as the author is aware of .",
    "theorem 3.1 seems to be well - known in the literature , and can be considered as a reduction of a multi - matrix model in @xcite . for theorem 3.2 with @xmath105 ,",
    "see the paper @xcite , which also proves similar identities for other groups .",
    "a vicious walker model similar to the one for the conifold presented in the next section was also discussed in @xcite . in their terminology @xmath106 ( @xmath38 ) are called `` normal '' ( `` super '' ) time evolution , and the model is analyzed by identifies involving semi - standard young tableaux and hook schur functions ( also called supersymmetric schur functions ) .",
    "they also analyze the scaling limit of the model .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "the prefactor @xmath107 simplifies in the limit @xmath105 and @xmath108 ; @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "in particular in these cases @xmath107 is independent of @xmath111 .",
    "@xmath112 , being a partition function of a unitary matrix integral , is a reduction of a @xmath113-function of a two - dimensional integrable toda chain @xcite ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "similar integrable structures appeared in topological strings context in @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for the appearance of thermodynamic bethe ansatz equations in the study generalized dt invariants .",
    "finally , let us discuss the thermodynamic limit of our model , using the matrix integral given above .",
    "the thermodynamic limit is the limit @xmath114 , where the string coupling constant @xmath34 is related to the parameter @xmath115 by @xmath116 . of a generalized plane partition @xmath43 . ] for small @xmath34 , the modular transformation of @xmath117 with respect to @xmath34 gives @xmath118 if we ignore non - perturbative terms in @xmath34 , this means that the matrix model @xmath119 reduces to a hermitian gaussian matrix model with unitary measure .",
    "this result was originally derived from the chern - simons theory on the conifold @xcite ( see also @xcite for crystal melting description ) .",
    "the spectral curve for this gaussian matrix model is given by the equation @xcite @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the t hooft coupling .",
    "this is the mirror of the resolved conifold . in the limit of @xmath122 ( which we should take since @xmath123 ) ,",
    "the curve reduces to @xmath124 which is the mirror of @xmath33 .",
    "next we discuss the spectral curve for the conifold matrix model .",
    "as before , we take the limit @xmath125 with @xmath126 fixed , but now we also take @xmath84 , with @xmath127 fixed . the spectral curve is given by @xcite @xmath128 where @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "this is the mirror @xcite of the so - called closed vertex geometry , whose web diagram is shown in figure [ closedvertex ] .",
    "there are two interesting observations on this result .",
    "first , coincides with the mirror map for this geometry .",
    "second , the curve ( [ conifoldcurve ] ) is symmetric under exchanges of @xmath111 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "namely , ( 1 ) the original khler moduli @xmath111 of the resolved conifold , ( 2 ) the chamber parameter @xmath6 and ( 3 ) the t hooft parameter @xmath133 appear symmetrically in the spectral curve .",
    "this is an interesting result , which suggests a possible connection between continuum limit of the wall crossing formulas and the bcov holomorphic anomaly equation @xcite .    in the matrix model",
    "we are interested in the limit of @xmath134 , which means @xmath135 or equivalently @xmath136",
    ". with appropriate shifts of @xmath137 and @xmath138 , the equation ( [ conifoldcurve ] ) in this limit becomes @xmath139 the is the mirror of the so - called suspended pinched point ( spp ) geometry , with @xmath111 and @xmath15 being exponentials of flat coordinates representing sizes of its two @xmath88 s , which encode two copies of the initial @xmath140 geometry , see figure [ spp ] .",
    "not only does the spectral curve agree with the mirror curve of the spp geometry in the limit of @xmath141 , but in fact the matrix integral reproduces the full topological string partition function all orders in @xmath34 expansion .",
    "indeed , it is known that the spp topological string partition function , in the conifold ] with khler parameters @xmath111 and @xmath15 , is equal to @xmath142 on the other hand , from the explicit structure of the bps generating function and formulas ( [ zbps - n - conifold ] ) , ( [ eq4.3 ] ) , ( [ cnconifold ] ) and ( [ conifoldmatrix ] ) , we find that the value of the matrix integral , in the @xmath143 limit , is related to the above topological string partition function as @xmath144 this result is consistent with the philosophy of the remodeling conjecture @xcite , which states that a set of invariants ( symplectic invariants ) @xcite constructed recursively from the spectral curve coincide with topological string partition function on the same geometry .",
    "since symplectic invariants are defined by rewriting loop equations of matrix models purely in the language of spectral curves , the fact that the topological string partition function can be written as a matrix model would prove the remodeling conjecture .",
    "indeed , this type of logic was used in @xcite to prove the remodeling conjecture for toric calabi - yau manifolds .",
    "it would be interesting to know whether similar recursion relations exist in other chambers .",
    "there are at least two derivations of the above - mentioned matrix models , one using the vertex operator formalism for free fermions @xcite ( see @xcite for discussion our context ) and another using the equivalence with a vicious walker model ( non - intersecting paths ) .",
    "both are presented in @xcite . here",
    "we comment on the latter method in the case @xmath75 .",
    "the derivation here is a slightly simplified version of the derivation in @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite , which constructs similar matrix models in a particular chamber .",
    "in particular @xcite treats arbitrary toric calabi - yau geometries .",
    "let us fix a sufficiently large number @xmath145 .",
    "this is the same @xmath145 for the size of the unitary matrix in the previous section , and in the end we take the limit @xmath123 .",
    "define @xmath146 since @xmath147 is a partition , we have @xmath148 for all @xmath49 .",
    "we also have the boundary condition , @xmath149 moreover , means we have , for each step @xmath49 , @xmath150 for @xmath151 and @xmath152 for @xmath153 .",
    "suppose that we fix a large positive ( negative ) integer @xmath154 ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "we are going to send these numbers of infinity .",
    "if we plot the value of @xmath156 for each @xmath157 , we have a set of @xmath145 paths . due to the conditions , the paths move on the graph shown in figure [ c3path ] , and means we have a fixed boundary condition .",
    "finally , means that @xmath145 paths are non - intersecting . summing up",
    ", we have a statistical mechanical model of non - intersecting paths ( also called a vicious walker model @xcite particles in one dimension . in this language",
    "the model is an exclusion process , a variant of the asep @xcite . ] ) , whose partition function is given by : @xmath158 where @xmath159 shows that we neglected an overall multiplicative constant .    at first sight",
    "it seems difficult in practice to implement the non - intersecting conditions for paths .",
    "the following theorem states that we can write the sum over non - intersecting paths as a determinant of a matrix , whose element is defined by a single path :    suppose we are given an oriented graph without oriented loops .",
    "suppose moreover that each edge @xmath160 comes with a weight @xmath161 .",
    "for a path @xmath162 on the graph , we define @xmath163 to be the product of the weighs for all the edges on the path : @xmath164 .",
    "we define @xmath165 by summing over all non - intersecting paths @xmath166 ( each @xmath167 starts from @xmath168 and ends at @xmath169 ) : @xmath170 and an @xmath171 matrix @xmath172 by @xmath173 then @xmath174 [ lgv ]    when we expand the determinant @xmath175 , we have contributions from non - intersecting as well as intersecting paths .",
    "however , contributions from the latter cancel out because they always come in pairs with an opposite sign ( figure [ lgvproof ] ) .",
    "consider an oriented graph with weights @xmath176 as shown in figure [ lgveg ] .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath177 and @xmath178 we indeed have @xmath179 .",
    "the fact that paths are non - intersecting is a manifestation of free fermions , and the determinant is interpreted as a slater determinant .",
    "therefore we have @xmath180 where @xmath181 is defined as a weighted sum over all possible paths which start at height @xmath182 at @xmath183 and end at height @xmath184 at @xmath185 .",
    "as we can see from figure [ c3path ] , @xmath186 depend only on the difference @xmath187 , and we thus have @xmath188    it turns out to be easier to write a generating function for @xmath189 than to write each @xmath189 separately : @xmath190    to see this , note that a term in the expansion of the product is in one - to - one correspondence with a path .",
    "for example , for @xmath191 we take either @xmath192 or @xmath193 from the product , and the choice corresponds to the two possibilities in .",
    "the change of the horizontal coordinates is measured by @xmath194 , and taking the coefficient in front of @xmath195 means summing paths with height change @xmath6 .",
    "the product in is over all non - negative integers @xmath6 when we send @xmath196 .",
    "finally , we have the following theorem :    suppose that @xmath197 .",
    "we then have @xmath198 [ heine ]    the rhs of the equation is often called a toeplitz determinant of @xmath199 .",
    "diagonalize the unitary matrix @xmath200 to be @xmath201 .",
    "then the integral @xmath202 reduces to @xmath203 , while the integrand becomes a product @xmath204 .",
    "after expanding the two determinants using the definition of the determinant , we can easily carry out the integral , and the result follows .",
    "this theorem , together with the form of @xmath205 in , completes the derivation of the matrix model for @xmath33 .",
    "the analysis for the conifold is essentially the same , so let us summarize the result briefly . by defining @xmath206 again as in , we again have and , except that , are going to be replaced by    1 .   when @xmath49 is odd , @xmath207 2 .   when @xmath49 is even , @xmath208 for @xmath209 and @xmath210 for @xmath211 .",
    "these conditions mean @xmath212 move on the graph shown in figure [ conifoldpath ] .",
    "note that the structure of the graph is different depending on whether @xmath49 is even or odd .",
    "[ conifoldpath ]    again by using theorems [ lgv ] and [ heine ] , we have @xmath213 where @xmath214 this is nothing but the expression for @xmath105 .",
    "the author would like to express his gratitude to the organizers and the participants of the workshop for creating a stimulating atmosphere .",
    "the material here was presented also at a seminar at the ipmu , university of tokyo , and the feedback from the audience there is greatly acknowledged .",

    "this work was supported in part by jsps postdoctoral fellowships for young scientists , mext , japan , and by princeton center for theoretical science .",
    "in this appendix we briefly summarize the ingredients of the generalized donaldson - thomas invariants .",
    "our discussion in this section is far from rigorous and at best schematic , since the main focus of this paper is more on combinatorial aspects presented in the main text . for the definition of generalized dt invariants ,",
    "we need the following :    * @xmath215 : a calabi - yau 3-fold . * a `` charge lattice '' : @xmath216 * complexified khler moduli of @xmath215 : @xmath217 where the real part @xmath218 ( imaginary part @xmath219 ) denotes the b - field flux through ( the volume of ) the @xmath182-th 2-cycle . * a central charge function @xmath220 , which depend on @xmath221 and linearly on @xmath222 .",
