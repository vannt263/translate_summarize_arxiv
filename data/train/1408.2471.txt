    "the discussion in @xcite , and the absence of stagnation points excludes the possibility of a flow - reversal .",
    "these flows represent significant examples of rotational waves and our purpose is to pursue their in - depth study .",
    "we present a penalization method that selects from the family of solutions to a reformulation of the governing equations genuine waves .",
    "this permits us to provide accurate simulations of the surface water wave but also of the main flow characteristics ( fluid velocity components , pressure ) beneath it .",
    "in this section we present the governing equations for periodic travelling water waves in a flow of constant vorticity over a flat bed .",
    "we briefly discuss the reformulation from @xcite that leads , by means of bifurcation theory , to the existence of waves of small and large amplitude .",
    "let us first discuss the governing equations for two - dimensional waves travelling at constant speed and without change of shape at the surface of a layer of water above a flat bed , in a flow of constant vorticity .",
    "two - dimensionality means that the waves propagate in a fixed horizontal direction , say @xmath0 , and the flow presents no variation in the horizontal direction orthogonal to the direction of wave propagation . for this reason",
    ", it suffices to analyse a vertical cross - section of the flow , parallel to the direction of wave propagation . to model sea waves of large amplitude the assumptions of inviscid flow in a fluid of constant density are appropriate and the effects of surface tension are negligible ",
    "see the discussion in @xcite .",
    "the assumption of a flat bed @xmath1 is also reasonable for a considerable proportion of the earth s sea floor .",
    "consequently , the cross - section of the fluid domain is of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the wave speed , @xmath4 is the average depth and @xmath5 is the free surface . setting the density of the water @xmath6 , the incompressible euler equations for the velocity field @xmath7 and the pressure @xmath8 are @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the gravitational constant of acceleration .",
    "since the flow is periodic in the @xmath0-variable , we may assume that the period is @xmath11 , after performing the rescaling @xmath12 in terms of the actual wavelength @xmath13 .",
    "in a frame moving at the ( constant ) wave speed , obtained by means of the change of variables @xmath14 we can restrict our attention to the two - dimensional bounded domain @xmath15 bounded above by the free surface profile @xmath16 and below by the flat bed @xmath17 since @xmath18 represents the average depth , the waves oscillate around the flat free surface @xmath19 , that is @xmath20 where @xmath21 . setting @xmath22 ( [ euler - eqs - old ] ) can be written as @xmath23 the boundary conditions that select from the solutions to ( [ ee ] ) those that represent water waves read as follows @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the constant atmospheric pressure .",
    "the first condition reflects the fact that surface tension effects are negligible and permits the decoupling of the water motion from the air flow above it , while the second and third condition express the fact that the free surface and the flat bed are interfaces , with no flow possible across them  see the discussion in @xcite .",
    "an essential flow characteristic is the vorticity @xmath26 , which is indicative of underlying currents .",
    "vanishing vorticity is the hallmark of uniform currents and a constant vorticity characterizes the linearly sheared tidal currents . with respect to the flow beneath the waves ,",
    "we restrict our attention to flows for which @xmath27 this condition prevents the appearance of stagnation points in the flow and the occurrence of flow - reversals .",
    "structural properties of the governing equations ( [ ee])-([bc ] ) enable us to reduce the number of unknowns .",
    "we first introduce the _ _ relative mass flux__. ] @xmath28 since the first equation in ( [ ee ] ) and the last two equations in ( [ bc ] ) show that @xmath29 is independent of @xmath30 , while ( [ ns ] ) determines the sign .",
    "the first equation in ( [ ee ] ) permits us to introduce the stream function @xmath31 as the unique solution of the differential equations @xmath32 subject to @xmath33 note that @xmath31 is periodic in the @xmath30-variable , and that the third equation in ( [ bc ] ) is consistent with the constraint ( [ bs ] ) .",
    "moreover , ( [ ds ] ) and the definition of vorticity yield @xmath34 the first equation in ( [ bc ] ) is equivalent to @xmath35 being constant on @xmath36 , while ( [ mf ] ) together with ( [ bs ] ) ensure that this constant must vanish , that is , @xmath37 on the other hand , due to ( [ ds ] ) , we see that we can re - express the euler equation in ( [ ee ] ) by the fact that the expression @xmath38 equals a constant @xmath39 throughout @xmath40 .",
    "the constant @xmath41 is called the hydraulic head .",
    "the previous considerations show that the governing equations ( [ ee])-([bc ] ) can be reformulated in terms of the stream function as the free - boundary problem @xmath42 given @xmath43 , we seek values of @xmath18 and @xmath44 for which ( [ str ] ) admits a smooth solution @xmath31 , even and of period @xmath11 in the @xmath30-variable .",
    "evenness reflects the requirement that @xmath45 and @xmath46 are symmetric while @xmath47 is antisymmetric about the crest line @xmath48 ; here , we shift the moving frame to ensure that the wave crest is located at @xmath48 .",
    "symmetric waves present these features and it is known that a solution with a free surface @xmath36 that is monotone between crest and trough has to be symmetric , cf .",
