    "studies of x  ray spectra of seyfert 2 galaxies above a few kev ( awaki & koyama 1993 ; salvati et al .",
    "1997 ) have revealed the presence of highly obscured nuclei with power law spectra and fe k@xmath2 lines similar to seyfert 1 objects lending further support to the popular ` unification ' models for active galactic nuclei ( agns ) ( antonucci 1993 and references therein ) . in these models",
    "the viewing angle explains most of the observed differences among seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 galaxies in terms of absorption by circumnuclear matter , possibly a molecular torus . if the orientation is such that the line of sight intercepts the torus , the optical / uv radiation including the broad lines as well as the soft x ",
    "rays from the nucleus are blocked and the object is classified as a type 2 .",
    "a fraction of the order of a few percent of the nuclear radiation can be detected in scattered light , the scattering medium being a warm plasma visible to both the nucleus and the distant observer .",
    "the origin and the physical state of such a reflecting mirror are poorly known at present ; this is unfortunate , as the mirror is a key component of the unified model ( krolik & kallman 1987 ) and several features originating from it are expected in x  rays ( krolik & kriss 1995 ; matt , brandt & fabian 1996 ) , which should be observable at energies where the torus completely blocks the nuclear radiation .",
    "however , despite extensive studies of seyfert 2 galaxies with _ rosat _ in the soft x  ray band ( mulchaey et al . 1993 ; turner et al .",
    "1993 ) the relatively low spectral resolution of the pspc and the weakness of seyfert 2 galaxies in the 0.13.0 kev energy range hampered detailed investigations of the soft component .",
    "ngc 4507 is a nearby ( @xmath4 = 0.011 ) barred spiral galaxy , it was classified as a sbab(rs)i by sandage & brucato ( 1979 ) .",
    "optical spectra of the nucleus show emission lines characteristic of a seyfert 2 type without any detectable broad line component ( durret & bergeron 1986 ) . the relatively high luminosity in the o@xmath5iii@xmath6 $ ] line ( @xmath3 6.5 @xmath7 10@xmath8 ergs s@xmath9 ; mulchaey et al .",
    "1994 ) , which is though to be a good indicator of the luminosity of the active nuclei , suggests the presence of a powerful source of ionizing radiation .",

    "the source position in sis1 was slightly offset from the nominal value .",
    "for this reason a fraction of the order of 2030 per cent of the source flux was lost in the gap between the chips . following a software  related problem on board _ asca _",
    "the data collected from the gis3 were corrupted .",
    "as they could not be easily recovered , they were therefore excluded from the analysis . in the following with gis",
    "we refer to gis2 data only .",
    "all the sis data were collected in faint telemetry mode , which maximises the ccd spectral resolution .",
    "the following criteria have been applied for the selection of good times intervals : the spacecraft was outside the south atlantic anomaly , the elevation angle from the earth s limb was @xmath12 5 degrees , the minimum bright earth angle was @xmath12 25 degrees , the magnetic cutoff rigidity was greater than 6 gev c@xmath9 for sis data and greater than 7 gev c@xmath9 for gis data . ` hot ' and flickering pixels were removed from the sis data , and rise - time rejection was applied to exclude particle events for the gis data .",
    "sis grades 0,2,3 and 4 were considered for the analysis .",
    "finally a short period of unstable pointing at the phase of target acquisition was removed manually . after applying",
    "the above selection criteria , 25 ks for each sis and 40 ks for the gis detector were collected .",
    "we fit the gis and sis data above 3 kev with an absorbed power law plus a narrow gaussian line .",
    "the best fit energies in the three instruments are in good agreement .",
    "since the gain of sis and gis were within 1 per cent of their nominal values , the source spectrum can be considered substantially not affected by instrumental gain offset .",

    "the star is detected at the edge of the other ccd chip while is barely visible in the sis1 .",

    "smith model ( @xmath23 1 kev ) provides a good fit to the data with some evidence of excess flux at higher energies suggesting that contamination effects between the two sources may be relevant . for this reason we have considered in the subsequent gis analysis only counts at energies greater than 3 kev .",
    "circular extraction cells of radius @xmath3 3.5 arcmin for sis and @xmath3 4 arcmin for gis centered on ngc 4507 were used , with corresponding background regions defined in source  free areas of the same ccd chip for sis and from calibration background regions ( blanksky ) for gis .",

    "source plus background light  curves were accumulated for all the instruments showing no clear evidence for variability .",
    "gis and sis spectra were binned with more than 20 counts per bin in order to apply @xmath25 statistics .",
    "the response matrices , effective areas and xrt psf used were those released with the latest version of ftools ( 3.6 ) . since the spectral parameters obtained by fitting an absorbed power law plus a soft component to the sis0 and sis1 spectra were all consistent at the @xmath3 90 per cent level and the residuals from those fits were very similar , we have added the two sis spectra . in the overlapping energy range ( 310 kev )",
    "the gis spectrum is consistent with the sis results except for a slight mismatch ( @xmath26 10 per cent ) in the relative normalizations . in the following the spectral results are referred to the combined sis0+sis1 spectrum simultaneously fitted with the gis2 one , leaving the relative normalizations free to vary . unless explicitly stated all the quoted errors correspond to 90 per cent confidence intervals for one interesting parameter ( @xmath27 = 2.71 ) .",
    "the continuum emission requires at least two components : an heavily absorbed hard x  ray power law at high energies and a soft component below @xmath3 3 kev .",
    "however , this model does not provide an adequate fit to the data .",
    "two line  like excesses are clearly visible in the data / model ratio around 6.4 kev , indicative of iron k@xmath2 emission ( a feature commonly seen in seyfert galaxies , nandra & pounds 1994 ; mushotzky et al .",

    "if the soft photon index is forced to be the same of the hard one the fit is slightly worse as some flux excess is present in the 0.50.7 kev region .",
    "a possible interpretation of this excess as a blend of unresolved oxygen lines is discussed below .",
    "an inherent limitation of the _ asca _ data is that the complexity of the spectrum in terms of absorption and emission lines features hampers a precise estimate of the spectral slope .",
    "for this reason in the following we assume that the slope of the scattered power law is equal to the hard one ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "a combination of a thermal model and a power law for the soft spectrum clearly improves the fit owing to the greater number of free parameters .",

    "there is no improvement in the fit .",
    "we note that , even with such a complex model , the line  like feature at 0.9 kev is not completely accounted for ( unless neon abundances are left free to vary ) and , moreover , the residuals below @xmath3 0.8 kev are steeply increasing towards lower energies ( fig .",
    "the shape of the residuals below @xmath3 3 kev and the evidence of a line  like excess at @xmath3 0.9 kev suggests , instead ( see below ) , that ionized absorption / reflection of the nuclear radiation by a warm scattering mirror could be important in the modelling of the soft x  ray spectrum .",
    "it should be noted that the putative ionized absorber has significant effects only on the soft scattered component , while the hard x  ray emission is absorbed by almost neutral material as described in the previous section .",
    "a composite cold plus warm absorber model has been fitted to the overall spectrum of ngc 4507 using the absori model available in xspec 9.0 . given the relatively large number of free parameters of the warm absorber model we have fixed the temperature of the warm material at @xmath51 k (",
    "the temperature dependence in this model is very weak in the range @xmath52 k ) , the iron abundance at the solar value and the slope of the primary power law at the same value of the hard component as is expected if the soft emission is scattered into our line of sight by the warm mirror .",

    "the evidence of highly ionized material that leaves significant imprints on the 0.1 - 10 kev spectrum of seyferts galaxies and quasars is by now widely recognized and , thanks to the _ asca _ capabilities , ` warm absorbers ' have been clearly detected in several seyfert 1 and quasars ( fiore et al .",
    "1993 ; otani et al . 1996 ; reynolds 1997 ) .",
    "several theoretical models have been developed to explain the observed features ( e.g. netzer 1996 and references therein ) .    when the ionized gas lies on the line of sight , as for seyfert 1 objects , absorption features of the oxygen edges at 0.74 and 0.87 kev are usually the most evident characteristics , while the strongest lines when observed against the direct continuum have typical equivalent widths of a few tens of ev at most , so that are difficult to detect with the present detectors .",
    "much larger equivalent widths for the emission lines are expected if the central continuum source is obscured as in the case of seyfert 2 galaxies ( e.g. netzer 1996 ) .",
    "we therefore interpret the observed feature around 0.9 kev we have detected in the spectrum of ngc 4507 as an emission line ( parametrized as a gaussian ) from warm material out of the line of sight , i.e. the same material responsible for the scattering of the continuum . in figures 4 and 5 the contour plots of the line energy vs. normalization ( with the line width set to zero ) and vs. the width ( when permitted to vary ) are shown .",
    "the best fit line energy suggests the identification of this feature with k@xmath2 emission from he - like neon ( 0.92 kev ) .",
    "if the reflecting matter would be optically thin to all processes , the expected ew would be ( see matt et al .",
    "1996 for the relevant formulae ) about 6 kev ( assuming solar abundances and a fraction of neix of 0.40.5 ) , resonant scattering accounting for about 90 per cent of it , to be compared with an observed ew of more than one order of magnitude smaller ( table 2 and 3 ) .",
    "however , matter becomes optically thick to resonant scattering when @xmath68 a few 10@xmath69 and to photoabsorption when @xmath70 at the edge energy , and at a value five times smaller at the line energy . because for these values of the column density compton scattering is still optically thin , line ews are largely dimmed ( matt et al .",
    "if the @xmath71 is actually of order of 10@xmath17 , as suggested by the amount of scattered continuum photons , equivalent widths of the order of the observed one can be attained .",
    "a further reduction in the line strength arises from the fact that the line or , better , the resonant and intercombination lines , is resonantly trapped in the medium and may be eventually destroyed by photoabsorption by an oxygen atom .",
    "the exact value of the line ew depends on several physical and geometrical details , and its precise evaluation is beyond the scope of this paper . note that a strong he - like oxygen line at 0.57 kev is also to be expected .",
    "unfortunately , the sis efficiency at that energy is rather poor and prevents a detailed study of this feature ; in any case , the obtained upper limit of o / ne @xmath3 45 is consistent with the expectation .",
    "another possible explanation for the @xmath30.9 kev feature is in term of recombination on ground state of completely stripped oxygen , following a photoionization of an oviii atom .",
    "the threshold energy is 0.87 kev , which is inconsistent at the 3@xmath72 level with the observed line energy ( fig .",
    "4 ) .    however",
    ", the recombination feature should have a line  like appearance only if the temperature of the matter is much lower than the threshold energy ; but with a temperature of 10@xmath73 k , not impossible in photoionized plasma , the width of the feature should be not negligible and still consistent with the observation ( fig .",
    "5 ) , with the centroid energy shifted towards higher energy . assuming , as usual , photoionized plasma , the expected ew in the optically thin case is ( for solar abundances and a fraction of oviii of 0.4 - 0.5 ) about 2 kev . again , this ew diminishes with the column density , and again values similar to that observed can be obtained for columns of the order of 10@xmath17 @xmath1 . in this case a recombination line at 0.65 kev from oviii , with a similar equivalent width , is also to be expected .",
    "the obtained 90 per cent upper limit to such a line is about 50 ev . at these column densities , however , such a line got resonantly trapped and may be eventually destroyed by photoabsorption by for example cvi , which may help explaining the low intensity of this line with respect to the recombination continuum .",
    "obviously a final possibility is that both neix and the oviii lines can contribute to the observed emission .",
    "in fact , despite the fact that the ionization potentials of neviii and ovii are quite different ( as in the last ion the ionization should involve a k instead than l electron ) , it is possible to have both ions rather abundant at the same time ( see e.g. nicastro et al .",
    "1997 ) .    with the values of the column density of the warm matter as derived by both the amount of reflected continuum and the equivalent width of the 0.9 kev feature ( whatever its origin ) , a substantial re  absorption of the scattered photons is expected . as the matter responsible for both the photons emission and absorption is the same , the adoption , for the fitting procedure , of a warm screen in front of the line and continuum emitting region , as we have done in the previous section , may be not completely appropriate to the physical situation under investigation .",
    "a self  consistent grids of models taking into account also emission and reflection processes in ionized plasmas , such as those computed using e.g. cloudy or xstar would probably be more appropriate .",
    "we note , however , that the physical picture obtained using absori plus a gaussian line at @xmath3 0.9 kev is in overall good agreement with much more detailed calculations ( krolik & kriss 1995 ; netzer 1996 ) , and that , in any case , the quality of the data is not such to permit an unambiguous determination of all the parameters .",
    "interestingly , the derived value of the absorbing column density is of the same order of that derived for the reflector , giving a check of our hypothesis that the reflector and the absorber are one and the same material .",
    "the line ew is now somewhat greater , but of the same order of magnitude , than in the previous case .",
    "the best fit ionization structure of the absorbing matter suggests that h  like oxygen and neon ions are dominating over he  like ions , consistent with the oviii recombination line hypothesis for the 0.9 kev feature .",
    "observations with instruments with higher energy resolution and sensitivity , like axaf , xmm and astro  e , are clearly requested to clarify this issue .",
    "galaxies where the star formation rate greatly exceed the average rate of normal galaxies are called starburst galaxies .",
    "their optical spectra are characterized by intense narrow emission lines due to a recent episode of star formation and strong infra ",
    "red emission probably due to dust reprocessing of the radiation from hot stars .",
    "heated gas is expected to emit in the x  ray band with luminosities a few order of magnitude lower than those usually observed for seyfert galaxies ( see serlemitsos et al .",
    "1997 for a recent review ) however when the emission of the agn is obscured as in the case of seyfert 2 galaxies the starburst component could provide an important contribution to the soft x  ray emission .",
    "an estimate of the expected x ",
    "ray luminosity from the starburst component can be obtained from the far infrared luminosity ( david , jones & forman 1992 ) .",
    "given a fir luminosity of ngc 4507 of @xmath3 1.1 @xmath7 10@xmath11 ergs s@xmath9 the expected 0.5 - 4.5 kev luminosity is @xmath3 7.8 @xmath7 10@xmath74 ergs s@xmath9 ( equation 1 in david et al .",
    "1992 ) , while the observed luminosity of the soft component in the same energy band is @xmath3 2.2 @xmath7 10@xmath8 ergs s@xmath9 , i.e. about a factor three greater .",
    "this result suggests that the thermal component may account only for a relatively small fraction ( @xmath26 30 per cent ) of the observed soft x ",
    "ray luminosity .",
    "previous _ rosat _ and _ asca _ observations of starburst galaxies ( i.e. makishima et al .",
    "1994 ; moran & lehnert 1997 ) have shown that the soft x  ray emission below 2 kev is frequently extended over a region greater than 1 arcmin in extent .",
    "a pointed pspc observation of ngc 4507 has been retrieved from the public archive .",
    "the source is rather weak with an observed 0.52.0 kev flux of @xmath3 3 @xmath7 10@xmath75 ergs @xmath1 s@xmath9 consistent with the value derived from our _ asca _ analysis in the same energy range .",
    "the image is consistent with a pointlike source at the pspc spatial resolution of @xmath3 25 arcsec to be compared with the extent of the optical image ( @xmath76 arcmin ) .",
    "the lack of any extended emission and the spectral analysis results indicate that the contribution of a starburst component , if present , plays a minor role for explaining the soft x ",
    "ray emission of ngc 4507 .",
    "the main results of the _ asca _ observation of the bright seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 4507 can be summarized as follows :    @xmath77 the hard ( @xmath12 3 kev ) power law slope ( @xmath78 ) lies at the flatter ",
    "end of the seyfert 1 photon index distribution . the continuum is strongly absorbed at few kev by a column density @xmath79 @xmath1 . the iron line intensity ( ew @xmath80 190 @xmath24 40 ev )",
    "is consistent with transmission through cold matter with such a column density .",
    "@xmath77 the soft x  ray spectrum is rather complex and can not be approximated with a single component .",
    "a scattered power law plus emission from hot thermal gas provide an acceptable description of the soft x  ray continuum , but several features",
    "are left in the residuals . a thermal component possibly due to a starburst would in any case account for @xmath26 30 per cent of the soft x  ray flux .",
    "@xmath77 reflection and self  absorption in a photoionized plasma provide a better description of the overall soft x  ray spectrum .",
    "a line feature at 0.9 kev is clearly detected , probably due to the neix k@xmath2 recombination , even if some contribution from the oviii recombination continuum can not be excluded .",
    "note that the presence of visible soft emission line is seyfert 2 s are expected ( matt et al .",
    "1996 ; netzer 1996 ) , and have probably already been detected by _ asca _ in other seyferts like mkn 3 ( iwasawa et al . 1994 ) , ngc 4051 ( guainazzi et al . 1996 ) and ngc 4388 ( iwasawa et al .",
    "1997 ) , as well as in the well known seyfert 1.5 ngc 4151 ( leighly et al . 1997 ) .",
    "a broad band observation over the full x  ray domain from 0.1 to several tens of kev , like that will be performed by bepposax , would allow a better estimate of the relative contribution of the scattered radiation from the warm gas and the starburst component .",
    "a more detailed study of the warm absorption / reflection requires good energy resolution and sensitivity ; _ axaf _ , _ xmm _ and _ astro  e _ will surely improve significantly our understanding of these phenomena .",
