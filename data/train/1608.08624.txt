    "there is compelling observational evidence for the existence of dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy ( de ) in the universe .",
    "the suggestion that dm may constitute a large part of the universe was raised by zwicky @xcite in 1933 . using the virial theorem to infer the average mass of galaxies within the coma cluster",
    ", he obtained a much higher value than the mass of luminous material .",
    "he realized therefore that some mass was `` missing '' to account for the observations .",
    "the existence of dm has been confirmed by more precise observations of rotation curves @xcite , gravitational lensing @xcite , and hot gas in clusters @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", de is responsible for the ongoing acceleration of the universe revealed by the high redshift of type ia supernovae treated as standardized candles @xcite .",
    "recent observations of baryonic acoustic oscillations provide another independent support to the de hypothesis @xcite . in both cases (",
    "dm and de ) more indirect measurements come from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and large scale structure observations @xcite .",
    "the variations in the temperature of the thermal cmb radiation at @xmath1k throughout the sky imply @xmath2 and @xmath3 , while the power spectrum of the spatial distributions of large scale structures gives @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the effective curvature of spacetime , @xmath6 is the present mass density in the relativistic cmb radiation ( photons ) accompanied by the low mass neutrinos that almost homogeneously fill the space , and @xmath7 is the current mean mass density of nonrelativistic matter which mainly consists of baryons and nonbaryonic dm .",
    "these observations give a value of @xmath8 for the present de density @xcite .",
    "one of the most fundamental problems in modern cosmology concerns the nature of dm and de . in the last decades",
    ", various dm and de models have been studied .",
    "the simplest model of dm consists in particles moving slowly compared to the speed of light ( they are cold ) and interacting very weakly with ordinary matter and electromagnetic radiation .",
    "these particles , known as weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , behave as dust with an equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "they may correspond to supersymmetric ( susy ) particles @xcite . on the other hand , the simplest manner to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe is to introduce a cosmological constant @xmath10 in the einstein equations @xcite . in that case , the value of the energy density @xmath11 stored in the cosmological constant represents the de .",
    "the standard model of cosmological structure formation in the universe is known as the cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant ( @xmath10cdm ) @xcite .",
    "cosmological observations at large scales support the @xmath10cdm model with a high precision .",
    "however , this model has some problems at small ( galactic ) scales for the case of dm @xcite .",
    "in particular , it predicts that dm halos should be cuspy @xcite while observations reveal that they have a flat core @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath10cdm model predicts an over - abundance of small - scale structures ( subhalos / satellites ) , much more than what is observed around the milky way @xcite .",
    "these problems are referred to as the `` cusp problem '' and `` missing satellite problem '' .",
    "the expression `` small - scale crisis of cdm '' has been coined .",
    "furthermore , the value of the cosmological constant @xmath10 assigned to de has to face important fine tuning problems @xcite . from the point of view of particle physics , the cosmological constant",
    "can be interpreted naturally in terms of the vacuum energy density whose scale is of the order of the planck density @xmath12 . however , observationally , the cosmological constant is of the order of the present value of the hubble parameter squared , @xmath13 , which corresponds to a dark energy density @xmath14 .",
    "the planck density and the cosmological density differ from each other by @xmath15 orders of magnitude .",
    "this leads to the so - called cosmological constant problem @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath10cdm model poses problems , some efforts have been done in trying to understand the nature of dm and de from the framework of quantum field theory . in particle physics and string theory , scalar fields ( sf ) arise in a natural way as bosonic spin-@xmath16 particles described by the klein - gordon ( kg ) equation @xcite .",
    "examples include the higgs particle , the inflaton , the dilaton field of superstring theory , tachyons etc .",
    "sfs also arise in the kaluza - klein and brans - dicke theories @xcite . in cosmology",
    ", sfs were introduced to explain the phase of inflation in the primordial universe @xcite .",
    "sf models have then been used in cosmology in various contexts and they continue to play an important role as potential dm and de candidates .    for example , the source of de can be attributed to a sf .",
    "a variety of sf models have been infered for this purpose ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "quintessence , which is the simplest case , is described by an ordinary sf minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "it generally has a density and eos parameter @xmath17 that vary with time , hence making it dynamic @xcite .",
    "by contrast , a cosmological constant is static , with a fixed energy density and @xmath18 .",
    "phantoms fields are associated to a negative kinetic term .",
    "this strange property leads to an eos parameter @xmath19 implying that the energy density increases as the universe expands @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that , in a class of string theories , tachyonic sf can condensate and have cosmological applications .",
    "tachyons have an interesting eos whose parameter smoothly interpolates between @xmath20 and @xmath16 , thus behaving as de and pressureless dm @xcite .",
    "sf models describing de usually feature masses of the order of the current hubble scale ( @xmath21 ) @xcite .",
    "concerning dm , it has been proposed that dm halos can be made of a sf described by the klein - gordon - einstein ( kge ) equations ( see , e.g. , @xcite for reviews and @xcite for high resolution numerical simulations showing the viability of this scenario ) . in general , sfdm models suppose that dm is a real or complex sf minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "this sf can be self - interacting but it does not interact with the other particles and fields , except gravitationally . sf",
    "that interact only with gravity could be gravitationally produced by inflation @xcite .",
    "the sf may represent the wave function of the bosons having formed a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) .",
    "the kge equations describe a relativistic sf / bec .",
    "general relativity is necessary to describe compact sf objects such as boson stars @xcite and neutron stars with a superfluid core @xcite .",
    "it is also necessary in cosmology to describe the phase of inflation and the evolution of the early universe @xcite .",
    "however , in the context of dm halos , newtonian gravity is sufficient .",
    "the evolution of a nonrelativistic sf / bec is described by the gross - pitaevskii - poisson ( gpp ) equations .",
    "there are several models of sfdm , e.g. noninteracting ( fuzzy ) dm @xcite , self - interacting dm @xcite , or axionic dm @xcite .",
    "most of these models are based on the assumption that dm is made of extremely light scalar particles with masses between @xmath22 . within this mass scale ,",
    "sfdm displays a wave ( quantum ) behavior at galactic scales that could solve many of the problems of the @xmath10cdm model .",
    "indeed , the wave properties of bosonic dm may stabilize the system against gravitational collapse , providing halo cores and sharply suppressing small - scale linear power .",
    "this may solve the cusp problem and the missing satellite problem .",
    "therefore , the main virtues of the sf / bec model is that it can reproduce the cosmological evolution of the universe for the background and behave as cdm at large scales where its wave nature is invisible , while at the same time it solves the problems of the cdm model at small scales where its wave nature manifests itself .    in quantum field theory ,",
    "ultralight sfs seem unnatural but renormalization effects tend to drive these scalar masses up to the scale of a new physics . given the present observational status of cosmology , and despite all the efforts that have been made , it is fair to say that the nature of dm and de remains a mystery . as a result",
    ", the sf scenario is an interesting suggestion that deserves to be studied in more detail .    instead of working directly in terms of field variables , a fluid approach can be adopted . in the nonrelativistic case ,",
    "this hydrodynamic approach was introduced by madelung @xcite who showed that the schrdinger equation is equivalent to the euler equations for an irrotational fluid with an additional quantum potential arising from the finite value of @xmath23 and accounting for heisenberg s uncertainty principle .",
    "this approach has been generalized to the gpp equations in the context of dm halos by @xcite among others . in the relativistic case ,",
    "de broglie @xcite in his so - called pilot wave theory , showed that the kg equations are equivalent to hydrodynamic equations including a covariant quantum potential .",
    "this approach has been generalized to the klein - gordon - poisson ( kgp ) and kge equations in the context of dm halos by @xcite . in this hydrodynamic representation ,",
    "dm halos result from the balance between the gravitational attraction and the quantum pressure arising from the heisenberg uncertainty principle or from the self - interaction of the bosons . at small scales , pressure effects are important and can prevent the formation of singularities and solve the cusp problem and the missing satellite problem . at large scales ,",
    "pressure effects are generally negligible ( except in the early universe ) and one recovers the @xmath10cdm model .",
    "the formation of large - scale structures is an important topic of cosmology .",
    "this problem was first considered by jeans @xcite ( before the discovery of the expansion of the universe ) who studied the instability of an infinite homogeneous self - gravitating classical collisional gas ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "this study has been generalized in the context of sf theory .",
    "the jeans instability of an infinite homogeneous self - gravitating system in a static background was studied by @xcite for a relativistic sf described by the generalized kgp equations , using the field representation .",
    "the same problem was studied in @xcite for a nonrelativistic sf described by the gpp equations in the context of newtonian cosmology , and in @xcite for a relativistic sf described by the kge equations , using the hydrodynamic representation .",
    "the growth of perturbations of a relativistic real sf in an expanding universe was considered in @xcite using the field representation .",
    "the same problem was addressed in @xcite for a complex sf using the hydrodynamic representation .",
    "analytical results @xcite were obtained in the ( nonrelativistic ) matter era where the background universe has an einstein - de sitter ( eds ) evolution .",
    "the matter era is valid at sufficiently late times . at earlier times",
    ", the sf affects the background evolution of the universe so we can no more assume that the scale factor follows the eds solution .",
    "the classical evolution of a real sf described by the kge equations with a potential of the form @xmath24 in an isotropic and homogeneous cosmology was first investigated by turner @xcite ( see also the subsequent works of @xcite ) .",
    "he showed that the sf experiences damped oscillations but that , in average , it is equivalent to a perfect fluid with an eos @xmath25\\epsilon$ ] ( this result is valid if we neglect particle creation due to the time variation of @xmath26 ) . for @xmath27",
    "the sf behaves as pressureless matter and for @xmath28 it behaves as radiation .",
    "turner also mentioned the possibility of a stiff eos .",
    "the cosmological evolution of a spatially homogeneous real self - interacting sf described by the kge equations competing with baryonic matter , radiation and dark energy was considered by @xcite . in this work , it is found that a real self - interacting sf displays fast oscillations and that , on the mean , it undergoes a radiationlike era followed by a matterlike era . in the noninteracting case , the sf undergoes only a matterlike era @xcite . in any case , at sufficiently late times , the sf reproduces the cosmological predictions of the standard @xmath10cdm model .",
    "the cosmological evolution a complex self - interacting sf representing becdm has been considered by @xcite who solved the ( relativistic ) friedmann equations with the equation of state of the bec derived from the ( nonrelativistic ) gp equation after identifying @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the rest - mass density , with the energy density @xmath31 . however , as clarified in @xcite , this approach is not valid in the early universe as it combines relativistic and nonrelativistic equations .",
