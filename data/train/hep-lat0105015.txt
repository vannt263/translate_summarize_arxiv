    "the mass spectrum of hadrons represents a fundamental manifestation of the long - distance dynamics of quarks and gluons governed by qcd .",
    "non - perturbative calculations through numerical simulations on a space - time lattice  @xcite provide a method to obtain this quantity from the qcd lagrangian without approximations .",
    "such calculations also lead to a determination of the light quark masses  @xcite , which are fundamental constants of nature and yet not directly measurable in experiments .",
    "these reasons underlie the large number of attempts toward the hadron spectrum carried out since the pioneering studies of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "most of these calculations employed the quenched approximation of ignoring sea quarks , since dynamical quark simulations incorporating their effects place quite severe demands on computational resources .",
    "significant advance has been made over the years within this approximation .",
    "in particular , weingarten and collaborators  @xcite made a pioneering attempt toward a precision calculation of the spectrum in the continuum limit through control of all systematic errors other than quenching within a single set of simulations .",
    "this approach was pushed further in ref .",
    "@xcite where the precision of the calculation reached the level of a few percent for hadron masses . scrutinized with this accuracy",
    ", the quenched hadron spectrum shows a clear and systematic deviation from experiment ; when one uses @xmath24 and @xmath7 meson masses as input to fix the physical scale and light quark masses , the @xmath25 hyperfine splitting is too small by about 10% compared to the experimental value , the octet baryon masses are systematically lower , and the decuplet baryon mass splitting is smaller than experiment by about 30% .",
    "clearly further progress in lattice calculations of the hadron mass spectrum requires a departure from the quenched approximation .",
    "in fact simulations of full qcd with dynamical quarks have a long history @xcite , leading up to the recent efforts of refs .  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to quenched simulations , however , no attempt to control all of the systematic errors within a single set of simulations has been made so far . except for the work of the milc collaboration  @xcite , employing the kogut - susskind quark action , previous calculations have been restricted to a few quark masses within a small range and/or a single value of the lattice spacing . furthermore , until recently , statistics have been rather limited due to the limitation of available computing power .    in the present work ,",
    "we wish to advance an attempt toward simulations of full qcd which includes extrapolations to the chiral limit of light quark masses and the continuum limit of zero lattice spacing .",
    "this is an endeavor demanding considerable computing resources , which we hope to meet with the use of the cp - pacs parallel computer with a peak speed of 614  gflops developed at the university of tsukuba  @xcite .",
    "we explore , as a first step toward a realistic simulation of qcd , the case of dynamical up and down quarks , which are assumed degenerate , treating the strange quark in the quenched approximation .",
    "preliminary results of the present work have been reported previously  @xcite .",
    "a crucial computational issue in this attempt is how one copes with the large amount of computation necessary in full qcd , and still covers a range of lattice spacings required for the continuum extrapolation .",
    "we deal with this problem with the use of improved lattice actions , which are designed to reduce scaling violations , and hence should allow a continuum extrapolation from coarse lattice spacings .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have carried out a preparatory study on the efficiency of improved actions in full qcd . based on the results from this study we employ a renormalization group improved action  @xcite for the gauge field and a mean field improved sheikholeslami - wohlert clover action  @xcite for the quark field . with these actions ,",
    "hadron masses show reasonable scaling behavior and the static quark potential good rotational symmetry , at a coarse lattice spacing of @xmath26  fm , as compared to the range @xmath27  fm needed for the standard plaquette and wilson quark actions .",
    "this leads us to make a continuum extrapolation from the range of lattice spacings @xmath260.1  fm .",
    "previous studies of finite size effects ( see , _ e.g. , _ refs .",
    "@xcite ) indicate that physical lattice sizes larger than @xmath283.0  fm are required to avoid size - dependent errors in hadron masses .",
    "compromising on a lattice of physical size @xmath28  fm leads to a @xmath3 lattice at @xmath26  fm , and @xmath5 at @xmath29  fm .",
    "estimates of cpu time obtained in our preparatory study  @xcite show that simulations on such a set of lattices are feasible with the full use of the cp - pacs computer .",
    "since we employ the quenched approximation for strange quark , the calculation of the strange spectrum requires the introduction of a valence strange quark which only appears in hadron propagators .",
    "we generalize this treatment and analyze hadron masses as functions of valence and sea quark masses regarded as independent variables .",
    "the benefit of this approach is that it gives us better control over the whole spectrum ( strange and non - strange ) and its cross - over from quenched to full qcd when the mass of the underlying sea quark is decreased .",
    "there are a number of physics issues we wish to explore in our full qcd simulation .",
    "an important question is whether effects of dynamical quarks can be seen in the light hadron spectrum . in particular",
    "we wish to examine if and to what extent the deviation of the quenched spectrum from experiment established in our extensive study with the standard plaquette and wilson quark actions  @xcite can be explained as effects of sea quarks . answering this question requires a detailed comparison with hadron masses in quenched qcd for which we use results of ref .",
    "we also carry out a set of new quenched simulations with the same rg - improved gluon action and the clover quark action as employed in the simulation of full qcd in order to make a point - to - point comparison of full and quenched qcd at the same range of lattice spacings .",
    "another question concerns light quark masses . quenched calculations of light quark masses",
    "have made considerable progress in recent years  @xcite .",
    "it has become clear  @xcite that the quenched estimate for the strange quark mass extrapolated to the continuum limit suffers from a large systematic uncertainty of order 20% depending on the choice of hadron mass for input , _",
    "@xmath7 meson mass or @xmath11 meson mass .",
    "this is a reflection of the systematic deviation of the quenched spectrum from experiment .",
    "it is an important issue to examine how dynamical quarks affect light quark masses and resolve the systematic uncertainty of strange quark mass .",
    "a recent attempt at a full qcd determination of light quark masses  @xcite was restricted to a single lattice spacing .",
    "we extracted light quark masses through analyses of hadron mass data obtained in the spectrum calculation .",
    "the main findings of our light quark mass calculation have been presented in ref .",
    "we give here a more detailed report of the analysis and results .",
    "full qcd configurations generated in this work can be used to calculate a large variety of physical quantities and examined for sea quark effects .",
    "we have already pursued calculations of several quantities . among these , the flavor singlet meson spectrum and its relation with topology and @xmath30 anomaly is of particular interest from the theoretical viewpoint , and preliminary results have been published in ref .  @xcite .",
    "other calculations concern the prediction of hadronic matrix elements important for phenomenological analyses of the standard model .",

    "the agreement for @xmath43 is not fortuitous ; the one - loop value for the rg gauge action ( [ eq:6linkact ] ) , which was calculated  @xcite after the present work was started , equals @xmath46 , which differs from our choice @xmath47 only by a few per cent .",

    "still , this work would have been difficult without the cp - pacs computer with a peak speed of 614 gflops . with a typical sustained efficiency for configuration generation of 3040%",
    ", the total cpu time spent for the present work equals 415 days of saturated use of the cp - pacs , of which 318 days were for configuration generation and 84 days for measurements .",
    "a major physics issue we addressed with our simulation was the origin of a systematic discrepancy of the quenched spectrum from experiment  @xcite .",
    "our new quenched simulation employing the same improved actions as for full qcd has quantitatively confirmed the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for both mesons and baryons .    for mesons , masses in two - flavor full qcd",
    "become much closer to experiment than those in quenched qcd . using the @xmath7 meson mass to fix the strange quark mass ,",
    "the difference between quenched qcd and experiment of @xmath8% for the @xmath9 meson mass and of @xmath10% for the @xmath11 meson mass is reduced to @xmath12% and @xmath13% in full qcd . when the @xmath11 meson mass is used as input ,",
    "the difference in the @xmath9 meson mass is less than 1% for both quenched and full qcd , while the deviation from experiment for the @xmath7 meson mass is reduced from @xmath408% in quenched qcd to @xmath409% in full qcd .",
    "similarly the @xmath14 parameter takes a value @xmath16 in two - flavor full qcd , which is much closer to the experimental value @xmath17 compared to @xmath15 in quenched qcd .",
    "we take these results as evidence of sea quark effects in the meson spectrum .    a common point in reaching this conclusion",
    "is the importance of continuum extrapolation .",
    "differences between quenched and full qcd meson masses are less obvious at finite lattice spacings but the slope of the continuum extrapolation is different between them .",
    "unexpectedly , the scaling violation for full qcd is apparently larger than for quenched qcd with the same improved actions . a possible origin of this feature is the common choice of @xmath410 we made for the two cases while the correct @xmath410 necessary to remove @xmath368 scaling violations need not be the same .",
    "full qcd baryon masses exhibit the pattern that the difference from experiment increases with decreasing strange quark content .",
    "while masses of @xmath18 and @xmath19 are in agreement with experiment , the nucleon mass differs most from experiment among the octet , being larger by 10% , and the @xmath20 among the decuplet by 13% .",
    "this pattern of disagreement suggests that finite - size effects sizably distort light baryon masses for an @xmath6  fm spatial size employed in our study .",
    "we leave detailed finite - size analyses in full qcd for future investigations , however .",
    "the sea quark effects in the meson sector have an interesting consequence that the light quark masses decrease by about 25% in two - flavor full qcd compared to quenched qcd .",
    "an inconsistency of 2030% in the strange quark mass for quenched qcd , depending on the particle used as input , disappears in full qcd within the errors of 510% .",
    "in contrast to the encouraging results above , meson decay constants exhibit large scaling violations which obstruct a continuum extrapolation .",
    "we have found this trend to be common through light pseudoscalar and vector decay constants of this work as well as in heavy - light decay constants  @xcite .",
    "possibly this problem arises from two - loop and higher order corrections in the renormalization factors not included in our analyses .",
    "an indication for this explanation is given by a much flatter behavior of vector meson decay constants when using a non - perturbative renormalization factor derived from a conserved vector current .",
    "while we consider that the present work has brought sizable progress in our effort toward fully realistic simulations of qcd , it is also clear that a number of gaps have to be filled in future studies .",
    "one of them is an examination of finite - size effects , particularly for baryons .",
    "another is the exploration of lighter values of sea quark masses below @xmath411 for better control of the chiral extrapolation , and generation of data at more points in the lattice spacing for a better control of continuum extrapolations .",
    "important in the latter context will be the use of non - perturbative improvement coefficients and renormalization factors .",
    "finally , the inclusion of a dynamical strange quark will be necessary to remove the last uncontrolled approximation .",

    "we quote errors determined with the jack - knife method with a bin size of 10 configurations or 50 hmc trajectories .",
    "in quenched simulations masses of hadrons with different quark content are obtained from the same gauge configurations and are therefore correlated .",
    "often the quality of data does not allow a correlated chiral extrapolation and it is usual practice to resort to uncorrelated fits . by using the jack - knife method errors of fit parameters can still be correctly determined .    at first sight the situation seems simpler for full qcd with valence quarks equal to sea quarks .",
    "separate runs have to be made for different sea quark masses , and are manifestly uncorrelated . errors on parameters of chiral fits can be correctly calculated from an uncorrelated @xmath288 fit .",
    "nevertheless , the jack - knife method is extremely useful even in this case .",
    "since the fit parameters are often highly correlated , the determination of the error of derived quantities can not be made with naive error propagation .",
    "the jack - knife method takes such correlations into account correctly .",

    "combined fits according to the method of sec .",
    "[ sec : chiral ] have correlations between some of the data , and therefore one is in a similar situation to quenched qcd .    a difference from quenched qcd",
    "is that there are as many sets of gauge configurations as sea quarks in the simulation .",
    "they are mutually independent and can differ in number between runs with various sea quarks .",
    "a generalization is implemented in the following way .",
    "first , hadron masses are determined with the usual jack - knife method .",
    "this yields mass estimates @xmath412 for each jack - knife ensemble obtained by omitting the gauge configuration number @xmath413 from the run with sea hopping parameter number @xmath414 .",
    "mean values and variances are defined by @xmath415 chiral fits are then carried out by replacing mean values @xmath416 with jack - knife estimates @xmath417 for the sea hopping parameter number @xmath414 while keeping masses at all other sea hopping parameters at their mean value .",
    "this procedure gives error estimates @xmath418 as above where @xmath157 stands for a fit parameter or a quantity derived from fit parameters .",
    "since runs at different sea quarks are uncorrelated , the total error @xmath419 is determined by quadratic addition @xmath420 .",
    "errors quoted throughout this paper are determined with this method .",
    "in this appendix we summarize renormalization factors and improvement coefficients used in the calculation of matrix elements and quark masses .",
    "perturbative calculations to one loop have been carried out in refs .",
