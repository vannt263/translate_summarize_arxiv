    "our sample galaxies are unlikely to have thin , dynamically cold disks , since for dwarfs in this luminosity range the gas velocity dispersion is typically comparable in magnitude to the rotation velocity @xcite . a threshold for star formation in dwarf galaxies may still exist as a consequence of a critical amount of dust shielding required for molecular gas to form @xcite .",

    "it should be noted that ( 1 ) ir fluxes are available for only 7 galaxies in our sample @xcite and ( 2 ) @xcite have shown that dwarf galaxies have low but non - zero dust content .",
    "internal dust extinction can in principle be estimated from comparing the ir and uv fluxes ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* etc . ) , or the fuv to nuv color ( * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* etc . ) .",
    "infrared fluxes are not available for all our sample galaxies , but nuv data is available for 22 galaxies in our sample ( i.e. except for and  iv ) , and figure  [ fig : col ] shows the disk averaged fuv - nuv colors as a function of the hi mass in the optical disk .",
    "star - forming galaxies with low extinction are expected to have fuv - nuv color close to zero ; our sample galaxies however typically have redder colors , with an average fuv - nuv color of 0.34 .",
    "redder colors could also be the result of a fading star burst , or a truncated imf @xcite .",
    "these issues have been explored in depth by @xcite who found similarly red uv colours for their sample of low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "@xcite model the variation of fuv - nuv color with time for different upper cut - offs of mass for the imf and different metallicities . from their results",
    "it appears that either the imf has to be truncated , or the colors have to be dominated by a fading starburst to reproduce the observed colors , both of which would bring our results closer to the kennicutt - schmidt relation .",
    "for example , fuv - nuv color of 0.34 would be observed in a galaxy which ( 1 )  has a kroupa imf @xcite with metallicity = z@xmath17/20 , an age of 6.8@xmath2810@xmath27 years , and star formation was quenched after 10@xmath27 years or ( 2 )  has a kroupa imf truncated at 5m@xmath17 at the highend , solar metallicity , has been forming stars for 4.3@xmath2810@xmath27 years continuously or ( 3 )  has an age of 2.4@xmath2810@xmath27 years and star formation was quenched after 10@xmath27 years or ( 4 )  has kroupa imf , solar metallicity , an age of 2.4@xmath2810@xmath27 years and star formation was quenched after 10@xmath27 years . for galaxies in our sample ,",
    "fuv - nuv colours range from @xmath100.03 to @xmath100.8 , and hence the range of possible models is correspondingly larger . while we do nt explore this issue further , it should be noted that alternate imfs or star formation histories could lead to revision in the interpretation of our data .    while there have not been systematic earlier studies of star formation recipes for similarly faint galaxies , it is interesting to compare our results with what is already known for brighter dwarfs or large spiral galaxies .",
    "empirical studies of star formation thresholds have generally used the h@xmath5 luminosity as a tracer of the current star formation rate .",
    "the h@xmath5 luminosity is sensitive largely to stars with masses @xmath29  10 m@xmath17 and lifetimes @xmath30  20 myr ; one hence gets a measure of the instantaneous star formation .",
    "a study of spatially resolved star formation laws for regions of size @xmath10 500 pc in the spiral galaxy m51a @xcite which uses both h@xmath5 and infrared fluxes to estimate star formation , show very similar results to what we obtain here .",
    "there is no evidence of any obvious star formation threshold .",
    "interestingly the relation between sfr surface density and hi gas surface density is quite steep , but the power law index comes down to 1.56@xmath80.04 after taking molecular gas into account .",
    "@xcite did a multi - wavelength study of the spiral galaxy ngc  7331 .",
    "along with looking for an azimuthally averaged schmidt s law , they also show pixel by pixel correlations between @xmath0  and @xmath1 at different resolutions ( 400  pc and 1  kpc ) .",
    "their @xmath1  vs. @xmath25  plot looks strikingly similar to that for our galaxies , with a flat lower portion changing to a steep power law portion , which only reaches the kennicutt - schmidt law level at higher column densities .",
    "however , unlike the galaxies in our sample , ngc  7331 has a number of pixels lying above the level at which the kennicutt - schmidt relation holds . even after adding molecular gas to @xmath0 the plot remains qualitatively unchanged , except , as expected",
    ", the power law portion becomes less steep and @xmath1  for a large number of pixels fall below the kennicutt - schmidt law level .",
    "this is similar to what we expect to find on taking molecular gas into account for our sample . in another recent study ,",
    "boissier et al .",
    "@xcite look for evidence for a threshold density for star formation using _ galex _ uv fluxes as a measure of the star formation rate . similarly to the results presented here , they also do not find any evidence for a threshold below which star formation is completely quenched .",
    "finally , @xcite in a paper published after our manuscript was submitted , find results similar to ours when comparing the global @xmath1  to @xmath0  for a sample of lsb galaxies .    a similar pixel by pixel correlation study ( at 220 pc linear resolution ) was done for the magellanic clouds by @xcite .",
    "the star formation rate in that case was traced by h@xmath5 emission .",
    "the ( @xmath1,@xmath0 ) scatter plot in @xcite is qualitatively similar to those in the current paper ; the power law indices that they find are @xmath31 for the lmc and @xmath32 for the smc . in a recent paper ,",
    "@xcite study the relation between the star formation rate density and the gas column density in a sample of 18 nearby galaxies at @xmath10 750 pc resolution using data from the things survey .",
    "their sample covers a range of galaxy types , including dwarfs , but they do not present pixel by pixel correlations for galaxies fainter than the figgs magnitude limit of @xmath1914.9 . for the 4 irregular galaxies for which they do fit a power law , they find power law indices that vary from 1.59 to 2.78 .",
    "they also find that the `` star formation efficiency '' ( i.e. @xmath1/@xmath0 ) is lower in dwarfs and the outer parts of spirals than in the inner , h@xmath11 dominated regions of spiral galaxies .",
    "this is similar to our finding that the sfr in dwarfs is lower than that predicted from the @xcite relation .",
    "they also find that the gas density in dwarfs truncates sharply at about 9m@xmath17/pc@xmath12 .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : hst ] the distribution of column densities at both 400 pc and 200 pc resolutions ( the data from ugc  685 was not included while calculating the distribution of column densities at 400 pc resolution , as it is unique in having some gas at column densities between @xmath33 and @xmath34 m@xmath17 pc@xmath13 , and it was nt imaged at 200 pc resolution ) .",
    "the 400 pc resolution data does indeed show a fall off in the amount of gas at column densities more than @xmath35 m@xmath17/pc@xmath12 , however at the higher resolution , one can see a tail in the distribution that extends to @xmath36 m@xmath17/pc@xmath12 .",
    "it would appear that dense hi gas occurs in small clumps whose density gets smoothed out when one observes with a coarser resolution .    @xcite compared the morphology of the h@xmath5 emission and the hi emission ( at 300 pc resolution ) in a sample of 10 similarly faint dwarf galaxies .",
    "although the h@xmath5 emission generally occurred near the central regions where the gas column density is high , no one to one relation between the hi column density and the gas column density was found .",
    "one possible explanation for this observation is stochasticity in the h@xmath5 based estimates of @xmath1 .",
    "there are two reasons why uv based estimates of @xmath1would be less susceptible to stochastic fluctuations than h@xmath5 based ones , viz .",
    "( 1 )  as mentioned above h@xmath5 emission traces essentially the instantaneous star formation rate , while uv emission traces the star formation rate over the last @xmath37 years , and ( 2 )  stochasticity in the formation of high mass stars becomes more important at the low star formation rates that we probe here @xcite .",
    "@xcite study a similar phenomena observed in the outer portion of disk galaxies , where uv traces star formation beyond the observed h@xmath5 cut - off .",
    "they show that a local formulation of the concept of clustered star formation naturally leads to a steeper decrease in the h@xmath5 luminosity as compared to @xmath1 and hence the h@xmath5 cut - off arises naturally . in a recent theoretical study",
    "@xcite suggest that massive stars , the likes of which are responsible for h@xmath5 emission , can only form when the gas column density is 1 g cm@xmath13 or higher . but",
    "even if the @xmath0  is not so extreme , lower mass stars as traced by uv will continue to form , and hence uv based and not h@xmath5 based @xmath1  should be used to look for star formation  thresholds  .",
    "one of our principal findings is that the @xmath1  that we find are lower than those predicted from relations based on observations of the central regions of galaxies ( viz .",
    "the `` kennicutt  schmidt '' relation ) .",
    "this suggests that the star formation efficiency is environment dependent , and proceeds differently in dwarf galaxies than in central regions of spirals . at small ( i.e. 200 pc ) scales offsets between the uv peaks and the hi peaks are more pronounced .",
    "possible reasons for this could be that the gas is predominantly molecular in star forming regions , or that at such small scales the feed back from star formation complicates the relation between @xmath1  and @xmath0 . in this context",
    "is interesting to note that ( 1 )  the @xmath1  approaches the value predicted by the @xcite relation at high gas densities , and ( 2 )  for those galaxies for which a power law parametrization is possible , the power law indices at 200 pc are flatter ( i.e. closer to that observed in the centers of spiral galaxies ) .",
    "note that the average measured gas density is higher in the 200 pc maps than the 400 pc maps ( see fig  [ fig : hst ] , table  [ tab : res ] ,  [ tab : res200 ] ) .",
    "these facts are consistent with a scenario that when star formation does occur in dense clouds , there is , initially at least , a near universal relation between @xmath1  and @xmath0 .",
    "feedback and other effects may lead to a break down of this relation , depending on the exact evolutionary phase at which the observations are made .",
    "even in such a scenario , dwarfs could have a lower average star formation efficiency both because sufficiently dense regions are rarer , and because the effects of feedback are more important .",
    "a proper test of this scenario would require higher angular resolution observations of a diverse sample of star forming galaxies .",
    "some of the data presented in this report were obtained from the multimission archive at the space telescope science institute ( mast ) .",
