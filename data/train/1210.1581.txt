    "the dynamics of interacting multi - agent or swarming systems in various biological and engineering fields is actively being studied .",
    "these systems are remarkable for their ability to self - organize into very diverse , complex spatio - temporal patterns .",
    "these studies have numerous biological applications with widely varying spatial and temporal scales . among them",
    "are bacterial colonies , schooling fish , flocking birds , swarming locusts , ants , and pedestrians @xcite . in engineering",
    ", these studies have investigated systems of communicating robots @xcite and mobile sensor networks @xcite .",
    "a fundamental problem for the engineering of systems of autonomous , communicating agents is the design of agent - interaction protocols to achieve robotic space - time path planning , consensus and cooperative functions , and other forms of spatio - temporal organization .",
    "a fruitful approach has resulted from applying the tools developed in the study of swarms in various biological and physical contexts to aid in the design of algorithms for systems of communicating robots .",
    "this has led to the successful use of a combination of inter - agent and external potentials to obtain agent organization and cooperation ; however , it must be ensured that the results from these methods are scalable with respect to the number of agents .",
    "important applications comprise the following : obstacle avoidance @xcite , boundary tracking @xcite , environmental sensing @xcite , decentralized target tracking @xcite , environmental consensus estimation @xcite and task allocation @xcite .",
    "an important aspect that must be accounted for in the design of algorithms for the spatio - temporal organization of communicating robotic systems is that of time delay .",
    "time delay arises in latent communication between agents , information processing times , hardware malfunction , as well as actuation lag times due to inertia .",
    "time delays in robotic systems are important in the areas of consensus estimation @xcite and task allocation , where , for example , there is a time delay as a consequence of the time required to switch between different tasks @xcite .",
    "previous work has shown the big impact that time delays may have in the dynamics of a system , such as destabilization and synchronization @xcite . moreover ,",
    "time delays have been used with success for control purposes @xcite .",
    "the initial studies considered at most a few discrete time delays that are constant in time .",
    "recent studies have extended the aforementioned investigations to consider randomly selected time delays @xcite and distributed time delays , i.e. , when the time evolution of the system is affected by its history over an extended time interval in its past , instead of at a discrete instants @xcite .",
    "robust algorithms for task planning with inter - agent and environmental interactions need to account for the presence of noise at all levels in the system .",
    "noise in the swarm s dynamics introduces higher complexity in the behavior and may produce transitions from one coherent pattern to another , something that may be detrimental to the algorithm s purposes or , to the contrary , that may be exploited to escape unwanted states @xcite .    here ,",
    "we investigate a swarming model where the coupling between agents occurs with randomly distributed time delays .",
    "we show that the attractive coupling , non - uniform , random time delays and external noise intensity combine to produce transitions between different coherent patterns .",
    "remarkably , we show that under certain conditions , noise produces transitions that increase the phase space coherence of the particles .",
    "we study the spatio - temporal dynamics of a two dimensional system of @xmath0 agents under the effects of two forces : self - propulsion and mutual attraction .",
    "we consider that the attraction between agents occurs in a time delayed fashion due to finite communication speeds and processing times .",
    "the dynamics of the particles is described by the following governing dimensionless equations : @xmath1 for @xmath2 . the 2d position and velocity vectors of particle @xmath3 at time @xmath4",
    "are denoted by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the self - propulsion of agent @xmath3 is modeled by the term @xmath7 .",
    "the quantity @xmath8 is called the coupling constant and measures the strength of attraction between agents . at time @xmath4 , agent @xmath3 is attracted to the position of agent @xmath9 at the past time @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath11 different time delays @xmath12 are distributed according to a distribution @xmath13 whose mean is @xmath14 and whose standard deviation is @xmath15 .",
    "in contrast to some of our recent work , here we allow that @xmath16 ; i.e. , time delays are not symmetric among pairs of agents @xcite .",
    "the form of our model is based on the normal form for particles near a supercritical bifurcation corresponding to the onset of coherent motion @xcite .",
    "in addition , the functional form of the attractive terms may be thought of as representing the first term in a taylor series around a stable equilibrium point of a more general time - delayed potential .",
    "various models of this form have been extensively used to study the motion of swarms @xcite .",

    "specifically , we find that when there is bistability of the ring and rotating state , there is a critical value of the noise intensity , @xmath33 , above which the swarm transitions from the ring state to the rotating state .",
    "in contrast , noise intensities below that critical value do not produce such a transition ; that is , no such transition has been observed within the limits of our long - time numerical simulations .",

    ", the initial state of the particles is considered to be at rest and the particles are randomly distributed on the unit square .",
    "the new state of the swarm at each time step is found by updating the stochastic system using heun s method . in all simulations",

    ", width=162,height=113 ]    in order to properly quantify the time required by the swarm to make this transition , we use a quantity called the mean alignment , which has been used in the past to describe the pattern adopted by the swarm as a whole @xcite .",
    "this quantity is defined as follows .",
    "if the velocity of particle @xmath9 makes an angle @xmath39 with the velocity of the center of mass , then the mean alignment is simply the ensemble average of the cosines of all of the angles @xmath39 , for @xmath40 .",
    "that is , @xmath41 which ranges from -1 to 1 .",
    "when all particles have perfectly aligned velocities , the mean alignment is equal to 1 , regardless of their location in space or the magnitude of the individual particles speeds .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the mean particle alignment as a function of time , for different values of the noise intensity and the time delay standard deviation .",
    "the four panels show how the swarm starts with very low values of the mean alignment , since it initially adopts the ring state .",
    "after some dwell time in the ring state , the noise causes the swarm depart from that state and converge to the rotating state , where the mean alignment is almost 1.0 .",
    "once the agents begin to depart from the ring state , the transition time required to complete the transition is very short compared to the dwell time .",
    "for the simulations shown , the dwell time decreases with increasing noise intensity ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a to [ fig2]b and fig .",
    "[ fig2]c to [ fig2]d ) and increases with increasing time delay standard deviation ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a to [ fig2]c and fig .",
    "[ fig2]b to [ fig2]d ) .    to better understand the onset of alignment due to noise",
    ", we probe different noise intensities for various choices of @xmath15 , with @xmath14 fixed , and then plot their asymptoptic mean alignment figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "each of the numerical experiments in figure [ fig3 ] was started in an initial state that , outside of the presence of noise , will stay indefinitely in the ring formation ( unaligned ) .",
    "the simulation was run out to @xmath42 , in order to allow transients to pass , and to ensure we capture any transition between the two states . as reported in @xcite",
    ", we do see a critical value of the noise intensity @xmath18 at which the noise drives the particles into the highly aligned rotating state .",
    "interestingly , as @xmath15 is increased , the location of the @xmath33 shifts so that a larger noise intensity is required to observe this transition .",
    "thus , we observe a dependence of the critical noise threshold on the distribution width of the delays .    , and for different values of the time delay standard deviation @xmath15 . each curve ( labeling different values of the standard deviation of the time delay ) has an extremely sharp transition that occurs at a critical value of the noise intensity @xmath33 ( @xmath43 ) . below the transition",
    "point the swarm converges to the ring state and remains there for times as long as our simulations permit .",
    "in contrast , above the critical noise value , the swarm transitions to the more coherent , rotating sate .",
    ", width=188,height=132 ]    further , as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , increasing @xmath15 also increases the amount of time the particles remain in the ring state before finally transitioning to the rotating state ( assuming @xmath18 is large enough for such a transition to occur ) . to better understand this observation",
    ", we do single runs for various values of @xmath15 and @xmath18 . for each simulation",
    ", we monitor when a threshold value of the mean alignment is reached , and then record that time as the ` dwell time ' .",
    "while these dwell time values , shown in figure [ fig4 ] , record only single events , they do indicate that , generally speaking , below the threshold value @xmath44 , we do not observe a transition out of the ring state , but for @xmath45 , we observe that the dwell time is highest near the threshold , and then rapidly decreases as @xmath18 is increased . as one continues to increase @xmath18 even further , the rotating state will gradually become more disorganized until noise dominates the entire system .",
    ", and the time delay standard deviation , @xmath15 . below the @xmath15-dependent , critical value of noise intensity , @xmath33 , the transition times diverge from the perspective of our long - time numerical simulations ( white region ) . above the value @xmath33 ,",
    "the transition times become finite and accessible to computation from numerical simulations .",
    ", width=188,height=132 ]",
    "we have considered the general problem of multi - agent swarms of particles where the communication is governed by a delay coupled potential field . in particular , we have considered the case where the delay coupling is fixed in time but randomly distributed from a chosen probability density .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that in many cases the delays in signal transmission and/or reception are caused by finite transmission times , processing and control delays , and the probability of dropped packets .",
    "modeling the swarm as a globally coupled delay system , we have considered the role of temporal noise due to fluctuations from external forces which occur when the swarm is operating in a random field .",
    "in particular , we have considered parameters of the distributed delay system in which there exists bi - stability ; i.e. , there co - exists both a ring state and a rotating state .    for a given noise density and delay distribution ,",
    "we have characterized the observation that a specific range of noise intensities forces a swarm from a disordered ring state , to a more ordered rotating state . by probing the effects of noise intensity along with the delay distribution width",
    ", we see a two parameter set which describes fluctuations which cause switching between disordered and ordered states .",
    "in particular , fluctuations due to sufficient noise intensities are observed to produce highly coherent and compact structures , which is clearly a non - intuitive result .",
    "we note once more that the patterns and the transitions between them , do not fundamentally change with the addition of small , local repulsive forces between particles .",
    "stronger repulsion can , however , destabilize the coherent structures .",
    "understanding these types noise - induced transitions is key to preventing coherence collapse in delay - coupled autonomous systems , as well as formulating control strategies . in particular , the idea of a critical noise threshold which can serve to facilitate transitions between different dynamic patterns is very interesting and powerful , and understanding its dependence on the structure of delay - coupled systems is an area of ongoing interest .",
    "we note that in the future , more work is required to understand the role of fluctuations on delay coupled systems . towards this end , a general theory of switching for non - gaussian noise is needed .",
    "in addition , more systematic numerical simulations will allow sufficient averaging to refine our understanding of the transitions discussed here .",
    "in addition , realistic networks of communication need to be considered beyond the globally coupled system modeled here .",
