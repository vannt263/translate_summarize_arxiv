    "1a most likely results from a larger beam size . in terms of orientations along magnetic spiral arms , the tendency that magnetic field of central ngc 1097 seems to be axisymmetric instead of bisymmetric within the circumnuclear  ring \" region may be understood from the intuitive picture of distorted unaligned magnetic - field rings for fmdws ( lou & fan 1998 ) similar to that of distorted stellar orbits for density waves ( kalnajs 1973 ) .    for ngc 1097 , the mean magnetic field @xmath26 threads through the central thin hi gas disk embedded with h@xmath78 molecular clouds ( gerin et al .",

    "the latter two estimates are only indicative , as both stellar and magnetized gas disks are involved at larger @xmath10 .",
    "our emphasis is on fmdw processes around the milr .",
    "long - trailing fmdws are excited and sustained at the milr by @xmath55 and propagate toward corotation .",
    "they are reflected by the @xmath0-barrier around corotation and travel back toward the milr in the form of short - trailing fmdws . inside corotation ,",
    "both long- and short - trailing fmdws carry _ negative _ angular momenta ( fan & lou 1999 ) .",

    "given the above parameters , @xmath97 .",
    "the @xmath0 estimate is uncertain , as the corotation region @xmath81 for two - armed spiral fmdws may involve both stellar and magnetized gas disks ; we take @xmath40 .",
    "right at the milr ( @xmath69 ) , the short wavelength is @xmath98 pc , while the long wavelength @xmath99 would be infinite ; at the reflection point of the @xmath0-barrier ( @xmath75 ) , they become equal @xmath100 pc . for a mean radial wave lengthscale of @xmath101 pc ,",
    "the damping timescale would be @xmath102 s. the timescale @xmath103 for a fmdw to go from the milr to @xmath0-barrier and back to the milr is estimated to be @xmath104 s. thus , a sizable fraction of negative angular momentum carried by long - trailing fmdws excited and sustained at the milr would have been deposited in the gas disk as a weaker short - trailing fmdw returns to the milr . as the disk angular momentum is reduced , gas materials with frozen - in magnetic flux from outside tend to accumulate just inside the milr to form a circumnuclear starburst  ring \" .",
    "an estimate of net mass inflow rate @xmath105 involves several uncertain aspects because the magnitude of excited fmdws relates to the strength of @xmath7 and the wave damping distribution depends on the effective viscosity as well as some nonlinear effects . by taking a @xmath106 and a @xmath107 in ( 4 ) , an upper limit of @xmath105 may be estimated as @xmath108 . for a stronger @xmath7 , nonlinear wave and damping effects may become important and this upper limit may be raised .",

    ", it may be possible to detect a weaker short - trailing fmdw outside the  ring \" superposed with the stronger long - trailing fmdw . if one were to regard the large magnetic - field pitch angle as a non - frozen - in steady state , which we think unlikely , then the upper limit of @xmath105 would be @xmath109 ( beck et al .",
    "the upper limit for @xmath105 induced by turbulent viscosity with a flat rotation curve is of the order of @xmath109 .",
    "some simulations also show that viscous torques are negligible with respect to gravitational torques several kpc away from the nucleus , when a relatively strong bar or tidal interaction is present ( combes 1991 ) . in terms of feeding active star formation ,",
    "the relative importance of viscous and gravitational torques around circumnuclear rings remain unresolved .    in our scenario ,",
    "the effectiveness of wave damping holds the key for different outcomes . for a weak damping ,",
    "fmdws excited at the milr eventually travel to the nucleus . for a strong wave damping ,",
    "disk angular momentum is reduced primarily _ outside _ the milr . for an intermediate wave damping , in addition to a circumnuclear  ring \" formation at the milr , remnant short - trailing fmdws also travel _ across _ the milr and be partially enhanced by the geometric converging effect ( montenegro et al .",
    "damping of these remnant short - trailing fmdws inside the  ring \" would induce a net accretion of gas and magnetic flux to fuel nucleus activities . for ngc 1097 , in addition to the starburst  ring \" ,",

    "1 ) as remnant short - trailing fmdws and suspect that the damping of these fmdws plays a key role in fueling the central smbh on sub - kpc scales .",
    "it is highly desirable that dedicated multiwavelength observations of circumnuclear regions of spiral galaxies would provide more examples to enrich the scenario advanced here .",
    "while already indicative , it is anticipated that refined maps of polarized radio - continuum emissions would ultimately establish a more specific correspondence of spiral structures of gas density and magnetic field around and within the circumnuclear starburst  ring \" , analogous to those manifest in galactic spiral structures on larger scales .",
