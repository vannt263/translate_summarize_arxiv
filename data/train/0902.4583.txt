    "there have recently been several papers on hitting probabilities for systems of stochastic partial differential equations ( spdes ) .",
    "the first seems to be @xcite , which mainly studied polarity of points for the gaussian random field which is the solution of a system of linear heat equations in spatial dimension one , driven by space  time white noise .",
    "next , the paper @xcite studied hitting probabilities for a nonlinear system of ( reduced ) wave equations in spatial dimension one and established upper and lower bounds on hitting probabilities in terms of bessel  riesz capacity .",
    "the paper @xcite considered a system of nonlinear heat equations in spatial dimension @xmath2 with additive space ",
    "time white noise and established lower and upper bounds on the probability that the solution @xmath3)$ ] hits a set @xmath4 in terms of capacity and hausdorff measure , respectively . in @xcite ,",
    "these results were extended to systems of the same heat equations , but with multiplicative noise .",
    "the paper @xcite extends these results to systems of nonlinear heat equations in spatial dimensions @xmath5 , driven by spatially homogeneous noise that is white in time .",
    "some other results on hitting probabilities for parabolic spdes with reflection are contained in the papers @xcite .",
    "the objective of this paper is to begin a similar program for systems of stochastic wave equations , starting with the analog of @xcite .",
    "we note that properties of solutions of stochastic wave equations in spatial dimensions @xmath6 are often much more difficult to obtain than their analogs for heat equations , due to the greater irregularity of the fundamental solution of the wave equation .",
    "one example of this is the study in @xcite of hlder continuity of sample paths for the @xmath7-dimensional wave equation . in @xcite ,",
    "various conditions on the density of the random vector @xmath8 were identified that imply upper and lower bounds on hitting probabilities .",
    "the conditions were expressed using a `` parabolic metric '' and were designed to be applied to the stochastic heat equation driven by space  time white noise .",
    "they were applied there first to study the linear stochastic heat equation ; the nonlinear stochastic heat equation with additive noise was then handled by appealing to girsanov s theorem . because of the absence of a suitable girsanov s theorem for heat or wave equations in spatial dimensions @xmath9 ( a problem also noted in @xcite ) , we will first develop some general results that will also be useful for nonlinear equations .",
    "in contrast with @xcite , these results are designed to be used for stochastic wave equations .",
    "we will apply them to linear wave equations in spatial dimension @xmath5 , driven by spatially homogeneous noise that is white in time . in a forthcoming work ,",
    "we intend to use these general results to study the nonlinear stochastic wave equation with additive and/or multiplicative noise .",
    "more precisely , we consider here the @xmath1-dimensional stochastic process @xmath10\\times\\mathbb{r}^k\\}$ ] which solves the system of spdes @xmath11 for @xmath120,t]\\times\\mathbb{r}^k$ ] , with initial conditions @xmath13 here , @xmath14 denotes the laplacian on @xmath15 and @xmath16 is a deterministic , invertible , @xmath17 matrix .",
    "the noise process @xmath18 is a centered ( generalized ) gaussian process whose covariance is informally given by an expression such as @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the kronecker symbol , @xmath21 is the dirac delta function at zero and @xmath22 .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath23 denote the space of infinitely differentiable functions with compact support and consider a family of centered gaussian random vectors @xmath24 , with covariance function @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 is a non - negative and non - negative definite tempered measure on @xmath28 .",
    "we note that reduces to if @xmath29 . by the bochner ",
    "schwartz theorem ( see @xcite ) , there exists a non - negative tempered measure @xmath30 on @xmath15 ( termed the _ spectral measure _ of @xmath31 ) such that @xmath32 , where @xmath33 denotes the fourier transform .",
    "elementary properties of the fourier transform show that equation can be written @xmath34 let @xmath35 be the fundamental solution of the wave equation . generically , the solution @xmath36 of is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the martingale measure derived from @xmath39 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "however , it is well known that @xmath40 is a function in dimensions @xmath41 only , so the stochastic integral in should be interpreted in the sense of @xcite .",
    "we note that , according to ( [ e2 ] ) and ( [ e20 ] ) , @xmath42 and it is well known ( see @xcite ) that @xmath43    following @xcite and @xcite , we note that when @xmath30 is not the null measure , the solution @xmath44 of is a random vector , and the right - hand side of is well defined if and only if the following hypothesis is satisfied :    @xmath45    in this case , the process @xmath36 given by is a natural example of an anisotropic gaussian process , as considered in @xcite .",
    "note that for the covariance density in ( [ e1 ] ) , condition ( [ h ] ) is satisfied when @xmath460,2\\wedge k[$ ] .    in section [ s3 ] of this paper ,",
    "we develop several results on hitting probabilities that are related to those of @xcite , but are appropriate for studying the wave equation in _ all _ spatial dimensions .",
    "indeed , the results of @xcite were tailored to the particularities of the heat equation in spatial dimension one , while our results highlight the role of the spatial dimension and are applicable to the stochastic wave equation .",
    "theorem [ t3.1 ] gives a lower bound on hitting probabilities ; proposition [ p3.1 ] and theorem [ t3.2 ] give upper bounds .",
    "these three results apply to arbitrary stochastic processes , while theorem [ t3.3 ] gives a refinement of the upper bound in the case of gaussian processes .",
    "these results are used in section [ s4 ] , but will also be useful for studying nonlinear forms of , which is the subject of work currently in progress .    in section",
    "[ s2 ] , we give simple conditions on a gaussian process @xmath47 that ensure an upper bound on the density function of @xmath48 .",
    "this is related to a result in @xcite .",
    "the upper bound is expressed in terms of the canonical metric of the gaussian process .    in section [ s4 ] ,",
    "the main effort is to obtain upper and lower bounds on the behavior of the canonical metric associated with the process @xmath36 ( proposition [ p4.2 ] ) .",
    "this is somewhat intricate for the lower bounds , mainly because the expression for @xmath49 involves integrals of trigonometric functions and these are not so easy to bound from below by positive quantities .",
    "section [ s4 ] ends by applying the results of sections [ s3 ] and [ s2 ] on hitting probabilities to obtain theorems [ t4.1 ] and [ t4.2 ] .",
    "these yield the following types of bounds :    @xmath50\\times [ -m , m]^k ) \\cap a\\neq\\varnothing\\ } \\leq c   { \\mathcal{h}}_{d-{2(k+1)}/{(2-\\beta)}}(a),\\ ] ] where cap@xmath51 and @xmath52 denote capacity and hausdorff measure , respectively ( their definitions are recalled in section [ s3 ] ) .",
    "we note that the same dimensions appear on both the left- and right - hand sides of .",
    "this conclusion could also have been deduced from theorem 7.6 in @xcite or theorem 2.1 in @xcite , which contain general results on hitting probabilities for anisotropic gaussian processes .",
    "this is because our estimates on the canonical metric of @xmath36 mentioned above , together with our lemma [ l2.1 ] , verify conditions ( c1 ) and ( c2 ) in these two references .",
    "we also note that these estimates hint at the fact that condition ( c3@xmath53 ) of @xcite should be satisfied by @xmath36 .",
    "we recall that a point @xmath54 is _ polar _ for @xmath36 if , for all @xmath55 and @xmath56 , @xmath57\\times[-m , m]^k)\\ } = 0.\\ ] ] notice , as a consequence of , that if @xmath58 , then points _ are not _",

    "it is a separate endeavor to develop , using malliavin calculus , the estimates needed for multiplicative noise , as was done in @xcite for the heat equation .",

    "our aim is to give sufficient conditions on the stochastic process @xmath67 which lead to lower and upper bounds on the hitting probabilities @xmath68 in terms of the capacity and the hausdorff measure of @xmath69 , respectively , of a certain dimension . here",
