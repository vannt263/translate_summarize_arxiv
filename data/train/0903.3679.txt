    "since the invention of optical tweezers , they have had a major impact on the way nano - sized objects can be manipulated , especially in biology  @xcite and colloidal physics  @xcite .",
    "the first realisation was shown by ashkin in 1970  @xcite where he demonstrated that spheres in a solvent of lower refractive index are subject to two forces .",
    "first , the gradient force draws particles into the centre of the laser beam due to the radial gradient in the beam intensity .",
    "second , the scattering force accelerates the particles in the direction of the beam due to radiation pressure .",
    "if the gradient force dominates the scattering force , which is achieved by tightly focusing the beam , a stable trap in three dimensions is created  @xcite , giving rise to optical tweezers  @xcite .",
    "the trap can be moved within the sample by steering the laser beam using mirrors , which are typically mounted on galvanometers .",
    "multiple - trap tweezers have been realised by splitting one beam into several traps in two or three dimensions using acousto - optic modulators  @xcite or phase holograms  @xcite . both of these techniques allow for motion of the traps , with their specific strengths and limitations  @xcite .",
    "in addition to exerting a force on particles and thereby manipulating them , tweezers can also be used to measure forces in the pico- and femtonewton range  @xcite .",
    "this paper discusses a specific implementation of optical tweezers which combines a spatial light modulator ( slm ) with galvanometer - mounted mirrors ( gmm ) .",
    "the slm can generate complex arrays of traps in three dimensions , but the trap dynamics are limited by the refresh rate of the device .",
    "the gmm can translate the trap array in a fast and continuous way , increasing the flexibility compared to an slm alone .",
    "furthermore , by combining both devices , multiple traps can be calibrated simultaneously , allowing them to be used for force measurements .",

    "the polarisation angle is rotated by a half - wave plate ( @xmath1/2 ) , necessary for the slm later in the optical path .",
    "the beam is reflected from mirror m1 ( all mirrors from thorlabs ) , then passes through a 10x beam expander be ( newport nt55 - 578 ) , which increases the beam diameter from 1.4  mm to 14  mm , the length of the longest edge of the slm .",

    "the telescope images the mirrors onto the back aperture of the objective , so that a rotation of the mirrors through an angle @xmath13 corresponds to a rotation of the beam at the aperture through an angle @xmath14 , and an in - plane translation of the trap(s ) .",
    "ideally both gmm would lie and rotate about a single point , but in practice this is not possible and they are thus slightly separated ( by 2.4  cm ) .",
    "this leads to a movement of the beam across their surfaces when they rotate and , as a result , the laser intensity through the objective varies .",

    "could be related to the lateral displacement in pixels ( 147 pixels / volt ) .",
    "no significant differences were found for different positions or directions within the field of view .",
    "the pixels were then related to absolute measures by comparison to the image of a richardson test slide , which gave a value of 68.5  nm / pixel and hence a maximum displacement of @xmath20  @xmath21 m .",
    "the gmm are controlled by a digital - to - analogue card da ( national instruments pci-6014 ) and home - written labview software .",
