    "<S> in particular , particle - number is a good quantum number , energy is conserved when the original hamiltonian is time - independent , and spatial symmetries of this hamiltonian are preserved in time for initial conditions preserving them . summarizing the above , we have obtained the tdbh model for which the wave function and the parameters of the hamiltonian ( [ deftdbhham ] ) evolve according to the variational principle . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics is determined by the coupled equations of motion ( [ tdbh_orb_eqs ] ) .    </S>",

    "<S> when the system is in the ground state and the perturbation is realized as a variation of one of the parameters in the hamiltonian , the problem is known as a quantum quench . </S>",
    "<S> quenches have recently received growing attention in the context of quantum gases in lattices @xcite . generally , the quench dynamics is studied using single - band hubbard models or simplifications thereof . here , we study a quench going beyond the bh model and would like to investigate what new physics appears . here </S>",

    "<S> this quench corresponds to a change from @xmath46 to @xmath47 . we will now study and compare the dynamics of the tdbh and the bh model . for the tdbh model </S>",
    "<S> the number of bands @xmath6 used for the expansion of each time - dependent wannier function in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ tdworbitals ] ) is increased until convergence is reached . in the present example we found that the results for @xmath48 , the one - particle density and the momentum distribution do not change visibly anymore for @xmath49 , and @xmath50 </S>",
    "<S> was used throughout for full convergence . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the spatial symmetry of the problem implies that only bands with even wannier functions , @xmath51 , contribute . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath52 remains real , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 at all times . </S>",
    "<S> all tdbh computations were carried out on a standard desktop computer and none of the computations took longer than a few hours .    </S>",
    "<S> on physical grounds it can be anticipated that the sudden increase of the ( repulsive ) interaction strength will lead to breathing oscillations of the one - particle density @xmath55 in each of the wells . however , as the final interaction strength is not very strong these density oscillations should have a small amplitude only . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that for the bh model the ratio of the interaction and the hopping parameter @xmath56 is the only relevant parameter and also that it is constant in time after the quench . in the tdbh model on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> we expect @xmath57 to vary , because the wannier functions can change in time . </S>",
    "<S> this is indeed the case . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ uandj ] shows the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath52 of the tdbh model and their ratio @xmath57 as a function of time . as expected , right after the quench the density in each well expands and hence @xmath58 decreases , while @xmath52 increases . </S>",
    "<S> both parameters then oscillate at a high frequency . </S>",
    "<S> note the short time - scale . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction broadens the density and therefore @xmath58 ( @xmath52 ) is always smaller ( larger ) than its value at time @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath52 depends on the overlap of adjacent time - dependent wannier functions , it is very sensitive to any variation of their tails . </S>",
    "<S> it varies over almost @xmath60 ! </S>",
    "<S> the interaction parameter @xmath58 is sensitive to variations of the bulk density and varies only over about @xmath61 . as a result , the ratio @xmath57 of the tdbh model varies between @xmath62 and @xmath63 , a range of about @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for the bh model the ratio @xmath47 is constant at all times as mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> the rapid oscillations of @xmath58 and @xmath52 are only possible because the wannier functions can evolve in the space of multiple bands and thus represent multi - band excitations . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly demonstrates the advantages of the tdbh model over the bh model in reproducing the physics of the quench studied here .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to the question about the nature of the quantum state after the quench and to longer time - scales . </S>",
    "<S> we first focus on the eigenvalues of the first - order reduced density matrix , the natural occupation numbers @xmath64 , which determine the degree to which the system is condensed or fragmented @xcite . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tdbh - quench-0-to-06-potential25er - natoccsm4 ] ( top ) the natural occupation numbers of the tdbh model are shown together with those of the bh model . </S>",
    "<S> for comparison also the numerically exact dynamics of the time - dependent many - body schrdinger equation is shown , obtained using the multiconfigurational time - dependent hartree for bosons method . </S>",
    "<S> for details see the literature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the time - scale is now more than a hundred times larger compared to fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ uandj ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is clearly seen that all three results display oscillations between fragmented and partially condensed states . for the first few oscillations the three results essentially coincide , which implies that for this problem the natural occupation numbers are not very sensitive to the previously discussed multi - band excitations . </S>",
    "<S> however , after a few oscillations between condensed and fragmented states the bh result deviates substantially from the exact one . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the tdbh result follows the exact one closely for many oscillations . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tdbh - quench-0-to-06-potential25er - natoccsm4 ] ( bottom ) the accumulated error of the bh model , defined as the accumulated difference @xmath65 between the largest natural occupation number of the bh model and the numerically exact result are shown , together with the analogous quantity of the tdbh model . </S>",
    "<S> the accumulated error of the tdbh model is always smaller than that of the bh model and grows more slowly , which means that also on longer time - scales the tdbh model captures the true physics much better than the bh model .    </S>",
    "<S> we will now discuss the implications of the differences of the natural occupation numbers on observables . </S>",
    "<S> the rapid density oscillations discussed earlier have a very small amplitude , and consequently hardly any dynamics is visible in real space . </S>",
    "<S> however , a substantial dynamics occurs in momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ momentaseries ] shows the one - particle momentum distribution @xmath66 of the exact , the tdbh and the bh result at @xmath59 where they all coincide , and at later times where differences have developed . </S>",
    "<S> the momentum distribution of the tdbh model is always closer to the exact one and follows it for a long time , whereas that of the bh model deviates quickly . </S>",
    "<S> here , the tdbh model allows to obtain the precise multi - band nonequilibrium dynamics essentially at the cost of a single - band model . </S>",
    "<S> of course , in order to obtain the exact result the terms that were neglected so far in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ deftdbhham ] ) have to be included into the model , e.g. , the terms responsible for correlated tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the advantages of the tdbh model over the bh model have been clearly proven .    in this work we have generalized the concept of lattice models by letting their wannier functions become time - dependent . for such lattice models equations of motion </S>",
    "<S> can be derived from the variational principle , leading to variationally optimal lattice models that can efficiently incorporate multi - band physics . </S>",
    "<S> the concept is applicable to both nonequilibrium dynamics as well as statics . in the latter case </S>",
    "<S> the ground state can be computed using imaginary time - propagation . </S>",
    "<S> the variational principle ensures that for identical initial conditions the optimal lattice model improves on the original lattice model , if the latter contains the terms of the full many - body hamiltonian relevant to the problem at hand . since the numerical effort of the optimal and standard lattice models </S>",
    "<S> are comparable , the former can also be used to assess the quality of the latter : if the respective results differ noticeably , the standard lattice model is inapplicable . as an application </S>",
    "<S> , we have presented the equations of motion for the tdbh model , i.e. , the bose - hubbard model with time - dependent wannier functions . </S>",
    "<S> we then studied a quantum quench problem in a double - well using the tdbh model . </S>",
    "<S> multi - band excitations were found that resulted in high - frequency , large amplitude oscillations of the hopping and interaction parameters . </S>",
    "<S> such phenomena are not accessible to the bh model . on a longer time - scale </S>",
    "<S> the multi - band excitations also affect the nature of the quantum state and the momentum distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we have compared the results of the tdbh and the bh model for the natural occupation numbers and the momentum distributions with numerically exact ones of the many - body schrdinger equation . for this problem </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the tdbh results follow the exact ones for a long time , while the bh results deviate quickly . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the numerical effort for solving the equations of motion of the tdbh model is essentially the same as for the bh model , see the appendix for details .    summarizing </S>",
    "<S> , standard lattice models can be greatly extended at little extra cost through the use of time - dependent wannier functions . </S>",
    "<S> it will be interesting to examine what other physical multi - band phenomena are accessible to such time - dependent lattice models , e.g. , in disordered media or in the case of the fermionic hubbard model . as a further direction we suggest to combine 1d optimal lattice models with the recently developed adaptive time - dependent density - matrix renormalization group methods @xcite to treat non - equilibrium dynamics of larger lattice systems , as is presently done utilizing standard lattice models . </S>"
