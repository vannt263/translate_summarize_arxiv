    "in this work we focus our attention on the mg@xmath0-@xmath1 relation presented by early - type galaxies ( e.g. terlevich et al .",
    "1981 ) and its possible dependence on the environment as suggested by some authors .",
    "the goal is to investigate the existence of this difference and , if real , its possible cause .",
    "we also show a comparison of early - type galaxies and spiral bulges in the mg@xmath0-@xmath1 diagram . while there is growing evidence that at least the well studied bulges ( milky way and m31 ) are old ( renzini 1999 and references therein )",
    ", it is extremely important to investigate if bulges share the same chemical properties of e+s0s .",
    "for instance , jablonka et al . ( 1996 ) and idiart et al . ( 1996 ) found that bulges ( from sas to scs ) follow the same mg@xmath0-@xmath1 relation displayed by e+s0s . in this work",
    "we address the above questions by means of an analysis of lick index measurements of integrated spectra of e+s0s and bulges which has proven to be important for studies of the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "the data will be presented elsewhere ( rit et al .",
    "2001 , wegner et al .",
    "the samples used in this analysis come from two surveys conducted by our group at observatrio nacional ( rio de janeiro ) and collaborators .",
    "early - type galaxies are primarily from the recently completed enear redshift distance survey of da costa et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , while the spirals are taken from ssrs2 sample ( da costa et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the enear project assembled spectroscopic and photometric data for early - type galaxies brighter than m@xmath3=14.5 , covering the whole sky . from these , 1223 galaxies have both spectroscopic and photometric data and were used in this analysis .",
    "spectroscopic data for these galaxies yielded radial velocities , central velocity dispersions and several indices in the lick system .",
    "photometric data in the r band yielded total magnitudes , intensity profiles , bulge and disk characteristic scales , disc - to - bulge ratios , isophotal shape parameters and a characteristic diameter d@xmath4 ( dressler et al .",
    "1987 ) . moreover , by establishing an appropriate dn-@xmath1 relation in the r band true distances were obtained for most of the objects in this sample .",
    "the enear sample was split between field and group / cluster galaxies by using the membership assignment as described in bernardi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ( hereafter b98 ) . in order to simplify the analysis we split the sample in two categories : isolated galaxies and clustered galaxies .",
    "the latter class combines groups and clusters and the two - fold separation basically represents low and high density environments .",
    "we note that as compared with the analysis of b98 there is an improvement in the group catalog used resulting in a more realistic distribution with environment namely , a larger number of clustered early - type galaxies .",
    "the sample of spirals comes from the southern sky redshift survey ( ssr2 da costa et al .",
    "1998 ) down to a limiting magnitude @xmath5 = 15.5 . here",
    "we only considered spirals earlier than sbc and galaxies with central intensity ratios bulge / disk larger than 2 . in the case of spirals , the integrated light at large radii is dominated by the disk , making an aperture correction procedure very uncertain .",
    "therefore , spectral extraction of spiral bulges was done by varying the projected aperture so as to preserve a fixed metric diameter of 1.19h@xmath6kpc .",
    "a major concern in measuring the spectral properties of bulges of spiral galaxies is the effect of contamination of the integrated spectra by disk - light .",
    "we carried out many tests to estimate the level of this contamination ( see pellegrini et al . 2001b ) and we concluded that the disk contribution in our integrated spectra is negligible .",
    "the enear database yields the mg@xmath0-@xmath1 relation displayed in figure 1a , where the data are split between isolated and clustered galaxies using the membership assignment mentioned before .",
    "in contrast with b98 ( see below ) we find a statistically significant ( even though marginal ) difference in the mg@xmath0-@xmath1 fit between the cluster and field samples ( figure 1a ) . as the sample includes both ellipticals and s0s",
    ", we also examine the possibility that morphology could be the cause of this difference . splitting the total sample into ellipticals and s0s and performing a least square fit to the mg@xmath0-@xmath1 relation ( see figure 1b ) , we find that the resulting relations are essentially the same . before interpreting the origin of this result and its and implications for the scenario of galaxy formation we need to consider further parameters that can affect the mg@xmath0-@xmath1 relation and as a consequence its interpretation as a mass - metallicity relation ( section 3.3 ) .      instead of looking for a difference in the slope of the mg@xmath0-@xmath1 relation for clustered and field galaxies ( as we did in section 3.1 ) , b98 assumed a unique slope for early - type galaxies ( obtained from the whole sample ) and looked for a zero - point difference among galaxies belonging to different environments .",
    "these authors find a zero - point difference in the mg@xmath0-@xmath1 relation between cluster and field galaxies of @xmath7mg@xmath0 = 0.007 @xmath8 0.002 . under the assumption of a fix slope",
    ", we also find a zero - point difference of 0.010 @xmath8 0.002 , in agreement with b98 .",
    "a similar result was reported by jorgensen ( 1997 ) who found @xmath7mg@xmath0 = 0.009 @xmath8 0.002 .",
    "b98 concluded that the zero - point difference of 0.007 @xmath8 0.002 found in the mg@xmath0 index would imply a difference in age of less than 1gyr , field galaxies being younger .",
    "the important implication of this result is that if early - type galaxies were assembled through mergers , this process would have had to be fast , taking place at high redshifts .      before discussing the origin of the result reported in section 3.1 , lets consider the following arguments .",
    "it is usually assumed that the correlation of mg@xmath0 with velocity dispersion is equivalent to the more fundamental one : the mass - metallicity relation ( larson 1974 ) .",
    "however , restricting ourselves to the velocity dispersion as a representation of galaxy masses , two relevant parameters are not being taken into account namely the characteristic size and the rotational velocity of the galaxies . indeed ,",
    "if a rotating galaxy is in equilibrium , the virial theorem enables us to derive its total mass , by measuring some characteristic parameters related to internal dynamics and size as shown bellow :",
    "@xmath9    where the quantities @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the effective values of the mean square line - of - sight velocity dispersion and the mean square rotation velocity , respectively , and @xmath12 is the effective radius . after some simplifying assumptions , equation ( 1 ) can be written as ( see prugniel and simien 1994 ) :    @xmath13    where k @xmath14 2@xmath1510@xmath16 if m@xmath17 is in units of solar masses , @xmath1 and v@xmath18 are in km / s and r@xmath19 in kpc . from the above expression it is clear that the mg@xmath0-@xmath1 relation represents a mass - metallicity relation only for slow rotating objects for which the approximation @xmath20 is valid .",
    "figure 1c shows this effect . in this figure , we plot all early - type galaxies from the enear database for which rotational velocity measurements are available in the literature ( hypercat database by prugniel and collaborators and rix et al .",
    "the figure also shows the different fits obtained for objects with @xmath2150km / s ( solid line ) and @xmath2250km / s ( dashed line ) . the slope difference found among fast and slow rotators is larger than the difference found when comparing different environments . in this figure ( dotted lines )",
    "an estimate of the locus occupied by galaxies with @xmath23 = 50 , 100 and 200km / s is also shown ( see pellegrini et al .",
    "these curves represent an estimate of the effects of rotation in the mg@xmath0-@xmath1 relation and the main consequence is to produce a larger scatter at lower @xmath1 value ( depending on details of the normalization adopted those dotted curves can be shifted up and down , so what is important here is their overall effect ) . as it is clearly seen from this figure , rotation moves data points to the right in the mg@xmath0-@xmath1 diagram . when splitting the objects with @xmath24 50 km",
    "/ s into clustered and field galaxies , the mg@xmath0-@xmath1 relation does not seem to depend on environment , although this result should be confirmed using a larger sample .    in summary",
    ", although we find a difference in the slope of the mg@xmath0-@xmath1 relation among clustered and field galaxies , when considering the completed enear sample , this result can not be interpreted in the framework of a mass - metallicity relation unless the effects due to rotation are taken into account .",
    "figure 2 shows the fit for early - type galaxies with @xmath26 50km / s as well as the curves obtained when including rotation superposed on the distribution of early - type galaxies ( panel a ) and spiral bulges ( panel b ) . in figure 2b",
    "the open symbols correspond to the bulges in our sample and the crosses are the data by prugniel et al .",
    "the agreement between both samples is remarkable .",
    "this figure shows that although bulges follow the same trend of increasing mg@xmath0 for increasing @xmath1 as e+s0s , a clear shift to the lower right region is seen .",
    "moreover , the slope of the mg@xmath0-@xmath1 relation for bulges is steeper than the one found in early - type galaxies .",
    "only massive bulges seem to have mg@xmath0 line strenghts comparable with e+s0 galaxies .",
    "our findings are in close agreement with the recent results reported by prugniel et al .",
    "both results are in contrast with earlier conclusions of jablonka et al .",
    "( 1996 ) based on a much smaller sample of spiral galaxies than the one considered here .",
    "the amplitude of the effect is considerably larger than the small offset to lower line strengths for the bulges noted by some authors ( e.g. wyse et al .",
    "1997 inspecting the same data ) and qualitatively similar to the results of balcells and peletier ( 1994 ) who find that bulges and ellipticals of the same luminosity do not have the same color , with bulges being bluer .",
    "part of this difference can be artificially caused in an mg@xmath0-@xmath1 plane since rotation is improperly ignored ( bulges are known to be fast rotators ) .",
    "however another reason for this difference can be related to differences in their chemical evolution and by the contamination of the bulge population by younger stars ( secular evolution and later infall ) . by analyzing preliminary results based on the iron index , @xmath27",
    ", we find that although early - type galaxies do not show a significant relation between @xmath27 and @xmath28 , bulges do show a clear correlation between those quantities ( exactly the same result found by prugniel et al .",
    "2001 ) showing that bulges and early - type galaxies show different chemical properties .",
    "in view of the above results , we suggest a possible scenario for the formation of spheroids to be tested .",
    "we suggest that the formation of early - type galaxies occurs from a gas cloud in which gravity is acting to produce its collapse and primordial angular momentum of the cloud tends to retain gas in the outer parts of the system , which can later fall back into the system .",
    "a rapid initial collapse ( involving all protogalaxy mass or a large fraction of its inner portions ) will produce a spheroid ( older stars ) and later infall of gas may contribute to contaminate such an old population by a younger one .",
    "if a galaxy resides in a low density environment , free from gas stripping , this contamination will be more efficient and those galaxies would now show a low mg@xmath0 index ( as a consequence of the addition of gas and the formation of a non - dominant younger population ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the galaxy is in a high density environment the gas in the outer parts of high rotation objects would be removed by the frequent encounters , inhibiting the infall that could cause further star formation .",
    "moreover , galaxies with low rotational velocities would have had a more efficient collapse and hence their evolution would be less dependent on the environment . to test the above scenario",
    "one would need to verify if : _",
    "i ) _ the mg@xmath0-@xmath1 relation for slow rotators is the same in field and clusters ; _ ii ) _ the mg@xmath0-@xmath1 relation for fast rotators is very different in field and clusters ; _ iii ) _ fast rotators in the field show larger h@xmath29 index values as compared with fast rotators in clusters .",
    "the observational differences concerning line strength - velocity dispersion relation of bulges and ellipticals can also be understood in this same scenario , bulges being the extreme in the sequence of increasing rotation . however in this case the differences would also be a result of different chemical evolution and later contamination by a younger population .",
    "this is likely to happen as we expect some degree of cross - talk between disks and bulges ."
