    "many different modeling techniques have been applied to these disks . however , no model has yet been able to accurately treat gravitational dynamics and collisions simultaneously in a self - consistent fashion .",

    ".    other models of dusty disks avoid treating the resonant dynamics of the grains altogether , opting instead to investigate the long - term collisional evolution of debris disks with simple geometries . analytic models of azimuthally symmetric steady - state collisional disks with a single belt of parent bodies help us develop our intuition about these systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the hybrid model of @xcite merges kinetic models with @xmath10-body models by combining a multi - annulus kinetic model which treats small dust grains with an @xmath10-body model to treat large planetesimals .",
    "however , this code is tailored for grain growth simulations and not resonant structures in debris disks ; it does not model the resonant dynamics of the dust grain population .",
    "still other models look at only the transient effects of collisions .",

    "the algorithm produces a dust distribution for each grain size that simultaneously solves the equation of motion for small dust grains , @xmath12 + \\displaystyle\\sum_i \\frac{gm_i}{|{\\bf r}_i - { \\bf r}|^3}({\\bf r}_i - { \\bf r})\\ ; , \\ ] ] and the particle number flux equation in 3d , @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the gravitational constant , @xmath15 is the stellar mass , @xmath16 is the speed of light , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the heliocentric position and velocity of the grain , @xmath19 is the ratio of radiation pressure force to gravitational force on a grain , @xmath20 is the ratio of solar wind drag to pr drag , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the mass and heliocentric position of the @xmath23 planet . the particle number density , @xmath10 , the mean flow velocity , @xmath24 , and the particle number density removed or added by collisions per unit time , @xmath25 , may be functions of position and grain size .",
    "our algorithm uses a collisionless disk simulation ( a  seed model \" ) as input to calculate initial collision rates , similar to the method developed by @xcite .",
    "however , our algorithm differs from that of @xcite in several ways .",
    "our algorithm includes poynting - robertson drag and is therefore applicable to systems with small dust grains .",
    "our algorithm also allows for the possibility that collisions can affect the dynamics of the system , and it uses an iterative scheme to find the correct density distribution for a steady - state disk . after the integration of the seed model , the algorithm",
    "can be run on a single processor in @xmath01 hour .",
    "this algorithm can generate new models that should allow us to interpret images of collision - dominated disks like those orbiting fomalhaut , vega , epsilon eridani , and hr 4796a quantitatively for the first time .",
    "we first run a seed model , a model of a steady - state collisionless debris disk .",
    "we numerically integrate equation [ equationofmotion ] for a collection of particles launched from parent bodies orbiting a star .",
    "this equation includes the dynamical effects of gravity , radiation pressure , corpuscular drag , and pr drag ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "the drag forces cause the particles to slowly lose angular momentum and spiral inward from the parent bodies from which they were launched .    during their journey inward toward the star , the particles can become temporarily trapped in the external mean motion resonances ( mmrs ) of any planets present , creating an overdense circumstellar ring structure near the planet s orbit .",
    "we use enough particles , typically on the order of a few thousand , to accurately populate the external mmrs of the planets @xcite . during the integration ,",
    "we record the barycentric coordinates of each particle at a regular interval , @xmath26 .",
    "this commonly - used technique extrapolates the results of a few thousand particles to millions of particles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "our algorithm requires the local velocity distribution to calculate the local collision rate , so we also record the barycentric velocities of each particle at the same interval , @xmath26 .",
    "we then place all of the records of the barycentric coordinates and velocities into a 3d spatial grid of bins , forming a 3d histogram that represents the distribution function for the collisionless system .",
    "b _ in figure [ velocity_distribution_figure ] shows the histogram of the particle density viewed face - on for a collisionless disk model with a resonant ring created by an earth - mass planet on a circular orbit at 1 au around the sun , using a grid bin size of 0.05 au .",
    "a _ shows the velocity records from three of these bins located in the midplane of the disk , pointed to in panel _",
    "b_.    exterior to the resonant ring structure in figure [ velocity_distribution_figure ] , the velocity distribution is approximately gaussian and the dispersion in the radial direction is approximately twice the dispersion in the azimuthal direction , as expected for a keplerian disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , within the resonant ring structure the velocity distribution is highly non - gaussian and the velocity dispersion varies greatly from one location to another .",
    "this illustration shows that to calculate the collision rates in a resonant ring we must explicitly calculate the local velocity distribution .",
    "besides the distribution function , recording the barycentric coordinates and velocities of all particles at regular intervals during the integration of the seed model yields a second important ingredient for our algorithm  a chronological record of each particle s trajectory , which we refer to as a  stream .",
    "\" we let each stream from our seed model represent a large number of particles , which varies from record to record , i.e. the @xmath23 record is scaled to @xmath27 particles . we adjust the scaling factor to control the mean collision time of the particles .",
    "we initially assume collisions only serve to remove material from a stream . as they progress through the cloud , the streams become attenuated by collisions with other streams as @xmath28 where @xmath27 is the number of particles in the @xmath23 record of a given stream and @xmath29 is the collision depth for the @xmath23 record .",
    "equation [ attenuationequation ] is analogous to the solution to the radiative transfer equation for photons passing through an absorptive medium .",
    "we approximate the collisional depth as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the velocity associated with the @xmath23 record of the given stream , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are the particle number density , collisional cross - section , and velocity of the other records in the same bin as the @xmath23 record , and @xmath32 is equal to @xmath35 divided by the bin volume .",
    "this approximation works as long as @xmath36 .",
    "we perform this calculation for all records in all particle streams , one at a time , from the first record to the last record in each stream .    after only one pass through all of the records for all streams , i.e. , one iteration ,",
    "the particle streams will be attenuated incorrectly ; the streams will be attenuated based on the density distribution of the collisionless seed model , which overestimates the particle density and therefore the collision rate . to remedy this problem ,",
    "we iterate the attenuation process of all records until no record changes by more than a set tolerance of a few percent . by doing so ,",
    "we ensure that the final number density histogram approximately satisfies equation [ numberfluxequation ] in the steady state .",

    "the disk of 120 @xmath1 grains features a ring structure caused by an earth - mass planet on a circular orbit at 1 au around a sun - like star .",
    "we applied our collisional grooming algorithm to the disk and scaled the number of particles per stream equally among all streams such that @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the mean circumstellar distance at which grains are launched .",
    "after the first iteration , shown in the top - middle panel , the collision rates are overestimated so that the surface density in the inner disk is too low . during the second iteration , shown in the top - right , the algorithm underestimates the collision rates .",
    "the algorithm alternates between over- and underestimating the collision rates while converging on the correct solution .",
    "our algorithm uses a finite grid of bins to approximate the local density and velocity structure , so poisson noise can become an issue in bins with few records . to help mitigate this poisson noise",
    ", we use a nearest - neighbor averaging routine . for bins with fewer than 10 records ,",
    "we include the records from the six nearest - neighbor bins in the calculation of @xmath42 .",
    "we weight the records in each nearest - neighbor bin at 50% of the weight of the central bin .",
    "our calculation of the collisional depth ( equation [ collisiondepthequation ] ) trivially handles seed models with multiple grain sizes .",
    "given an initial distribution of grain sizes , the algorithm can simultaneously solve for the collisional interactions among all grains of all sizes included in the seed model .",
    "the algorithm can model complex phenomena that depend on grain size , such as size - dependent collision rates , radial transport rates , and resonant structure morphologies .",
    "equation [ attenuationequation ] ignores any fragments that may be produced by collisions .",
    "treating collisions as non - productive is not valid for all collisions in all debris disks , but it is likely acceptable in a wide range of cases .",
    "@xcite argued that in the inner solar system , grain - grain collision velocities are high enough ( on the order of a few kilometers per second ) that grains fragment catastrophically during any collision , and any fragmentation products are either gas or small enough to be removed immediately by radiation pressure . in resonant ring structures , like the circumsolar ring created by earth , the collision velocities can be even higher , on the order of tens of kilometers per second ( c.f .",

    "we discuss this feature in section [ particlefragmentationsection ] .",
    "we developed a collisional disk modeling code based upon the algorithm described above .",
    "we subjected our code to a battery of tests to confirm its operation and identify its limits .",
    "here we demonstrate the algorithm s performance , show that it converges on a unique and correct solution , and place limits on the conditions under which it is valid .",
    "for now , we neglect fragmentation ; we assume non - productive collisions .",
    "below , we will refer to an analytic solution for the surface density as a function of circumstellar distance for a planet - less disk .",
    "@xcite showed that equation [ numberfluxequation ] has the following steady - state solution for an azimuthally - symmetric disk with a single grain size and grain mass under the assumption that collisions create no daughter particles : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the surface density and @xmath41 is the circumstellar distance of the dust source .",

    "figure [ binsize_test_figure ] shows these relative differences in the collision rates .",
    "the left panel shows that differences in the collision rates between the 0.05 and 0.02 au bin sizes are on the order of a few percent or less , and show no signs of structural differences .",
    "the right panel shows that using a bin size of 0.2 au results in obvious structural differences ( greater than 10% ) compared to a model with a 0.02 au bin size .",
    "the right panel also shows a subtle imprint of the grid itself , which appears as straight horizontal and vertical features in the collision rates .    in light of these results ,",
    "we recommend that the bin size for collisional calculations in a debris disk with a resonant ring structure should be @xmath51 au for a planet at 1 au .",
    "the size of structural features in a resonant ring scale linearly with planet semi - major axis , @xmath52 @xcite , so we suggest that in general , the optimal bin size for disks with resonant ring structures is @xmath53 .",
    "bins larger than this size fail to resolve the ring structure while bins smaller than this size become more susceptible to poisson noise in the distribution function .    for collision times that are short compared to the pr time ( @xmath54 ) , grains launched from circumstellar distance @xmath41 have little time to move radially inward before colliding .",
    "this process can result in a very narrow ring structure at @xmath55 .",
    "if the bin size is larger than the width of the ring , our collisional algorithm will fail to resolve the ring .",

    "we find to first order in @xmath61 that the bin size must satisfy @xmath62      if there are too few records in a given bin , poisson noise can dominate the calculation of the collisional depth , even with our nearest - neighbor averaging routine .",
    "however , we are not specifically concerned with whether a single collisional depth calculation suffers from poisson noise , but whether poisson noise affects the final outcome of the simulation . to examine the effects of poisson noise",

    "figure [ density_vs_iteration_figure ] shows that our algorithm does indeed converge , but does not indicate whether the algorithm converges on a unique solution . to test for uniqueness , we applied the collisional grooming algorithm to three independent seed simulations of disks with ring structures , using 5,000 particles for each simulation and a value of @xmath65 .",

    ", collisions happen so quickly that the disk forms a narrow ring at 10 au whose width is smaller than the bin size used in our algorithm ( 0.05 au ) ; this case does not meet the bin size criteria in equation [ binsizeequation ] .",

    "for the case of a disk with a resonant ring structure , there exists no analytic solution for the surface density with which we can compare the results of our simulations .",

    "the algorithm performs of order @xmath72 calculations , where @xmath73 is the number of records in that bin .",

    "the top - left panel of figure [ collision_rate_faceon_figure ] shows the collision rate per particle in a 0.4 au - thick cross - section through the mid - plane of a disk .",
    "the disk has a resonant ring structure caused by an earth - mass planet whose location is marked with a white dot .",
    "we scaled the disk density so that @xmath39 .",

    "the collision rate is high in a circumstellar ring near the location of the parent bodies ( @xmath03 au ) , i.e. , the birth ring .",

    "as you might expect , the top - left panel of figure [ collision_rate_faceon_figure ] shows that the collision rate reaches its highest point in the resonant ring structure , where the density is enhanced by resonant trapping and relative velocities are higher because of resonant pumping of the grains eccentricities .",
    "the average collision rate in the resonant ring structure is higher by a factor of a few when compared to the collision rate exterior to the resonant ring structure , consistent with analytic estimates @xcite .",
    "figure [ collision_rate_faceon_figure ] also shows that the collision rate exhibits azimuthal and radial structure in the resonant ring .",

    "but the region of enhanced collision rate located @xmath090@xmath48 counterclockwise from the planet does not .",
    "this second region of enhanced collision rate is primarily caused by an increase in the local velocity dispersion , as shown in figure [ velocity_distribution_figure ] .",

    "this increase in the collision rate occurs because grains that survive and spiral inward past the resonant ring structure have typically had their eccentricities pumped up by passage through the resonance , so the velocity dispersion interior to the resonant ring structure is higher than the velocity dispersion exterior to the resonant ring structure .",

    "the continuum of the collision rate is higher for semi - major axis values close to 1 au than for larger semi - major axis values because the resonant ring enhances the local collision rate by a factor of @xmath64 , as shown in figure [ collision_rate_faceon_figure ] .",

    ", from right to left .",
    "most of the first order resonances ( p+1:p ) show a split peak , with higher collision rates at the edges of the resonance than at the center .",
    "the split peaks may be caused by collisions between the grains just outside of the mmrs with the grains in the mmrs .",
    "the dashed line in the top panel of figure [ collision_rate_vs_ae_figure ] shows the classically - calculated collision rate , @xmath77 .",
    "we set @xmath78 so that the collision rates were equal at a semi - major axis of 1.5 au .",
    "this value of @xmath8 is less than the estimate @xmath9 by @xcite , and hence our collision rate is lower , likely because we simulate only a single grain size whereas @xcite consider a distribution of grain sizes and include catastrophic collisions caused by projectile grains much smaller than the target grain .",
    "our algorithm shows how the classically - calculated collision rate fails for disks with planets , since this approximation neglects collisional enhancement of particles in resonance and does not accurately approximate the average collision rate in the resonant ring structure .",
    "it also can not correctly reproduce the vertical structure of the collision rate , like that shown in the bottom - left panel of figure [ collision_rate_faceon_figure ] .",
    "the failure of this approximation is even more dramatic than these figures show because the particles spend most of their time in the mmrs .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ collision_rate_vs_ae_figure ] shows the collision rate per particle as a function of eccentricity .",
    "the particles attain an eccentricity of no more than @xmath79 when they are launched .",
    "so any particles with @xmath80 in this plot must have had their eccentricities increased by resonant pumping or close encounters with the planet .",
    "these particles have higher collision rates because they are typically located in the resonant ring , a region of higher density and larger velocity dispersion .",
    "the small peaks in the collision rate at @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 correspond to the maximum eccentricities that particles can obtain in the 5:4 , 4:3 , and 3:2 exterior mmrs @xcite , and also correspond to localized regions of higher density within the resonant ring structure .",
    "the data become noisy for @xmath84 because relatively few particles end up with such large eccentricities , except in close encounters with the planet .",

    "they also change the morphology of the resonant ring . in the collisionless case on the left ,",
    "the resonant ring structure has a sharp inner edge with well - defined azimuthal and radial structure . for the slightly collisional system ( @xmath85 ) , shown in the middle ,",
    "the density at the resonant ring s inner edge is significantly reduced relative to the rest of the ring structure .",
    "as we further increase the overall collision rate in the disk , the density of the inner edge of the resonant ring continues to drop relative to the rest of the ring , while azimuthal structures in the ring become smeared out .",
    "collisions reduce the density of the inner edge of the resonant ring for two reasons . first , as previously shown , collision rates are higher in regions of higher density .",
    "second , grains that contribute to the inner edge of the resonant ring are typically older , having had their eccentricities pumped up while in resonance .",
    "these older grains have had more time to collide with other grains .",
    "our algorithm , as described above , can handle seed models with multiple grain sizes with no modifications . with a small modification the algorithm can also model fragmentation , i.e. , collisions that produce daughter particles . here",
    "we describe a method for including particle fragmentation and present some preliminary results .",
    "when two particles collide and produce fragments , the fragments are launched into new orbits such that the fragment velocity vectors are distributed around the center of momentum velocity vector of the colliding particles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". integrating the orbits of all of these fragments would be computationally prohibitive , so we make a numerical approximation : we limit the trajectories of the fragments we model to the recorded trajectories that already exist in the seed model . to make this approximation work , our seed model must include a sufficiently wide range of initial conditions to ensure that trajectories are available that closely match the desired distribution of fragment trajectories .    to include particle fragmentation in our algorithm",
    ", we first run a seed model with several discrete particle sizes , each of which represents a range of sizes , and initially populate each size bin according to a mass distribution function ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "2 .   calculate the mass of particles removed from the @xmath23 record by collisions with the @xmath86 record , given by @xmath90 where @xmath21 is the mass of a single particle in the @xmath23 record .",
    "record the center of momentum velocity vector of the colliding particles , given by @xmath91 we assume the difference between the fragment velocities and @xmath92 is small and use @xmath92 as the desired fragment velocity .",
    "distribute the fragments by size according to a crushing law .",
    "search within the local spatial bin for streams that closely match the grain size , @xmath93 , and center of momentum velocity vector , @xmath92 , of the fragments .",
    "once the appropriate streams are found , increase the numbers of particles in those streams to account for the fragments .",
    "the subroutine described above must be executed for every pair of records in every bin . in practice , searching for an appropriate stream in which to put fragments during every interaction is computationally expensive ; the algorithm run time scales as @xmath94 instead of @xmath76 .",
    "one could imagine many possible approximations that would reduce the amount of computer time spent searching for fragment streams . for our preliminary models ,",
    "we chose to place all of the fragments from the @xmath23 record into a single mean center of momentum stream , with velocity @xmath95 we leave a detailed investigation into the accuracy and efficiency of this approximation for future work .",
    "we have implemented this particle fragmentation subroutine in our code and produced a simple model of a fragmenting disk with a resonant ring structure to illustrate the procedure at work .",
    "for our seed model , we integrated the orbits of 2,500 120 @xmath1 grains ( @xmath45 ) and 2,500 12 @xmath1 grains ( @xmath96 ) and recorded the particle positions and velocities every 426 and 42 years , respectively , as they orbited a sun - like star ( sw@xmath97 ) in the presence of an earth - mass planet on a circular orbit at 1 au .",
    "we launched the grains from parent bodies with initial conditions identical to the second seed model described in section [ seedmodelsection ] .",

    ", collisional fragmentation reduces the disk mass in large grains and transfers that mass to the small grains .    near 1.5 au",
    ", the resonant ring structure enhances the collision rates of the large grains and therefore also the disk mass in small grains .",
    "the spikes in the mass distribution function near 1 au show that the two grain sizes populate different sets of mmrs .",
    "the combined effects of collisional fragmentation and pr drag would cause the resonant ring structure , and the disk as a whole , to look different at different wavelengths , because grains of different sizes emit differently .",
