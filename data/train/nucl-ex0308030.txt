    "the circular polarization of the photon beam can be determined from the electron beam polarization and the ratio of photon and incident electron energy @xcite .    to identify the reaction channel ,",
    "the missing - mass technique was used , requiring the detection of at least two out of three final - state particles ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 ) in the clas .",
