    "frustrated spin models in one dimension have attracted attention for both the uniqueness of their characteristics and the diversity of their properties .",
    "in contrast to higher dimensional spin systems , quantum spin chains have no long range order .",
    "if there is no frustration , the properties of the chain are essentially governed by the parity of the spin : the heisenberg spin chain for instance has a gapless spectrum and algebraic correlations when the value of the spin is a half - integer whereas it has a gap and exponentially decaying correlations when the spin is an integer  @xcite .",
    "when frustration is present , the problem gets much more complex and the possibilities for the low - energy spectrum are also broadened .",
    "an illustrative example is given by the spin ladder with @xmath4 and additional diagonal couplings .",
    "depending on the strength of the frustrating couplings , the ground state of the system can be described in terms of rung singlets , short - range valence bonds  @xcite , or would eventually dimerize  @xcite .",
    "the transitions between some of these phases have been proposed to be deconfined quantum critical points which could support fractionalized spinons  @xcite .",
    "another family of problems concerns the integer spin ladders .",
    "the comprehension of integer spin chains have considerably improved since the discovery of the aklt hamiltonians  @xcite and the early work of den nijs and rommelse  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the ground state of the spin-@xmath5 heisenberg chain is now well understood : it displays a subtle hidden topological degeneracy  @xcite , associated to a non - vanishing non - local string order parameter  @xcite and supports edge states .",
    "the question of the preservation of the topological order when couplings between different chains are introduced is an open issue .",
    "it is believed that this order should be highly sensitive to perturbations . as a matter of fact",
    ", a simple coupling between two spin-@xmath5 chains leads rapidly to the destruction of the topological order  @xcite , reflecting the fragility of the edge states towards the perturbation ( see also ref .  . )",
    "however , it is also possible to maintain the topological phase by adding frustrating nearest - neighbor interactions . in this case ,",
    "a direct first - order transition between two different topological phases can be observed  @xcite .",
    "the question of the stability of the topological order in spin ladders is of crucial importance if one thinks of these systems as intermediates between @xmath6 and @xmath7 systems and regards them as a pathway to discover a spin liquid behavior in two - dimensional systems .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the presence and nature of topological phases in an asymmetric three - leg quantum spin tube with integer spin quantum numbers .",
    "the triangular spin tube has already been extensively studied in the spin-@xmath8 case .",
    "abelian bosonisation techniques  @xcite arguments suggest that the system is gapped when the tube is symmetric and maximally frustrated .",
    "it is interesting to introduce asymmetry among the coupling in each triangle .",
    "the model with the asymmetry has been studied by density - matrix - renormalization - group ( dmrg ) algorithm .",
    "recent dmrg calculations  @xcite have demonstrated that the dimer order is unstable against a small but non zero anisotropy coupling , that eventually drives the system into a critical phase .    much less is known in the case of integer spins .",
    "the triangular geometry provides a simple and natural way to introduce frustration , and we thus hope to find unconventional behaviors . here , one coupling between two legs is varied , thus controlling the strength of the frustration ( see figure [ fig : tube1 ] ) in order to explore a large phase diagram .",
    "the possibility of quantum phase transitions with deconfined spinons is also an interesting question .    besides dmrg , a group of methods that can be used to investigate this problem are the large-@xmath1 approaches . among them",
    "is the non linear sigma model ( nl@xmath0 m ) which furnishes crucial information regarding the spectrum of spin chains and ladders  @xcite .",
    "spin models with triangular geometry are described in the continuum by a @xmath9 rotation matrix field , in contrast to collinear antiferromagnets for which the nl@xmath0 m theory involves a single unit vector field  @xcite .",
    "@xmath9 nl@xmath0 m are characterized by the absence of a topological term in the action  @xcite and , in @xmath10 , by a non - trivial fixed point with an enlarged @xmath11 symmetry  @xcite . even without topological term ,",
    "integer and half - integer spin behave differently due to the occurrence of topological defects  @xcite .",
    "it remains to be seen how this scheme is perturbed by the introduction of an anisotropy in the triangular geometry .",
    "we determine the phase diagram of the anisotropic spin tube with integer spin @xmath1 by gathering together the results obtained from diverse methods : strong coupling expansion , large-@xmath1 approaches and dmrg .",
    "we find that the tube supports @xmath2 quantum phase transitions when the anisotropic coupling is varied .",
    "the nature of the transitions is debated .",
    "we begin in section [ sec : modelandlimit ] with the proper definition of the model and introduce its strong coupling limit .",
    "different phases are delimitated depending on the value of the quantum spin @xmath12 of each triangle . in section [ sec : integers ] , we develop the notion of string order parameter and we show how the spin tube model can be rewritten in terms of a local hamiltonian with a discrete @xmath13 symmetry .",
    "this hidden symmetry is broken when @xmath12 is odd and remains unbroken when @xmath12 is even . to understand the nature of the phase transition",
    ", we turn in the third part to the large-@xmath1 approaches .",
    "we begin with a spin - wave analysis to determine the low - energy modes of the model .",
    "we then derive the nl@xmath0 m and the associated renormalization group ( rg ) equations . in our derivation",
    ", we put a careful emphasis on the evaluation of the total berry phase of the tube .",
    "we find @xmath2 special values of the anisotropic coupling corresponding to a non trivial berry phase .",
    "then , we focus on the special case of the spin-@xmath5 tube with a strong coupling approach and a dmrg study .",
    "the dmrg results reveal the presence of two quantum phase transition points , in adequacy with the predictions of the strong coupling limit .",
    "the order of the transition is proposed to be first order but the numerical data also strongly suggest the proximity of the system to a tricritical point .",
    "finally , we provide a numerical phase diagram for the spin-@xmath14 tube where various even / odd @xmath12 phases compete .",
    "the anisotropic triangular spin tube is a quantum ladder problem defined by three relevant parameters ( figure [ fig : tube1 ] ) : the parallel coupling @xmath15 , the perpendicular coupling @xmath16 and the anisotropy parameter @xmath17 .",
    "the hamiltonian reads : @xmath18 with @xmath19 being the intra - chain index and @xmath20 being the rung index .",
    "the point @xmath21 corresponds to the unfrustrated open ladder while @xmath22 is also special because of its translation symmetry in the transverse direction .",
    "we start by determining the classical configurations of spins which minimize the energy of each triangle by replacing the spin operators @xmath23 with classical vectors @xmath24 .    for @xmath25",
    "the solutions that minimize the energy are of the kind of the coplanar solution of figure  [ fig : tube2 ] ( b ) .",

    "the system reduces then to the problem of one single chain . on the opposite ,",
    "decreasing @xmath31 one enters the regime @xmath32 in which the lowest energy state is an alternated collinear configuration of figure  [ fig : tube2](a ) . in this regime",
    "the physics becomes the one of an open unfrustrated ladder .    .",
    "bottom : the coplanar configuration which minimizes the energy for @xmath33 . , width=226 ]    note that the collinear state and ( [ eq : coplanar ] ) are both continuously degenerate but have a different degree of degeneracy . for @xmath34 ,",
    "any alternated collinear configuration minimizes the energy .",
    "thus , choosing a ground state is equivalent to picking up an oriented axis . for @xmath35 ,",
    "all the classical ground states are given by a global rotation of the triad @xmath36 .",
    "this , in turn , requires to choose an oriented axis and an angle .      introducing the triangle spin @xmath37 and the bond spin @xmath38 ,",
    "the rung hamiltonian reads : @xmath39 where we have replaced the spin operators by their eigenvalues . to determine the ground state , we need to label each state by their value of total spin @xmath12 and their intermediate spin @xmath40 . for @xmath41 ,",
    "the @xmath40 levels are degenerate and the ground state is obtained for the smallest value of @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the ground state is the singlet state @xmath42 ( if @xmath43 , @xmath44 necessarily ) . when turning on the anisotropy",
    ", other levels will compete with this state .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the sequence of ground states @xmath45 between @xmath46 and @xmath47 is : @xmath48 the first level crossing happens for @xmath49 .",
    "the last level crossing occurs at @xmath50 . from this last result",
    "we can conclude that both , classically and quantum mechanically , the point @xmath50 corresponds to the entrance into the unfrustrated open ladder regime given by @xmath47 . on the other side of the isotropic point , @xmath51 , the sequence of ground state",
    "is given by : @xmath52 the first crossing takes place at @xmath53 and the last one occurs at @xmath54 . after this point ,",
    "the triangle consists of two spins coupled into a singlet and an isolated spin .",
    "for instance , for @xmath3 , there is a level crossing at @xmath50 between the singlet state @xmath55 and the triplet @xmath56 and another one at @xmath57 between the singlet and the triplet @xmath58 . on figure [ fig : el ]",
    ", we plot the evolution of the main energy levels for @xmath59 .     as a function of @xmath31 as given by the two sequences ( [ eq : sequence1 ] ) and ( [ eq : sequence2 ] ) .",
    "the higher energy levels are not represented.,width=264 ]    thus , in the strong rung coupling limit @xmath60 , there are @xmath2 transition points in @xmath61 . if we now add a small longitudinal coupling @xmath62 , we can still expect that @xmath63 different phases are present .",
    "however , we need to know how to effectively make the distinction between them .",
    "as we will see in the next chapter , this can be achieved with a non local string order parameter .",
    "the nature of the phases corresponding to @xmath43 and @xmath64 are clearly different . in the former case ,",
    "the tube just consists of a trivial superposition of singlets .",
    "we will refer to this phase as the singlet phase . in the latter ,",
    "the properties of the tube are more similar to those of a single chain with @xmath65 spins , and we will refer to them as haldane - like phases .",
    "in order to characterize the different phases suggested by the strong coupling analysis , we would like to find a suitable order parameter enabling us to describe the phase transitions .",
    "usually , different phases are characterized by ( local ) order parameters , which detect spontaneous symmetry breakings . however , in some cases this standard approach does not work .",
    "this includes , in particular , the haldane phase of @xmath66 chain : it has no local order parameter but still is a distinct phase separated from a trivial phase by a quantum phase transition . in order to characterize the haldane phase , the non - local `` string order parameters ''  @xcite , one of which is",
    "@xmath67 is useful .",
    "it has been confirmed that it is non - vanishing within the haldane phase but is zero in a trivial phase ( for example the large anisotropy phase of ref .  ) .    the problem with the non - local order parameter such as eq .  , in general ,",
    "is that it is not quite clear if there is necessarily a phase transition between two states , when a non - local order parameter vanishes in one state but is non - zero in the other .",
    "kennedy and tasaki  @xcite clarified the meaning of the string order parameter  , as an order parameter measuring a spontaneous breaking of _ hidden _ discrete symmetry .",
    "namely , there exists a non - local unitary transformation which transforms the hamiltonian @xmath68 to a hamiltonian @xmath69 with short - range interaction and with a discrete @xmath70  symmetry .",
    "the @xmath70  symmetry is hidden in a non - local way in the original hamiltonian @xmath68 .",
    "the string order parameter   is transformed by the same non - local unitary transformation to the standard ferromagnetic order parameter .",
    "thus , non - vanishing string order parameter   implies a spontaneous breaking of the hidden @xmath70  symmetry .",
    "the spontaneous symmetry breaking clearly distinguishes the phases . in this sense ,",
    "the string order parameter indeed qualifies as an order parameter , despite its nonlocality .",
    "the hidden @xmath70  symmetry breaking also implies 4-fold groundstate degeneracy .",
    "this appears contradictory to the uniqueness of the groundstate in the haldane phase .",
    "however , the non - local unitary transformation only works for the open boundary condition .",
    "thus the hidden @xmath70  symmetry breaking implies 4-fold groundstate degeneracy of the original hamiltonian @xmath68 _ only in the open boundary condition_. this degeneracy actually corresponds to the existence of the edge states with spin @xmath71 at both ends .",
    "the appearance of the edge states can be understood  @xcite in the valence bond solid ( vbs ) picture where each spin @xmath5 is seen as a triplet of spins @xmath8 .",
    "spin @xmath5 at each site is first decomposed into two spin @xmath8 s .",
    "each constituent spin @xmath8 is then coupled to a spin @xmath8 in the neighboring site to form a singlet .",
    "this would give a simple dimerized state of a spin @xmath8 chain .",
    "however , projection to the triplet sector within each site gives a nontrival state for @xmath66 chain .",
    "if we consider this state on a finite chain with the open boundary condition , unpaired spin @xmath8 is left free at each end .",
    "namely , spin @xmath8 degree of freedom appears at the ends .",
    "the above construction actually gives exact groundstates for a special , solvable hamiltonian .",
    "for other models , the constructed state is of course not an exact groundstate . however , the appearance of the edge states is a common feature within the @xmath66 haldane phase . as a consequence of the edge states , the groundstates of an open chain is asymptotically 4-fold degenerate .",
    "as mentioned above , this corresponds to the spontaneous breaking of the hidden @xmath70  symmetry .",
    "thus , the hidden @xmath70  symmetry breaking characterizes the @xmath66 haldane phase , unifying the string order parameter and the edge states .",
    "however , it should be also noted that this picture is only valid in the presence of the global @xmath70  symmetry .",
    "we will , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] , discuss from the perspective of recent , more general characterization of the haldane phase@xcite .",
    "now let us move on to our problem of the spin tube with integer spin .",
    "naturally , ladders / tubes are more complicated than the single chain , and various generalizations of the string order parameter have been proposed .",
    "however , as we have discussed for the single chain , generally there is no guarantee that a non - local `` order parameter '' really qualifies as an order parameter",
    ". therefore , in this paper , we first generalize the hidden @xmath70  symmetry to the tube .",
    "then we identify the corresponding string order parameters , which detect spontaneous breaking of the hidden @xmath70  symmetry .",
    "following ref .",
    ", the kennedy - tasaki transformation generalized to the tube can be written as : @xmath72 with @xmath73 .",
    "we impose the open boundary condition on the tube ( along the leg direction ) .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the spin operators transform into : @xmath74    the natural generalization that comes to mind is to define the two string order parameters : @xmath75 applying the unitary transformation ( [ eq : transform ] ) , they reduce to the local ferromagnetic order parameters : @xmath76 for @xmath77 .",
    "now , let us consider the hamiltonian .",
    "this transforms into : @xmath78 note that the rung part is invariant under the non - local transformation .",
    "the new hamiltonian still consists of local interactions but the global continuous @xmath79 symmetry of the original hamiltonian has been hidden and only a discrete @xmath70 symmetry remains explicit : it is now only invariant under the rotation of all spins around the @xmath80 and @xmath81 axis by an angle of @xmath82 .",
    "we suggest that this `` hidden '' ( non - local ) symmetry and its associate string order parameters delineate the phases of the system . in the strong coupling limit ( @xmath62 ) , the phase diagram of the spin tube consists of @xmath63 phases , labelled by the spin index @xmath12 , analogous to the haldane state for a spin-@xmath12 chain .",
    "it has been demonstrated by one of us  @xcite that not all heisenberg spin chains , but only the ones with @xmath12 odd , do break the hidden @xmath13 symmetry and possess a non zero string order parameter . thus , as the anisotropy parameter @xmath31 is varied in the spin tube ( with @xmath83 ) , we will encounter a succession of phases with the string - order parameters ( [ eq : string - order1])-([eq : string - order2 ] ) alternatively vanishing and non vanishing .",
    "it is also interesting to consider a disorder parameter which detects _ unbroken _",
    "hidden @xmath70  symmetry , given as @xmath84 in fact , this was introduced in ref .   as a `` parity correlation function '' and shown to vanish in the haldane phase but non - vanishing in a trivial phase .",
    "here we discuss eq .   from a different viewpoint from that in ref .  .",
    "the non - local transformation   maps the non - local disorder parameter eq .   to itself : @xmath85 where we used the fact that @xmath86 because @xmath87 only takes integer values .",
    "this correlation function can be interpreted as follows .",
    "the global @xmath82-rotation of spins ( in the transformed basis ) about @xmath81 axis is a generator of the @xmath70  symmetry .",
    "let us consider a localized operation , namely @xmath82-rotation about @xmath81 axis only on the spins in the finite section between @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "this `` localized symmetry generator '' is no longer a symmetry generator of the system .",
    "we apply this operation to the groundstate , and the overlap with the groundstate is measured .",
    "the limit @xmath90 is taken afterwards .",
    "if the @xmath70  symmetry is spontaneously broken , the application of the `` localized symmetry generator '' flips the order parameter in the finite section .",
    "thus the overlap with the groundstate asymptotically vanishes in the limit @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , the disorder parameter   vanishes if the hidden @xmath70  symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "this is quite analogous to the well - known disorder parameter in the quantum transverse ising chain .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , it does not vanish generically in a trivial phase where the hidden @xmath70  symmetry is unbroken .",
    "the discussion here implies that eq .",
    "acts as a disorder parameter for the hidden @xmath70  symmetry , when the hidden @xmath70  symmetry is well - defined",
    ". it would be the case even if the inversion ( parity ) symmetry is explicitly broken in the hamiltonian , when the original argument in ref",
    ".   does not apply .",
    "( although here we discussed the case of the tube , the same argument about the disorder operator applies to integer spin chains . )      possible quantum phases of the spin tube may be characterized by the hidden @xmath70  symmetry breaking ( or non - breaking ) . as in the case of single chain ,",
    "spontaneous breaking of the hidden @xmath70  symmetry implies 4-fold degeneracy of the groundstates , but only in the open boundary conditions .",
    "this implies the existence of the edge state ( with half - integer spin , if the edge spin quantum number is well - defined . )",
    "it also implies that , we can investigate whether the hidden @xmath70  symmetry is spontaneously broken or not , by analyzing the existence of the edge states .",
    "if there are no edge states , the hidden @xmath70  symmetry can not be spontaneously broken .",
    "existence of the edge state would suggest spontaneous breaking of the hidden @xmath70  symmetry .",
    "however , it should be noted that the edge states could appear by a different mechanism unrelated to the hidden @xmath70  symmetry .",
    "the existence of the edge states can be analyzed easily in the strong - coupling limit ( @xmath62 ) . in the strong coupling limit",
    ", we can project to the groundstates of each rung , which changes according to the sequence  , as the tube anisotropy parameter @xmath31 is varied .",
    "let us first discuss the @xmath66 tube . in the isotropic regime ( @xmath62 and @xmath91 )",
    ", each triangle tends to form singlets , and we thus expect a unique ground - state ( with no boundary degeneracy ) corresponding to the phase with unbroken @xmath70 .",
    "as this phase has no spin at the boundary , it will be referred as the @xmath92 phase .",
    "on the other hand , in the anisotropic , `` unfrustrated '' regime ( @xmath62 and @xmath93 ) , the three spins of each triangle couple to form a @xmath94 spin object .",
    "the resulting physics is essentially that of the spin-1 chain and we expect a ground - state degeneracy due to the boundary spins . in the language of the transformed hamiltonian this corresponds to the broken @xmath95 phase with @xmath96 .",
    "we will call this phase the @xmath71 phase in relation with the spin @xmath8 edge state of a spin-@xmath5 chain .",
    "we can also discuss the edge states in the weak coupling limit ( @xmath97 ) with an heuristic argument .",
    "taken separately , each chain of the tube is gapped , thus we can assume that a weak interchain coupling will not change qualitatively the physics in the bulk .",
    "on the contrary , solitary edge excitations of each of the three chains are expected to be very sensitive to any perturbation .",
    "as soon as a coupling @xmath98 is introduced , they will be bounded , leaving a unique spin-@xmath8 degree of freedom at each edge .",
    "this again corresponds to the @xmath71 phase , suggesting broken @xmath70 .",
    "this picture is valid for basically any non - zero value of @xmath31 .",
    "the only special point is @xmath99 where the translation symmetry in the transverse direction leads to a bigger @xmath100 degeneracy space as it happens with three spin-@xmath8 with identical af couplings .",
    "the edge state analysis implies that the hidden @xmath70  symmetry is spontaneously broken in the @xmath66 tube , in the weak coupling limit @xmath101 for any value of @xmath31 .",
    "however , there is a subtle issue in the weak coupling limit .",
    "it can be shown that the string order parameters   and exactly vanish at the decoupling point @xmath102 . at this point ,",
    "the groundstate is given by a simple product of the groundstates of each chain .",
    "the string order parameter   can be decomposed as @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the expectation value with respect to the groundstate of chain @xmath105 .",
    "while there are @xmath106 terms , each one of them contains at least one factor of @xmath107 this is nothing but the disorder operator for the single chain , introduced in ref .   and discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : stringorder ] .",
    "it vanishes because the ground state of each chain in the haldane phase . as a consequence",
    ", the string order parameter   for the tube also vanishes , apparently implying that the hidden @xmath70  symmetry is unbroken .    on the other hand ,",
    "the disorder operator   also vanishes because it is simply a product of the disorder operators for the three chains .",
    "this rather suggests that the hidden @xmath70  symmetry is spontaneously broken , in agreement with the edge state analysis .",
    "the resolution of this apparent contradiction is as follows .",
    "the hidden @xmath70  symmetry is indeed broken spontaneously even at the decoupling point @xmath108",
    ". however , the string order parameters   and , which are transformed to the ferromagnetic order in @xmath109 by the non - local unitary transformation  , are not `` good '' order parameters to detect the symmetry breaking near the decoupling point .    in order to detect the hidden @xmath70  symmery breaking around the decoupling point , we introduce the following variation of the string order parameter : @xmath110 the nonlocal transformation   maps this order parameter to a local order parameter @xmath111 this does measure spontaneous breaking of the @xmath70  symmetry because @xmath112 is odd under the global @xmath82-rotation about @xmath80 axis .    at the decoupled point @xmath113 , eq .",
    "reduces to the product of the standard string order parameter   for the independent chains . since eq",
    "is non - vanishing in the groundstate of each chain , the `` product '' string order parameter   is also non - vanishing in the tube at the decoupling point .",
    "therefore , the hidden @xmath70  symmetry is indeed spontaneously broken even at the decoupled point @xmath102 , although the string order parameters   and can not detect the symmetry breaking .",
    "the edge spin @xmath71 in the weak coupling limit , as well as in the strong coupling limit with anisotropy @xmath93 , can be understood as a consequence of the hidden @xmath70  symmetry breaking .",
    "thus no phase transition is expected between these two regions , as both of them would belong to the hidden @xmath70  symmetry broken phase .",
    "we note that the `` product '' string order parameter   is very similar to the @xmath114 defined in eq .",

    ". however , there is a crucial difference between the two - leg @xmath66 ladder case studied in ref .   and the three - leg ladder / tube case discussed in this paper . in the present case , the `` product '' string order parameter detects spontaneous breaking of the hidden @xmath70  symmetry , thanks to the relation eq .  .",

    "<S> we investigate the properties of a three - leg quantum spin tube using several techniques such as the density matrix renormalization group method ( dmrg ) , strong coupling approaches and the non linear sigma model ( nl@xmath0 m ) . for integer @xmath1 , the model proves to exhibit a particularly rich phase diagram consisting of an ensemble of @xmath2 phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> they can be accurately identified by the behavior of a non local string order parameter associated to the breaking of a hidden symmetry in the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of these transitions are further elucidated within the different approaches . </S>",
    "<S> we carry a detailed dmrg analysis in the specific cases @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical data confirm the existence of two haldane phases with broken hidden symmetry separated by a trivial singlet state . </S>",
    "<S> the study of the gap and of the von neumann entropy suggest a first order phase transition but at the close proximity of a tricritical point separating a gapless and a first order transition line in the phase diagram of the quantum spin tube . </S>"
