    "this has worked perfectly for the kauffman state sums of the alexander and of the jones polynomials ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the present paper is a result of our search for new state sums.the new state sum takes into account not only the crossings and the arcs in the knot diagram which connect them , but also the components of its complement in the annulus .",

    "we consider @xmath52 up to isotopy which preserves this decomposition .",
    "consequently , instead of @xmath52 in @xmath10 we can equivalently study @xmath66 in the thickened torus @xmath67 ( compare e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the natural projection of @xmath54 and @xmath55 into the 2-torus @xmath68 determines a distinguished pair of generators , say @xmath69 and @xmath70 , of @xmath71 .    instead of the projection of @xmath52 into the annulus we use now the projection of @xmath66 into the 2-torus in order to define @xmath72 in exactly the same way as before besides the following two changings :    -there are no star regions , because the euler characteristic of the torus vanishes ( if there are no kauffman states for the alexander polynomial , then the invariant vanishes )    -the non contractible circles of a double state are all parallel in @xmath68 and hence represent the same homology class @xmath73 .",
    "here @xmath74 and @xmath75 are coprime integers and the homology class @xmath76 is only well defined up to sign .",
    "hence , we have to replace the variable @xmath30 by the homology class @xmath73 .",
    "contractible circles are traded to factors @xmath63 as previously .",
    "however , it turns out that @xmath72 can be refined with a new variable , which comes from an unexpected relation between the kauffman states for the alexander polynomial and those for the jones polynomial !    a dot in a double state @xmath38",
    "is called _ counting _ if the spitting at the corresponding crossing is not in the direction of the dot .",
    "each counting dot is _ nearest _ to a unique circle in the double state .    for each circle in a double state",
    "we consider all its nearest counting dots on its left side and on its right side .",
    "we show an example of a circle with exactly one nearest counting dot in fig .",
    "4 .    let @xmath77 be a circle in a double state @xmath38 .",
    "we chose its left side and its right side arbitrarily .",
    "let @xmath78 be the number of nearest counting dots on its right side and let @xmath79 be the number of nearest counting dots on its left side .",
    "the _ weight _ of the circle is then the natural number @xmath80 .",
    "we could define the weight @xmath81 in exactly the same way in our previous case of links in the solid torus .",
    "unfortunately , it turns out that each contractible circle has always the weight 1 and each non contractible circle has always the weight 0 .",
    "but in the case of the thickened torus the weight can be arbitrarily large for non contractible circles .",
    "we show an example in fig .",
    "the given double state has exactly two non contractible circles and each has the weight two .",
    "if we choose an orientation on @xmath77 then the weight @xmath82 could be defined as an integer , because the right side and left side are now defined canonically .",
    "we make the following observation ( and we left the verification to the reader ) : all non contractible circles in a double state have always the same weight and each contractible circle has the weight 1 . consequently , instead of a weighted configuration of non contractible circles all the information is already given by the following data : let @xmath77 be a non contractible circle in the double state @xmath38 .",
    "then we define    - the number of ( parallel ) non contractible circles , denoted by @xmath83    - the ( absolut value ) of its homology class ( with respect to the distinguished set of generators ) , denoted by @xmath84    - the weight of a non contractible circle , encoded by @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is a new variable .",
    "let @xmath13 be the diagram in @xmath87 represented by @xmath66 .",
    "then the _ refined _ double bracket @xmath88 is the product of the previously defined monomials over all crossings of @xmath13 and @xmath89 .",
    "( here , @xmath90 is just the notation for @xmath83 parallel curves in the given homology class ( up to sign ) @xmath84 . )",
    "the _ refined _ polynomial @xmath91 is defined as    @xmath92 .",
    "here @xmath88 is the refined double bracket .",
    "@xmath93 can be seen as a 3-variable polynomial for each fixed element in @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath93 is an isotopy invariant for those oriented links in the 3-sphere which contain a distinguished hopf link as a sublink .",
    "let @xmath52 be the link shown in fig .",
    "there is only one crossing and hence there are only eight double states .",
    "one easily calculates    @xmath94    ( we have set @xmath95 ) .    can @xmath93 detect non invertibility of @xmath52",
    "can it detect mutations which preserve the hopf link @xmath65 ?",
    "@xmath93 could be easily generalized for links in handle bodies , but it would no longer lead to an invariant for classical links .",
    "we have to check that @xmath0 is invariant under the reidemeister moves ( compare e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "notice , that the dot has to be in the newly created disc region , which can not be a star region .",
    "one easily calculates that the first two moves multiply @xmath96 by @xmath97 and the other two moves multiply it by @xmath98 and , consequently , @xmath41 is invariant .",
    "let @xmath99 be the move where the two tangencies at the autotangency point have the same orientation and let @xmath100 be the move where they have opposite orientations .",
    "let us consider @xmath99 ( the case @xmath100 as well as the mirror images of these moves are completely analogous and are left to the reader ) .",
    "we splitt the set of all kauffman states t for the alexander polynomial into four subsets shown in fig .",
    "8 up to fig",
    "we assume here that there are no stars in the regions shown in the figures . in each of the figures we consider now the four kauffman states s for the jones polynomial .",
    "the results for two of the states are shown in fig .",
    "12 and in fig . 13 ( the remaining two states lead to identical pictures besides the dot , which has slided in its region to the right , respectively downwards ) .",
    "we omit to write brackets and a dot which is not in a quadrant of a crossing means that there is a dot in the corresponding part of the region .",
    "it follows that @xmath0 is invariant under these reidemeister ii moves .",
    "this is still true if there are stars in the regions , because again there can not be a star in the newly created region bounded by the bigon . if the stars are situated as shown in fig",
    "14 then it follows that @xmath58 . but notice that in this case @xmath52 is necessarily a split link in the solid torus .      if one considers oriented diagrams then there are exactly eight different ( local ) types of reidemeister iii moves .",
    "let us call the _ positive reidemeister iii move _ those in which all three involved crossings are positive .",
    "fortunately , it turns out that in order to check that a polynomial is a knot invariant it suffices to check invariance only under the positive reidemeister iii move and under all types of reidemeister ii moves ( see e.g. section 1 in @xcite and also sections 2.3 and 2.4 in @xcite ) .    under a reidemeister iii",
    "move a triangle component of the complement of the diagram shrinks to a point and the link diagram has an ordinary triple point in the projection .",
    "there are three types of kauffman states t for the alexander polynomial at the triple point shown in fig .",
    "15 .    for each of the three types we will consider just one of the six ( respectively three ) cases .",
    "the remaining cases are always analogue and are left to the reader . in the figures we draw only the planar image of the projection because all crossings are positive .",
    "( the rest of the states t are of course identical outside of the corresponding figures . )",
    "the proof of theorem 2 is completely analogous besides the following additional consideration : we have to prove that all corresponding circles of configurations which enter into the same equation have the same weight @xmath82 .",
    "notice that the weights are completely determined by the unoriented curves together with the dots in the torus @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , it suffices to consider unoriented immersed curves in @xmath68 instead of oriented link diagrams .",
    "we consider as an example the case iiia .",
    "the other cases are analogous and we left the verification to the reader .",
    "16 leads to the configurations shown in fig . 27 .",
    "it follows again that all corresponding circles have the same weight ."
