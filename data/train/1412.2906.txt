    "microtubules ( mts ) , an essential part of the cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells , are involved in many cellular processes such as cell division @xcite , intracellular positioning processes @xcite such as positioning of the cell nucleus @xcite or chromosomes during mitosis , establishing of cell polarity @xcite , and regulation of cell length @xcite . in all of these processes ,",
    "the mt cytoskeleton has to be able to change shape and adjust the mt length distribution by polymerization and depolymerization .",
    "mt polymerization and depolymerization also plays a crucial role in the constant reorganization of the cytoskeleton of motile cells such as fibroblasts @xcite or cells growing into polar shapes such as neurons @xcite . in motile cells ,",
    "protrusion forces are often generated by the actin lamellipodium at the cell edge , but mts interact with the actin cytoskeleton and actively participate in the regulation of motility @xcite . as a result",
    ", the mt cytoskeleton shape has to adjust to changing cell shapes during locomotion .",
    "the fast spatial reorganization of mts is based on the dynamic instability : phases of elongation by polymerization are stochastically interrupted by catastrophes which initiate phases of fast depolymerization ; fast depolymerization terminates stochastically in a rescue event followed again by a polymerization phase @xcite .",
    "regulation of mt length is crucial for the mt cytoskeleton to change shape .",
    "mt length regulation by depolymerases and polymerases such as kinesin-8 or xmap215 , which directly bind to the mt , has been studied both experimentally ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) and theoretically @xcite . here",
    ", we want to explore and analyze models for cellular mt length regulation by the signaling proteins rac1 and stathmin , which do not directly associate with mts but are localized at the cell edge or in the cytosol , respectively .",
    "experiments have shown that dynamic mts participate in regulation mechanisms at the lamellipodium of protruding cells through interaction with rac1 @xcite .",
    "rac1 is a signaling molecule that controls actin dynamics and is essential for cell motility @xcite .",
    "it is a gtpase of the rho family which has been found to be active ( phosphorylated ) at the edge of protruding cells @xcite as it becomes membrane - bound in its active state @xcite .",
    "rac1 activation at the cell edge has been shown to be correlated with mt polymerization @xcite .",
    "therefore , it has been suggested that polymerizing mts play an important role in activating rac1 at the cell edge @xcite .",
    "the activation of rac1 by mts could involve their guanine - nucleotide - exchange factors .",
    "for the following , we will assume that rac1 is activated by contact of mts with the cell edge .",
    "mts are also targets of cellular regulation mechanisms , which affect their dynamic properties @xcite .",
    "the dynamic instability of mts enables various regulation mechanisms of mt dynamics . in vivo",
    ", various mt - associated proteins have been found that either stabilize or destabilize mts by direct interaction with the mt lattice , and regulate mt dynamics both spatially and temporally @xcite .",
    "mt polymerization can also be regulated by the soluble protein stathmin , which diffuses freely in the cytosol and inhibits mt polymerization @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of mt inhibition by stathmin is still under debate @xcite with the discussion focusing on two mechanisms @xcite :    1 .",
    "stathmin inhibits mt growth via sequestering of free tubulin .",
    "one mole of active ( nonphosphorylated ) stathmin binds two moles of free tubulin and thereby lowers the local tubulin concentration @xcite .",
    "consequently , the growth velocity of the mt is suppressed and the catastrophe rate increased .",
    "2 .   at high ph values",
    ", stathmin does not affect the growth velocity but only increases the mt catastrophe rate @xcite , possibly by direct interaction with the mt lattice @xcite .",
    "stathmin can be regulated by deactivation upon phosphorylation @xcite .",
    "one pathway of stathmin regulation is the rac1-pak pathway , where rac1 deactivates stathmin through the intermediate protein pak @xcite .",
    "similar to rac1 , pak has also been found to be localized in the leading edge of motile cells @xcite . because the active form of rac1 is situated at the cell edge ,",
    "this introduces a spatial gradient of stathmin phosphorylation and thereby stathmin tubulin interaction @xcite .",
    "thus , there is a positive feedback loop of mt regulation @xcite , which consists of the activation of localized rac1 by polymerizing mts at the cell edge , the inhibition of cytosolic stathmin by active rac1 via the rac1-pak pathway at the cell edge , and , finally , the inhibition of mt polymerization by stathmin , which sequesters tubulin or promotes catastrophes .",
    "the overall result is a positive feedback loop consisting of one positive ( activating ) and a doubly negative ( inhibitory ) interaction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : skizze ] , a and b ) .",
    "polymerizing mts are an essential part of this feedback loop .",
    "therefore , this feedback system represents a seemingly novel type of spatially organized biochemical network , which could give rise to new types of spatial organization @xcite . in this article",
    ", we will formulate and analyze a theoretical model for this feedback loop for tubulin - sequestering stathmin and for purely catastrophe - promoting stathmin . using this model",
    "we address the question how the feedback loop regulates the mt length .",
    "the general structure of the described positive feedback mechanism suggests two hypotheses for mt regulation , which we investigate within our model :    1 .",
    "the positive feedback increases mt growth and , thus , mt length .",
    "non - linearities in the positive feedback loop can give rise to a bistable switching between states of inhibited and increased mt growth .",
    "regarding hypothesis 1 , we will confirm that the regulation loop enhances mt growth .",
    "we will also show that polymerizing mts as one part of the loop result in a particular spatial organization of the feedback loop with _ bimodal _ mt length distributions .",
    "this allows us to successfully explain the occurrence of pioneering mts as they have been observed in waterman - storer and salmon @xcite and wittmann et al .",
    "such pioneering mts grow into the leading edge of migrating cells and exhibit a decreased catastrophe frequency .",
    "in the experiments in wittmann et al .",
    "@xcite , this pioneering behavior could be promoted by introducing constitutively active rac1 and suppressed by introducing constitutively inactive rac1 into the cells indicating that the mechanism underlying the pioneering mts involves regulation by rac1 .",
    "our model shows there is a window of stathmin concentrations , for which the mt length distribution is bimodal and consists of two subpopulations : fast growing , long `` pioneering '' mts near the cell edge ; and collapsed mts with suppressed growth rates distant from the cell edge .",
    "this bimodality is caused by a gradient in stathmin phosphorylation .",
    "regarding hypothesis 2 , we will show that our model exhibits bistability only if stathmin inhibits mt growth by tubulin sequestering .",
    "the stathmin activation gradient , which upregulates mt growth near the cell edge , represents one stable state of the switch ; complete stathmin deactivation with shorter mts the other state .",
    "if stathmin acts by promoting mt catastrophes , we do not find bistability .     and",
    "@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "rac1 proteins ( _ circles _ ) are located at the cell edge @xmath1 in active or inactive form ( _ solid _ and _ open circles _ , respectively ) .",
    "rac1 is activated with a rate @xmath2 only if the mt enters the grey shaded region ii of size @xmath3 representing the cell edge , and deactivated at all times with the rate @xmath4 .",
    "stathmin deactivation only takes place in the shaded region ii with a rate proportional to the fraction of active rac1 @xmath5 .",
    "the local concentration of active stathmin inhibits mt growth by tubulin sequestering , which reduces the mt growth velocity @xmath6 locally , or by direct catastrophe promotion . ]",
    "we formulate an effective model in which we focus on mt regulation through rac1 and stathmin ; we do not model the rac1 activation pathway through mts at the cell edge explicitly ( which requires most likely the action of additional guanine - nucleotide - exchange factors ) , and we do not model the pathway of stathmin deactivation by rac1 explicitly ( which also involves pak and , most likely , other signaling molecules ) . the following experimental facts are included : mt growth is inhibited by active stathmin ; we consider both tubulin sequestering and catastrophe promotion as inhibition mechanisms .",
    "dynamic mts activate localized rac1 upon contacting the cell edge .",
    "activated rac1 , in turn , inhibits stathmin at the cell edge .",
    "our effective model then reduces to an amplifying positive feedback loop , which is composed of one positive and two inhibitory interactions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : skizze ] b ) .",
    "we describe this regulation mechanism as a modified reaction - diffusion process that includes directed mt polymerization and approach the problem both by particle - based stochastic simulations and analytical mean - field calculations . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider one spatial dimension , i.e. , regulation in a narrow box of length @xmath7 along the @xmath8-axis of the growing mt .",
    "the model includes @xmath9 independent mts confined within the box , rac1 proteins , which are localized at the right boundary of the box representing the cell edge , and stathmin proteins , which diffuse freely along the box ( fig .",

    "now we reinclude rac into our analysis of the feedback mechanism .",

    "we studied and compared two models for the mt inhibiting effect of stathmin , tubulin sequestering and catastrophe promotion .",
    "the resulting positive feedback loop is of particular interest because of the prominent role spatial organization : mts grow along a particular direction and stathmin organization along this direction is essential .    for high concentrations of active rac1 ,",
    "our model produces a stathmin activation gradient , which leads to an increased mean mt length and bimodal mt length distributions .",
    "this explains the phenomenon of pioneering mts that have been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "we find bimodal mt length distributions both for tubulin - sequestering and for catastrophe - promoting stathmin .",
    "our model shows that the stathmin activation gradient requires a local activation of rac1 at the cell edge .",
    "local rac1 activation can happen by mt contacts for closed feedback , but an external local rac1 activation should also trigger a stathmin activation gradient and , thus , pioneering mts in accordance with experimental observations @xcite .",
    "localized activation of other kinases which inactivate stathmin could have a similar effect , whereas stathmin - targeting kinases , which are active throughout the cytoplasm , will not give rise to stathmin activation gradients or pioneering mts .    both for constitutively",
    "active and inactive rac1 we find a switchlike dependence of the mean mt length on the overall concentration ratio of stathmin to tubulin .",
    "we find such a switchlike dependence both for tubulin - sequestering and catastrophe - promoting stathmin with a characteristically steeper switch for tubulin - sequestering stathmin .",
    "this qualitative difference between tubulin - sequestering and catastrophe - promoting stathmin should be amenable to experimental testing , which might help to settle the yet - unresolved question of the mt inhibiting mechanism of stathmin .",
    "the positive feedback mechanism involving rac1 and stathmin allows to upregulate mt growth within the bounds set by constitutively active and inactive rac1 .",
    "based on our theoretical model , we predict a qualitatively different effect of the positive feedback for tubulin - sequestering and catastrophe - promoting stathmin . for tubulin - sequestering stathmin , we identify a bistable switch with two stable fixed points within a mean - field theory .",
    "one fixed point corresponds to high active rac1 , upregulated mt mean length and bimodal mt length distributions , i.e. , pioneering mts ; the other fixed point corresponds to an interrupted feedback at low active rac1 concentrations , with short mts .",
    "stochastic fluctuations can give rise to spontaneous stochastic switching events , which we also observed in simulations .",
    "interestingly , we find bistable switching behavior even in the absence of a nonlinear michaelis - menten kinetics for stathmin phosphorylation .",
    "the bistability is due to nonlinear dependencies of the mt cell - edge contact probability on the active rac1 concentration via the free tubulin concentration and the stathmin concentration . for catastrophe - promoting stathmin , this nonlinearity is absent and we find a gradual increase of mt length by the positive feedback mechanism .",
    "these qualitative differences between tubulin - sequestering and catastrophe - promoting stathmin in the theoretical model could give important indications for experiments in order to resolve the issue of the mechanism of mt growth inhibition by stathmin : experimental observations of bistability would clearly hint towards the tubulin sequestering mechanism .",
    "we checked that all of our results are robust against changes of the catastrophe model and the cell length @xmath7 ( see the supporting material ) . based on our model ,",
    "we suggest three mechanisms to influence the overall mt growth behavior or the rac1-induced upregulation of mt growth in vivo or by external perturbation in experiments :    1 .   the overall mt length can be controlled via the total tubulin or stathmin concentrations . rising the tubulin concentration or lowering the stathmin concentration upregulates mt growth .",
    "2 .   rac1 activation in the cell - edge region increases mt growth and can trigger pioneering mts .",
    "3 .   increasing the number @xmath9 of participating mts can also increase mt growth and trigger pioneering mts .",
    "all of these mechanisms should be accessible in perturbation experiments .",
    "moreover , our results on mt length distributions can be checked against future quantitative length measurements on pioneering mts .",
    "our results have implications for the polarization of the mt cytoskeleton as well . in a population of mts growing in different directions , the investigated positive feedback mechanism via rac1 and stathmin regulation can select and amplify a certain mt growth direction , such as one triggered by a locally increased rac1 concentration in the cell - edge region .",
    "this issue remains to be investigated in the future .",
