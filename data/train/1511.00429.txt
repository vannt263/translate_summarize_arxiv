    "<S> much work has been done since these pioneering results and , without ambition for completeness , we cite neas _ et al . _ who established existence of weak solutions under less restrictive assumptions ( see for example @xcite ) . + since we are dealing with fully developed flows in curved pipes , the typical issues related to the nonlinear extra stress tensor and the convective term arise and can be handled as in the case of bounded domains . </S>",
    "<S> however , additional difficulties related with extra terms ( depending on the curvature ratio ) occur and need to be managed . the splitting method , consisting in two _ coupled _ formulations respectively associated to the secondary flows and to the axial flow and used in @xcite for the study of the newtonian case , can not be applied . because of the nonlinearity of the shear stress tensor , the coercivity property of the corresponding bilinear forms in the shear - thinning case , and the monotonicity property of these forms in both shear - thinning and shear thickening cases fail to be satisfied . to overcome these difficulties </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a _ global _ formulation in an appropriate functional setting and adapt some standard tools , such as the korn inequality . </S>",

    "<S> following @xcite , we also prove that there are no secondary flows if , and only if , the dean number is equal to zero . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we consider an approximation problem ( that can be seen as a generalization of the dean s equation ) , study its solvability , establish corresponding estimates and evaluate the relationship between its solutions and those of the full governing equations . </S>",
