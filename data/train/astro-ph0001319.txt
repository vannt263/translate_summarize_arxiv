    "clusters of galaxies are x - ray bright to the extent that the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) allows sizeable , statistically complete cluster samples to be compiled @xcite .",
    "large - scale structure ( lss ) studies using clusters as tracers do not duplicate , but rather complement those using galaxies because clusters mark the locations of the deepest potential wells whereas galaxies probe primarily the low - density field . to date , most dynamical analyses of large - scale flows have been compared with the iras density fields @xcite .",
    "however , the distribution of rich clusters is significantly different from that of iras - selected galaxies @xcite as the latter are mostly spirals .",
    "there is evidence from dynamical modeling that mass congregates in clusters with much higher @xmath1 values than associated with field galaxies @xcite .",
    "historically , optical searches for clusters of galaxies , and thus also the resulting lss studies , were forced to avoid a wide band of the sky centered on the galactic plane because of severe extinction and stellar obscuration at @xmath0 . with the advent of x - ray astronomy",
    ", this restriction is greatly relaxed . rather than dust extinction and stellar confusion , it is now the x - ray absorbing equivalent hydrogen column density , @xmath2 , that is the limiting factor . as shown in figure 1",
    ", @xmath2 rises only slowly toward the galactic plane allowing an x - ray cluster survey to penetrate the plane to much lower latitude .",
    "in an attempt to overcome the limitations of existing cluster samples , we have initiated a program aimed at the construction of a statistical sample of galaxy clusters in what used to be the zone of avoidance . our survey is based on x - ray sources detected in the rass as listed in the rosat bright source catalog @xcite . in a first phase of our project which focuses on the x - ray brightest clusters we apply three selection criteria : @xmath0 , @xmath3 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 , and a spectral hardness ratio cut to discriminate against softer , non - cluster x - ray sources .",
    "cross - correlations with databases of galactic and extragalactic objects as well as follow - up observations with the university of hawaii s 2.2 m telescope have , so far , resulted in 73 spectroscopically confirmed galaxy clusters at @xmath6 ; only 15 of which were previously known ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "highlights of the survey so far include the discovery of a distant , extremely x - ray luminous cluster which acts as a gravitational lens , and , at the opposite end of the redshift scale , the discovery of a cluster at @xmath7 at @xmath8 ( i.e. , in the mid - plane of the milky way ) which is very likely part of the perseus - pegasus complex .",
