    "when the first peak began to emerge from the data , it was natural to characterize its location / amplitude / spread .",
    "this was performed by estimating the maximum in a fixed @xmath2 range , for instance by fitting a gaussian @xcite or a polynomial function @xcite .",
    "it was further motivated by the fact that @xcite showed that for the first two peaks most of the cosmological model information was contained in the peaks locations and relative heights .",
    "as more peaks became available , in particular in the high @xmath2 region thanks to interferometer - based experiments , a more complete _ phenomenological _ fit was proposed to determine the peaks locations @xcite through a sum of gaussian functions .",
    "adding an oscillatory function has also been proposed @xcite to characterize the existence of the peaks . while acceptable in the @xmath7 region ( with 5 gaussians ) it fails to describe the low @xmath2 sachs - wolfe plateau and the high part of the spectrum @xcite .",

    "obviously a modeling through cosmological parameters is not adapted to describe a purely experimental spectrum .",
    "we propose to take advantage of the expected _ smoothness _ of the @xmath6power spectrum , which comes from a combined effect of the continuity of the fourier @xmath8 spectrum in the standard model , and the use of spherical bessel functions to project it onto the @xmath2 space ( @xcite ) .",
    "this smoothness property has already been exploited for fitting the @xmath0spectrum with splines ( @xcite ) . here",
    "we will rather work in the light of the fourier decomposition in particular by revisiting the sampling theorem .",
    "this will allow to provide a very simple description of any @xmath6spectrum as a _ function _ of _ real _ @xmath2 values . therefore our goal is twofold :    1 .",

    "the sampling theorem states that for any rate ( @xmath13 ) above the critical frequency : @xmath14 the real space complete signal can be recovered through : @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the sample positions .",
    "it appears that  reasonable \" cmb power spectra are ( mostly ) band - limited to low frequencies .",
    "we illustrate that feature by choosing three representative spectra ( figure [ fig : models ] ) : one is the  _ wmap_best fit model \" ( @xmath17 of @xcite ) , a second one has different peak proportions , and a third one has shifted peak locations .",
