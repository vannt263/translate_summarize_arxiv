    "this article concerns quantum states of one - mode radiation field and their time development by using normally ordered moments @xmath2 of photon creation and annihilation operators , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . ordering of creation and annihilation operators",
    "was studied extensively in the 1960s in connection with the quasiprobability distributions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the husimi - kano function @xmath5  @xcite is closely related with the normally ordered density operator @xmath6 , namely , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath9 .",
    "similarly , the wigner @xmath10-quasidistribution  @xcite and the sudarshan - glauber @xmath11-quasidistribution  @xcite are expressed through symmetrically and antinormally ordered representations of the density operator , respectively ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the quasidistributions on phase space do not limit to @xmath12 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11-functions and are reviewed in several papers ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the recent detailed review of the phase - space approach is presented by vourdas  @xcite .",
    "an advantage of the phase - space description of quantum states is that one deals with functions ( @xmath13 ) instead of operators . as equations",
    "for quasidistributions do not involve any operator , they are sometimes easier to handle than the schrdinger or von neumann equations  @xcite . moreover , in the phase - space formalism , quantum phenomena are known to be interpreted in the classical - like manner  @xcite .",
    "being a rather good alternative to the density operator , the quasidistribution functions @xmath12 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are all equivalent in the sense that they all contain the thorough physically meaningful information about the state  @xcite . as the quasidistributions are equivalent , the question arises itself : why do not we use only one of them for all the problems ?",
    "the answer lies in actual applications of the quasidistributions .",
    "for example , using the classical interpretation of the wigner @xmath10-function in collision problems , it is possible to make some reasonable approximations and obtain an appropriate but still accurate solution to the problem without requiring excessive computer time and expense . on the other hand , the nonnegativity and smoothness of the husimi - kano @xmath12-function",
    "make it advantageous for the analysis of classically chaotic nonlinear systems  @xcite .",
    "also , the @xmath12-function of the radiation field can be measured at optical frequencies via an eight - port homodyne detection scheme ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the negativity of the sudarshan - glauber @xmath11-function is a commonly accepted criterion of the state s non - classicality , however , to observe the fact @xmath14 is not that easy ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "we can draw a conclusion that although all the quasidistribution functions are equivalent , the different functions exhibit different properties and obey different dynamical equations .",
    "those differences specify the most advantageous representation for a particular problem .",
    "the set of normally ordered moments @xmath15 can also be treated as a quasiprobability function of two nonnegative integers , i.e. @xmath16 .",
    "an interest to the ordered moments rose in the 1990s and was encouraged by the advances of measuring quantum states of light .",
    "similar to the conventional quasidistributions , the moments @xmath17 thoroughly determine the density operator @xmath18 and the explicit relation is found in the papers  @xcite . despite the moments @xmath2 are but one of plenty equivalent prescriptions to deal with quantum states ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , there is a particular problem where the moments play an indispensable role : a measurement of itinerant microwave quantum states .",
    "the matter is that at optical wavelengths there is no need to calculate the normally ordered moments and then use them to find the density operator .",
    "the output of the homodyne detection scheme is rotated quadrature distributions @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 $ ] , also referred to as optical tomogram ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and the review @xcite ) .",
    "there exists an explicit formula for reconstructing the density operator @xmath18 in terms of the optical tomogram ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the normally ordered moments are easily expressed through the measured optical tomogram as well  @xcite .    at microwave frequencies , conversely , to measure the rotated quadrature distributions @xmath19 is a challenge @xcite because of the strong thermal noise added and the absence of single - photon detectors in such spectral region .",
    "however , it has been reported recently how to extract the lower - order moments @xmath2 of microwave quantum states themselves and exclude the noise contribution to experimental data  @xcite .",
    "for details we refer the reader to the paper  @xcite .",
    "thus , in the microwave domain , the lower - order moments are experimentally determined and contain the primary information about a quantum state .",
    "given only normally ordered moments of the microwave radiation field , it is reasonable to associate a quantum state with the measurable quasiprobability function @xmath22 of two nonnegative integers and consider the time evolution @xmath23 governed by a hamiltonian @xmath24 in presence of decoherence processes .",
    "this motivates us to follow a star - product approach  @xcite and develop the particular star - product scheme on a two - dimensional lattice @xmath1 , where any operator @xmath25 is associated with a symbol @xmath26 $ ] and the product @xmath27 of two operators corresponds to a star product ( also known as twisted product ) of the corresponding symbols , i.e. @xmath28(m , n)$ ] .",
    "hence , one can associate the density operator @xmath18 of a quantum state with the normally ordered moments @xmath29 and the hamiltonian @xmath24 with its symbol @xmath30 \\equiv f_{h}(m , n)$ ] .",
    "then the unitary evolution of a quantum state can be easily written in terms of the introduced symbols as @xmath31(m , n ) , \\qquad m , n=0,1,\\ldots,\\ ] ]    where @xmath32 is the planck constant .",
    "formula ( [ unitary - evolution ] ) is nothing else but the evolution equation for the normally ordered moments .",
    "therefore , the time development of a quantum state is expressed through the measurable characteristics , which resembles the expectation value approach  @xcite and the tomographic - probability approach  @xcite to quantum mechanics . according to the latter one ,",
    "the measurable tomographic probability is a primary object to describe quantum states .",
    "the evolution equations for tomograms were found , e.g. , in @xcite .    a kernel that determines the star product @xmath33 in formula ( [ unitary - evolution ] )",
    "is not known in the literature and is expressed through factorials in . since the kernel of any star product scheme is to satisfy a nontrivial sum relation , we derive a new relation on factorials in passing .",
    "let us note that a unitary evolution of any quasidistribution function can be written in the form of eq .",
    "( [ unitary - evolution ] ) ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) but the specificity of our particular case is that the symbol @xmath34 is not determined even for the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian @xmath35 because the trace is diverging .",
    "nevertheless , in we show that the symbols @xmath36(m , n)$ ] and @xmath37(m , n)$ ] can still be determined and eq .",
    "( [ unitary - evolution ] ) takes the form of a difference equation for @xmath38 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to develop the star - product scheme of symbols given by the normally ordered moments , to explore properties of the star - product kernel , and to derive unknown evolution equations for the moments via the star - product approach .",
    "it is worth pointing out that we study the star - product scheme not of functions on the conventional phase space @xmath39 but of functions on the two - dimensional lattice @xmath1 , where @xmath40 are nonnegative integers that determine the moments @xmath17 .",
    "this peculiarity provides a nontrivial change of variables and , as we will see , yields the difference quantum basic equations in contrast to the partial differential equations for the quasidistributions @xmath5 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "the article is organized as follows .    in",
    ", we show how to treat operators as symbols defined by the normally ordered powers of creation and annihilation operators .",
    "also , we revisit the reconstruction of operators given by their symbols , i.e. the problem of moments . in , we develop the star - product formalism  @xcite of the introduced symbols .",
    "in particular , we find the star - product kernel and intertwining kernels .",
    "we calculate those kernels in the explicit form and use their particular properties to derive new sum relations involving factorials . in , we apply the developed star - product scheme to derive the time evolution of moments .",

    "( [ damped - symbols ] ) could also be derived by using a connection between the normally ordered moments and the wigner function , and then substituting these relations in the fokker - planck equation for the wigner function @xcite . however , as we can see , the star - product approach is straightforward to derive evolution equations for measurable quantities like the normally ordered moments of the creation and annihilation photon operators .",
    "although the background of our consideration is measuring radiation fields at microwaves , the developed star - product formalism can be also applied to the one - dimensional motion of particles governed by the hamiltonian @xmath142 .",
    "the main point is that the time evolution of moments remains local on the lattice if the potential energy @xmath143 can be approximated by lower - order terms of the taylor expansion ( fig .",

    "the important practical difference between a quasidistribution on the conventional phase space @xmath39 and our proposal is that the time development of a conventional quasidistribution is given in terms of the infinite - order partial differential equation which is not so easy to solve .",
    "a numerical solution of such an equation would require a construction of a two - dimensional rectangular grid in the @xmath39-plane , with the size and density of the grid being taken according to a desired accuracy ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the partial derivatives are then replaced by finite differences .",
    "the higher the order of the derivative , the more nodes of the grid are involved . dealing with the ordered moments , one does not need to introduce any artificial grid because of the lattice itself .",
    "the time development is then given by the exact difference equations in contrast to the approximate finite - difference equations for quasidistributions on the @xmath39-plane .",
    "to conclude , we present the main results of the paper .    an analysis of the star - product scheme based on the normally ordered creation and annihilation photon operators has been motivated by the recent advances in measuring ordered moments for microwave quantum states @xcite .",
    "in addition , the phase space of the constructed quantization scheme is a two - dimensional lattice @xmath1 whose nodes are given by two nonnegative integers .",
    "such a structure of the phase space is advantageous for describing the time development of some quantum systems because the exact evolution equations take the form of difference equations in contrast to the partial differential equations for conventional quasidistributions on the @xmath39-plane usually approximated by finite - difference equations on the @xmath155-grid of rather artificial size and density .",
    "moreover , it is quite reasonable to define a quantum state evolution in terms of the measurable quantities , so we have filled a gap of such equations in terms of the normally ordered moments @xmath2 .",
    "the dynamics of moments is shown to be local on the lattice for ( damped ) radiation fields and particles moving in smooth potentials .",
    "another substantial result is that the star - product kernel is found in the explicit form ( [ kernel - explicit ] ) . as any star - product kernel is to satisfy specific non - linear equalities ,",
    "we have applied one of those equalities to the obtained kernel and thus derived new sum relations involving factorials ( [ sum - rel-1])([sum - rel-4 ] ) .",
