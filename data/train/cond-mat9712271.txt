    "the prediction of nonequilibrium phase transitions in driven vortex lattices @xcite has triggered an extensive theoretical study of periodic structures moving through a random environment , using both analytical@xcite and numerical@xcite approaches .",
    "the striking experiments on vortex transport@xcite that motivated and supported theoretical efforts , provided convincing evidence for a genuine nonequilibrium phase transition between different driven states of the vortex lattice .",
    "investigations of the @xmath0 curves in nb@xmath1se samples and moge films @xcite revealed regimes of plastic and elastic flow of the vortex lattice separated by a characteristic current .",
    "neutron scattering experiments @xcite on the driven vortex state in nb@xmath1se demonstrated a sharp increase in the density of structural defects of the vortex lattice in a certain current interval just above the depinning transition . at a larger characteristic current",
    "the defect density dropped significantly , suggesting a reordering of the vortex system .    to understand the above experiments it is crucial to determine how quenched disorder affects the structure of the driven vortex system .",
    "the central idea of ref . was the suggestion that disorder , being frozen in the laboratory frame , appears as a temporarily fluctuating force in the frame of the moving vortices and leads to an increased effective temperature of the vortex system .",
    "this effective temperature strongly depends on the drift velocity .",
    "thus an equilibrium phase transition of the pure system ( like melting ) should have a counterpart in the system driven in a disordered environment and could be triggered by changing the drive at constant true temperature . for increasing drift velocities , disorder should be more and more washed out and the temperature of the dynamic transition should approach the transition temperature of the pure system from below .",
    "one related question of principal interest is to what extent disorder - induced features of the equilibrium phase diagram could be eliminated by applying a driving current .",
    "the most prominent example for such a feature is the first - order melting transition of the vortex lattice , which is experimentally found to end at a critical point.@xcite for decreasing strength of disorder the location of the transition moves to higher temperatures and the end point wanders to larger fields.@xcite therefore it seems plausible that with increasing sample purity this critical point continues to be shifted to larger fields and the theoretically expected phase diagram , which does not display a critical point , is recovered .",
    "since it is practically impossible to obtain pinning - free samples , one might hope to observe the phase diagram of the ideal pure system by increasing a driving force in a given impure sample .",
    "the discussion of this scenario is one of the goals of the present paper .",
    "already in the pure case one has to face the problem of how to capture the melting transition theoretically . here",
    "a phenomenological approach based on the lindemann criterion has been used successfully.@xcite this criterion states that the static lattice melts as the mean squared thermal displacement of a vortex line becomes equal to a certain fraction of the lattice spacing , @xmath2 . the number @xmath3 is called the lindemann number and is usually of order unity .",
    "@xmath4 is the vortex spacing in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field . in this conventional form",
    "the lindemann criterion would suggest that in two dimensions ( where @xmath5 for all finite temperatures ) crystals would always be unstable to thermal fluctuations . indeed , the long - range translational order is lost , but a quasi - long - range translational order and the topological order persist at low temperatures and vanish only above a finite melting temperature . since disorder in general reduces long - range order to quasi - long - range order between two an four dimensions,@xcite it is necessary to modify the phenomenological criterion for a detection of the more subtle loss of topological order .",
    "this is achieved by using a slightly modified criterion for the relative displacement of two neighbored vortices , @xmath6 ^ 2\\rangle } ~. \\label{def.w}\\ ] ] here @xmath7 is a basis vector of the perfect lattice that separates the undisplaced vortices . if one naively thinks of the lattice as being built by vortices connected by springs , then @xmath8 is a measure for the typical stress of a bond ( `` spring '' ) connecting neighboring vortices .",
    "such bonds can be expected to `` break '' for @xmath9 in a layered superconductor , where the vortex lines are actually composed of point - like vortices , not only the melting transition but also a decoupling transition@xcite can exist .",
    "the evaluation of bond widths @xmath8 for different orientations ( in - plane of out - of - plane ) provides additional insight into the anisotropy of vortex fluctuations and the location of these transitions .",
    "the extension of the lindemann criterion on disorder - dominated systems @xcite enabled the description of disorder - induced static transitions between elastic and plastic glasses . in view of the loss of topological order the so - called `` entanglement '' transition from the bragg glass to the vortex glass is equivalent to the melting of the pure system . using the very same lindemann criterion ( [ lindemann ] ) with bond widths averaged over thermal and disorder - induced fluctuations ,",
    "the location of this entanglement transition has been determined recently.@xcite the validity of this criterion has even been derived within a self - consistent variational approach.@xcite    for driven vortex systems disorder - induced displacements were calculated in ref . within a naive large velocity expansion approach for the two - dimensional vortex lattice , and the nonequilibrium melting line was found for the case of strong disorder . based on scaling arguments balents and",
    "fisher extended the concept of nonequilibrium phase transitions over to charge density wave systems.@xcite giamarchi and le doussal @xcite focused on the structure of the _ high velocity _ driven vortex phase and noticed that it retains some glassy features of its static counterpart .",
    "the investigations that followed @xcite revealed further fundamental features of the driven phase , in particular , the fact that in a coarse - grained description ( i.e. , on a large enough spatial scales ) the main effect of disorder on the driven periodic structure can be described as a _",
    "random force_.    most of these recent studies have been focused on the large - scale properties of the system in the elastic approximation .",
    "based on the properties of the topologically constrained system it is in principle possible to include topological defects like dislocations and to study the topological stability of the lattice systematically . in practice",
    "this approach is difficult to realize , in particular when the transition appears as collective effect of the dislocations , as in the example of three - dimensional melting .",
    "encouraged by the success of the lindemann criterion in capturing the location of the phase transition in the pure case as well as in the static disordered case , we extend this approach in this paper to the location of nonequilibrium transitions of the vortex system .",

    "we rest to discuss some specific properties of our results ( [ w_xx ] ) and ( [ w_yy ] ) for the bond widths .",

    "can be understood in a simple picture where vortices are considered as independent particles .",
    "vortices neighbored in @xmath62-direction follow the same paths and are exposed to the same pinning forces .",
    "they experience the same force , but with a delay time @xmath132 . even in the absence of vortex interactions",
    "such purely time shifted forces give rise to bond fluctuations of a finite width only .",
    "therefore the elastic interaction is irrelevant and these bond fluctuations are independent of elastic constants and decay proportional to @xmath133 .",
    "vortices neighbored in directions not parallel to velocity always move on different trajectories and are exposed to essentially uncorrelated pinning forces . in the absence of interactions",
    "their typical relative distance would increase without limits in the direction perpendicular to @xmath10 as in a diffusion process . in the lattice",
    "such a diffusive motion is prevented by the vortex interactions . since their relative distance fluctuates mainly in @xmath74-direction , which is almost parallel to their distance , it is the compression modulus rather than the shear modulus that confines the bond fluctuations .",
    "the anisotropy at large @xmath82 can be related to the anisotropy of the larkin domain in the driven lattice.@xcite this domain is much longer in the direction parallel to the velocity than in the other directions , which means that relative displacements grow faster in direction perpendicular to @xmath10 than parallel to @xmath134 .",
    "our conclusion that @xmath74-bonds are less stable than @xmath62-bonds at large velocities is in agreement with a smectic structure of the drifting system,@xcite where vortices move in decoupled chains aligned parallel to @xmath10 .    as second distinct feature of the bond fluctuations , the divergence of the bond widths at small velocities deserves some explanation",
    "this divergence , which is in general found for @xmath135 , implies that at zero velocity and for arbitrarily weak disorder all bonds are broken and the vortex lattice is destroyed , i.e. that the structure factor resembles that of a liquid .",
    "this result of the lindemann criterion coincides surprisingly with that of more elaborate methods , e.g. renormalization group methods,@xcite which evaluate the large - scale correlations of the displacement field .",
    "the divergence of the bond width in our approach arises from the integration over small momenta @xmath34 , i.e. from large scale fluctuations . from a principal point of view our perturbative treatment of disorder",
    "is not valid at largest scales , where higher order effects can no longer be neglected .",
    "therefore the correctly found divergence of the bond width has to be considered as lucky circumstance .",
    "although the phenomenological lindemann criterion is able to capture the position of a given transition , it can neither proof the existence of a transition nor can it tell us something about the nature of a transition .",
    "although in 2d a phase transition can be observed in the density of lattice defects and , as a consequence , in specific features of the transport characteristics,@xcite scaling arguments @xcite and numerical calculations of the structure factor @xcite indicate that on _ large _ length scales free defects should exist , i.e. that the topological order of the lattice is lost .",
    "however , at present a rigorous characterization of the large - scale properties and examination of the effects of defects is still missing .",
    "even if a true phase transition ( like `` solid - to - fluid '' ) related to a qualitative change of the large correlations might be absent in 2d case , we expect a transition ( like `` liquid - to - gas '' ) or at least a pronounced crossover at the location of the dynamic phase `` transition '' located by the lindemann criterion , which in its generalized form used here probes small scale correlations . while these displacement fluctuations on small scales are related to the _ rate of generation _ of ( initially bound ) dislocation pairs , large scale fluctuations of the displacement field are relevant to decide whether dislocations remain _ bound _ in pairs or dissociate into free dislocations that destroy the topological order .",
    "it is instructive to draw a comparison between the bond widths , which we examine here , and the shaking temperature @xmath136 introduced in ref . .",
    "@xmath136 was defined from the correlator of the pinning force experienced by a single particle .",
    "it is therefore independent of elastic constants .",
    "if we compare the thermal and disorder contributions to the bond width , the latter could be expressed in terms of an effective `` bond shaking temperature '' @xmath137 this bond shaking temperature differs from @xmath136 in several respects .",
    "first of all it depends on the orientation of the bonds under consideration . at large velocities @xmath136 and @xmath138 for @xmath74-bonds have the dependence @xmath90 in common .",
    "however they differ in the prefactor , which is independent of the elastic constants in the former case ( since @xmath136 characterizes a single particle ) , but contains a prefactor @xmath139 in the latter case ( since @xmath140 characterizes a relative displacement response ) .",
    "@xmath140 is more similar to the coherent shaking temperature @xmath141 of ref . , which was found to decay @xmath88 in agreement with @xmath142 for @xmath62-bonds ( and even @xmath74-bonds in an incompressible lattice ) .",
    "speaking about effective temperatures , the attribute `` shaking '' should not be taken too literally , since even for @xmath143 the bond width @xmath144 is finite and static , i.e. it has not temporal fluctuations . however , a snapshot of the displacements on small scales looks like that of a system without disorder but with a temperature increased by @xmath140 .",
    "since an effective temperature can not be defined uniquely in a nonequilibrium situation anyway , we keep in the following the notion of bond fluctuations .",
    "since these fluctuations are related to the fluctuations of the peach - koehler force acting on dislocations , we believe that the bond fluctuations are an appropriate measure for the relevance of dislocation ( at least on not too large scales , see discussion above ) .",
    "the order - of - magnitude agreement on the location of the transition between the lindemann criterion and simulation supports this picture .",
    "in a layered three - dimensional superconductor the physics is even more rich than in two dimensions : besides the melting transition , where the structural order of the vortex lattice gets lost and its elastic moduli get renormalized to zero , an additional decoupling transition , where the conductivity perpendicular to the layers becomes ohmic and the effective josephson coupling between the layers gets lost , can occur .",
    "we evaluate the bond fluctuations for layered superconductors in the driven disordered case and discuss the implications for the nonequilibrium counterpart of the equilibrium melting and decoupling transitions .    in bulk superconductors , in particular for anisotropic high - temperature superconductors , the elastic properties of the vortex lattice are somewhat intricate due to the dispersion of the elastic constants ( mainly of @xmath29 and @xmath27 ) . for completeness",

    "it is straightforward to evaluate the bond fluctuations due to thermal fluctuations and in the absence of disorder .",

    "we consider in the following moderately anisotropic systems with @xmath160 ( like for ybco , and even bscco lies just at the border ) at not too small fields ( @xmath161 ) .",
    "for such systems one finds at @xmath162 and @xmath163:@xcite    [ c44.bscco ] @xmath164    and further on    [ wth.bscco ] @xmath165    the relative strength of fluctuations of in - plane- and @xmath166-bonds is different for small and large fields . at large fields",
    "@xmath167 is field - independent , whereas @xmath168 increases without bounds , i.e. @xmath169 .",
    "thus for increasing fields @xmath170 saturates at a constant value , whereas @xmath171 vanishes . at small fields",
    "the situation is reversed : @xmath172 because @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "the bond widths provide more information than the typical displacement @xmath175 evaluated by the usual lindemann criterion .",
    "however , they are related by @xmath176 . in our lindemann criterion ( [ wth.bscco ] ) for the different types of phase transitions we use the same lindemann number @xmath3 . in principle",
    "these values might be different , since @xmath166-bonds and in - plane bonds are not not equivalent from the point of view of lattice symmetries .",
    "but a use of different lindemann numbers would lead only to a quantitative shift of the phase boundaries , which shall not be our main concern here .    in order to associate the bond widths to possible melting and decoupling transitions , it is worth recalling the main features of these transitions . since for anisotropies @xmath177",
    "the interaction between vortices in the same layer is much weaker than the interaction of vortices in different layers one might in principle expect the possibility that melting occurs as a two - step process . in a first step the positional correlations of vortices in different layers could get lost while the correlations within the layers are preserved ( at least as quasi - long - range order ) .",
    "this remaining two - dimensional order within the layers could then become short - ranged at a second transition at a higher temperature .",
    "however , this scenario is probably not realized , as one can conclude from an analogy to layered @xmath178-models . on symmetry grounds",
    "their phase diagram should be topologically equivalent to that of layered crystals .",
    "it was shown@xcite that these models have only a single transition where order is destroyed in all directions .",
    "although the relative fluctuations between the layers can become arbitrarily large for weak coupling between the layers , which is the case for layered superconductors at large fields , the transition temperature does not drop below that of the two - dimensional system . in the lindemann approach melting",
    "has therefore to be identified with the breaking of in - plane bonds .",
    "the breaking of @xmath166-bonds therefore describes a different transition , which is _ not _ related to the loss of crystalline order .",
    "two possible transitions have been considered recently : the decoupling transition and the supersolid transition .",
    "the decoupling transition of layered superconductors@xcite describes the loss of phase coherence in the superconducting order parameter between different layers and in general does not coincide with the melting transition .",
    "the location of this transition can be estimated by a lindemann - type criterion for the phase difference between neighboring layers .",
    "although the vortex displacements are the main source of such phase fluctuations , a lindemann criterion for phase differences is in general not equivalent to a lindemann criterion for vortex displacements , since a local vortex displacement leads to a nonlocal phase distortion . however , at fields below the crossover field @xmath179 , both types of lindemann criteria actually are equivalent and the decoupling transition is captured just by breaking of @xmath166-bonds.@xcite at large fields the breaking of @xmath166-bonds describes the location of the transition from a solid to a supersolid vortex crystal due to a proliferation of vacancy and interstitial lines in the vortex line crystal.@xcite      after the brief review on the effect of thermal fluctuations on bond widths and the possible interpretations of bond - breaking we now focus on our main issue , the contribution of pinning to the bond widths and the question how the above equilibrium phase diagram of the pure evolves into a nonequilibrium phase diagram of the disordered system",
    ".    only very recently the equilibrium phase diagram of the disordered system ( @xmath143 ) has received some attention ( see refs . ) .",
    "in particular the breaking of in - plane bonds has been used as indication for the transition from a topologically ordered phase ( bragg - glass ) to a topologically disordered phase ( vortex glass ) . for small magnetic fields the quantitative evaluation of the bond widths turned out to be quite a subtle issue because of the strong dispersion of the elastic constants in layered materials and the breakdown of perturbation theory in the low - field regime ( @xmath180 ) . since we are eventually interested in the dynamic effects of disorder on the dynamics , we do not attempt to reproduce the static results . however , it is worthwhile to point out that in @xmath25 the disorder induced bond fluctuations are _ finite _ for all bond types .",
    "this finiteness is found even at zero velocity and even if the bond widths are calculated from eq .",
    "( [ w.pin ] ) within naive perturbation theory that overestimates the effect of disorder . for weak enough disorder",
    "all bonds are stable and a topologically ordered phase can persist . for low temperatures the main effect of weak disorder is to reduce the long - range translational order to a quasi - long - range order .    at sufficiently large velocities the perturbative approach , eq .",
    "( [ w.pin ] ) , can always be used to calculate the shift @xmath181 of the bond breaking temperatures @xmath182 with respect to the values @xmath183 in the absence of disorder . for large velocities",
    "these temperature shifts tend to zero and the use of the lowest order perturbation theory is justified at least as long as the disorder contributions to the bond widths satisfy @xmath184 .",
    "the pinning bond widths show a complicated velocity dependence with several regimes , separated by characteristic velocities related to the different elastic constants .",
    "we focus here exclusively on the high - velocity regime @xmath185 for which we estimate the pinning contribution to the bond widths from eq .",
    "( [ w.pin ] ) :    [ w.pin.hiv ] @xmath186    where we used again @xmath187 .    from eq .",
    "( [ w.pin.hiv ] ) one can immediately draw the important conclusion that @xmath74- and @xmath166-bonds , for which @xmath144 decays like @xmath118 , are affected by disorder at large velocities much stronger than @xmath62-bonds with @xmath188 .",
    "as in @xmath24 , the relative strength of @xmath74-bond fluctuations in comparison to @xmath62-bond fluctuations is in agreement with the prediction of a smectic - like flow of the vortex lattice.@xcite    in order to extract the net field dependence of the bond widths it is important to remember the implicit dependences of the parameters .",
    "in particular @xmath189 since @xmath190 is the correlator of the pinning energy density in eq . (",
    "[ phi ] ) .",
    "for the same reason @xmath191 and also all elastic constants carry a dominant implicit field dependence @xmath192 .",
    "thus the relative fluctuations @xmath193 are essentially field independent , whereas @xmath194 increase for large fields .    to visualize the velocity dependence of the dynamic transitions it is instructive to translate the pinning bond widths ( [ w.pin.hiv ] ) of the driven vortex lattice into shifts @xmath195 of the bond - breaking temperatures ( [ wth.bscco ] ) of the pure system . from @xmath196",
    "the bond breaking temperature is reduced by @xmath197 .",
    "these shifts are    [ dt ] @xmath198    to make the net field dependence of bond widths explicit , we have introduced a dimensionless disorder strength @xmath199 by @xmath200 and the friction coefficient per line @xmath201 .",
    "furthermore we have used again the values of the elastic constants for @xmath202 and @xmath163 , where @xmath203 , and @xmath204 . in terms of these parameters the high - velocity regime is restricted by @xmath205 .    in this",
    "high velocity regime @xmath74-bonds are less stable than @xmath62-bonds over the whole field range .",
    "dynamic melting is thus always driven by the breaking of @xmath74-bonds . in the absence of disorder",
    "the @xmath166-bonds were more ( less ) stable than in - plane bonds for low ( high ) fields compared to @xmath179 .",
    "this relation is preserved in the driven case , since the bond breaking temperature of in - plane bonds is shifted more ( less ) than that of the @xmath166-bonds at low ( high ) fields .",
    "thus , the topology of the phase diagram of the driven vortex lattice remains unchanged at large velocity , as one could expect naively .",
    "the high - velocity expansion does not provide evidence for a dynamic shift of the crossover field .",
    "to discuss the actual observability of the high - velocity regime it is important to compare the above velocity range to the depairing velocity of cooper pairs . from the depairing current ( see e.g. ref . )",
    "the depairing velocity can be estimated as @xmath206 .",
    "thus even if @xmath22 is not much smaller than @xmath4 ( as required by the validity of the perturbative approach ) the high - velocity regime covers a substantial current range below the depairing current and should be experimentally accessible .",
    "as long as disorder is weak ( @xmath207 ) the location of the dynamic melting and decoupling transitions is close to the location of the equilibrium transition of the pure system , i.e. @xmath208 .    in this high - velocity regime dynamic melting",
    "is always driven by the breaking of @xmath74-bonds .",
    "the dynamic shifts of both melting and decoupling transition temperatures scale like @xmath209 .",
    "this dependence is in agreement with experiments@xcite and numerical simulations@xcite and the original concept of the shaking temperature.@xcite we have extended this original approach , which was focused on the dynamic response of a single vortex and on the response of the lattice at large scales , on the fluctuations of bonds .",
    "thereby we were able to put the characterization of the nonequilibrium transitions on a common basis with the lindemann approaches to the equilibrium counterparts .    at smaller drive",
    "the velocity dependence of the bond widths and the temperature shifts will be in general weaker than at high drive . in two dimensions",
    "the velocity dependence becomes logarithmic at small velocities and the crossover between different regimes has been calculated numerically ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_wpin ] ) . in three dimensions",
    "there are even more dynamic regimes between the asymptotic regimes of zero and large velocity because of the complex elastic properties of the vortex lattice .    however , from eq .",
    "( [ dt ] ) we can conclude that for weak disorder ( @xmath207 ) the scaling of the high - velocity regime should be observable in a considerable velocity range below depairing . in this case , where the temperature shifts are small ( @xmath210 )",
    ", it should be possible to observe a dynamic shift of the phase boundaries experimentally .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , such dynamic shifts have not been reported .",
    "we naturally expect a dynamic shift to be most pronounced in the vicinity of the critical point of the melting line since the main effect of a driving current is to reduce the effective strength of disorder and this point has been found to be quite sensitive to the strength of disorder in equilibrium .@xcite in particular the location of the critical point will be shifted to larger fields by a driving current .",
    "the anisotropy of bond fluctuations found above is consistent with the picture of smectic vortex flow@xcite due to the dominant proliferation of dislocations with burger s vectors parallel to the drift velocity , providing the actual mechanism for bond breaking .",
    "we expect the anisotropy of bond fluctuations to have immediate consequences for the structure of the coherently flowing vortex lattice . in particular",
    "even the bravais basis of the vortex lattice will display this anisotropy . in the presence of disorder the vortex system will show an expansion of its lattice constants similar to a thermal expansion . from the anisotropy of the bond fluctuations one has to expect that this expansion will be larger in @xmath74-direction than in @xmath62-direction .",
    "it would be interesting to analyze neutron scattering and bitter decoration experiments on the driven vortex lattice in view of a dynamic shift of the location of the ( quasi)-bragg peaks .",
