    "pion photoproduction was extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally in the sixties and seventies .",
    "the basic theoretical approach was given by dispersion theory , especially by fixed @xmath0 dispersion relations . since perturbative methods of quantum field theory",
    "fail in the case of the strong interactions in the resonance region , dispersion relations seemed to be the only possible tool to treat hadronic processes on a quantitative level . given the technical possibilities of that time , the statistics of the data was moderate and systematical errors were large . with the development of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) as a fundamental field theory in terms of quarks and gluons , the theoretical understanding of strong interactions has improved at the higher energies .",
    "however our understanding of hadron physics in the nonperturbative region at energies of the order of 1 gev remains still unsatisfactory .",
    "although quark models of different kinds give some description of the baryon and meson spectra , their predictive power for reactions is still quite poor . the only approach to infer all the symmetries of qcd into the physics at these energies",
    "is given by chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) .",
    "however , the results of chpt can be applied only in the threshold region .",
    "recently , it has been investigated how to include the most prominent resonance of the nucleon , the @xmath10(1232 ) , within the framework of heavy baryon chpt .",
    "however , the first results achieved by this technique are not yet satisfactory . on the other side modern electron accelerators",
    "have provided a host of high precision data in the 90 s , and will continue to do so .",
    "beams of high current and high duty factor together with considerably improved particle detection techniques have reduced the statistical errors to the order of a few percent , and promise to keep control of the systematical errors at the same level . to interpret these data with respect to the most interesting features ,",
    "i.e. the threshold behaviour and the electromagnetic excitation of resonances , a partial wave analysis is mandatory . to ensure the consistency and uniqueness of such an analysis",
    ", constraints from unitarity and dispersion relations have to be imposed .",
    "such concepts have proven to be quite successful in pion - nucleon scattering @xcite . in comparison with that field ,",
    "the situation in pion photoproduction is considerably more complex .",
    "the spin and isospin structure leads to twelve independent amplitudes , while in pion - nucleon scattering there are only four such amplitudes . as a consequence",
    "a complete experiment @xcite requires the use of many polarization observables .",
    "such a complete experiment has not yet been performed .",
    "however , the new experiments provide an ever increasing amount of precise and new data . at present",
    ", the experimental thrust is mainly on measurements near threshold and around the @xmath10(1232 ) resonance . in the coming years",
    ", a series of experiments at jefferson lab will cover the whole resonance region .",
    "restricting our theoretical investigations to the threshold region and the low - lying resonances , we are lead to choose the method of omns and muskhelishvili to analyse the existing data , because it introduces a natural parametrization and fulfills the constraints of unitarity at the same trace .    in the future , the required shift to include also higher energies will make it necessary to take account of the full content of dispersion methods and to apply more involved techniques . at the moment , however , we obtain an excellent representation of the analysed data by use of the method of ref .",
    ". therefore we deem it worthwhile extending this method to the second resonance region as a next step .    in sec .",
    "2 of this contribution we briefly recall the kinematics , amplitudes and ( polarization ) observables of pion photoproduction .",
    "the essential ingredients of dispersion relations at fixed @xmath0 are outlined in sec .",
    "the method of omns and muskhelishvili to solve these coupled integral equations is given in sec .",
    "in particular , we also discuss our choice of the free parameters of that method , which are then fitted to our data basis ( sec .  5 ) .",
    "this fit defines the result for the multipole amplitudes , which are presented in sec .",
    "in particular we give our prediction for the threshold production of charged and neutral pions , the ratio of electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole radiation in the region of the @xmath10(1232 ) , and the inclusive cross sections .",
