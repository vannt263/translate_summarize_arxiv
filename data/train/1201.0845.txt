    "in conventional magnets with magnetic long - range order , dynamical properties are explained in terms of magnons in spin - wave theory @xcite . in a magnetic field , the dispersion relation of the magnon deforms according to the change of the ground - state spin configuration @xcite .",
    "however , for systems without magnetic long - range order , the spin - wave theory based on classical spin configurations is not justified , and the dynamical properties are not necessarily explained in terms of the magnon .",
    "in fact , in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain , whose ground state has no magnetic long - range order , the dynamical properties in zero field are explained in terms of spinons @xcite .",
    "also , in spatially anisotropic two - dimensional ( 2d ) frustrated heisenberg antiferromagnets , bound states of spinons , called triplons , dominate the spectra in zero field @xcite .",
    "although the triplon might appear similar to the magnon , its stabilization mechanism differs from that of the magnon : the triplon is induced by spin exchange , i.e. , two - spinon hopping , between neighboring chains @xcite , while the magnon is stabilized by the classical spin configuration @xcite .",
    "the difference between such quasiparticles ( qp s ) without ordered ground states and the magnon created from magnetic long - range order becomes clearer in a magnetic field .",
    "for example , in an antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain in a magnetic field , low - energy properties are primarily explained in terms of qp s called psinons ( @xmath0 s ) and anti - psinons ( @xmath1 s ) @xcite , which have gapless points at incommensurate momenta different from those of the magnon , in addition to the gapless points at commensurate momenta . in anisotropic-2d",
    "frustrated heisenberg antiferromagnets , bound states of @xmath0 s and @xmath1 s dominate the low - energy spectra , leading to incommensurate magnetic long - range order whose momentum shifts significantly with the magnetic field and multi - particle crossover in a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "these features can not be explained in terms of the magnon in linear spin - wave theory .",
    "furthermore , in an antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain , a continuum is separated from other low - energy continua in a magnetic field , and shifts to higher energies as the magnetic field increases @xcite .",
    "in fact , signatures of the high - energy continuum have been observed in inelastic neutron scattering experiments on the 1d heisenberg antiferromagnet cucl@xmath22n(c@xmath3d@xmath3 ) in a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this high - energy continuum can not be explained in terms of either magnons in linear spin - wave theory or @xmath0 s and @xmath1 s . by using the bethe ansatz @xcite ,",
    "the continuum has been identified @xcite as that of 2-string solutions @xcite , and a qp representing the 2-string has been introduced @xcite .",
    "such a high - energy feature is not special to 1d chains , but is also relevant to frustrated antiferromagnets in higher dimensions . in anisotropic-2d",
    "frustrated heisenberg antiferromagnets , a high - energy mode , which can be regarded as bound states of @xmath0 and the qp for the 2-string , emerges from the continuum of 1d chains @xcite . indeed , signatures of the high - energy mode have been observed in inelastic neutron scattering experiments on the anisotropic triangular heisenberg antiferromagnet cs@xmath4cucl@xmath5 in a magnetic field @xcite . for intuitive understanding of the nature of such high - energy states",
    ", it would be helpful to indicate relations to well - known features in other systems . in this paper",
    ", we argue that the high - energy continuum of antiferromagnetic heisenberg chains and the high - energy mode of frustrated heisenberg antiferromagnets in a magnetic field are caused by the mechanism similar to that of the upper hubbard band in the hubbard model , by using the bethe ansatz .",
    "the hubbard model is defined by the following hamiltonian : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote annihilation and number operators of an electron with spin @xmath9 at site @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "here , @xmath11 means that @xmath10 and @xmath12 are nearest neighbors . in the repulsive ( @xmath13 ) hubbard model ,",
    "the ground state at half - filling becomes insulating when the on - site coulomb repulsion is strong enough , because addition of an electron to the ground state costs energy of order @xmath14 .",
    "this implies that the band splits into two bands , called hubbard bands , by the repulsive interaction .",
    "one might naively think that double occupancy would characterize the upper hubbard band and that it may be regarded as a qp , doublon . here , we show that this naive picture is not accurate , by using the 1d hubbard model . in the bethe ansatz ,",
    "exact solutions of the 1d hubbard model are parameterized by quasimomenta @xmath15 and rapidities @xmath16 that satisfy the following bethe equations @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 denote the number of sites , electrons , and down spins , respectively . here , @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    "are called bethe quantum numbers , which are integers or half - odd integers constrained by @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 under the ( anti-)periodic boundary condition . the energy and momentum of an eigenstate",
    "are expressed as @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "since @xmath15 and @xmath16 are obtained through the above bethe equations once @xmath25 and @xmath26 are given , eigenstates are characterized by @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "essential spectral features in the lower hubbard band have been well explained in terms of qp s defined by the distributions of @xmath25 and @xmath26 for real @xmath15 and real @xmath16 solutions @xcite . here , the qp s defined by @xmath25 are called holons and anti - holons , and those defined by @xmath26 are called spinons . in the lower hubbard band , there are also continua of 2-@xmath27-string solutions @xcite , for which the qp representing the 2-@xmath27-string @xcite is relevant .",
    "however , for the upper hubbard band , we need to consider other solutions .",
    "it is known that there are solutions with complex @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "recently , single - particle properties in the upper hubbard band have been explained by using @xmath28-@xmath27 string solutions @xcite where the @xmath28-@xmath27 string is a pair of quasimomenta @xmath29 and @xmath30 complex conjugate to each other , i.e. , @xmath31 with real @xmath32 within the accuracy of @xmath33 with @xmath34 @xcite . in the @xmath28-@xmath27",

    "this doublon characterizes the upper hubbard band : while properties in the lower hubbard band are explained by using solutions without @xmath28-@xmath27 strings , those in the upper hubbard band are explained by using solutions with the @xmath28-@xmath27 string ( fig .",
    "[ fig](c ) ) @xcite .",
    "also , it should be noted that the number of the doublons is an integer in each eigenstate .",
    "these features contrast with conventional doublons defined as double occupancies .",
    "namely , the number of double occupancies is not an integer in eigenstates , and double occupancy exists even in the ground state at half - filling , i.e. , in the lower hubbard band , which implies that double occupancies do not behave as qp s for the upper hubbard band . in terms of the doublon defined as the @xmath28-@xmath27 string",
    ", the upper hubbard band can be well distinguished from the lower hubbard band by the presence of the doublon ( @xmath28-@xmath27 string ) in eigenstates .",
    "or , we can define the upper and lower hubbard bands as eigenstates with and without the doublon , respectively . from the above argument",
    ", we can readily conclude that properties in the lower hubbard band have no relation to the doublon .",
    "for example , pseudo - gap behaviors in the lower hubbard band can be essentially explained in terms of spinon , holons , and anti - holons without the doublon @xcite , which contrasts with the picture of doublon ( double occupancy)-holon ( empty site ) binding for pseudo - gap behaviors near the mott transition proposed in the literature @xcite .",

    "the continuum of 2-string solutions shifts to higher energies as the magnetic field increases @xcite , as the upper hubbard band does with hole doping @xcite .",
    "likewise , a corresponding continuum appears in the spinless fermion model with nearest neighbor repulsion on a 1d lattice @xcite , since the hard - core boson model can be mapped to the spinless fermion model through the jordan - wigner transformation .",
    "in anisotropic-2d frustrated heisenberg antiferromagnets , interchain spin exchange induces bound states of 1d qp s from continua of 1d chains @xcite .",
    "the mechanism can be intuitively understood by noting that spin exchange corresponds to two - spinon hopping in zero field @xcite : the kinetic energy in the direction perpendicular to chains gains by forming bound states of spinons due to the pair hopping of spinons , i.e. , spin exchange , between neighboring chains .",
