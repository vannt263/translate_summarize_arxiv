    "supernovae ( sne ) resulting from the deaths of massive stars span a wide range of peak absolute visual magnitude , typically between @xmath015 and @xmath020.5 , and usually reaching their peak within about 20  d. they also exhibit a range of spectral properties depending on the extent to which products of nuclear burning are exposed at their surface , as well as the expansion speed and the amount of circumstellar material .",
    "their diversity depends on the star s initial mass and rate of mass loss during its lifetime .",
    "current expectations are that stars born with initial masses above @xmath440  m@xmath5 , which never become red supergiants ( rsgs ; humphreys & davidson 1979 ) , will shed their hydrogen envelopes to expose their he core before they die ( e.g. , abbott & conti 1987 ) . as wolf - rayet",
    "( wr ) stars , they are then expected to explode , producing type ib / c sne ( see filippenko 1997 ) . based on observations of sn  2006gy that we discuss here , we speculate that this scenario does not always apply .    one way to prevent a star from reaching the wr phase before explosion would be if the star s mass - loss rate is insufficient to shed the hydrogen envelope before the end of core he burning .",
    "this is thought to be the case for massive stars in the early universe , because their much lower ( or zero ) metallicity should make their line - driven stellar winds very inefficient ( baraffe et al .",
    "2001 ; kudritzki 2002 ; heger et al .",
    "depending on the mass at the time of death , very massive stars in this predicament might suffer a pair - production instability explosion ( barkat et al .",
    "1967 ; fraley 1968 ; bond , arnett , & carr 1984 ; heger & woosley 2002 ) , where the star s core is obliterated instead of collapsing to a black hole .    however , there are reasons to suspect that the mass - loss properties of stars in the local universe may not be so different from these early stars .",
    "namely , recent studies of line - driven winds from o - type stars and wr stars have shown that their winds are highly clumped , requiring that their mass - loss rates through line - driven winds on the main sequence could be an order of magnitude lower than previously believed ( fullerton et al .",
    "2006 ; bouret et al .",
    "2005 ) . in that case , for stars with initial masses above @xmath440  m@xmath5 that never become rsgs",
    ", the burden of mass loss falls to the post - main - sequence luminous blue variable ( lbv ) phase , when very massive stars suffer multiple giant eruptions that shed several m@xmath5 in just a few years ( smith & owocki 2006 ) .",
    "if these lbv eruptions are not sufficient to remove the star s entire outer hydrogen envelope fast enough , as may be the case for the most massive stars above 100  m@xmath5 , then the star would seem to explode early as an lbv producing a type iin event .",
    "interestingly , gal - yam et al .",
    "( 2007 ) find that the rate of type iin events is in broad agreement with the hypothesis that they are the explosions of extreme lbvs .",
    "the fact that giant lbv eruptions are continuum driven may hint that low - metallicity stars may be capable of shedding mass after all ( smith & owocki 2006 ) , which would affect the range of initial masses that are subject to the pair instability in population iii stars . because stars that begin their lives above 100  m@xmath5 are so few in number , their end fates are poorly constrained by observations ( see gal - yam et al .",
    "2007 for relevant discussion ) , and are still an open question . for these reasons ,",
    "any potential detection of a pair - instability supernova in the modern universe would be of great interest to stellar astrophysics . here",
    "we explore this notion , along with others , as a possible explanation for the bizarre properties of sn  2006gy .",
    "sn  2006gy in the peculiar s0/sa galaxy ngc  1260 was discovered and confirmed by the texas supernova search ( tss ; quimby 2006a ) with the rotse  iiib telescope ( akerlof et al .",

    "( 2006 ) nearly simultaneously suggested that the object was instead a bright active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "however , in the subsequent month , our group continued to follow sn  2006gy , and with additional astrometric , photometric , and spectroscopic data we announced that it did indeed appear to be a sn after all , and not an agn ( foley et al .",
    "in this paper we present additional data and analysis of sn  2006gy , leading us to propose that it marked the death of a very massive star with much of its hydrogen envelope still intact , while surrounded by a massive circumstellar nebula . in many respects ,",
    "the type of progenitor we infer for sn  2006gy resembles the lbv star @xmath3  carinae in our own galaxy , as discussed below .",

    "the red continuum shape of sn  2006gy is unusual for sne  iin , which are typically much bluer ( schlegel 1990 ) , so we have plotted the sn  2006gy spectrum after removal of various amounts of reddening for comparison .",

    "the h@xmath6 profile in figure  [ fig : ha ] reveals several different characteristic velocities relevant to interpretations of sn  2006gy .",
    "first , the very narrow emission component ( fwhm @xmath24 100 km s@xmath7 ) has an associated p cygni absorption feature that indicates outflow speeds of 130 km s@xmath7 ( the trough ) to 260 km s@xmath7 ( the blue edge ) in the unshocked circumstellar gas .",
    "in addition to h@xmath6 , several lines identified in figs  [ fig : lick ] and [ fig : ha ] also have narrow absorption features .",
    "a broad h@xmath6 emission component has an apparent fwhm @xmath24 2400 km s@xmath7 that is similar to h@xmath25 at early times ( harutyunyan et al .  2006 ) .",
    "the true unabsorbed fwhm of this broad h@xmath6 component is larger because of the broad blueshifted absorption .",
    "extended faint wings out to @xmath146,000 km s@xmath7 may be caused either by electron scattering or by the fastest sn ejecta .",
    "the blue edge of the broad , blueshifted h@xmath6 absorption in figure  [ fig : ha ] indicates an outflow speed of 4,000 km s@xmath7 , where the emission jumps back up just to the level that would be expected for a symmetric profile .",
    "this jump is readily apparent when we take the redshifted side of the broad emission profile and reflect it to the blue side , to simulate what a symmetric profile would look like ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ha ] ) . because this absorption traces the speed of the dominant absorbing material along the line of sight at this epoch , we take this speed of 4,000 km s@xmath7 to represent dense material swept up by the sn blast wave in the circumstellar material ( csm ) interaction hypothesis , which should closely trace the speed of the blast wave itself .",
    "the broad - line profile differs from the smooth broad parts of h@xmath6 profiles normally seen in sne  iin ( e.g. , chugai et al.2004 ) .",
    "the blueshifted absorption trough flattens out and does not descend below the underlying continuum level .",
    "this may hint that the continuum luminosity and h@xmath6 emission / absorption have different origins , and provides important clues to the shell optical depth and csm density .",
    "for example , the blueshifted absorption may arise in shocked csm gas , whereas the continuum luminosity may originate in the sn ejecta .",
    "asymmetric geometry in the csm obviously may be relevant .",
    "these details have some bearing on the hypotheses for the power sources discussed in  3.3 and  3.4 . in any case , this broad , blueshifted h@xmath6 absorption probably shares an origin with the broad , blueshifted absorption features for other lines identified in figure  [ fig : lick ] . in light of possible geometric complexities ,",

    "sn  2006gy has quickly distinguished itself as unique from other sne in two important ways .",
    "first , after correcting for distance and extinction , it is the most luminous sn ever seen , and second , it has exhibited a remarkably slow rise to its peak luminosity , and has stayed bright for a very extended time .",
    "sn  2006gy has peaked and is now on a slow decline , but even after 200  d it is still as luminous as the peak of a typical sn  ia .",
    "sn  2006gy was classified as a sn  iin with narrow hydrogen lines in its spectrum at early times ( harutyunyan et al .",
    "2006 ) , although the spectrum has notable differences compared with prototypes of this class .",
    "it dramatically violates the expectation that sne  ii are generally less luminous than sne  ia ( fig .",
    "2 includes a fairly typical type ii sn 1999em ) , and that sne  iin usually take only @xmath420  d to reach their peak ( li et al .",
    "sn  2006gy , by contrast , took @xmath470  d to gradually climb to its peak . for about 100  d",
    "it was more luminous than @xmath33 mag , brighter than any other sn known to date .",
    "simply put , for a supernova to be extremely luminous and to remain that way for such an extended time is truly spectacular .",
    "integrating the light curve in figure 2 and assuming zero bolometric correction , we calculate a total radiated energy of @xmath34 erg .",
    "this requires either very efficient conversion of blast - wave kinetic energy into light , or some alternative energy source .",
    "one or a combination of the three following traditional mechanisms may power the visual light : ( 1 ) h recombination / thermal radiation of the supernova ejecta , ( 2 ) interaction of the supernova blast wave with the csm , or ( 3 ) energy from radioactive decay of @xmath2ni . continued observations and probably extensive theoretical work will be needed to choose decisively between these options , but here we argue that regardless of which of these three mechanisms is responsible , the extreme energy budget of sn  2006gy requires that its very massive progenitor star retained its h envelope until it exploded .",
    "the first option of thermal emission from the h - recombination front in the supernova debris would require a huge ejected mass of order 100 m@xmath5 or more , based simply on the total radiated energy . a heavy h envelope might help explain the unusually slow speed of only about 4000 km  s@xmath7 indicated by the h@xmath6 line ( fig.[fig : ha ] ) , and",
    "might provide a natural explanation for the long duration and rise time of the sn because of time needed for energy to diffuse out of the massive envelope .",
    "whether or not the sn could actually radiate efficiently enough to produce the observed luminosity with this mechanism remains to be proven and should be investigated with detailed calculations .",
    "for example , at the temperature of the photosphere defined by the h - recombination front ( typically 5000  k to 8000  k ) , the luminosity of sn  2006gy requires an emitting radius larger than what we might expect from its observed expansion speed of 40004500 km  s@xmath7 and age . instead of 70  d , the observed peak luminosity would seem to require an age of 200380  d since explosion ( assuming linear motion ) , or rapid deceleration at early times .",
    "such rapid deceleration at early times can not be ruled out by our data .",
    "the second option of powering the visible light entirely with csm interaction is problematic , but is difficult to rule out conclusively .",
    "> from the relatively weak soft x - ray flux of sn 2006gy detected by _",
    "chandra _ , we derive an upper limit to the progenitor star s mass - loss rate of @xmath35 m@xmath5 yr@xmath7 ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "we find that this falls short of the circumstellar density that would be needed to power the visual light curve of sn  2006gy by three orders of magnitude (  3.3 ) . in order to explain the high luminosity in whole or in part by csm interaction",
    ", one would therefore need to assume that the x - ray emission is severely quenched and that the _ chandra _ detection is erroneous  but this is difficult to accept , since we clearly detect soft ( unabsorbed , not hard ) x - ray emission from the position of the sn ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xrayimage ] ) .",
    "even if it were true , though , a closer look at the demands placed on the circumstellar density make it difficult to explain with anything other than a massive star that coincidentally had an lbv outburst just before the supernova explosion .    finally , the third option , radioactive decay of @xmath2ni , is perhaps the least problematic , as we will discuss further in  3.4 .",
    "the main point of interest is that if this mechanism powers the visual light , then the high luminosity of sn  2006gy requires a very large ni mass that can not arise from a normal core - collapse sn . instead",

    "note , however , that benetti et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have instead argued in favor of a core - collapse origin for sn  2002ic , so the true nature of these events is still controversial .",

    "( 2004 ) .",
    "we argue here that the first scenario ( sn  iia ) is untenable for sn  2006gy for a number of reasons . based in part on a preprint of our work presented here",

    "the second sn  1994w - like scenario , on the other hand , is almost certainly relevant to sn  2006gy , but based on the weak x - ray emission we probably require a different source for the bulk of the radiated luminosity .",
    "if , for the sake of argument , we demand that csm interaction powers the luminosity , we find that the extraordinary energy demands of sn  2006gy point to a circumstellar environment that is only likely to be produced by a very massive star that suffered a rare outburst immediately prior to the sn . in the case of sn  2006gy ,",
    "the luminosity and total energy need to be scaled up by a factor of 40 or more from those for sn  1994w .    in order to power the luminosity of sn  2006gy with csm interaction ,",

    "ofek et al .",
    "( 2007 ) originally ( version 1 of astro - ph/0612408 ) estimated that to achieve the luminosity of sn  2006gy with a shock plowing into csm , the progenitor star ( or its companion star in a close binary system ) needed to have a wind with an average mass - loss rate of @xmath410@xmath55 m@xmath5 yr@xmath7 in the decades before explosion .",

    "recall , however , that this required value of 0.5 m@xmath5 yr@xmath7 is 1000 times above the highest likely value indicated by x - ray emission , making it problematic ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "let us put this last issue aside for the time being , assuming that the x - rays are somehow absorbed without hardening the spectrum , so that we can consider the implications of the csm interaction hypothesis .",
    "the expansion speed indicated by the h@xmath6 line ( fig.[fig : ha ] ) is critical for addressing the extent to which interaction with csm may power the observed radiation , because the fwhm@xmath242400 km s@xmath7 of the main intermediate - width emission component in figure  [ fig : ha ] has changed little from the initial value of fwhm@xmath242500 km  s@xmath7 seen in the h@xmath25 emission feature only a few days after discovery ( harutyunyan et al.2006 ) .",
    "( recall that if the sn is powered by csm interaction , then the observed expansion speed traces the blast - wave speed , and not the decrease in speed expected as the h recombination front progress deeper into the sn ejecta . )",
    "if the expanding blast wave has only slowed by about 10% in the first few months , conservation of momentum dictates that the mass of swept - up material is only about 10% of the ejected mass .",
    "since at least a few m@xmath5 of material needs to be swept up to power the luminosity of sn  2006gy  d ) , and the relative speed of the blast wave and circumstellar material : @xmath63 , which gives about 2.5 m@xmath5 . ] , the mass of the sn ejecta then needs to be _ at least _ 25 m@xmath5 .",
    "this clearly rules out a type ia event . another way to approach",
    "the problem is that if the ejecta only slow by 10% after discovery , then only @xmath420% of the initial kinetic energy can be converted into radiation during that time .",
    "the huge radiated energy of sn  2006gy would then require a sn with @xmath64 erg , again too great a demand for a sn  ia , even in a double - degenerate scenario or a super - chandrasekhar - mass white dwarf . in short",
    ", one can not extract enough energy from the shock to power the light curve without slowing down the shock , unless the initial mass and kinetic energy of the sn ejecta are high .",
    "even if we somehow allow for very efficient conversion of all the @xmath65 erg of blast - wave kinetic energy into radiation , we must ask : _ what type of progenitor star is likely to have had such a stupendous mass - loss rate ? _ a rate of 0.5 m@xmath5 yr@xmath7 would be unheard of for a low - mass ( 28 m@xmath5 ) asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star , which is the most likely type of star to expect in the sn  iia scenario , for which observed mass - loss rates are four to five orders of magnitude lower ( de jager et al .  1988 ) .",
    "even the most extreme oh / ir stars have rates below @xmath66 m@xmath5 yr@xmath7 ( netzer & knapp 1987 ) , while the highest rates during the final and brief protoplanetary nebula phase reach only ( 12 ) @xmath67 10@xmath68 m@xmath5 yr@xmath7 ( bujarrabal et al .  2001 ) .",
    "in fact , it is also more than 4 orders of magnitude larger than the eddington accretion rate for a white dwarf , which would be relevant in a common - envelope scenario .",
    "even massive stars in their normal ( i.e. , non - eruptive ) states do not come close to this rate .",
    "the only type of star known to have a mass - loss rate higher than 0.1 m@xmath5 yr@xmath7 would be an lbv during a giant eruption ( smith & owocki 2006 ) . those events typically last about a decade or less ( van dyk 2005 ) , which would be of the right order ( @xmath69 ) to account for the required circumstellar environment of sn 2006gy .",
    "the outbursts are impulsive , so the large masses in their nebulae ( smith & owocki 2006 ) averaged over the durations of the visible eruptions yield these mass - loss rates .",
    "if it were the case that the pre - sn mass - loss event before sn  2006gy was of such short duration , then we would predict the luminosity of sn  2006gy to soon plummet rapidly to the late - time luminosity of a normal sn  ii .",
    "if such a drop is not observed , it will strengthen the case for the pair - instability hypothesis discussed next in  3.4 .",
    "such a sudden drop was clearly seen in sn  1994w at roughly day 110 ( chugai et al.2004 ) .",
    "this interpretation , though , forces us back once again to the hypothesis that the progenitor was an extremely massive star , since only the most powerful lbv outbursts from the most massive stars with initial masses above @xmath4100 m@xmath5 are known to have such high mass - loss rates . coincidentally , the mass - loss rate of @xmath3 carinae during its phenomenal 1843 eruption was about 0.5 m@xmath5 yr@xmath7 if averaged over 20 years ( smith et al .",
    "another such extreme case is sn  1961v in ngc  1058 ( goodrich et al .",

    "1995 ; van dyk et al .",
    "2002 ) , which is thought to have had an initial mass well above 100 m@xmath5 . to expect such an extraordinary feat from a low - mass or intermediate - mass star is unreasonable even in the most imaginative circumstances .",
    "further difficulties for the sn  iia scenario  and even for moderately massive progenitors  arise if we consider geometry . if one attempts to account for the unusually dense circumstellar environment by invoking a high mass - loss rate tidal stripping `` event '' in a close binary or common envelope / merger , for example , then this would almost certainly distributed material in a flattened disk as mass is shed from the system through the outer lagrangian point ( e.g. , taam & ricker 2006 ) . in that case , however , even with 100% efficiency in the local conversion of kinetic energy into radiation , the global fraction of energy available is only that of the solid angle that can be intercepted by the disk  which will probably be less than 10% .    altogether , then , there are several clear reasons why the type iia scenario originally advocated by ofek et al .",
    "( 2007 , version 1 of astro - ph/0612408 ) fails to power sn  2006gy through csm interaction .",

    "while the continuum of the earliest spectrum of sn  2005gj was relatively featureless , it too developed the prominent broad iron lines typical of a sn  ia by two months after explosion ( aldering et al .",

    "we therefore have no compelling reason to believe that an exploding white dwarf was present in this event .",
    "we find that conversion of the blast - wave kinetic energy into radiated luminosity might potentially power sn  2006gy , as has been proposed for sn  1994w ( chugai et al .",
    "2004 ) , but only if the swept - up environment is consistent with extreme environments observed around the most massive evolved stars known , such as @xmath3 carinae .",

    "we are left with a choice : either this is such an unlikely event that the underlying power source for sn  2006gy must be some other mechanism and csm interaction only contributes a fraction of the radiated energy ( see  3.4 ) , or instead , it is an indication that giant lbv eruptions may be a sign of things to come  i.e. , an `` early warning sign '' of an impending sn",

    "interestingly , this is similar to the case of sn  1987a , where the progenitor was a blue supergiant with a small radius , and where its late ( 70100  d ) peak was powered by radioactive @xmath2co decay .",

    "( 2005 ) predict slow expansion speeds of @xmath45000 km  s@xmath7 and the presence of h in the spectrum , again compatible with sn  2006gy .",
    "these clues are tantalizing , and it would be interesting to see models for pair - instability sne at metallicity closer to solar values and with compact progenitors .",
    "this is still somewhat virgin territory and will require continued observational constraints and detailed calculations to find a suitable model that will work for the case of sn  2006gy .",
    "below we sketch a plausibility argument for the hypothesis that sn  2006gy was a pair - instability sn based simply on the required power source for its radiated luminosity .",
    "the @xmath15-band magnitude at the peak of sn  2006gy was at least as bright as @xmath021.8 , but could have been significantly brighter because of our conservative assumptions for the reddening , as noted in ",
    " 2.1 and 2.2 .",
    "assuming no bolometric correction ( again , conservative ) , this corresponds to a peak luminosity of @xmath70 erg s@xmath7 .",

    "the extreme luminosity of sn  2006gy , then , would require an extraordinarily high ni mass of roughly 22 m@xmath5 to be synthesized in the explosion .",

    "independent of the energy - budget arguments , the properties of the unshocked circumstellar gas around the progenitor of sn  2006gy are also consistent with the interpretation that it was a very massive star , and provide critical clues that strongly refute the hypothesis that it was powered by the type ia explosion of a low - mass star interacting with dense csm . the high - resolution spectrum in figure  [ fig :",

( 2002 ) , however , interpreted it somewhat differently as a fast blue - supergiant wind sweeping into a red - supergiant wind . significant acceleration of the slow red - supergiant wind would require a swept - up mass comparable to the fast - wind mass shortly before the sn , which makes this scenario implausible in the case of sn  2006gy because of the large mass implied .",
    "the typical lbv ejecta speed agrees well with our constraints from  3.3 .",
    "narrow blueshifted absorption components similar to h@xmath6 are seen in a number of other lines throughout the spectrum of sn  2006gy along with some relatively broad blueshifted absorption ( figs .",
    "[ fig : lick ] and [ fig : ha ] ) .",
    "those absorption features are not always present ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lick ] ) , while narrow h@xmath6 emission remains .",
    "thus , we can not be certain that the narrow emission and absorption components of h@xmath6 constitute a true p cygni scattering profile , so we consider both cases here .",
    "for each case , the luminosity of the narrow h@xmath6 emission component is a relevant quantity . at a distance of 73 mpc , the luminosity of the narrow emission component of the h@xmath6 line on day 96 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ha ] ) is @xmath77  l@xmath5 ( the absolute flux was calibrated by scaling the red continuum to match observed kait photometry at the appropriate date and correcting for @xmath78 mag ) .",
    "note that the true luminosity may be somewhat larger than this because the apparent luminosity may be reduced by the blueshifted narrow absorption .",
    "if the narrow h@xmath6 component arises in an unshocked csm wind , we can make a rough estimae of the density immediately outside the radius of the shock , given by @xmath79 , where we again take @xmath80=4000  km  s@xmath7 and @xmath81  d is the time the keck spectrum was taken .",
    "such estimates are plagued with uncertainties in the ionization fraction and h mass fraction , so the estimate below is a lower limit assuming fully ionized pure h gas . following equation ( 1 ) of chugai & danziger ( 2003 ) , for example , our measured value of @xmath82 implies a density of roughly 2@xmath6710@xmath83 @xmath84 just outside @xmath85  cm ( adopting @xmath86 @xmath87 s@xmath7 for the case  b h@xmath6 recombination coefficient as noted below ) .",
    "if @xmath88 is taken to be 200 km s@xmath7 , this implies a mass - loss rate for the progenitor star of roughly 0.010.02",
    "m@xmath5 yr@xmath7 . while this is an exceptionally high mass - loss rate , higher than what we infer from the x - ray emission (  3.2 ) , it still falls short of what is required to power the visual luminosity of sn  2006gy by more than a factor of 1020 .",
    "it is interesting , however , that this value is comparable to progenitor mass - loss rates estimated for other sne  iin with similar narrow h@xmath6 p cygni features from the unshocked csm , such as sne 1997ab and 1997eg ( salamanca et al .",
    "1998 , 2002 ) .",
    "if the narrow h@xmath6 emission component arises instead from unshocked ionized gas in a detached cs shell nebula , however , then the mass implied would add yet another requirement that the progenitor star was very massive .",
    "it may arise in a circumstellar shell like the homunculus nebula of @xmath3  carinae ( smith 2006 ) , for example .",
    "using @xmath82 , and assuming that the line originates from a circumstellar shell nebula of constant density , the ionized gas mass can be expressed as    @xmath89    where h@xmath90 is the energy of an h@xmath6 photon , @xmath91 @xmath87 s@xmath7 is the case  b h@xmath6 recombination coefficient , and @xmath92 is the average electron density .",
    "this yields @xmath93  m@xmath5 ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "we do not know the electron density in the nebula around sn  2006gy , but values of 10@xmath9510@xmath96 @xmath84 are the highest densities typically seen in young lbv nebulae like the one around @xmath3  carinae ( smith 2006 ) . with the observed h@xmath6 luminosity and densities of this order ,",
    "the nebular mass is probably above 5  m@xmath5 , and it could plausibly be as high as 2030 m@xmath5 .",
    "lower densities typically seen in circumstellar nebulae around lower - mass stars would require implausibly high emitting masses to account for the observed radiation , exceeding their own stellar masses",
    ". environments this massive obviously can not be produced by low - mass stars and are not seen around moderately massive stars of 2040 m@xmath5 , but they are quite typical of the nebular shells around lbvs with @xmath97 l@xmath5 ( smith & owocki 2006 ) , which descend from stars with initial masses of 80150 m@xmath5",
    ". such large masses are consistent with the @xmath9812.5 m@xmath5 nebula around @xmath3  car ( smith et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "thus , the flux of the narrow h@xmath6 component that we observe is only likely to arise in the circumstellar nebula of an extremely massive star . taken together",
    ", this high mass and the shell s expansion speed give self - consistent evidence that the progenitor star was indeed very massive .",
    "this line of reasoning is independent of the uncertainty associated with the mechanism that powers the radiated energy of the sn .",
    "it is also consistent with the presence of strong hydrogen lines in the spectrum , since lbvs have not yet shed their h envelopes .",
    "although dominated by hydrogen , lbv shells also have elevated helium abundances , consistent with the presence of narrow he  i lines in the spectrum of sn  2006gy .",
    "if sn  2006gy really is surrounded by a dense lbv nebula like that of @xmath3 carinae , then we might expect to see strong , narrow emission lines of [ n  ii ] @xmath996548 , 6583 in its late - time spectral evolution , since lbv nebulae like that of @xmath3 car tend to be enriched with cno - cycle ashes ( smith & morse 2004 ) .",
    "sn  2006gy has been compared ( ofek et al . ) to two peculiar supernovae , sn  2002ic and sn  2005gj ( fig .",
    "2 ) , which have been proposed as sne  ia interacting with dense csm ( the so - called `` type iia '' sne ) as noted earlier .",
    "one factor that motivated ofek et al .",
    "( 2007 ) to originally favor the sn  iia hypothesis was that the host galaxy , ngc 1260 , was apparently not a star - forming galaxy .",
    "it should not have massive stars , because s0 galaxies are dominated by old stellar populations .",
    "we note , however , that the sn host is actually a peculiar s0/sa galaxy with infrared ( ir ) emission from dust .",
    "ngc  1260 was detected by the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) , and meusinger , bruzendorf , & krieg ( 2000 ) give an infrared luminosity of log(@xmath100 . according to kennicutt ( 1998 )",
    ", this would translate to a star - formation rate of @xmath41.2 m@xmath5 yr@xmath7 , which is certainly high enough to permit this galaxy to host some massive young stars .",
    "furthermore , we detect extended h@xmath6 and [ n  ii ] @xmath766583 emission from the galaxy in our spectra ; figure  [ fig : longslit ] presents the original long - slit keck spectrum before the h@xmath6 profile of sn  2006gy was extracted , revealing extended emission from gas that follows the rotation curve of the host galaxy .",
    "these emission lines , having intensity ratios typical of h  ii regions , are indicative of current star formation and are absent in non - star - forming galaxies .    a related point concerns the statistics involved .",
    "sn  2006gy is the most luminous sn seen to date , but it is also spectrally peculiar , almost in a class by itself .",
    "its unusual nature would not be at all surprising , in principle , if its origin were the explosion of a @xmath101100 m@xmath5 star , since these stars are so phenomenally rare to begin with .",
    "on the other hand , if it results from normal evolution for low - mass stars or even moderately massive stars of 1040 m@xmath5 , then we would expect such events to be more common .",
    "all available observations are broadly consistent with the hypothesis that the progenitor of sn  2006gy was a very massive star that retained a massive hydrogen envelope until it exploded . retaining this envelope",
    "does not mean that the progenitor was a rsg ; the most luminous stars evolve to the lbv phase before losing their envelopes , and during that phase they are hot supergiants with relatively small radii .",
    "this can strongly affect the early light - curve shape .",
    "a mass below 60 m@xmath5 may be possible if the event was powered by csm interaction , but then one must invoke exceptional conditions inconsistent with observed properties of stars below that mass . if csm interaction dominates , we find it more likely that the progenitor star had an initial mass of 100150 m@xmath5 , although we still lack a satisfactory explanation for the weak unabsorbed x - rays in that case .",
    "by contrast , the huge radiated luminosity , the long duration , the presence of hydrogen in the spectrum , the low expansion speed of the sn ejecta , and the various critical clues from the circumstellar environment are all consistent with the hypothesis that this event was powered by a pair - instability supernova that also has some moderate csm interaction , implying that the progenitor star s initial mass may have been near the upper mass limit for stars of @xmath4150 m@xmath5 ( figer 2005 ) . regardless of the power source , several clues hint that the progenitor star may have resembled the lbv star @xmath3 carinae .",
    "if this hypothesis of explosion as a massive lbv is correct , it would have important consequences for our understanding of stellar evolution .",
    "it is currently thought that variability in the lbv phase is responsible for the mass shedding that marks the transition from the end of core h burning to core he burning , after which a star appears as a he - rich wr star ( abbot & conti 1987 ; langer et al.1994 ; smith & owocki 2006 ; smith et al .",
    "2004 ) . during this brief evolutionary phase",
    ", a massive star might undergo sequential bursts of mass loss when it can repeatedly shed more than 10 m@xmath5 of material in a decade ( smith & owocki 2006 ) .",
    "these events are seen in other galaxies as faint sne  iin , or `` supernova impostors '' ( van dyk 2005 , and references therein ) .",
    "they may dominate the mass loss of the most massive stars , shedding more total mass than line - driven winds during the star s lifetime ( smith & owocki 2006 ) .",
    "consequently , lbv stars are frequently surrounded by circumstellar nebulae with masses of order 10 m@xmath5 , like the one that may reside around sn  2006gy .",
    "it would appear that one of these events may have occurred within a decade or so immediately preceding sn  2006gy .",
    "the core he burning wr phase that should follow after the massive hydrogen envelope is stripped away is expected to last a few hundred thousand years before the star reaches even more advanced stages of nuclear burning and finally explodes ( abbott & conti 1987 ) .",
    "if lbvs explode before reaching the wr phase , though , it means that they could be in more advanced stages of nuclear burning than currently predicted by stellar evolution theory .",
    "sn  2006gy adds to mounting evidence ( e.g. , smith & owocki 2006 ; kotak & vink 2006 ; gal - yam et al .  2007 ;",
    "smith 2007 ) that stars may explode `` early '' during the lbv phase , and it hints that reaching the pair instability could be a reason for this .",
    "it seems intuitively possible , although difficult to prove , that it would be the most massive lbvs above @xmath4100 m@xmath5 that are more likely to explode prematurely as they have a greater burden of removing their massive envelopes before transitioning to wr stars .",
    "gal - yam et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have drawn a similar conjecture , considering lbvs as the most likely progenitors of sne iin .",
    "if the most massive stars can indeed explode before the wr phase , then our current ignorance of the instability underlying the lbv phase presents a critical challenge . the possibility that sn 2006gy could have been a pair - instability supernova weighs heavily upon the importance of understanding these lbvs as well .",
    "sn  2006gy may be giving us a clue that the wild instability of the most luminous lbvs like @xmath3  carinae could be early warning signs of a massive star s imminent demise , and there may be theoretical reasons to think this is the case .",
    "one implication is that we had better keep a watchful eye on @xmath3  carinae .",
    "the chief reason why pair - instability sne are expected to occur for high - mass stars in the early universe is because their low metal content is expected to reduce their mass - loss rates , causing them to retain their massive h envelopes ( heger et al .",
    "2003 ; heger & woosley 2002 ; although see smith & owocki 2006 ) . also , the initial mass function of the first stars is thought to have been skewed to higher masses due to the lack of metal cooling and consequent fragmentation in the star - formation process ( e.g. , bromm & larson 2004 ) .",
    "sn  2006gy may have been a very massive star that exploded as an lbv _ before _ it could shed its h envelope , and it may have done so by the pair - instability mechanism .    the fact that sn  2006gy was able to explode successfully instead of winking away into a black hole has far - reaching implications .",
    "in particular , one primary goal of the _ james webb space telescope _ will be to search for these first explosions in the universe , and the brilliant display of sn  2006gy may bode well for the possibility of their infrared detection at high redshift .",
