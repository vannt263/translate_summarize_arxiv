    "pks  0537@xmath0441 ( also known as hb89  0537@xmath0441 , rx  j0538.8@xmath04405 ) was selected as a quasi - stellar source in the parkes 2700 mhz radio survey @xcite and identified as a blazar by @xcite . according to its spectral energy distribution the source was classified as a bl lac object , categorized as a low - energy - peaked bl lac by @xcite , although the determination of the redshift of this source is based on broad emission lines and the object has been listed as a highly polarized quasar @xcite , having radio polarization up to 3@xmath5 @xcite and optical polarization up to 18@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "pks 0537@xmath0441 has also been suggested to be a transition object between classical bl lac objects and violently variable and highly polarized quasars @xcite .",
    "two broad emission lines at 3617 and 5304 were observed in the optical spectrum of pks  0537@xmath0441 , and proposed to correspond to the c iii@xmath6 $ ] @xmath71909 and mgii @xmath72798 lines , placing the object at a redshift z = 0.894 @xcite .",
    "subsequently , @xcite reported a redshift of z = 0.892 @xmath8 0.001 , based on the balmer line series and the [ o iii ] emission line .",
    "pks  0537@xmath0441 was also observed by the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) of the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) in 1993 july and september and , on the basis of their measured central wavelengths , the emission lines detected in the hst fos spectra were identified by @xcite with ly @xmath9 , si iv and c iv at z = 0.896 @xmath8 0.001 , a value consistent with the original redshift determination by @xcite .",
    "based on a claimed detection of a galaxy along the line of sight to pks 0537@xmath0441 , it was discussed as a case of gravitational lensing @xcite , in which a foreground galaxy lenses the radiation from the quasar , amplifying the continuum with respect to the line emission , but further observations reported in @xcite have not confirmed the presence of a foreground galaxy .",
    "given its apparent brightness , pks 0537@xmath0441 is an excellent target for studying the properties of blazars and therefore it has been the subject of several monitoring campaigns from radio to optical , showing remarkable variability .",
    "@xcite , who found quasi stellar objects ( qsos ) among the parkes radio sources , discovered the optical counterpart of the radio source pks 0537@xmath0441 to be 2 mag brighter than on the palomar observatory sky survey .",

    "although pks 0537@xmath0441 is one of the brightest radio selected bl lac objects @xcite it is a relatively weak x - ray source @xcite , even if the comparison of the rosat x - ray spectrum with the _ einstein _ and exosat observations indicates substantial variability both in intensity and spectral slope at x - rays ( * ? ? ?",

    "moreover , the bepposax spectrum suggests that a single emission component dominates in the energy range 0.130 kev @xcite .",
    "previous multifrequency observations from near - ir to x - rays @xcite showed quasi - simultaneous flares at ir , optical , and x - ray frequencies .",
    "its continuum variations throughout the entire electromagnetic spectrum have been discussed in detail by @xcite . in 2005 pks 0537441",
    "was monitored in the optical and infrared by rem @xcite and observed by all the instruments on board _ swift _ in january , july , and november @xcite , with a flux that varied by a factor of @xmath1060 and @xmath104 in optical and x - rays , respectively .",
    "the @xmath11-band and x - ray light curves measured in 20042005 were highly correlated , although with different variation amplitudes . in contrast , no clear evidence of variability within a single night was found , even though some hints of small flares on day time - scales may be present . moreover the x - ray photon index was observed to be steady over the different epochs , as opposed to the variation of the fluxes .",

    "these attempts failed , as expected for fsrqs and some lsp bl lacs .",
    "we then added an external compton ( ec ) component of seed photons from a dust torus .",

    "these model fits are shown as curves in figure [ sed ] , and the model parameters can be found in table [ table_fit ] .",

    "this has been found for numerous other fsrqs and lsp bl lacs @xcite , most notably for the extremely @xmath2-ray bright fsrq 3c  454.3 @xcite .",
    "the cause of this curvature , often characterized as a spectral break ( when fit with a double power - law ) is a bit of a mystery .",
    "it has been suggested that it is due to a feature in the electron distribution @xcite ; due to @xmath99 absorption of @xmath2-rays with he  ii ly@xmath9 broad line photons @xcite ; due to a combination of compton scattering of two seed photon sources , for example , directly from the accretion disc , and from broad line emission @xcite ; or due to klein - nishina effects from compton - scattering of h  i ly@xmath9 photons @xcite . in the `` high state ''",
    "sed for pks  0537@xmath0441 , there is clearly a spectral break in the ir - optical spectrum , around @xmath100  hz ( @xmath101 m ) .",
    "the combination of a break found in both the synchrotron and compton - scattered spectrum seems to indicate a common origin for the break , most likely due to an intrinsic feature in the underlying electron distribution .",
    "indeed , that is how we model it for this source . although the broken ir / optical spectrum in the `` high state '' , and the curved @xmath2-ray spectrum in the `` average state '' are not contemporaneous , there does seem to be a hint of curvature in the `` high state '' lat spectrum , especially when the upper limit in the highest energy bin is considered .",
    "it is certainly possible , maybe even likely , that the cause of the @xmath2-ray spectral breaks in all blazars which show them is related to features in the electron distribution , although one should be careful not to over - generalise .",
    "simultaneous ir , optical and @xmath2-ray observations of other blazars could be very useful for making this determination , although contamination in the ir by a dust torus ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or another synchrotron component ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could make this difficult .",
    "the three states differ very little in the radio and x - rays .",
    "this emission is caused by synchrotron and ec emission , respectively , of the lower portion of the electron distribution , although there is some additional ssc emission for the x - rays .",
    "consequently , the jet power in electrons ( see table [ table_fit ] ) varies little between states , since the @xmath102 portion of the electron distribution contains most of the electrons energy .",
    "the model implies emission very close to equipartition between electrons and poynting flux for all model fits , with a slight dominance of poynting flux .",
    "we presented multiwavelength observations of pks 0537@xmath0441 during a period of 20 months ( 2008 august2010 april ) including _ fermi _ , _ swift _ , atom , rem , and sma data .",
    "strong variability has been observed in @xmath2 rays , with two major flaring episodes ( 2009 july and 2010 march ) and a harder - when - brighter spectral behaviour , quite common for fsrqs and lsp bl lacs , in 2010 march . the average lat spectrum accumulated over 20 months showed a significant curvature , well described both by a bpl model with @xmath67 = ( 2290 @xmath8 390 ) mev and a log - parabola model . a quite steep pds slope ( @xmath9 = 1.5 @xmath8 0.2 ) has been estimated , in agreement with those observed for the brightest fsrqs @xcite , suggesting a random - walk underlying mechanism .",
    "only moderate variability has been observed in x - rays with no correlation between flux and photon index .",
    "an increase of the flux in the x - ray band with no counterpart at the other wavelengths has been observed in 2008 october , suggesting a significant contribution of a second component ( e.g. ssc emission ) in some high activity states .",
    "no clear correlation of the x - ray emission with the nir or optical bands has been found .",
    "only a correlation with the gamma - ray band has been observed .",
    "in addition we observed correlation between the @xmath2-ray band with the @xmath3-band and more weakly with the @xmath4-band , with no significant time lag .",
    "however , together with this `` overall '' correlation we note that on finer timescales the light curves showed differences .",
    "in particular , two flaring episodes in nir and optical bands have been observed in 2009 september and even more strongly in 2009 november with no significant counterparts in @xmath2 rays .",
    "as seen for fsrqs and lsp bl lacs , the sed of the source can not be modelled by a simple ssc model .",
    "we included an ec component of seed photons from a dust torus .",
    "the 230 ghz light curve showed an increase simultaneously with the @xmath2 rays , suggesting co - spatiality of the mm and @xmath2-ray emission regions at large distance from the central engine and thus the dust torus as the possible main source of seed photons . the low , average , and high activity seds of the source could be fit by changing only the electron distribution parameters .",
    "this has been observed previously for mrk 501 @xcite , although this is a high - synchrotron - peaked bl lac , while pks 0537 - 441 is an lsp bl lac / fsrq . in our modeling , we have found that two breaks in the electron distribution are necessary .",
    "a spectral break in the nir - optical spectrum has been found , in agreement also with a significant change of the flux variability amplitude below and above the @xmath3-band .",
    "this break together with the curvature observed in @xmath2 rays ( possibly characterized as a spectral break ) seems to indicate a common origin for them , most likely due to an intrinsic feature in the underlying electron distribution .",
    "broad emission lines have been observed during a low activity state of pks 0537@xmath0441 @xcite , in contrast with the initial classification as a bl lac object .",
    "however , recent studies of a large sample of blazars showed that a classification depending only on their optical / uv spectral properties is not efficient to distinguish fsrqs and bl lac objects @xcite .",
    "variability and spectral properties in @xmath2 rays indicate a fsrq - like behaviour , in agreement also with the sed properties .",
    "the observed isotropic @xmath2-ray luminosity in the 0.1100 gev energy range is 8.2@xmath1310@xmath103 erg s@xmath16 for the 20-month interval considered , reaching a peak value of 2.6@xmath1310@xmath104 erg s@xmath16 on 3-day time scale at the end of 2010 march .",
