    "in leading order ( lo ) prompt photons originating in the hard interaction between two partons are produced mainly via quark - gluon compton scattering ( @xmath2 ) or quark  anti - quark annihilation ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "studies of direct photons with large transverse momenta , @xmath4 , provide precision tests of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) as well as information on the distribution of partons within protons , particularly the gluon .",
    "these data are also used in global fits of parton distributions functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "the lo contributions to di - photon production are quark  anti - quark annihilation ( @xmath5 ) and gluon - gluon scattering ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the latter subprocess involves initial state gluons coupling to the photons through a quark box ; thus the subprocess is suppressed by a factor @xmath7 .",
    "the rate is still high for small @xmath8 masses due to the large flux of gluons .",
    "processes where both photons originate from parton fragmentation or where one photon is prompt and one photon is from parton fragmentation also contribute in lo .",
    "di - photon final states are not only interesting to study pqcd but they are also signatures for many new physics processes , such as higgs production at the lhc or large extra dimensions .    d  has measured the cross section for the inclusive production of isolated photons in the range @xmath9 gev .",
    "this extends previous measurements in this energy regime  [ 15 ] to significantly higher values of @xmath4 .",
    "cdf has measured the di - photon cross - section in @xmath10 collisions  @xcite .",
    "both measurements are restricted to photons in the pseudorapidity range @xmath11 .",
    "the data samples correspond to an integrated luminosity of about @xmath12  pb@xmath13 for d  and @xmath14  pb@xmath13 for cdf .",
    "photons from energetic @xmath15 and @xmath16 mesons are the main background to direct photon production especially at small @xmath4 .",
    "since these mesons are produced inside jets , their contribution is suppressed with respect to direct photons by requiring the photon be isolated from other particles .",
    "photon candidates in d  were formed from clusters of calorimeter cells within a cone .",
    "candidates were selected if there was significant energy in the electromagnetic ( em ) calorimeter layers ( @xmath17 ) , and the probability to have a spatially - matched track was less than @xmath18 , and they satisfied an isolation requirement .",
    "potential backgrounds from cosmic rays and leptonic @xmath19 boson decays were suppressed by requiring the missing transverse energy to be less than @xmath20 .",
    "four additional variables were input to an artificial neural network ( nn ) to further suppress background and to estimate the purity of the resulting photon sample .",
    "the nn was trained to discriminate between direct photons and qcd as well as electroweak background events .",
    "the total number of photon candidates remaining after these requirements is 2.7 million .",
    "the isolated - photon cross section @xmath21 is measured by performing an unsmearing as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "this is done by iteratively fitting the convolution of an ansatz function with an energy resolution function .",
    "the uncertainty in this correction was estimated using two different ansatz functions and included the uncertainty in the energy resolution .",
    "an additional correction was applied to @xmath4 for the difference in the energy deposited in the material upstream of the calorimeter between electrons and photons .    the measured cross section , together with statistical and systematic uncertainties , is presented in fig .  [ fig : dtleft]a .",
    "sources of systematic uncertainty include luminosity ( @xmath22 ) , event vertex determination ( @xmath23 ) , energy calibration ( @xmath24 ) , the fragmentation model ( @xmath25 ) , photon conversions ( @xmath26 ) , and the photon purity fit uncertainty as well as statistical uncertainties on the determination of geometrical acceptance ( @xmath27 ) , trigger efficiency ( @xmath28 ) , selection efficiency ( @xmath29 ) and unsmearing ( @xmath27 ) .",
