    "the present paper is motivated by the study of certain non linear free boundary value problems for hyperbolic systems of partial differential equations arising in _ magneto - hydrodynamics _ ( mhd ) .",
    "the well - posedness of initial boundary value problems for hyperbolic pdes was studied by kreiss @xcite for systems and sakamoto @xcite for wave equations .",
    "the theory was extended to free - boundary problems for a discontinuity by majda @xcite .",
    "he related the discontinuity problem to a half - space problem by adding a new variable that describes the displacement of the discontinuity , and making a change of independent variables that flattensthe discontinuity front .",
    "the result is a system of hyperbolic pdes that is coupled with an equation for the displacement of the discontinuity .",
    "majda formulated analogs of the lopatinski and uniform lopatinski conditions for discontinuity problems , and proved a short - time , nonlinear existence and stability result for lax shocks in solutions of hyperbolic conservation laws that satisfy the uniform lopatinski condition ( see @xcite for further discussion ) .",
    "interesting and challenging problems arise when the discontinuity is weakly but not strongly stable , i.e. the lopatinski condition only holds in weak form , because surface waves propagate along the discontinuity , see @xcite .",
    "a general theory for the evolution of such weakly stable discontinuities is lacking .",
    "a typical difficulty in the analysis of weakly stable problems is the loss of regularity in the a priori estimates of solutions .",
    "short - time existence results have been obtained for various weakly stable nonlinear problems , typically by the use of a nash - moser scheme to compensate for the loss of derivatives in the linearized energy estimates , see @xcite .",
    "a fundamental part of the general approach described above is given by the proof of the well - posedness of the linear boundary value problems ( shortly written bvps in the sequel ) obtained from linearizing the nonlinear problem ( in the new independent variables with flattenedboundary ) around a suitable basic state .",
    "this requires two things : the proof of a linearized energy estimate , and the existence of the solution to the linearized problem .    in case of certain problems arising in mhd",
    ", a spectral analysis of the linearized equations , as required by the kreiss - lopatinski theory , seems very hard to be obtained because of big algebraic difficulties .",
    "an alternative approach for the proof of the linearized a priori estimate is the energy method .",
    "this method has been applied successfully to the linearized mhd problems by trakhinin ( see @xcite and other references ) ; typically the method gives an a priori estimate for the solution in the conormal sobolev space @xmath0 ( see section [ fs ] for the definition of this space ) bounded by the norm of the source term in the same function space ( or a space of higher order in case of loss of regularity ) .",
    "once given the a priori estimate , the next point requires the proof of the existence of the solution to the linearized problem .",
    "here one finds a new difficulty .",
    "the classical duality method for the existence of a weak @xmath1 solution requires an a priori estimate for the dual problem ( usually similar to the given linearized problem ) of the form @xmath2 ( from the data in the interior to the solution , disregarding for simplicity the boundary regularity ) . in case of loss of derivatives , when for the problem it is given an estimate of the form @xmath3 , one would need an estimate of the form @xmath4 for the dual problem , see @xcite .    the existence of a solution directly in @xmath0 would require an a priori estimate for the dual problem in the dual spaces @xmath5 ( possibly of the form @xmath6 in case of loss of regularity ) , but it is not clear how to get it .",
    "this difficulty motivates the present paper .",
    "we show that an a priori estimate of the solution to certain bvps in the conormal sobolev space @xmath0 can be transformed into an @xmath1 a priori estimate , with the consequence that the existence of a weak @xmath1 solution can be obtained by the classical duality argument .",
    "the most of the paper is devoted to the proof of this result . in the appendix we present some examples of free - boundary problems in mhd that fit in the general formulation described below .    for a given integer @xmath7 , let @xmath8 denote the @xmath9dimensional positive half - space @xmath10 we also use the notation @xmath11 .",
    "the boundary of @xmath8 will be sistematically identified with @xmath12 .",
    "we are interested in a boundary value problem of the following form    [ sbvp ] @xmath13    in , @xmath14 is the first - order linear partial differential operator @xmath15 where the shortcut @xmath16 , for @xmath17 , is used hereafter and @xmath18 denotes the @xmath19 identity matrix .",
    "the coefficients @xmath20 , @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) are @xmath19 real matrix - valued functions in @xmath23 , the space of restrictions to @xmath8 of functions of @xmath24 , @xmath25 are used throughout the paper to mean the space of functions taking either scalar or matrix values ( possibly with different sizes ) .",
    "we adopt the same abuse for other function spaces later on . ] .",

    "the classical approach consists , firstly , of reducing the original free boundary problem to a bvp set on a fixed domain , performing a nonlinear change of coordinates that sends the front of the physical discontinuities into a fixed hyperplane of the space - time domain .",

    "the resulting linear problem displays the structure of the problem , where the unknown @xmath51 represents the set of physical variables involved in the model , while the unknown @xmath55 encodes the moving discontinuity front .",
    "the solvability of the linear bvp firstly requires that a suitable a priori estimate can be attached to the problem .",
    "let the operators @xmath14 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 be given , with structure described by formulas , , - above .",
