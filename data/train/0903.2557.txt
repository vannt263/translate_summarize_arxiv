    "synchrotron and synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) are common radiation processes in astrophysical environments where relativistic electrons are continuously injected into a magnetized plasma . in the thomson scattering regime , the ssc component dominates the energy output whenever the local energy density of the synchrotron photons is larger than the energy density of the local magnetic field , as well as the energy density of any external radiation field .",
    "in such a case , synchrotron photons that are upscattered once by the synchrotron emitting electrons carry more energy than the unscattered synchrotron photons .",
    "the typical frequency of the upscattered photons is increased by a factor of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the typical electron lorentz factor .",
    "photons that are upscattered twice carry more energy than those that are scattered once and there typical frequency is again multiplied by @xmath2 .",
    "this hierarchical spectral structure , where the total photons energy increases with the number of scattering and the frequency of each generation is shifted by @xmath4 , continues up to the point where the energy of the upscattered photons get to the klein - nishina ( kn ) limit .",
    "namely , the individual photon energy , as measured in the rest frame of the upscattering electron , becomes comparable to the electron rest - mass energy , @xmath5 . at this point",
    "there is a transition of the scattering cross - section from the constant thomson regime to the klein - nishina regime , where it is inversely proportional to the photons frequency .",
    "in addition , the photon energy gain at each scattering ( frequency shift ) , which is proportional to the pre - scattering photon energy in the thomson regime , becomes constant ( roughly @xmath6 ) above the kn limit .",
    "the cross - section fall - off and the saturation of the energy transfer at each scattering , terminate the hierarchical spectral structure above the kn limit .",
    "the direct effect of the kn limit on the observed spectrum is the suppression of high - energy upscattered photons .",
    "however an indirect effect is present in case that ssc emission dominates the energy output , and that at least some of the injected electrons have enough time to cool .",
    "in such a case electrons with different energies ( lorentz factors ) are cooling on a different fraction of the radiation field .",
    "the reason is that some of the photons that are below the kn limit for less energetic electrons are above this limit for more energetic electrons . as a result ,",
    "the energy distribution of the cooling electrons is modified by the kn limit , and so does the synchrotron spectrum as well as the spectra of all the ssc hierarchical branches .",
    "while this indirect effect is less dramatic than the high - energy kn cutoff , it may be the only observed kn effect in cases that the high - energy ssc branches are above the detectors energy range , thereby providing a valuable information about the physical properties of the source .",
    "moreover , the kn modified synchrotron spectrum may be significantly different than the unmodified one , making it necessary to include kn effects even in cases where just the synchrotron spectrum is analyzed .    in relativistic sources , such as active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs )",
    ", it is thought that optically thin synchrotron and ssc emission is produced behind relativistic shocks , where a fresh population of relativistic electrons is injected .",
    "analytic approximation of the synchrotron - ssc spectra in such systems is rather complex even when the kn feedback on the electron distribution are not fully accounted for ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite derived the set of equations which self - consistently follow the electron distribution for a one zone synchrotron - ssc model ( when pair - production can be ignored ) and solved them numerically for several examples in the context of radio sources .",
    "numerical calculations for different sources ( e.g. , gev agns and grbs ) , and with additional physics ( e.g. , time dependent photon field and pair production ) followed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , useful analytic approximations of the optically thin synchrotron - ssc spectra in cases that kn effects are important , were only partially discussed for a few special cases@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide an analytic approximation of the optically thin synchrotron and ssc spectra in cases where kn feedback plays an important role and can not be ignored , while pairs production can be ignored .",
    "we consider a relativistic blast wave that injects electrons with a power - law energy distribution and provide a comprehensive analytic approximate description of the resulting spectra as a function of the importance of the kn suppression and the relative cooling by synchrotron and ssc .",
    "we provide an analytic formula for the ssc to synchrotron energy output ratio as a function of the physical parameters .",
    "these approximations are useful as guidelines of the expected range of possible optically thin synchrotron - ssc spectra and as a tool for interpretation of observation without carrying out elaborate numerical calculations .",
    "the limitation of the analytic approach is that it provides a sharp broken power - law spectra , while the true spectra are quite smooth . since kn effects on the electron spectrum are resulting from integration over the electron spectrum itself ( see eq .",
    "[ eq ynumeric ] ) , the synchrotron power - law - breaks that are associated with kn effects are smoother than those that are not .",
    "nevertheless , the approximated analytic spectra provided here are by far more accurate than calculations ( numerical or analytic ) that neglect kn effects on the electron spectrum .",
    "we caution that these calculations apply only when the source is optically thin and pair production can be neglected .",
    "this is not a trivial demand , since photons that are upscattered near the kn limit are energetic enough to produce pairs with the seed photons .",
    "thus , pair production can be neglected only when the source is optically thin not only to thomson scattering on electrons / pairs but also to pair creation by energetic photons on the seed photons . while the later condition is more stringent ( since seed photons are more numerous than optically thin electrons / pairs ) , it is still applicable to many astrophysical sources .",
    "our results show that since lower - energy electrons are cooling more efficiently by ssc emission , kn effects result in harder spectra of electrons that are cooling fast ( i.e. , radiating most of their energy over the system lifetime ) .",
    "we show that in case that electrons are continuously injected with some minimal lorentz factor @xmath7 and all the electrons are cooling fast , the spectrum of the synchrotron flux at frequencies that are below @xmath8 can be , in extreme cases , as hard as @xmath9 ( compared to the typical @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the synchrotron frequency ) .",
    "we also show that the spectrum at @xmath12 can be hard enough so most of the synchrotron energy is emitted at @xmath12 even if most of the injected electron energy is in electrons with lorentz factor of the order of @xmath7 which are cooling fast .",
    "another kn effect is that the transition from electrons that are cooling fast by synchrotron emission to electrons that are cooling fast by ssc emission can result in a dramatic observational signature where the observed spectral break that corresponds to the cooling lorentz factor ( above which electrons are cooling fast )  jumps \" by orders of magnitude within a short time .",
    "kn effects increase the complexity of the observed spectra and the number of different types of spectra . in the paper we separate the observed spectra to six different types , which covers the most relevant possibilities , each corresponding to different physical conditions in the source . for convenience , table [ table physical cond ]",
    "summarizes the observed spectral types that correspond each to a given physical system and gives the references to the equations that are relevant to each case .",
    "tables [ table critical gammas]-[table ssc plss ] list the values of the break frequencies and of the spectral power - law indices for each of the different cases . a reader that is interested only in the specific spectrum of a given physical system",
    "can start the search in table [ table physical cond ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec spectra guidelines ] we describe the physical model and present guidelines of the general considerations that we use to derive the synchrotron - ssc analytic spectra in the different cases .",
    "spectra of systems where all the electrons are cooling fast are derived in  [ sec fastcooling ] and spectra of systems where most of the energy is in electrons that cool",
    "slowly are presented in ",
    "[ sec slowcooling ] . the exact definition and value of the cooling frequency , as well as its effects on the observed spectrum ,",
    "are discussed in  [ sec g_c ] .",
    "we demonstrate the application of our results to theory by applying them to prompt and afterglow emission models of grbs in ",
    "[ sec grbs ] .",
    "the main results are summarized in  [ sec summary ] .",
    "we consider a one - zone model where relativistic electrons radiate synchrotron emission and where the inverse - compton emission of these electrons is dominated by upscattering their own emitted synchrotron photons . the electron population in the source is generated by a continuous injection of relativistic electrons with a power - law distribution , i.e. , @xmath13 for @xmath14 ( @xmath15 otherwise ) where @xmath16 is the electron source function",
    ", @xmath3 is the electron lorentz factor and @xmath17 .",
    "we consider only radiative cooling and define @xmath18 as the lorentz factor above which electrons are cooled efficiently over the age of the system",
    ". may be more complicated in a small region of the parameter space .",
    "we discuss the definition ( and value ) of @xmath18 in  [ sec g_c ] . ]",
    "the source is optically thin to photons emitted at the typical synchrotron frequency so self - absorbtion can be ignored .",
    "the source is also optically thin for pair production by an arbitrarily energetic photon on the synchrotron photons so pair production can be neglected .",
    "we also neglect short time scale variability of the photon field in the sense that we work in the regime where the photon field is determined by the instantaneous electron distribution .",
    "finally , cosmological redshift effects are neglected in this study .",
    "these can be easily added to the results according to the usual prescription .",
    "the scenario of interest here is the one where the energy density of synchrotron photons in the source is larger than the magnetic field energy density , since only in this regime the electrons distribution depends on kn effects as the cooling of some of the electrons is dominated by ssc while others are cooled predominantly by synchrotron radiation .",
    "therefore throughout the paper we assume the synchrotron energy density dominates over the magnetic field energy density , with the exception of  [ sec dominantsynch fast ] and  [ sec dominantsynch slow ] where , for completeness , we briefly discuss the ssc spectra when synchrotron radiation dominates the cooling of all electrons .",
    "finally we discuss here in detail only the case where the kn limit is relevant for the synchrotron photons , implying that multiple scattering are strongly suppressed and only single scattering ssc is important .",
    "the case where there are multiple ssc generations is not discussed here but it shows similar effects and similar values of the asymptotic power - law indices to those of the single generation case .",
    "the self - consistent electron distribution and the observed spectra can be easily computed once we know the synchrotron to ssc emissivity ratio as a function of the electron lorentz factor : @xmath19 when kn effects are neglected @xmath20 is constant and we first rederive its value ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the scenario that we have in mind is an emission from a plasma that is heated by a relativistic shock where relativistic electrons are injected at the shock front and carry a fraction @xmath21 out of the injected internal energy .",
    "the fraction of the magnetic field energy out of the internal energy in the shocked plasma is @xmath22 . in this case @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the energy density of synchrotron photons and magnetic field respectively and @xmath26 is the fraction of electrons energy that was emitted .",
    "therefore : @xmath27 when relating @xmath28 to @xmath29 we assume that the volume occupied by the shocked plasma , @xmath30 , is comparable to the volumed occupied by synchrotron radiation , @xmath31 .",
    "this is true for the relativistic shocks considered here but is not necessarily correct in the general case . in case",
    "that @xmath32 then eq . [ eq ynokn ] is generalized by multiplying the right hand side by the fraction of the photon energy that is contained within @xmath30 . in case of a non - relativistic blast wave with velocity @xmath33",
    "this fraction is roughly @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "this is the only generalization needed in order to apply the results of this paper to cases where @xmath32 .",
    "the line of reasoning used to derive eq .",
    "[ eq ynokn ] can be used to show that in general when electrons with lorentz factor @xmath3 are fast cooling by upscattering their own synchrotron photons then @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the fraction of energy injected in electrons with lorentz factor @xmath37 .    in order to understand the effects of the kn limit it is useful to define the following function of an electron lorentz factor : @xmath38 and its reciprocal function : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the electron mass , @xmath41 is the light speed ,",
    "@xmath42 is planck s constant , @xmath43 is the bulk lorentz factor of the source ( assuming the source is moving towards the observer ) and @xmath44 is the typical observed frequency of the synchrotron emission of an electron with lorentz factor @xmath3 ( @xmath45 is the magnetic field and @xmath46 is the electron charge ) .",
    "these functions are useful since synchrotron photons emitted by electrons with lorentz factor larger than @xmath3 ( i.e. , with frequency @xmath47 ) can not be upscattered efficiently by electrons with lorentz factor larger than @xmath48 because they are above the kn limit .",
    "similarly , electrons with lorentz factor @xmath3 can not efficiently upscatter synchrotron photons emitted by electrons with lorentz factor larger than @xmath49 .",

    "the numerator in the integral over @xmath81 gives the rate at which photons with a frequency @xmath84 and incident angle @xmath81 are upscattered , normalized to the rate in the thomson scattering regime .",
    "the factor @xmath85 is approximately the energy given to each upscattered photon , again normalized to the energy given in the thomson regime , where in the thomson regime ( @xmath86 ) photons gain energy that is proportional to their initial frequency , while in the klein - nishina regime ( @xmath87 ) photons gain roughly a constant amount of energy ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "therefore in the thomson regime the integral over @xmath81 gives @xmath89 while at the klein - nishina regime it is @xmath90 ( neglecting logarithmic terms ; note that @xmath91 \\propto \\ln(2x)/x$ ] ) .",

    "first , a spectrum of the fast cooling regime can asymptotically be as hard as @xmath549 .",
    "such a power - law segment is observed when the electrons which are radiating the synchrotron photons within this power - law segment are cooled down predominantly by upscattering synchrotron photons within this power - law segment itself ( cases iib and iic ) .",
    "this flat spectrum is significantly different than any of the predictions of a standard synchrotron theory that ignore kn effects , as standard theory predicts spectral indices that are harder than @xmath550 or softer than @xmath242 .",
    "note that the actual spectrum in this specific segment is significantly smoother than the analytic approximation . as a result @xmath551 in this power - law segment may approach the asymptotic value @xmath552 only for very large values of @xmath206 . for example , numerical solution of equations [ eq cool func ] , [ eq dn_dt ] and [ eq ynumeric ] shows that if @xmath553 the @xmath551 value in this segment can not exceed @xmath554 while if @xmath354 it can not exceed @xmath555 .",
    "second , @xmath556 is typically an available observable even when the spectral resolution is limited , and standard theory associates it with @xmath154 in the fast cooling regime and @xmath163 in the slow cooling regime .",
    "kn effects can modify this interpretation as the suppressed cooling of higher energy electrons may results in @xmath557 .",
    "the ssc spectrum is also modified by kn limit .",
    "the most observable signature of kn effects in the ssc spectrum is the `` kn cut - off , '' which is actually not a sharp cut - off but a consecutive set of power - law segments that become steeper at higher frequencies .",

    "therefore emission at @xmath559 that is affected by the kn limit is dominated by electrons with @xmath435[@xmath408 ] in the fast[slow ] cooling regime .",
    "if these electrons are still cooling predominantly by ssc emission ( i.e. , their @xmath428 ) then the first kn break at @xmath559 is to a very mild spectral index , @xmath325 , and if @xmath561 it is hardly distinguishable from the @xmath531 spectral index expected in case that kn effects are unimportant .",
    "a clear steepening in the light curve can be observed only once the lorentz factor of the upscattering electron is @xmath178 [ @xmath562 in the fast [ slow ] cooling regime . at this point",
    "the ssc spectral index depends on the synchrotron spectral index of the upscttered photons ( at @xmath164 ) and it ranges between @xmath246 to @xmath249 .",
    "the value of @xmath563 is also affected by the kn cross section when @xmath564 [ @xmath535 ] in the fast [ slow ] cooling regime . in these cases @xmath566 [ @xmath567 instead of the standard value ( @xmath568 [ @xmath569 ) .",
    "the kn cross - section can also affect the value of @xmath163 and in some cases can result in a unique temporal evolution@xmath163 can  jump \" by orders of magnitude over a short time scale .",
    "when kn effects are ignored the cooling rate of an electron always increases with its energy .",
    "the kn modified ssc cooling can revise this property introducing similar cooling rates for high - energy electrons that cool by synchrotron emission and much lower energy electrons that cool by ssc emission , where the cooling rate of intermediate energy electrons is much lower .",
    "when the similar cooling time of the high - energy electrons and low - energy electrons in such configuration becomes comparable to the system lifetime , @xmath63 there is a sudden change of the observed @xmath163 between the frequency that corresponds to high - energy synchrotron cooling electrons ( @xmath440 ) and the frequency that corresponds to low - energy ssc cooling electrons ( @xmath441 ) .",

    "we find that signature of kn effects may have already been observed in the prompt emission of some grbs , in the form of spectrum that is harder than the standard synchrotron model both above and below @xmath556 .",
    "we examine also the application of the kn limit to the external shock model ( in its quasi - spherical regime ) of grb afterglow emission . here",
    "we find that in the slow cooling phase , assuming canonical parameters : ( a ) @xmath169 may be observed passing through the x - ray ( b ) the value of @xmath163 may be significantly modified by the kn limit ( c ) the ssc gev energy output is unlikely to be suppressed by the kn cross - section when the radio - x - ray afterglow is luminous , but it may be strongly suppressed when the radio - x - ray afterglow is faint . finally we find that this afterglow model does not predict a large ssc - to - synchrotron luminosity ratio even in case that the poorly constrained model parameter @xmath532 is very small .",
