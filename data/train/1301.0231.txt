    "coupled map lattices ( cmls ) @xcite have long become a useful tool to investigate spatiotemporal behavior of extended and possibly chaotic dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "it is so even though the most standard cml , that based on the coupling of logistic maps , is physically not particularly appealing as it is fairly remote from any model of natural phenomena .",
    "other , more complicated cmls , have found interesting applications in physical modeling .",
    "one should mention here cmls developed to describe the rayleigh - benard convection @xcite , dynamics of boiling @xcite , formation and dynamics of clouds @xcite , crystal growth processes and hydrodynamics of two - dimensional flows @xcite .",
    "the most important characteristic quantities employed to study various types of cmls include co - moving lyapunov spectra , mutual information flow , spatiotemporal power spectra , kolmogorov - sinai entropy density , pattern entropy @xcite .",
    "more recently , the detrended fluctuation analysis , structure function analysis , local dimensions , embedding dimension and recurrence analysis have also been introduced for cmls @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyze the interesting features of the above - mentioned most standard coupled map lattices which resemble the characteristisc of the condensates of bose particles as well as those associated with formation of patterns in two spatial dimensions . in particular , we investigate the formation of such patterns for relatively short times ; their dependence on two parameters which define cml as well as the initial conditions is found numerically .",
    "thus , the present work is very much in the spirit of classical papers @xcite .",
    "we believe , however , that the subject is very far from being exhausted as it is quite easy to find interesting patterns not discovered in the above works .",
    "more importantly , we combine searching for interesting patterns with the introduction of three additional quantities with the help of which one can characterize the dynamics and statistical properties of cmls .",
    "these are the reduced density matrix , the reduced wave function , and a quantity which is an analog of the number of particle .",
    "this is motivated , in part , by what we feel is the need to slightly deemphasize the connection of cmls with finite - dimensional dynamical systems , and make their analysis similar to that of classical field theory , especially the gross - pitaevskii equation which is used in the physics of bose - einstein condensation @xcite .",
    "application of the classical field - theoretical methods in the physics of condensates have been described , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "many interesting patterns emerge in the system while it still exhibits a transient behavior as can be seen , e.g. , in the plots of the  number of particles \" .",
    "we have not attempted here to reach the regime of stationary dynamics in each case .",
    "the problem for which times such a stationary regime becomes established is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we are content with the transient regime as long as something interesting about the connection with condensates and about the patterns can be observed .",
    "let us notice that remarkable results on the transient behavior of extended systems with chaotic behavior have been obtained , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "in addition , we observe that the condensate - like behavior has been reported in other systems which are not connected with many bose particles .",
    "of particular interest are the developments in the theory of complex networks @xcite . here , however , we explore the condensate - like behavior in the coupled map lattices .    the main body of this work is organized as follows .",
    "the mathematical model as well as the basic definitions of reduced density matrix and reduced wave function are introduced in section 2 .",
    "section 3 provides a justification of our claim that the coupled map lattices based on logistic map exhibit properties which are analogous to those of the bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) . the description of numerical results concerning pattern formation are contained in section 4 , while section 5 comprises a few concluding remarks .",
    "let us consider the classical field @xmath0 defined on a two - dimensional spatial lattice .",
    "its evolution in ( dimensionless , discrete ) time @xmath1 is given by the following equation :    @xmath2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the function @xmath3 is given by :    @xmath4    and the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 are constant .",
    "the set of values taken by @xmath7 is the interval @xmath8 $ ] . from the physical point of view",
    "the above diffusive model is rather bizarre , containing a field - dependent diffusion .",
    "there is no conserved quantity here which could play the role of energy or the number of excitations .    in the following the coefficient @xmath6",
    "will be called the  diffusion constant \" , and the coefficient @xmath5 - the  non - linear parameter \" .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath7 satisfies either the periodic boundary or dirichlet ( with @xmath9 ) conditions on the borders of simulation box .",
    "the size of that box is @xmath10 .",
    "all our simulations have been performed with @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath12 be the two - dimensional discrete fourier transform of @xmath7 ,    @xmath13    thus , @xmath12 may be interpreted as the momentum representation of the field @xmath7 .    below we investigate the relation between a cml described by eq.(1 ) and a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "therefore , let us invoke the basic characteristics of the latter which are so important that they actually form a part of its modern definition .",
    "these are @xcite :    1 .   the presence of off - diagonal long - range order ( odlro ) .",
    "2 .   the presence of one eigenvalue of the one - particle reduced density matrix which is much larger than all other eigenvalues .    let us notice that the property 2",
    ". corresponds to the well - known intuitive definition of the bose - einstein condensate .",
    "namely , taking into account that the one - particle reduced density matrix @xmath14 has the following decomposition in terms of eigenvalues @xmath15 and eigenvectors @xmath16 :    @xmath17    we realize that if one of the eigenvalues is much larger than the rest , then the majority or at least a substantial fraction of particles is in the same single - particle quantum state .    in addition , for an idealized system of bose particles with periodic boundary conditions and without external potential , the following signature of condensation is also to be noticed :    1 .",
    "the population of the zero - momentum mode is much larger than population of all other modes .",
    "the properties 1 . and 2 .",
    "acquire quantitative meaning only if the one - particle reduced density matrix is defined .",
    "however , as our model is purely classical , the definition of that density matrix is not self - evident . here",
    "we make use of the classical - field approach to the theory of bose - einstein condensation @xcite and define the quantities : @xmath18    and    @xmath19    we shall call the quantity @xmath20 the reduced density matrix of cml .",
    "the above definition in terms of an averaged quadratic form made of @xmath7 seems quite natural , especially because @xmath21 is a real symmetric , positive - definite matrix with the trace equal to @xmath22 .",
    "the sharp brackets @xmath23 denote the time averaging :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the total simulation time and @xmath26 is the averaging time . in our numerical experiments @xmath25 has been equal to 3000 , and @xmath26 has been chosen to be equal to 300",
    ".    we can provide the quantitative meaning to the concept of off - diagonal long - range order ( odlro ) by saying that it is present in the system if    @xmath27    does not go to zero with increasing @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , the system possesses the basic property 1 . of bose - einstein condensates .",
    "let @xmath29 be the largest eigenvalue of @xmath21 .",
    "we will say that cml is in a `` condensed state '' if @xmath29 is significantly larger that all other eigenvalues of @xmath21 .",
    "if this is the case , the system possesses property 2 .",
    "of the bose - einstein condensates .",
    "the corresponding eigenvector , @xmath30 , will be called the reduced wave function of the ( condensed part of ) coupled map lattice .    one thing which still requires explanation is that the above definition of the reduced density matrix involves not only temporal , but also spatial averaging over @xmath31 .",
    "this is performed just for technical convenience , namely , to avoid dealing with too large matrices .",
    "strictly speaking , we are allowed to assess the presence or absence of odlro only in one ( @xmath28 ) direction .",
    "but that direction is arbitrary , as we might equally well consider averaging over @xmath28 without any qualitative change in the results .    in the classical field theory the quantity @xmath32 represents the particle density in momentum space",
    "; in the corresponding quantum theory , upon the raising of @xmath7 , @xmath33 to the status of operators , @xmath32 would be called the particle number operator .",
    "analogously , we introduce the number @xmath34 which - just for the purpose of the present article - will be called the  particle number \" , and is defined as :    @xmath35    all the above definitions are modeled after the corresponding definitions in the non - relativistic classical field theory .",
    "we have performed our numerical experiment with six values of the non - linear parameter @xmath5 ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) , twenty five values of the diffusion constant @xmath6 ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) , five different initial conditions , and two different boundary conditions .",
    "the boundary conditions have been chosen either as periodic or",
    " dirichlet \" ones , the latter with @xmath9 at all boundaries . to save some space ,",
    "the tables below contain the results for @xmath6 being multiples of @xmath40 , but the results for other @xmath6 do not differ qualitatively from those reported below .",
    "the following initial conditions have been investigated .",
    "the first - type ( a ) - initial conditions are such that @xmath0 is  excited \" only at a single point at @xmath41 : @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is equal to zero at all other @xmath44 . type ( b ) initial conditions are such that @xmath0 has initially two non - vanishing values : @xmath45 . by type ( c ) initial conditions we mean those with @xmath43 being a gaussian function , @xmath46 . in type",
    "( d ) initial conditions the gaussian has been replaced with a sine function , @xmath47 , and type ( e ) are characterized by @xmath43 being equal to @xmath48 at all internal points except of one point - @xmath49 - where @xmath7 is equal to @xmath50 .",
    "tables 1 - 5 show the dependence of the largest eigenvalue of the time - averaged reduced density matrix on @xmath5 and @xmath6 :    .largest eigenvalue of the reduced density matrix .",
    "periodic boundary conditions and type ( a ) initial conditions [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the most important conclusion one can draw from the tables ( 1 - 5 ) is the same as in the case of periodic boundary conditions : there exist one dominant eigenvalues for almost values parameters except of the value @xmath51 where exactly two dominant eigenvalues are present .",
    "this feature suggests that the change of boundary conditions does not diminish the similarity of our system to the bose - einstein condensates , or quasi - condensates .",
    "also , it seems that the general trend of change ( namely , decrease ) of the largest eigenvalue with growing @xmath5 for given @xmath6 is here observed , but again , the number of exceptions is considerable .    in figure 5",
    "we have displayed the spatial dependence of the quantity ( `` one - particle correlation function '' ) @xmath52 for @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , periodic boundary conditions , and five types of initial conditions .",
    "as in the case of periodic boundary conditions , the long - range order is very transparent .",
    "the function @xmath56 approaches zero only for the values of its arguments approaching boundaries .    ,",
    "@xmath55 and dirichlet boundary conditions ; ( a ) solid line : type ( a ) initial conditions , dashed line : type ( b ) initial conditions ; ( b ) solid line : type ( c ) initial conditions , dashed line : type ( d ) boundary conditions , dotted line : type ( e ) initial conditions.,width=415,height=491 ]    figure 6(a - c ) contains the plots of the eigenvectors ( `` wave functions of the condensate '' ) corresponding to the largest eigenvalue @xmath29 for all types of initial conditions .     and",

    "the system appears to be globally correlated , even though it is still in the transient regime with only local synchronization .",
    "as in the previous section , we have checked the behavior of the field @xmath7 in momentum space . in figures 7(a - e ) the plots of the moduli @xmath57 as functions of two components of their `` momentum '' argument are shown for two types of initial conditions .",
    "the function @xmath58 is normalized in such a way that its maximal value is @xmath22 .     on the discrete vector of momentum @xmath59 for @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "the values of @xmath57 has been normalized in such a way that @xmath60 ; ( a ) type ( a ) initial conditions ; ( b ) type ( b ) initial condition ; ( c ) type ( c ) initial conditions ; ( d ) type ( d ) initial conditions ; ( e ) type ( e ) initial conditions.,width=415,height=566 ]    the dominance of a single @xmath61 mode is transparent , except that in the case the type ( d ) ( sinusoidal ) initial conditions the population of lateral modes is substantially bigger that in the other cases .",
    "figure 8(a - e ) contains the plots of time dependence of the variable @xmath34 for @xmath62 and @xmath55 .     for @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and dirichlet boundary conditions ; ( a ) type ( a ) initial conditions , ( b ) type ( b ) initial conditions , ( c ) type ( c ) initial conditions , ( d ) type ( d ) initial conditions , ( e ) type ( e ) initial conditions.,width=415,height=491 ]    it seems that the dynamics of the particle is quite sensitive to the boundary conditions for we can see here substantial deviation from the dynamics of @xmath34 in the case of periodic boundary conditions .",
    "in particular , in the time regime which is investigated here , the  bands \" appear to be far better visible for the dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "what is more , the case of sinusoidal initial conditions is no longer much different from all the others , although the mean number of particles is still smallest in that case .",
    "we have observed the following general rules in the process of pattern formation in our system .",
    "firstly , the patterns are incomparably better developed ( much better visible ) for any  structured \" initial conditions ( like those considered in this work ) than in the case of random initial conditions . the initial inhomogeneities ( or  seeds \" ) serve the building of large structures much better than fully random conditions , which is fairly intuitive .",
    "the patterns are best developed for smaller values of the non - linear parameter and intermediate values of the diffusion constant .    in figs .",
