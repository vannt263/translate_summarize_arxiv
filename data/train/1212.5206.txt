    "is a blazar at redshift @xmath4 that exhibits nearly periodic double peaked outbursts at intervals of approximately 12 years in the optical regime @xcite .",
    "this periodicity is not exact , as was definitely demonstrated by the observed outbursts in 2005 and 2007 @xcite .",
    "both the double peaked structure and the dwell in the outburst interval have been successfully explained by a precessing binary black hole model @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the double optical outbursts are caused by a secondary black hole impacting the accretion disk of the primary black hole , twice in one period .",
    "the orbit of the secondary is sufficiently compact and eccentric ( @xmath5 ) to bring it close enough to the primary for strong relativistic precession of the orbit @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the precession has been established at approximately @xmath6 per cycle @xcite .",
    "the binary black hole with orbital speeds close to @xmath7 of the light speed enabled probing the conservative aspects of general relativistic binary dynamics at the second post - newtonian order , including the effects of dominant order spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "further , the possibility of testing in the near future general relativity and black hole properties using the binary black hole in oj 287 makes the detailed understanding of various observational features of the blazar especially important @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss an aspect of oj 287 binary black hole which has attracted rather little attention so far .",
    "the repeated impacts of the secondary black hole on the accretion disk of the primary create a corona of high velocity gas clouds above the standard geometrically thin but optically thick accretion disk .",
    "as the secondary travels through this disk , it may accrete some of the clouds , and these accretion events may lead to quite prominent brightening of the oj 287 system as whole .",
    "they could be contrasted with similarly fast brightening events of black holes accreting whole stars , as has been recently reported @xcite , but with a different timescale and mechanism of action .",
    "if such events can be identified , they would allow the detection of the secondary black hole , in addition to the primary which is normally responsible for the emission of oj 287 .",
    "the type of light curve features we will discuss are shown in figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] which displays the optical light curve of oj 287 since 1990 . besides the double peak structure , indicated by the vertical lines , there are prominent outbursts prior to each cycle called _ precursors _ by @xcite .",
    "they are marked by arrows in figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] .",
    "the first one peaked at @xmath8 and it was studied by @xcite .",
    "the second one peaking at @xmath9 was studied by @xcite .",
    "they also discussed a possible origin of the precursors .",
    "the third precursor occurred only recently , peaking at @xmath10 , and the data related to this precursor are reported here .",
    "we will also describe two possible scenarios with regard to the origin of precursors and finally settle on a model that seems to fit the limited amount of data .",
    "in addition to the previously published light curve @xcite , we have added new datapoints up to the most recent precursor flare .",
    "these observations have been made at tuorla observatory in finland ( hereafter labelled tuo ) , astronomical observatory of capannori in italy ( oac ) , astronomical observatory of the jagiellonian university ( krk ) and the mt .",
    "suhora observatory of the pedagogical university ( suh ) in poland , university of athens ( ath ) in greece , mt .",
    "cuba observatory ( mtc ) in usa , mt . abu infrared observatory ( miro ) in india and liverpool telescope ( liv ) and kungliga vetenskapliga akademien telescope ( kva ) situated at observatorio del roque de los muchachos in la palma , canary islands , spain .",
    "the new measurements are catalogued in table  [ tb : observations ] .",
    "they have been carried out in v , b and r bands , converted to v - magnitudes and then to v - band fluxes ( for details , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these light curve points are shown with greater resolution in the lowest panel of figure  [ fig : closeups ] .",
    "the timing of the peak flux is at @xmath10 .",
    "the two other panels of figure  [ fig : closeups ] display the corresponding times around earlier precursors at the same temporal resolution .",
    "we may note that typically there is more than one precursor peak .",
    "we will generally discuss the timing of the highest peak , but actual observed maximum height depends on how frequently the observations have been made .",
    "the precursors are very rapid phenomena in comparison with the standard double peak outbursts , and therefore the times of maxima may easily pass unobserved . a qualitative definition of a precursor flare can be given as intense flaring activity just before a scheduled major outburst , not exceeding it in brightness . to objectively classify the precursor peaks we note the following : the twin major outbursts typically rise @xmath11 or more in v - band brightness above the brightness in quiescent state .",
    "this quiescent brigtness level can be defined as the level under which the v - band brightness does nt fall , with measurement errors taken into account .",
    "this level has been rising gradually ; in 19901994 it was @xmath12 , in 20002005 @xmath13 and from 2010 onwards @xmath14 . for the precursors",
    ", we then have a defining limit of a rise of @xmath15 or more in v - band compared to quiescent level .",
    "we note that objective classification of precursor flares is not entirely straightforward , as oj 287 exhibits natural flaring activity induced by the tidal action on the primary accretion by the close passes of the secondary . for the following discussion it is not important which choice of the precursor peak matching the criterion we make .",

    "those in the b band were included in this paper .",
    "we have calculated the position of the secondary black hole relative to the primary at the times of the precursor flares , using a post - newtonian integration scheme of order 3 , with binary orbital parameters derived from @xcite .",
    "speficifally , binary semimajor axis was @xmath23 , eccentricity @xmath24 and initial precession angle at apocentre @xmath25 at epoch @xmath26 .",
    "the results shown in figure  [ fig : orbit_bursts ] indicate that the precursor bursts seem to occur when the secondary is at a constant height of @xmath27 above the @xmath28 plane of the accretion disk of the primary .",
    "thus we have to consider what mechanism would initiate outbursts at this particular orbital phase .",
    "let us first consider outbursts arising in the primary .",
    "they could be initiated by perturbations in the accretion disk ; these perturbations propagate to the jet and initiate optical outbursts with about three months time delay @xcite , a reasonable time interval in a strongly magnetic disk .",
    "such perturbations should start when the tidal perturbation of the secondary on the accretion disk reaches some critical level .    to study this",
    ", we have calculated the ratio of the vertical tidal force @xmath29 , caused by the secondary on an element of the accretion disk immediatelly below it , to the horizontal tidal force @xmath30 caused by the primary on the same disk element .",
    "the tidal force is proportional to the mass of the black hole and the cube of the distance from it , and the ratio of the forces is thus @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the black hole masses , @xmath33 is the distance from the primary in the plane its accretion disk , and @xmath0 is the vertical distance of the secondary from the plane of the disk",
    ". the tidal ratio ( multiplied by 10 ) has been plotted as a solid line in the three panels of figure  [ fig : closeups ] .",
    "we see that the tidal line describes well the general rise of the activity level in oj 287 , and thus supports the view that this background activity does arise from the primary black hole with its associated disk and jet . however , there is no single threshold level where the precursors start to arise .",
    "thus this explanation does not seem to work for the origin of precursors .",
    "it is possible that the tidal process is more complicated than our simple tidal ratio estimate .",
    "we will carry out a full tidal perturbation calculation in the next section to check this preliminary conclusion .",
    "the second possibility is that the source of the precursor peak is the secondary black hole . in this scenario",
    "the secondary meets a layer of gas clouds at a constant height above the disk , accretes these clouds in individual accretion events , and this produces brightness spikes . to study this scenario ,",
    "we have plotted the height of the secondary above the accretion disk as a function of time in the three panels of figure  [ fig : closeups ] ( dashed line ) .",
    "the height is measured in units of @xmath34 ( and multiplied by @xmath35 in the display ) .",
    "we see that the constant height is a good predictor for the start of the precursor events , as is also shown by figure  [ fig : orbit_bursts ] .",
    "this result leads us to consider a model where the precursor flares arise in the secondary black hole when it plunges into a gas cloud in the corona of the primary accretion disk .",
    "a natural origin for these clouds are the gas clouds pulled off by the secondary from the accretion disk of the primary during previous orbital revolutions .",
    "if the secondary impacts these clouds , some of the gas may be accreted by the secondary , with subsequent brightening of its jet .",
    "we may assume the secondary black hole to be maximally spinning , i.e. with kerr parameter @xmath36 and with a mass of @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "this @xmath38 value is supported by the observed 228 minute periodicity @xcite which is the period of innermost stable orbit for a black hole of this mass and spin .",
    "it is also reasonable that the secondary has close to maximum spin as it crosses the primary disk twice in 12 years and every time accretes matter with the same direction of the specific angular momentum , the spin direction of the accretion disk .",
    "the spin of the primary has already been established at @xmath39 and its mass at @xmath40 @xcite . with these values the relative electromagnetic brightness of the secondary versus the primary jet at the times of the outbursts may be rather equal for comparable mass accretion rates @xcite .",
    "looking at the next time the secondary orbit descends to the height of @xmath41 we can predict the timing of the next precursor flare .",
    "the mean value and one sigma limits for @xmath41 give @xmath42 . from this",
    "we find the timing of the next expected precursor burst with one sigma limits to be approximately @xmath43 .",
    "this prediction leaves an ample interval for observation before the next expected major outburst in @xmath3 .",
    "to simulate the dynamics of the oj 287 system , we have developed a multiprocessor n - body solver along the lines of @xcite , but with some significant improvements .",
    "the primary improvement is the simultaneous evolution of black hole binary orbits and accretion disk particles around the primary black hole , including interactions between the accretion disk particles themselves .",
    "the accretion disk is modeled as a cloud of point - like particles initialized with a standard vertical @xmath44 distribution , where @xmath45 is the vertical scale height .",
    "the point particles interact gravitationally with both black holes in the binary and with each other through a grid - based viscosity calculation .    for the disk viscosity calculation",
    "we use a radially nonuniform polar grid adapted from @xcite . in this scheme",
    "we define the grid by coordinates @xmath46 and @xmath47 such that    @xmath48    the parameter @xmath49 defines the maximum radial extent of the grid .",
    "parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 then define the number of radial and azimuthal divisions when    @xmath52    the benefit of this formulation is that the grid cells are approximately square through the entire radial extent of the grid .    the disk viscosity is calculated in the vertical and radial directions only , using the physical model of @xcite .",
    "the kinematic viscosity coefficient @xmath53 of the disk gas as a function of the radial distance is obtained from formula @xmath54 where @xmath33 is the radial distance , @xmath55 is the central black hole mass , @xmath56 is the particle density in the disk , and @xmath57 is the disk temperature . the last three are functions of @xmath33 and are obtained from the model in @xcite .",
    "for @xmath55 we use the primary black hole mass from @xcite .",
    "constant @xmath58 in a system of units defined by solar mass , julian year and the gravitational constant @xmath59 .",
    "the velocity components @xmath60 of each particle in a grid - cell are compared to the mean velocity components @xmath61 of all particles in the cell .",
    "the viscosity force per unit mass is then calculated from the component differences by the formula @xmath62 in which @xmath63 is the usual parameter in the @xmath63-disk theory @xcite and in its subsequent developments @xcite .    additionally , the solver uses post - newtonian approximation scheme to calculate the gravitational interaction of the black hole binary and the forces between the black holes and the accretion disk particles . in these numerical runs , binary dynamics",
    "is fully third post - newtonian order accurate and the required formulas may be found in @xcite .",
    "the model was used to calculate particle accretion counts to the primary and secondary black holes .",
    "the accretion radii were set to @xmath64 for the primary and @xmath65 for the secondary , where @xmath66 is the schwarzschild radius . as found out in @xcite ,",
    "changing the accretion radius only affects the scaling of the result , as long as the radius is at or above approximately @xmath64 .",
    "further , the number of particles escaping beyond @xmath67 vertically was counted , where @xmath68 , the standard deviation of the @xmath44 vertical distribution .",
    "these particles represent such escapes from the disk that end up in the primary or secondary jet as detailed in @xcite .",
    "the disk vertical scale height used in the simulations was chosen as @xmath69 and the inner and outer limits of the primary accretion disk were set to @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively .",
    "the accretion and escape counts since 1990 for the final run with @xmath72 particles and initial conditions from @xcite can be seen together with light curve data in figure  [ fig : data_vs_accre ] . the major flares and primary and secondary accretion line up well as expected from previous work @xcite .",
    "the precursor flare timings occur definitely too early in comparison with the particle flows displayed in figure  [ fig : data_vs_accre ] .",
    "this applies to the increases in vertical escapes of the particles from the primary disk ( lowest panel in figure  [ fig : data_vs_accre ] ) as well as to accretion flows to either of the black holes ( the two middle panels in figure  [ fig : data_vs_accre ] ) .",
    "to study the tidal effect of the primary on the secondary and the proposed coronal gas cloud impacts in more detail , we used the code to simulate the interaction between the secondary and a circumsecondary disk and a cloud of particles representing a coronal cloud .",
    "two representative simulations were chosen , with both using initial conditions from @xcite for the binary .",
    "for these simulations , the secondary accretion radius was set to @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "the interparticle gridded viscosity calculation was not used .    in the first",
    ", we simulated a disk surrounding the secondary to establish the tidal effect of the primary on the accretion rate of the secondary .",
    "the disk was simulated with @xmath75 particles positioned in a constant planar density disk in the @xmath76-plane .",
    "the radius of the disk was set to @xmath77 , comparable to the tidally stable radius of @xmath78 .",
    "this configuration was simulated for approximately two secondary periods .",
    "the resulting accretion rates are illustrated in figure  [ fig : sec_disk ] .",
    "the quiescent secondary accretion rate is greatly enhanced by the tidal action of the primary during the close pericenter passage . at this point ,",
    "most of the disk is disturbed and accreted by the secondary in a time scale of approximately @xmath79 .    in the second simulation",
    ", we used a spherical cloud of @xmath75 massive particles , set at @xmath80 with a keplerian rotation around the primary , positioned so that it collides with the secondary .",
    "the radius and total mass of the sphere were set to @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively , matching the theoretical predictions in the next section .",
    "figure  [ fig : sec_coll ] graphs the secondary accretion resulting from the collision .",
    "we find that the collision induces a brief peak in the secondary accretion rate , with a timescale of @xmath83 .",
    "this corresponds well with the theoretical prediction in the next section .",
    "the simplest explanation of the above results is that the secondary is impacting a thicker structure than the thin @xmath63-disk used in this simulation , and in much of the principal theoretical considerations and simulations concerning oj 287 , such as @xcite .",
    "a plausible additional structure is a geometrically thick but optically thin disk , such as the polish doughnut model @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the equipressure surfaces of the accretion disk can be obtained by solving @xmath84 where @xmath85 are the usual schwarzschild coordinates , @xmath86 are the components of the inverse of the metric and @xmath87 is the specific angular momentum of a fluid element .",
    "equation can be solved analytically for a schwarzschild metric if a constant angular momentum @xmath88 is assumed .",
    "the result is @xmath89}{l^2(1-r)},\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is in units of schwarzschild radii and @xmath90 is the integration constant enumerating the equipressure surfaces .",
    "figure  [ fig : equipressure ] shows a model fit of this equation to the model coordinates of the precursor flares .",
    "even though the fit describes a model with a nonrotating primary , the change in the equipressure surfaces for a rotating primary is not dramatic , as can be seen e.g. in @xcite .",
    "thus a reasonable possibility is a model with a cool , geometrically thin accretion disk with a hot , geometrically thick corona .",
    "additionally , the periodical impacts of the secondary tear off gas clouds from the accretion disk of the primary .",
    "thus the corona of the primary s accretion disk is expected to be partly composed of gas clouds , as in the model of @xcite .    in this model of precursor bursts",
    "we are observing a brightening of the secondary black hole , not the primary .",
    "how can the secondary of mass @xmath37 exceed the brightness of the primary of mass @xmath40 ?",
    "the key is the relative spin rate @xmath38 which is @xmath39 for the primary and , quite reasonably , as will be shown , @xmath36 for the secondary .",
    "the jet brightness of an accreting black hole with a jet is very sensitive to @xmath38 such that large @xmath38 systems are very much brighter than low @xmath38 systems of otherwise similar physical parameters .",
    "the jets of the two black holes would be aligned , as the jet direction is strongly influenced by the magnetic field of the primary accretion disk @xcite .",
    "thus both jets should have similar doppler boosting factors .",
    "we may additionally consider the secondary impact with a coronal gas cloud in more detail .",
    "from @xcite we find the initial volume of the gas clouds torn from the accretion disk of the primary by the secondary during impacts to be @xmath91 where @xmath74 is the schwarzschild radius of the secondary black hole , @xmath92 the primary accretion disk scale height and @xmath93 is a parameter of interaction , while @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the speed of light and the velocity of the secondary relative to the disc , respectively .",
    "the disk thickness is a function of the accretion rate @xmath96 of the primary black hole ( stella and rosner 1984 ) .",
    "this rate is not well known since the observed emission of oj 287 is jet - dominated , and the underlying disc - emission is not directly observed .",
    "based on the strength of the emission lines @xcite and the observed ( beamed ) luminosity of @xmath97 erg / s in the radio - uv range the value of disc luminosity may be @xmath98 erg / s @xcite which indicates @xmath99 .",
    "@xmath100 is the accretion rate of the primary that would give the eddington luminosity for it . in the following",
    "we will assume this accretion rate of the primary .",
    "further , @xmath101 lies approximately in the range of @xmath102 ; for the impacts we are discussing here @xmath103 . thus we may take @xmath104 . with @xmath105",
    "cm we may calculate @xmath106 , and assuming that the initial cloud is spherical , its radius is @xmath107 . in the disk model of @xcite with the scaling from @xcite , we get the surface mass density of @xmath108 .",
    "the exact value depends on the viscosity parameter @xmath109 which is not known .",
    "here we adopt @xmath110 which may not be unreasonable @xcite .",
    "after the initial impact , the cloud will expand by a factor of @xmath111 .",
    "when the secondary impacts this cloud again , the mass of the column interacting with the secondary may be approximated as @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the surface mass density of the gas cloud after it has fully expanded and has reached the pressure balance with the hot corona .",
    "we obtain @xmath114 .",
    "the secondary crosses the extent of the cloud in a timescale of @xmath115 .",
    "here the difficulty lies in obtaining an estimate for the expansion factor @xmath111 of the cloud .",
    "following @xcite we may estimate it to be at least @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the initial average optical depth of the cloud , for at this point the cloud turns optically thin and an outburst is observed .",
    "thereafter the optical light curve follows emission from an adiabatially expanding cloud ; thus @xmath118 at the time when the optical outburst is over .",
    "what happens thereafter is not known from observations , but it is possible that the cloud cools rapidly by radiation and may not expand very much again .",
    "we obtain the estimates    @xmath119    here @xmath120 is the eddington accretion rate of the secondary , assuming that the efficiency factor of the accretion process @xmath121 .",
    "this accretion rate gives the secondary the luminosity of @xmath122 .",
    "the timescale estimate is in agreement with the simulation result obtained in the previous section for @xmath123 .",
    "most of the accreted matter will end up in a disk , and will be transferred to the secondary black hole only slowly , in time which exceeds the orbital period by orders of magnitude .",
    "we would expect the immediate outburst only from matter which falls straight into the innermost disk of the secondary , say , within @xmath124 of the secondary black hole .",
    "this matter flow is only about @xmath125 of the flow calculated above , and thus we expect outbursts of roughly @xmath126 during the transit of the secondary through the gas cloud .",
    "the result scales with @xmath127 ; thus it could not be much smaller than our estimate but could possibly be bigger by a large factor , as @xmath109 values down to @xmath128 have been reported @xcite .",
    "thus , the secondary could possibly accrete close to the eddington rate @xmath129 , which would in turn indicate luminosity not so far from the eddington value of @xmath130 .    here",
    "we have assumed that the matter falling at or near the inner edge of the accretion disk is transferred to the secondary black hole and its jet in a timescale @xmath131",
    ". this would not be the case in the standard steady accretion process where the timescale is of the order of @xmath132 .",
    "however , it has been demonstrated that the accretion timescale is much faster than the standard steady rate when we are considering accretion of magnetic flux to the jet where the relevant timescale for matter falling near @xmath133 is of order @xmath134 orbital periods , or even less @xcite . for the secondary",
    "this is equivalent to a timescale of @xmath135 days .",
    "however , magnetohydrodynamic accretion is under intense study , and it is difficult to be very specific about the time scale at this time @xcite .",
    "fast timescales have also been demonstrated in the case when a strong tidal perturbation applies to the disk @xcite . in this case",
    "it is the tidal perturbation of the primary on the secondary disk which causes accretion in the orbital timescale of the inner disk , i.e. in a timescale of a few days .",
    "the last element of the model that needs to be considered in detail is the spin of the secondary component .",
    "we propose that the binary model naturally leads to a high present time spin value of the secondary .",
    "first , we note that the sakimoto ",
    "coroniti disk model is gravitationally unstable at distances over @xmath136 for the oj 287 primary @xcite .",
    "however , during the coalesence of a supermassive black hole binary with a large mass ratio , the binary is expected to spend a longer time at smaller separations , or that the evolution would stall in what is known as the  final parsec problem  @xcite .",
    "a recent study by @xcite uses a theoretical prediction by @xcite to calculate that a coalescing supermassive black hole binary of a comparable mass ratio to oj 287 would reach a semi - major axis of @xmath137 in @xmath138 starting from an initial semi - major axis of @xmath139 .",
    "based on numerical work they find the total merger timescale to be greater than @xmath140 , for a system with parameters like oj 287 , which thus leaves at least @xmath141 for the secondary to accumulate spin through accretion of matter from the accretion disk of the primary .",
    "the accretion spin - up timescale can be estimated from the results initially derived in @xcite and further elaborated in @xcite .",
    "as the estimate of the current mass of the secondary is @xmath142 , the amount of rest mass it must have accreted to reach a spin of @xmath36 is @xmath143 . by the reasoning above and in @xcite",
    ", we would expect a mass of @xmath144 to be accreted by the secondary during one period @xmath145 , which leads to a fiducial accretion rate of @xmath146 .",
    "the scaling in @xcite gives @xmath147 at larger distances , and for the rest @xmath148 .",
    "using the values at @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 at @xmath152 , we find @xmath153 .",
    "thus we would expect the accretion rate to have been larger in the past , though considering the growth of eccentricity documented in @xcite , the impacts of the secondary have been at a distance of @xmath154 during most of the orbital evolution . thus using the value @xmath155 leads to an upper limit estimate of the spin - up timescale of @xmath156 , which is in line with the estimated time available for the accretion to occur .",
    "further , it is possible that the orbital plane of the secondary may have been closer the plane of the accretion disk of the primary before , having attained the current value of inclination at @xmath157 at a later time , as evidenced by the evolution of inclination in @xcite .",
    "this would have increased the accretion by the secondary , and further shortened the spin - up timescale .",
    "based on these considerations we would expect the secondary in the binary black hole model to have a high spin , at least compared to the primary spin value .    the resulting luminosity for the secondary is then comparable to the maximum bremsstrahlung luminosity arising from the hot bubbles torn off the disk @xcite or the luminosity of the primary accreting at the rate of @xmath158 , amplified by a reasonable forward beaming doppler factor . since the primary and secondary",
    "are expected to have similar doppler boosting factors , precursor flares originating from the secondary black hole could reasonably exceed the primary black hole luminosity for brief periods .",
    "as such , the case for precursor flares originating from the secondary is quite plausible .",
    "one of the best ways to verify the presence of the secondary jet in the radiation of oj 287 is to look for the shortest variability timescale .",
    "it should be related to the orbital period of the innermost stable circular orbit in the co - rotating case which is approximately 3.8 hours for the secondary , and 100 days for the primary . due to doppler boosting in the jet ,",
    "variability time scales down to about 15 minutes may appear in the secondary jet and about 5 days in the primary jet . therefore during secondary bursts the variability may be especially rapid .",
    "some evidence for this has been seen in the light curve of oj 287 prior to the 1983 great outburst @xcite .",
    "considering that the semi - major axis of the system corresponds to an observed angular diameter of @xmath159 , it might be possible to follow the orbital motion of the binary in the sky .",
    "this requires observational capabilities to progress to a spatial resolution at 10 microarcsecond level , possible with e.g. the gravity instrument @xcite .",
    "in addition to directly confirming the binary nature of the system , this would allow explicit coordination of light curve events with the phase of the binary orbit .",
    "we have studied three precursor flares in the light curve of oj 287 .",
    "we propose a model where these outbursts are caused by the secondary black hole impacting on a thick disk of the primary before the actual impact on the primary accretion disk .",
    "the precursor outburst is triggered by gas falling into the secondary black hole leading to its jet brightening .    using this model",
    "we predict a new precursor flare of to occur around @xmath2 , with a brightness of approximately @xmath15 above the quiescent level .",
    "it would be especially interesting to look for intra - day variability during this outburst .",
    "also we expect that intra - day variability will appear prominently in smaller outburst events between now and september 2013 when the secondary hits the primary accretion disk , and moves to the far side of the disk as seen by us .",
