    "number counting of faint galaxies is one of the most fundamental observational tests with which the formation / evolution of galaxies as well as the geometry of the universe is probed .",
    "the best view to date of the optical sky to faint flux levels is given by the hubble deep field ( hdf , williams et al .",
    "1996 ) , and it provides a valuable information to a wide range of studies on galaxies and cosmology .",
    "a comprehensive study of the hdf galaxy counts has been performed by pozzetti et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and they found that a simple model of pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) , in which galaxies evolve passively due to star formation histories without mergers or number evolution , gives a reasonable fit to the hdf counts in all the four passbands of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , when an open universe with @xmath13 is assumed .",
    "the increase of the number of galaxies with their apparent magnitude was originally proposed as a measure of the geometry of the universe ( sandage 1961 ) , and considerable efforts have been made along this line ( e.g. , yoshii & takahara 1988 ; fukugita , takahara , yamashita & yoshii 1990 ; yoshii & peterson 1991 ) .",
    "however , the obtained constraints on cosmological parameters based on the ple model have not been thought deterministic because of possible number evolution of galaxies by mergers .",
    "particularly , when the ple model is used , the einstein - de sitter ( eds ) universe ( @xmath14 ) underpredicts the observed galaxy counts at faint magnitudes , but a simple model of galaxy number evolution can reproduce the observed counts and save the eds universe ( rocca - volmerange & guiderdoni 1990 ; pozzetti et al .",
    "this degeneracy between the effects of galaxy evolution and cosmology has been a major problem when one uses the galaxy number count to determine the geometry of the universe .",
    "the information of redshifts is able to break such a degeneracy , because luminous galaxies at great distance are distinguishable from dwarf galaxies in a local universe .",
    "although most of the hdf galaxies are too faint to measure the spectroscopic redshifts , several catalogs of their photometric redshifts have been published ( sawicki , lin , & yee 1997 ; wang , bahcall , & turner 1998 ; fernndez - soto , lanzetta , & yahil 1999 ) .",
    "the follow - up studies based on these catalogs show that the photometric redshifts give reasonably reliable estimates of spectroscopic redshifts and are useful for a statistical study of the hdf galaxies . here",
    "we give a combined analysis for the hdf counts and redshifts and constrain the cosmological parameters separately from the merger history of galaxies .",
    "both the number count of faint galaxies and their redshift distribution are significantly affected by the selection effects inherent in the method of detecting galaxies in faint surveys , but these important effects have been ignored in almost all previous studies except for yoshii & fukugita ( 1991 ) and yoshii ( 1993 ) . it is well known that the surface brightness of galaxies rapidly becomes dimmer with increasing redshift as @xmath15 ( tolman 1934 ) , and this cosmological dimming makes many high - redshift galaxies remain undetected below the threshold value of surface brightness adopted in a galaxy survey ( pritchet & kline 1981 ; tyson 1984 ; ellis , sievers , & perry 1984 ) .",
    "the seeing or smoothing of an image furthermore lowers its surface brightness , and the photometry scheme used in a survey heavily affects a magnitude estimate of the faintest galaxies .",
    "some observers apply corrections to raw counts of faint galaxies for those undetected , but it is in principle difficult and heavily model - dependent to estimate the number of undetected galaxies . rather , the best way is to make theoretical predictions with the selection effects taken into account and then compare them directly to raw counts ( yoshii 1993 ) .",
    "this paper is the first analysis of the hdf galaxies in which the above selection bias against high - redshift galaxies is explicitly incorporated .",
    "we use a standard ple model of galaxies including the effects of internal dust obscuration and intergalactic hi absorption . number evolution of galaxies is also allowed for with simple modifications to the ple model . throughout this paper",
    ", we use the ab photometry system with the notation of @xmath16 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath1 ( williams et al .",
    "in  [ section : model ] , we present a detailed description for models of galaxy evolution and formulations to calculate galaxy counts and redshift distribution with the selection effects taken into account .",
    "extensive calculations of number count predictions and comparison to the hdf counts are given in ",
    "[ section : counts ] , checking in great detail the uncertainties arising from the prescribed properties of local galaxies and their evolution",
    ". we will give the comparison of the model predictions with the observed photometric redshift distribution in  [ section : redshifts ] .",
    "we discuss the results in  [ section : discussion ] .",
    "the summary and conclusion of this paper are given in ",
    "[ section : conclusions ] .",
    "first we describe the basic ingredients involved in our theoretical modeling such as the local luminosity function , galaxy evolution in luminosity and number , internal and intergalactic absorption , and the selection effects",
    ". then we will present the formulations to calculate the number count of faint galaxies and their redshift distribution .",
    "we use a standard ple model of galaxy evolution , in which galaxies are classified into five morphological types of e / s0 , sab , sbc , scd , and sdm .",
    "spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and their evolution are calculated by using the galaxy evolution model of arimoto & yoshii ( 1987 ) for elliptical galaxies and the i1 model of arimoto , yoshii , & takahara ( 1992 ) for spiral galaxies .",
    "these models are constructed to reproduce the photometric and chemical properties of present - day galaxies . in order to see the systematic uncertainty in evolution models",
    ", we will also use an updated version of these models by kobayashi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) using the latest database of stellar populations compiled by kodama & arimoto ( 1997 ) .",
    "we set the epoch of galaxy formation at @xmath17 as a standard and change this value to see the systematic uncertainty .",
    "the luminosity function of local galaxies is also important in predicting the number count and redshift distribution of faint galaxies .",
    "we use the type - dependent ( e / s0 , spiral , and irr ) @xmath10-band luminosity function derived from the second southern sky redshift survey ( ssrs2 , marzke et al .",
    "we associate the sab , sbc and scd models to be assigned to spiral galaxies , whereas the sdm model assigned to irregular galaxies .",
    "the relative proportions of sab , sbc , and scd are taken from pence ( 1976 ) . in order to check the systematic uncertainty related to the luminosity function",
    ", we also use the type - independent luminosity function of stromlo - apm redshift survey ( loveday et al .",
    "1992 ) and the type - dependent luminosity function from the center for astrophysics ( cfa ) redshift survey ( huchra et al . 1983 ) .",
    "their schechter parameters are tabulated in table [ table : lf ] ( see also efstathiou , ellis , & peterson 1988 and yoshii & takahara 1989 ) .",
    "the above models of galaxy evolution do not include the absorption by interstellar dust which becomes significant for high-@xmath18 galaxies when observed in optical bands . in order to take this effect into account",
    ", we make a physically natural assumption that the dust optical depth is proportional to the column density and metallicity of the gas .",
    "in fact , it is well known that the galactic extinction is well correlated to the column density of the hi gas ( e.g. , burstein & heiles 1982 ) .",
    "it is also known that the dust opacity becomes smaller in order of decreasing metallicity from the galaxy to the large and then small magellanic clouds , when the gas column density is fixed ( e.g. , pei 1992 ) . since the galaxy evolution models give the gas fraction @xmath19 and the metallicity @xmath20 in the gas , the dust optical depth is calculated from @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are the effective radius , the baryon mass , and the @xmath10-band luminosity of a galaxy , respectively .",
    "( we will describe the treatment of galaxy size in ",
    "[ section : selection ] . ) the proportionality constant @xmath25 is chosen to be consistent with the present - day , average extinction of @xmath26 taken from the galactic extinction map ( burstein & heiles 1982 ; schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) and a theoretical estimate ( hatano , branch , & deaton 1998 ) .",
    "the standard extinction curve of our galaxy ( e.g. , pei 1992 ) is used for the wavelength dependence of the optical depth .",
    "given the optical depth , the attenuation of emerging stellar lights depends on the spatial dust distribution . following disney , davies , & phillipps ( 1989 ) ,",
    "there are two extreme cases such as the screen model in which the dust is distributed on the line of sight to stars , and the slab model in which the dust has the same distribution with stars . neglecting the scattering of lights by dust , the attenuation factor of stellar lights",
    "is given by @xmath27 for the screen model and @xmath28/\\tau_{\\rm dust}$ ] for the slab model .",
    "in fact , the galaxy evolution model used here has been made to reproduce the present - day sed of galaxies which has been already affected by dust obscuration .",
    "we take into account this point and hence correct the above attenuation factors by using the optical depth at present .",
    "therefore the present - day seds of model galaxies are the same for all the prescriptions of dust - free , screen , and slab models .    in the slab model",
    "the apparent reddening reaches an asymptote when the optical depth becomes much larger than unity , because the observed lights are emitted from surface regions of a galaxy where the optical depth to an observer is low .",
    "however , the observed correlation between the power - law index of uv spectra and the balmer line ratio , both of which are a reddening indicator , extends well beyond the asymptote .",
    "this indicates that the observed reddening of starburst galaxies is larger than expected from the slab model , and at least some fraction of dust should behave like a screen ( for detail see calzetti , kinney , & storchi - bergmann 1994 ) .",
    "we then use the screen model as a standard , considering that uv and optical observations of starburst galaxies favor the screen dust .",
    "it may be an extreme prescription that all dust is distributed as a screen , but note that the emergent lights are rapidly attenuated exponentially once a considerable fraction of dust contributes to the screen .",
    "therefore the screen model is more appropriate than the slab model in which the attenuation factor decreases only moderately like @xmath29 when @xmath30 .",
    "the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of galaxies of various types are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed - dust ] at several epochs of galaxy evolution for three cases of dust extinction such as the screen model ( solid line ) , the slab model ( dashed line ) , and the no - extinction model ( dotted line ) .",
    "the effect of dust extinction is especially important for elliptical galaxies at high redshifts , where uv radiation is quite strong because of the initial starbursts supposed in the galactic wind model of elliptical galaxies ( arimoto & yoshii 1987 ) . according to the method described above , the dust optical depth during the initial starburst phase of elliptical galaxies",
    "is estimated to be much larger than unity ( @xmath31 ) for uv photons at @xmath32 2000    in the restframe .",
    "on the other hand , the evolution of dust obscuration makes uv luminosity of late - type spiral galaxies brighter at early epochs than that without the dust effect , because of the lower metal abundance than the present - day galaxies .",
    "however , this effect in late - type spiral galaxies is not significant because they are not heavily obscured at present .",
    "in addition to the internal absorption by dust , the intergalactic absorption significantly affects the visibility of high - redshift galaxies ( yoshii & peterson 1994 ; madau 1995 ) .",
    "lights from a distant galaxy at rest wavelengths below the lyman limit ( 912  ) and those below the lyman @xmath33 line ( 1216  ) are extinguished by lyman continuum absorption and lyman series line absorption , respectively , in intergalactic hi clouds along the line of sight .",
    "we include this effect consistently in our theoretical calculations making use of the intergalactic optical depth calculated by yoshii & peterson ( 1994 ) .",
    "the optical depth of this absorption is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : h1-abs ] , as a function of observed wavelength for various source redshifts .      apparent surface brightness and size of an image in a survey observation are the essential quantities for it to be detected as a real galaxy .",
    "we calculate these quantities of a model galaxy assuming its intrinsic luminosity profile and size and taking into account the cosmological dimming and the observational seeing . for the details of the formulations ,",
    "see yoshii ( 1993 ) .      in our ple model ,",
    "we assume that the galaxy size does not evolve except for the case of mergers of galaxies , and use the empirical relation between the effective radius @xmath22 and absolute luminosity @xmath24 for local galaxies .",
    "if we allow for the number evolution of galaxies , we must take into account the change of galaxy sizes , and we will discuss this in ",
    "[ sect : merger ] .",
    "[ fig : l - re ] shows the size - luminosity relation of local elliptical and spiral galaxies .",
    "the data of elliptical galaxies are taken from bender et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , and those of spiral galaxies from impey et al .",
    "although there is a significant scatter in this relation , we use a simple power - law relation for this relation as @xmath34 or , if expressed in terms of the absolute @xmath10 magnitude , @xmath35 elliptical galaxies form two distinct families which follow the well - separated sequences at low luminosities in the @xmath22-@xmath24 diagram .",
    "one is the ordinary sequence from giant through dwarf elliptical ( gde ) galaxies , while the other is the bright sequence from giant through compact elliptical ( gce ) galaxies ( see fig [ fig : l - re ] ) .",
    "since the predictions of galaxy number count are not sensitive to whichever sequence is used in the analysis ( see  [ section : model - dependence ] and fig [ fig : nm - r - e ] ) , we take the gde sequence as the standard size - luminosity relation of elliptical galaxies in this paper .    the @xmath22-@xmath24 relations fitted to the data in fig.[fig : l - re ] yield @xmath36 and ( 3.5,18.7 ) for the gde and gce sequences of elliptical galaxies , respectively , and ( 9.4 , 12 ) for spiral galaxies . in order to examine the uncertainty due to the significant scatter in the @xmath22-@xmath24 relation , we derive the standard deviation in @xmath37 from the best - fit relation and",
    "repeat calculations with the shifted relations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : l - re ] by the dashed lines .",
    "the radial distribution of surface brightness is assumed to follow de vaucouleurs ( 1962 ) profile ( @xmath38 ) for elliptical galaxies and an exponential profile for spiral galaxies ( freeman 1970 ) .",
    "then we can calculate the radial distribution of surface brightness of a galaxy at given redshift in any passband , when the galaxy type , the present - day @xmath10 luminosity , and the evolution model are specified .",
    "this surface brightness profile should be convolved with a gaussian point - spread function ( psf ) having the same dispersion with the observational seeing .",
    "let @xmath39 be the surface brightness threshold adopted in a galaxy survey .",
    "strictly , this threshold could change due to different noise levels within a survey field , but we use a single value for the simplicity . when the observed profile of a galaxy image is calculated as above",
    ", we can estimate the isophotal size which encircles a region of a galaxy image with surface brightness brighter than @xmath39 .",
    "if the isophotal size of a galaxy is zero , i.e. , the central surface brightness is fainter than @xmath39 , this galaxy can not be detected in the survey .",
    "usually a minimum isophotal diameter @xmath40 , which is comparable to the seeing size , is adopted as a condition for an image to be detected as a galaxy .",
    "we can calculate the isophotal diameter for a model galaxy , then it is easy to check whether this galaxy meets the detection criterion in the galaxy survey .",
    "there are three photometry schemes to evaluate the apparent magnitude of galaxies such as isophotal , aperture , and pseudo - total magnitudes .",
    "these magnitudes may significantly differ especially near the detection limit , and this difference should be included in the theoretical modeling of the selection effects inherent in the method of detecting faint galaxies .",
    "the isophotal magnitude is the flux within the isophotal size of a galaxy image .",
    "the aperture magnitude is the flux within a fixed aperture which is adopted by observers .",
    "some observers often make corrections to these magnitudes into pseudo - total magnitudes , which are intended to mimic an ideal total flux of a galaxy .",
    "however , such corrections use a model luminosity profile to evaluate the flux from an ` undetected ' part of a galaxy image .",
    "it is inappropriate to make a model - dependent correction to the observed quantities with which various theoretical models are compared .",
    "the best way is , on the contrary , to incorporate all the necessary corrections in the theoretical models to be compared directly with the observed quantities .",
    "we therefore suggest that observers should also present raw counts and magnitudes , in addition to presenting corrected quantities in their papers .      here",
    "we describe the detection processes of the hdf galaxies , following williams et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and see also bouwens , broadhurst , & silk ( 1998 ) .",
    "object detection is performed in the combined @xmath41 image .",
    "it is first convolved with a fixed smoothing kernel of 25 pixels ( = 0.04 square arcseconds ) , then pixels having values higher than a fixed threshold above a local sky background are marked as potentially being part of an object .",
    "after thresholding , regions consisting of more than contiguous 25 pixels are counted as sources .",
    "it corresponds to an isophotal diameter limit of @xmath42 0.2 arcsec , about 1.6 times larger than the fwhm of the psf .",
    "the surface brightness threshold is not clearly indicated in williams et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , but we can evaluate this value from the surface brightness distribution of the hdf galaxies . in fig . [",
    "fig : mag - s ] , we plot their apparent magnitudes versus average surface brightness in the four passbands of @xmath16 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath1 by using the published sizes and magnitudes of the hdf catalog . here",
    "the size refers to the isophotal size of the combined @xmath41 image , and the magnitude refers to the isophotal magnitude measured within the isophotal size .",
    "first we consider the @xmath4 and @xmath1 bands .",
    "figure [ fig : mag - s ] shows that no galaxies are detected when the average surface brightness is fainter than @xmath43 mag arcsec@xmath44 in @xmath4 and @xmath45 mag arcsec@xmath44 in @xmath1 .",
    "the faintest surface brightness detected in the hdf for galaxies with a fixed isophotal magnitude becomes brighter for brighter galaxies .",
    "this trend occurs because the size of galaxies is larger for brighter galaxies .",
    "the edge of an isophotal image corresponds to the isophotal limit , and hence its average surface brightness within the isophotal area is always brighter than its threshold when the galaxy image have a bright central part and therefore a larger size .",
    "consequently the faintest surface brightness at the faintest isophotal magnitudes , i.e. , @xmath43 mag arcsec@xmath44 in @xmath4 and @xmath45 mag arcsec@xmath44 in @xmath1 , gives the surface brightness threshold for object detection . in our calculations",

    "[ fig : mag - s ] . in our calculations",
    "the galaxies in the @xmath16 and @xmath3 bands are detected if they are detected in @xmath1 band and furthermore meet the criterion of @xmath46 within the isophotal area in the @xmath1 band ( i.e. , those below the dot - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : mag - s ] ) .",
    "currently the most popular theory for the structure formation in the universe is the bottom - up scenario with the cold dark matter which dominates the total mass density of the universe , in which smaller mass objects form earlier and then merge into larger objects ( e.g. , blumenthal et al . 1984 ) . merging history of dark matter haloes",
    "is relatively well studied by analytical methods as well as @xmath52-body simulations , but merging history of galaxies could significantly differ from that of dark matter haloes and is poorly known .",
    "since a number evolution of galaxies caused by galaxy mergers significantly affects the number count of faint galaxies , we investigate this effect by using a simple merging model in which the luminosity density of galaxies is conserved .",
    "a common practice for this is to introduce the redshift - dependent parameters of schechter - type luminosity function of galaxies such as @xmath53 we adopt a single value of @xmath54 for all types of galaxies for simplicity .    in the analysis of this paper ,",
    "the size of a galaxy is crucially important for evaluating the selection effects .",
    "merger of galaxies should change their size , and this should also be taken into account .",
    "the empirical relation @xmath55 may not hold at high redshifts , depending on how @xmath22 and @xmath24 change during the merger process .",
    "we assume that the change of @xmath24 and @xmath22 during merger processes always satisfy a relation @xmath56 .",

    "next we consider the eds universe where the ple count prediction is by more than one order of magnitudes smaller than those observed in the hdf ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nm - eds - merge ] ) .",
    "the predictions with @xmath54 = 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 are shown by four solid lines in order from bottom to top , with a fixed value of @xmath140 .",
    "the dotted line is the ple prediction without number evolution .",
    "this result indicates that a strong number evolution with @xmath0 34 is necessary to explain the hdf counts in the eds universe .",
    "we note that , while the strong number evolution explains the counts at the faintest magnitudes , it fails to explain the overall shape or slope of the @xmath52-@xmath132 relation .",
    "this failure is clearly seen in the @xmath3 band , where the strong number evolution makes the count slope less steep and deviate from the observations most prominently at @xmath3 = 2226 .",
    "this argument is quite robust , because there should be an upper bound in the steepness of the @xmath52-@xmath132 slope ( @xmath141 0.4 ) , when the total luminosity density of all galaxies is conserved during the merger process . in a more realistic case such as gas - rich mergers inducing starbursts ,",
    "an even flatter slope is predicted , because galaxies before mergers are always fainter than those in the case of luminosity - density conservation . if one tries to explain the observed steep slope by mergers , it is necessary to contribe a merger process where galaxies before mergers are always brighter , in other words , the luminosity density of galaxies increases if the merger process is traced backwards  which we consider quite unrealistic .",
    "therefore , we conclude that a strong number evolution in the eds universe is unlikely to explain the observed counts over the whole range of apparent magnitudes .    figure [ fig : nm - open - merge ] shows the effect of introducing a number evolution model in an open universe with @xmath142 .",
    "the lines in this figure have the same meanings as in fig .",
    "[ fig : nm - eds - merge ] , but the four solid lines are the predictions with @xmath54 = 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 in order from bottom to top . in this open universe ,",
    "a number evolution with @xmath143 is necessary to explain the faintest counts , but again it can not explain the steep slope of the @xmath52-@xmath132 relation in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands .",
    "this indicates that an open universe is also difficult to explain the hdf counts if @xmath144 .",
    "however , a lower - density open universe , for example , with @xmath145 might give a similar result with a @xmath6-dominated flat universe with @xmath142 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nm - sel - nosel ] ) , and such an open universe could also explain the hdf counts if a modest number evolution of galaxies is taken into account .",
    "although not as reliable as spectroscopic redshifts , photometric redshifts of galaxies are useful for statistical studies of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "several groups have published catalogs of photometric redshifts for the hdf galaxies ( e.g. , sawicki , lin , & yee 1997 ; wang , bahcall , & turner 1998 ; fernndez - soto , lanzetta , & yahil 1999 ) .",
    "here we compare our theoretical model with the photometric redshift distributions reaching @xmath146 derived by fernndez - soto et al .",

    "the area over which the models are calculated is chosen to coincide with the sky area covered by the observational analysis of fernndez - soto et al .",
    "( 1999 ) : 5.31 arcmin@xmath149 for @xmath150 and 3.92 arcmin@xmath149 for @xmath151 .",
    "therefore , not only the shape but also the normalization of the predicted redshift distributions can be compared directly with the data .",
    "the solid and dashed lines are the models with @xmath152 and ( 1 , 3 ) , respectively , with the selection effects taken into account .",
    "the dot - dashed line is the same as the dashed line with @xmath153 , but no selection effects are taken into account .",
    "it is clear that the selection effects give a bias against high - redshift galaxies , and this selection bias is significant especially at the faintest magnitudes .",
    "it is inevitable to include these effects when one uses the redshift distribution as a probe of number evolution of galaxies .",
    "comparison with the data shows that a modest merger model with @xmath154 in a @xmath6-dominated flat universe gives a reasonable fit to the photometric redshift distribution as well as galaxy counts , provided that the selection effects are properly taken into account .",
    "figure [ fig : nz - eds ] compares the observed redshift distribution with the predictions in the eds universe .",

    "the selection effects are taken into account in all curves .",
    "a strong number evolution predicts that most of galaxies have lower redshifts of @xmath155 1 , deviating significantly from the observed distribution for @xmath156 . if the assumption of conserved luminosity density is relaxed , the predicted distribution becomes peaked at an even lower redshift , because pre - merger galaxies in more realistic merger models are fainter than expected from the conserved luminosity density , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "this gives another argument that the eds universe can not explain the observed number of hdf galaxies even if a strong merger is invoked , in addition to the argument in the previous section against the eds universe based on the slope of the observed @xmath52-@xmath132 relation .",
    "figure [ fig : nz - open ] is similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : nz - eds ] , but for an open universe with @xmath142 .",
    "the predicted redshift distribution is still peaked at a lower redshift compared with the observed distribution .",
    "this discrepancy is significant for @xmath156 , but not as serious as in the eds universe .",
    "in this paper we have shown that a strong number evolution with @xmath0 34 is necessary to explain the hdf counts at the faintest magnitudes in the eds universe .",
    "the photometric redshift distribution of hdf galaxies suggests that a significant number of the faintest galaxies are at @xmath157 , and hence there must be a strong number evolution already operated at @xmath157 to increase the number of galaxies by factor of about 10 .",
    "therefore , further argument for or against the eds universe with strong number evolution of galaxies can be made from the observational constraints based on spectroscopic redshift surveys at @xmath157 .",
    "totani & yoshii ( 1998 ) argued that such a strong number evolution at @xmath157 is clearly inconsistent with the spectroscopic catalogs of galaxies reaching @xmath158 , at least for giant galaxies with @xmath159 .",
    "this is based on a @xmath160 test for the galaxies in the canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs , lilly et al .",
    "1995 ) , and an important finding is that the ple model is not inconsistent with the spectroscopic data , giving a constraint on number evolution as @xmath161 , @xmath162 , and @xmath163 for the eds universe , an open @xmath164 universe , and a flat @xmath138 universe , respectively .",
    "although the @xmath160 test favors a larger @xmath54 in the eds universe , this value seems smaller than that required to explain the hdf counts at the faintest magnitudes .",
    "these results have been confirmed for elliptical galaxies by shade et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , in which they found that the population of massive early - type galaxies was largely in place by @xmath158 .",
    "an independent constraint on galaxy mergers at @xmath165 comes from statistical studies of merging galaxies inferred from high - resolution images .",
    "recently , le fvre et al .",
    "( 2000 ) derived the evolution of merger rate from the hst images of the cfrs and ldss galaxies .",
    "their result suggests that @xmath166 galaxies on the average have undergone about one merger event from @xmath167 to 0 , which corresponds to @xmath136 and hence this is consistent with the number evolution in a @xmath6-dominated flat universe suggested by this paper .",
    "pozzetti et al .",
    "( 1998 ) claimed that the ple model can not explain all the observed data , although it well explains the hdf galaxy counts .",
    "the major discrepancies between the ple model and the observed data were found in the evolution of the luminosity density in the universe .",
    "that is , the observed luminosity density increases more steeply to @xmath168 than the ple model prediction , and on the other hand , the ple model predicts too high uv luminosity density at @xmath169 compared with the observation , because of intense starbursts in elliptical galaxies .",
    "however , totani , yoshii , & sato ( 1997 ) had already pointed out that the observed steep evolution to @xmath158 is explained in a @xmath6-dominated flat universe .",
    "it has already been argued that the ple model is consistent with the observed luminosity density evolution if initial starbursts in high - redshift elliptical galaxies are obscured or not existent .",
    "in fact , our calculation of the redshift distribution in this paper shows that initial starbursts are not detected at @xmath170 , because of the dust obscuration and the selection effects .",
    "therefore , the major problems of the ple model claimed by pozzetti et al .",
    "( 1998 ) are resolved , and the ple model in a @xmath6-dominated flat universe gives a reasonable fit to the observed hdf data , allowing only for a modest number evolution of galaxies with @xmath7 .",
    "we have modeled the number count and redshift distribution of faint hdf galaxies , with the observational selection effects properly taken into account . as a consequence of the selection effects in the theoretical modeling , predicted counts from the ple model are smaller than previously considered , and they are more than 10 times smaller than the observed hdf counts at the faintest magnitudes in the eds universe .",
    "a strong number evolution with @xmath0 34 under the assumption of conserved luminosity density is required to explain the faintest counts in this eds universe , when the number evolution is parametrized as @xmath2 and @xmath171 .",
    "however , such a strong number evolution is not consistent with the overall @xmath52-@xmath132 slope or the photometric redshift distribution .",
    "these discrepancies become even worse when one considers a more realistic merger process , i.e. , enhanced star formation following by gas - rich mergers . in addition , such a strong evolution is rejected at least for average @xmath166 galaxies at @xmath157 from the data of spectroscopic redshift surveys ( totani & yoshii 1998 ; shade et al . 1999 ; le fvre et al . 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that it is almost impossible to explain the hdf galaxies in the eds universe , unless we invoke ultra - exotic galaxy populations such as galaxies forming only massive stars at high redshifts to escape from local galaxy surveys due to the complete lack of long - lived stars .",
    "the present work revitalizes the practice of using faint number counts as an important cosmological test , which gives one of the arguments against the eds universe by its outstanding statistics compared with other cosmological tests .",
    "an open universe with @xmath172 does not fit to the hdf data either , for the similar reasons for rejecting the eds universe .",
    "an open universe with @xmath173 might be consistent with the hdf data , but such a low value of @xmath173 would not be reconciled with other constraints on @xmath174 , such as the baryon - gas to dark - matter mass ratio in poor clusters of galaxies combined with the standard big - bang nucleosynthesis prediction of baryon mass density in the universe ( e.g. , pedersen , yoshii , & sommer - larsen 1997 ) .    we have extensively checked systematic uncertainties in our theoretical modeling of galaxy formation and evolution , and found that they are unlikely to resolve the above discrepancies emerged in the eds universe and also in an open universe . on the other hand ,",
    "such discrepancies are naturally resolved if we invoke a @xmath6-dominated flat universe .",
    "this suggests that the existence of the cosmological constant or an exotic form of the vacuum energy density of the universe which is now accelerating the expansion of the universe .",
    "the ple model in a @xmath6-dominated flat universe with @xmath175 gives a reasonable fit to the hdf data , and a modest number evolution with @xmath7 is also suggested by the hdf counts at the faintest magnitudes .",
    "it should be noted that this number evolution does not necessarily mean mergers of galaxies , but may suggest strongly clumpy star - forming regions within an individual galaxy system becoming visible at high redshifts ( colley et al .",
    "1996 ; bunker , spinrad , & thompson 1999 ) .    on the other hand , it is interesting to note that this indication of mild number evolution is consistent with the merger rate evolution of @xmath166 galaxies at @xmath157 recently inferred from a high - resolution image study for galaxies in the cfrs survey ( le fvre et al .",
    "this result is consistent with some models of galaxy formation based on the hierarchical structure formation in the cdm universe ( le fvre et al .",
    "2000 ) , although there are considerable uncertainties in the theoretical calculations for the merging history of baryonic component .",
    "a stronger number evolution with @xmath139 is , however , strongly disfavored by the observed hdf galaxy counts",
    ". this will give an important constraint when galaxy formation is modeled in the framework of the structure formation in a cold dark matter universe .",
    "inclusion of the selection effects in this paper leads to a considerably different result from previous studies on galaxy number count and redshift distribution .",
    "this means that any cosmological interpretations will be seriously misled if the selection effects are ignored .",
    "all future studies related to the detection and statistics of high - redshift galaxies should take into account these effects .",
    "the selection effects give a bias against high - redshift galaxies , reducing a problem of overprediction of such galaxies by the ple model , which has been claimed by several studies ignoring the selection effects ( e.g. , ellis 1997 ) .",
