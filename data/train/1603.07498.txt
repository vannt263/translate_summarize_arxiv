    "random percolation models such as last passage percolation ( lpp ) and interacting particle systems like the asymmetric simple exclusion process , have been extensively studied in the past decades and they exhibit limit fluctuations laws common to random matrix theory as well ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    in the last passage percolation model on @xmath0 ,",
    "one assigns to each @xmath1 an independent random variable @xmath2 .",
    "one can think of @xmath0 to have edges directed to the right and upwards .",
    "then , given two points @xmath3 and @xmath4 which can be connected through directed paths , the basic random variable of interest in lpp is the last passage time , @xmath5 where the maximum is over the set of directed paths connecting @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the definition extends naturally to the case where @xmath3 ( and/or @xmath4 ) are sets of points .",
    "the lpp model is related with an interacting particle system , the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) as follows . in tasep",
    "there are particles on @xmath6 , with the exclusion constraint that one site can be occupied by at most one particle .",
    "the dynamics in continuous time is simple : particles jump to their right neighbor with a given jump rate , but jumps which would lead to a violation of the exclusion constraint are suppressed ( see  @xcite for the construction and main properties of tasep and related models ) .",
    "if @xmath7 are taken to be waiting times of the jumps of particles and @xmath3 a set given in terms of the initial position of tasep particles , then the distribution of the last passage time equals the distribution of the position of a given particle ( see section  [ sectlpp ] for more details ) .",
    "tasep is one model in the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) universality class  @xcite in @xmath8 dimensions ( see surveys and lecture notes  @xcite ) .",
    "the observable which is mostly studied in kpz models is , in terms of tasep , the joint distribution of particle positions in the limit of large time @xmath9 . from kpz",
    "scaling one expects that particles are correlated over a distance of order @xmath10 , while the fluctuation of their position is of order @xmath11 . the ( conjecturally universal ) limiting processes around positions where the density of particle is macroscopically smooth",
    "are also known  @xcite .",
    "the situation changes drastically when tasep dynamics generates a shock , i.e. , the density of particles has a discontinuity .",
    "in this situation the distribution of the rescaled particle position changes over distances of order @xmath11 instead of @xmath10 as shown in  @xcite .",
    "one result of the present paper is the extension of the findings of  @xcite to joint distributions of particle positions around the shock , using the good control over local fluctuations in lpp models established by cator and pimentel in  @xcite , see section  [ sectmultipts ] , theorem  [ mltp ] .",
    "however , the main motivation for this paper is the study of a different observable in lpp , namely the so - called _ competition interface _ introduced by ferrari and pimentel in  @xcite .",
    "basically they consider two lines @xmath12 starting at the origin with @xmath13 ( resp .",
    "@xmath14 ) in the second ( resp .",
    "fourth ) quadrant and color the region above @xmath15 with two colors , a point is ( say ) red if the lpp time from @xmath13 to it is larger than from @xmath14 and blue otherwise .",
    "the interface between the two colors is called the competition interface .",
    "interestingly , the competition interface and the trajectory of the second class particle in tasep are the same  @xcite ( see also section  [ sectsecondclass ] ) .",
    "the importance of second class particles , is that in presence of shocks they can be used to identify it  @xcite , while for stationary initial conditions the distribution of its position is proportional to the two - point function , quantity measuring the space - time correlation  @xcite ) .",
    "if the lines @xmath12 have asymptotically a fixed direction , then the direction of the competition interface converges almost surely to a value which might be deterministic or random as shown by ferrari , martin and pimentel in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) .",
    "in particular , when in the tasep framework there is a shock , the competition interface satisfies a ( deterministic ) law of large numbers ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is the study of the fluctuation of the competition interface in presence of shocks . in theorem  [ comp2speed ]",
    "we have a clt type result for the fluctuations of the position of the competition interface with some deterministic @xmath12 .",
    "the difference with the standard clt is that the fluctuations at distance @xmath9 from the origin are of order @xmath11 and the distribution law is not gaussian .",
    "this result serves as illustration of theorem  [ genthm ] which applies to more general lpp problems .",
    "finally , in theorem  [ berthm ] we show gaussian fluctuations for the fluctuations of the competition interface in the case that @xmath12 are random walks corresponding to tasep with initial condition given by the product measure with density @xmath16 on @xmath17 and @xmath18 on @xmath19 ( with @xmath20 ) . in that case",
    "the second class particle has also gaussian fluctuations in the @xmath21 scale around the macroscopic shock position  @xcite .",
    "although the position of the competition interface is a random time change of the position of the second class particle  @xcite ( see also section  [ sectsecondclass ] ) , it is not straightforward to connect the two quantities when the speed of the shock is non - zero .",
    "the analogue result for the time - changed process ( essentially for the second - class particle ) can be found in theorem  4 of  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for related studies for the hammersley process ) .",
    "the results obtained in this paper are based on the asymptotic independence of two lpp problems , which in turn are based on the slow - decorrelation phenomenon occurring along the characteristic lines  @xcite .",
    "for tasep with stationary initial conditions  @xcite , i.e. , bernoulli product measure with @xmath22 , this can not be applied anymore .",
    "this case has been however studied fairly well .",
    "firstly , one can identify the competition interface with the maximizer of the ( backwards ) lpp problem  @xcite .",
    "secondly , the second class particle starting from the origin has some explicitly known scaling function  @xcite .",
    "recent progresses on the knowledge of the time - time correlation in the kpz height function  @xcite show that it would be relevant to study the competition interface and the second class particle as a process in time as well .",

    "we denote by @xmath40 any path for which the maximum in is attained and call @xmath40 a maximizing path . in the lpp models we consider in this paper , @xmath40 is always a.s .",
    "last passage percolation is linked to the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) in the following way . in tasep",
    ", each @xmath41 is occupied by at most one particle , and each particle waits an exponential time ( whose parameter may depend on the particle ) before it jumps one step to the right iff its right neighbor is not occupied .",
    "labeling particles from right to left @xmath42 we denote by @xmath43 the position of particle @xmath44 at time @xmath9 and have that at all time @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",

    "define @xmath48 and weights @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the parameter of the exponential clock attached to particle @xmath51 .",

    "the aim of this section is to obtain limit results for the competition interface in the lpp model , .",
    "the competition interface is essentially the boundary of the region where the lpp to @xmath13 is larger than the lpp to @xmath14 .",
    "here we study the lpp model defined by , with a competition interface , which was introduced in  @xcite . to associate a competition interface to the lpp time , we consider tasep with initial data satisfying @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "note that for such initial data we have ( with @xmath58 defined in ) almost surely @xmath59 for @xmath60 .",
    "we then define two clusters via @xmath61    we can think of the points in @xmath62 as painted red , and the points in @xmath63 as painted blue .",
    "each @xmath64 thus has a well - defined color .",
    "the two colors are separated through the competition interface @xmath65 : set @xmath66 and define @xmath67 inductively via @xmath68 and we write @xmath69 .",
    "we always have @xmath70 in our model since @xmath71 .",
    "note that @xmath72 and @xmath73 is red for @xmath74 and blue for @xmath75 .    in  @xcite",
    "some aspects of the competition interface are studied . in theorem  1 of  @xcite it",
    "is shown ( under the assumption that @xmath76 have asymptotically fixed directions ) that @xmath77 almost surely , for some @xmath78 , which might be random or deterministic . in theorem  2 of",
    "@xcite they determined the distribution function of @xmath78 for the case corresponding to tasep with bernoulli - bernoulli initial conditions with higher density on @xmath17 than @xmath79 .",
    "this corresponds to a situation with a macroscopically decreasing particle density profile ( the so - called rarefaction fan ) .",
    "furthermore , for initial conditions generating a shock for tasep , they prove that @xmath78 is non - random ( with an explicit value given in term of the shock velocity ) .",
    "thus for situation with a shock for tasep , their result is a law of large number type of result . in our contribution",
    "we want to analyze the fluctuations with respect to the law of large number .",
    "it is a clt type of result , with the particularity that the fluctuations live in a @xmath80 scale and the distribution function is not gaussian .    in theorem  [ genthm ]",
    "we determine the distribution function for @xmath81 ( properly centered and scaled ) under a few assumptions , which need to be verified case by case ( as they depend on @xmath76 and the chosen law of the randomness @xmath82 ) . in order to illustrate the result",
