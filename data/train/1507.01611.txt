    "despite the many advances in traditional data recording techniques , the surge of big data platforms and energy conservation issues have imposed new challenges to the storage community in terms of identifying extremely high volume , non - volatile and durable recording media .",
    "the potential for using macromolecules for ultra - dense storage was recognized as early as in the 1960s , when the celebrated physicists richard feynman outlined his vision for nanotechnology in the talk `` there is plenty of room at the bottom . '' among known macromolecules , dna is unique in so far that it lends itself to implementations of non - volatile recoding media of outstanding integrity ( one can still recover the dna of species extinct for more than 10,000 years ) and extremely high storage capacity ( a human cell , with a mass of roughly 3 pgrams , hosts dna encoding 6.4 gb of information ) .",
    "building upon the rapid growth of biotechnology systems for dna synthesis and sequencing , two laboratories recently outlined architectures for archival dna based storage in  @xcite .",
    "the first architecture achieved a density of 700 tb / gram , while the second approach raised the density to 2 pb / gram .",
    "the success of the later method was largely attributed to the use of three elementary coding schemes , huffman coding ( a fixed - to - variable length entropy coding / compression method ) , differential coding ( encoding the differences of consecutive symbols or the difference between a sequence and a given template ) and single parity - check coding ( encoding of a single symbol indicating the parity of the string ) .",
    "more recent work  @xcite extended the coding approach used in  @xcite in so far by replacing single parity - check codes by reed - solomon codes  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : outline ]    all the aforementioned approaches have a number of drawbacks , including the lack of partial access to data ",
    "i.e. , one has to reconstruct the whole sequence in order to read even one base  and the unavailability of rewrite mechanisms .",
    "moving from a read only to a random access , rewritable memory requires a major paradigm shift in the implementation of the dna storage system , as one has to append unique addresses to constituent storage dna blocks that will not lead to erroneous cross - hybridization with the information encoded in the blocks ; avoid using overlapping dna blocks for increased coverage and subsequent synthesis , as they prevent efficient rewriting ; ensure low synthesis ( write ) and sequencing ( read ) error rates of the dna blocks . to overcome these and other issues",
    ", the authors recently proposed a ( hybrid ) dna rewritable storage architecture with random access capabilities  @xcite .",
    "the new dna - based storage scheme encompasses a number of coding features , including constrained coding , ensuring that dna patterns prone to sequencing errors are avoided ; prefix synchronized coding , ensuring that blocks of dna may be accurately accessed without perturbing other blocks in the dna pool ; and low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) coding for classically stored redundancy combating rewrite errors  @xcite .",
    "the shared features of current dna - based storage architectures are depicted in figure  [ fig : outline ] .",
    "the green circles denote the source and media , while the blue circles denote processing methods applied on the source and media .",
    "the processes of encoding and dna encoding add controlled redundancy into the original source of digital information or into the dna blocks , respectively .",
    "this redundancy can be use to combat synthesis ( write ) and sequencing ( access and read ) errors  @xcite .",
    "synthesis is the biochemical process of creating physical double - stranded dna strings that reliably represent the encoded data strings .",
    "synthesis thereby also creates the storage media itself  the dna blocks .",
    "storage refers to some means of storing the dna strings , and it represents a communication channel that transfers information from one point in time to another . in rewritable architectures  @xcite , the editing module refers to the process of creating mutations in the stored dna strings ( by deleting one or multiple substrings and potentially inserting other strings ) , while the reading module refers to dna sequencing that retrieves the content of selected dna storage blocks and subsequent decoding .    in order to understand how errors occur during the read and write process , we start our exposition by describing state - of - the art synthesis , sequencing and editing methods ( sections  [ sec : synthesis ] ,  [ sec : editing ] ,  [ sec : sequencing ] ) .",
    "we then proceed to discuss how synthesis , sequencing and editing methods are used in various dna - storage paradigms ( section  [ sec : architectures ] ) , and the accompanying coding techniques identified with different types of synthesis and sequencing errors .",
    "new constrained coding techniques for rewritable and random access systems , and their relationship to classical codes for magnetic and optical storage , are described in section  [ sec : coding ] .    given the semi - tutorial and interdisciplinary nature of this manuscript , we refer readers with a limited background in synthetic biology to appendix  [ sec : appendix ] for a glossary of terms used throughout the paper .",
    "de novo dna synthesis is a powerful biotechnology that enables the creation of dna sequences without pre - existing templates .",
    "synthesis tools have a myriad of applications in different research areas , ranging from traditional molecular biology to emerging fields of synthetic biology , nanotechnology and data storage . vaguely speaking ,",
    "most technologies for large - scale dna synthesis rely on the assembly of pools of oligonucleotide building blocks into increasingly larger dna fragments .",
    "the current high cost and small throughput of de novo synthesis of these building blocks represents the main limitation for widespread implementations of dna synthesis systems : as an example , oligo synthesis methods via _ phosphoramidite column - based synthesis _",
    ", described in subsequent sections , may cost as much as  $ 0.15 per nucleotide  @xcite .",
    "the maximum length of the produced oligostrings lies in the range 100 - 200 nts  @xcite .",
    "hence , the synthesis of long dna oligos using dozens of building blocks can cost anywhere from hundreds to thousands of us dollars .",
    "therefore , it is imperative to develop new , high - quality , robust , and scalable dna synthesis technologies that offer synthetic dna at significantly more affordable prices .",
    "this is in particular the case for massive dna - based storage systems , which may potentially require billions of nucleotides .    among the most promising synthesis technologies",
    "is the so called _ microarray - based _ synthesis methods ; more than ten - to - hundreds of thousands oligos can be synthesized per one microarray , in conjunction with a decrease in the reagent consumption . for large scale dna synthesis projects ,",
    "the price of microarray - based synthesis is roughly  $ 0.001 per nucleotide  @xcite .",
    "similarly to the case of phosphoramidite column - based synthesis , the length of microarray synthesized oligos usually does not exceed @xmath0 nt .",
    "however , oligos synthesized in microarrays typically suffer from higher error rates than those generated by phosphoramidite column methods .",
    "nevertheless , microarrays are the preferred synthesis tool for generating customized dna - chips or for performing gene synthesis .",
    "many projects are underway to bridge the gap between these two extremes , hight - cost and high - accuracy and low - cost , low - accuracy strategies and hence reduce the limitations of the corresponding methods  @xcite .    to provide a better understanding of the basic principles of dna - based storage and the limitations that need to be overcome in the writing process",
    ", we first describe different dna synthesis methods from nucleotides to larger dna molecules .",
    "we then discuss recent techniques that aim to improve the quality and reliability of the synthesized sequences .",
    "chemical synthesis of single stranded dna originated more than @xmath1 years ago , and since the 1950 s , when the first oligonucleotides were synthesized  @xcite , four different chemical methods have been developed .",
    "these methods are named after the major reagents included in the process , and include i ) h - phosphonate ; ii ) phosphodiester ; iii ) phosphotriester ; and iv ) phosphite triester / phosphoramidite .",
    "a detailed description of these methods may be found in  @xcite , and here we only briefly review the advantages and disadvantages of these methods .",
    "the h - phosphonate method was first described in  @xcite , and it derives its name from the use of h - phosphonates nucleotides as building blocks .",
    "this approach was later refined in  @xcite , where the h - phosphonate chemistry was improved to synthesize deoxyoligonucleotides on a solid support by using different oligo coupling ( stitching ) agents that expedite the reactions .",
    "the phosphodiester method was introduced in  @xcite .",
    "the main contribution of the method was the production of _ protected dinucleotide monoposhpates _ , which prevented undesired elongation .",
    "unfortunately , the approach also had one major drawback  the linkages between nucleotides were unprotected during the elongation step of the oligonucleotide chain , which allowed for the creation of branched oligonucleotides .",
    "the phosphotriester approach was also first published in the 50s  @xcite and later improved by letsinger  @xcite and reese  @xcite using different reagents to protect the phosphate group in the internucleotide linkages .",
    "this approach also prevented the formation of branched oligonucleotides .",
    "nevertheless , all the previously described methods and variants thereof proved to be inefficient and time consuming .    in the mid - seventies , a major advantage in synthesis technology",
    "was reported by letsinger  @xcite , solving in part a number of problems associated with other existing methods .",
    "his method was termed the _",
    "phosphite triester approach_. the basic idea behind the approach was that the reagent phosphorochloridite reacts with nucleotides faster than its chloridate counterpart used in previous approaches .",
    "in addition to expediting their underlying reactions , bifunctional phosphorodichloridites unfortunately also produced undesirable side products such as symmetric dimers .",
    "a modified method that precluded the drawback of side products was developed by caruthers _",
    "et al . _",
    "the authors of  @xcite used a different type of nucleoside phosphites that were more stable , reacted faster , and produced higher yields of the desired dinucleoside phosphite . the resulting method was named _",
    "phosphoramidite synthesis_. another important contribution includes the technology described in  @xcite , where the use of stable and easy - to - prepare phosphoramidites facilitated the automation of oligo synthesis in solid - phase , making it the method - of - choice for chemical synthesis .",
    "[ fig : column ]      the standard phosphoramidite oligonucleotide synthesis operates via stepwise addition of nucleotides to the growing chain which is immobilized on a solid support ( figure  [ fig : column ] ) .",
    "each addition cycle consists of four chemical steps : i ) de - blocking ; ii ) coupling or condensation ; iii ) capping ; and iv ) oxidation  @xcite . at the beginning of the synthesis process , the first nucleotide , which is attached to a solid substrate , is completely protected at all of its active sites .",
    "therefore , to make a reaction possible and include a second nucleotide , it is necessary to remove the dimethoxytrityl ( dmt ) protecting group from the 5-end by addition of an acid solution .",
    "the removal of the dmt group generates a reactive 5-oh group ( de - blocking step ) .",
    "subsequently , a coupling step is performed via condensation of a newly activated dmt - protected nucleotide and the unprotected 5-oh group of the substrate - bound growing oligostrand through the formation of a phosphite triester link ( coupling or condensation step ) .",
    "after the coupling step , some unprotected 5-oh groups may still exist and react in later stages of additions of nucleotides leading to oligos with _ deletion and bursty deletion errors_. to mitigate this problem , a capping reaction is performed by acetylation of the unreactive nucleotides ( capping step ) .",
    "finally , the unstable phosphite triester linkage is oxidized to a more stable phosphate linkage using an iodine solution ( oxidation step ) .",
    "the cycle is repeated iteratively to obtain an oligonucleotide of the desired sequence composition . at the end of the synthesis ,",
    "the oligonucleotide sequence is deprotected , and cleaved from the support to obtain a completely functional unit .      in the 90s ,",
    "affymetrix developed a method for chemical synthesis of different polymers combining photolabile protecting groups and photolithography  @xcite .",
    "the affymetrix solution uses a photolithographic mask to direct uv light in a targeted manner , so as to selectively deprotect and activate 5 hydroxyl groups of nucleotides that should react with the nucleotide to be incorporated in the next step .",
    "the mask is designed to expose specific sites on the microarray to which new nucleotides will be added , with others sites being masked .",
    "once synthesis is completed , the oligos are released from the array support and recovered as a complex mixture ( pool ) of sequences .    a number of other , related methods have been developed for the purpose of synthesizing oligostrands on microarrays  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the method developed by agilent uses ink - jet - based printing , where with high precision , picoliters of each incorporated nucleotide and activator can be spotted ( deposited ) at specific sites on an array .",
    "this ink - jet method mitigates the need for using photolithography masks  @xcite . in an alternative method commercialized by nimblegen systems ,",
    "the photolithography masks are superseded by a virtual mask that is combined with digital programmable mirrors to activate specific locations on the array  @xcite .",
    "customarray ( former combimatrix ) developed a technology in which thousands of microelectrodes control acid production by an electrochemical reaction to deprotect the growing oligo at a desired spot  @xcite .",
    "in addition , oligo synthesis is implemented within a multi - chamber microfluidic device coupled to a digital optical device that uses light to produce acid in the chambers  @xcite .",
    "masking and printing errors may introduce both _",
    "substitution _ and _ insertion and deletion _ errors , and when multiple sequences are synthesized simultaneously , the error patterns within different sequences may be correlated , depending on the location of their synthesis spots .",
    "both solid - phase and microarray technologies exhibit a number of challenges that need to be overcome to reduce error rates and increase throughout .",
    "side reactions such as depurination  @xcite and reaction inefficiencies during the stepwise addition of nucleotides  @xcite reduce the desired yield , and generate errors in the sequence especially when synthesizing long oligostrands .",
    "in particular , these processing problems introduce both _",
    "substitution _ and _ insertion and deletion _ errors .",
    "thus , a purification step is usually necessary to identify and discard undesirable erroneous sequences .",
    "high - performance liquid chromatography and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis can be used to eliminate truncated products , but both are expensive and time - consuming , and single insertions and deletions or substitution errors in the sequence often can not be removed . nevertheless , by optimizing chemical reaction and conditions the fidelity",
    "can be increased  @xcite .      traditionally , to generate dna fragments of length",
    "several hundred nucleotides , a set of shorter length oligostrands is fused together by either using ligation - based or polymerase - based reactions .",
    "ligation - based approaches usually rely on thermostable dna ligases that ligate phosphorylated overlapping oligos in high stringency conditions  @xcite . in polymerase - based approaches ( polymerase cycling assembly - pca )",
    "oligos with overlapping regions are used to generate progressively longer double - stranded sequences  @xcite .",
    "after assembly , synthesized sequences need to be pcr amplified , cloned , and verified , thus increasing the cost of production .",
    "another approach developed by gibson _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite exploits yeast in vivo recombination to assemble a set of more than @xmath2 oligos together with a plasmid , all in one step .",
    "the same group also synthesized the mouse mitochondrial genome from @xmath3 overlapping oligos using an isothermal assembly method  @xcite .    although microarray synthesis reduces the price of oligonucleotides , there are two major challenges that still hamper its use .",
    "first , hundreds of thousands of oligonucleotides can be made on a single microarray , but each oligo is produced in very small amounts .",
    "second , the oligostrands are cleaved from the array all at once as a large heterogeneous pool that subsequently leads to difficulties in sequence assembly and cross - hybridization .",
    "a number of strategies have been recently developed to solve these problems .",
    "for example , pcr amplification increases the concentration of the oligos before assembly that combined with hybridization selection reduces the incorporation of oligonucleotides containing undesirable synthesis errors  @xcite .",
    "a modification of this approach , based on hybridization selection embedded in the assembly process and coupled with the optimization of oligo design and assembly conditions was reported in  @xcite . still",
    ", large pools of oligos ( > @xmath4 ) increase difficulties in sequence assembly .",
    "two different strategies have been described where subpools of oligos involved in a particular assembly were isolated , thus partially avoiding cross - hybridization .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite used predesigned barcodes to amplify subpools of oligos , and in a second step removed the barcodes by digestion . in another approach , the microarray was physically divided in sub - arrays that enabled performing amplification and assembly separately in each microwell  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : gblock ]     [ fig : oepcr ]      despite having elaborate biochemical error removal processes in place , some residual errors tend to remain in the synthesized pool and additional errors arise during the assembly phase .",
    "a number of error - correction strategies have been reported in the literature  @xcite .",
    "many of the current error - removal techniques rely on dna mismatch recognition proteins .",
    "denaturation and re - hybridization steps lead to double - stranded dna with mismatches between erroneous bases and the corresponding correct bases .",
    "the disrupted sites are recognized and/or cleaved by mismatch recognition proteins .",
    "muts is a protein that binds unpaired bases and small dna loops ( i.e. , small unmatched substrings in dna that protrude from the double helix ) .",
    "after denaturation and re - hybridization , muts detects and binds the mismatched regions that are later removed by gel electrophoresis .",
    "this strategy reduces the error - rate to @xmath5 nucleotide per @xmath6 kb  @xcite .",
    "`` consensus shuffling '' is a variation of the muts method where mismatch - containing pieces are captured by column - immobilized muts proteins , and error - free fragments are eluted  @xcite . in other variations of this method",
    ", two homologs of muts immobilized in cellulose columns can reduce the error rate to @xmath7 nucleotides per kb at a very low cost  @xcite . on the other hand , in the muthls approach , muts binds unpaired bases , while the protein mutl links the muth endonuclease to the muts bound sites that cleave the erroneous heteroduplexes .",
    "the correct sequences are recovered by gel electrophoresis  @xcite .",
    "similarly , resolvases  @xcite and single - strand nucleases  @xcite may also be used to recognize and cleave mismatched sites in dna heteroduplexes .",
    "it is worth pointing out that cel endonuclease , its commercial version surveyor^tm^ nuclease ( transgenomic , inc . ) or a commercial cel - based enzymatic cocktail , errase , that recognizes and nicks at the base - substitution mismatch , is commonly used in practice due to its broad substrate specificity ; it can reduce the error rate up to @xmath5 nucleotide per @xmath8 kb  @xcite .    the introduction of next generation sequencing ( ngs ) platforms as high throughput purification methods opened new possibilities for error - free dna synthesis .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite combined a next - generation pyrosequencing platform with a robotic system to image and pick beads containing sequence - verified oligonucleotides .",
    "the estimated error rate using this approach is @xmath5 nucleotide error per @xmath9 kb .",
    "one limitation of this method is that the `` pick - and - place '' recovery system is not accurate enough , due to the small size of clonal beads , to satisfy the increasing demand for long length dna strands ( involving @xmath10 building blocks )  @xcite .",
    "a new ngs - based method was recently announced , where specific barcoded primers were used to amplify only those oligos with the correct sequence  @xcite .",
    "similarly , a new method termed `` sniper cloning '' has been reported in  @xcite . there , ngs platform beads containing sequence - verified oligonucleotides are recovered by `` shooting '' a laser pulse .",
    "this laser technology enables cost - effective , high throughput selective separation of correct fragments without cross - contamination .    as a parting note , we observe that even single substitution errors in the synthesis process may be detrimental for applications in biological and medical research .",
    "this is _ not the case _ for dna - based storage systems , where the dna strands are used as storage media which may have a non - negligible error rate .",
    "synthesis errors may be easily combated through the introduction of carefully designed parity - checks of the information strings , as will be discussed in subsequent sections .",
    "once desired information is stored in dna by synthesizing properly encoded heteroduplexes , it may be rewritten using classical _ dna editing _ techniques .",
    "dna editing is the process of adding very specific point mutations ( often with the precision of a few nucleotides ) or deleting and inserting dna substrings at tightly controlled locations . in the latter case",
    ", one needs to synthesize readily usable short - to - medium length dna fragments . for this purpose ,",
    "two techniques are commonly used : gblocks gene fragments  @xcite ( see integrated dna techologies ) as building blocks for insertion and deletion edits , and overlap - extension pcr ( oepcr )  @xcite as a means of adding the mutated blocks .",
    "gblocks are double - stranded , precisely content - controlled dna blocks that may be used for applications as diverse as gene construction , pcr and qpcr control , recombinant antibody research , protein engineering , crispr - mediated genome editing and general medical research  @xcite .",
    "they are usually constructed at very low cost ( fraction of a dollar ) using _ gene fragments libraries _ ,",
    "i.e. , pools of short dna strings that contain up to @xmath11 consecutive bases of type n ( any nucleotide ) or k ( keto ) . the libraries and library products",
    "are carefully tested for correct length via capillary electrophoresis , sequence composition via mass spectrometry ; consensus protocols are used in the final verification stage to reduce any potential errors .",
    "the last stage , and additional quality control testing ensures that at least 80% of the generated pool contains the desired string . for strings with complex secondary structure",
    ", this percentage may be significantly lower .",
    "this calls for controlling the secondary structure of the products whenever the applications allows for it .",
    "such is the case for dna - based storage , and methods for designing dna codewords with no secondary structure ( predicted to the best extent possible via combinatorial techniques ) were described in  @xcite .",
    "dna substring editing is frequently performed via specialized pcr reactions .",
    "of particular use in dna rewriting is the process of oepcr , illustrated in figure  [ fig : oepcr ] . in oepcr , one uses two primers to flank two ends of the string to be edited . for fragment deletion ( splicing ) , the flanking primers act like zippers that need to join over the segment to be sliced .",
    "furthermore , the primer at the end to be joined is designed so that it has an overhanging part complementary to the overhanging part of the other primer . via controlled hybridization",
    ", the dna strands are augmented by a dna insert that is also complementary to the underlying dna strand . upon completion of this extension",
    ", classical pcr amplification is performed for the elongated sequence primers and the inserted overlapping fragments of the sequences are fused .",
    "note that this method does not requiring restriction sites or enzymes .",
    "oepcr is mostly used to insert oligonucleotides of lengths longer than @xmath12 nucleotides . in oepcr the sequence being modified is used to make two modified strands with the mutation at opposite ends , using the method outlined above .",
    "after denaturation , the strands are mixed , leading to different hybridization products .",
    "of all the products , only one will allow for polymerase extension via the introduction of a primer  the heterodimer without overlap at the 5 end .",
    "the duplex created by the polymerase is denatured once again and another primer is hybridized to the created dna strand , introducing a sequence contained in the first primer .",
    "dna replication consequently results in an extended sequence containing the desired insert .",
    "[ fig : sanger ]",
    "the goal of dna sequencing is to read the dna content , i.e. , to determine the exact nucleotides and their order in a dna molecule .",
    "such information is critical in understanding both basic biology and human diseases as well as for developing nature - inspired computational platforms .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite first developed sequencing methods to sequence dna based on chain termination ( see figure  [ fig : sanger ] for an illustration ) .",
    "this technique , which is commonly referred to as sanger sequencing , has been widely used for several decades and it is still being used routinely in numerous laboratories .",
    "the automated and parallelized approaches of sanger sequencing directly led to the success of the human genome project  @xcite and the genome sequencing projects of other important model organisms for biomedical research ( e.g. , mouse  @xcite ) .",
    "the availability of these entire genomes has provided scientists with unprecedented opportunities to make novel discoveries for genome architecture and genome function , trajectory of genome evolution , and molecular bases of phenotypic variation and disease mechanisms .",
    "however , in the past decade , the development of faster , cheaper , and higher - throughput sequencing technologies has dramatically expanded the reach of genomic studies .",
    "these `` next - generation sequencing '' ( ngs ) technologies , as opposed to sanger sequencing which is considered as first - generation , have been one of the most disruptive modern technological advances . in general",
    ", the ngs technologies have several major differences when compared to sanger sequencing .",
    "first , electrophoresis is no longer needed for reading the sequencing output ( i.e. , substring lengths ) which is now typically detected directly .",
    "second , more straightforward library preparations that do not use dna clones have become a critical part of sequencing workflow .",
    "third , tremendously large number of sequencing reactions are generated in parallel with ultra - high throughput .",
    "a demonstration of the significant ngs technology development is the cost reduction . around the year 2001 ,",
    "the cost of sequencing a million base - pairs was about $ 5,000 ; but it only costs about $ 0.05 in mid 2015 ( http://www.genome.gov/sequencingcosts/ ) . in other words , it will cost less than $ 5,000 to sequence an entire human genome with @xmath2x coverage .",
    "this cost keeps dropping every few months due to new developments in sequencing technology .",
    "however , a clear shortcoming of ngs versus sanger technologies has been data quality .",
    "the read lengths are much shorter and the error rate is higher as compared to sanger sequencing .",
    "for instance , the read length from illumina sequencing platforms ranges from @xmath13bps to @xmath14bps , making subsequent genome assembly extremely difficult , especially for genomes with a large proportion of repetitive elements / substrings .",
    "the error - rates of latest illumina sequencing platforms , such as hiseq 2500 are less than @xmath15 , and the errors are highly non - uniformly distributed along the sequenced reads : the terminal 20@xmath16 of nucleotides have orders of magnitude higher error - rates than the remaining @xmath17 of initial bases .",
    "the first ngs platform was introduced by @xmath18 life sciences ( acquired by roche in @xmath19 ) .",
    "although roche will shut down @xmath18 in @xmath20 , @xmath18 platforms have made significant contributions to both ngs technology development and biological applications , including the first full genome of a human individual using ngs  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18 platform utilizes pyrosequencing . briefly , pyrosequencing operates as follows .",
    "dna samples are first fragmented randomly . then each fragment is attached to a bead and emulsion pcr is used to make each bead contain many copies of the initial fragment .",
    "the sequencing machine contains numerous picoliter - volume wells , each containing a bead . in pyrosequencing ,",
    "luciferase is used to produce light , initiated by pyrophosphate when a nucleotide is incorporated at each cycle during sequencing .",
    "one drawback of @xmath18 sequencing is that multiple incorporation events occur in homopolymers .",
    "therefore , as the length of a homopolymer is reflected by the light intensity , a number of sequencing errors arise in connection with homopolymers .",
    "we remark that such errors were accounted for in a number of dna - storage implementations , even those using other sequencing platforms which typically do not introduce homopolymer errors .",
    "the solid planform , developed by applied biosystems ( merged with invitrogen to become life technologies in @xmath21 ) , was introduced in @xmath19 .",
    "solid uses sequencing by ligation ; i.e. , unlike @xmath18 , dna ligase is used instead of polymerase to identify nucleotides . during sequencing , a pool of possible oligonucleotides of a certain length",
    "are labeled according to the sequenced position .",
    "these oligonucleotides are ligated by dna ligase for matching sequences . before sequencing",
    ", the dna is amplified using emulsion pcr .",
    "each of the resulting beads contains single copies of the same dna molecule .",
    "the output of solid is in color space format , an encoded form of the nucleotide sequences with four colors representing @xmath22 combinations of two adjacent bases .",
    "the most frequently used sequencing platform so far has been illumina .",
    "it s sequencing technology was developed by solexa , which was acquired by illumina in @xmath19 .",
    "the method is mainly based on reversible dye - terminators that allow the identification of nucleotide bases when they are introduced into dna strands .",
    "dna samples are first randomly fragmented and primers are ligated to both ends of the fragments .",
    "they are then attached on the surface of the flow cell and amplified  in a process also known under the name bridge amplification  so that local clonal dna colonies , called `` dna clusters '' , are created . to determine each nucleotide base in the fragments , sequencing by synthesis",
    "is utilized .",
    "a camera takes images of the fluorescently labeled nucleotides to enable base calling .",
    "subsequently , the dye , along with the terminal 3 blocker , is removed from the dna to allow for the next cycle to begin with multiple iterations.the most frequently encountered errors in illumina data are simple substitution errors .",
    "much less common are deletion and insertion errors , and there is an indication that sequencing error rates are higher in regions in which there are homopolymers exceeding lengths @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "substitution errors arise when nucleotides are incorporated at different positions in the fragments of a cluster during the same cycle .",
    "they are also caused by clusters from more than one dna fragment , resulting in mixed signals during the base calling step .",
    "illumina sequencers have been used in numerous ngs applications , ranging from whole - genome sequencing , whole - exome sequencing , to rna sequencing , chip sequencing and others .",
    "the illumina hiseq 2500 system can generate up to @xmath24 billion single - end reads ( in @xmath25 bp ) per flow cell with @xmath26 lanes .",
    "the recently announced hiseq @xmath27 system can produce up to @xmath28 billion single - end reads per flow cell .",
    "in addition , several other types of sequencing technologies have been developed in recent years , with the pacific biosciences ( pacbio ) single - molecule real time ( smrt ) technology and the oxford nanopore s nanopore sequencing systems being the most promising ones . in smrt ,",
    "no amplification is needed and the sequencer observes enzymatic reaction in real time .",
    "it is also sometimes referred as `` third - generation sequencing '' because it does not require any amplification prior to sequencing .",
    "the most significant advantage of pacbio data is the much longer read length as compared to other ngs technologies .",
    "smrt can achieve read lengths exceeding @xmath6 kbases , making it more desirable for finishing genome assemblies .",
    "another advantage is speed  run times are much faster .",
    "however , the cost of pacbio sequencing is fairly high , amounting to a few dollars per million base - pairs .",
    "furthermore , smrt error rates are significantly higher than those of illumina sequencers and the throughput is much lower as well .",
    "oxford nanopore is considered another third - generation technology .",
    "its approach is based on the readout from eletrical signals when a single - stranded dna sequence passes through a nanoscale hole made from proteins or synthetic materials .",

    "the notion of mutual uncorrelatedness may be relaxed by requiring that only sufficiently long prefixes do not match sufficiently long suffixes of other sequences .",
    "sequences with this property , and at sufficiently large hamming distance , eliminate undesired address cross - hybridization during selection .",
    "mutually uncorrelated codes were studied by many authors under a variety of names .",
    "levenshtein first introduced them in 1964 under the name ` strongly regular codes ' @xcite , suggesting that the codes are interesting for synchronisation applications .",
    "inspired by the use of distributed sequences in frame synchronisation applications by van wijngaarden and willink @xcite , baji and stojanovi @xcite recently independently rediscovered mutually uncorrelated codes using the term cross - bifix - free ( see also  @xcite for recent papers and the references therein ) .",
    "the maximum size of a set of mutually uncorrelated code has been determined up to a constant factor by blackburn  @xcite .",
    "we state his result below .",
    "we point to an interesting construction by bilotta _",
    "_ @xcite and provide a simple modification to obtain a set of sequences satisfying c1 and c3 . to do so",
    ", we introduce a simple combinatorial object called a _",
    "dyck word_. a dyck word is a binary string consisting of @xmath123 zeroes and @xmath123 ones such that no prefix of the word has more zeroes than ones .    by definition ,",
    "a dyck word necessarily starts with a one and ends with a zero .",
    "consider a set @xmath203 of dyck words of length @xmath204 and define the following set of words of length @xmath205 , @xmath206 bilotta _ et al .",
    "_ demonstrated that @xmath155 is a mutually uncorrelated set of sequences .",
    "a dyck word has height at most @xmath161 if for any prefix of the word , the difference between the number of ones and the number of zeroes is at most @xmath161 .",
    "in other words , a dyck word has height at most @xmath161 if it has @xmath161-brds .",
    "let dyck@xmath207 denote the number of dyck words of length @xmath204 and height at most @xmath161 .",
    "de bruijn _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proved that for fixed values of @xmath161 , @xmath208 here , @xmath209 means that @xmath210 .",
    "as with bilotta _",
    ", we observe that if we prepend dyck words of length @xmath204 and height at most @xmath161 by @xmath5 , we obtain a mutually uncorrelated @xmath211-brds set of binary words of length @xmath205 . as before , we map 0 and 1 into @xmath212 and @xmath213 , respectively , and obtain a mutually uncorrelated @xmath211-gcpb set of sequences .      as already pointed out , it is an open problem to determine the largest number of address sequences that jointly satisfy the constraints c1 to c4 .",
    "we conjecture that the number of such sequences is exponential in @xmath100 , since the number of words that satisfy c1+c2 , c3 , and c1+c3 separately is exponential ( see theorems [ thm : m1],[thm : m2 ] , [ thm : m3 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the number of words that avoid secondary structures was also shown to be exponentially large by milenkovic and nashyap @xcite .",
    "thus far , we described how to construct address sequences that may serve as unique identifiers of the blocks they are associated with .",
    "we also pointed out that once such address sequences are identified , user information has to be encoded so as to _ avoid _ the appearance of any of the addresses , sufficiently long substrings of the addresses , or substrings similar to the addresses in the resulting codewords .",
    "specifically , for a fixed set @xmath155 of address sequences of length @xmath100 , we define the set @xmath156 to be the set of sequences of length @xmath157 such that each sequence in @xmath156 does not contain any string belonging to @xmath155 . therefore , by definition , when @xmath217 , the set @xmath156 is simply the set of strings of length @xmath157 .",
    "our objective is then to design an efficient encoding algorithm ( one - to - one mapping ) to encode a set @xmath218 of messages into @xmath156 . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we let @xmath219 and as is usual with constrained coding , we hope to maximize @xmath220 .",
    "clearly , @xmath221 and hence , it is of interest to determine the size of @xmath156 . in the case , when @xmath155 is a set of mutually uncorrelated strings , yazdi _ et al._@xcite proved the following theorem .",
    "we make certain observations on .",
    "when @xmath172 is fixed , it is easy to show that @xmath225 has only one pole with radius less than one for sufficiently large @xmath100 . furthermore , if @xmath226 is the pole of @xmath227 , we can show that @xmath228 with @xmath229 . here , the asymptotic is computed with respect to @xmath100 . in other words , for the case where @xmath172 is fixed , the size of @xmath156 is at least @xmath230 ( here , asymptotic is computed with respect to @xmath157 ) .    in the case where @xmath155 contains a single address @xmath168 , morita _ et al . _",
    "proposed efficient encoding schemes into @xmath231 in the context of prefix - synchronized codes @xcite .",
    "based on the scheme of morita _ et al .",
    "_ , yazdi _ et al .",
    "_ developed another encoding method that encodes messages into @xmath156 where @xmath155 contains more than one address . in this scheme ,",
    "et al._assume that @xmath155 is mutually uncorrelated and all sequences in @xmath155 end with the same base , which we assume without loss of generality to be @xmath162 .",
    "we then pick an address @xmath232 and define the following entities for @xmath233 , @xmath234    in addition , assume that the elements of @xmath235 are arranged in increasing order , say using the lexicographical ordering @xmath236 .",
    "we subsequently use @xmath237 to denote the @xmath238-th smallest element in @xmath239 , for @xmath240 .",
    "for example , if @xmath241 then @xmath242 and @xmath243      for an integer @xmath246 and @xmath247 , let @xmath248 be a length-@xmath157 ternary representation of @xmath249 .",
    "conversely , for each @xmath250 , let @xmath251 be the integer @xmath249 such that @xmath252 we proceed to describe how to map every integer @xmath253 into a sequence of length @xmath157 in @xmath156 and vice versa .",
    "we denote these functions as @xmath254 and @xmath255 , respectively .",
    "in their experiment , yazdi _ et al .",
    "_ found a set @xmath155 of @xmath258 address sequences of length @xmath136 and used this method to encode information into @xmath259 . in this instance , the value of @xmath260 bits , while the size of @xmath261 is @xmath262 bits .",
    "the previously described @xmath263 algorithm imposes no limitations on the length of a prefix used for encoding .",
    "this feature may lead to unwanted cross hybridization between address primers used for selection and the prefixes of addresses encoding the information .",
    "one approach to mitigate this problem is to perturb long prefixes in the encoded information in a controlled manner . for",
    "small - scale random access / rewriting experiments , the recommended approach is to first select all prefixes of length greater than some predefined threshold .",
    "afterwards , the first and last quarter of the bases of these long prefixes are used unchanged while the central portion of the prefix string is cyclically shifted by half of its length .",
    "for example , for the address primer @xmath264 , if the prefix @xmath265 appears as a subword , say @xmath266 , in @xmath267 then @xmath185 is modified to @xmath268 by mapping @xmath266 to @xmath269 .",
    "this process of shifting is illustrated below :    @xmath270 for an arbitrary choice of the addresses , this scheme may not allow for unique decoding @xmath263 .",
    "however , there exist simple conditions that can be checked to eliminate primers that do not allow this transform to be `` unique '' .",
    "given the address primers created for our random access / rewriting experiments , we were able to uniquely map each modified prefix to its original prefix and therefore uniquely decode the readouts .",
    "as a final remark , we would like to point out that prefix - synchronized coding also supports error detection and limited error - correction .",
    "error - correction is achieved by checking if each substring of the sequence represents a prefix or `` shifted '' prefix of the given address sequence and making proper changes when needed .",
    "* _ substitution errors introduced during synthesis .",
    "_ these errors may be addressed using many classical coding schemes , such as reed - solomon and low - density parity - check coding methods  @xcite .",
    "one non - trivial problem associated with substitution errors introduced during the synthesis phase arises after high - throughput sequencing . in this case",
    ", errors in the synthesized sequences propagate through a number of reads produced during sequencing , and hence correspond to a previously unknown class of burst errors .",
    "the authors addressed this issue in a companion paper  @xcite , where they introduced the notion of _ dna profile codes _ , which have the property that they can correct combinations of sequencing and synthesis errors in reads , in addition to missing coverage ( i.e. , missing read errors ) . *",
    "_ single deletion errors introduced during synthesis .",
    "_ isolated single deletion errors may be corrected by using levenshtein - tenengolts codes  @xcite , directly encoded into the dna string .",
    "it also appears possible to extend the dna profile coding paradigm to encompass deletion and insertion errors incurred during synthesis , although no results in this directions were reported . * _ substitution and coverage errors introduced during sequencing . _",
    "these errors may be handled in a similar manner as substitution errors introduced during synthesis , provided that they are used with the correct sequencing platform ( i.e. , illumina ) . for the third generation sequencing platforms - pacbio and oxford nanopore - only one specialized error - correction procedure",
    "was reported so far  @xcite , addressing problems arising due to overlapping impulse responses of two out of four bases ( see figure  [ fig : nanopores ] ) .",
