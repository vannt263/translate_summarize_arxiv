    "the calculus of variations can be used in the formulation of most of the physical problems . its origin was the famous problem of the _ brachistochrone _ , the curve of shortest descent time .",
    "johann bernoulli found that the curve solution to this problem is a cycloid , that is , the curve described by a point on the circumference of a circle that rolls along a straight line .",

    "its development was parallel to that of mechanics , geometrical optics , and elasticity . in this article",
    "we show how these problems can be related with the plateau problem , that is , the problem of finding the form that a soap film adopts for certain contour restrictions.@xmath2 we also show how to design simple experiments with soap films to find the solution to other variational problems such as a generalized steiner problem or the problem of the quickest approach .",
    "this article was inspired by reading the book  demonstrating science with soap films \" by d. lovett , in which a similar argument is used to generate the catenary .",
    "the paper can be useful for students and teachers of physics undergraduate courses .",
    "a complete study of this subject requires the use of the euler - lagrange equations .",
    "however , given the intuitive character of the analogies between mechanics , optics , and elasticity problems that we establish , together with the easy visualization of the solutions with soap films , this article may also be useful for students without knowledge of differential equations . in the appendix we propose a problem to use the concepts that appear in the article in a new situation .",

    "[ figure1 ]    johann bernoulli posed the problem of the brachistochrone as follows ( see figure  1 ) :    _ let two points @xmath5 and @xmath6 be given in a vertical plane . to find the curve that a point @xmath7 , moving on a path @xmath8 , must follow that , starting from @xmath5 , it reaches @xmath6 in the shortest time under its own gravity .",
    "_    denote by @xmath3 a curve joining @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and let us approximate this curve by a polygonal @xmath9 , such that the distance @xmath10 is very small , thus we can assume that the velocity along @xmath11 is constant and can be taken as the velocity of a heavy body after descending an altitude @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the gravity acceleration and @xmath12 is the ordinate of the midpoint between @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "then the total time of descent along the polygonal is given by : @xmath17 the total time of descent along @xmath3 , @xmath18 , is then obtained from this approximation , taking the limit as the length of the segments of the polygonal goes to @xmath19 , thus we obtain @xmath20    the problem is to find the curve @xmath3 that minimizes the above expression .",
    "the solution to this problem is given by solving a differential equation , known as euler - lagrange equation , whose solution is a cycloid .",
    "we are going to study a plateau problem that , from a mathematical point of view , is equivalent to the brachistochrone problem and , therefore , its solution is also the cycloid .     that aproximates the soap film bounded by the surfaces @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and two vertical segments .",

    "[ figure2 ]    consider two surfaces , one is the horizontal plane @xmath21 , and the other is defined by the equation @xmath22 ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "consider also two vertical segments @xmath23 and @xmath24 connecting the two surfaces .",
    "we propose the problem of finding the surface of minimal area , bounded by these two segments and the two surfaces .",
    "a surface with such characteristics is known in mathematics as a minimal surface . from the point of view of physics",
    ", the surface corresponds to a soap film .",
    "this follows from the fact that the soap film must minimize the elastic energy , what is equivalent to minimize the area of the surface .",

    "the area of the surface @xmath25 for a given curve @xmath3 is :    @xmath29    where the element of area @xmath30 is the product of the length element @xmath31 of the curve @xmath3 by @xmath32 ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "we observe that eqs .",
    "( [ brachis ] ) and  ( [ plateau ] ) are identical except for a constant factor .",
    "this means that the curve that minimizes the area @xmath33 , is the same curve that minimizes the time of descent @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , the solution curve is the same as for the brachistochrone problem , that is , a cycloid .",
    "figure  2 shows a representation of the surface @xmath25 and the cycloid @xmath3 .",
    "the parametric equations of the cycloid in the coordinates of the figure are : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be determined by the coordinates of the points @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",

    "we have used perspex sheets of 2 mm of thickness and the profiles have been made by laser cutting in a plastics workshop .",
    "the two transversal pins can be toothpicks or plastic wires .",
    "when our model is dipped into a soap solution , a soap film is formed between the two pins . incidentally ,",
    "if soap films between the pins and the lateral sides are also established , they should be removed by piercing with a stick .",
    "we have drawn on the base of our model , the cycloid that rolls over the @xmath41-axis and passing through the base points of the pins .",

    "we assume that each angle of the triangle @xmath51 is less than @xmath52 .    this problem , that has many industrial and commercial applications , has an experimental solution using soap films . to see this , consider the soap film limited by two parallel plates placed horizontally and three vertical pins .",
    "the soap film is composed of three vertical planes , which meet in a vertical edge over a point @xmath45 at angles of @xmath52 to each other , according to the second plateau law .",

    "the solution to this problem can be obtained experimentally by using soap films .",
    "for that , we only have to add to the perspex model described in section  [ our model ] a third vertical pin .",

    "the first is known as the problem of quickest approach , and the second is related with the isoperimetric problem .",
    "jakob enunciated the first problem in these terms ( see figure 6 ) :    _ on which of the infinitely many cycloids passing through @xmath53 , with the same base @xmath54 , can a heavy body fall from @xmath53 to a given vertical line @xmath55 in the shortest time ? _     and with the same base @xmath54 .",

    "the soap film solution corresponds approximately to a vertical surface with base a cycloidal arc that meets the given vertical surface at an angle of @xmath58 .",

    "his brother johann , christiaan huygens , and gottfried leibniz found the curve solution , since then known as the catenary .    as a variational problem",

    "on the other hand , the area of the vertical surface @xmath25 , raised over a curve @xmath3 ( see figure  8) is given by @xmath72    since eqs .",

    "[ figure9 ]    if in our perspex model of section 2 we replace the top curved surface @xmath80 by the plane @xmath74 with slope @xmath81 ( see figure 3 ( b ) ) , the soap film formed between two vertical pins is approximately a vertical surface whose base curve is a catenary ( see figures  8 and  9 ) .",
    "there are two solutions corresponding to a minimum and a maximum of elastic energy , so the first solution is stable while the second is unstable .    in our case , for the vertical pins over the points @xmath75 and @xmath76 in cm , the two solutions calculated from eq .",

    "the soap film in the poincar half - plane model is specially interesting for visualizing geometric properties of the cosmological model of the universe associated to a matter density less than the critical , because in this case the space has negative constant curvature so that the poincar half - plane is a bidimensional model for this space .    here , as in the case of the cycloid",

    "we have seen that the problem of minimizing certain mechanical magnitudes is equivalent to minimizing the area of a surface connecting two pins between two appropriate surfaces .",
