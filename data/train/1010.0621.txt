    "recommender systems have become a core component for today s personalized online businesses @xcite . with the abilities of connecting various items ( e.g. , retailing products , movies , news articles , advertisements , experts ) to potentially interested users ,",
    "recommender systems enable online webshops ( e.g. amazon , netflix , yahoo ! ) to expand the marketing efforts from historically a few best - sellings toward a large variety of long - tail ( niche ) products @xcite .",
    "such abilities are endowed by a personalization algorithm for identifying the preference of each individual user , which is at the heart of a recommender system .",
    "predicting user preference is challenging .",
    "usually , the user and item spaces are very large yet the observations are extremely sparse . learning from such rare , noisy and largely missing evidences has a high risk of overfitting . indeed , this _ data sparseness _ issue has been widely recognized as a critical challenge for constructing effective recommender systems",
    ".    a straightforward way for building recommender would be to learn a user s preference based on the prior interactions between her and the recommender system .",
    "typically , such interaction is an ",
    "opportunity give - and - take \" process ( _ c.f .",
    "_ table  [ tab : example ] ) , where at each interaction :    a user @xmath0 inquires the system ( e.g. visits a movie recommendation web site ) ;    the system offers a set of ( personalized ) opportunities ( i.e.  items ) @xmath1 ( e.g. recommends a list of movies of potential interest to the user ) ;    the user chooses one item @xmath2 ( or more ) from these offers and takes actions accordingly ( e.g. click a link , rent a movie , view a news article , purchase a product ) .    somewhat surprisingly , this interaction process has not been fully - exploited for learning recommenders . instead ,",
    "research on recommender systems has focused almost exclusively on recovering user preference by completing the matrix of user actions @xmath3 while the actual contexts in which user decisions are made are totally disregarded . in particular ,",
    "collaborative filtering ( cf ) approaches only captures the action dyads @xmath3 while the contextual dyads ( i.e.  @xmath4 for all @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) are typically treated as missing data . for example , the rating - oriented models aim to approximating the ratings that users assigned to items @xcite ; the recently proposed ranking - oriented algorithms @xcite attempt to recover the ordinal ranking information derived from the ratings . although this formulation of the recommendation problem has led to numerous algorithms which excel at a number of data sets , including the prize - winning work of @xcite , we argue here that the formulation is inherently flawed  a preference for _ die hard _ given a generic set of movies only tells us that the user appreciates action movies ; however , a preference for _ die hard _ over _ terminator _ or _ rocky _ suggests that the user might favor bruce willis over other action heroes . in other words , the context of user choice is vital when estimating user preferences .",
    "when it comes to modeling of user - recommender interactions , an important question arises : what is the fundamental mechanism underlying the user choice behaviors ? as reflected by its name , collaborative filtering",
    "is based on the notion of  collaboration effects \" that _ similar items get similar responses from similar users_. this assumption is essential because by encoding the  collaboration \" among users or among items or both , cf greatly alleviates the issue of data sparseness and in turn makes more reliable predictions based on the somewhat _ pooled _ evidences across different items / users .",
    "it has long been recognized in psychology and economics that , besides the effect of collaboration @xcite , another mechanism governs users behavior  _ competition _ @xcite . in particular",
    ", items turn to compete with each other for the attention of users ; therefore , axiomatically , user @xmath0 will pick the best item @xmath7 ( i.e.  the one with highest utility ) when confronted by the set of alternatives @xmath8 .",
    "for example , consider a user with a penchant for action movies by arnold schwarzenegger . given the choice between",
    "_ sleepless in seattle _ and _ die hard _ he will likely choose the latter .",
    "however , when afforded the choice between the oeuvres of schwarzenegger , diesel or willis , he s clearly more likely to choose schwar - zenegger over the works of willis . to capture user s preference more accurately ,",
    "it is therefore _ essential _ for a recommender model to take into account such local competition effect .",
    "unfortunately , this effect is absent in a large number of collaborative filtering approaches .    in this paper ,",
    "we present competitive collaborative filtering ( ccf ) for learning recommender models by modeling users choice behavior in their interactions with the recommender system . similar to matrix factorization approaches for cf",
    ", we employ a multiplicative latent factor model to characterize the dyadic utility function ( i.e.  the utility of an item to a user ) . in this way",
    ", ccf encodes the collaboration effect among users and items similar to cf . but instead of learning only the action dyads ( i.e.  @xmath9 or the  1 \" entries in table  [ tab : example ] ) , ccf bases the factorization learning on the whole user - recommender interaction traces .",
    "it therefore leverages not only the action dyads ( @xmath10 ) but also the dyads in the context without user actions ( i.e.@xmath11 for all @xmath5 and @xmath6 or the dot entries in table  [ tab : example ] ) , which were treated as potentially missing data in cf approaches .    to leverage the entire interaction trace for latent factor learning",
    ", we devise probabilistic models or optimization objectives to encode the local competition effect underlying the user choice process .",
    "we present two formulations with different flavors .",
    "the first formulation is derived from the _ multinomial logit model _ that has been widely used for modeling user choice behavior ( e.g.  choice of brands ) in psychology @xcite , economics @xcite and marketing science @xcite .",
    "the second formulation relates closely to the ordinal regression models in content filtering @xcite ( e.g.  web search ranking ) . essentially , both formulations attempt to encodes",
    " local optimality of user choices \" to encourage that every opportunity @xmath7 taken by a user @xmath0 be locally the best in the context of the opportunities @xmath8 offered to her . from a machine learning viewpoint ,",
    "ccf is a hybrid of _ local _ and _ global _ learning , where a global matrix factorization model is learned by optimizing a local context - aware loss function .",
    "we discuss the implementation of ccf , establish efficient learning algorithms and deliver an package that allows distributed optimization on streaming data .",
    "experiments were conducted on three real - world recommendation data sets .",
    "first , on two dyadic data sets , we show that ccf improves over standard cf models by up to 50+% in terms of offline top-@xmath12 ranking . furthermore , on a commercial recommender system , we show that ccf significantly outperform cf models in both offline and online evaluations .",
    "in particular , ccf achieves up to 7% improvement in offline top-@xmath12 ranking and up to 13% in terms of online click rate prediction .",

    "consider the user - system interaction in a recommender system : we have users @xmath13 and items @xmath14 ; when a user @xmath0 visits the site , the system recommends a set of items @xmath15 and @xmath0 in turn chooses a ( possibly empty ) subset @xmath16 from @xmath8 and takes actions accordingly ( e.g.  buys some of the recommended products ) .",
    "for ease of explanation , let us temporarily assume @xmath17 , i.e.  @xmath18 is not empty and contains exactly one item @xmath7 .",
    "more general scenarios shall be discussed later .    to build the recommender system , we record a collection of historical interactions in the form of @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the index of a particular interaction session .",
    "our goal is to generate recommendations @xmath21 for an incoming visit @xmath22 of user @xmath23 such that the user s satisfaction is maximized .",

    "collaborative filtering is by far the most well - known method for modeling such dyadic responses .      in collaborative filtering",
    "we are given observations of dyadic responses @xmath31 with each @xmath32 being an observed response ( e.g.  user s rating to an item , or indication of whether user @xmath0 took an action on item @xmath33 ) .",
    "the whole mapping : @xmath34 constitutes a large matrix @xmath35 . while we might have millions of users and items , only a tiny proportion ( considerably less than 1% in realistic datasets ) of entries are observable .",
    "note the subtle difference in terms of the data representation : while we record entire sessions , cf only records the dyadic responses .",
    "collaborative filtering explores the notion of  collaboration effects \" , i.e. , similar users have similar preference to similar items . by encoding collaboration ,",
    "cf pools the sparse observations in such a way that for predicting @xmath28 it also borrows observations from other users / items . generally speaking ,",
    "existing cf methods fall into either of the following two categories .",
    "[ [ neighborhood - models . ] ] neighborhood models .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    a popular class of approaches to cf is based on propagating the observations of responses among items or users that are considered as neighbors .",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    this class of methods learn predictive latent factors to estimate the missing dyadic responses .",

    "this model implicitly encodes the aldous - hoover theorem @xcite for exchangeable matrices ",
    "@xmath32 are independent of each other given @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "in essence , it amounts to a low - rank approximation of the matrix @xmath43 that naturally embeds both users and items into a vector space in which the distances directly reflect the semantic relatedness .    to design a concrete model @xcite",
    ", one needs to specify a distribution for the dependence .",
    "afterwards , the model boils down to an optimization problem .",
    "for example two commonly - used formulations are :    the most popular learning formulation is to minimize the @xmath44 loss within an empirical risk minimization framework @xcite : @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the set of ( @xmath47 ) dyads for which the responses @xmath32 are observed , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are regularization weights .",
    "another popular formulation @xcite is to use logistic regression by optimizing the cross - entropy @xmath50      collaborative filtering approaches have made substantial progresses and are currently the state - of - the - art techniques for recommender system .",
    "however , we argue here that cf approaches might be a bit lacking in several aspects .",
    "first of all , although data sparseness is a big issue , cf does not fully leverage the wealth of user behavior data .",
    "take the user - recommender interaction process described in ",
    "[ sec : def ] as an example ( c.f .",
    "table  [ tab : example ] ) , cf methods typically use only the action dyad @xmath9 of each session while other dyads @xmath51 are treated missing and totally disregarded , which could be wasteful of the invaluable learning resource because these non - action dyads are not totally useless , as shown by the experiments in this paper .",
    "secondly , most existing cf approaches learn user preference collaboratively by either approximating the dyadic responses @xmath52 @xcite or preserving the ordinal ranking information derived from the dyadic responses @xcite ; none of them models the user choice behavior in recommender systems .",
    "particularly , as users choose from competing alternatives , there is naturally a local competition effect among items being offered in a session .",
    "our work show that this effect could be an important clue for learning user preference .    because latent factor models are very flexible and could be under - determined ( or over - parameterized ) even for rather moderate number of users / items . with the above two limitations , cf approaches are vulnerable to over - fitting @xcite .",
    "particularly , while most existing cf models might learn consistently on user ratings ( numerical value typically with five levels ) if given enough training data , they usually perform poorly on binary responses . for example , for the aforementioned interaction process ( _ c.f .",
    "_ table  [ tab : example ] ) , the response @xmath32 is typically a binary event indicating whether or not item @xmath33 was accepted by the user @xmath0 . with the non - action dyads being ignored ,",
    "the responses are exclusively positive observations ( either @xmath53 or missing ) . as a result",
    ", we will obtain an overly - optimistic estimator that biases toward positive responses and predicts positive for almost all the incoming dyads ( see  [ sec : dyad_exp ] for empirical evidences ) .",
    "we present a novel framework for recommender learning by modeling the system - user interaction process .",
    "the key insight is that the contexts @xmath26 in which user s decisions are made should be taken into account when learning recommender models . in practice ,",
    "a user @xmath0 could make different decisions when facing different contexts @xmath26 .",
    "for instance , an item @xmath33 would not have been chosen by @xmath0 if it were not presented to her at the first place ; likewise , user @xmath0 could choose another item if the context @xmath26 changes such that a better offer ( e.g. , a more interesting item ) is presented to her .    in this section ,",
    "we describe the framework of collaborative - competitive filtering .",
    "we start with some axiomatic views of the user choice behaviors . following that",
    ", we present the learning formulation of ccf .",
    "we then develop the optimization algorithms and implementation techniques .",
    "we close the section with a discussion of useful extensions .",
    "formally , the individual choice process ( i.e.  user - recommender interactions ) in a recommender system can be viewed as an instance of the _ opportunity give - and - take _ ( gat ) process .     _",
    "an opportunity give - and - take process is a process of interactions among an agent @xmath0 , a system @xmath54 and a set of opportunities @xmath25 ; at an interaction @xmath20 : _ note that we assume the agent is _ a priori _ not aware of all the items , and only through the recommender @xmath54 can she get to know the items , therefore other items that are not in @xmath26 is unaccessible to @xmath0 at interaction @xmath20 .",
    "this is reasonable considering that the number of item is usually very large .",
    "moreover , we assume an agent @xmath0 is a rational decision maker : she knows that her choice of item @xmath33 will be at the expense of others @xmath55 , therefore she compares among alternatives before making her choice .",
    "in other words , for each decision , @xmath0 considers both and , and decides which opportunity to take based on the potential of each opportunity in @xmath8 .",
    "specifically , the opportunity cost @xmath56 is the potential loss of @xmath0 from taking an opportunity @xmath33 that excludes her to take other opportunities : @xmath57 ; the profit @xmath58 is the net gain of an decision . by drawing the rational decision theory @xcite ,",
    "we present the following principle of individual choice behavior .     _",
    "a rational decision is a decision maximizing the profit : @xmath7 = @xmath59 . _",
    "this proposition implies the constraint of  local optimality of user choice \" , a local competitive effect restricting that the agent @xmath0 always chooses the offer that is locally optimal in the context of the offer set @xmath26 .",
    "the local - optimality principle induces a constraint which could be translated to an objective function for recommender learning : @xmath60    this objective is , however , problematic .",
    "first , the inequality constraint restricts the utility function only up to an arbitrary order - preserving transformation ( e.g.  a monotonically increasing function ) , and hence can not yield a unique solution ( e.g.  point estimation ) @xcite .",
    "second , optimization based on the induced objective is computationally intractable due to the @xmath61 operator . to this end",
    ", we present two surrogate objectives , which both are computationally efficient and show close connections to existing models .",
    "our first formulation is based on the random utility theory @xcite which has been extensively used for modeling choice behavior in economics @xcite and marketing science @xcite . in particular",
    ", we assume the utility function consists of two components @xmath62 , where : ( 1 ) @xmath63 is a deterministic function characterizing the intrinsic interest of user @xmath0 to item @xmath33 , for which we use the latent factor model to quantify @xmath64 ; ( 2 ) the second part @xmath65 is a stochastic error term reflecting the uncertainty and complexness of the choice process .",
    "furthermore , we assume the error term @xmath65 is an independently and identically distributed weibull ( extreme point ) variable : @xmath66    together with the local - optimality principle , these two constraints yield the following _ multinomial logit model _ @xcite : @xmath67 intuitively , this model enforces the local - optimality constraint by using the _ softmax _ function as a surrogate of _",
    "max_.    given a collection of training interactions @xmath68 , the latent factors can be estimated using penalized maximum likelihood via @xmath69 -    \\phi_{u_t}^\\top \\phi_{i^*_t } \\\\",

    "@xmath63 as each of the objective terms in eq.([eq : softmax ] ) is strongly concave , it is nonconvex w.r.t .",
    "the latent factors @xmath70 .",
    "we postpone the discussion of optimization algorithms to  [ sec : op ] .",
    "our second formulation is based on a simple reduction of the local - optimality constraint .",
    "note that , from eq([eq : local ] ) , it follows that : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the average potential utility that @xmath0 could possibly gain from the non - chosen items .",
    "intuitively , the above model encourages that the utility difference between choice and non - chosen items , @xmath73 , to be nontrivially greater than random errors .",
    "based on this notion , we present the following formulation which views the task as a pairwise preference learning problem @xcite and uses the non - choices averagely as negative preferences . @xmath74 this formulation is directly related to the maximum score estimation @xcite of the multinomial logit model eq([eq : logit ] ) .",
    "intuitively , it directly reflects the insight that user decisions are usually made by comparing alternatives and considering the _ difference _ of potential utilities . in other words",
    ", it learns latent factors by maximizing the marginal utility between user choice and the average of non - choices .",
    "again , the optimization is convex w.r.t .",
    "@xmath63 , but nonconvex w.r.t .",
    "the latent factors , therefore the standard optimization tools such as the large variety of ranksvm @xcite solvers are not directly applicable .",
    "it is worth noting that our ccf formulations have an appealing linear complexity , @xmath75 , where the offer size @xmath76 is typically a very small number .",
    "for example , netflix recommends @xmath77 movies for each visit , and yahoo !",
    "frontpage highlights @xmath78 hot news for each browser .",
    "therefore , ccf has the same - order complexity as the rating - oriented cf models .",
    "note that the ranking - oriented cf approaches @xcite are much more expensive  for each user @xmath0 , the learning complexity is quadratic @xmath79 as they learn preference of each user by comparing every pair of the items .",
    "as we have already mentioned , due to the use of bilinear terms , both of the two ccf variants are nonconvex optimization problems regardless of the choice of the loss functions .",
    "while there _ are _ convex reformulations for some settings they tend to be computationally inefficient for large scale problems as they occur in industry  the convex formulations require the manipulation of a full matrix which is impractical for anything beyond thousands of users .    moreover , the interactions between user and items change over time and it is desirable to have algorithms which process this information incrementally .",
    "this calls for learning algorithms that are sufficiently efficient and preferably capable to update dynamically so as to reflect upcoming data streams , therefore excluding offline learning algorithms such as classical svd - based factorization algorithms @xcite or spectral eigenvalue decomposition methods @xcite that involve large - scale matrices .",
    "we use a distributed stochastic gradient variant with averaging based on the hadoop mapreduce framework .",
    "the basic idea is to decompose the objectives in or by running stochastic optimization on sub - blocks of the interaction traces in parallel in the map phase , and to combine the results for @xmath42 in the reduce phase .",
    "the basic structure is analogous to @xcite .",

    "the algorithm is computationally efficient and decouplable among different interactions and users , therefore amenable for parallel implementation .",
    "the algorithm loops over all the observations and updates the parameters by moving in the direction defined by negative gradient .",
    "specifically , we can carry out the following update equations on each machine separately :    for all @xmath80 do @xmath81 .    for each @xmath0",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    a key challenge in learning ccf models on large - scale data is that the storage of parameters as well as observable features requires a large amount of memory and a reverse index to map user ids to memory locations .",
    "in particular in recommender systems with hundreds of millions of users the memory requirement would easily exceed what is available on today s computers ( 100 million users with 100 latent feature dimensions each amounts to 40 gb of ram ) .",
    "we address this problem by implementing feature hashing @xcite on the space of matrix elements . in",
    "particularly , by allowing random collisions and applying hash mapping to the latent factors ( i.e.@xmath70 ) , we keep the entire representation in memory , thus greatly accelerating optimization .",
    "we now discuss two extensions of ccf to address the fact that in some cases users choose not to respond to an offer at all and that moreover we may have observed features in addition to the latent representation discussed so far .      in establishing the ccf framework for modeling the user choice behavioral data , we assumed that for each user - system interaction @xmath20 , the decision set @xmath27 contains at least one item .",
    "this assumption is , however , not true in practice . a user s visit at a recommender system does not always yields an action .",
    "for example , users frequently visit online e - commerce website without making any purchase , or browse a news portal without clicking on an ad .",
    "actually , such nonresponded visits may account for a vast majority of the traffics that an recommender system receives .",
    "moreover , different users may have different propensities for taking an action . here , we extend the multinomial logit model to modeling both responded and nonresponded interactions , @xmath89 and @xmath90 respectively .",
    "this is accomplished by adding a scalar @xmath91 for each user @xmath0 to capture the _ action threshold _ of user @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that , at an interaction @xmath20 , user @xmath92 takes an effective action only if she feels that the overall quality of the offers @xmath26 are good enough and worth the spending of her attention . in keeping with the logistic model",
    "this means that @xmath93 for all @xmath94 and the probability of no response is given by the remainder , that is by @xmath95 .",

    "research on recommender systems has focused almost exclusively on learning the dyadic data .",
    "particularly collaborative filtering approaches only capture the user - item dyadic data with explicit user actions while the context dyads are typically treated missing values .",
    "for example , the rating - oriented models aim to approximating the ratings that users assigned to items @xcite ; whereas the recently proposed ranking - oriented algorithms @xcite attempt to recover the ordinal ranking information derived from the ratings .    by exploiting past records of user - item dyadic responses for future prediction based on either _ neighborhood based _",
    "@xcite or _ latent factor based _ methods @xcite , collaborative filtering approaches encode the collaboration effect that similar users get similar preference on similar items . in this paper , by leveraging the user - recommender interaction data , we show that much better recommender performance can be obtained when a local - competition effect underlying the user choice behaviors is also encoded .    the multinomial logit model we present is derived based on the random utility theory @xcite .",
    "the model is well - established and has been widely used for a long time in , e.g.psychology @xcite , economics @xcite and marketing science @xcite .",
    "particularly , @xcite applied the model to examine the brand choice of households on grocery data ; @xcite showed this model is theoretically and empirically superior to the @xmath44 regression model .",
    "more recently , the pioneering work of @xcite first applied the model to characterize online choices in recommender system and investigated how recommender systems impact sales diversity . following these steps , this work further employs the model to learn factorization models for recommendation .",
    "the hinge formulation of ccf shows close connection to the pairwise preference learning approaches widely used in web search ranking @xcite .",
    "our model , however , differs from these content filtering models @xcite in that instead of learning a feature mapping as in @xcite , our model uses the formulation for learning a multiplicative latent factor model .",
    "we presented a framework for learning recommender by modeling user choice behavior in the user - system interaction process .",
    "instead of modeling only the sparse binary events of user actions as in traditional collaborative filtering , the proposed collaborative - competitive filtering models take into account the contexts in which user decisions are made .",
    "we presented two models in this spirit , established efficient learning algorithms and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approaches with extensive experiments on three large - scale real - world recommendation data sets .",
    "when deriving the ccf model , we admit an assumption that user decides whether to take an offer solely based on the comparison of utilities .",
    "this assumption , however , neglects a factor which might be important in practice .",
    "in particular , a user might have budgeted attention such that when making choices he only pays attention to a few top - ranked items and totally disregard the others .",
    "this _ position bias _ is evident in both web search ranking and recommendation .",
    "we plan to take this into consideration for building choice models .",
    "a key feature of the current paper is that we assume the recommender adopts a deterministic strategic policy when making recommendations . in practice",
    ", a recommender could also adaptively react to the users actions as well as its own considerations ( e.g.  inventory constraints , promotion requirement of certain brands ) .",
    "we would like to extend our analysis here to model the interactive process between users and recommender .",
    "due to data collection constraints , some parts of the proposed models are not strictly evaluated in the current paper .",
    "we plan to refine the mechanism for data collection and conduct experiments for further experiments .",
