    "many natural or man - made phenomena have both a spatial and a temporal extent .",
    "consider for example a forest fire , a meteorological event ( e.g. , the movement of clouds pressure areas ) , property histories in a city or the flight of an air plane .",
    "to store information about such phenomena in a database , appropriate data modeling constructs are needed .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce and discuss a general framework for specifying spatio - temporal data .",
    "hereto , the new concept of spatio - temporal object is introduced .",
    "we represent a spatio - temporal object as a finite number of objects represented by means of a spatial reference object , a temporal object ( i.e. , a time interval ) and a time - dependent geometric transformation that determines how this spatial object moves or changes through space during the considered time interval .",
    "although this model is suited for data in arbitrary dimensions , we focus on two - dimensional reference objects that move or change during time .    in this framework ,",
    "a number of classes of practically relevant spatio - temporal objects arise naturally .",
    "these classes are indexed by the type of spatial reference object and the type of transformation functions that are allowed . on the level of reference objects , we consider polygons , triangles , triangles with two sides parallel to the coordinate axes of the two - dimensional plane and rectangles with all sides parallel to the coordinate axes .",
    "we consider time - dependent affinities , scalings and translations for what concerns transformation functions .",
    "these functions can be expressed by rational , polynomial , respectively linear functions .",
    "we investigate these classes with respect to closure under boolean set operations , namely union , intersection and set - difference .    by definition",
    ", these classes are closed under union ( a spatio - temporal object is described as the union of atomic objects ) .",
    "we call a class closed under intersection ( respectively set - difference ) if any finite intersection ( respectively set - difference ) of objects from a class can again be described by an object from that class ( i.e. , as a union of atomic objects ) .",
    "the classes that we consider are not necessarily closed under intersection and set - difference .",
    "we provide an in - depth and exhaustive study of their closure with respect to all set - theoretic operations , and we conclude that our model for representing spatio - temporal data gives very poor closure results for the classes of objects we considered important for spatio - temporal practice .",
    "the only classes that seems to be useful in this respect have polygons as spatial reference objects and use rational affinities to move or change these objects in time .",
    "a conclusion is that we have to enrich the data model by allowing set - theoretic operations other than union in the construction of geometric objects from atomic geometric objects .",
    "as soon as we also allow spatio - temporal objects to be constructed from atomic ones by means of union and intersection ( or union and set - difference ) then the model becomes closed for _ all _ boolean set operations .",
    "indeed , as an important result , we show that our classes , that are drawn from practice , have the nice property that they are closed under intersection if and only if they are closed under set - difference .    to appreciate the need for applying set - theoretic operators to spatiotemporal objects , consider the following scenario .",
    "let two spatial objects represent the extents of the safe areas around two different ships .",
    "taking into account the movement of ships , the extents of the safe areas over a period of time can be represented as two spatiotemporal objects . to avoid collisions",
    ", one needs to be able to determine the intersection of those objects .",
    "the substantial literature on spatial and temporal databases does not provide much guidance in dealing with spatiotemporal phenomena .",
    "spatial databases  @xcite deal with spatial objects ( e.g. , rectangles or polygons ) and temporal databases  @xcite with temporal ones ( e.g. , time intervals )",
    ". their combination can handle _ discrete _ change  @xcite but not _ continuous _ change , which is required by applications dealing with phenomena like movement , natural disasters , or the growth of urban areas . in the latter applications ,",
    "the temporal and spatial aspects can not be conveniently separated .",
    "spatiotemporal data models and query languages are a topic of growing interest .",
    "the need to model both discrete and continuous change has been identified .",
    "the issue of closure under boolean set operations has also received in this context a considerable attention .",
    "this is not surprising , since , for example , closure under intersection is essential for _ spatiotemporal join_.    the paper  @xcite presents one of the first such models .",
    "however , it is only capable of modeling discrete change .    in @xcite",
    "the authors define in an abstract way _ moving points and regions_. apart from moving points , no other classes of concrete , database - representable spatiotemporal objects are defined . in",
    "that approach continuous movement ( but not growth or shrinking ) can be modeled using linear interpolation functions . in the subsequent paper @xcite",
    ", the authors discuss a concrete , polyhedral representation of _ moving _ , _ growing _ and _ shrinking regions _ , which is applicable only to significantly restricted classes of spatiotemporal objects .",
    "this guarantees closure but eliminates the possibility of representing scaling and more general transformations .",
    "the results of the present paper shed some light on when similar concrete representations exist and when they do not .",
    "in @xcite the authors propose a formal spatiotemporal data model based on _ constraints _ in which , like in  @xcite , only discrete change can be modeled . an sql - based query language is also presented .",
    "we have proposed elsewhere @xcite a spatiotemporal data model based on _ parametric polygons _ : polygons whose vertices are defined using linear functions of time .",
    "this model is also capable of modeling continuous change but is not closed under intersection .",
    "a variation of this model restricted to rectangles but extended with periodic functions is given in  @xcite .",
    "the latter model is closed under set theoretic operators , enabling the definition of an extended relational algebra query language , for which query evaluation can be done in ptime in the size of the input spatiotemporal database .",
    "the closure properties for @xcite and @xcite seem analoguous to the closure properties of the framework presented in this paper , respectively , but the relationships among these frameworks needs to be further explored .",
    "both discrete and continuous change can be represented using _ constraint databases _ @xcite .",
    "compared to the latter technology , our approach seems more constructive and amenable to implementation using standard database techniques . on the other hand",
    ", constraint databases do not suffer from the lack of closure under intersection . to some degree , it is due to the fact that the intersection of two generalized tuples in constraint databases need not immediately computed but rather the tuples may be only conjoined together . in most implementations of constraint databases  @xcite the `` real '' computation of the intersection occurs during projection or the presentation of the query result to the user .",
    "it is unclear whether such a strategy offers any computational advantages over the approach in which the intersections are computed immediately .",
    "in fact , recent work on spatial constraint databases @xcite proposes extensions to relational algebra that require immediate computations of spatial object intersections . also , our approach is potentially more general than constraint databases .",
    "for example , by moving beyond rational functions ( but keeping the same basic framework ) we can represent rotations with a fixed center .",
    "finally , in our model it is easy to obtain any snapshot of a spatiotemporal object , making tasks like animation straightforward .",
    "it is not so in constraint databases where geometric representations of snapshots have to be explicitly constructed from constraints  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we give definitions and describe the relevant classes of spatio - temporal objects .",
    "the closure results for these classes with respect to boolean set operations are given in section 3 .",
    "we propose the extended model in section 4 and describe a normal form for objects in this extended model .",
    "section 5 gives comments and concludes the paper .",
    "in this section , we define the notion of _ spatio - temporal object_. in our approach , a spatio - temporal object consists of a spatial reference object , a time interval during which the spatio - temporal object exists and a continuous transformation that defines how the spatial reference object moves and changes during the interval of time .",
    "let @xmath0 be the set of real numbers and @xmath1 be the @xmath2-dimensional real plane .",
    "[ defobj]a _ spatial object _ is a subset of @xmath1 .",
    "a _ temporal object _ is a subset of @xmath0 ( we assume a single temporal dimension ) .",
    "a _ spatio - temporal object _ is a subset of @xmath3 .",
    "these definitions are very general and disregard the fact that objects should be finitely representable in the computer s memory . in this paper , we will study more restricted classes of spatial and spatio - temporal objects that are important from a practical point of view and have simple and efficient representations .",
    "such classes have been identified in the course of spatial and spatio - temporal database research .    here , we propose a geometric approach : a spatio - temporal object is defined as a spatial reference object together with a continuous transformation that defines how the object moves or changes during some time interval .",
    "an _ atomic geometric object @xmath4 _ is a triple @xmath5 , where    * @xmath6 is the _ spatial reference object _ of @xmath4 , which is semi - algebraic is a boolean combination of sets of the form @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a polynomial with integer coefficients in the real variables @xmath9 , @xmath10 , ... , @xmath11 . ] in @xmath1 ; * @xmath12 is the _ time domain _ of @xmath4 , which is a connected and bounded semi - algebraic set in @xmath0 ( i.e. , a point or a bounded interval ) ; and * @xmath13 is the _ transformation function _ of @xmath14 , which is semi - algebraic is said to be semi - algebraic if its graph is a semi - algebraic subset of @xmath15 . ] and continuous both in the time coordinate and in the spatial coordinates .",
    "the semantics of an atomic geometric object @xmath16 is the spatio - temporal object @xmath17    we remark that this definition guarantees that there is a finite representation of an atomic geometric object by means of the polynomial inequalities that describe its reference object , its time domain and the graph of its transformation function .",
    "this means that this data model is within the _ constraint model _ for databases ( we refer to @xcite for an overview of the research results in this area ) .",
    "a _ geometric object _ is a finite set of atomic geometric objects .",
    "the semantics of a geometric object @xmath18 is the union of the semantics of the atomic objects that constitute it , i.e. , the set @xmath19    we agree that whenever we write `` the spatio - temporal object @xmath14 '' , where @xmath4 is an ( atomic ) geometric object , we mean the semantics of the ( atomic ) geometric object @xmath4 . also , when @xmath16 is an atomic object and @xmath20 , we will refer to the set @xmath21 as the _ frame of @xmath22 at time @xmath23 _ and we will denote it @xmath24 .",
    "we define the _ time domain _ of a geometric object to be the smallest time interval that contains all the time domains of the composing atomic geometric objects .",
    "recall that the smallest interval containing a set of intervals is also known as the convex closure of this set .",
    "we denote the convex closure of the sets @xmath25 , @xmath26 , ... , @xmath27 by @xmath28 .",
    "remark that a spatio - temporal object is empty ( or non - existing ) outside the time domain of the geometric object that defines it .",
    "also , within its time domain a spatio - temporal object can be empty ( for instance , at any moment when no atomic geometric object exists ) .",
    "we conclude this section by remarking that the above introduced notions of spatial and spatio - temporal object and of ( atomic ) geometric object can be generalized to arbitrary dimension @xmath29 ( by simply substituting @xmath29 for @xmath2 in the above definitions ) .",
    "since all the results in this paper are formulated for dimension 2 , we have chosen not to use this generalization here .      here",
    ", we define special classes of geometric objects that are relevant to spatio - temporal database practice .",
    "these classes are denoted by @xmath30 and they are determined by the type @xmath31 of spatial reference object and the type @xmath32 of transformation function . for clarity , a geometric object belongs to a class if all of its atomic geometric objects belong to that class .",
    "the classes of geometric figures in the plane @xmath1 that we will consider are    * @xmath33 , the class of arbitrary polygons , * @xmath34 , the class of arbitrary triangles , * @xmath35 , the class of triangles with two sides parallel to the coordinate axes , and * @xmath36the class of rectangles with all sides parallel to the coordinate axes .    in this paper , we assume triangles , polygons and rectangles to be filled objects .",
    "but since we allow two or more corner points of a triangle or rectangle to coincide , the model can deal with polylines and points too .",
    "a line segment and a point are considered triangles .",
    "also line segments parallel to the axes and points are considered rectangles .",
    "finally , note that @xmath37 .",
    "the classes of transformation functions we will consider are    * @xmath38 , the class of the affine transformations , * @xmath39 , the class of the scalings , * @xmath40 , the class of the translations , and * @xmath41 , the class consisting of the identity mapping .    it is clear that @xmath41 , @xmath40  and @xmath39  are subclasses of @xmath38 . more technically , these classes are defined as follows .",
    "the class @xmath38  of affine transformations consists of the mappings @xmath42 of the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath29 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are function from @xmath0 to @xmath0 with @xmath49 for all @xmath23 in the relevant time domain .",
    "the class @xmath39   of scalings consists of the affine transformations for which the functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 are identical to 0 .",
    "the class @xmath40  consists of the scalings for which the functions @xmath44 and @xmath29 are identical to 1 .    for practical purposes we will only consider functions @xmath44 ,",
    "@xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath29 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 that are semi - algebraic and continuous as required by the definition .",
    "these are    * the rational functions ( i.e. , fractions of polynomial functions ) , * the polynomial functions and * the linear polynomial functions .",
    "the corresponding classes of transformations will be denoted using superscripts @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "for example , @xmath53  represents the class of rational scalings .",
    "we assume that the time domain of an atomic geometric object belongs to the domain of the transformation function and that the denominator of a rational function in the definition of a transformation is never zero in the closure of the time domain ( thus , the moving figure will remain within fixed bounds during the time domain ) .",
    "note that the shape of a spatio - temporal object at a certain time instant is not necessarily the same as the shape of the reference object of the geometric object that gives rise to the spatio - temporal object .",
    "for example , a rectangle is mapped to a parallelogram under an affinity .",
    "let @xmath54 and @xmath55 be two ( atomic ) geometric objects with spatial reference objects @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively the triangles with corner points @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath61 , and time domains @xmath62 $ ] . in this time domain",
