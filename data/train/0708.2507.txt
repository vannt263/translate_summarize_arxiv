    "in the standard model ( sm ) of electro - weak and strong interactions , there are four types of gauge vector bosons ( gluon , photon , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) and twelve types of fermions ( six quarks and six leptons )  @xcite .",
    "these particles have been observed experimentally . at present , all the data obtained from the many experiments in particle physics are in agreement with the standard model . in the standard model",
    "there is one particle , the higgs boson , that is responsible for giving masses to all of the other particles  @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "the higgs particle occupies a unique position .    before the startup of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) the tevatron remains the high energy frontier .",
    "higgs searches at the tevatron are a priority for high energy physics .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) higgs may be produced at the tevatron via several mechanisms .",
    "the higgs is expected to be produced predominantly via gluon - gluon fusion  @xcite and higgs strahlung off a @xmath9 or @xmath8 boson .",
    "the third dominant process at the tevatron is vector boson fusion ( vbf ) for @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "a significant fraction of the higgs produced via these mechanisms will be associated with at least one high transverse momentum ( @xmath2 ) hadronic jet .",
    "the kinematics of higgs signals in association with jets differ significantly from that of known sm backgrounds .",
    "these properties can be exploited to select corners of the phase space where the expected signal - to - background ratios are larger than in a purely inclusive approach .    searching for a sm higgs boson at the tevatron via its decay @xmath11",
    "was first considered in  @xcite .",
    "the relevance of observing a low mass sm higgs in association with one or two jets of high @xmath2 at the lhc has been pointed out by a number of authors  @xcite .",
    "the atlas and cms experiments have confirmed these expectations with detailed detector simulations  @xcite . the feasibility of the higgs searches using the decay @xmath12 in association with one high @xmath2 jet is not discussed in the literature and is investigated here .",
    "in this paper we study the sensitivity of the tevatron experiments to a sm higgs with a mass @xmath0 using the decay @xmath12 in association with hadronic jets .",
    "we evaluate the feasibility of three event selection schemes involving events with one or two tagging jets and the impact of these selections on the sensitivity to sm higgs searches for the d0 and cdf experiments .",
    "in addition to the potential enhancement of the sensitivity , a study at the tevatron of the final states discussed here will bring significant benefit to future searches at the lhc in terms of understanding qcd effects on the production of known sm particles in these corners of the phase space .",
    "the final state under study consists of the following signatures    * two high @xmath2 leptons ( @xmath13 ) of opposite sign . * missing transverse momentum ( @xmath14 ) inconsistent with detector fluctuations . * one or two high @xmath2 hadronic jets .    for the generation of the higgs signal processes specified in section  [ sec : introduction ] , leading order ( lo ) matrix elements ( me )",
    "were interfaced with the pythia  @xcite and herwig  @xcite packages to provide parton showers and hadronization effects .",
    "the cross - section computation and the event generation were performed using the parameterization of the parton density functions provided by cteq6  @xcite .",
    "qcd next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) effects are known to be sizeable for the @xmath15 process .",
    "however , qcd nlo effects are not known for all of the backgrounds . therefore , the potential improvement in sensitivity due to these effects were not considered here .",
    ".cross - sections ( in fb ) of the sm higgs signal ( @xmath5 ) and the main background processes considered in this paper ( see text ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the cuts used in the event selections presented in sections  [ sec : selection1]-[sec : selection3 ] are the result of the optimization of the @xmath3 confidence level limit for each channel individually .",
    "the event selections have not been optimized here to achieve the best limit for the three channels combined .",
    "the expected exclusion limit was calculated using a likelihood technique  @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : results ] shows the expected @xmath3 confidence level limit as a function of the higgs mass with 5fb@xmath7 and @xmath16fb@xmath7 of integrated luminosity ( for two experiments combined ) .    in conclusion , the searches of a higgs boson using @xmath17 with the event selections presented in this paper",
    "could further enhance the sensitivity of the tevatron experiments reported in  @xcite .. ] it is important to note that we use lo cross - sections for the @xmath15 process .",
    "the nlo k - factors for this process are expected to be large , thus significantly enhancing the sensitivity of analysis i. in addition , no multivariate techniques have been implemented . with tagging hadronic jets the complexity of the final state increases and with it the relative sensitivity of a multivariate analysis with respect to the simple cut - based approach used here .",
    "in particular , variables like the transverse mass of the higgs - leading jet system , the invariant mass of the two leading jets can be used as additional discriminating variables when appropriate .",
    "the analysis strategy presented here is conservative and leaves room for significant improvement in the sensitivity .",
    "the authors are most grateful to y.  fang , l.  flores - castillo , t.  han , m.  herndon , f.  petriello and t.  vickey for most valuable comments and suggestions .",
