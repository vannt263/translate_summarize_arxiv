    "in many colloidal dispersions , the interaction between the colloidal particles ( or at least the repulsive part of these interactions ) can be represented as that of hard particles ( hard spheres , hard rods , etc . )",
    "colloidal dispersions are model systems for the experimental study of cooperative phenomena in condensed matter , since the size of these particles ( in the @xmath1 range ) and their slow dynamics allows their study in unprecedented detail , which would not be possible for condensed matter systems formed from small molecules .",
    "moreover , hard particles are the archetypical many - body systems , for which computer simulation methods were first introduced a long time ago : the importance sampling monte carlo method @xcite was introduced discussing a fluid of hard disks ; similarly , molecular dynamic methods were introduced in the context of the study of the hard sphere fluid @xcite .",
    "these fluids formed from hard particles also are an important testing ground for analytical theories of fluids @xcite .",
    "the above remarks just sketch a few motivations to explain why the simulation of fluids formed from hard particles is of fundamental importance .",
    "however , simulations of fluids containing hard particles suffer from one important technical difficulty : the well - known virial equation for the pressure tensor ( for systems where particles interact with pair - wise forces @xmath2 with @xmath3 @xcite    @xmath4    is not straightforwardly applicable ( for hard spheres of diameters @xmath5 , the force @xmath6 if @xmath7 , while distances @xmath8 are excluded , and for @xmath9 the potential energy jumps from zero to infinity , and hence the force is also not defined in this case ) .",

    "computation of the pressure is not only of the interest to clarify the equation of state of the considered system in the bulk , but is also required when one considers a system confined by walls , and wishes to estimate the excess free energy due to the walls . assuming a geometry where the system is confined by two identical walls at a ( large ) distance @xmath19 apart , the wall - fluid surface excess free energy per unit area @xmath20 ( also called `` wall tension '' ) is expressed in terms of the anisotropy of the pressure tensor as @xcite    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the `` normal pressure '' which in equilibrium is homogeneous in the system , while @xmath23 is the average tangential pressure    @xmath24    note that eq .",

    "we recognize that all these contributions exhibit rapid large oscillations near the walls .",
    "these oscillations need to be well resolved ( with a binning of the @xmath28-coordinate that is about an order of magnitude smaller than the hard sphere diameter , which sets the scale for these oscillations ) and carefully sampled .",

    "if one fits a larger range of @xmath108 , systematic errors do arise , particularly for larger values of the packing fraction .",
    "note also that the relative range of pressure variation with @xmath108 increases with increasing packing fraction .",

    "@xcite for a recent account on the literature of this problem ) .",
    "in ref . @xcite we have already presented very briefly the ensemble mixing method where one gradually transforms from a system without walls in the ( nvt ) ensemble ( with periodic boundary conditions in all three space directions ) to a system with two parallel walls at distance @xmath19 from each other ( and periodic boundary conditions only in the @xmath125 directions parallel to the walls ) . describing the system without walls by a hamiltonian @xmath126 , @xmath127 denoting a point in configuration space , and the system with walls by @xmath128 , the idea ( originally proposed by heni and lwen @xcite ) is to construct a smooth path along which one can carry out a thermodynamic integration , that yields the free energy difference between the two systems , from which hence @xmath20 can be inferred .",
    "heni and lwen @xcite applied this idea to the fluid of hard spheres , and also the recent extension due to deb et al .",
    "@xcite deals with the hard sphere fluid only . in the present section ,",

    "these moves are accepted or rejected with a metropolis step , and hence in order to ensure a large enough acceptance probability , the number of intermediate systems @xmath136 needs to be chosen proportional to the volume @xmath13 of the system .",
    "we sample the relative probability @xmath140 to reside in state @xmath56 with a variant of wang - landau sampling @xcite . alternatively",

    "the wall free energy then follows as    @xmath144    note that due to the excess density @xmath145 at the walls ( which is present in the systems with walls , so that @xmath146 ) , for any finite @xmath19 the bulk density of the system with periodic boundary conditions ( which is @xmath39 ) differs slightly but systematically from the bulk density in the system with the walls ( which is @xmath147 .",

    ", no significant finite size effects associated with the use of such small values of @xmath97 were detected .",
    "for the pressure tensor calculations , somewhat larger choices for @xmath97 have been possible ( near @xmath151 ) .",
    "again , the good agreement between both methods to obtain @xmath20 for a significant range of @xmath115 ( fig .  [ fig5]b ) can be taken as an indication that neither method suffers from significant systematic errors , in the range of the parameters of interest for the present model .",
    "in this paper , a comparative study of several methods to compute the excess free energy of walls in fluids ( the `` fluid - wall tension '' ) has been presented , considering fluids where the particles exhibit a hard - core repulsion , and hence the standard method based on the wall - induced anisotropy of the pressure tensor is not straightforward to apply .",
    "we have described three methods : ( i ) in the schmid - schilling method , the absolute free energy of the system is computed .",
    "when one does this for systems in a film geometry with several choices for the distance @xmath19 between the walls confining the film , one can infer the wall tension @xmath20 from the coefficient of the term in the free energy that exhibits a @xmath74 variation .",
    "we have tested this method so far for the hard sphere fluid only , but we did find good agreement with other methods .",
    "( ii ) the pressure tensor anisotropy method can in fact be generalized to systems , with hard potentials , by a careful sampling of the probability @xmath152 that particles do not overlap when virtual changes of the linear dimensions by a factor @xmath153 are performed .",
    "we have applied this method to the ao model of a colloid - polymer mixture , where the ( implicitly treated ) polymers are responsible for an effective attraction between the particles .",
    "the latter part of the potential is treated via the virial formula for the pressure tensor , while the repulsive part is treated with a sampling of @xmath152 , as mentioned above .",
    "we have shown that by a careful consideration of accuracy issues this method does yield valid results , but a substantial computational effort is needed .",
    "( iii ) the third method is the ensemble mixing method , where one considers systems with periodic boundary conditions and no walls `` mixed '' ( in the sense of a combined hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ eq19 ] ) ) with a system with the same particle number and linear dimensions , but bounded by walls .",
