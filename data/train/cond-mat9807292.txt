    "<S> * we present a solution to the problem of ac current partition in a multi - probe mesoscopic conductor within the nonequilibrium green s function formalism . </S>",
    "<S> this allows the derivation of dynamic conductance which is appropriate for nonequilibrium situations and which satisfies the current conservation and gauge invariance requirements . </S>",
    "<S> this formalism presents a significant generalization to previous theory : ( i ) there is no limit in the frequency , and ( ii ) it allows detailed treatments of interactions in the mesoscopic region . </S>",
    "<S> the formalism is applied to calculate dynamic conductance of tunneling structures with and without assuming wideband limit . *    </S>",
    "<S> the problem of electric current partition in a mesoscopic multi - probe conductor is a fundamental issue of quantum transport . in the familiar dc situation </S>",
    "<S> the issue is well understood from the landauer - bttiker formulation@xcite . under time </S>",
    "<S> varying ac conditions , this problem becomes more complicated due to the presence of displacement current which is induced by the ac fields according to electrodynamics@xcite . in this case , one needs to know how to partition the displacement current in addition to the particle current for each probes of the conductor . without this knowledge </S>",
    "<S> one can not obtain correct results of dynamic conductance : the electric current will not be conserved unless the displacement current is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> there is another fundamental requirement in the transport which is the gauge invariance of the theory . </S>",
    "<S> this simply means that the physics depends only on the voltage difference thus shifting voltages everywhere by the same constant amount should not not alter the results . in the ac transport </S>",
    "<S> the gauge invariance will not be satisfied without taking into account of displacement current .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum transport under dynamic conditions is the focus of a number of recent experiments@xcite . under low frequency ac fields the system is near equilibrium </S>",
    "<S> , the problem of current partition can be analyzed using scattering matrix theory ( smt ) . </S>",
    "<S> bttiker and co - workers have developed a theoretical formalism@xcite based on smt to analyze linear ac transport and derived the dynamic conductance @xmath0 . here </S>",
    "<S> a subscripts denotes a probe . by including the contribution of displacement current and its partition among the probes , </S>",
    "<S> the derived dynamic conductance guarantees current conservation and gauge invariance@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , displacement current should be even more important for higher frequencies and for situations far from equilibrium . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we address the problem of current partition _ </S>",
    "<S> far from equilibrium _ , and with this information we derive a dynamic conductance expression which conserves electric current and satisfies the gauge invariance under nonequilibrium conditions .    far from equilibrium , the keldysh nonequilibrium green s function@xcite ( negf ) has been widely applied and many problems of great interests have been analyzed . however , within this formalism contribution of displacement current has not been included . in other words </S>",
    "<S> the current conservation and gauge invariant condition have not been satisfied@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a direct consequence of neglecting displacement current is to predict incomplete results for dynamic conductance , such as that for a parallel plate capacitor . </S>",
    "<S> the fact of violating current conservation within the nonequilibrium theories has been recognized in a number of publications@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the problem is not solved because of a lack of knowledge for partition the displacement current .    </S>",
    "<S> let s consider a quantum coherent multi - probe conductor with the hamiltonian @xmath1 \\label{ham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the first term is the hamiltonian of probes where the ac signal is applied ; the second term is the general hamiltonian for the scattering region which is a polynomial in @xmath3 that commutes with the electron number operator@xcite @xmath4 ; the coupling between the probes and the scattering region is given by the last term with coupling matrix @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator inside the @xmath8-probe , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is for the scattering region .    </S>",
    "<S> the _ particle current _ </S>",
    "<S> ( conduction current ) inside probe @xmath8 can be calculated using the equation of motion for the number of carriers inside that probe . in terms of the green s function and the self - energy , </S>",
    "<S> it can be written in the familiar form@xcite in frequency representation ( @xmath11 ) , @xmath12 \\label{i1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the green s function and self - energy are defined in the usual manner@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the double - time fourier transform is defined as @xmath13\\ ] ] we will be interested in the current component linear in voltage@xcite , hence we simplify eq.([i1 ] ) by keeping the first order in voltage . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamic conductance coefficient @xmath14 due to the particle current is defined as @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 is just the frequency dependent admittance matrix due to particle current . without introducing confusion , throughout the following </S>",
    "<S> we shall use notation @xmath17 with subscripts to denote conductance , while that without subscripts ( unless otherwise stated ) to denote green s function .    in the presence of ac fields </S>",
    "<S> , the particle current alone is not conserved due to charge accumulation in the scattering region @xmath18 , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> it is the total current which is conserved@xcite , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the displacement current . in fourier space , @xmath22 where @xmath23 ~   v_{\\beta } \\label{charge}\\ ] ] is the ac charge accumulation in the scattering region and @xmath24 is the small - signal component of the green s function @xmath25 defined as @xmath26 in the linear regime@xcite , here @xmath27 is for equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> this charge is related to the displacement field @xmath28 of the internal coulomb potential via poisson equation@xcite ( more generally the potential satisfies helmhotz equation ) : @xmath29 with @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> hence the displacement current @xmath31 is just the time derivative of the pile - up charge : @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the total current in probe @xmath8 is @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> current conservation means @xmath34 .    from eq.([conserve ] ) , only the total displacement current @xmath35 is known . </S>",
    "<S> we thus need to partition it into each probe @xmath8 . to give an example , the easiest situation would be the wideband limit where the coupling constants @xmath36 are independent of energy . </S>",
    "<S> hence , for an amount of charge @xmath37 in the scattering region , the probability of leaking out through probe @xmath8 is simply @xmath38 with @xmath39 the total coupling between the probes to the scattering region . </S>",
    "<S> this gives the displacement current partition for each probe : @xmath40 .    </S>",
    "<S> more generally , we shall use two fundamental requirements of the theory to partition the displacement current : current conservation and gauge invariance . </S>",
    "<S> since current in probe @xmath8 is @xmath41 , current conservation means @xmath42 ; while gauge invariance means @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> we partition the total displacement current @xmath44 into the contributions from individual probes @xmath8 in the following form , @xmath45 , or @xmath46 where @xmath47 \\label{gd}\\ ] ] is obtained from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ charge ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the partition coefficients @xmath48 must satisfy @xmath49 to conserve the total current . to determine @xmath48 , we apply the gauge invariance condition and obtain @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> this gives the following form for the dynamic conductance @xmath51 hence by calculating the green s functions and using eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ i1 ] ) and ( [ gd ] ) , we obtain the dynamics conductance which now satisfies the current conservation and gauge invariance conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we further point out that result ( [ gab ] ) is quite general : it is suitable for ac transport coefficient in general terms of @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> it can also be applied to the strongly interacting system such as the anderson model in the large u limit by including the contribution of displacement current . </S>",
    "<S> for that model the green s functions @xmath25 and @xmath53 have been obtained by ng in ref . .    </S>",
    "<S> result ( [ gab ] ) is in agreement with the formula derived using smt , _ </S>",

    "<S> however the quantities involved in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gab ] ) are calculated within negf and we now derive these necessary quantities . in the mean field approximation </S>",

    "<S> we emphasize that while equilibrium quantities such as the fermi function do appear in this formalism , they only represent the `` initial '' condition : the system was in equilibrium at @xmath64 . for @xmath68 , </S>",
    "<S> the nonequilibrium green s function approach describes the full nonequilibrium dynamic process . with the above definitions and quantities , the dynamic conductance @xmath69 can be evaluated for a variety of systems near or far from equilibrium .    as a first example , it is useful to derive an analytic expression of admittance in the wideband limit </S>",
    "<S> . let s consider the case of resonant tunneling through a quantum dot with a single energy level @xmath70 . in the wideband limit , the steady state </S>",
    "<S> green s function @xmath71 is @xmath72 at zero temperature and through some straightforward algebra we obtain from eq.([gab ] ) , @xmath73 ~ x \\label{wide}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the ac conductance of a noninteracting ( without coulomb interaction ) symmetrical system obtained in refs . . </S>",
    "<S> the noninteracting result does not satisfy current conservation and gauge invariance , while the formula ( [ wide ] ) does : this is due to the prefactor of @xmath74 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ wide ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> one can confirm , at the linear order of ac frequency , that the wideband result ( [ wide ] ) agrees with the scattering matrix theory@xcite if we assume a breit - wigner form of the scattering matrix .    as a main result of this work </S>",
    "<S> , we now present the dynamic conductance beyond the wideband limit . </S>",
    "<S> for this case the situation is quite different and we can only obtain results numerically . from eq.([gab ] ) and the expression of @xmath75 given above , we also note that due to the energy dependence of @xmath39 , in general the dynamic conductance depends on the fermi function in more complicated fashion than simply @xmath76 . in the following </S>",
    "<S> let s calculate the admittance of a symmetric double - barrier resonant tunneling structure which consists of two @xmath77-function barriers with the same strength @xmath78 . we solve eq.([gab ] ) numerically using a method developed by mclennan _ </S>",

    "<S> both real and imaginary part of @xmath80 show three peaks due to resonance transmission through the quantum well . </S>",
    "<S> for very small @xmath52 , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ @xmath81 ( solid line ) , the real part of @xmath82 essentially coincides with the dc conductance ( not shown ) ; and the imaginary part resembles the emittance obtained from smt@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> substantial deviations is observed from these known limits when @xmath52 is larger . </S>",
    "<S> a finite @xmath52 tends to smear out the resonance behavior of the real part of @xmath80 . in fig . </S>",

    "<S> the extra peaks of fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) are due to photon assistant tunneling : the electron can absorb a photon of appropriate energy and exit from the tunnel structure at another resonance level . </S>",
    "<S> this picture is confirmed by the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) where the energy difference and the frequency difference between resonances is found to be roughly linear functions of each other , with some deviation from perfect linear behavior coming from uncertainties due to the width of the peaks . </S>",
    "<S> such a linear behavior has been observed in the experiment of ref . . finally , in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) we plot @xmath83 versus @xmath52 for double - barriers with infinite height : for this case there is no dc current which can flow through and the system becomes a parallel plate capacitor . </S>",
    "<S> due to displacement field , our formalism predicts a non - zero @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that not only the imaginary part of @xmath80 is non - zero , even the real part is non - zero . </S>",

    "<S> we have provided a solution to the problem of displacement current partition for multi - probe mesoscopic conductors within negf . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to obtain dynamic conductance in general terms of the ac frequency and the result satisfies the current conservation and gauge invariance conditions . </S>",
    "<S> while for special cases ( _ e.g. _ the wide band limit ) analytic results can be obtained , in general the dynamic conductance formula can be evaluated with well established numerical methods . while the nonequilibrium green s function formalism can be applied to situations far from equilibrium , near equilibrium it must reduce to the same results as obtained from the scattering matrix theory . for the external response , namely the conductance due to particle current , ref . </S>",
