    "the sum of flavor @xmath28 v and a spectral functions , @xmath29 , can thus be extracted from the differential decay distribution @xmath30 , for all @xmath31 .",
    "further separation into v and a components is unambiguous for @xmath32 states , but requires additional input for @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) states , making errors on the experimental distribution smallest for the v+a sum .    given the spectral functions @xmath35 , fesrs for the related correlators , @xmath36 , with @xmath37 , are straightforwardly constructable .",
    "for the scales @xmath38 considered here , the ope representations of these correlators are strongly dominated by the dimension @xmath39 contribution , which is entirely determined by @xmath0 , converges well , and is known to @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "the resulting fesrs are thus well adapted to the determination of @xmath0 . to optimize the precision of this determination , however",
    ", care must be taken in evaluating the small , residual higher @xmath41 contributions , a @xmath42 determination of @xmath43 , for example , requiring control of higher @xmath41 contributions at the level of @xmath44 of the @xmath39 term  @xcite .",

    "this process is greatly facilitated by working with polynomial weights @xmath55 defined in terms of the dimensionless variable @xmath56 . for such weights ,",

    "existing analyses are based on the approach pioneered by aleph and opal  @xcite . in this approach , ope contributions with @xmath58",
    "are assumed safely negligible for all weights employed , and the quantities @xmath59 , @xmath51 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are fitted using the @xmath62 values of the spectral integrals corresponding to the @xmath63 and @xmath64 `` @xmath65 spectral weights '' , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the kinematic weight occuring on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ taukinspectral ] ) .",
    "aleph  @xcite performed this fit independently for each of the v , a and v+a channels , while opal  @xcite performed independent fits for the v+a and combined v , a channels .",
    "a potential problem with the assumption that all @xmath58 contributions can be safely neglected is the fact that @xmath68 has degree @xmath69 which , from eq .",
    "( [ higherd ] ) , implies that contributions with @xmath41 up to @xmath70 are , in principle , present in at least one of the fesrs considered in the aleph and opal analyses .",
    "since only the single @xmath9 value @xmath62 is employed , there is no way to prevent the fit from adjusting to the presence of any neglected , but non - negligible , @xmath58 contributions by shifting the lower @xmath41 parameters determined in the fit in such a way as to compensate , as best as possible , for the missing terms .",
    "such a problem with the fit can only be exposed by studying the same , or related , fesrs over a range of @xmath9 , where the different scaling with @xmath9 of terms of different @xmath41 will become operative .",
    "a simple way to test for the presence ( or absence ) of such problems in the aleph and opal fits is to consider the @xmath9-dependent fit - qualities , @xmath71 where @xmath72 or @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the ope and spectral integrals appearing , respectively , on the rhs and lhs of the corresponding @xmath6-weighted fesr , and @xmath76 is the error on @xmath75 , determined using the experimental covariance matrix for @xmath77 .",
    "because of strong correlations between values corresponding to the same @xmath6 but different @xmath9 , a fitted version of the ope representation should be considered reliable only if @xmath78 remains @xmath79 for a range of @xmath80 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite this condition was shown to be far from satisfied for any of the spectral weights employed in the aleph and opal analyses .",
    "an illustration of the problem is provided in figure  [ fig1 ] , which shows the @xmath81 corresponding to the 2005 aleph final data and ope fit for four weights , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 , all having degree @xmath86 ( and hence ope contributions only up to @xmath87 ) .",
    "if the fitted values for the @xmath88 ope parameters obtained by aleph are reliable , one should find an @xmath9 window below @xmath89 having @xmath90 for all four weights .",
    "the results , given by the light lines in the figure , show that no such window exists .",
    "in fact , for the weights @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 not employed in the original fit , the fit quality is poor even at @xmath62 .    the problem seen in the figure could be due either to contamination of the @xmath88 ope fit parameters by neglected , but non - negligible , @xmath58 contributions , or to ope breakdown .",
    "one may test the latter possibility by performing alternate fits in which potential @xmath58 contributions , where present , are explicitly taken into account .",
    "the results of such fits , discussed in the next section , yield alternate ope representations in excellent agreement with the corresponding spectral integrals over a range of @xmath9 , both for the weights employed in the fits and for related weights with ope representations determined by the same set of ope parameters .",
    "the resulting alternate fit qualities , @xmath81 , for the four degree @xmath86 weights already discussed above , are shown by the dark lines in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the results clearly show no evidence for ope breakdown .",
    "in what follows , we employ the updated charmonium sum rule determination of @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "the gluon condensate term dominates the @xmath48 ope contribution .",
    "details on the input for the small corrections proportional to @xmath49 and @xmath50 may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the @xmath39 contributions are evaluated using the expression for the @xmath39 adler function series from ref .",
    "an @xmath94 contribution , employing the estimated value for the corresponding coefficient from ref .",
    "@xcite , is included for our central fit .",
    "we consider both the contour improved ( cipt ) and fixed order ( fopt ) determinations of the integrated @xmath39 sum .",
    "the reference scale @xmath4 coupling needed in the evaluation of the cipt and fopt sums ( taken to be @xmath59 ) is a parameter to be determined in the fit .    since , for v and a correlators , ope breakdown is expected ( and observed ) to set in for @xmath9 below @xmath95  @xcite , a limited window of @xmath9 values is available for use in fitting @xmath0 and the unknown @xmath96 .",
    "it is thus convenient to work with fesrs based on the weights @xmath97 which , like @xmath82 , have a double zero at @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) . from eq .",
    "( [ higherd ] ) we see that the @xmath100 fesr involves only a single integrated unknown @xmath101 ope contribution , @xmath102 . as @xmath103",
    "is increased , the scaling of this contribution with @xmath9 becomes more and more rapid , aiding in the fitting of @xmath104 .",
    "the decrease in the coefficient factor , @xmath105 , also means that the corresponding fesr is more strongly @xmath39 dominated , a desirable situation for the determination of @xmath0 .",
    "the latter effect is dominant for sufficiently large @xmath103 .",
    "in addition , as @xmath103 is increased , @xmath106 , whose single zero at @xmath98 provides less strong suppression of contributions from the region of the timelike point on the ope contour .",
    "we thus restrict our attention to the @xmath107 fesrs .",
    "since @xmath45 contributions are negligible and @xmath48 contributions are fixed by phenomenological input , the only ope parameters to be fit using the @xmath100 fesr are @xmath59 and @xmath104 .",
    "the @xmath104 will of course depend on the channel ( v , a or v+a ) being considered .",
    "the values for @xmath59 obtained using the different @xmath100 and/or different channels should , however , be consistent , and this consistency represents an important cross - check on the reliability of the analysis framework .",
    "we have analyzed the @xmath107 fesrs using the final 2005 aleph isovector data and covariances , in each of the v , a and v+a channels .",
    "a similar analysis has been performed for the v+a channel using the opal data and covariances .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for further details , and a discussion of the reasons for the analysis choices .",
    "we report here only on the results for @xmath59 . a full discussion of the errors , and results for the @xmath104 ,",
    "may be found in ref .",
    "results obtained using the cipt prescription are presented in table  [ table1 ] . for each entry ,",
    "the first error is experimental ( computed using the experimental covariance matrix , and including the @xmath108 normalization uncertainty ) , while the second is theoretical .",
    "the corresponding fopt - based results may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    ".[table1]results of the @xmath100 cipt - based fesr fits for @xmath59 obtained using either the aleph or opal data and covariances .",
    "the first error is experimental and the second theoretical . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from the table we see excellent consistency between the aleph - based v , a and v+a results , as well as between the aleph and opal v+a results .",
    "there is also extremely good consistency within each channel between results obtained using the different @xmath100 .",
    "this consistency is realized only after fitting the small , but non - negligible , @xmath101 contributions on the ope sides of the various fesrs  @xcite .",
    "the fopt results corresponding to different @xmath100 but the same channel display significantly less good consistency  @xcite . from the table",
    ", one sees that theoretical errors are a factor of @xmath109 larger than the corresponding experimental errors . the dominant contribution to the theoretical error",
    "is that associated with the truncation of the series for the dominant @xmath39 ope contribution .",
    "our truncation error is the sum in quadrature of the shift in @xmath0 produced by including the last incorporated term in the truncated adler function series and the difference between the results produced by the fopt and cipt evaluations .",
    "the latter contribution is the larger of the two and , as noted previously in the literature , shows no signs of decreasing with increasing truncation order .",
    "the fopt - cipt difference thus dominates the current uncertainty .",
    "our central determination for @xmath0 is based on the v+a analyses , which has the smallest experimental errors .",
    "averaging the aleph- and opal - based results using the non - normalization component of the experimental errors yields @xmath110 where the errors are experimental ( including normalization ) and theoretical , respectively .    the @xmath2 result , @xmath43 , is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ finalalphastau ] ) using the standard self - consistent combination of @xmath111-loop running with @xmath112-loop matching at the flavor thresholds  @xcite . with @xmath113 gev , @xmath114 gev  @xcite ,",
    "matching thresholds @xmath115 with @xmath116 varying between @xmath117 and @xmath112 , and standard estimates for the effect of the truncated running and matching , the evolution - induced uncertainty on @xmath43 is @xmath118 .",
    "our final result is then @xmath119 the difference between this value and that obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath120 , serves to quantify the impact of the @xmath58 contributions neglected in the earlier spectral weight analyses .",
    "the result , eq .  ( [ finalalphasmz ] ) , is in excellent agreement with recent independent determinations , including that of the updated global ew analysis  @xcite and two recent updates  @xcite of the older hpqcd / ukqcd lattice determination  @xcite .    with theory errors dominant , and the @xmath39 truncation uncertainty dominating the theory error , further improvement will be possible only if a better understanding of the truncation uncertainty can be obtained . in a recent paper , beneke and jamin",
    "@xcite investigated this issue using a model which incorporates the general structure associated with the first two ir renormalon and leading uv renormalon singularities of the resummed @xmath39 series .",
    "this particular version of what could be a more general model was used to argue in favor of the fopt over the cipt prescription .",
    "the fopt evaluation , as well as the resummed model , together with assumed values for @xmath60 and @xmath61 , were also used to determine @xmath0 . while it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the assumed @xmath60 and @xmath61 values are not consistent with the @xmath0 obtained using fopt , the underlying approach remains extremely interesting .",
    "in fact , one can see that the minimal version of the model employed in ref .",
    "@xcite predicts cipt approximations which deviate from the model version of the related resummed series by amounts that are sizeable , and a factor of @xmath109 larger for @xmath121 than for @xmath91 and @xmath92  @xcite .",
    "the deviations are significantly smaller for the fopt versions . were the model to provide a good representation of the true resummed series , one would thus expect no set of @xmath0 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 to provide a good quality simultaneous cipt fit for the @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath121 spectral integrals , while a reasonable quality simultaneous fit would be expected to exist using the fopt prescription .",
    "in fact , just the opposite occurs : the values of @xmath0 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 obtained from a combined cipt fit to the @xmath91 , @xmath92 fesrs provide also an excellent representation of the @xmath121 spectral integrals , while those obtained from the corresponding fopt fit provide a very poor one .",
    "this suggests an extended version of the beneke - jamin model , perhaps taking into account more ir and/or uv renormalon singularities , is likely to be needed . the fact that it is possible to reach such a conclusion",
    ", however , immediately makes clear that the sets of variously weighted @xmath9-dependent spectral integrals provide significant constraints for use in constructing such generalizations .",
    "it is thus likely that such modelling can be improved in future , and used to reduce the truncation uncertainty component in the determination of @xmath0",
