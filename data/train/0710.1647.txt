    "although many @xmath6 meson studies have been performed by lep and tevatron experiments , only a few @xmath6 decay branching fractions have been measured @xcite .",
    "recently an alternative source of @xmath6 mesons has been explored : @xmath6 production by @xmath2 colliders running at the @xmath1(5s ) energy .",
    "several important measurements have been performed recently .    in 2003 ,",
    "the cleo collaboration collected a data sample of 0.42  fb@xmath0 at the @xmath1(5s ) .",
    "based on this data , in 2005 cleo published an analysis of inclusive @xmath7 production at the @xmath1(5s ) @xcite . in this paper , the @xmath8 production cross - section at the @xmath1(5s )",
    "was measured , a procedure to extract the fraction @xmath9 of @xmath10 events over all @xmath8 events was developed , and the value @xmath11 was obtained . in 2006 , cleo published an analysis of exclusive @xmath6 decays @xcite , where a method , similar to that used at the @xmath1(4s ) , was used to extract @xmath6 signals .",
    "cleo found 14 candidates consistent with a @xmath6 decaying into final states with a @xmath12 or a @xmath7 .",
    "these measurements provided a first evidence of @xmath6 production at the @xmath1(5s ) .    in 2005 , the belle collaboration collected a data sample of 1.86  fb@xmath0 at the @xmath1(5s ) ; this sample is 4.4 times larger than the cleo dataset . using these data , first @xmath6 signals with significance larger than 5@xmath13 were obtained . in 2007 ,",
    "@xmath7 , @xmath14 and @xmath12 inclusive production at the @xmath1(5s ) decays was measured @xcite and the fraction @xmath11 was determinined , in good agreement with the cleo value . later",
    ", exclusive @xmath15 decays to a @xmath12 and a @xmath7 were also measured by belle @xcite , and the combined @xmath6 signal yield obtained was @xmath16 events . with these data ,",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath17 meson masses were also measured .",
    "our combined @xmath6 signal yield disagrees significantly with the cleo measurement ( by about factor three ) .",
    "moreover , our signal yield is 25@xmath18 larger than predicted by mc simulation , assuming equality of @xmath19 and @xmath6 ( with @xmath20 quark replacement ) decay branching fractions",
    ". additionally , we also studied the rare decays @xmath5 , @xmath4 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "although no significant signals were observed with the 1.86  fb@xmath0 dataset , background levels in these decays were accurately estimated and found to be low , indicating good potential for future rare @xmath6 decay studies at high luminosity @xmath2 colliders .",
    "theoretically almost zero @xmath23 violation is expected in @xmath6 mixing within the standard model , therefore the search for the @xmath23 violation provides an important opportunity to observe beyond standard model effects .",
    "it is interesting to note that the conventional method of time dependent @xmath23 violation measurement is often assumed to be impossible at the @xmath1(5s ) due to very fast @xmath6 oscillations .",
    "however this is potentially possible , since the corresponding distance between oscillation function maximum and minimum at the @xmath1(5s ) is .",
    "such decay vertex resolution can be reached by existing vertex detectors ; however a beam pipe with a small size or a flat profile should be used .",
    "another method was proposed in 2004 by the superkekb physics working group @xcite : @xmath23 violation effects in @xmath6 decays at the @xmath1(5s ) can be observed using decay time information and the @xmath23-even and @xmath23-odd @xmath6 decay width difference .",
    "this method modifies the general idea proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for high energy hadron colliders .    in 2006",
    "the belle collaboration collected at the @xmath1(5s ) a data sample of 21.7  fb@xmath0 .",
    "this sample provides the possibility to make the next step in @xmath6 studies at the @xmath1(5s ) : to move from `` first evidence '' to `` measurements '' . here , the first results obtained with the full belle dataset of 23.6  fb@xmath0 are reported .",
    "measurements of total semileptonic @xmath19 , @xmath24 and @xmath6 branching fractions , together with corresponding well - measured lifetimes , provide determination of semileptonic widths .",
    "these widths for the @xmath19 , @xmath24 and @xmath6 mesons are expected to be equal , neglecting small corrections due to electromagnetic and light quark mass difference effects .",
    "the correlated production of a @xmath25 meson and a same - sign lepton at the @xmath1(5s ) resonance is used in this analysis to measure @xmath26 .",
    "the method exploits the fact that , at the @xmath1(5s ) , the dominant production of a same - sign @xmath25 meson and a fast lepton comes from the @xmath10 state . neither the @xmath27 continuum nor @xmath28 states ( except a small contribution due to @xmath29 @xmath19 mixing effect ) can result in a same - sign @xmath30-quark ( i.e. , @xmath7 meson ) and primary lepton final state .",
    "simultaneous production of a same - sign @xmath25 meson and a lepton from one @xmath6 decay is totally negligible .    to obtain the number of @xmath25 mesons produced from @xmath6 decays",
    ", we compare the normalized @xmath25 momentum distribution in the @xmath1(5s ) , @xmath1(4s ) and continuum data samples .",
    "the continuum contributions were subtracted from the @xmath1(5s ) and @xmath1(4s ) data samples and the resulting distributions are used to calculate the number of @xmath25 mesons produced from @xmath6 decays .",
    "the number of the same - sign @xmath25 and lepton events is obtained at the @xmath1(5s ) , @xmath1(4s ) and continuum data samples as a function of lepton momentum for the whole @xmath25 momentum range @xmath31gev / c .",
    "backgrounds due to @xmath1(5s)@xmath32 and continuum processes , lepton misidentification , photon conversion , and charged kaon decays are subtracted from the @xmath1(5s ) data to obtain the same - sign @xmath25 and lepton events from @xmath6 decays .",

    ". 1 ) are used to extract the numbers of primary and secondary leptons .",
    "we fit the data with a function that includes the sum of two terms with fixed shapes and free normalizations : one from primary leptons ( harder spectrum ) and one from secondary leptons .",
    "we fit separately the electron spectrum and the muon spectrum , as shown in .",
    "we also fit the two distributions simultaneously , assuming an equal electron and muon production rate in @xmath6 decays , for both primary and secondary leptons .",
    "finally , dividing the numbers of same - sign @xmath25 and lepton events by the full number of @xmath25 mesons from @xmath6 decays in our @xmath1(5s ) data sample and applying an additional factor 1/2 due to the @xmath6 mixing effect , we obtain the following semileptonic branching fractions :    @xmath33    @xmath34    @xmath35    where the last value represents an average over electrons and muons .",
    "the obtained branching fractions are consistent with the pdg value @xmath36 @xcite , which is theoretically expected to be approximately the same , neglecting a small possible lifetime difference and small corrections due to electromagnetic and light quark mass difference effects .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath5 are also studied with the 23.6  fb@xmath0 data sample at the @xmath1(5s ) .",
    "the @xmath37 decay is used to calibrate the central positions of @xmath38 and @xmath39 peaks .",
    "the analysis of @xmath37 decays is not yet finished , the distributions shown are used only for calibration purposes .",
    "signals are described by gaussian functions , whereas backgrounds are described by a linear function in @xmath39 and a so - called argus function in @xmath40 .",
