    "possibly because of the great difficulty of growing well characterized samples , experimental studies of ferroelectric superlattices have been published only in recent years(iijima _  et al_. 1992 ; tsurumi et al .",
    "1994 ; wiener - avnear 1994 ; tabata , tanaka and kawai 1994 ; kanno _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ; zhao t. _ et al_. 1999 ) .",
    "some exploratory theoretical work on ferroelectric superlattices has appeared ( tilley 1988 ; schwenk , fishman and schwabl 1988 ; schwenk , fishman and schwabl 1990 ) .",
    "their starting point is the ginzburg - laudau phenomenological theory .    on the microscopic level , the transverse ising model ( tim)(de gennes 1963 ; binder 1987 ; tilley and zeks 1984 ;",
    "cottam , tilley and zeks 1984)was used to study infinite ferroelectric superlattices under mean field theory ( qu , zhong and zhang 1994 ; qu , zhong and zhang 1995 ; zhong and smith 1998 ) or effective field theory(zhou and yang ) . from the experimental point of view",
    "the tim is a valuable model because of its possible applications , for example in studies of hydrogen bonded ferroelectrics(de gennes 1963 ) , cooperative jahn - teller systems(elliot _ et al_. 1971 ) and strongly anisotropic magnetic materials in a transverse field(wang and cooper 1968 ) .",
    "the reviews of blinc and zeks(1972 ) and stinchcombe(1973 ) give more details about possible applications of the tim .",
    "in the present paper , we consider a finite ferroelectric superlattice in which the elementary unit cell is made up of @xmath0 atomic layers of type @xmath1 and @xmath2 atomic layers of type @xmath3 the mean - field approximation is employed and the equation for the curie temperature is obtained by use of the transfer matrix method .",
    "we study two models of the superlattice which alternate as abab ... ab(model i ) or ababa ...",
    "ba ( model ii ) .",
    "numerical results are given for the dependence of the curie temperature on the thickness and exchange constants of the superlattice .",
    "we start with the tim(de gennes 1963 ; sy 1993 , qu , zhong and zhang 1994 ; qu , zhong and zhang 1995 ; zhong and smith 1998 ; bouziane et al .",
    "1999 ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the @xmath7 and @xmath8 components of the pseudo - spin , @xmath9 are plane indices and @xmath10 are different sites of the planes , @xmath11 denote the exchange constants .",
    "we assume that the transverse field @xmath12 is dependent only on layer index and consider the interaction between neighboring sites . for simplicity , we take @xmath13 the same in the superlattice because the main qualitative important features result from the difference of @xmath14    the spin average @xmath15 , obtained from the mean field theory @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the mean field acting on the ith spin , @xmath18 is the boltzman constant and @xmath19 is the temperature .    at a temperature close and below the curie temperature , @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    "are small , @xmath22 , equation ( 2 ) can be approximated as @xmath23\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath24 and @xmath8 are the numbers of nearest neighbors in a certain plane and between successive planes respectively .",
    "let us rewrite eq.(4 ) in matrix form in analogy with the reference(barnas 1992 )    @xmath25    with @xmath26 as the transfer matrix defined by @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29.$ ]    we consider a ferroelectric superlattice which alternates as @xmath30 .",
    "in each elementary unit @xmath31 there are @xmath0 atomic layers of type @xmath1 and @xmath2 atomic layers of type @xmath3 the intralayer exchange constants are given by @xmath32 and @xmath33 whereas the exchange constants between different layers is described by @xmath34 we assume there are @xmath35 elementary units and the layer index is from @xmath36 to @xmath37 in this case , the transfer matrix @xmath38reduces to two types :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 @xmath41and @xmath42.$ ]    from eq.(5 ) , we get    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the total transfer matrix .    from the above equation and the following equations    @xmath45",
    "we obtain the equation for the curie temperature of the superlattice as    @xmath46    next we consider model ii , the superlattice which alternates as @xmath47 and assume that the lattice has @xmath48 layers .",
    "the total transfer matrix @xmath49 and the equation for the curie temperature is obtained as @xmath50    for an unimodular matrix @xmath51 , the n - th power of @xmath51 can be linearized as(yariv 1992 ; wang , pan and yang 1999 )    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the unit matrix , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the two eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath56    using eq.(14 ) , we obtain    @xmath57    where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 then from eqs.(15 ) and ( 16 ) , the matrix @xmath62 in eq.(9 ) can be written explicitly as    @xmath63    the trace of the matrix @xmath64 is    @xmath65    since @xmath66 the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath64 is @xmath67 then using eq.(14 ) , we get    @xmath68    where @xmath69    using eq.(15)-(19 ) , we can express the total transfer matrix @xmath70 and @xmath71 in terms of @xmath72 and @xmath73 we can get an explicit expression for equations ( 11 ) and ( 13 ) for the curie temperature by substituting the matrix elements of @xmath70 and @xmath71 into eq.(11 ) and ( 13 ) , respectively .",
    "the results are tedious , we only give numerical results below .",
    "fig.1 gives the dependence of the reduced curie temperature @xmath74 against the reduced exchange constant @xmath75 in model i and ii .",
    "the curie temperature increases with increase of @xmath76 it is clear that the curie temperatures in model ii are larger than those in model i. the reason is that the superlattice in model ii is thicker than that in model i. the fact that the curie temperature increases with the increase of @xmath75 can also be seen in fig.2 .",
    "fig.2 shows the dependence of the reduced curie temperature @xmath74 against the reduced exchange constant @xmath75 for different @xmath77 in model i. the transverse field causes a reduction of the curie temperature .",
    "in other words , the curie temperature decreases with increase of @xmath78    fig.3 shows the dependence of the curie temperature on the number of elementary units @xmath35 in model i@xmath4 @xmath79 in the figure is the curie temperature of the corresponding infinite superlattice .",
    "the curie temperature of the infinite superlattice can be determined from the following equation(wang , pan and yang 1999 )    @xmath80    the curie temperature of a finite superlattice is always less than that of a corresponding infinite superlattice , and it increases with the increase of the number of elementary units @xmath35 to approach asymptotically to @xmath79 for large values of @xmath81",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the phase transition properties of a finite ferroelectric superlattice in which the elementary unit cell is made up of @xmath82 atomic layers of type @xmath1 and @xmath2 atomic layers of type @xmath3 by the transfer matrix method we derived the equation for the curie temperature of the superlattice@xmath4 numerical results are given for the dependence of the curie temperature on the thickness and exchange constants of the superlattice .",
    "the method proposed here can be applied to the finite superlattice in which each elementary unit cell is made up of many types of materials and the atomic layers of each type can be arbitrary .",
    "the finite superlattice is more realistic than the infinite superlattice in experiments .",
    "we hope that the present work will have relevance to some future experiments .",
