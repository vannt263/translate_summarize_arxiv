    "ab aur ( also known as hd 31293 and sao 57506 , @xmath1 pc ) is a young , ( @xmath2 myr ) intermediate - mass ( @xmath3 m@xmath4 ) , herbig ae star @xcite that is actively accreting material .",
    "it is surrounded by a large envelope which extends out to at least 1320 au and blends into a nearby nebula @xcite . within the envelope",
    ", a protoplanetary disk ( r @xmath5 au ; mannings & sargent 1997 ) surrounds the central star and displays many complex structures @xcite .    at 1.6 and 2 @xmath6 m the disk has a region of decreased polarized intensity , which is likely due to the scattering geometry of the surface of ab aur s inclined disk @xcite .",
    "however , more recent hiciao _",
    "h_-band imagery has shown an additional six regions of decreased polarized intensity ( pi ) that are not explained by geometric scattering effects @xcite .",
    "these data also revealed an approximately 16 au wide gap in the disk .",
    "centered at 80 au from the central star , it is similar to the mid - ir gap inferred by @xcite from models of their 24.6 @xmath6 m imagery , but appears to be different from the gap detected by @xcite , who find a gap which ends at approximately 110 au and is about 90 au wide in 1.3 mm continuum emission .",
    "spiral structures in the disk were first detected in stis imagery by @xcite and later imaged in the _ h _ band by @xcite , who suggested that they are either maintained by a planet , due to gravitational instabilities within the disk , or the result of the outer envelope replenishing disk material .",
    "subsequent work by @xcite and @xcite show evidence of the spiral structures in _",
    "h_-band pi imagery , @xmath7co ( 3 - 2 ) maps , and at 850 @xmath6 m .",
    "both works favor planetary bodies perturbing the disk as an explanation for the formation of the spirals .",
    "however , a planet has yet to be detected in the system .",
    "@xcite recently detected four spirals in the co gas , which are generally not coincident with the spirals detected in the near - ir .",
    "for example , @xcite s co s2 spiral appears to share a base with the _",
    "s1 spiral as labeled by @xcite , but the outer regions of the two spiral arms do not overlap .",
    "similarly , the _ h_-band s3 spiral appears to potentially be a continuation of the co s3 spiral at regions farther from the central star , but there is a gap between the regions where the spirals have been detected ; the innermost region detected of the _",
    "s3 spiral and the outermost detected region for the co s3 spiral do not spatially overlap . finally , the other two co spirals , co s1 and co s4 , appear to have no near - ir counterpart at all .",
    "@xcite recently suggested a different formation mechanism for the spirals whereby a combination of the rotation and infall of material from the envelope allows for the build up of higher density regions along the envelope s bipolar cavities . due to the system",
    "s low inclination angle ( @xmath8 ; tang et al .",
    "2012 ) , these regions of higher density are projected onto the disk and form the observed spiral structures . they appear as part of the disk , but are actually high density regions of the envelope .",
    "however , observational constraints on the density , infall rate , and rotational speed of the envelope do not exist , making it difficult to determine the likelihood of this scenario .",
    "very little is known about ab aur s envelope , partly because of the difficulty of disentangling the observed contributions of the disk and envelope ( e.g. co lines trace the mid - plane disk structure , but @xcite also suggests it traces the envelope morphology ) .",
    "@xcite found no evidence for any infall of material in their study of the co lines .",
    "this agrees with the overall conclusions of @xcite , who use two dimensional radiative transfer modeling of the system s sed to place constraints on the mass accretion rate from the envelope .",
    "they find that the infall rate might be as high as @xmath9 m@xmath4 yr@xmath10 , but their best fit model uses no infall at all , suggesting that the envelope is very optically thin .",
    "in this paper , we analyze multi - epoch _ h_-band imagery of ab aur to investigate whether the positions of its spiral arms at these wavelengths have changed with time .",
    "a variety of observations of ab aur have been modeled in the past ( including but not limited to , its sed by @xcite and @xcite , sed and nir interferometry by @xcite , nir scattered light imagery by @xcite and @xcite , sed and mid - ir imagery by @xcite , and mm emission by @xcite ) .",
    "however , self - consistent models of the sed and near - ir imagery of the system , which can be useful in interpreting multi - epoch imagery , have not been extensively explored .",
    "therefore , we first used a three - dimensional , monte carlo , radiative transfer code to model the overall behavior of the system s sed and _ h_-band imagery . after finding that some of the spiral structures in the system could arise in the disk ,",
    "as noted in previous works , we compare two sets of archival _",
    "h_-band imagery in order to determine if the position of the spirals have changed with time .",
    "we used the sed compiled by @xcite in their tables 8 , 9 , 10 , and 11 to compare to our modeled sed .",
    "this includes _",
    "ubvri _ and _ lmnq _ data from kenyon & hartmann ( 1995 ) ; _ jhk _ data from the 2mass all - sky survey ; far - ir _ iras _",
    "12 @xmath6 m , 25 @xmath6 m , 60 @xmath6 m , and 100 @xmath6 m data from weaver & jones ( 1992 ) ; and sharc 350 @xmath6 m , scuba 450 @xmath6 m , and scuba 850 @xmath6 m submillimeter data from andrews & williams ( 2005 ) .",
    "we supplemented the @xcite sed with additional photometry from the allwise catalog at 3.35 , 11.6 , and 22.1 @xmath6 m @xcite ; the akari irc all - sky survey point source catalogue data at 8.61 and 18.4 @xmath6 m ; hershall data at 70 and 160 @xmath6 m @xcite ; scuba-2 1300 @xmath6 m data @xcite ; and sma data at 1300 @xmath6 m @xcite .",
    "we also made use of spectra from the short wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) aboard the _ infrared space observatory _",
    "( iso ) @xcite .",
    "we also use two archival _ h_-band images of ab aur obtained by the ciao @xcite and hiciao @xcite instruments on the subaru 8.2 m telescope .",
    "the ciao data ( originally published in fukagawa et al .",
    "2004 ) consist of several image data sets taken on 2004 january 8 and 11 which were combined into the one final _",
    "h_-band image with a pixel scale of @xmath11 mas pixel@xmath10 .",
    "additional details about how those observations were obtained , reduced , and calibrated can be found in @xcite , including information about exposure times , number of frames , and psf subtraction .    the hiciao data ( originally published in hashimoto et al .",
    "2011 ) were obtained on 2009 october 31 as part of the strategic explorations of exoplanets and disks with subaru ( seeds ) program @xcite .",
    "seven sets of data were combined to form the final _",
    "h_-band pi image ( @xmath12 mas pixel@xmath10 ) .",
    "additional details about observing in polarimetric mode and reduction procedures can be found in @xcite .",
    "ab aur has a rich history both of multi - wavelength observations and detailed modeling efforts to explore the nature of the gas and dust surrounding the system , as noted in the introduction . as our goal is to analyze and interpret multi - epoch _",
    "h_-band imagery of the system , we first modeled the global behavior of the system s sed and _ h_-band imagery to assess the potiential origin of observed morphological structures .",
    "we used ` hochunk3d ` , a publicly available monte carlo radiative transfer code ( mcrt ) that allows a user to place circumstellar material around a forming star and define its three - dimensional geometry ( a description of the original code can be found in whitney et al .",
    "2003 ; see whitney et al .",
    "2013 and references therein for updates to the code ) to simultaneously model seds and imagery .",
    "currently , the code offers a suite of different geometries , including warps , gaps , and spirals within the accretion disk structure ; an infalling envelope ; and a bipolar outflow cavity . in the most recent update to the code",
    ", @xcite decouples the large and small grain populations so that disk settling can be included .",
    "the analytic formula for calculating these geometries are given in @xcite ; however , we briefly describe them and some additional details here .",
    "the distribution of dust in disks surrounding a central star is controlled by the @xmath13 and @xmath14 parameters in the following density profile equations : @xmath15 ^ 2\\right\\}\\ ] ] @xmath16 where h is the scale height of the disk , r is the radius , and z is the distance above and below the midplane of the disk .",
    "accretion from the disk onto the central star is included by taking into account the accretion luminosity of the system and is set by an accretion rate parameter .",
    "the functional form of the envelope in our model is given by @xcite and is a rotating sphere undergoing free fall gravitational collapse .",
    "temperatures for the various components are corrected based on the lucy method @xcite .",
    "the code uses a henyey - greenstein phase function for scattering photons in this material , and calculates output seds and imagery for a given viewing angle using the ` peeling - off ' optical raytracing algorithm @xcite .",
    "we modeled the ab aur system as a pre - transitional disk with the ` hochunk3d ` code .",
    "our basic disk geometry includes a settled , large grain disk surrounded by smaller grains , and a gap at 100 au ( consistent with the location hashimoto et al .",
    "2011 derived from _",
    "h_-band pi observations ) .",
    "we use a 10,000 k kurucz model atmosphere file with @xmath17 and @xmath18 as our input stellar spectrum and determined basic disk parameters through a trial and error process .",
    "while the ` hochunk3d ` code has the ability to add spirals into a disk structure , it is done in an ad hoc fashion and requires us to make an a priori decision about their location , i.e. determining that the spirals are disk or envelope structures .",
    "therefore , we do not include any non - axisymmetric structures within our model , and rather focus on reproducing the global sed and overall surface brightness morphology of the system .",
    "we computed @xmath19500 unique models that explored a range of disk and envelope parameter space .",
    "we began this process using 1,000,000 photon model runs to compare the observed sed to those produced by our model .",
    "we formally calculated a @xmath20 value for each model in our parameter space and compared the @xmath20 trends of different parameters ( e.g. different envelope sizes ) against each other .",
    "however , we caution that formal goodness of fit metrics such as @xmath20 are generally not useful for determining which ` hochunk3d ` models better fit observed data because it is well known that mcrt modeling involves significant parameter degeneracies ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is highly likely that a ` better ' model , as indicated by the @xmath20 statistic , can be found using unphysical parameters .",
    "hence , we did not blindly follow the @xmath20 statistic to determine which model best reproduces the data .",
    "instead , we use this formal statistic only to compare trends in our models which already have parameters appropriate for the ab aur system .",
    "once we arrived at parameter families that broadly reproduced the observed sed , we followed those with @xmath19270 runs with 100,000,000 photons to compute detailed model imagery of the system in the h - band .",
    "because the broad parameter space using a grid of slightly simpler , albeit generally analogous , models @xcite was analyzed for ab aur and constrained by its observed sed @xcite , and because the goal of our modeling was simply to establish a plausible ` best - fit ' to the system s sed and h - band imagery , we do not describe the detailed properties of the acceptable model parameter families we found .",
    "rather , we simply present and discuss the basic properties of this ` best - fit ' model ( table 1 ) , with the caveat that it is not unique owing to well - known parameter degeneracies , and use this as a basis to interpret the available multi - epoch imagery of the system .",

    "this model broadly reproduces ab aur s sed , although we note it slightly over - predicts the level of near - ir flux compared to what is observed .",
    "our model imagery ( figure [ sed ] ) reproduces the visibility of the gap within the disk .",
    "moreover , our model reproduces the general behavior of the observed surface brightness along the major and minor axes outside of the gap region in the archival _",
    "h_-band pi imagery taken with hiciao ( figure [ sed ] ) .",
    "because previous maps of the polarization fraction of the disk are relatively uniform ( i.e. @xcite ) due to the system s low inclination , we also compare the surface brightness profiles of the _ h_-band total light ciao imagery along the major and minor axes with our _ h_-band pi model imagery in figure 1 . with this comparison",
    "we find results similar to the comparison between our model and the hiciao data ; our model reproduces the general behavior of the disk s observed surface brightness profile .",
    "however , our the model is slightly less successful at reproducing the observed surface brightness at the edge - of and interior to the gap region in the hiciao data . because this flux discrepancy at and inside the disk edge can be reduced by increasing the scale height and density of the material in the gap region at the expense of degrading the nir sed fit , we speculate that a broader exploration of geometries at this disk boundary , which are outside the scope of this paper , could improve these fits .",
    "we note that in order to compare our model with the observed data , we must normalize all of the surface brightness profiles relative to each other . this type of scaling is not uncommon when using hochunk3d outputs because the model imagery is in units of counts as opposed to an absolute flux .",
    "we also scaled the ciao and hiciao imagery relative to each other for display purposes .        despite simultaneously modeling both the sed and _",
    "pi imagery of the system in three dimensions , our model is not significantly different than those previously presented in the literature ( e.g. bouwman et al . 2000 and robitaille et al . 2007 ) , which aimed to reproduce only the sed of the system .",
    "a breakdown of our model s best fit sed into its individual system components shows that from the near to far ir it is disk dominated ( figure [ sed ] ) .",
    "our model has minimal contributions from envelope material , which is consistent with @xcite s ab aur model .",
    "therefore , our model , along with previous models presented in the literature , demonstrates that a disk dominated model can plausibly reproduce many of ab aur s observed features , particularly at near - ir wavelengths .",
    "in section 3 we showed that the envelope has little effect on the observed _ h_-band imagery and sed of the ab aur system using monte carlo modeling techniques .",
    "in fact , figure [ sed ] shows that the envelope minimally contributes to the system s sed at mid- and far ir wavelengths , while the only significant contributor at _ h _ band is the disk . in our models ,",
    "the envelope density is low enough to not significantly affect the observed sed or morphology of the disk at _ h _ band .",
    "therefore , the only scenarios that are consistent with our modeling results are those that include an envelope with little to no material .",
    "this interpretation is also consistent with our low mass infall rate from the envelope ( @xmath29 m@xmath4 yr@xmath30 ) , which is proportional to the envelope density and mass ; we require a low mass infall rate , and therefore low envelope mass , to fit the observed data .",
    "these results are also in agreement with previous modeling attempts that can be found in the literature ( e.g. robitaille et al .",
    "2007 ) , which also find that a disk dominated model best reproduces many of ab aur s observed features .    if such a low density envelope is the correct interpretation of the observed data , we believe that the disk , which has a much higher density and total mass than the envelope , is more likely to produce and maintain spiral structures , especially at ab aur s current evolutionary stage .",
    "this supports the idea that at least some of the spirals are part of the disk .",
    "assuming that the spirals originate from perturbations within the disk , there exists several possible formation scenarios , such as disk - planet interactions , other gravitational instabilities , magneto - rotational instabilities , and accretion of material onto the outer regions of the disk .",
    "we consider the implications of the disk - planet origin by analyzing the behavior of multi - epoch _ h_-band scattered light imagery below .",
    "we obtained the previously reduced and published _",
    "ciao @xcite and hiciao @xcite imagery of the system to measure any potential rotation of the spiral features .",
    "use of multi - epoch data in this way can constrain potential locations of planets within the system . by comparing the location of the spirals between the ciao and hiciao data sets",
    "we are assuming that if there were existing polarimetric _",
    "h_-band imagery from 2004 , when the ciao data were taken , that bright regions associated with the spirals would also show a larger polarization than the surrounding disk .    figure [ spiralmove ] displays the total light _",
    "h_-band imagery from the ciao instrument ( panel a ) taken on 2004 january 8 and 11 @xcite and the _ h _ band pi imagery from the hiciao instrument ( panel b ) taken on 2009 october 31 @xcite .",
    "several spirals are easily identifiable in both data sets .",
    "therefore , we over plot the 2009 hiciao data on the 2004 ciao imagery as contours in panel c , while panel d shows the hiciao contours over plotted on the hiciao imagery for comparison .",
    "panel c shows no significant movement of any of the visible spirals over the 5.8 year baseline between our data sets .    in order to better constrain this apparent lack of spiral arm movement",
    ", we deliberately rotated our imagery in figure [ rot ] to determine what amount of rotation would have been detectable over our 5.8 year baseline . to do this , we rotated our ciao images in the counterclockwise direction in @xmath31 increments and overplotted the unrotated contours derived from the hiciao dataset .",
    "when comparing the rotated ciao imagery to the unrotated hiciao contours , the effects of the rotation can be seen relatively quickly ; it only takes @xmath31 of rotation before the s3 and s8 contours do not line up with their respective spiral structures . at @xmath32",
    "the s1 , s3 and s8 spirals all start to appear to be poorly fit , which only becomes more pronounced as the amount of rotation increases .",
    "however , a comparison of rotated hiciao imagery to unrotated hiciao contours ( not shown in figure [ rot ] ) indicates that using datasets taken with similar observing techniques might allow us to detect a smaller amount of rotation ; it only takes @xmath31 of rotation before the s1 and s8 contours do not line up with the spiral structures . needing larger rotations before the ciao data appear to not be well fit by the unrotated hiciao contours is likely due to several effects .",
    "first , the pixel scale of the ciao data is significantly larger than the hiciao data ( 21.3 mas and 9.3 mas respectively ) .",
    "therefore , it would take a larger movement of material before it is noticeable in the ciao data . also ,",
    "there are slight differences between the datasets which may hinder the detection of rotation to some effect ; the hiciao imagery is polarized intensity while the ciao imagery is unpolarized .",
    "regardless of these complexities , this analysis suggests that the s1 and s3 spiral structures have likely moved less than @xmath32 over the 5.8 year baseline because we would have otherwise detected this amount of rotation .",
    "if the spiral structures are formed due the disk - planet interactions their motion should be in sub - keplarian motion with a pattern speed given by @xmath33}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the mass of the central star , @xmath35 is the orbital radius of the planet whose perturbations would invoke the spiral structure , and @xmath36 is the gravitational constant .",
    "therefore , the orbital radius at which a planet might be located is given by @xmath37{\\left ( \\frac{360{^\\circ}}{2\\pi}\\right)^2\\frac{\\textrm{gm}_\\star}{\\omega^2}}=\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{3.107\\times 10 ^ 5}{\\omega^2}}. \\qquad \\textrm{[au]}\\ ] ] this suggests that if planets are the cause of the s1 , s3 , and s8 spirals structures , they must be in an orbit located at least 47 au from the central star .",
    "this constraint is consistent with the 80 au location of the gap which may have formed due to a planet clearing out disk material @xcite .",
    "if the disk - planet formation mechanism is correct and the planet were located in the middle of the gap at 80 au , then it would take an approximately 6.4 year baseline between epochs to see a @xmath31 rotation of the spirals ( 12.8 years for @xmath32 ) .",
    "we expect that future observations of the ab aur system using techniques similar to existing data , e.g. a second epoch of _ h _ band pi imagery , will provide more rigorous and clear constraints on the movement , or lack thereof , of the spiral arm structures .",
    "recent modeling work by @xcite shows that a 3 @xmath38 planet at approximately 67 au can excite spirals and form other structures that are very similar to those observed in ab aur . at that distance",
    "the spirals should be moving at just over @xmath39 per year .",
    "a new epoch of hiciao data taken as soon as this year should be able to determine if a planet at 67 au forms the spiral structures ; they should have moved by at least @xmath40 now .",
    "while beyond the scope of this paper , we feel that modeling of ab aur s spirals using similar techniques to those used by @xcite for the sao 206462 disk will have important implications for our understanding of the disk structure . in their work , @xcite used spiral density wave theory to predict how the future movement of the spiral patterns in sao 206462 would deviate from the local keplarian speed of the disk . in combination with future epochs of imagery , modeling such as",
    "this may further constrain or limit the potential formation scenarios for the spirals in the ab aur disk .",
    "we have used the ` hochunk3d ` monte carlo code to self - consistently model the near - ir imagery and sed of the ab aur system simultaneously .",
    "our modeling results are consistent with those already present in the literature ; a disk - dominated model reproduces many of ab aur s observed features .",
    "this suggests that a spiral formation scenario involving disk material remains a possibility for at least some of the spirals , particularly in the _ h _ band where the envelope does not significantly contribute to our model s sed or imagery .",
    "given our findings , we analyzed the 2004 and 2009 total light and pi imagery from the ciao and hiciao instruments in the _ h _ band to measure any potential rotation of the disk s spirals . in the event that the spiral structures are formed due to disk - planet interactions , the spirals movement , or lack thereof ,",
    "can constrain the locations of possible planets within the ab aur system .",
    "we find no significant rotation of any of the spiral structures over the 5.8 year baseline between these two datasets . by purposely rotating our data and comparing them to unrotated versions of the data",
    ", we find that if the spirals did move , they did so by less than @xmath32 .",
    "this suggests that if a planet were responsible for the observed structures , it is in an orbit that is least 47 au away from the central star .",
