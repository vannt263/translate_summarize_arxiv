    "a corrugated structure device  a so - called dechirper  @xcite  is being proposed for installation after the end of the linac and before the undulator regions of lcls - ii .",
    "such a device has been installed in lcls - i  @xcite , where it has been used for energy chirp control and as a fast kicker for self - seeding and two color operation of the fel  @xcite . because of the high repetition rate in lcls - ii compared to lcls - i , joule heating of the device by the beam s wakefields may now become significant and a cooling system may be required .",
    "thus , it is important to estimate the amount of joule heating power that is deposited in the corrugated plates .    in previous work ,",
    "the surface impedance approach to obtaining the impedances and wakes of a short , high energy bunch in a flat dechirper was derived  @xcite .",
    "the resulting formulas were shown to be approximate and valid in the perturbative regime , _",
    "i.e. _ when @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the corrugation depth and @xmath4 the half aperture of the dechirper . in this regime (",
    "assuming also that @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the corrugation period ) the impedance can be described by a single mode and the longitudinal wake by a damped cosine function  @xcite .",
    "the radiabeam / slac dechirper at nominal parameters ( @xmath7  mm and @xmath8  mm , thus @xmath9 ) , however , is not in the perturbative regime . in this non - perturbative regime",
    ", it has been shown that the impedance consists of more than one mode  @xcite and the wake begins with a droop  @xcite .",
    "however , even for this regime analytical fitting functions for the short - range wakes have been derived and also verified by numerical simulation  @xcite .    in previous work on the dechirper ,",
    "the effect of the corrugations alone was considered , and the effect of the resistance of the boundary metal was ignored . for joule power loss calculations , however , one needs to include both contributions . also , in most of the previous work on the impedance of a flat dechirper ,",
    "the case of the beam passing between two corrugated plates was considered . however , when used as a fast kicker , with the beam passing close to one plate , the second plate no longer influences the beam nor needs to be in the problem .",
    "note however , that analytical fitting formulas for the short - range wakes for this case have also been recently derived  @xcite , though without numerical verification .    in the present report , by applying the surface impedance approach to both double and single plate dechirpers ,",
    "we obtain analytical estimates of the joule heating power .",
    "the surface impedance approach is used where it is not quite applicable ( @xmath9 and is not small ) , introducing an error .",
    "in addition , our estimates ignore the effect of reflections from the side edges of the dechirper plates .",
    "we thus expect our results to underestimate the joule power losses .",
    "finally , we test the accuracy of these calculations , by performing numerical simulations using the time - domain maxwell equation solver in cst particle studio ( ps )  @xcite , and also ( for verification purposes ) with the program pbci  @xcite .",
    "these calculations are themselves quite challenging , since a fine mesh is needed to resolve the short bunch , and runs need to be performed over a large mesh domain for a relatively long time . in appendix",
    "b we perform numerical simulations to test the accuracy of the single plate , short - range wake formulas derived in  @xcite .",
    "the radiabeam / slac dechirper that is installed in lcls - i consists of two modules .",
    "each module has two corrugated plates , with the beam passing between them ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "two modules were chosen in order to partially cancel the unavoidable quadrupole wakefield that is induced by the beam ; one has plates parallel to the @xmath10-@xmath11 axis ( horizontal - longitudinal ) plane and is adjustable vertically ( the  vertical dechirper \" ) , and the complimentary one is adjustable horizontally ( the  horizontal dechirper \" ) . for lcls - ii ,",
    "the corrugation parameters are period @xmath12  mm , ( longitudinal ) gap @xmath13  mm , depth @xmath7  mm ; nominally the gap @xmath14  mm . the plate length @xmath15  m and width @xmath16  mm .",
    "our calculations here consider : ( i ) a vertical two - plate dechirper , with the beam on the symmetry axis ( such as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) ; and ( ii ) only the top plate , with the beam just below it .",
    "the dechirper parameters and typical beam and machine properties used in calculations here are given in table  i.     axis.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    .selected beam and machine properties for lcls - ii used in example calculations .",
    "this is the high charge option with its maximum repetition rate .",
    "the charge distribution is assumed to be uniform with peak current @xmath17  ka .",
    "the dechirper properties are those of the radiabeam / lslac dechirper , which consists of two modules , each with corrugated plates of length @xmath15  m. the plates are made of aluminum ; we take conductivity @xmath18/s . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table2_tab ]",
    "we have performed joule power loss calculations for the radiabeam / lcls - ii dechirper , whose engineering details  for example concerning the cooling required  are still being finalized .",
    "we have investigated the configurations of the beam on - axis between the two plates , for chirp control , and for the beam especially close to one plate , for use as a fast kicker .",
    "our calculations involve an analytical model that uses a surface impedance approach , valid for perturbatively small dechirper parameters in addition , our model ignores effects of field reflections at the sides of the dechirper plates , and is thus expected to underestimate the joule losses .",
    "the analytical results were also tested by numerical , time - domain simulations using computer programs in cst studio and pbci .",
    "we find that most of the wake power lost by the beam is radiated out to the sides of the plates . while our theory can be applied to the lcls - ii dechirper with large gaps , for the nominal apertures we are not in the perturbative regime and the reflection contribution to joule losses",
    "is not negligible . with input from computer simulations , we estimate the joule power loss ( assuming bunch charge of @xmath0  pc , repetition rate of @xmath1  khz ) is 21  w / m for the case of two plates , and 24  w / m for the case of a single plate .    the single - plate configuration of a dechirper has , until now , received little attention in the literature . in this report",
    "we have presented also the impedance of a beam passing by a single corrugated plate .",
    "also , in appendix  b we have numerically confirmed that the analytical expressions for short - range wakes found in ref .",
    "@xcite are valid when @xmath19 , where @xmath3 is depth of corrugation and @xmath20 is distance of beam from plate . in fact , we showed that the longitudinal and dipole ( but not quadrupole ) wakes agree well even for @xmath21 .",

    "[ ez_off_eq ] ) @xmath24 we need to calculate the following integral @xmath25 ( where we have used the fact that the integrand is symmetric with respect to @xmath26 ) . in the limit when the resistive term @xmath27 , we have @xmath28 and @xmath29 and the integral reduces to @xmath30 it is easy to see that the denominator of the integrand vanishes at @xmath31 and the integrand has a pole at this point .",
    "this pole has to be bypassed in the complex plane ( of variable @xmath26 ) or , equivalently , the integration path needs to be shifted from the real axis .",
    "the direction of the shift can be found by analyzing the position of the pole when @xmath32 is small , but not equal to zero .",
    "this analysis shows that for non - zero @xmath32 the pole has a positive imaginary part , which means that in the limit @xmath27 the integration path should be modified as shown in fig .",
