    "the structures of the cosmic mass field on scales from sub - mpc to kpc have attracted a lot of attention recently .",
    "high resolution n - body simulations show that the core profiles of massive halos of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmogony are singular ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 , moore et al .",
    "2000 , jing & suto 2000 ) , while the halo profiles required by the rotation curves of dwarf galaxies ( flores & primack 1994 , burkeret 1995 ) are shallower than the numerical results .",
    "the central cusps of dark halos also disagree with soft halo profiles inferred from low surface brightness galaxies ( de blok & mcgaugh 1997 . )",
    "the cores of galaxies and clusters are even found to be consistent with the thermal equilibrium model with an `` universal '' mass density ( firmani et al . 2000 . ) in other words , the singular behavior of cosmic clustering has not been detected in the cores of galaxies and clusters .",
    "we can now ask the question : can the singular behavior , if it exists , be revealed by methods other than the mass profile of galaxies and clusters ? at the first glance , this goal seems to be not achievable , as singular mass density profiles can only be seen in cores of galaxies and clusters . however , a random mass field @xmath2 consisting of rare singular structures randomly scattered in low mass density background typically is intermittent ( zeldovich et al . 1990 . )",
    "a basic character of an intermittent field is that the density _ difference _ between two neighboring positions , @xmath3 , can be `` abnormally '' large when @xmath4 is very small .",
    "that is , the rare events of large density difference @xmath3 on small scales @xmath4 have a higher probability than that for a gaussian field .",
    "such a singular behavior of a random mass field means that the probability density function ( pdf ) of the density differences on small scales , @xmath4 , has a long tail . obviously , the effects of long tailed pdf of the density difference are not limited to the singular mass profile .",
    "this motivated us to look for the pdf s long tail and its effects by using samples other than the cores of galaxies and clusters .",
    "the pdf s long tail have not yet been seriously studied .",
    "the most popular statistical measure of large - scale structures  the power spectrum of a mass field , is insensitive to the pdf s long tail .",
    "furthermore , the density difference , @xmath3 , is a quantity localized in space @xmath5 and on scale @xmath4 , and so a space - scale decomposition is necessary . thus using the power spectrum or any statistic that is not based on proper space - scale decomposition ,",
    "it is not possible to identify the effects of long - tailed pdf of the density difference .    in this _",
    "letter _ , using a discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) , we look for the long tail effects from a sample of qso s ly@xmath0 forests .",
    "it is believed that the distribution of baryonic diffuse matter is almost point - by - point proportional to the underlying dark matter density .",
    "moreover , the absorption optical depth of ly@xmath0 is linearly dependent on the baryonic density .",
    "therefore , the high resolution data of the transmitted flux of qso s absorption would be a good candidate to reveal the long - tailed pdf of cosmic mass field on small scales .",
    "let us consider a 1-d random mass density field @xmath2 in spatial range @xmath6 . with a dwt space - scale decomposition , the local density difference , @xmath3 ,",
    "is represented by the wavelet function coefficients ( wfcs ) as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the orthonormal and complete basis of the discrete wavelet transform , and @xmath9 is the inner product ( daubechies , 1992 . )",
    "we use daub4 wavelet ( press et al .",
    "1993 , nielsen 1998 ) for our analysis through out this _ letter_.",
    "the wfc , @xmath10 , is the density fluctuation on the scale @xmath11 at the position @xmath12 , or the mean density difference between nearest neighbors ranging on scale @xmath11 at @xmath13 . if the ",
    "fair sample hypothesis \" ( peebles 1980 ) holds , then the @xmath14 values of @xmath10 form an ensemble of the density differences on scale @xmath15 , and therefore , the distribution of @xmath10 is a reasonable estimate of the pdf of the density differences on scale @xmath15 ( fang & thews 1998 . )    the second order statistics @xmath16 describes the power of the perturbations of the mode @xmath17 . in other words , at a given position @xmath13 , the local power spectrum is given by @xmath18 by averaging @xmath19 over all positions @xmath13 , we have @xmath20 it has been shown that @xmath21 actually is a band - averaged fourier power spectrum ( pando & fang 1998 ; fang & feng 2000 . )    the fourier power spectrum lacks phase information , and therefore , @xmath21 can not show the phase - related features of clustering .",
    "however , @xmath19 is phase - sensitive .",
    "one can search for the phase - related features of the mass field by _ local _ dwt power spectrum @xmath19 .",
    "we can generalize the definition of local dwt power spectrum , eq.(2 ) as follows .",
    "first we chop @xmath6 into @xmath22 sub - interval , labeled by @xmath23 .",
    "each sub - interval has a length @xmath24 .",
    "then , the local dwt power spectrum at sub - interval @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 it is the power on scale @xmath11 localized on @xmath25 with size @xmath24 .",
    "for a gaussian field , the local power spectrum @xmath19 will not show structures with respect to @xmath13 . on the other hand ,",
    "the singular behavior of a random field is measured by the exponent @xmath0 defined by @xmath27 .",
    "the larger the @xmath0 is , the smoother the field on small scales is , and vice versa . if the exponent @xmath0 is negative there are an actual singularity of the field .",
    "therefore , the singular behavior can be revealed by the roughness of the local power spectrum on small scales .",
    "the wfc local power spectrum can also measure the index @xmath28 of power - law profile @xmath29 for individual core .",
    "the sample used for the analysis is the ly@xmath0 transmitted flux of qso hs1700 + 64 .",
    "this sample has been employed to study the evolution of structure ( bi & davidsen 1997 ) , the fourier and dwt power spectra ( feng & fang 2000 . )",
    "the recovered power spectrum has been found to be consistent with the cdm model on scales larger than about 0.1 @xmath1 mpc .",
    "the data ranges from 3727.012   to 5523.554   with a resolution of @xmath30 kms@xmath31 , for a total of 55882 pixels . in this paper , we use the first 25000 pixels for analysis , which correspond to @xmath32 2.07@xmath33 2.65 , or @xmath34",
    "3727.012  @xmath33  4434.266 . on average ,",
    "a pixel is about 0.029 , equivalent to physical size @xmath35 @xmath1 kpc at @xmath36 for a flat universe .",
    "we pad 7768 null pixels at the end to utilize a fast wavelet transform algorithm , which requires the data size in powers of 2",
    ". it does not affect the analysis , because the wavelet transform is localized .",
    "moreover , we subject dwt directly to pixels without transforming them to physical positions .",
    "the relation between pixel number and physical position is not linear , but it does not affect structures on small scales .",
    "thus , we ignore the effect of the non - linear relation in our present analysis .",
    "most lines in the ly@xmath0 transmitted flux are due to absorptions by gases in cool and low density regions .",
    "the pressure gradients are generally less than gravitational forces .",
    "that is , the gas , and hence the transmitted flux , should be good tracer of the dark matter .",
    "nevertheless , small scale structures of the dark matter field may be smoothed out by the velocity dispersion of ly@xmath0 forest gases .",
    "therefore , to identify the clustering feature , we will statistically compare the real data with its phase - randomized counterpart , which is obtained by taking the inverse transform of the fourier coefficients of the original data after randomizing their phases uniformly over @xmath37 $ ] without changing their amplitudes .      in fig . 1",
    ", we show the pdfs of the wfcs for @xmath38 , and 14 .",
    "each pdf is normalized to have unit variance . for scale @xmath38 ,",
    "the departure from gaussian distribution is not so significant . especially , no tail shows in the @xmath38 pdf , i.e. no wfcs found to be @xmath39 . for j = 14",
    ", the pdf of wfcs has @xmath40 events .",
    "therefore , if the pdf were gaussian , the number of the events larger than 3@xmath41 would be about 44 .",
    "however , the data shows 234 events beyond the 3@xmath41 range .",
    "furthermore , a gaussian pdf predicts that the number of the events larger than 5@xmath41 should be 0.01 , while the data shows more than 100 events larger than 5@xmath41 .",
    "the data extends to beyond 15@xmath41 on both sides .",
    "therefore , the pdf is indeed significantly long - tailed on small scales . in other words ,",
    "the field is rougher on smaller scales .",
    "this indicates that the field may contain singular structures .",
    "the shape of the two pdfs of @xmath38 and 14 is very different from each other .",
    "that is , the two stochastic variables @xmath10 , @xmath42 do nt relate to each other as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a constant .",
    "therefore , the mass field traced by the qso hs1700 + 64 is unlikely to be self - similar .      in fig .",
    "2 we plot the local dwt power spectra of the hs1700 + 64 transmitted flux and its phase - randomized counterpart .",
    "we take @xmath45 , i.e. chopping the entire sample into 128 sub - intervals , and , in each sub - interval , calculating the power spectra for @xmath46 @xmath33 14 , which correspond to physical scales @xmath47 @xmath1 kpc .    fig .",
    "2 shows that the @xmath38 local power spectrum for real data is not very different from its phase - randomized counterpart .",
    "this is consistent with the @xmath38 pdf shown in fig.1 .",
    "it is closer - to - gaussian . while the @xmath48 @xmath33 @xmath49 local spectra are very rough , showing remarkably spiky structures , that completely disappear in the phase randomized counterpart .",
    "the spiky features mean that a significant part of the power is concentrated in some small areas .",
    "this feature is a result of the long tailed pdf of the density difference , i.e. , higher probability of `` abnormal '' density change .",
    "the smaller the scale , the more pronounced the spiky features .",
    "this , again , points to a singular clustering of cosmic mass field .    it should be emphasized that the spikes in the local power spectrum with high @xmath15 do _ not _ always correspond to the peaks in the density distribution ( or the absorption lines in the optical spectrum ) .",
    "the wfcs @xmath10 describe the _ difference _ in density between intervals of length @xmath50 @xmath1 mpc .",
    "the average of @xmath10 over @xmath13 generally is zero .",
    "the mean power ( or variance ) at @xmath51 is @xmath52 .",
    "thus , even a single event @xmath53 at @xmath51 does nt always refer to high density , and it can happen in regions other than high density cores .",
    "the spikes denote the positions where the density ( or the absorption optical depth ) undergoes a dramatic change , which is the key indicator of the singular behavior of a random field .",
    "the wavelet functions @xmath54 are orthogonal , and therefore , the local power spectrum on scale @xmath15 does nt contaminate perturbations on other scales .",
    "this is very different from the density distribution smoothed by a window function on scale @xmath15 .",
    "the peaks identified from the window - function smoothed density field contain all contributions from perturbations on scales @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , the peaks in a smoothed field are actually given by a superposition of perturbations on large and small scales .",
    "they may not show singular features , because the pdfs of large scale ( or @xmath56 ) perturbations are closer to gaussian .",
    "we should estimate the possible distortion of the long tail effects caused by velocity dispersion of gases .",
    "we calculated the @xmath51 local power spectrum with sub - interval @xmath57 , which is plotted in fig .",
    "this local power spectrum has almost the same spiky features identified in the @xmath58 spectrum ( see , fig .",
    "that is , most spikes shown by the power localized in sub - interval with size of about 600 @xmath1 kpc actually are localized in sub - interval with size only about few 10 @xmath1 kpc .",
    "this result indicates that the contamination of gas velocity dispersion may not be significant , at least , for prominent spikes .",
    "thus , the spiky structures should mainly come from the underlying mass field .",
    "intermittency can more clearly be seen in fig .",
    "the mean powers [ eq.(3 ) ] of the real data ( left panel ) and randomized counterpart ( right panel ) of the @xmath57 and @xmath51 local spectrum actually are the same , while the spikes of the real data are higher than the mean power by a factor of few tens even hundreds .",
    "that is , in the real sample , most power of the @xmath51 perturbations is concentrated in the spikes , and almost no power , i.e. @xmath59 , in places other than the spikes .",
    "this is a typical intermittent distribution .",
    "with the pdfs of @xmath10 and local dwt power spectra , we show that the mass field traced by the qso hs1700 + 64 ly@xmath0 forests is neither gaussian , nor self - similar , but intermittent .",
    "the spiky features shown in the local dwt power spectrum is remarkably pronounced on scales down to about 10 @xmath1 kpc .",
    "moreover , the long tail and the spiky features are substantial on smaller scales .",
    "this indicates that the cosmic mass field is rougher on smaller scales , consistent with singular clustering .",
    "a big advantage of intermittency is that one can detect singular clustering using the statistical features of entire random density field , not limited to the cores of galaxies and clusters .",
    "the information of intermittency extracted from ly@xmath0 forests would be important to test models of cosmic clustering in terms of their singular behavior ."
