    "we present a study of global warming based on the data obtained at @xmath0 weather stations covering the period from 1702 to 1990 . in particular we are interested in finding the effect of human activity on global warming .",
    "since the world population doubled from 1952 to 1990 , we search for any changes in the trend of global warming between the first and second halves of the 20th century .",
    "the data used in this study is described in section 2 , the analysis is presented in section 3 and the conclusions are collected in section 4 .",
    "the temperature data set used in this analysis is `` released in 1997.@xcite this data is a '' in particular we used the `` ( in file ) and the '' ( in file ) .",
    "each station is labeled by a @xmath4 digit code .",
    "we define a `` for a particular station as a year that has all twelve months with valid mean temperatures .",
    "we average these twelve monthly temperatures to obtain the '' for that station . in figures [ 617103840000 ] , [ 633062600000 ] and",
    "[ 646067000000 ] we present the mean annual temperatures @xmath5 of the three oldest stations using the \" set . in figure",
    "[ 306840710000 ] we present the corresponding temperatures of our home city quito .",
    "we fit these temperatures to a straight line .",
    "the slopes @xmath6 for the period covered by the data are shown in the figure captions .",
    "all errors in this article are statistical and one standard deviation or @xmath7 confidence",
    ". the high slope of the temperature measured in quito may be due to the fact that the city grew around the weather station .",
    "figure [ global_warming_raw ] presents global warming at - a - glance .",
    "this figure was obtained as follows .",
    "we consider stations that have the first valid year less than or equal to 1900 and the last valid year greater than or equal to 1990 .",
    "furthermore we require at least 85 valid years between 1900 and 1990 inclusive .",
    "we chose these stations to be able to make meaningfull comparisons of global warming between the first and second halves of the 20th century .",
    "we define the `` of a station to be the average temperature of valid years between 1945 and 1955 inclusive ( so at least one valid year in this interval is required ) .",
    "in figure [ global_warming_raw ] we present the difference between the average temperature per 5 year bin and the reference temperature , averaged over all stations in the '' set passing the selection criteria . in figure",
    "[ global_warming_adjusted ] we present the corresponding information for the \" set .    from these figures",
    "we see that the global temperature has been increasing since the earliest measurements in 1702 .",
    "we see no acceleration of global warming in the second half of the 20th century compared to the first half .",
    "the data shown in figures [ global_warming_raw ] and [ global_warming_adjusted ] are dominated by stations in the usa as can be seen in figure [ usa ] .",
    "however , the general conclusions , _",
    "i.e. _ warming since the earliest measurements and no acceleration of the warming in the second half of the 20th century , can be observed elsewhere as shown in figures [ germany ] to [ sweeden ] .",
    "the mean annual temperature of a station fluctuates from year to year by typically @xmath8c ( one standard deviation ) .",
    "superimposed on this fluctuation is a linear increase of temperature by typically @xmath9c per century ever since reliable data is available , _",
    "i.e. _ since 1702 , as shown in figure [ global_warming_raw ] .",
    "all errors are statistical only , one standard deviation .",
    "the world population has * doubled * from 1952 to 1990 as seen in figure [ pobl ] , yet we see no statistically significant acceleration of global warming in that period : see figures [ global_warming_raw ] to [ sweeden ] . we conclude that the effect of humankind on global warming up to 1990 is @xmath3c . therefore ,",
    "contrary to popular belief , the data support the view that human activity has had no significant effect on global warming up to the year 1990 covered by this study .",
