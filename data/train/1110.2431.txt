    "the errors in the highest energy matrix element @xmath121 are on the order of 5 % . the middle matrix element ( not shown ) is exact and constant because this eigenstate is also an eigenstate of @xmath73 .",

    "the primary discrepancy between the master equation predictions and exact results thus arises in the off - diagonal elements in the long time limit .",
    "moreover , the corresponding discrepancy in the purity suggests that these errors arise from problems with the dissipative terms in the sme . since the results change little when we arbitrarily set @xmath127 we also know that the inhomogeneous term is not the source of error .",
    "we noticed an unexpected error arising in the eigenvalues of the density matrix computed using the sme master equation .",
    "one eigenvalue should remain zero at all times but we discovered that it becomes slightly negative at short times but then returns to zero .",

    "it does not seem likely that numerical errors of this type are responsible for the discrepancies between the exact and master equation results .",
    "the synthetic approach introduced in this paper yields a well defined master equation with no free parameters which preserves positivity and correctly equilibrates to a long time limit which commutes with the shifted native system hamiltonian and which depends at most on the diagonal elements of the initial density in the hamiltonian eigenbasis .",
    "numerical tests for a model system consisting of an nv center in diamond interacting with @xmath0c impurities show good accuracy at short and intermediate times .",
    "the diagonal elements of the density in the shifted native hamiltonian eigenbasis are also in good agreement with exact results at long times .",
    "there is however a serious problem with the off - diagonal elements . in",
    "a frame rotating with the native hamiltonian the exact results show persistent oscillations with a period of about 10 @xmath79s , while the master equation results decay to zero quite rapidly",
