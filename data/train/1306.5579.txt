    "many x - ray clusters are found around radio galaxies with large - scale radio structures which in majority are classified as fris @xcite with a smaller number of friis @xcite .",
    "these radio sources are old ( @xmath10 years ) and their long term interaction with the cluster environment imprinted a rich variety of structures into the x - ray morphology , such as bubbles , shock fronts and ripples @xcite .",
    "however , little is known about the nature of the x - ray clusters associated with young compact radio sources ( with radio source sizes @xmath11kpc ) , namely the gigahertz peaked spectrum ( gps ) and compact steep spectrum ( css ) objects .",
    "these young ( age @xmath12years ) radio sources are believed to be at the beginning of their evolution @xcite .",
    "if they reside in clusters the inter - cluster medium ( icm ) should have not been impacted by the radio source and we could observe a primordial x - ray morphology of the cluster medium .",
    "in addition the observation of the cluster medium can provide important information about the physical properties and evolution of the radio source itself .",
    "however , searches for luminous x - ray clusters associated with gps and css objects were typically unsuccessful @xcite .    the only bright x - ray cluster known to host a css source is 3c186 discovered by @xcite .",
    "it is a well formed cool core x - ray cluster at high redshift , @xmath13 .",
    "the central cluster galaxy hosts a radio - loud quasar with a powerful frii - type small - scale radio morphology indicating the initial phase of its evolution .",
    "while expanding into the cluster medium , the young radio source can potentially supply the energy required to stabilize the cluster core against catastrophic cooling .",
    "however , the high redshift location of this source limits the investigation of the interactions between the radio source and the icm .",
    "we discovered an x - ray emission from the galaxy cluster , maxbcg j201.08197 + 04.31863 @xcite in our _ chandra _ observation of a low power css radio source , 1321 + 045 at @xmath0 . here , we present the analysis of the x - ray cluster emission together with the analysis of the radio , optical and x - ray properties of the radio source 1321 + 045 .",
    "this is the second css source known to be associated with the large x - ray cluster .",
    "it has a different radio morphology than the 3c186 ( fri vs. frii - like ) and it is much less luminous in radio .",

    "the _ chandra _  acis - s observation of 1321 + 045 was part of a small snapshot program targeting seven low radio power css sources ( in preparation ) .",
    "it was performed on 2011 - 12 - 14 .",
    "the source was placed at the aim point on the back - illuminated acis ccd ( s3 ) and the observation was made in faint mode with 1/8 ccd readout to avoid pileup .",
    "we used ciao 4.4 @xcite and caldb 4.5 in all the data analysis and _ sherpa _",
    "@xcite for modeling and fitting ( cstat with simplex method ) .",
    "we reprocessed the data using chandra_repro to apply the most recent instrument calibration .",
    "the script runs acis_process_events which applies the sub - pixel algorithm and gives the best spatial resolution images . after the standard deadtime correction of 9.4%",
    "the effective exposure time on the source was 9.5ksec .",
    "the x - ray centroid is located at @xmath26 ( j2000.0 ) .",
    "the x - ray diffuse emission covers a large part of the acis - s ccd with the radio source located in the center ( figure  [ fig : cluster ] ) . the smoothed x - ray image overlayed with radio contours shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster ] seems to suggest a broad enhanced x - ray emission with two peaks in the vicinity of the core .",
    "offsets between the radio core and the enhancements are consistent with the astrometric uncertainty of _ chandra _  and we did not attempt to apply any additional adjustments .",
    "the adjustment to the aspect solution might be possible with a deeper observations in the future if there are additional point sources detected in this field .",
    "the x - ray cluster emission extends outside the field of view of the ccd .",
    "however , we measured the extent along the ccd using the surface brightness profiles towards the north and south from the center .",
    "we used dmextract and extracted one - dimensional radial profiles assuming 18 annuli located between 3and 100within pa angles of 70 - 150and 260 - 335 .",
    "the cluster emission is detected at 3@xmath27 level out to about @xmath28 ( @xmath3240kpc ) from the radio source .",
    "we fit the two profiles in _ sherpa _ assuming a beta1d model and obtained the core radius of @xmath29  arcsec and @xmath30-parameter of 0.58@xmath31 .",
    "the extrapolation of the beta1 model into the circular ( @xmath32 ) region centered on the radio source shows the excess x - ray emission .",
    "we associate this emission with the radio source .",
    "we used specextract tool to extract the x - ray spectra assuming 1.25  radius circle for the radio source and an annulus with inner and outer radii equal to 1.5  and 10  respectively for the local background .",
    "this region encloses the radio core and a part of the innermost radio structure .",
    "the x - ray spectrum contains 36.1@xmath33 net counts ( 53 total ) in the 0.5 - 7  kev energy range .",
    "the cluster emission contributes to this spectrum and we need to take it into account in the further modeling of the source spectrum . in the modeling we kept the absorption parameter at the galactic value of @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "we first fit the background spectrum assuming the apec model in _ sherpa _",
    "( this is the cluster emission within 1.5  and 10  annulus ) .",
    "we set the metal abundance to 30% of the solar values and @xmath0 for this model and fit the spectrum containing 1054 counts in 0.5 - 7kev range .",
    "the resulting best fit temperature and normalization are @xmath35  kev and @xmath36 respectively and represent the average observed values of the central region of the cluster .",
    "we expect only about 16@xmath37 counts from the cluster to contribute to the _ chandra_spectrum of the radio source .",
    "these background model parameters remained unchanged in fitting the spectrum of the radio source described below .",
    "we assumed an absorbed powerlaw emission model for the radio source and the apec model with the fixed parameters to the above best fit values to account for the cluster emission .",
    "the resulting best fit power law photon index is equal to @xmath38 and the normalization to @xmath39  photons  @xmath40  s@xmath41 at 1 kev .",
    "the model unabsorbed flux of @xmath42  erg  @xmath43  s@xmath41 corresponds to the luminosity @xmath44  erg  s@xmath41 typical for a low luminosity agn .",
    "the photon index , however , is quite steep and may indicate a presence of soft thermal emission often observed in low luminosity agn and explained as a result of hot ism of the host galaxy or a jet emission @xcite . a higher quality spectrum is needed to understand the origin of this emission .",
    "we detected 2882.2@xmath45 net counts within the circular region with 38.2  radius in the _ chandra _  9.7  ksec observation .",
    "the cluster is bright in x - rays and we attempted to obtain the cluster s temperature profile by fitting the spectra of three annuli centered on the radio source .",
    "the three annuli span the cluster emission between 2  and 28  and the fourth one between 28  and 35  accounts for the background ( see table 1 ) .",

    "there is no evidence of jets or hotspots , however , this needs to be confirmed by observations at higher frequency .",
    "a total projected length of the source is equal to @xmath55kpc and its radio luminosity , @xmath56w  @xmath57 ( @xmath58erg  @xmath59 ) , places it in the fri - frii transition region .",
    "studies of compact radio sources suggest that they exhibit periodic activity on timescales of @xmath60 years @xcite . on shorter timescales",
    "the radio source is not able to escape from the host galaxy and starts to recollapse within the ism @xcite .",
    "our analysis of the whole sample of llc sources suggest that they can represent a population of short - lived objects and undergo this phase of activity many times before they become large scale fri or frii @xcite . what is more , the evolution of the radio source and its radio morphology is determined by the properties of the central engine : strength , accretion mode , excitation level of the ionized gas , and the ism .",

    "we found that the emission line ratios of 1312 + 045 are consistent with agn - dominated photoionization with small contributions from star - formation models .",
    "none of the shock models ( with and without precursor ) reproduce the flux ratios , suggesting that jet - induced shocks are not present in the ism of 1321 + 045 or their contribution to the ionization of the optically emitting gas is negligible",
    ".      the presence of distortions and cavities in the x - ray image of a cluster can signal interactions between the central galaxy ( the radio source ) and the icm @xcite .",
    "some clusters have multiple pairs of cavities filled with low frequency radio emission , probably caused by the previous radio activity phase .",
    "the high resolution radio observations show that the reborn radio source can reside inside the cluster core and multiple cavities provide the evidence for the previous outbursts @xcite . figure  [ fig : cluster ] shows x - ray emission from the 1321 + 045 cluster in 0.5 - 7kev energy range overlayed with radio contours from the merlin 1.6ghz observations .",
    "there is no presence of any ripples and discontinuities in the current x - ray image of a 1321 + 045 cluster but rather uniform emission without indications of an interaction with the radio jets , or any signature of the previous activity .",
    "inspection of the vlss image of 1321 + 045 at 74mhz @xcite shows that the low frequency emission extends out to @xmath3120kpc .",
    "this low frequency radio emission is uniform and there is no trace of more extended components which could indicate the older phase of radio activity .",
    "the synchrotron spectrum of 1321 + 045 consist of four points and is steep from 74mhz to 5ghz with the index @xmath65 ( defined as @xmath66 ) .",
    "we used a simple model of synchrotron emission @xcite to reproduce the observed spectrum in order to find the value of the magnetic field .",
    "we took the size of the radio lobe , assumed an equipartition between the particle energy and the magnetic field energy and a value of the doppler factor @xmath67 .",
    "we obtained the best fit value of @xmath68 which gives the magnetic pressure in each radio lobe to be @xmath69 .",
    "based on the cluster central density and temperature we estimate a central thermal pressure of @xmath70 .",
    "taking into account the uncertainties in determining the deprojected temperature and density ( only three annuli ) and the value of the thermal pressure we conclude that the cluster environment could limit the growth of the weak radio source .",
    "given the value of the magnetic field and the spectrum break frequency , @xmath71 we can estimate the synchrotron age of the source 1321 + 045 .",
    "the break frequency indicates the critical point in which the radio spectrum changes its spectral index and the value of @xmath71 depends on the elapsed time since the source formation @xcite . in the case of older objects the break frequency is moved toward lower frequencies .",
    "the synchrotron spectrum of 1321 + 045 does not show the self - absorption peak or the break frequency in the range 74mhz@xmath725ghz .",
    "we suggest that the well - known electron self - absorption process modifies the index of the synchrotron emission of 1321 + 045 below the 74mhz .",
    "however , since this assumption is based on a small number of spectral points we consider two cases in our calculation of the spectral age of the source : the break frequency is higher than 5ghz or lower than 74mhz .",
    "this gives us a synchrotron age of 1321 + 045 in the order of @xmath73 and @xmath74 years , respectively .",
    "the @xmath71 lower than 74mhz indicates that the population of electrons has cooled down to low energies and the source after a typical for css sources lifetime ( @xmath60 years ) started to fade away . as we already suggested the evolutionary paths of young radio agns",
    "are probably determined by the properties of their central engines , namely the heg / leg path @xcite . however , in some objects the surrounding environment could be also an important factor influencing the evolution .",
    "1321 + 045 is the first low power css leg with fri - like radio morphology discovered to be embedded in an x - ray cluster .",
    "the other css source , 3c186 @xcite has powerful jets and hotspots that are characteristic of friis .",
    "the radio observations of 1321 + 045 show a weak radio core and a symmetric diffuse emission from radio lobes without any compact features .",
    "there are no distortions and cavities in our current x - ray image of the cluster and deeper _ chandra _ observations are required to confirm this result . the optical analysis rule out the presence of jet - induced shocks in the ism of 1321 + 045 .",
