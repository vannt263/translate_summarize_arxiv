    "some physical systems are known to exhibit remarkably sharp , and yet continuous , transitions between the ordered and paramagnetic phase .",
    "the most prominent example of these are liquid crystals , systems which combine order like that found in solids with fluidity like that of liquids .",
    "liquid crystals , generally modeled as systems of ` hard - rods ' , typically exhibit a transition between a phase with no orientational or translational order and a phase where an ordered structure appears .",
    "the nature of this transition ( continuous vs discontinuous ) is an important aspect in practical applications .",
    "one of the most successful models that is able to capture the main characteristics of this transition was introduced by lebwohl and lasher in 1973 @xcite . in this model",
    "the microscopic degrees of freedom @xmath0 take real values in the interval @xmath1 , representing the orientation of rod @xmath2 relative to some fixed reference point . to model the sharp transition , the coupling energy between any pair of rods is taken to have the shape of a deep and narrow well .",
    "this energy is taken to be @xmath3 for any pair of rods @xmath4 where @xmath5 represents the strength of the interaction and the function @xmath6 denotes a @xmath7-th order legendre polynomial . in the context of ` hard - rods ' ,",
    "@xmath7 is taken to be even to enforce invariance of the energy @xmath8 under the transformation @xmath9 .",
    "the value of @xmath7 plays a crucial role in the nature of the phase transition @xcite .",
    "generally , this model has been the subject of a significant amount of research ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) .    in this paper",
    "we study the lebwohl - lasher model on a sparse graph motivated both by the interesting nature of the transition and the relative scarcity of analytic results .",
    "our approach can be viewed as the bethe approximation to the finite dimensional problem , whereby for every site there is an explicit local neighborhood . at equilibrium",
    "our analysis follows the finite connectivity ( as opposed to fully - connected mean field ) theory @xcite as developed for real - valued spin systems @xcite . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "we are able to solve this model exactly and derive expressions describing the bifurcation lines in the phase diagram .",
    "numerical evaluation of the order parameters agrees well with the results of the bifurcation analysis and shows that the phase transition , although sharp , is second - order .",
    "comparison of the above analytic results with simulation ( langevin ) expreriments shows excellent agreement .",
    "we have also studied the dynamics of this model . here",
    ", in contrast to the thermodynamic analysis which follows a well - studied framework , the terrain of the finite - connectivity dynamics is much less explored .",
    "some recent advances are the papers @xcite . in the present study we have chosen to extend the results of @xcite in order to account for the continuous nature of the spin variables . as in the dynamical replica theory of @xcite on which our analysis is based",
    ", we arrived at closed equations by assuming equipartitioning of the microscopic state probability within the observable subshells .",
    "the resulting analytic description is in good agreement with langevin simulation for small and very large times , but not sufficiently accurate for intermediate times .",
    "this is an artifact of the equipartitioning ansatz and the truncation of the set of observables to a relatively small ( and computationally tractable ) set .",
    "the model consists of @xmath10 microscopic variables @xmath11 representing the angular phase of oscillators relative to a fixed frame of reference . at equilibrium",
    "the system is described by the hamiltonian @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes a graph instance of a set of vertices @xmath14 and edges @xmath15 . the function @xmath6 denotes a @xmath7-th order legendre polynomial .",
    "the thermal variables take values from the interval @xmath16 for all @xmath17 .",
    "we also introduced the ` disorder ' angle variables @xmath18 which represent locally preferred orientations between sites @xmath2 and @xmath19 . in a physical scenario",
    "these are induced by the presence of impurities , cavities , or other heterogeneities .",
    "we will assume that the distribution of these variables is for all @xmath20 given by @xmath21 for some @xmath22 . a more general treatment is straightforward provided that the detailed balance condition is met .",
    "for each spin in the system we assign a local neighborhood , i.e. a set of sites to which the spin is connected .",
    "let us for simplicity abbreviate this set using @xmath23 , with @xmath24 representing the size of the neighbourhood of @xmath2 .",
    "our graph is characterized by the ` degree ' distribution @xmath25 moments of this distribution will be denoted @xmath26 .",
    "we draw graphs uniformly from the ensemble of all graphs that have this given degree distribution , i.e. we use the configuration model @xcite . in the thermodynamic limit this leads to interactions on a sparse graph for which the bethe approximation is exact .",
    "to evaluate thermodynamic properties and the phase diagram of this system we have two main analytic tools at hand : the replica @xcite and the cavity method @xcite . both of these have been used widely in a variety of settings , both in infinite- and finite - connectivity systems .",
    "although the underlying philosophy of the two methods is different they deliver identical results . in this paper",
    "we will choose to follow the cavity method as developed for real - valued variables in @xcite .",
    "the starting point of this method is to consider the marginal probability of finding a spin at site @xmath2 in state @xmath0 .",
    "this follows from @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the appropriate normalisation constant .",
    "@xmath29 is the joint probability of finding the neighbours of @xmath2 in state @xmath30 in the absence of site @xmath2 . to understand the origin of this expression we imagine an iterative process that creates an exact tree structure in which each spin is connected to @xmath31 neighbours apart from the site at the top of the tree which has @xmath32 neighbours .",
    "at each step of this process we add a new spin to the system by bringing together @xmath32 independent branches and connecting the top site of each of these to the new site .",
    "since , the @xmath32 branches influence each other only through the new site that has been added , we can view the probability @xmath29 as the _ a priori _ probability of finding @xmath33 before the addition of the new spin , whereas the boltzmann factor accounts for the energetic cost of the merging .",
    "since before the addition of the new site into the system , the @xmath32 branches were independent we can factorize @xmath29 : @xmath34 this equation is the bethe approximation and is exact , by construction , on trees . for random graph structures where loops ,",
    "although predominantly long ( e.g. scaling as @xmath35 on erds - reyni random graphs ) , do exist , ( [ eq : bethe ] ) is _ approximately _ correct .",
    "equation ( [ eq : true ] ) is not closed as it relates the _ true _ probability distribution with the _ cavity _ probability distribution . to close it",
    "we simply remove a neighbour of @xmath2 which leads to @xmath36 the two types of distributions that appear above can be dealt with either ( i ) by an explicit parametrization , namely setting @xmath37 ( and similarly for @xmath38 ) where @xmath39 play the role of cavity fields @xcite or ( ii ) by using a simple histogram for each of the distibutions . note that since spins are continuous variables , we are in principle required to introduce an infinite number of cavity fields .",
    "for all practical purposes however , one truncates the number of fields , while in some cases appropriate choices for the parameterization can be made which ensure that the impact of the truncation is not significant @xcite .",
    "the histogram method of course requires advanced computational power since one needs to allocate memory space for a relatively large number of bins , but this approach has the advantage of working directly with the distributions .",
    "once the stationary values of ( [ eq : cavity ] ) are known for all @xmath17 and @xmath40 we can evaluate the true probability function ( [ eq : true ] ) and subsequently observables in the system , e.g. the ` magnetizations ' @xmath41 and similarly for other order parameters .      to perform a bifurcation analysis of this system",
    "it is convenient to work with a graph ensemble , i.e. the set of all instance graphs @xmath42 with the given degree distribution ( [ eq : degree_dist ] ) .",
    "we now consider the population of the cavity probability distributions in the graph for all sites .",
    "this defines a functional density in the following way @xmath43=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac1n\\sum_{i}\\frac{1}{|\\partial i|}\\sum_{j\\in\\partial i}\\delta_{(f)}\\left[p(\\phi)-p_i^{(j)}(\\phi)\\right ] \\label{eq : w_def}\\ ] ] where by @xmath44 we mean a functional delta distribution in the sense that @xmath45=\\int dg\\,w[g]\\,\\delta_{(f)}[g(x)-f(x)]$ ] .",
    "similarly , for the density of true probability distributions @xmath46=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac1n\\sum_i\\delta_{(f)}\\left[p(\\phi)-p_i(\\phi)\\right ] \\label{eq : wtrue_def}\\ ] ] we can now convert ( [ eq : true ] ) and ( [ eq : cavity ] ) into self - consistent equations for ( [ eq : w_def ] ) and ( [ eq : wtrue_def ] ) for the ensemble of graphs with degree distribution @xmath47 @xmath48&=&\\sum_{k\\geq 0}\\frac{p(k)k}{\\bra k\\ket}\\ , \\int \\prod_{\\ell=1}^{k-1 } [ \\{\\d p_\\ell\\ }   w[\\{p_\\ell\\}]\\,\\d\\omega_\\ell\\,k(\\omega_\\ell)]\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times\\ \\delta_{(f)}\\left[p(\\psi)-\\frac{1}{\\mathcal{z}}\\,\\prod_{\\ell=1}^{k-1 } \\int \\rmd \\psi'\\ p_\\ell(\\psi')\\ \\e^{\\beta jl_p\\left(\\cos(\\psi-\\psi'-\\omega_{\\ell})\\right)}\\right ] \\label{eq : self_w}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the appropriate normalization constant .",
    "the prefactor @xmath50 expresses the fact that the probability that any given site is chosen to become a cavity site is proportional to the number of bonds it has . for the density of true probability distributions",
    "we have @xmath51&=&\\sum_{k\\geq 0}p(k)\\ , \\int \\prod_{\\ell=1}^{k } [ \\{\\d p_\\ell\\ }   w[\\{p_\\ell\\}]\\,\\d\\omega_\\ell\\,k(\\omega_\\ell)]\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times\\ \\delta_{(f)}\\left[p(\\psi)-\\frac{1}{\\mathcal{z}_{\\rm true}}\\,\\prod_{\\ell=1}^{k } \\int \\rmd \\psi'\\ p_\\ell(\\psi')\\ \\e^{\\beta jl_p\\left(\\cos(\\psi-\\psi'-\\omega_{\\ell})\\right)}\\right ] \\label{eq : self_w}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that so far we did not need to make a choice for the order of the legendre polynomial .",
    "one special case of the above equations is in the absence of angular disorder and for a fixed degree distribution @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in this case",
    "we have a @xmath54-regular graph in which virtually every spin is living in an identical environment and one solution of ( [ eq : self_w ] ) is @xmath55=\\delta[p(\\phi)-p_\\star(\\phi)]$ ] for some @xmath56 . in the case where the order of the legendre polynomial is @xmath57 ,",
    "so that @xmath58 and the degree distribution is poisson , our equations reduce identically to those of @xcite derived via the replica formalism .    equation ( [ eq : self_w ] ) can be solved in a spirit similar to the ` population dynamics ' method @xcite . as discussed in the previous section , since @xmath55 $ ] is a measure over distributions we can encode each of these distributions using a simple histogram .",
    "once a stationary solution for the @xmath55 $ ] has been obtained one can proceed to evaluate observables .",
    "for example , observables describing magnetization and spin - glass order respectively follow from @xmath59 \\int \\d \\phi p(\\phi ) \\cos(k\\phi ) \\label{eq : mc}\\\\ q_c^{(k)}&=&\\int \\{\\d f\\}w_{\\rm true}[\\{p\\ } ] \\left[\\int \\d \\phi p(\\phi ) \\cos(k\\phi)\\right]^2 \\label{eq : qc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the order parameters ( [ eq : mc],[eq : qc ] ) have the physical meaning @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes thermal averages ( similarly for @xmath62 and @xmath63 as averages over @xmath64 ) .",
    "generally , the relevant set of observables depends ( among other factors ) on the particular value of @xmath7 .",
    "this is accounted by the dependence of the above on the variable @xmath65 .",
    "one can combine the above observables into a single pair e.g. via @xmath66 for even values of @xmath7 there is no net magnetization in the system , i.e. @xmath67 , since the hamiltonian is then rotationally invariant via a uniform rotation of all spins through @xmath68 .      to perform a bifurcation analysis",
    ", we notice that @xmath55=\\delta_{(f)}\\left[p(\\phi)-\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\right]$ ] satisfies ( [ eq : self_w ] ) for all temperatures .",
    "thus , we can associate this state with the high - temperature paramagnetic one ( p ) .",
    "if one assumes that bifurcations away from this solution occur in a continuous fashion , then we can apply the so - called guzai expansion @xcite , i.e. consider the perturbation @xmath69 , with @xmath70 due to normalization . a linear stability analysis",
    "then produces the following two conditions where , respectively , the first and second moments of @xmath55 $ ] bifurcate : @xmath71 where @xmath72 ( details on similar calculations can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "these two conditions provide the critical temperatures where a ferromagnetic ( f ) and a spin - glass phase ( sg ) appear , respectively .",
    "the range of integers over which we maximize ( [ eq : pf],[eq : psg ] ) expresses physically the fact that at the moment of bifurcation towards an ordered phase the distribution of spin orientations has @xmath73 maxima ( in fact possible bifurcating modes occur at the fourier modes @xmath74 ) . for @xmath75",
    "we find that the bifurcating mode is given by @xmath76 implying that spins can be ordered in a parallel or in an anti - parallel fashion ( they are energetically equivalent ) . for larger values of @xmath7",
    "we find a transition in which the bifurcation mode changes from @xmath76 to @xmath77 .",

    "[ fig : poisson_omega0 ] we plot phase diagrams for @xmath81 for different values of @xmath7 .",
    "the left picture corresponds to poisson degree distributions @xmath82 , while in the right picture we show the phase diagram for a regular graph .",
    "larger values of @xmath7 produce sharper p@xmath79f and p@xmath79sg transitions .",
    "the critical temperatures provided by simulation experiments and the numerical solution of our equations ( [ eq : m ] ) are in good agreement with the results of the bifurcation analysis supporting the fact that all transitions are second - order ( at least for @xmath83 where we have currently focused ) . for the f@xmath79sg transition we have assumed that it is given by the dotted line .",
    "this follows from physical reasoning ( absence of re - entrance phenomena @xcite ) .",
    "the change in the bifurcation mode is given by the open circles , namely for @xmath84 we find that @xmath76 solves the maximization problem in ( [ eq : pf],[eq : psg ] ) , whereas for @xmath85 we have @xmath77 .",
