    "we suggested that the presence of dusty circumstellar envelopes around asymptotic giant branch(agb ) stars should leave a signature , a clear excess at 10 @xmath1 m , in the mid infrared ( mir ) spectral region of passively evolving stellar systems bressan et al .",
    "early detections of such an excess were suspected in m32 ( impey et al . 1986 ) from ground - based observations , and in a few ellipticals observed with isocam ( bregman et al .",
    "1998 ) . the first unambiguous confirmation , though barely resolved , was found with the iso cvf spectrum of ngc 1399 ( bressan et al .",
    "since agb stars are luminous tracers of intermediate age and old stellar populations , an accurate analysis of this feature has been suggested as a complementary way to break the degeneracy between age and metallicity that affects optical observations of early type galaxies ( bressan et al .",
    "1998 , 2001 ) .",
    "in fact the models show that a degeneracy between metallicity and age persists even in the mir , since both age and metallicity affect mass - loss and evolutionary lifetimes on the agb .",
    "but while in the optical age and metallicity need to be anti - correlated to maintain a feature ( colour or narrow band index ) unchanged , in the mir it is the opposite : the larger dust - mass loss of a higher metallicity ssp must be balanced by its older age .",
    "thus a detailed comparison of the mir and optical spectra of passively evolving systems constitutes perhaps one of the cleanest ways to remove the degeneracy . besides this simple motivation and all other aspects connected with the detection of evolved mass - losing stars in passively evolving systems ( e.g. athey et al .",
    "2002 , temi et al .",
    "2005 ) , a deep look into the mid infrared region may reveal even tiny amounts of activity ( e.g. kaneda et al . 2005 ) . here",
    "we report on the first clear detection of extended silicate features in a sample of virgo cluster early type galaxies ( bressan et al 2006 ) , observed with spitzer irs instrument ( houck et al .",
    "2004 ) of the _ spitzer space telescope _",

    ".virgo galaxies observed with irs [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "standard staring mode short ( sl1 and sl2 ) and long ( ll2 ) low resolution irs spectral observations of 18 early type galaxies , were obtained in the first cycle between january and july 2005 .",
    "the galaxies were selected among those that define the colour magnitude relation of virgo cluster ( bower , lucy & ellis 1992 ) , whose common explanation is in term of a sequence of passively evolving coeval objects of decreasing metallicity .",
    "the log of the observations , number of ramps ( of 60s or 120s ) and s / n reached at 6 @xmath0 m are shown in table  1 .",
    "the spectra were extracted within a fixed aperture ( 3.6``@xmath218 '' for sl and 10.2``@xmath210.4 '' for ll ) and calibrated using our own software , tested versus the smart software package ( higdon et al .",
    "2004 ) . since the reduction procedure is described in detail in bressan et al .",
    "2006 , here we will only resume the main steps . for sl observations ,",
    "the sky background was removed by subtracting observations taken in different orders , but at the same node position .",
    "ll segments were sky - subtracted by differencing the two nod positions . since the adopted irs pipeline ( version s12 )",
    "is specifically designed for point source flux extraction , we have devised a new procedure to flux calibrate the spectra , that exploits the large degree of symmetry that characterizes the light distribution in early type galaxies .",
    "we first obtained the real dn / jy by applying the corrections for aperture losses ( alcf ) and slit losses ( slcf ) to the flux conversion tables provided by the spitzer science center ( e.g. kennicutt et al .",
    "2003 ) . after the alcf and slcf corrections were applied we obtained the flux _ received _ by the slit , within a given aperture in the following way .",
    "for each galaxy we assumed a wavelength dependent bidimensional intrinsic surface brightness profile and , by convolving it with the instrumental point spread function ( psf ) , we simulated the corresponding observed linear profile along the slits , taking into account the relative position angles of the slits and the galaxy .",
    "the adopted profile is a two dimensional modified king law ( elson at al .",
    "1987 ) , with axial ratios taken from the literature @xmath3^{\\gamma/2 } \\label{elson}\\ ] ] in equation [ elson ] , x and y are the coordinates along the major and minor axis of the galaxies and i@xmath4 , r@xmath5 and @xmath6 are free parameters that are functions of wavelength , and are obtained by fitting the observations with the simulated profile . in order to get an accurate determination of the parameters of the profiles",
    ", several wavelength bins have been folded together .",
    "this procedure has a twofold advantage because , it allows us both to reconstruct the intrinsic profile and the corresponding sed , and to recognise whether a particular feature is resolved or not .",
    "finally the spectrum , extracted in a fixed width around the maximum intensity , is corrected by the ratio between the intrinsic and observed profile . since for the ll segment",
    "the above procedure is quite unstable , we have preferred to fix one of the parameters of the profile ( usually r@xmath7 ) to the value derived in the nearby wavelength region of the sl segment .",
    "finally , the ll spectrum has been rescaled to match that of sl , to account for the different extraction area .",
    "_ silicate emission from evolved stars .",
    "_    in figure [ passive ] we have collected all the galaxies whose mir spectra are characterised by the presence of the broad silicate emission features at 10@xmath0 m .",
    "these thirteen galaxies constitute 76% of the sample .",
    "the analysis of the irs spectra indicates that the 10@xmath0 m feature has an extended spatial distribution , consistent with that obtained in the spectral range dominated by stellar photospheres ( below 8@xmath0 m ) .",
    "this is in agreement with isocam observations that indicated spatially resolved emission at 6.7 and 15 @xmath0 m ( athey et al .",
    "2002 , ferrari et al 2002 , xilouris et al .",
    "the irs spectra are very well fitted by a combination of an m giant model spectrum ( marcs , gustafsson et al .",
    "2002 ) and dust emission from circumstellar envelope models computed by bressan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for a silicate grain composition , as shown in figure [ passive ] .",
    "the percentage contribution of the dusty envelope to the total flux at 10@xmath0 m is roughly 50% .",
    "this fraction is consistent with a population of dust enshrouded evolved stars because in spite of their paucity , their 10@xmath0 m luminosity is about 100 times the average 10@xmath0 m luminosity of the horizontal branch and red giant branch stars , making their contribution to the integrated light comparable . _",
    "if , as we believe , the 10@xmath0 m feature is of stellar origin , it constitutes perhaps the most important mid infrared diagnostic tool for the study of the stellar populations in passively evolving systems of the local universe .",
    "_ we notice however that the fits obtained here are better than those obtained by making use of the full isochrones ( see bressan et al .",
    "in particular it is surprising that the observations suggest that the major contribution comes from envelopes in a quite narrow range of optical depth ( @xmath8 @xmath9 ) , at variance with isochrones that account for a distribution of envelopes of varying optical depth .",
    "this indicates that a revision ( and understanding ) of the isochrones in the advanced phases is necessary .",
    "_ active galaxies .",
    "_    the other four galaxies shown in figure [ active ] , display various signatures of activity in the mir spectra .",
    "they constitute the 24% of our sample .",
    "it is worth noticing that these galaxies had already been classified as active from optical studies ( agn -m87- , liner or transition liner - hii ) , while no signatures of activity had been detected in the former group .",
    "spectra of ngc 4636 and ngc 4486(m87 ) are dominated by emission lines ( [ arii]7@xmath0 m , [ neii]12.8@xmath0 m , [ neiii]15.5@xmath0 and [ siii]18.7@xmath0 m ) , while those of ngc 4550 and ngc 4435 by pah emission ( at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 , 11.9 , 12.7 and 16.4@xmath0 m ) .",
    "ngc 4435 shows also emission lines ( and h2 s(3 ) 9.66@xmath0 m , h2s(2 ) 12.3@xmath0 m and h2s(1)17.04@xmath0 m ) .",
    "the broad continuum features at 10@xmath0 m ( and perhaps at 18@xmath0 m ) in m87 are unresolved and their likely cause is silicate emission from the dusty torus ( siebenmorgen et al .",
    "2005 , hao et al .",
    "2005 ) . in ngc 4435",
    "the continuum below @xmath106@xmath0 m looks extended , while above this ( in particular pahs ) it looks unresolved .",
    "a preliminary interpretation shows that an unresolved starburst is dominating the emission above @xmath106@xmath0 m , while at lower wavelengths the old extended stellar component dominates the continuum ( panuzzo et al . in preparation ) .",
    "we have obtained spitzer mid infrared irs spectra of early type galaxies selected along the colour - magnitude relation of the virgo cluster .",
    "we present a new method to reconstruct the sed of these galaxies , that rests on a careful analysis of the spatial profile sampled by the slits . in most of the galaxies ( 76% )",
    "the emission looks spatially extended and presents an excess longward of 10@xmath0 m , which is likely due to silicate emission from mass losing evolved stars .",
    "however , the peculiar distribution of the optical depth of the circumstellar envelopes derived from the fits requires a better understanding of the corresponding evolutionary phases . in the remaining smaller fraction ( 24% )",
    "we detect signatures of activity at different levels . if we exclude m87 which is noticeably an active galaxy , only two out of 16 early type galaxies observed show pahs , which corresponds to a quite low fraction ( @xmath1012% ) of the observed sample .",
    "it is premature to conclude that this fraction is representative of the early type population in clusters of galaxies , in particular if we consider that our investigation is limited to the brightest cluster members . a detailed comparison of our results with those obtained for field galaxies will certainly cast light on the role of environment in the galaxy evolution process .",
