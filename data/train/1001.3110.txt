    "non - hermitian hamiltonians naturally appear when the energy spectrum of a quantum system can be formally represented by both quasi - discrete ( intrinsic ) and continuous parts , and one performs a projection of the total wave function onto the quasi - discrete part of the spectrum @xcite . in this case , the corresponding intrinsic energy levels acquire finite widths which are associated with transitions from the intrinsic states to the continuum . then , the dynamics of the intrinsic states can be described by the schrdinger equation with an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "we consider the current - biased qubit - continuum detector system based on a josephson junction , which can be described by the hamiltonian ( @xmath0 ) @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the energy of level @xmath3 .",

    "@xmath48 is more than @xmath49 times that from level @xmath50 .",
