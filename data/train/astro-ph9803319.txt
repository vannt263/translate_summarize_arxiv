    "there is presently a large effort underway to predict and detect the weak gravitational lensing caused by large scale structure ( lss ) or the `` cosmic shear '' ( see @xcite ) .",
    "such a measurement would constitute a direct probe of the mass density fluctuations on large scales irrespective of how light and baryons are distributed .",
    "this would make it possible to measure one of cosmology s least well understood processes , how light traces mass and whether this is a function of scale .",
    "gravitational lensing causes images to be both magnified and demagnified as well as stretched asymmetrically ( shear ) .",
    "most of the methods proposed for detecting lss lensing are based on measuring the shear in high redshift galaxy images .",
    "although the distortions in the ellipticities of individual galaxies are expected to be small they are distorted in coherent ways .",
    "indications of lensing are sought in the alignment of the galaxy images with the assumption that they are not intrinsically aligned .",
    "this technique has already been used with great success on galaxy cluster lensing and is presently being applied to random fields in an attempt to detect the lensing effects of large scale structure . in this paper a method of detecting lensing directly through its magnification rather than shear is proposed .    the study of high redshift supernovae ( sne ) is another area of cosmology and astrophysics that is seeing a lot of activity .",
    "type ia sne , the brightest type of supernova ( sn ) , are believed to be caused by the thermonuclear explosion of an accreting white dwarf .",
    "it has been found empirically that the peak magnitude of type ia s have a dispersion of only 0.2 - 0.3 mag in b band .",
    "it has further been found that the peak magnitude is related to the width of the sn s light - curve which can then be used to reduce the dispersion to about 0.17 mag if one color is used @xcite and 0.12 mag if multiple colors are used @xcite .",
    "in addition to the light - curve width , the sn s color and spectral features are related to the peak luminosity @xcite .",
    "it may be possible to reduce this dispersion in the future by incorporating additional observables into the correction procedure .",
    "the uniformity in type ia sne combined with their high luminosity makes them an excellent tool for doing cosmology . using them to measure the redshift - luminosity distance relation",
    "has recently resulted in tightened constraints on the cosmological parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are now systematic searches for ia sne at high redshift which can reliably discover on the order of ten sne in a night s observing and do spectroscopic followup ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition there are several ongoing searches for low redshift sne .",
    "to date there have been more then 100 type ia sne discovered with redshifts between @xmath2 and @xmath3 and many additional ones at lower redshift .    in this paper",
    "i concentrate on the lensing produced by dark matter composed of microscopic particles .",
    "matter in macroscopic compact objects can cause microlensing .",
    "however , the known populations of stars will not cause a significant number of microlensing events .",
    "the microlensing of sne has been discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a sn could also be lensed by one dominant galaxy cluster or individual galaxy .",
    "there is the possibility of getting multiple observable images and high magnifications ( strong lensing ) in this case .",
    "it has been suggested that observing sne behind galaxy clusters would be a way of lifting the mass sheet degeneracy that exists in shear measurements of the gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "the likelihood of a sn at @xmath4 being strongly lensed by a galaxy or cluster is small unless they are specifically sought out . in general",
    "a sn will be lensed by many galaxies and larger structures , each have a weak contribution to the total magnification .",
    "this will increase the dispersion of high redshift sne and decrease the precision of cosmological parameter determinations .",
    "this decrease in precision has been investigated by @xcite using analytic methods and by @xcite using n - body simulations .",
    "@xcite calculates the lensing of point sources using numerical simulations which assume that all matter is in unclustered galaxy halos .",
    "@xcite ( and @xcite ) does analytic calculations of this effect under the assumption that all matter is in compact objects and none of them are close enough to the line of sight to a sn to cause significant lensing . in this paper",
    "the problem will be turned around and we will ask how well the lensing itself can be determined from the sn data",
    ".    there are several important differences between the lensing of sne and the lensing of galaxies .",
    "for sne the signal to noise ratio in each measurement can in fact be greater .",
    "lensing is estimated to contribute about @xmath5 to @xmath6 to the observed root - mean - squared ellipticity of a @xmath4 galaxy .",
    "for sne the variance in the lensing contribution is comparable to the intrinsic variance in the peak magnitude at this redshift .",
    "in addition the unlensed ellipticity distribution of galaxies at high redshift is not known and can not be easily extrapolated from zero redshift galaxies . for this reason",
    "lensing must be inferred by correlations between galaxies , either between lensed galaxies or between lensed galaxies and foreground galaxies .",
    "the result is that the lensing of galaxies measures the shear averaged over a finite area on the sky .",
    "this average shear drops rapidly with increasing area and the signal to noise is reduced to something more like @xmath7 per galaxy on the @xmath8 scale .",
    "this is made up for by the large number of evaluable galaxies ( @xmath9 ) to the extent that fluctuations in the projected mass density at @xmath10  arcmin scales are expected to be detectable in the near future .",
    "in contrast , the dispersion in the absolute magnitude of type ia sne is presumably independent of redshift .",
    "the dispersion can then be measured in a low redshift population where lensing is not important .",
    "the lensing of galaxies does have the advantage of sources that are generally at higher redshifts where the lensing is stronger . on the other hand ,",
    "the redshift distribution of faint galaxies is not strongly constrained which adds systematic uncertainty .",
    "the redshifts of sne are individually measured .",
    "it is clear that the lensing of sne and the lensing of galaxies probe different scales of density fluctuations for several reasons . because the lensing of galaxies can only be detected through correlations in their shear , or positions and shear , lensing structures that are smaller than roughly the separation between galaxies are not detectable .",
    "since each sn is an independent measure of the lensing at a point , not an average over a region on the sky , they will be sensitive to smaller scale structures .",
    "also the lensing of sne is a direct measurement of the magnification which , in the weak lensing limit , is directly related to the mass density along the line of sight .",
    "the shear is dependent on the mass outside of the `` beam '' and thus a shear map is in a way a smoothed version of a surface density map . in the thin lens approximation",
    "the shear and the magnification are related to each other through a differential operator @xcite which makes the shear insensitive to a uniform offset in the surface density - the `` mass sheet degeneracy '' .",
    "although the lensing of galaxies has limitations on small scales it does have the potential of measuring lensing over a large range of scales , arcminutes to degrees . with the possible exception of sne viewed through galaxy clusters , it will be difficult to find enough sne that are close enough together to measure correlations in their lensing .    in the next section",
    "i describe first how the lensing of sne is related to the density fluctuations and then i describe how the lensing signal could be identified in the data . in section  [ models ] a specific model of structure formation",
    "is used to estimate the level of signal and to motivate some parameterizations .",
    "the last section contains conclusions and remarks about possible complications .",
    "in section  [ lsslens ] i show how the variance and skew of the magnification of sne are related to the power spectrum and bispectrum of density fluctuations in the universe . in this section",
    "only a few loose and justifiable restrictions on the form of the density fluctuations will be required . in section  [ stat ]",
    "some formal comments are made on extracting parameters from the data and on estimating the precision with which parameters can be measured .",
    "it is assumed throughout that the lensing is weak and that multiple images are not produced .",
    "less than one in @xmath11 sne at @xmath12 are expected to be strongly lensed so this assumption is well justified for the redshifts considered here .",
    "lensing can be viewed mathematically as a mapping from points on a source plane to points on a image plane .",
    "the jacobian matrix of this mapping can be written as the identity plus a perturbation , @xmath13 . in the weak lensing limit",
    "the magnification is given by @xmath14^{-1 } \\simeq 1- \\mbox{tr}{\\bf \\phi}(\\theta)\\ ] ] it is standard practice to define the convergence , @xmath15 .",
    "the change in the magnitude of a point source is then @xmath16 \\simeq 2.1715 \\kappa(\\theta).\\ ] ]    to calculate correlations in @xmath17 i will use a perturbation method based on the techniques developed in @xcite .",
    "the shear tensor is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the comoving radial distance and @xmath20 for the open , flat and closed global geometries respectively .",
    "the curvature scale is @xmath21 .",
    "subscripts with commas in front of them denote partial derivatives and @xmath22 is the potential .",
    "the convergence will on average be zero , but it will be different for each sn .",
    "we need the correlation in the convergence of two sources at points @xmath23 and @xmath24 on the sky and at coordinate distances @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 it is useful to work in fourier space at this point .",
    "if the potential is statistically homogeneous and isotropic the power spectrum of the potential is related to its fourier coefficients by @xmath28 .",
    "the power spectrum of the potential is then related to the power spectrum of the mass density contrast by poisson s equation , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the scale factor normalized to 1 at the present epoch .",
    "the expression ( [ kappa1 ] ) can be significantly simplified by using an approximation that is equivalent to limber s equation @xcite .",
    "this is a very good approximation for most realistic models of large scale structure . with this approximation equation ( [ kappa1 ] ) can be reduced to @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the zeroth order bessel function .",
    "the bessel function reduces the correlations between sne to insignificant levels unless the sne are very close together .",
    "the variance is found by taking @xmath33 , @xmath34 .    in a like manner the third moment of @xmath35",
    "can be expressed in terms of the bispectrum . in the case of a homogeneous and isotropic field",
    "the bispectrum can be defined by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the angle between the vectors @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "correlations between sources will be even smaller in this case so i consider only the one point correlation . with similar assumptions to those used in getting ( [ kappa2 ] ) ,",
    "the third moment is @xmath40 ^ 3 \\int^{r_s}_0   \\left ( \\frac{w(r , r_s)}{a(r)}\\right)^3 \\int_0^\\infty d k \\int_0^\\infty d k ' \\int_0^\\pi d \\theta ~   k k ' b(k , k',\\theta,\\tau ) .",
    "\\label{kappa3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the bispectrum on large scales ( small @xmath41 ) is expected to be small or zero .",
    "the third and higher moments of @xmath42 are dependent on significantly smaller scale structure than the second moment .",
    "note that no assumption of gaussianity or linear evolution of structure has been used in deriving ( [ kappa2 ] ) or ( [ kappa3 ] ) .",
    "the question addressed here is how to measure the parameters of a model using the sn data .",
    "conversely , we would also like to know the amount and quality of the data that will be necessary to measure parameters to a given accuracy . to do these things",
    "i use a likelihood analysis approach . as seen in the last section the distribution of @xmath42",
    "is not expected to be gaussian .",
    "nonlinear clustering causes the distribution to be skewed in favor of demagnification .",
    "this is simply because the mass is concentrated into small regions so a typical line of sight will tend to travel disproportionately through underdense regions .",
    "the distribution of corrected , intrinsic magnitudes may not be gaussian either . at present",
    "the low redshift sne show some evidence of skewness , but are roughly consistent with gaussian after corrections for extinction .",
    "extinction corrections are more difficult for high redshift sne so non - gaussianity may be introduced in this way as well . however , with the observational errors included one might expect the distribution of @xmath43 to be close to gaussian because it is the result of several independent random processes .",
    "for the remainder of this paper i will make the simplifying assumption that @xmath43 is gaussian distributed .",
    "the logarithm of the gaussian likelihood function is @xmath44 \\label{likelihood}\\\\ & = & -\\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_i \\left [ ( \\delta m_i)^2 \\left(4.715 \\langle\\kappa_i^2\\rangle + ( \\sigma_m^2)_i\\right)^{-1 } + \\ln\\left(4.715 \\langle\\kappa_i^2\\rangle + ( \\sigma_m^2)_i \\right ) \\right ] \\label{diagonal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 , the difference between the observed and expected magnitudes , and @xmath46 is the covariance matrix as predicted by the model .",
    "expression  ( [ diagonal ] ) is for the special case where there are no correlations between sne .",
    "the subscripts correspond to each of the sne observed .",
    "i will divide the covariance matrix into two parts , the first due to lensing and the second due to other sources of dispersion in sn peak luminosities - @xmath47 .",
    "the matrix @xmath48 has no nonzero diagonal elements and is included to account for correlations between the sn luminosities that might arise from the light - curve and/or color corrections or correlations that might arise between sne observed on the same night or with the same telescope for example .",
    "the diagonal elements of @xmath49 are the @xmath50 s .",
    "in turn we can divide @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the variance in the intrinsic peak magnitude which is the same for all sne and @xmath53 is the variance due to noise , light - curve fitting , etc .",
    "there is no sum over repeated indices .",
    "maximizing ( [ likelihood ] ) or ( [ diagonal ] ) with respect to all the model parameters will result in the set of parameters that best fits the data .",
    "constraints from other , independent determinations of parameters could be incorporated into the likelihood function with a prior distribution .",
    "now consider the problem of estimating the precision with which cosmological or model parameters will be determined .",
    "the precision can be estimated by the ensemble average of the fisher matrix which is made of the second derivatives of the likelihood function with respect to those parameters . if we consider two parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 , @xmath56 \\label{precision } \\\\ & = & \\sum_i \\left ( 4.715 \\langle\\kappa_i^2\\rangle + ( \\sigma_m^2)_i \\right)^{-2 } \\left\\ { \\overline{m_i},_\\alpha \\overline{m_i},_\\beta ( 4.715 \\langle\\kappa_i^2\\rangle + ( \\sigma_m^2)_i ) + \\frac{(4.715)^2}{2 } \\langle\\kappa_i^2\\rangle,_\\alpha \\langle\\kappa_i^2\\rangle,_\\beta \\right\\ } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last line is true when the sne are statistically independent .",
    "the first terms in these expressions are the usual term that comes from uncertainties in measuring the mean magnitude of the sne and the second term is the result of the dispersion of the magnitudes , due to lensing or other causes , being a function of the parameters being measured .",
    "to make some quantitative and qualitative estimates i use models whose mass density is dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "it is helpful to first consider what might be expected for the form of the lensing signal . in linear theory @xmath57",

    "this allows the integral in ( [ kappa2 ] ) to decouple so that factors dependent on the power spectrum can be separated from factors dependent on cosmological parameters .",
    "the same thing happens in the opposite extreme when structure is highly nonlinear and fully virialized . in this case structure is stable in real space and the power spectrum evolves like @xmath59 regardless of cosmological parameters .",
    "these two extreme cases can be explicitly calculated for the @xmath60 model where @xmath61 , @xmath62 ^ 2 & \\mbox{stable evolution } \\end{array } \\right . \\label{estimate}\\ ] ] where the power spectrum is evaluated at the present day .",
    "these two results bracket the real result for @xmath60 models - linear evolution bounds it an the top and stable evolution on the bottom .",

    "if @xmath64 is measured firm bounds on the integral of @xmath65 can be found within a model .",

    "@xmath67 is a somewhat steeper function of @xmath68 because of the decay of potential fluctuations .",
    "the stable clustering case is less strongly dependent on @xmath0 except for the @xmath69 factor in ( [ kappa2 ] ) which comes from poisson s equation .",
    "the geometric factors in @xmath70 models will tend to make @xmath71 steeper , all other things being equal .    to make things more quantitative i use the linear power spectrum of matter fluctuations given by @xcite : @xmath72^{-1/4 } & \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to convert this to a nonlinear power spectrum",
    "i use the technique of @xcite which is based on n - body simulations and thus does not take into account any hydrodynamics that could be important on small scales . in all calculations",
    "this power spectrum goes to @xmath74 at small scales so that the dimensionless power spectrum @xmath75 becomes scale independent .",
    "figure  [ power ] shows what range in @xmath41-space is responsible for lensing in these models .",
    "the power spectrum in this range is speculative because the @xcite formulae which are fits to n - body simulations become less certain at small scales .",

    "this fits all the @xmath82 , cluster - normalized cdm models reasonably well with @xmath83 for flat models and @xmath84 for @xmath85 models as is shown in figure  [ kappas ] .",
    "the constant @xmath86 depends on how the power spectrum is normalized .",
    "if it is normalized to cluster abundances using the formulae of @xcite with @xmath87 i get @xmath88 for @xmath85 models and @xmath89 for flat models . in general",
    "the convergence does not have a simple dependence on @xmath90 because both the power spectrum s normalization and shape are dependent on it .",
    "if the normalization is kept constant and @xmath0 is varied independently , @xmath86 is a steeper function of @xmath0 , but this normalization will always be inconsistent with other observations for some range of @xmath0 . to properly incorporate independent constraints on the normalization ( or any other parameter ) , a prior distribution should be incorporated in the likelihood function , ( [ likelihood ] ) .",
    "as is expected from the discussion above , @xmath91 falls somewhere between stable and linear evolution for all the models . here",
    "the lensing parameter @xmath86 is estimated using cdm models , but this is only for the purposes of prediction . with data",

    ". it will be difficult to find enough sne that are close enough together for this cross - correlation to be measured .",
    "the large angular sizes and high densities of galaxy clusters make them an exception to this role , but a random line of sight is not likely to pass through a cluster .",

    "ccd cameras with fields of view approaching a square degree and very small pixel sizes are being built now .",
    "they will be used for weak lensing measurements using galaxy shear .",
    "sne searches could be incorporated into these surveys with the benefits of improved cosmological parameter estimation and complimentary weak lensing measurements .",
    "combined with the limits on the cosmological parameters the lensing of sne can constrain the power spectrum of the true mass density , unbiased by the light distribution , on the scale of galaxy halos .",
    "at present the mass distribution on these scales is not well known with the exception of within galaxy clusters which are certainly atypical regions . in this paper",
    "it has been assumed that the the large majority of matter in the universe is in the form of wimps or some other small particle .",
    "if the dark matter is in compact objects like machos the distribution of magnifications will be different . in this way",
    "the lensing of sne also provides information on the composition of dark matter .",
    "in addition to the variance of the magnification distribution the skewness would provide an important constraint on the nature of structure in the nonlinear regime .",
    "a future paper will treat this subject in more detail and relate the magnification distribution to the nature of dark matter and the structure of galaxy halos .",
