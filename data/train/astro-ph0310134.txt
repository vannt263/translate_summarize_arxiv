    "there is now strong evidence from observations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite that the universe is dominated by a nearly homogeneous component  the dark energy  which is causing the cosmic expansion to accelerate @xcite , @xcite . at present",
    ", the distance ( magnitude)-redshift relation data is the main source of information about dark energy .",
    "the new improved data about dark energy will be obtained in the nearest future from snap experiment .",
    "the snap satellite will observe roughly 2000 supernovae ( sne ) a year for three years with very precise magnitude measurements out to a redshift of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the problem is to establish the energy and pressure as a function of time . in this paper",
    "we will focus on the new method for analyzing experimental data which can be useful in solving the problem .",
    "the formal solution of this problem is well known .",
    "first of all , one needs to obtain the distance - redshift function @xmath1 from experimental data .",
    "this function is usually referred to as a dimensionless coordinate distance function .",
    "this procedure was carried out in @xcite , @xcite for sne and in @xcite for radio galaxies ( rgs ) .",
    "then it is necessary to find the first two derivatives of this function : @xmath2 \\displaystyle r'_{exp}(z)\\equiv \\frac{dr_{exp}(z)}{dz},\\qquad r''_{exp}(z ) \\equiv",
    "\\frac{d^2r_{exp}(z)}{dz^2}. \\end{array } \\label{in}\\ ] ] now , dark energy ( vacuum ) equation of state can be expressed through experimental data : @xmath3 % \\displaystyle \\left [ \\frac{1}{\\left(r'_{exp}(z)\\right)^{2}}+(\\omega -1)(1+z)^2-\\omega_m(1+z)^3\\right]_{z=1/a-1 } , \\\\[7 mm ] \\displaystyle",

    "recent cmb measurements by wmap give @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the main problem in this approach is that it requires numerical differentiation of noisy experimental data @xmath7 . for any set of experimental data this procedure gives @xmath8 with many non - realistic fluctuations which have large amplitude in comparison with average values .",
    "for this reason it is necessary to use smoothing of initial experimental data .",
    "the simplest smoothing procedure is fitting .",
    "however , fitting precision is completely determined by precision of the fitting function .",
    "several studies have examined different fitting functions .",
    "for example , @xcite consider the polynomial fit of @xmath1 and @xcite the polynomial fit of @xmath9 .",
    "three parametric fitting function for apparent magnitude @xmath10 is suggested in @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite proposed specially constructed fitting function reflected some properties of @xmath1 .",
    "the model dependent approaches were considered in @xcite , @xcite . the model independent approach where @xmath1 was fitted locally with a polynomial fitting",
    "is considered in @xcite . in our opinion",
    ", the problem of constructing the fitting function has a unique solution . in what follows",
    "we suggest physically and mathematically motivated function allowing one to perform the model independent analysis of experimental data and to constrain the dark energy equation of state .",
    "we suggest the _ motivated fitting function _ ( mff ) which has the following features :    *",
    "mff can be derived from einstein equations _ i.e. _ mff is not a phenomenological function ; * mff is model independent ; * a regular mathematical procedure transforms mff into formally exact solution of einstein equations ; * for any cosmological solution @xmath11 with @xmath12 , mff approximates @xmath11 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 with any given precision .",
    "with this function , one can increase precision of the model independent approximations of @xmath7 and two of its derivatives @xmath8 systematically .",
    "as it is turned out , mff is completely determined by the following condition : the only function we need to approximate is scale factor @xmath15 .",
    "it is important that no any other approximation is required .",
    "let us write cosmological solution and time - redshift relation @xmath16 @xmath17 the integral ( [ in ] ) is approximated as : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an exact solution of ( [ a1 ] ) with @xmath20 when @xmath21 .",
    "the polynomial coefficients @xmath22 are considered as fitting parameters .",
    "it is obvious that when @xmath23 the polynomial coefficients can be expressed through derivatives of the cosmological solution @xmath24 at the moment of observation . in this limit ( [ a ] )  ( [ ina ] ) are formally exact equations .",
    "unfortunately , one can not reach this limit in analyzing current experimental data .",
    "for example , the first three coefficients approach the first three derivatives starting with @xmath25 .",
    "however , the different cosmological solutions are approximated with a good precision staring with @xmath26 .",
    "one of the great advantages of mff approach is that the integral can be expressed through elementary functions after some redefinition of the fitting parameter set @xmath22 : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "( the redefinition procedure will be described later . )",
    "the only non - trivial point is that the fitting procedure must include exact solution of equation ( [ a1 ] ) .",
    "however , one can use the fact that the function @xmath33 has the argument @xmath34 .",
    "so , there exists an iteration procedure for this function which is always reduced with any given precision .    in spite of the fact that the result of integration ( [ ina ] ) becomes cumbersome with @xmath23 , there are no fundamental difficulties in working with mff in case of arbitrary @xmath35 . besides , explicit calculation of ( [ ina ] ) is not necessary .",
    "the fitting computer program ( which is included into origin 7 @xcite ) allows us to perform numerical calculation of ( [ ina ] ) during fitting procedure .",
    "this approach becomes efficient starting with @xmath36 .    to perform these calculations we need to restrict polynomial order @xmath35 to a minimal one",
    "this restriction is fixed by the following two conditions .",
    "the first condition is that the polynomial should reproduce @xmath37 and its two derivatives @xmath38 with respect to @xmath39 .",
    "the second is that the fitting curve should be stable against increasing the polynomial order",
    ". the second condition can be satisfied during fitting procedure . to meet the first condition one needs to study the mathematical features of the approximation .",
    "we can find the vacuum equation of state from einstein equations @xmath40",
    "\\displaystyle \\tilde p_{vac}(x)=-\\frac13\\left(2\\frac{\\ddot{a}}{a}+\\frac{\\dot{a}^2}{a^2}+\\frac{\\omega-1}{a^2}\\right ) \\label{eqvac } \\end{array}\\ ] ] only if we have a good approximation for the first and second derivatives of @xmath37 .",
    "the parametric representation of the equation of state @xmath41 is derived by substituting @xmath42 into ( [ eqvac ] ) .",
    "we studied polynomial approximations of cosmological solutions for quintessence models @xmath43 with @xmath44 . during numerical experiments",
    "it has been shown that _",
    "mff approximates any cosmological solution with relative error @xmath46 for @xmath12 .",
    "_ if we take @xmath26 ( with 3 fitting parameters ) , we have @xmath47 .",
    "high precision and universality of the polynomial approximation of the scale factor and its derivatives means that this approximation does not represent any model .",
    "so , _ approximated polynomial with the coefficients obtained by experimental data fitting can be considered as a model independent cosmological solution_.    let us write approximated function @xmath1 for @xmath26 explicitly .",

    "as we assume , mff can be useful in analyzing snap data .",
    "however , in this work we consider current data to illustrate suggested mff method .",
    "namely , we consider 78 sne data set ( table 3 from @xcite ) and 20 rgs data set ( joint fit in table 1 from@xcite ) for @xmath53 .",
    "some of the sne were observed more than once by independent observations ( the corresponding events will have greater weights ) . in this work",
    "we do not average out this events , so we consider the array of 112 points .    the fitting result is shown in figure [ snapfig1 ] .",
    "we used instrumental weighting and levenberg - marquardt method @xcite .",
    "the obtained parameters are @xmath54 \\displaystyle c=-0.47905^{+0.94034}_{-0.87797}\\;\\qquad \\chi_0 ^ 2/\\rm{dof}=1.07499^{+0.02390}_{+0.03147}\\ ; . \\end{array } \\label{fit1}\\ ] ] upper and lower values in ( [ fit1 ] ) correspond to parameters for upper and lower curves which bound cl68% region .",
    "this data set has been fitted by mff with @xmath55 and @xmath45 .",
    "it is turned out that fitting curves are almost coincide in the region where @xmath56 . in the region @xmath57 mff with @xmath55 does not work satisfactorily ( for example the corresponding @xmath58 is greater than those in ( [ fit1 ] ) . ) on the contrary in the region @xmath59 mff with @xmath45 is very sensitive to single experimental points and has non - realistic wave - like behaviour .",
    "for this reason mff with @xmath26 ( 3-parametric function ) is optimal for the analysis of the experimental data .",
    "note , that for the snap data , optimal @xmath35 will be greater ( most likely @xmath45 ) .",
    "one can see from ( [ fit1 ] ) that we have a set of fitting curves with almost the same @xmath58 .",
    "every fitting curve corresponds to a cosmological solution and we need to find the true solution .",
    "to do this we attempted to average experimental data .",
    "we considered two types of averaging . in the first type we calculated average values summing data on the different small @xmath60 regions . in the second type we divided @xmath61 axis into three or four regions , fitted data",
    "independently on each region and then combined resulting curves using mff .",
    "these methods gave almost the same result : averaged curves lie inside cl68% not far from initial fitting curve .",
    "after the long numerical experimentations we concluded that initial fitting curve is a better candidate for reflecting the true cosmological solution .",
    "from the fact that geometrical set of averaged data points lie not far from initial fitting curve it follows that mff with @xmath62 can reconstruct structural features of the true solution at the different redshift regions .",
    "this allows us to obtain the first derivatives @xmath63 directly from analytical expression for mff .",
    "for this reason @xmath64 can be regarded as the mean values and @xmath65 as the systematic errors .",
    "so , each experimental point can be parameterized by the statistical confidence parameter @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the statistical error ( denoted in @xcite as @xmath68 ) .",
    "we suggest to use this parameter for estimating various physical quantities @xmath69 calculated using fitting curve . here",
    "we can introduce conventional errors @xmath70 .",
    "let us turn to vacuum equation of state and consider the function @xmath71 \\displaystyle \\tilde p_{eff}(a)\\equiv \\tilde p_{vac}(a)+\\frac{\\omega-1}{3a^2}=-\\frac{1}{(r'_{fit})^2}-\\frac{2r''_{fit}}{3a(r'_{fit})^3 } , \\end{array } \\label{epeff}\\ ] ] which is derived using data fit ( see figure [ snapfig2 ] ) . when @xmath72 it is necessary to use both functions in ( [ epeff ] ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that _",
    "functions plotted in figure [ snapfig2 ] were obtained in a model independent way_.    since @xmath73 changes slowly it is reasonable to suppose that flat universe model with a cosmological constant could be a possible cosmological model .",
    "more detailed information can be obtained through fitting @xmath74 with the following model @xmath75 \\displaystyle \\tilde p_{eff}(a)=\\frac{(n-3)\\omega_{de}}{3a^n } + \\frac{\\omega-1}{3a^2 } \\end{array } \\label{mod}\\ ] ] which has three fitting parameters @xmath76 . as a result",
