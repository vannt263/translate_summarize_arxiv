    "we have performed our calculations in the dirac - coulomb ( dc ) approximation which embodies the dominant relativistic and correlation effects .",
    "the breit interaction which is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the coulomb interaction has therefore been omitted in the present case as the systems are comparatively smaller in size . + the dirac - coulomb atomic hamiltonian is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the usual dirac matrices and @xmath39 is the potential at the site of the @xmath40 electron due to the atomic nucleus .",
