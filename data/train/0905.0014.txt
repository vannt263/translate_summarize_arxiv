    "recent discovery of the iron - based superconductors  @xcite has generated considerable interest in the condensed community .",
    "@xcite it is the only class of non - cuprate materials with high superconducting transition temperature .",
    "the iron - based superconductors bears both similarity to and important differences from cuprate superconductors . on the one hand ,",
    "both families of superconductors have a layered structure and exhibit magnetism in undoped phase . on the other hand , although the undoped cuprate superconductors are antiferromagnetic mott insulators , almost all iron - based parent compounds are still metals , which have an sdw instability with a small magnetic moment .",
    "@xcite in addition , band structure calculations  @xcite based on the local density approximation to density functional theory have emphasized the multi - orbital nature in the new superconductors , in contrast to the cuprates , where only the @xmath0-orbital is most important .",
    "now it seems commonly accepted from these calculations that the fermi surface consists mainly of two electron sheets and two hole sheets in most of the parent compounds .    to uncover the mechanism of superconductivity in these materials ,",
    "the determination of pairing symmetry of the superconducting order parameter is a good starting point . up to now , many types of pairing symmetry have been suggested , ranging from the @xmath2-wave symmetry ,  @xcite mixed @xmath3-wave symmetry ,  @xcite and extend @xmath4-wave symmetry ,  @xcite besides the @xmath5-wave symmetry .",
    "@xcite experimentally , the pairing symmetry can be either revealed by such phase - sensitive methods as multi - crystal junctions ,  @xcite or inferred by non - phase - sensitive techniques like angled - resolved photoemission spectroscopy  @xcite and tunneling ,  @xcite and other more traditional thermodynamical measurements .",
    "the first type of technique has not been applied successfully to the iron pnictides yet .",
    "the latter type of techniques are making strides by providing detailed information about the nature of single - particle excitations . at this moment",
    ", the consensus of the pairing symmetry in the new class of superconductors remains unsettled in view of the fact that conflicting data have been reported .",
    "for example , results from some tunneling ,  @xcite photoemission ,  @xcite and nuclear - spin - lattice relaxation  @xcite measurements indicate a @xmath3-wave pairing symmetry while those from other tunneling ,  @xcite photoemission ,  @xcite specific heat ,  @xcite and penetration depth  @xcite measurements show the evidence for an @xmath4-wave pairing symmetry .    to identify the pairing symmetry being conventional or unconventional , the electronic structure around local inhomogeneity such as single impurities / defects , surfaces / interfaces , and magnetic vortices can provide useful information ,  @xcite which can be measured by such local probes as stm and nuclear magnetic resonance .",
    "recently , the local electronic states near impurities  @xcite and surfaces / interfaces  @xcite have been studied in the context of @xmath6-wave  @xcite or @xmath1-wave  @xcite pairing symmetry in a two - band model for the iron - based superconductors , where the existence of impurity resonance or surface andreev bound states is discussed . in a single - band model as relevant to high-@xmath7 cuprates , earlier studies  @xcite have revealed the difference of local electronic states in the mixed state between @xmath4-wave and @xmath3-wave pairing symmetry .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to report a comparison study of local electronic structure in the mixed state for both the @xmath0-wave and @xmath1-wave pairing symmetry within a minimal two - band model of superconductivity .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] , we introduce the multi - band model for the iron - pnictide superconductor and derive a set of multi - band bdg equations . in sec .  [",
    "sec : results ] , we present numerical results first for the uniform case to identify the favorable pairing symmetry for a given channel of pairing interaction , and then for the mixed state to investigate the local electronic structure for both @xmath0-wave and @xmath1-wave pairing symmetry .",
    "the effect of the emergent antiferromagnetic sdw order on the resonance core states is also discussed .",
    "finally , a summary is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "we start with a multi - band model for the normal state band structure and introduce the phenomenological pairing interactions within each band .",
    "the fermi surface topology as mapped out by the magneto - oscillation measurements consists of weakly corrugated small - size cylinders .",
    "therefore , we consider only a two - dimensional ( 2d ) system for simplification .",
    "the magnetic field applied along the direction perpendicular to the 2d plane creates quantized vortices in the mixed state .",
    "the model hamiltonian can be written as : @xmath8\\;.   \\label{eq : hamil}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the operators @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) annihilate ( create ) an electron at the @xmath11-th site in the orbital @xmath12 and of the spin projection @xmath13 . in the presence of the magnetic field , when the electron hops from the @xmath14-site to the @xmath11-site , a peierls phase factor is acquired such that @xmath15 $ ] , where @xmath16 is the zero - field hopping integral and we assume it to be real , @xmath17 is the vector potential , and the quantity @xmath18 is the superconducting magnetic flux quantum . in the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamil ] ) , the quantity @xmath19 is the chemical potential , and @xmath20 is the superconducting pair potential , which is given by @xmath21 . in our model , only the spin singlet and intra - orbital pairing is considered .",

    "we solve the above set of bdg equations self - consistently : first guess an initial pair potential @xmath30 and exactly diagonalize the equation ; use the obtained eigenfunctions and eigenvalues to update the pair potential ; repeat the procedure until the desired convergence criterion is satisfied .",

    "it is applicable to any version of the multi - band tight - binding model as recently proposed for the low - energy @xmath3-electron physics for the iron - based superconductors .",
    "@xcite several groups  @xcite have pointed out that one may need at least three orbitals to accurately reproduce the lda band structure and fermi surface topology .",
    "however , it has also been argued recently  @xcite that the fe 3@xmath33 and 3@xmath34orbitals play an important role in the low energy physics of these materials . for simplicity",
    ", we consider in the present paper a minimal two - band model as suggested in ref .  , with the following tight - binding hopping integrals @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",

    ", we notice that the superconductivity is in close proximity to the magnetism in iron pnictides .",
    "in particular , the temperature - doping electronic phase diagram shows that the antiferromagnetic sdw state is either coexistent with ,  @xcite or incipiently interrupted by ,  @xcite or disappears immediately before  @xcite the superconducting state . in the following ,",
    "we introduce an heisenberg - like exchange interaction term between the electronic spin density to take into account the magnetism .",

    "we take the exchange coupling along the @xmath71- and @xmath72-direction to have opposite signs , which is consistent with the recent band structure calculations on laofeas .",
    "@xcite we assume @xmath83 with @xmath84 to be positive .",
    "although this assumption is oversimplified , it should still serve well to demonstrate the effect of magnetic ordering . by including this term in the bdg equations , we repeat the numerical calculations for varying values of @xmath75 ( @xmath85 ) . in fig .",

    "the sdw order parameter has maximum at the vortex core center and then decreases away from the core center , which means the sdw order is induced by the magnetic field and is nucleated at the vortex core center . in this case , the value of the superconducting order parameter far away from the core center is almost unchanged as compared to the case in the absence of the magnetism .",
    "when the exchange coupling is increased , the sdw order becomes more spread while the superconducting order parameter becomes more suppressed accompanied by an expansion of the vortex core in size .",
    "we note that for larger values of @xmath75 , the sdw can coexist with the superconducting order even in the absence of the magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field further suppresses the superconducting order parameter in the formation of magnetic vortices . in fig .",

    "we find that as the sdw order begins to nucleate at the vortex core , the resonance peak near the fermi energy in the ldos is split into a double - peak structure , and the overall intensity of the structure is decreased ( see the curve for @xmath86 ) . with the increasing exchange coupling strength , the sdw order is further enhanced , and the peak is further split with decreased intensity ( see the curve for @xmath87 ) . as the exchange coupling strength is sufficiently large , the resonance peak can be almost completely suppressed ( see the curves for @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) .",
    "these results provide one possible account for the absence of resonance peak at the vortex core center as revealed by the stm on the iron - pnictide superconductor bafe@xmath76co@xmath77as@xmath78 .",
    "in summary , we have adopted a minimal two - band tight - binding model with various channels of pairing interaction , and derived a set of two - band bdg equations .",
    "the bdg equations have been implemented in real space and then solved self - consistently via exact diagonalization . in the uniform case , it has been found that the @xmath0-wave pairing state is most favorable for a nearest - neighbor pairing interaction while the @xmath1-wave pairing state is most favorable for a next - nearest - neighbor pairing interaction .",
    "we have also studied the local electronic structure around a magnetic vortex core for both @xmath0-wave and @xmath1-wave pairing symmetry in the mixed state .",
    "it has been shown from the ldos spectra and its spatial variation that the resonance core states near the fermi energy for the @xmath0-wave pairing symmetry are localized while those for the @xmath1-wave pairing symmetry can evolve from the localized states into extended ones with varying electron filling factor .",
    "furthermore , by including an effective exchange interaction , we have shown that the emergent antiferromagnetic sdw order can suppress the resonance core states .",
    "the emergence of the antiferromagnetic sdw states , regardless of being field induced or pre - existent provides one possible avenue to understand the absence of resonance peak as revealed by recent stm experiment .",
