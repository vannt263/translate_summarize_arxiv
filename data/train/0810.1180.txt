    "several members of this class have been discovered since the launch in 2002 of the satellite , thanks to its monitoring of the galactic plane performed with a large field of view and a good sensitivity at hard x - rays .",

    "the x  ray spectra of sfxts are very similar to those typically displayed by accreting x  ray pulsars , with a flat power law spectrum below 10 kev and a high energy cut - off around 1030  kev ( see @xcite , for the first truly simultaneous wide - band x  ray spectrum of a sfxt , from 0.3 to 100 kev ) .",
    "this spectral similarity suggests that the other members of the new class of hmxbs probably host a neutron star , as well .",
    "the emerging picture of the sfxts as a class , especially thanks to more sensitive monitoring performed with  of four sfxts [ see @xcite for the strategy of this on - going campaign ] , is that they sporadically undergo bright flares , up to peak luminosities of 10@xmath610@xmath7  erg  s@xmath2 , with a duration of a few hours for each single flare .",
    "this bright flaring activity is actually part of a much longer duration outburst event , lasting days [ see @xcite and @xcite ] .",

    "we note that the 2006 flare spectrum was extracted about 2000  s after the bat trigger ;  made a delayed slew to the source , too late to catch the peak of the first flare which triggered the bat .",
    "this implies that the low column density observed during the 2006 flare is probably so low when compared with the first 2008 flare ( wt1 , taken only 137  s after the bat trigger ) , only because of the ionization effect caused by the flare that triggered the bat ( and not observed by xrt ) .",
    "this suggests that , during extended bright flaring activity , it is not possible to directly derive the mass of the clump which is supposed to produce the enhanced accretion luminosity , in the framework of the clumpy stellar wind model @xcite , because part or all of the accreting material could have been ionized by a previous bright flare ( as in 2006 , where the presence of a precursor flare is deduced from the fact it triggered the bat ) .    the broad - band spectrum during the 2006 flare is well fitted with a power law with a high energy cutoff at @xmath87kev .",
    "this is compatible with a surface magnetic field of a typical x  ray pulsar @xcite , around 10@xmath88  g , much lower than that suggested by @xcite , or by @xcite .",
    "the inter - flare emission is highly variable , showing a trend with an average decreasing flux after the first flare ( for about 10  ks ) , then continuously increasing by an order of magnitude ( with a low intensity flaring activity , see pc2 part ) up to the second flare . the spectrum in this lower intensity inter - flare emission",
    "is well fitted with a hard power law with a photon index of @xmath41 , which implies that accretion is still present .",
    "the true quiescence has been observed by @xcite , and displays a much softer spectrum and a lower luminosity around @xmath410@xmath10  erg  s@xmath2 .",
    "this inter - flare emission is probably due to the accretion of inter - clump medium , implying a density ( and/or a velocity ) contrast in the supergiant wind of at least 10@xmath89 , which is not unusual in line - driven winds .",
    "indeed , in recent years evidence has been accumulated that hot stellar winds are not smooth , as previously thought , but highly inhomogeneous [ see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ] , thus implying important consequences , for example , in the mass loss rate determination , and also in the stellar evolution .",
    "this new  data set interestingly allows to accurately determine the flare duration , particularly of the second ( pc3 data ) and third flares ( wt4/pc5 ) . fitting their light curves with gaussian profiles , we derive a fwhm of 370@xmath90  s and 500@xmath91  s , respectively .",
    "these durations can be used to derive information about the distance of the neutron star from the supergiant companion during the outburst , since the clump sizes increase with the distance from the supergiant star , as follows .",
    "the size of a clump is determined by the balance pressure equation .",

    "2@xmath12510@xmath126  cm ; thus , flare durations of the order of @xmath4500  s can be produced at a radial distance of @xmath4@xmath127 ( or 10@xmath12  cm ) , which implies an orbital period of @xmath435  days , assuming a companion mass of 30  m@xmath128 .",
    "this estimate is in agreement with that obtained by @xcite , but is significantly shorter than what calculated by @xcite .",
    "we note that the first three outbursts reported in literature ( on 52821 mjd , 53870 mjd and 54012 mjd ) are indeed spaced by a multiple of 35 days ( 30 and 34 cycles , respectively , after the first observed outburst on 52821 mjd ) . on the other hand , the 2008 outburst ( 54652 mjd ) does not occur strictly after an integer number of cycles with this assumed period .",
    "this suggested to try different combinations of two numbers ( two sub - periods p@xmath129 and p@xmath130 , such that p = p@xmath129+p@xmath130=35 days ) , to test the possibility , suggested in @xcite , that the sfxts outbursts occur with a double periodicity , when the neutron star crosses the equatorial wind of the companion twice along the eccentric orbit ( see their fig .",

    "the multiple flares we observe here , reaching similar peak luminosities , cover about one day of bright outburst emission and are then followed by lower x  ray emission in the subsequent days , similar to what we already observed in four other sfxts with  ( see fig .",
    "[ igr08408:fig : comp ] ) .",
    "the three flares observed here so close in time , after a long period during which no bright flares have been observed , are suggestive of the fact that the neutron star is probably crossing a region of higher average density of the wind , compatible with the model we proposed for igr  j11215@xmath55952 @xcite . in this hypothesis",
    ", the outbursts in sfxts are produced when the neutron star crosses an equatorially enhanced region of the supergiant companion , which is inclined with respect to the orbital plane .",
    "the different flares then are probably produced by inhomogeneities in the structure of the wind , which , in our proposed model , is anisotropic , showing a preferential plane along the equator of the supergiant companion .",
