    "we are able to condense more than 120@xmath010@xmath1 sodium atoms , which is , as far as we know , the largest condensate made with a cooling strategy based on laser cooling . in the hydrogen bec experiment @xcite a cryogenic trap is used as a starting point for the evaporative cooling .",

    "a high number of atoms in the bec is essential , because the coupling of atoms to the superradiant scattered states scales exponentially with the number of atoms in the condensate . in this case",
    "a high atom number will give a strong increase in the signal to noise ratio and allows for the excitation of higher order modes .",

    "for the realization of a large atom number bec it is important to minimize the atomic losses during the cooling process .",
    "one of the important loss processes is the inelastic collisions with background gas atoms .",
    "this is especially important during the evaporation , which takes a relative long time ( 50 s ) . for a lifetime of the cloud , which is in the order of the evaporation time",
    ", the background pressure must in general be below 10@xmath10 mbar . in our setup",
    "the background pressure is below 10@xmath11 mbar , which is abundantly enough , as will be shown in sec .",
    "[ secmt ] .",
    "this ultra - high vacuum is reached by carefully minimizing the beam load from the atomic source to the background pressure and maximizing the pumping speed , as described in the following .    our setup ( fig .",
    "[ vacuum ] ) consists of three main parts : the oven , the zeeman slower and the trapping chamber .",
    "the first part is a recycling sodium oven , in which 50 g of solid sodium is heated up to 570 k. the first chamber of the oven consists of nw-35 conflat parts .",
    "the sodium vapor leaves this chamber through a 6 mm diameter diaphragm .",
    "the sodium beam enters the recycling chamber , which consists of a conical adapter to nw-63 . in this chamber ,",
    "atoms outside the well - collimated beam are removed from the beam by an extra 8 mm diaphragm .",
    "to the recycling chamber , a 6 mm internal diameter tube is welded , which is connected to the bottom of the first chamber , allowing the sodium to flow back to the first chamber .",
    "the relative large internal diameter of the first part of this recirculating oven is required to limit the pressure inside this chamber , which attenuates the primary beam .",
    "the second diaphragm is heated up to 383 k due through heat conduction from other parts of the oven , which keeps the sodium in the fluid phase .",
    "we choose not to apply any gold - coated stainless steel mesh either in this chamber or in the recirculating tube , because wetting can be problematic for sodium . at the running temperatures the 50 g sodium lasts for 5000 hours without recirculation .",
    "this is as long as we are using it until now , so no conclusion about the recirculation can be drawn at present .",
    "the oven is pumped with a 1200 l / s diffusion pump to a pressure of 4@xmath010@xmath12 mbar .",
    "the second part of the setup is the zeeman slower , which is used to slow down the thermal atomic beam @xcite .",
    "this device will be discussed in more detail in sec .",
    "[ seczeeman ] . regarding the vacuum system the zeeman slower consists of a 1900 mm long tube with a diameter of 50 mm yielding a conductivity of 8 l / s .",
    "one turbo pump is mounted between the oven and the beginning of the zeeman slower and another pump is mounted in the zeeman slower 1300 mm from the beginning .",
    "this configuration leads to pressure of 1@xmath010@xmath13 mbar at the point of the second turbo pump . between the zeeman slower and the bec chamber a tube with a length of 120 mm and a diameter of 17 mm",
    "is mounted as a differential pumping section yielding a conductivity of 5 l / s .",
    "the bec chamber is equipped with 9 windows for optical access .",
    "all windows are mounted with aluminum helicoflex rings on both sides of the window to provide a leak - tight glass - to - metal sealing .",
    "the leak rate of each window is measured to be 7@xmath010@xmath11 mbar l / s . the total inflow in the bec chamber including the beam load out of the zeeman slower is 6@xmath010@xmath13 mbar l / s . the bec chamber is pumped by an ion getter and titanium sublimation pump , mounted at a cf-160 port with a specified pumping speed of 1000 l / s . from the pump towards the trapping region the chamber has a conical shape to minimize the pumping resistance ( fig .",
    "[ vacuum2 ] ) . with this shape",
    "the actual pumping speed is likely to be close to the specified pumping speed .",
    "therefore , the inflow of 6@xmath010@xmath13 mbar l / s is compensated at a pressure of about 6@xmath010@xmath14 mbar , which is below the limit of our pressure gauge of 1@xmath010@xmath11 mbar .",
    "the downside of this configuration is that the thickness of the window and the conical shape force us to put the coils further from the atoms leading to a reduced field gradient .",
    "the first step in the cooling process towards bec is taken by laser cooling and trapping @xcite .",
    "for this we need laser light with the proper wavelength to drive a closed transition . for sodium",
    "the transition at a wavelength of 589 nm from the 3@xmath15s@xmath16 to the 3@xmath15p@xmath17 is closed ( fig .",
    "[ levelscheme ] ) . for laser cooling the hyperfine transition from the @xmath18 ground state to @xmath19 excited",

    "due to off - resonant scattering to the @xmath20 excited state followed by decay to the @xmath21 ground state ( separated by 1772 mhz ) about 2 % of the atoms will be lost from this transition .",
    "after 350 absorption - emission cycles , which is only a small fraction of the cycles needed to slow down a thermal beam , less than 0.1 % of the atoms are still in the @xmath18 ground state .",
    "this problem is circumvented by re - exciting the atoms from the @xmath21 ground state with the so - called repump laser .",
    "ground state to @xmath19 excited state is used .",
    "if an atom decays to the @xmath21 ground state , due to off resonant scattering to the @xmath20 excited state , it will be pumped back by the repumper.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in our experiment we use for each frequency ( cooling and repumping ) a separated laser ( fig . [ lasersetup ] ) .",
    "the advantage of this system compared to setups , where only one laser is used , is that we do not need optical power consuming elements to shift the frequency by 1772 mhz .",
    "both laser frequencies are produced by spectra - physics 380d dye - lasers .",
    "the dye - laser that produces light at the laser cooling frequency is pumped with a 5 w solid state cw laser ( millennia , spectra - physics ) and generates 700 mw light .",
    "the other dye - laser , which is used for the repumping is pumped with a 5 w argon - ion laser ( serie 2060 , spectra - physics ) and generates 500 mw light .",
    "the cooling laser is locked to the cooling transition frequency by frequency modulated saturation spectroscopy @xcite . for this",
    "a small percentage of the light is split off and used for the spectroscopy .",
    "the light is divided in two beams . from one beam",
    "the intensity is measured on a photo diode after passing a quartz sodium cell .",
    "the other beam is double passed through an acousto - optical modulator ( aom ) .",
    "the frequency of this aom is modulated with 6 khz and an amplitude of 2 mhz around a center frequency of 76 mhz . the + 1 order of the frequency modulated beam passes the quartz sodium cell in opposite direction while overlapping the first laser beam .",
    "the signal from the photo diode is passed through an lock - in amplifier , where the first derivative of the signal is generated .",
    "this makes it possible to lock the laser at a zero - crossing of the signal , which corresponds to the maximum of the absorption in the sodium cell .",
    "the + 1 order of the aom is locked to the @xmath18 to @xmath19 transition .",
    "thus the lock point of the laser is shifted by -76.0 mhz with respect to the @xmath18 to @xmath19 transition .    for locking the repump laser a doppler - free bichromatic lock ( dfbl )",
    "is used @xcite .",
    "this lock has the advantage that no lock - in amplifier and frequency modulation is needed .",
    "the dfbl - lock is based on the saturation spectroscopy , in which the laser frequency is locked on the slope of a resonance peak .",
    "locking on a slope makes the frequency sensitive for fluctuations in the laser power . in the dfbl - lock two orders of an aom",
    "are passed through a sodium cell generating two lamb profiles .",
    "these lamb profiles are electronically subtracted resulting in a doppler free signal with a possibility to lock on a zero - crossing .",
    "the lock point can be tuned by changing the aom frequency or by using a different combination of orders of the aom .",
    "we use the @xmath22 and @xmath23 order of a 70 mhz aom .",
    "this results in a laser frequency of -77.5 mhz with respect to the @xmath21 to @xmath24 transition @xcite .",
    "the lock point of the cooling laser is in principle independent of the parameters of the laser , which makes it the frequency reference of our experiment .",
    "although the lock of the repump laser is not sensitive for fluctuations in the total laser power , it does depend on the balance between the two orders of the aom .",
    "this makes the lock sensitive for pointing instabilities of the laser .",
    "we monitor this shift in the repump frequency measuring the beat signal of the two lasers .",
    "shifts in the beat frequency are manually corrected by adjusting the balance between the two orders of the aom used for the dfbl - lock .",
    "the beat also allows us to deduce the exact frequency of the repump laser .",
    "the fluctuation of the beat frequency is less than 2 mhz , from which we conclude that the frequency fluctuations of each laser remains within 1 mhz , assuming both lasers have the same stability .     and @xmath25 direction ( splitting into two separated beams is done after passing the fiber ) , one for the mot beams in the @xmath26 direction , and one for the probe beam , used for the illumination of the atomic sample .",
    "the other dye - laser ( upper one ) generates light at the repump frequency .",
    "this light is also divided into four beams : one for repump light of the mot , one for spin polarizing the sample , one for the probe beam , used for the illumination of the atomic sample , and a probe beam for the atomic beam .",

    "after passing the aom s the light is transported through single mode polarizing preserving optical fibers ( fibercore , hb600 ) to the setup .",
    "the fiber has a diameter of 125 @xmath4 m and a numerical aperture of 0.15 .",

    "our recycling oven produces a sodium flux of 3@xmath010@xmath27 atoms / s at a temperature of 570 k. this flux is determined by measuring the absorption from a beam probe at the end of the zeeman slower .",
    "if we assume that the velocity distribution of the atoms out of the oven obeys the maxwell - boltzmann distribution at a temperature of 570 k , only 0.02 % of the atoms have a velocity smaller than 30 m / s , which is the capture velocity of our trap .",
    "the loading of the trap can be increased significantly by predecelerating the beam in a zeeman slower . in a zeeman slower",
    "the atoms are decelerated by a counter propagating laser beam , while the changing doppler shift is compensated by a changing zeeman shift due to an inhomogeneous magnetic field along the deceleration path . in",
    "the zeeman slower the longitudinal velocity decreases , but there is no cooling in the radial direction . the loss of atoms due to this increasing divergence can be compensated by placing the end of the zeeman slower as close to the trapping chamber as possible . in this situation",
    "it is complicated to install a vacuum pump between the zeeman slower and the trapping chamber .",
    "therefore , our zeeman slower is divided in two parts , where in between the two parts a pump is placed .",
    "the pumping section is passed by the atoms with a velocity of 200 m / s , so that the beam divergence is still small at this point .",
    "other ways of minimizing the losses due to the divergence is by using 2d optical molasses @xcite , a magneto - optical lens @xcite or a magneto - optical compressor @xcite at the end of the zeeman slower .",
    "all of these options have proved to be efficient ; however , they need extra laser beams , which makes them in day - to - day operation less favorable compared to our solution .        in fig .",
    "[ slower ] the calculated magnetic field in the zeeman slower as a function of the distance from the beginning of the zeeman slower is given ( solid line ) .",
    "the field starts at 1000 g for a capture velocity of 950 m / s . in the zeeman",
    "slower the atoms pass a region with a zero magnetic field . in this region",
    "the energy splitting of the magnetic sublevels is not large enough to prevent off - resonant scattering to the @xmath20 excited state followed by decay to the @xmath21 ground state .",
    "therefore , a repumper is needed to prevent losses from the cooling process during the passage of the pumping section .",
    "this repump frequency is generated by passing the laser beam through an electro - optical modulator ( eom ) operating at 1720 mhz .",
    "the side band generated with the eom contain 10 % of the total intensity .",
    "the eom is placed after the optical fiber because the eom crystal disturbs the beam profile to much to get sufficient transmission through the fiber ( @xmath2845% ) .",
    "figure [ slower ] also shows the calculated velocity of the atoms passing the zeeman slower ( dotted line ) .",
    "we can see that the final velocity ( 30 m / s ) is not reached until close to the trapping region , which is a great benefit for the number of particles in the slowed beam .",
    "the slow atom flux is measured with the beam probe to be 7@xmath010@xmath9 atoms / s .",
    "taken the divergence of the atomic beam due to the slowing into account the slowing efficiency is determined to be around 10 % .",
    "we have not yet fully tracked down the reason for this sub - optimal performance .",
    "with atoms slowed down to 30 m / s , a dark - spot mot is loaded for 6 s. in the dark - spot mot configuration the repump beam has a black spot in the center of the beam .",
    "the spot is imaged at the mot , where it has a diameter of 12 mm .",
    "the atoms in the center of the dark - spot mot are optically pumped to the @xmath21 ground state due to the presence of only cooling light @xcite .",
    "this prevents the density limitation due to intra - mot collisions in a bright mot @xcite .",
    "the light of the dark - spot mot consists of three retro - reflected laser beams ( mot beams ) with beam diameter of 25 mm and a detuning of -11 mhz with respect to the @xmath18 to @xmath19 transition , and one beam ( repump beam ) with a detuning of + 2.5 mhz with respect to the @xmath21 to @xmath24 transition ( see tab . [ laser ] ) .",
    "the quadrupole magnetic field needed for the mot is generated by two anti - helmholtz coils producing a field gradient of 5 g / cm at a current of 15 a. a typical dark - spot mot in our experiments consists of 2.0@xmath0@xmath2 atoms with a temperature of @xmath3 @xmath4k at a peak density of about 1.0@xmath010@xmath5 atoms/@xmath6@xcite .",
    "note , that due to the slow atom flux of 7@xmath010@xmath9 atoms / s the mot loads in a few seconds .",
    "after loading the dark - spot mot the atoms are transferred to the mt for the evaporative cooling .",
    "the efficiency of this transfer depends on the distribution of the atoms over the magnetic sublevels of the trapped state .",
    "the sodium atoms trapped in a dark - spot mot occupy the @xmath29 ground state . the homogeneous distribution over the three magnetic sublevels , makes that only 1/3 of the atoms are in the `` low field seeking '' state ( @xmath30 ) , which can be trapped in the minimum of the magnetic trap . the @xmath31 state , which can also be trapped in the minimum of the magnetic trap with two times stronger confinement is not investigated .",
    "it is harder to reach bec with atoms in this state , since only a pure @xmath31 state is stable against spin changing collisions .",
    "therefore , all the atoms in other @xmath18 ground states must be removed from the trap before evaporation @xcite .    the transfer efficiency from the mot to the mt of 1/3 can be increased by spin polarizing the sample before loading it into the mt .",
    "this can be done by applying a short laser pulse with the proper polarization in combination with a small magnetic field to define the spin state with respect to the magnetic trap ( fig .",
    "[ spinpolprincipe ] ) .",
    "spin polarization is a commonly used technique in bec experiments , for example in the experiments with rb @xcite , he @xcite , and ne @xcite . in these experiments",
    "transfer efficiencies up to 0.70 are reached . to our knowledge in sodium bec experiments",
    "the efficiency has never exceeded 0.35 @xcite due to the large number of transitions lying very close to each other in frequency in combination with the high optical density .",
    "the final degree of polarization is determined by the balance between the optical pumping to the polarized state and the depolarization .",
    "the depolarization is caused by off - resonant scattering of the spin - polarization beam by atoms , which are already polarized , and the reabsoption of spontaneous emitted photons . in sodium mots used in bec experiments the optical density is so high , that these are strong depolarization mechanisms .",
    "for sodium it is not possible to circumvent this problem using a larger detuning due to the large number of optical transitions , which are close to each other in frequency .",

    "the depump transition are not shown.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in our experiment we spin polarize the atoms in a high magnetic field .",
    "the high magnetic field induces large level splittings , which makes it easier to drive only the transition needed for the polarization process .",
    "furthermore , due to the large level splittings the optical density of the sample decreases significant , which makes the re - absorption of spontaneous emitted photons no longer problematic @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field is created by a combination of the fields generated by the pinch and bias coils of the magnetic trap .",
    "the details of this trap will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ secmt ] . with these coils",
    "we can tune the field from 0 to 125 g with a accuracy of 1 g. directly after the mot magnetic field and the repump laser beam are turned off the magnetic field of the spin polarizing is turned on .",
    "note , that the mot laser beams are still on .",
    "it takes about 500 @xmath4s for the field to stabilize . after this time",
    "the spin polarizing beam is turned on for 500 @xmath4s . during spin polarizing",

    "for trapping the atoms during the evaporative cooling we use a magnetic trap in the cloverleaf configuration @xcite .",
    "the trap is schematically shown in fig .",
    "the two pinch coils generate a curvature in the magnetic field in the @xmath26-direction , which causes confinement along this direction .",

    "the advantage of the cloverleaf trap is the full 360@xmath33 optical access .",
    "we operate the gradient and the pinch / bias coils at 300 a and 200 a , respectively .",
    "the current of 300 a through the gradient coils yields a magnetic field gradient of @xmath34 g / cm in the radial direction .",
    "the curvature field in the axial direction is @xmath35 g / cm@xmath15 at a current of 200 a through the pinch / bias combination .",
    "the minimum of the field is 3.4 g. this leads to trap frequencies in the axial and radial direction of @xmath37 hz and @xmath38 hz . the stability of the minimum of the magnetic field is essential for a reproducible evaporation .",
    "the minimum is generated by subtracting the two relative large magnetic fields of the pinch and the bias coils , which makes it very sensitive for the current through this coils as well as the position of the coils .",
    "to minimize the first effect the current through the pinch and bias coils is produced by the same power supply . in parallel with the bias coils a shunt is placed , to fine tune the current through the bias coils .",
    "the second effect is minimized by gluing all the windings of the separated coils together with loctite , subsequently both sets of coils are fixed in polyester boxes .",
    "the coils are made of hollow , rectangular copper wires , through which cooling water is pumped .",
    "the temperature of the cooling water is stabilized within 1 @xmath39c . with these precautions",
    "the stability of the field minimum of our trap is 0.4 mg .",
    "this is determined by measuring the stability in the number of particles in the bec , when the atoms are cooled very close to the bottom of the trap .",
    "the stability of the trap is 500 hz , which corresponds to 0.4 mg .",
    "the switch - on time of the coils is less than 2 ms .",
    "most information from the cold atoms is obtained from time of flight images of the expanding cloud .",
    "therefore , the expansion of the cloud should be dominated by the dynamics of the cloud and not by the remaining magnetic field .",
    "this makes it important that the magnetic field is switched off fast on the time scale of the trap period ( less than 1 ms ) . to meet these requirements all the sets of coils",
    "are equipped with a fast switch .",
    "our switch consist of a resistor and a diode , which are placed in parallel with the coils , and an insulated gate bipolar transistor ( igbt , dynex dim600bss17-e000 ) in serial to the coils . to switch off the magnetic field",
    "the igbt is opened .",
    "this is done relatively slowly ( 50 @xmath4s ) on the time scale of the igbt to limit the peak voltage arising during the turn - off to 1200 v. this limitation does not increase the switch - off time , because this is determined by the self induction of the coils .",
    "the energy that is released from the coils is absorbed in the resistor .",
    "because a diode is placed in serial with the resistor , no current flows through the resistor during normal operation of the magnetic trap . to suppress the limitations in the switch - off time due to eddy currents the amount of metal between the coils",
    "is minimized .",
    "this is achieved by mounting large windows ( radius of 63.5 mm ) in the vacuum chamber in the @xmath26-direction ( fig .",
    "[ vacuum2 ] ) .",
    "the radius of the windows is twice as big as the outer radius of the pinch coil .",
    "the switch - off time of the coils is less than 300 @xmath4s ( 1/e time ) . in the experiment",
    "we have increased the time to 750 @xmath4s , because a switch - off time of 300 @xmath4s generates repulsive forces between the coils large enough to crack the polyester box in which they are mounted .",
    "after spin polarizing , as described in the previous section , the gradient coils are turned on and the shunt is closed , which changes the high bias field used for the spin polarizing into a curvature field .",
    "the strength of the trapping potential of the mot and the mt must be matched , so that heating during the transfer is avoided .",
    "when the mt is much stronger than the mot , this can be done by turning the mt on slowly . however , in our experiment we can turn on the magnetic trap immediately at the full strength without problems of mode matching the distributions of the atoms in the mot with the distribution of the atoms in the mt . in the mt we can load 1.4@xmath010@xmath40 atoms at a temperature of 350 @xmath4k with a peak density of 5.0@xmath010@xmath40 atoms/@xmath6 .    in fig .",
    "[ lifetime ] the amount of atoms in the mt is plotted as a function of the storage time in the mt . from the fit of the data to an exponential decay the lifetime of the atoms in the mt is determined to be 260 s. this is long enough for the evaporative cooling , which takes only 50 s. therefore , we loose only @xmath41 20% of the particles due to the finite pressure .",
    "the atoms in the magnetic trap are cooled to degeneracy by evaporative cooling .",
    "the basic principle of this technique is that the atoms with an energy higher than the average kinetic energy are removed from the sample by spin - flipping them to an untrapped state , followed by rethermalization of the remaining atoms due to elastic collisions @xcite .",

    "the number of condensed atoms can be determined in two ways : either by the total absorption or by the width of the thomas - fermi profile @xcite . in the first case",
    "the number of condensed atoms becomes @xmath64 , where the center density is given by @xmath65 , with @xmath61 the radius of the bec after expansion and @xmath66 the absorption cross section . for the @xmath21 ground state to the @xmath24 excited state transition the absorption cross section is given by @xmath66 = @xmath67 and the square of the clebsch - gordan coefficient becomes @xmath68 .",
    "the second method of extracting the number of atoms from the images is to determine the chemical potential from the width of the profile .",

    "after expansions shorter than 30 ms the high optical density makes the first method less reliable . in our experiment",
    "we use the chemical potential for determining the number of particles ( second method ) , because this is insensitive for fluctuations in the probe frequency , while optical density is .    with the decompression , as described in the previous section",

    "evidence for the phase transition from a thermal gas to a bec is the changing aspect ratio as a function of the time of flight ( fig .",
    "[ tof ] ) . after a short time",
    "the cloud of atoms still has the shape of the atom distribution in the magnetic trap , which is elongated in the vertical direction in the pictures .",

    "this effect can been seen clearly in our measurements .",
    "to summarize , we have realized a bec of sodium containing 120@xmath010@xmath1 atoms .",
    "this is as far as we know the largest condensate starting from an optical trap .",
    "the large number of particles is mainly due to two reasons compared to similar experiments .",
    "first , we start with a large number of atoms in the mt due to spin polarizing the sample before we load the atoms in the mt . secondly , we loose less than a factor of 120 in the number atoms during the evaporation .",
    "this relatively small loss is caused by suppression of the 1,2,3-body losses during the evaporation .",
    "the 1-body losses are strongly reduced due to the low background pressure , resulting in a lifetime of the atoms in the mt of more than a factor 5 longer than the evaporation time .",
    "furthermore , the 2-body losses and especially the 3-body losses are suppressed by lowering the density of the cloud due to the decompression during the evaporation .",
    "the large number of atoms provides us the possibility to do experiments such as superradiant scattering with a better signal to noise ratio .",
    "furthermore , the large number of atoms in combination with the low trap frequencies gives rise to a high volume condensate .",
