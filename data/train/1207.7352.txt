    "cta 1 ( g119.5 + 10.2 ) is a composite supernova remnant ( snr ) with centrally bright x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "this snr has a radio shell with a radius of @xmath2 , and its kinematic distance estimated from the associated h@xmath3 emission is @xmath4  kpc @xcite . the x - rays from cta 1 comprise both thermal and non - thermal emission @xcite . while the outer regions mainly consist of shock - heated thermal emission , the non - thermal component dominates the central emission , which has led to the speculation of a hidden pulsar in this snr @xcite .",
    "in addition to the radio and x - ray observations , the launch of _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ ( cgro ) provided a further insight on the nature of cta  1 .",
    "_ energetic gamma ray experiment telescope _ ( egret )",
    "onboard cgro has revealed a @xmath5-ray source , 2eg j0008 + 7307 @xcite , in the 2nd egret catalogue ( or 3eg j0010 + 7309 in the 3th egret catalogue ; @xcite ) , which was suggested to be associated with cta 1 in view of the positional coincidence @xcite .",
    "the lack of variability of this extended @xmath5-ray source as well as its spectral resemblance to a typical @xmath5-ray pulsar further suggested that a neutron star should reside in this snr .",
    "nevertheless , the limited photon statistics obtained by egret did not allow any meaningful pulsation search in the mev@xmath6gev regime .",
    "observations with _",
    "rosat _ have revealed an x - ray point source , rx  j0007.0 + 7302 , at the center of cta  1 @xcite .",
    "it was also identified as the x - ray counterpart of 2eg  j0008 + 7307 / 3eg j0010 + 7309 @xcite .",
    "this point source was identified as a neutron star candidate with the high @xmath5-ray - to - x - ray and x - ray - to - optical flux ratios as well as its x - ray spectral behaviours @xcite , which were found to be similar to those of the only one radio - quiet @xmath5-ray pulsar known at that time  geminga @xcite . utilizing the high resolution imaging capability of _ chandra _ ,",
    "@xcite have uncovered a torus@xmath7jet feature , which resembles the morphology of a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) as seen in other bright @xmath5-ray pulsars .",
    "furthermore , the sub - arcsecond angular resolution of the _ chandra _ image provided a precise position , which can facilitate multi - wavelength investigations . to identify the neutron star nature unambiguously ,",
    "several studies attempted to search for the spin period of rx  j0007.0 + 7302 @xcite in different energy bands .",
    "nevertheless , no conclusive evidence for pulsations in radio / x - ray was yielded in these previous studies .    with the unprecedented sensitivity of the _ large area telescope _ ( lat ) onboard _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ , a @xmath5-ray pulsar , lat psr j0007 + 7303 , was eventually detected in cta  1 @xcite .",
    "this source has a spin - period of @xmath8  ms and was the first radio - quiet @xmath5-ray pulsar detected by lat .",
    "its spin parameters imply a characteristic age of @xmath9  yr , which is consistent with the kinematic age of cta  1 ( @xmath10  yr ; @xcite ) .",
    "this strongly suggests an intrinsic association between the pulsar and snr . with the discoveries of more radio - quiet @xmath5-ray pulsars @xcite",
    ", we can now examine them as a unique class .",
    "it has been speculated that the main distinction between radio - quiet and radio - loud @xmath5-ray pulsars is simply a geometrical effect . in order to further investigate their emitting properties ,",
    "x - ray observations are deeply required .",
    "although the periodic signals of these @xmath5-ray pulsars can be significantly detected , geminga is the only one radio - quiet @xmath5-ray pulsar with a detected x - ray pulsation before 2009 @xcite . in order to investigate the possible origin of the pulsed x - rays from the radio - quiet @xmath5-ray pulsars as a whole class ,",
    "searches for the possible pulsations from these pulsars have been conveyed with dedicated x - ray observations , including psr j0007 + 7303 . with a @xmath11  ks observation with _ xmm - newton _ ( hereafter _ xmm _ ) , the x - ray pulsation of psr j0007 + 7303 have been independently detected by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "apart from the x - ray pulsation , this deep _ xmm _ observation also reveals the nebular emission extending for @xmath12 in south - east direction away from the pulsar ( see fig .  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "together with the torus and jet feature found by @xcite , all previous x - ray investigations suggest lat psr j0007 + 7303 has a complex pwn structure .",
    "to continue the investigation , we have observed this interesting object with _ suzaku _ , which enables a detailed analysis in both soft and hard x - ray bands .",
    "in this paper , we report the results obtained from analysing the _ suzaku _ data .",
    "@xcite was built with two main payloads , five nested conical thin - foil grazing incidence telescopes ( xrt ; @xcite ) with the effective energy range of 0.2 - 12 kev and a hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; @xcite ) with the effective energy range of 10 - 600 kev .",
    "there are two major detectors for spectroscopy ( x - ray spectrometer and x - ray imaging spectrometer ) in _ suzaku _ and each of them is set at the focus of an xrt .",
    "our observational results on the temporal and spectral analyses mainly come from the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; @xcite ) and the hxd .",
    "the xis consists of three front - illuminated ( fi : xis0 , xis2 , xis3 ) and one back - illuminated ( bi : xis1 ) ccd detectors , but only the fi chips provide the observations in timing / p - sum mode . because the time resolution of hxd is 61  @xmath13s and that of xis in the timing mode is @xmath14  ms , our data is precise enough for the periodicity search to a radio - quiet @xmath5-ray pulsar with the spin period in tens or hundreds of milliseconds",
    "however , two of the xis units with fi chips , xis0 and xis2 suffered a catastrophic damage on 2006 november and 2009 june respectively .",
    "since no useful data can be obtained with xis2 and a part of the segment in xis0 is lost , only the observation of xis3 unit can be used for temporal analysis .",
    "these events seriously decrease the probability to obtain the periodic signals from the faint sources in the soft x - ray band .",
    "there are also two independent detector systems used for the observations of hxd .",
    "the positive - intrinsic - negative ( pin ) silicon diodes are sensitive below @xmath15  kev in the fov of @xmath16 , and the gadolinium silicate / bismuth germanate crystals ( gso / bgo ) phoswich counters can detect photons above @xmath17  kev in the fov of @xmath18 . because the data obtained from hxd have no imaging capability , we only did the analysis of the hxd - pin data to avoid the contamination caused by the large background size of the hxd - gso , which is much larger than the size of cta  1 .",
    "our observation for cta 1 was carried out on 2010 january 8 with total exposures of @xmath19  ks in the soft x - ray band and @xmath20  ks in the hard x - ray band , and it was aimed at the hxd nominal position to rx j0007.0 + 7302 with ( j2000 ) r.a.=@xmath21 , decl.=@xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the xis0 and xis1 data of _ suzaku _ were observed in the normal mode without window option , while the _ suzaku_/xis3 data observed within 128 rows were compressed into one dimension to attain a higher time resolution .",

    ". however , the xis0 and xis1 data are still adequate for the spectral analyses of the x - ray point source and the pwn to compare with the results yielded by other x - ray missions .",
    "the adoption for the center of the point source is referred to the aim point of the _ suzaku _ observation . because rx j0007.0 + 7302 is seriously contaminated by the surrounding pwn , we extracted the spectra of rx  j0007.0 + 7302 only within 1@xmath27.5 central circular region instead of the regular choice of 3@xmath27 circular region for a point source .",
    "this adoption still contains @xmath28 of the encircled energy fraction ( eef ) .",
    "we extracted the background of the pulsar from a concentric annulus of radii 100@xmath29 centered at the aim point of this _ suzaku _ observation .",
    "the spectra extracted from the point source comprise 695 counts for xis0 and 401 counts for xis1 after subtracting the background .",
    "we also considered the point source selection in two other different sizes with 2@xmath27 and 3@xmath27 in radii using the same center as shown in table  [ xissp ] .",
    "such selections of the point source contain @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the eef , respectively .",
    "the background of these selected regions were determined within a concentric annulus of radii 2@xmath32 , and 3@xmath33 .",
    "different choices for a point source region are used to verify that the significant excess contributed by the surrounding pwn can be detected with the increasing size .    for the pwn",
    ", we firstly examined its source extent by applying adaptive smoothing to both xis0 and xis1 images .",
    "the images shown in fig .",
    "[ pwn_img ] were generated with taking into account the vignetting of the xrt .",
    "we used the task `` xissim '' to simulate a flat field image for our purpose , and we displayed the obtained image after dividing by the flat field .",
    "a large structure with an extent of @xmath0 appears to extend eastward from the pulsar . in view of the possible spectral steepening due to synchrotron cooling",
    ", we performed a spatially - resolved spectral analysis of the pwn .",
    "the extraction regions are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ pwn_reg ] .",
    "we split the pwn into three regions , namely the inner part ( a circular region within a radius of @xmath34 ) , the middle part ( an annulus with radii 2@xmath35 ) and the outer part ( a panda region with radii 4@xmath36 ) . the background spectra are sampled from the source free low - count regions from each detector respectively .",
    "we only consider the spectra obtained with the @xmath23 mode to perform the spectral analysis of the pwn because of its better photon statistics . to yield better photon statistics to describe the spectral behaviour for the pwn",
    ", we have rebinned all the spectra before the analysis .",
    "we generated the spectrum with @xmath37 cts / bin for the inner part , and with @xmath38 cts / bin for the middle and outer parts .",
    "we generated the associated response matrix ( rmf ) and auxiliary response ( arf ) files by the heasoft command of ` xisrmfgen ' and ` xissimarfgen ' .",
    "the spectrum obtained from each detector was rebinned with a minimum of 30 counts per channel to ensure @xmath39 statistics .",
    "we then introduced a constant in a simultaneous fit to account for the cross - calibration mismatch between different detectors .",
    "we also considered different circular sizes to describe the contribution of the point source .",
    "details about the spectral results are presented in @xmath40 3 .",
    "the xis3 data was investigated by the timing / p - sum mode with a long duration of @xmath41  ks and its image was compressed into one dimension without the information along y - axis to obtain higher time resolution .",
    "our procedures to resolve the point source in a one - dimensional image follow the standard recipe for reducing xis data with the timing mode @xcite",
    ". we also redid the event reprocessing to consider the grade filtering and generated the new cleaned event file using the script ` xisrepro.xco ' with the proper selection criteria . for the p - sum mode",
    ", we need to remove the hot pixels on the image manually . to identify those hot pixels , we accumulated all the photon events along the coordinate of actx .",
    "we first removed those columns that have photons significantly more than others , and then we counted the distribution of events in the remaining columns and removed those pixels with the photons exceeding 3@xmath42 than the median of the distribution . after excluding all the hot pixels , the source is still too marginal to be resolved in the histogram of actx versus photon events of the xis3 data .",
    "we then tried to rebin the distribution of counts along actx with several pixels as shown in fig .",
    "[ xis3 ] . a point - like source with 112 pixels ( @xmath43 )",
    "can be roughly detected close to the center when we rebinned with 32 pixels .",
    "there are 58255 photons for this source within 0.2 - 12 kev and the significance of this detection is @xmath44 .",
    "we also checked the absolute arrival time of the photon events and determined the time required for readout by the actx position of the source in the xis1 image . in order to perform a precise temporal analysis",
    ", we corrected the arrival time with the decrease of 31.2 ms for all the source photons .",
    "the solar system barycentric time correction was then implemented with the task ` aebarycen ' at ( j2000 ) r.a.=@xmath45 , decl.=@xmath46 @xcite to yield a time list , which can be used to examine the pulsation of rx  j0007.0 + 7302/psr  j0007 + 7303 in the soft x - ray band .",
    "the hxd observation was conducted in nominal pointing . since the hxd is a non - imaging instrument , we can not separate the contribution of the pulsar from the surrounding nebula .",
    "however , a spectrum can be acquired to describe the behaviour of the total hard x - rays emitted from the entire cta 1 .",
    "we only focus on the hxd - pin detections of the hard x - rays emitted from / around cta  1 . in order to examine the periodic signal of the pulsar",
    ", we also applied the solar system barycentric time correction with the task ` aebarycen ' at ( j2000 ) r.a.=@xmath45 , decl.=@xmath46 @xcite on the hxd - pin observation .",
    "the events in the observation were restricted according to the effective energy range ( 10 - 60 kev ) of the pin detector , and 26661 photons were obtained for temporal analysis after the screening of the energy .    we also subtracted the non - x - ray background ( nxb ) and cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) to obtain the hxd - pin spectrum .",
    "the simulated nxb was directly obtained from the _ suzaku _ data center , and the cxb flux that is @xmath47 of the nxb for pin could be derived from @xcite .",
    "@xmath48 these background spectra correspond to epoch `` 6 '' for the flat pin response matrix .",
    "we also evaluated the contribution of the galactic ridge x - ray emission ( grxe ) using the _ suzaku _ observation of a nearby blank sky ( obsid=504039010 ) at ( l , b)=(123@xmath49.9 , 10@xmath49.0 ) , which is 4.3 degree apart from the cta  1 .",
    "following the same method as stated in @xcite we assumed a power - law spectrum with a fixed photon index at 2.1 @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the grxe within @xmath50 kev was evaluated to be @xmath51 photons sec@xmath52 , which only corresponds to @xmath530.2% of the nxb .",
    "thus , the contribution of grxe is negligible when we analyse the hxd - pin spectrum of cta  1 . after the background subtraction",
    ", we rebinned the spectrum to ensure that the photon numbers in each channel are larger than 30 .",
    "the expected spin frequency of the pulsar in our _ suzaku _ data can be inferred from the contemporaneous _ fermi _ ephemeris @xcite .",

    "we search for periodic signals with the known first frequency derivative around the predicted frequency in _ suzaku_/xis3 and hxd - pin data using @xmath56-test @xcite .",
    "the @xmath56-value is only 11.7 corresponding to the expected spin frequency of 3.165750271(6 )  s@xmath52 for the _ suzaku_/xis3 observation and only 6.7 for the _ suzaku_/hxd - pin observation .",

    "however , the counts gathered in the source region are much more than we expected based on the spectral behaviour provided by @xcite .",
    "we noted that most of the additional counts obtained from the p - sum mode data are caused by the instrumental background .",
    "for the data detected in the hard x - ray band , the main contribution of the hard x - ray photons is ascribed to the x - ray background . if we assume the pulsed spectrum of @xcite , the expected s / n ratio of the _ suzaku _ investigation is too low ( @xmath58 ) to yield the periodic signal from the pulsar .",
    "we also examined this spin frequency using @xmath59-month _ fermi _ archive ( 2009 november 22 - 2010 february 21 ) on the epochs close to our _ suzaku _ observation .",

    "we derived the soft x - ray spectrum from xis0 and xis1 onboard _",
    "suzaku_. based on our selected region for the x - ray point source , the ratio of net source counts for the pulsar to the total photons in the source region considered in the spectrum of xis0 is more than 25% but in that of xis1 is only @xmath62% .",
    "this is caused by the fact that the bi chip ( xis1 ) has a higher effective area at low energies .",
    "we only considered the spectral fits in the range 0.5 - 10 kev and ignored those photons outside this energy range to avoid large uncertainties .",
    "a cross - calibration term was included to correct the difference among the xis spectra , and the result is consistent with the fit to the spectrum of any individual detector .",

    "if the initial spin angular momentum of rx  j0007.0 + 7302 is dominated by the kick process , the jet emitted along the rotational axis should be more or less perpendicular to the direction of proper motion , which can explain the relative orientation between jet and the @xmath0 feature . therefore",
    ", measuring the proper motion of rx  j0007.0 + 7302 with multi - epoch x - ray imaging ( e.g. @xcite ) and/or dedicated @xmath90ray pulsar timing solution yielded from lat data can help to constrain the relation among various extended feature of this complex system .    despite the exact origin of this large extended feature remains to be uncertain , the x - ray spectral analysis confirms its non - thermal nature .",
    "assuming it is a synchrotron nebula , we discuss its emission properties in further details . for the synchrotron emitting electrons distributed as @xmath91 where @xmath5 is the lorentz factor of the wind particles , the resultant x - ray photon index @xmath65 depends on whether the emission is in a fast or slow cooling regime @xcite .",
    "this is determined by cooling frequency of the emitting region @xmath92 , where @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the electron mass , thomson cross section , synchrotron lifetime and the magnetic field strength respectively .",
    "we have @xmath97 for a fast cooling scenario ( i.e. @xmath98 ) and @xmath99 for slow cooling ( i.e. @xmath100 ) . for a standard shock model",
    ", @xmath101 spans a range of @xmath102 ( cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath65 should span the ranges of @xmath103 and @xmath104 for the scenario of fast cooling and slow cooling , respectively . comparing these ranges with the values inferred in the xis spectrum ( cf tab .",
    "[ pwn_spec ] ) , we suggest that the inner and the middle parts of this pwn are probably in a slow cooling regime . for the outskirt of the nebula , the best - fit photon index suggests the synchrotron cooling in this region is also slow .",
    "however , within the @xmath105 confidence interval of the inferred photon index , it is on the margin of both regimes .",
    "cm@xmath55 following table  [ pwn_spec ] .",
    "the spectral behaviour of the pulsar is determined by the power - law fit of table 1 from @xcite . the spectrum and the data points for the pwn",
    "are derived from the outer region ( the data include @xmath57 5% contribution of the pulsar ; see table  [ pwn_spec ] ) . the solid , dotted , and dashed lines represent the uncertainty ranges of the spectral behaviour of the psr , pwn , and hxd.,width=302 ]    for the inner and middle regions of the pwn , we speculate that @xmath106 should lie beyond the energy range covered by xis . assuming @xmath107  kev and the synchrotron lifetime of the emitting electrons is comparable with the characteristic age of the pulsar ( i.e. @xmath108  yrs ) , the magnetic field strength in the emitting region",
    "can be estimated at the order of @xmath109  @xmath110 , which is comparable with the typical field strength in the ism ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "apart from the observation in the soft x - ray band , we have also investigated the field of cta  1 with the hard x - ray data collected by hxd - pin .",
    "the spectrum obtained in this hard band ( i.e. @xmath80  kev ) can be described by a power - law with @xmath83 . the unabsorbed flux in @xmath111  kev is found to be @xmath112  erg  cm@xmath55  s@xmath52 .",
    "we note that the photon index inferred in this band can not be tightly constrained ; however , within the @xmath105 confidence interval , the hxd spectrum can be smoothly connected with the spectrum inferred from the soft band although might have slightly spectral steepening as shown in fig .",
    "[ spec ] .",
    "we should point out that the true nature of the hard x - ray emission is not yet conclusive .",
    "the fov of the hxd is @xmath113 , while the size of pwn in the soft x - ray is only @xmath114 . in view of the lack of imaging capability of hxd - pin",
    ", the observed hard x - rays can possibly be contributed by other sources in the fov of _ suzaku_. this might indicate an steeper spectral break than observed . on the other hand",
    ", the effects caused by the systematic uncertainty of the nxb background could be large .",
    "for example , if the nxb level is lower by a few percent ( e.g. 2% , which is the nominal value of the nxb uncertainty ; @xcite ) than the assumed value , the true hard x - ray would be higher than the current detection and the spectral break would not be as significant as observed . since there are several upcoming missions , including _",
    "nustar _ @xcite and _ astro - h _",
    "@xcite , which will be capable to image the sky up to @xmath115  kev for the first time , the exploration of pwne , including the one in cta  1 , will leap into a new era in the near future .",
