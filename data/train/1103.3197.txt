    "in this paper , we analyse the long - time dynamics of solutions to the burgers - type equation @xmath1 with small localized initial data , where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is a scalar function .",
    "the key feature of this equation as opposed to the usual burgers equation is that the characteristic speeds are @xmath5 at spatial infinity and @xmath6 at spatial minus infinity : hence , transport is always directed away from the shock interface at @xmath7 and not towards @xmath7 as would be the case for the lax shocks of the standard burgers equation .",
    "we are interested in ( [ e : toy ] ) due to its close connection with the dynamics of coherent structures that arise in reaction - diffusion systems @xmath8 a coherent structure ( or defect ) is a solution @xmath9 of ( [ e : rd ] ) that is time - periodic in an appropriate moving frame @xmath10 and spatially asymptotic to wave - train solutions , which are spatially periodic travelling waves of ( [ e : rd ] ) .",
    "such structures have been observed in many experiments and in various reaction - diffusion models , and we refer to @xcite for references and to figure  [ f:1 ] for an illustration of typical defect profiles . for the sake of simplicity , we shall assume from now on that the speed @xmath11 of the defect we are interested in vanishes , so that the coherent structure is time - periodic .",
    "coherent structures can be classified into several distinct types @xcite that have different stability and multiplicity properties .",
    "this classification involves the group velocities of the asymptotic wave trains , and we therefore briefly review their definition and features .",
    "wave trains of ( [ e : rd ] ) are solutions of the form @xmath12 , where the profile @xmath13 is @xmath14-periodic in the @xmath15-variable . thus , @xmath16 and @xmath17 represent the spatial wave number and the temporal frequency , respectively , of the wave train .",
    "wave trains typically exist as one - parameter families , where the frequency @xmath18 is a function , the so - called nonlinear dispersion relation , of the wave number @xmath16 , which varies in an open interval .",
    "the group velocity @xmath19 of the wave train with wave number @xmath16 is defined as @xmath20 the group velocity is important as it is the speed with which small localized perturbations of a wave train propagate as functions of time @xmath21 , and we refer to figure  [ f:1](iii ) for an illustration and to @xcite for a rigorous justification of this statement .",
    "the classification of coherent structures mentioned above is based on the group velocities @xmath22 of the asymptotic wave trains at @xmath0 .",
    "we are interested in sources for which @xmath23 as illustrated in figure  [ f:1](i ) so that perturbations are transported away from the defect core towards infinity .",
    "sources are important as they actively select wave numbers in oscillatory media ; examples of sources are the nozaki  bekki holes of the complex ginzburg  landau equation .     as a function of @xmath24 for fixed time @xmath21 : the group velocities of the asymptotic wave trains point away from the core of the coherent structure .",
    "panel  ( ii ) illustrates the floquet spectrum of a spectrally stable source : the two eigenvalues at the origin correspond to translations in space and time , which , in contrast to the essential spectrum , can not be moved by exponential weights .",
    "panel  ( iii ) shows the behaviour of small phase @xmath25 or wave number @xmath26 perturbations of a wave train : to leading order , they are transported with speed given by the group velocity @xmath19 without changing their shape @xcite . ]    from now on , we focus on a given source and discuss its stability properties with respect to the reaction - diffusion system ( [ e : rd ] ) .",
    "spectral stability of a source can be investigated through the floquet spectrum of the period map of the linearization of ( [ e : rd ] ) about the time - periodic source .",
    "spectral stability of sources was investigated in @xcite , and we now summarize their findings",
    ". the floquet spectrum of a spectrally stable source will look as indicated in figure  [ f:1](ii ) .",
    "a source @xmath9 has two eigenvalues at the origin with eigenfunctions @xmath27 and @xmath28 ; the associated adjoint eigenfunctions are necessarily exponentially localized , so that the source has a well defined spatial position and temporal phase .",
    "there will also be two curves of essential spectrum that touch the origin and correspond to phase and wave number modulations of the two asymptotic wave trains .",
    "it turns out that the two eigenvalues at the origin can not be removed by posing the linearized problem in exponentially weighted function spaces ; the essential spectrum , on the other hand , can be moved to the left by allowing functions to grow exponentially at infinity .",
    "the nonlinear stability of spectrally stable sources has not yet been established , and we now outline why this is a challenging problem . from a purely technical viewpoint ,",
    "an obvious difficulty is related to the fact that there is no spectral gap between the essential spectrum and the imaginary axis . as discussed above ,",
    "such a gap can be created by posing the linear problem on function spaces that contain exponentially growing functions , but the nonlinear terms will then not even be continuous . to see that these are not just technical obstacles , it is illuminating to discuss the anticipated dynamics near a source from an intuitive perspective . if a source is subjected to a localized perturbation , then one anticipated effect is that the defect core adjusts its position and its temporal phase in response . from its new position , the defect will continue to emit wave trains with the same selected wave number but there will now be a phase difference between the asymptotic wave trains at infinity and those newly emitted near the core .",
    "in other words , we expect to see two phase fronts that travel in opposite directions away from the core as illustrated in figure  [ f:2 ] .",
    "the resulting phase dynamics can be captured by writing the perturbed solution @xmath29 as @xmath30 where we expect that the perturbation @xmath31 of the defect profile decays in time , while the phase @xmath4 resembles an expanding plateau as indicated in figure  [ f:2 ] whose height depends on the initial perturbation through the spatio - temporal displacement of the defect core .    .",
    "the right panel illustrates the profile of the anticipated phase function @xmath4 defined in ( [ e : phase ] ) . ]",
    "the preceding discussion indicates that localized perturbations of a defect will not stay localized but result instead in phase fronts that propagate towards infinity . as a first step towards a general nonlinear stability result for sources in reaction - diffusion systems , we focus here on the burgers - type equation @xmath32 for the phase function @xmath4 introduced in ( [ e : phase ] ) .",
    "the rationale for choosing this model problem is as follows .",
    "first , as established formally in @xcite and proved rigorously in @xcite , the integrated viscous burgers equation captures the phase dynamics of wave trains over long time intervals .",
    "since the burgers equation does not admit sources , we add the artificial advection term on the left - hand side which creates the characteristic speeds @xmath33 at @xmath0 that account for the outgoing group velocities of the asymptotic wave trains of the source .",
    "while the inhomogeneous advection term can be thought of as fixing the position @xmath7 of the core , the equation still has a family of constant solutions , which correspond to different temporal phases of the underlying hypothetical sources .",
    "we therefore feel that gaining a detailed understanding of the long - time dynamics of ( [ e : tm ] ) for small localized initial data will shed significant light on the expected dynamics of sources and on the techniques needed to analyse their stability .",
    "we emphasize that the dynamics of wave trains of reaction - diffusion systems under non - localized phase perturbations was investigated only recently in @xcite ; the methods used there rely on renormalization - group techniques which seem difficult to generalize to sources . on the other hand , the analysis presented here is currently far more limited in terms of the equations it applies to .",
    "the linearization of ( [ e : tm ] ) about @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 the spectrum of the operator in ( [ e : toy_lin ] ) is as shown in figure  [ f:1](ii ) except that there is only one embedded eigenvalue at the origin that can not be moved by exponential weights : the eigenfunction of the eigenvalue at @xmath36 is given by the constant function @xmath37 , and the associated adjoint eigenfunction @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 equation ( [ e : toy_lin ] ) admits ) is the formal adjoint of the linearization of the standard viscous burgers equation @xmath40 about the lax shock @xmath41 $ ] with @xmath42 , whose green s function can be found via the linearized cole ",

    "hopf transformation does not , however , extend to more general equations , and we therefore pursue here a different approach that , we hope , will also be useful when investigating the nonlinear stability of sources in general reaction - diffusion systems .    in order to analyze the dynamics of ( [ e : tm ] ) in a way that may also be applicable in the case of a general reaction - diffusion equation , we need to find an appropriate ansatz for small - amplitude solutions . to do so",

    "note that the leading behavior @xmath71 corresponds to a plateau with height @xmath72 of length @xmath73 that spreads outward with speed @xmath33 .",
    "the main result of this paper is as follows .",

    "furthermore , there is a @xmath81 with @xmath82 such that @xmath83 and @xmath65 satisfies @xmath84 for all @xmath85 . in particular , @xmath86 as @xmath53 for each fixed @xmath87 .",
    "note that our result assumes that the initial condition is strongly localized in space .",
    "we believe that this assumption can be relaxed significantly ; for the purposes of this paper , however , phase fronts are created even by highly localized initial data , and the key difficulties are therefore present already in the more specialized situation of theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "the exponential convergence of @xmath64 reflects the intuition that a source has a well - defined position due to the exponential localization of the adjoint eigenfunction @xmath38 .",
    "the asymptotics of the perturbation @xmath88 is given by moving gaussians that decay only like @xmath89 for each fixed @xmath74 , rather than with @xmath90 as expected from the dynamics of the viscous burgers equation .",
    "this weaker result is due to the form ( [ e : ansatz ] ) of our ansatz , which effectively creates a nonlinear term that is proportional to @xmath91 for some function @xmath92 .",
    "while this term resembles the term @xmath93 in burgers equation , it does not respect the conservation - law structure .",
    "thus , we only obtain decay at the above rate .",
    "although this may not be optimal , it allows us to avoid terms that grow logarithmically in the nonlinear iteration in ",

    "we do not know if it is possible to improve this rate to @xmath94 by adjusting our ansatz appropriately .",
