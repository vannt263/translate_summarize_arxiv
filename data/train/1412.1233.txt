    "they also play an active role in the studies of stellar population synthesis ( e.g. , hurley et al .",
    "2002 ; li & han 2008 ) .",
    "however , it is very challenging to discriminate a binary system from a single star and to characterize the binary stars ( e.g. , the binary fraction , denoted as @xmath12 , and the distributions of mass ratios , orbital periods , and eccentricities ) for different stellar populations and galactic environments ( see the review by duchne & kraus 2013 and references therein ) .",
    "a variety of techniques , visual , spectroscopic , photometric , and astrometric , have been developed to search for binaries , leading to respectively the discoveries of visual , spectroscopic , eclipse , and astrometric binaries .",
    "spectroscopic , eclipse , and astrometric binaries are found by periodic changes in the stellar radial velocity , brightness , and positions , respectively .",
    "all those techniques are biased in one way or other , and in many cases limited to bright stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "for example , spectroscopic and photometric techniques are biased to close binaries consisting of stars of similar masses .",
    "both techniques are also time consuming .",
    "visual binaries discovered by high angular resolution imaging techniques such as speckle interferometry are biased to long - period , similar - mass binaries .",
    "astrometric binaries are biased to binaries of intermediate periods and currently limited to bright stars observed with the hipparcos . with the advent of millions of stellar spectra , collected by for example , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) and the lamost ( cui et al . 2012 ) spectroscopic surveys ( zhao et al . 2012 ; deng et al .",
    "2012 ; liu et al .",
    "2014 ) , spectral binaries have also been identified as those whose spectra show two distinct sets of photospheric features , such as the white - dwarf - main - sequence binaries ( e.g. , rebassa - mansergas et al .",
    "2007 ; ren et al . 2013 ) .",
    "spectral binaries are insensitive to the binary separation , but limited to binaries composed of stars of distinct spectral characteristics , such as a white dwarf and a late type star .",
    "binaries can also be identified indirectly and statistically . for clusters consisting of a simple stellar population ,",
    "binary stars are brighter by up to 0.75 mag above the sequence of single stars .",
    "the magnitude spread of color - magnitude diagram of a cluster can thus be used to constrain the binary fraction and mass ratio distribution statistically ( e.g. , hu et al . 2010 ; li et al .",

    ", they obtained for the first time the metallicity - dependent stellar loci in the sdss colors and find that the fit residuals can be fully accounted for by the uncertainties in photometric measurements , metallicity determinations and calibration , suggesting that the intrinsic widths of the loci are at maximum of a few mmag if not zero .",
    "more interestingly , the distributions of residuals are asymmetric , pointing to the presence of a significant population of binaries . as we shall show in the current work , by modeling the distributions of residuals it is possible to reveal the binary fraction of field ms stars .    in this companion paper",
    ", we propose a stellar locus outlier ( slot ) method to determine the binary fractions statistically .",
    "compared to the previous techniques , the slot method is solely based on color deviations relative to the metallicity - dependent stellar loci , and thus is independent of the separations ( orbital periods ) of binaries if one neglects the small fraction of spatially resolved wide binaries ( semi - major axes @xmath17 100au ; chanam 2007 ) .",
    "the method is also insensitive to the assumed mass - ratio distribution . because binaries of intermediate mass - ratios contribute most of the observed deviations in the color - color space , while those of close to unity or very small mass - ratios contribute little .",
    "with modern photometric surveys ( providing accurate colors ) and large scale spectroscopic surveys such as the sdss and lamost ( providing robust estimates of metallicity and surface gravity ) , the slot method is capable providing model - free estimates of the binary fraction for large samples of stars of different populations .",
    "when combining results from other techniques , the method can also provide strong constraints on the distributions of orbital periods and mass ratios of binary stars .    in this paper , we will introduce the slot method , apply the method to stars of the sdss stripe82 spectroscopically targeted by the sdss and lamost . and present a model - free estimate of the binary faction for field fgk stars .",

    "for the four populations , the binary fractions are @xmath316 , @xmath317 , @xmath318 , and @xmath319 , respectively , suggesting that thin and thick disk stars have similar binary fractions , whereas for halo stars , the fraction seems to be significantly higher . applying the method to the lamost sample yields consistent results .",

    "however , for ( sub-)samples of narrower color and metallicity ranges , for example , the sdss and lamost subsamples of individual bins of color and metallicity in the current work , the derived binary fractions are barely affected by the color and metallicity distributions of the sample stars .",
    "the binary fractions derived depend on , but are insensitive to , the assumed mass ratio distribution of binary stars . in this work ,",

    "although the slot method suffers from little bias , the samples could be biased .",
    "the samples used in this work include only stars of spectral snr higher than a specific value , thus may introduce a malmquist bias that favors brighter binaries . given the good snrs and the wide range of magnitude of the sdss sample stars , the effects of malmquist bias for the sdss sample are likely to be small . for the lamost sample , the effects could be somewhat larger .    in the current work ,",
    "we have neglected binary stars composed of a normal star and a compact object , such as a white dwarf , a neutron stars , or a black hole .",
    "however , the fraction of such systems should be negligible compared to binaries consisting of two normal stars . in the current work , we have also neglected wide binaries that are spatially resolved in the sdss images .",
    "they would be missed by the method . however , given that the median distances of the sdss and lamost sample stars are respectively about 2.0 and 1.0 kpc and that 90 per cent of the targets are at least 1.0 and 0.6kpc away , the numbers of such systems that have been left out are likely to be very small ( e.g. , sesar et al . 2008 ) .",
    "superpositions of two unassociated stars by chance are also neglected , considering the high galactic latitudes of stripe 82 .",
    "systems consisting of triple or more stars are also neglected , which shall be regarded as binaries as the effects of the third and higher - order companions on the combined colors are negligible .",
    "the slot method proposed in this work is limited to stars spectroscopically targeted due to the requirement of robust estimates of metallicity and surface gravity . given the strong dependence of @xmath13 color on metallicity ,",
    "it is worth exploring the dependence of colors @xmath14 and @xmath16 as a function of @xmath3 and @xmath13 in the future . with sophisticated modeling ,",
    "it is possible to extend the method to estimate binary fractions for a complete sample of stars using photometric data alone .",
    "the slot method is only applied to stripe 82 in the current work , as stripe 82 has extremely well - calibrated photometry with colors accurate to a few mmag . applying the method to all stars spectroscopically targeted by the sdss and lamost surveys , with photometry from the sdss ,",
    "is also possible , once the sdss colors have been further re - calibrated using the stellar color regression method ( yuan et al .",
    "2014a ) .",
    "the slot method can be applied to star clusters using accurate photometric data alone , as cluster member stars presumably have the same metallicity . by analyzing the offsets in colors as well as in brightness",
    ", one can constrain both the binary fraction and mass ratio distribution of cluster member stars . if accurate distances to individual field stars",
    "are available , for example from the gaia satellite ( perryman et al .",
    "2001 ) , the offsets in colors and brightness can also be used to constrain the binary fraction and mass ratio distribution for field stars .",
    "binary fraction for field stars can also be estimated by variations in stellar radial velocities from multi - epoch spectroscopy ( gao et al .",
    "thanks to the on - going lamost surveys , multi - epoch spectroscopic data have increased significantly . a significant fraction of stars targeted by the lamost has been observed twice or multiple times . by combining the offsets in colors and the variations in radial velocity",
    ", one can constrain both the binary fraction and orbital period distribution very well . in addition , a color offset ",

    "<S> we propose a stellar locus outlier ( slot ) method to determine the binary fraction of main - sequence stars statistically . </S>",
    "<S> the method is sensitive to neither the period nor mass - ratio distributions of binaries , and able to provide model - free estimates of binary fraction for large numbers of stars of different populations in large survey volumes . </S>",
    "<S> we have applied the slot method to two samples of stars from the sdss stripe82 , constructed by combining the re - calibrated sdss photometric data with respectively the spectroscopic information from the sdss and lamost surveys . for the sdss spectroscopic sample </S>",
    "<S> , we find an average binary fraction for field fgk stars of 41%@xmath02% . </S>",
    "<S> the fractions decrease toward late spectral types , and are respectively 44%@xmath05% , 43%@xmath03% , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 for stars of @xmath3 colors between 0.3  0.6 , 0.6  0.9 , 0.9  1.2 , and 1.2  1.6mag . </S>",
    "<S> a modest metallicity dependence is also found . the fraction decreases with increasing metallicity . for stars of [ fe / h]between @xmath4  0.0 , @xmath5  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 , @xmath6  @xmath5 , and @xmath7  @xmath6dex , the inferred binary fractions are @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we have further divided the sample into stars from the thin disk , the thick disk , the transition zone between them , and the halo . </S>",
    "<S> the results suggest that the galactic thin and thick disks have comparable binary fractions , whereas the galactic halo contains a significantly larger fraction of binaries . applying the method to the lamost spectroscopic sample yields consistent results . </S>",
    "<S> finally , other potential applications and future work with the method are discussed . </S>"
