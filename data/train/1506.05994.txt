    "0.1 cm the parity - violating ( chiral ) gauge symmetries and spontaneous / explicit breaking of these symmetries for the hierarchy of fermion masses and mixing angles have been at the center of a conceptual elaboration that has played a major role in donating to mankind the beauty of the sm for fundamental particle physics .",
    "on the one hand the _ composite _ higgs - boson model or the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) @xcite with four - fermion operators , and on the other the phenomenological model @xcite of the _ elementary _ higgs boson , they are effectively equivalent for the sm at low energies and provide an elegant and simple description for the electroweak symmetry breaking and intermediate gauge boson masses .",
    "the experimental results of higgs - boson mass 126 gev @xcite and top - quark mass 173 gev @xcite begin to shed light on this most elusive and fascinating arena of fundamental particle physics .    in order to accommodate high - dimensional operators of fermion fields in the sm framework of a well - defined quantum field theory at the high - energy scale @xmath2 , it is essential and necessary to study : ( i ) what physics beyond the sm at the scale @xmath2 explains the origin of these operators ; ( ii ) which dynamics of these operators undergo in terms of their dimensional couplings ( e.g. , @xmath3 ) and energy scale @xmath4 ; ( iii ) associating to these dynamics , where infrared ( ir ) and ultraviolet ( uv ) stable fixed points of these couplings locate and what characteristic energy scale is ; ( iv ) in the ir domain and uv domain ( scaling regions ) of these stable ir and uv fixed points , which operators become physically relevant ( effectively dimension-4 ) and renormalizable following renormalization group ( rg ) equations ( scaling laws ) , and other irrelevant operators are suppressed by the cutoff at least @xmath5 .",
    "the strong technicolor dynamics of extended gauge theories at the tev scale was invoked @xcite to have a natural scheme incorporating the relevant four - fermion operator @xmath6 of the @xmath7-condensate model of bardeen , hill and lindner ( bhl ) @xcite and notations will be given later in eq .",
    "( [ bhlx ] ) . this relevant four - fermion operator ( [ bhl ] ) undergoes the dynamics of spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) in the ir domain ( small @xmath8 ) of infrared fixed point @xmath9 ( critical value ) associated with the ssb and characteristic energy scale ( vev ) @xmath10 gev .",
    "the analysis of this composite higgs boson model was made @xcite to show the low - energy effective lagrangian , rg equations , the composite goldstone modes ( pseudoscalars @xmath11 ) for the longitudinal modes of massive @xmath0 and @xmath12 gauge bosons , and the composite scalar ( @xmath13 ) for the higgs boson in the sm .",
    "on the other hand , these relevant operators can be constructed on the basis of phenomenology of the sm at low - energies . in 1989 ,",
    "several authors @xcite suggested that the symmetry breakdown of the sm could be a dynamical mechanism of the njl type that intimately involves the top quark at the high - energy scale @xmath2 .",
    "since then , many models based on this idea have been studied @xcite .",
    "the low - energy sm physics was supposed to be achieved by the rg equations in the ir domain of the ir - stable fixed point with @xmath10 gev @xcite .",

    "this indicates that a second - order phase transition from the ssb phase to the sm gauge symmetric phase takes place at the critical point @xmath18 .",
    "in addition the effective quartic coupling of composite higgs bosons vanishing at @xmath19 tev scales indicates the characteristic energy scale of such phase transition .",
    "the energy scale @xmath20 is much lower than the cutoff scale @xmath2 ( @xmath21 ) so that the fine - tuning ( hierarchy ) problem of fermion masses @xmath22 or the pseudoscalar decay constant @xmath23 can be avoided @xcite .    in this article , after a short review that recalls and explains the quantum - gravity origin of four - fermion operators at the cutoff @xmath2 , the ssb and @xmath24-condensate model , we show that due to four - fermion operators ( i ) there are the sm gauge symmetric vertexes of quark - lepton interactions ; ( ii ) the one - particle - irreducible ( 1pi ) vertex function of @xmath0-boson coupling becomes approximately vectorlike at tev scale .",
    "both interacting vertexes contribute the explicit symmetry breaking ( esb ) terms to schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equations for fermion self - energy functions . as a result ,",
