    "the nodal domains of a ( real ) wavefunction are regions of equal sign , and are bounded by the nodal lines where the wavefunction vanishes .",
    "even a superficial look at the nodal domains of a quantum wavefunction reveals the separable or chaotic nature of the quantum system @xcite . in separable systems",
    ", one observes a grid of intersecting nodal lines , and consequently a checkerboard - like nodal domain pattern . in ( quantum ) chaotic systems on the other hand , the nodal domains form a highly disordered structure , resembling the geometry found in critical percolation .",
    "et al _ @xcite argued that also the statistics of the number of nodal domains reflects the fundamental difference between separable and chaotic quantum systems .",
    "bogomolny and schmit @xcite conjectured that the nodal domain statistics of chaotic wavefunctions in two dimensions can be deduced from the theory of critical percolation .",
    "they built a percolation model for the nodal domains which allowed them to calculate exactly the distribution of numbers of domains .",
    "its predictions have been confirmed numerically as far as nodal counting and the area distribution of nodal domains are concerned . while quantum wavefunctions display long - range correlations , the critical percolation model assumes that such correlations can be neglected on distances of the order of a wave length .",
    "one may thus expect that _ some _ nodal properties in real wavefunctions are not well described by critical percolation .",
    "the main motivation of the present study was to investigate the limits of applicability of the short - range percolation model .",
    "the object we will address is related to the distribution of shapes of nodal lines in the random wave ensemble . to be precise",
    ", we will calculate approximately the probability , that a nodal line matches a given reference line up to a given precision @xmath0 .",
    "we will examine the statistics of nodal lines within the monochromatic random wave model , which is a good description of the eigenfunctions of a quantum billiard in the semiclassical limit @xcite .",
    "the monochromatic random wave ensemble consists of solutions of the helmholtz wave equation for a fixed energy @xmath1 @xmath2 furthermore the random function @xmath3 is picked up from a gaussian distribution , i.e. higher order correlations of @xmath3 can be expressed through the two - point correlation function @xmath4 by virtue of wick s theorem . a convenient representation of @xmath3 is given by the superposition of cylindrical waves with gaussian distributed amplitudes @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the bessel functions of the first kind , and @xmath7 is the position in polar coordinates .",
    "the gaussian random variables obey @xmath8 to render @xmath3 real , and have correlations @xmath9 .",
    "using the addition theorem for the bessel functions , one finds for the two - point correlation function @xmath10 it displays in fact long - range correlations , which decay with a power law . in order to access the relevance of the long - range correlations , we compare the monochromatic random wave ensemble with another gaussian ensemble of random functions , which , however , does not have long - range correlations , and",
    "is characterized by the correlation function @xmath11 for the latter ensemble the applicability of the critical ( short - range ) percolation picture is evident @xcite , since the sign of the random function is not significantly correlated for distances @xmath12 .",
    "figure [ corrfu ] shows the spatial correlation functions @xmath13 .",
    "( solid ) , and @xmath14 ( dotted ) as a function of @xmath15.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    we now briefly introduce the central object of this article .",
    "a detailed derivation will be given in section [ section : diff ] .",
    "consider a smooth , closed reference curve @xmath16 in the plane , which is parametrized by its arclength @xmath17 .",
    "the integral of the square of the amplitude of a random function @xmath18 along this curve @xmath19 is itself a random variable .",
    "it samples the function not only at a discrete set of points , but along a one - dimensional subset of the plane",
    ". it should be well suited to detect the long - range correlations of the random field @xmath3    now assume that @xmath3 has a nodal line very close to the given reference line .",
    "then @xmath20 will be small in a sense which will be explained later .",
    "thus , by calculating the distribution of @xmath20 , its cumulants or moments , one obtains the relative importance of the given reference line @xmath16 . we will perform these computations for a circular reference line both for the random wave ensemble and for the short - range ensemble defined above .",
    "we will study in particular the scaling properties of the cumulants of @xmath20 as functions of the radius ( typical size ) of the reference curve .",
    "we shall show that they obey a scaling law which distinguishes clearly between the short - range ensemble and the monochromatic random wave ensemble . to understand the significance of these cumulants",
    ", we shall consider an _ approximate _ expression for the probability that a nodal line is found inside a strip of width @xmath0 about the reference line .",
    "we shall show that this function , when expanded in powers of @xmath21 generates the @xmath20 cumulants .",
    "its scaling properties with the size parameters , however , are less sensitive to the correlations assumed for the underlying random functions model . strictly speaking",
    ", the function we compute is a measure of the intensity of fluctuations of the field @xmath3 along the line , which are certainly small when a nodal line approximates the reference line , but can also be small if different nodal lines which just avoid crossing , are within @xmath0 from the reference line .",
    "since near avoided crossings have low probability ( see @xcite ) we believe that the function we compute is closely related to the true probability .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized in the following way .",
    "the next section describes in detail the new concept which we introduce to the morphological study of nodal lines , that is , the density of line shapes .",
    "once this is done , a formal expression for the density , expressed in terms of @xmath20 is provided , and computed explicitly for particular shapes  circles ( section [ section : circles ] ) within a reasonable and calculable approximation .",
    "these densities are evaluated for random waves , and for the short - range ensemble .",
    "we consider two - dimensional , gaussian random fields , and a prescribed ( closed ) reference line .",
    "we shall propose a proper definition of the density of nodal lines which match the reference line in a random field ( or equivalently , the probability that a nodal line with a prescribed form shows up in a guassian random field ) . compared to problems , where the density of ( critical , nodal ) points of a gaussian field is calculated @xcite ,",
    "we enter here a new dimension and consider the density of one - dimensional strings instead of zero - dimensional , point - like objects . in order to obtain a well - defined and finite theory",
    ", we have to regularize the theory by dilating the reference curve to a thin tube with constant thickness @xmath22 and compute the probability , that a nodal line is completely inside this tube ",
    "see figure ( [ almostcircle ] ) .",
    "assume now , that a function @xmath18 has a nodal line close to a reference curve @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the arclength .",
    "the normal distance @xmath23 of the nodal line from the reference curve can be obtained via linearization @xmath24 yielding @xmath25 the unit vector @xmath26 is normal to the curve @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath27 denotes the corresponding normal derivative .",
    "the probability , that a nodal line lies in a _",
    "tube @xmath28 is , although well defined , not accessible by analytical means . at this point",
    "we must resort to further approximations , which will eventually lead us to a tractable model , at the cost of losing the rigour of the original object defined above . as a first step we replace the box shaped cross section by a smooth gaussian and consider instead the expectation value @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the line integral along the reference line , and @xmath31 .",
    ".,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    however , even the computation of this quantity poses unsurmountable difficulties .",
    "@xmath32 is a ratio of two ( in general non - independent ) gaussian variables , which is itself non - gaussian . in order to obtain a tractable expression we approximate the integral @xmath33 by a mean - field type expression @xmath34 where the latter step requires isotropy of the distribution of the random field @xmath3 .",
    "the final approximation for the shape probability now reads @xmath35 or @xmath36 where @xmath37 is an integral operator with ( symmetric ) kernel @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the corresponding eigenvalues .",
    "the operator @xmath37 is the correlation function of the field @xmath3 , restricted to the given curve .",
    "it is positive semi - definite and has a _",
    "finite _ trace @xmath40 , thus its eigenvalues @xmath41 have an accumulation point at zero .",
    "the final expression for the logarithm of probability ( [ finall ] ) is the starting point of our investigation .",
    "it should reflect the relevant features of the inaccessible hard - tube probability , and is an interesting object in its own right .",
    "it takes into consideration the random field @xmath3 along the whole reference curve @xmath16 .",
    "we remark here again that the final approximation for the probability only tests whether @xmath3 is small along the given curve ",
    "it is not able to resolve nearly avoided intersections which are placed next to the reference curve .",
    "@xmath42 is the generating function for the cumulants of the random variable @xmath43 @xmath44 where the expansion parameter is @xmath45 .",
    "it is _ also _ the generating function of the traces of powers of the operator @xmath37 . in fact , expanding @xmath42 in terms of @xmath46 , i.e. for large @xmath47 , one finds @xmath48 comparing the two expansions , we see that @xmath49    as mentioned in the introduction our goal is to compare two different gaussian random fields in two dimensions with correlation functions @xmath50 , namely @xmath51 @xmath52 is the correlation function of the monochromatic random wave ensemble with a sharply defined energy @xmath53 . consequently , it displays long - range correlations .",
    "@xmath14 is a typical short - range ensemble .",
    "note that the @xmath54 are normalized such that @xmath55 this implies an equal nodal line density @xmath56 for the long , and short - range ensemble .",

    "the kernel of the operator @xmath37 reads for the monochromatic random wave ensemble with correlation function @xmath52 @xmath58 where @xmath59 are angles describing positions on the circle .",
