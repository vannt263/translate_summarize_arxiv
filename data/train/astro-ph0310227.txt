    "the eruptive variable v838 monocerotis , first reported as a possible nova on 2002 january 6.6 @xcite , experienced three significant photometric outbursts in early 2002 @xcite . from pre - outburst to its maximum brightness during the second outburst , v838 mon brightened by over nine magnitudes in v , from 15.85 to 6.66 @xcite .",
    "v838 mon also exhibited significant spectroscopic variability in early 2002 : neutral metal and s - process lines were observed following the first outburst @xcite , ionized metal lines were noted following the second outburst @xcite , and neutral metal and molecular lines were observed following the third outburst @xcite . v838",
    "mon exhibited intrinsic polarization on 2002 february 8 @xcite .",
    "polarimetric observations after 2002 february 13 only detected the presence of an interstellar polarization ( isp ) component @xcite .",
    "v838 mon developed a light echo by 2002 february 17 @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained imaging polarimetry of this light echo with hst acs , and suggested a distance of 3 to 7 kpc to v838 mon , although a wide range of other distances have been estimated ( e.g. see discussion in wisniewski et al .",
    "2003 and tylenda 2003 ) . in late september and early october of 2002 ,",
    "v838 mon s spectral type had evolved to `` later than m10-iii '' @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a weak blue continuum was detected by several groups , suggesting that a binary component of spectral type b3v might be present @xcite .",
    "recent mmt spectra confirm this secondary component ( starrfield , private communication ) .",
    "given the magnitude and complexity of the variability exhibited by v838 mon , it is not surprising that there is still great uncertainty regarding the exact nature of this object . in this paper , we present imaging polarimetry observations of v838 mon and its surrounding field obtained in 2002 october .",
    "these observations allow us to further interpret the evolution of the circumstellar matter near v838 mon since its major outbursts .",
    "we obtained polarimetric measurements of v838 mon and its field in 2002 october at the ctio 1.5 m telescope . the standard cassegrain focus imaging camera with the f/13.5 ( 0.24 arcsec pixel@xmath1 )",
    "configuration was modified by the addition of a rotatable half - wave plate followed by a fixed analyzer placed before the second filter wheel .",
    "the analyzer was a double calcite block whose optical axes had been crossed to minimize astigmatism and color effects , which produced two orthogonally polarized images of each object in the field .",
    "one polarization modulation is covered for each 90@xmath0 rotation of the waveplate . for our v , r , and i observations of v838 mon , we took images with the waveplate rotated through 8 positions 22.5@xmath0 apart .",
    "further details about this polarimeter can be found in @xcite , @xcite , & @xcite .",
    "after basic image processing in iraf , we performed aperture photometry on the fields .",
    "the reduction package pccdpack @xcite , which calculates linear polarization from a least squares solution of the photometry in the 8 waveplate positions ( @xmath2 ) , was then applied .",
    "the residuals at each waveplate position with respect to the expected @xmath3 curve constitute the uncertainties in our data ; these are consistent with the theoretically expected photon noise errors @xcite .",
    "each object whose polarization is reported has been carefully checked for contamination effects due to close neighbors ; objects which contained such contamination were excluded from the present study .    polarized and unpolarized",
    "standard stars were monitored nightly throughout the eleven nights of our observing run , and the stability of the polarimeter was reflected in the consistency of these standard star observations . comparing our observations of polarized standard stars to available literature data , we transformed our polarization measurements to a standard equatorial system .",
    "this transformation is accurate to a position angle ( pa ) of better than 1@xmath0 .",
    "instrumental polarization was consistently less than 0.05@xmath4 .",
    "note that the simultaneous observation of the dual orthogonally polarized images of each target in each waveplate position allows for accurate polarimetry to be performed even under non - photometric skies , as all sky polarization is practically canceled @xcite .",
    "we summarize our observations of v838 mon , along with polarimetry of this object from the literature , in columns 1 - 5 of table 1 .",
    "over small spatial regions , where variations in the distribution of dust and magnetic fields can be assumed to be small , field stars located at similar distances exhibit similar levels of interstellar polarization ( isp ) . to study the intrinsic polarization of an astrophysical object ,",
    "it is often beneficial to examine the polarization of spatially nearby field stars , located at similar distances , to get a statistical measure of the isp along a particular line of sight .",
    "we measured the polarization in v , r , and i of most of the field stars surrounding v838 monocerotis ; a sample of these results is given in table 2 and a complete listing of these data is available online .",
    "figure 1a shows a v band image obtained on 2002 october 16 at the ctio 0.9 m , and includes numerical references to stars shown in figure 1b and tabulated in table 2 .",
    "a plot of the spatial distribution of the polarization of these field stars in the v band is shown in figure 1b .",
    "we note that three stars near v838 mon show very similar polarizations to each other , star # 2 , star # 3 , and star # 5 .",
    "furthermore , these stars exhibit very similar polarizations to the isp previously estimated for v838 mon @xcite .",
    "we plot the wavelength dependence of the polarization of these three objects in figure 2 , and overlay the modified serkowski law @xcite description of v838 mon s interstellar polarization with @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the good agreement shown in this figure supports the previously determined isp , derived entirely from spectropolarimetry .",
    "furthermore , these results imply that stars # 2 , # 3 , and # 5 are located at similar distances as v838 mon .",
    "future efforts to determine the distance to v838 mon should ensure consistency with these three neighboring objects .",
    "we subtracted the isp along the line of sight @xcite from our observations of v838 mon to determine its intrinsic polarization .",
    "the non - zero results ( columns 6 - 8 , table 1 ) show that on 2002 oct 22 - 24 v838 mon once again exhibited a significant intrinsic polarization component .",
    "interestingly , the magnitude of intrinsic polarization present on 2002 october 22 - 24 is similar to that observed on 2002 february 8 ; however , the position angle of this scattered light differs by roughly 90@xmath0 , e.g. a pa `` flip '' has occurred .",
    "the presence of an intrinsic polarization component can be interpreted as a signature of light scattering off circumstellar material which is distributed in an asymmetrical geometry . the intrinsic polarization reported here and by @xcite",
    "is produced in a region immediately surrounding the unresolved central star , and as such is different from the reported polarization of v838 mon s light echo @xcite . in our observations of the unresolved source ,",
    "the observed polarization is roughly the ratio of the scattered to total ( i.e. direct plus scattered ) light received .",
    "thus the renewed intrinsic polarization component suggests that either a ) a new source of asymmetrical circumstellar material , i.e. a new source of scatterers , formed around v838 mon in 2002 october ; b ) the opacity of the circumstellar envelope surrounding v838 mon evolved significantly between february 5 to february 13 to october 22 - 24 , thereby changing the dominant source of scattered light over time ; c ) the illuminating source had changed ; or d ) a combination of the aforementioned scenarios .",
    "@xcite interpreted an observed wavelength - dependent pa flip in polarimetric observations of an unresolved b[e ] star as evidence of a bipolar nebula .",
    "these authors argued that at short wavelengths an optically thick circumstellar disk blocked out most starlight and thus little scattered light ( with a pa aligned along the polar axis ) originated from the equatorial disk .",
    "most of the polarized light at short wavelengths originated from the polar regions , where the resulting pa would be aligned with the equatorial disk . at long wavelengths , where the disk was optically thin , the dominant source of scattered light was the equatorial disk region , not the polar regions .",
    "the net effect of such a wavelength dependent opacity effect was the production of a 90@xmath0 pa flip in the polarization signal at the wavelength where the equatorial and polar regions contributed equal amounts of scattered light .",
    "we suggest that a similar type of scenario might explain the renewed intrinsic polarization component and pa flip in v838 mon . on 2002",
    "february 8 , v838 mon had an intrinsic polarization component , indicating the presence of an asymmetrical distribution of circumstellar material , initially suggested to be a flattened circumstellar envelope @xcite .",
    "we postulate that at this initial stage , the observed scattered light originated primarily from specific physical locations , e.g. the polar region . as the opacity of the circumstellar material evolved over time ,",
    "specifically as the opacity of the equatorial material decreased , we suggest that the contribution of scattered light from the polar and equatorial regions were nearly equivalent .",
    "thus , viewed as an unresolved object , the scattered light from the circumstellar envelope would appear to be unpolarized , consistent with observations in late 2002 february and march @xcite . as the envelope continued to evolve and the equatorial region experienced a further decline in opacity",
    ", one would expect the equatorial region to slowly emerge as the dominant source of scattered light .",
    "this re - emergence of a dominant ( and secondary ) scattering region would produce an intrinsic polarization component oriented 90@xmath0 from the original position angle .",
    "the projection of the intrinsic pa of this envelope onto the sky ( 2 @xmath10 , measured n to e ) is not inconsistent with the overall morphology seen in the hst acs images @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic pa of the polar region is also not inconsistent with the direction of the hole in the hst acs light echo images .",
    "we note that the opposite relative opacity changes would produce a similar pa flip .",
    "the scattered light in the circumstellar envelope could have initially been dominated by an optically thin disk . as this equatorial material dispersed ,",
    "the scattered light from the equatorial and polar regions could have balanced , producing zero intrinsic polarization . over time , expansion of the disk could have evacuated the equatorial region , causing the polar region to emerge as the dominant source of scattered light .",
    "followup infrared ( ir ) imaging polarimetry would be valuable in providing additional constraints on the nature of v838 mon s circumstellar envelope . based upon infrared ( ir ) light and color curves ,",
    "@xcite suggest that a dust shell had formed around the central star by 2002 april .",
    "if in early 2002 this dust formed in the equatorial regions as described in the aforementioned first scenario , i.e. an initial thick equatorial and thin polar region , then the ir polarization position angle would be the same as that quoted in this paper .    as described in the introduction of this paper , v838 mon appears to have a binary companion .",
    "polarimetric observations of mass transfer binary systems show some degree of periodicity and scattering at a constant pa , defined by the orbital plane of the system @xcite .",
    "the observed pa flip in v838 mon s intrinsic polarization , along with the lack of any apparent periodicity , suggest that binarity is not the dominant source of scatterers responsible for the observed intrinsic polarization component .    in summary ,",
    "the polarization of field stars confirms the previously suggested interstellar polarization along the line of sight to v838 mon .",
    "we find strong evidence of a renewed intrinsic polarization component in v838 mon , at a position angle nearly 90@xmath0 from that present on 2002 february 8 .",
    "we suggest that these observations indicate an evolution of the circumstellar environment of v838 mon , possibly characterized by : 1 ) an initially optically thick equatorial disk which contributed a limited amount of scattered light ; 2 ) a subsequent decline in disk opacity resulted in a balance of scattered light produced by the polar and equatorial regions ; and 3 ) the further decline in the opacity of the equatorial disk finally allowed the equatorial region to become the dominant source of scattered light",
    ". continued spectropolarimetric monitoring of v838 mon is strongly encouraged , as such observations would enable detailed modeling of the circumstellar environment of this unique object to be performed .",
