    "psr j0537@xmath06910 is a crab - like pulsar embedded in the supernova remnant n157b in the 30 doradus region located at the centre of the lmc .",
    "this supernova belongs to the rare class of crab - like remnants @xcite distinguished by their centrally - filled morphology and non - thermal x - ray spectra , whose emission is predominantly powered by the young pulsar at the center .",
    "psr j0537@xmath06910 is the most rapidly rotating pulsar associated with a snr ( @xmath1=16.1 ms ) , twice as fast as the crab pulsar , with a period derivative of @xmath2=5.17@xmath310@xmath4 s s@xmath5 , a rotational energy loss rate of @xmath6 erg s@xmath5 , a magnetic field at the neutron star surface of @xmath7 g and a braking age of @xmath8 yr in agreement with the predicted snr age @xcite .",
    "it represents the oldest known crab - like pulsar .",
    "pulsed emission was first discovered in the x - ray range by rxte / pca @xcite and soon after confirmed by bepposax @xcite and rosat / hri @xcite .",
    "the light curve is characterized by a narrow pulse shape with a full width duty cycle of about 10% @xcite .",
    "the 210 kev pulsed spectrum has been modeled with a simple power law : rxte+asca measured a spectral index of 1.6@xmath90.4 and a 210 flux of ( 6.7@xmath90.6)@xmath310@xmath10 erg @xmath11 s@xmath5 @xcite , in agreement with the bepposax values of 1.1@xmath90.4 and ( 5.1@xmath91.1)@xmath310@xmath10 erg @xmath11 s@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the source shows intense glitch activity : 6 glitch events , with a mean amplitude in the frequency change of @xmath12=0.36@xmath310@xmath13 , have been observed during the almost 3 years monitoring campaign performed by rxte @xcite .",
    "no pulsed emission have been detected at radio wavelengths since now @xcite .",
    "the rxte observations considered in our analysis were performed between 26 march and 19 december 2001 .",
    "we used pca @xcite accumulated in `` good xenon '' telemetry mode ( 1@xmath14s accuracy ) selecting all detector layer to increase the s / n ratio of the pulsation .",
    "standard selection criteria were applied on the observation data excluding time intervals correspondent to south atlantic anomaly passage and when earth limb was less than 10@xmath15 and angular distance between the source position and the pointing of the satellite was larger than 0.02@xmath15 .",
    "all analysed observations were pointing to psr j0537@xmath06910 and are relative to the same gain epoque .",
    "the total exposure is about 1300 ks .    the narrow field instruments onboard bepposax @xcite observed lmc field several times during its life . for our analysis , we selected the observations pointing at n157b and considered data from the two imaging detectors lecs ( 0.110 kev ) and mecs ( 1.610 kev ) for a total exposure of 29 ks and 89 ks , respectively . in both instruments ,",
    "events were extracted from a circular region centred at the source position with a radius of 3 which maximize the signal - to - noise ratio of the pulsed component . the lecs energy range 0.11.0 kev was not included in the analysis because of the low statistical significance of the pulsed emission due to the presence of a contribution from the hot gas of 30 doradus @xcite .",
    "the utc arrivals times of all selected events were first converted to the solar system barycentre using the ( j2000 ) pulsar position @xmath16=5@xmath17",
    "37@xmath18 47.2@xmath19 and @xmath20=-69@xmath21 10 23 \" @xcite and the jpl2000 planetary ephemeris ( de200 , @xcite ) . for each observation",
    ", we searched the pulsed frequency @xmath22 using the folding technique in a range centred at the value computed with the pulsar ephemeris reported by @xcite .",
    "the central time of each observation was chosen as reference epoque and the corresponding frequency was estimated by fitting the @xmath23 peak with a gaussian .",
    "frequency errors at 1@xmath24 level were computed from the interval corresponding to a unit decrement with respect to the maximum in the @xmath23 curve .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "1 shows the frequencies obtained for bepposax ( triangles ) and rxte ( stars ) together with the linear ephemeris quoted by @xcite ( dotted line ) ; residuals respect to this relation are presented in the bottom panel .",
    "the highest significance of the pulsation is reached in the energy intervals 2.530 kev in rxte data and 1.010 kev in bepposax data .",
    "the rxte profile is shown in fig .",
    "2 : it is characterized by a narrow single peak with a duty cycle of 0.28 at zero level .",
    "fitting the peak with a gaussian , a value of 0.11@xmath90.07 is obtained for the fwhm , compatible with the value obtained with rosat @xcite and chandra data @xcite",
    "pulse phase histograms were accumulated for each unit and for each observation of the pca independently for the 256 pha channels .",
    "the same procedure has been applied to mecs data .",
    "rxte response matrix were derived for each unit and summed together weighting with the background subtracted counts of the correspondent pcu s phase histograms .",
    "rxte spectra were combined by summing the individuals units and assigning a total exposure time equal to the sum of the individual exposures .",
    "the spectral distribution of the pulsed signal was accumulated in the phase interval 0.640.84 subtracting the off - pulse level evaluated in the phase range 0.00.5 .",
    "the two phase regions considered in our analysis are indicated in fig .",
    "2 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the bepposax and rxte spectra covering the energy range 1.030 kev were fitted together .",
    "the intercalibration factors were fixed to the values derived fitting the common energy interval 2 - 10 kev : in particular the value 0.9@xmath90.3 has been derived for lecs - mecs and 1.19@xmath90.09 for xte - mecs .",
    "the spectra have been modeled with a simple power law whose best fit parameters are shown in table 1 .",
    "the best fit parameters of the simple power law are in agreement with the previous evaluations @xcite and , according to the @xmath23 value , this model well represent the spectra over the whole range .",
    "the detected 210 unabsorbed flux is ( 7.3@xmath90.5)@xmath310@xmath10 erg @xmath11 s@xmath5 , corresponding to a uniform luminosity of 1.9@xmath310@xmath25 erg s@xmath5 for an estimate distance of 47 kpc @xcite .",
    "table 1 shows the best fit result .",
    "a second models have been investigated : a curved power law characterized by a linear dependence of the spectral slope upon the logarithm of energy :    @xmath26}\\ ] ]    this model has been used to fit the broad band pulsed spectra of the other crab - like pulsars crab @xcite , psr b1509 - 58@xcite psr b0540 - 69@xcite . the best fit result for this model",
    "is also shown in table 1 .",
    "the introduction of the curvature parameter @xmath27 however is significant at 99.7% confidence level computed with the f - test for the introduction of a single parameter . moreover",
    "the @xmath27 detected value is in agreement with the values obtained for the three other pulsars .",
    "we presented some preliminary results on the spectral and timing analysis of the x - ray pulsed emission of the 16 ms pulsar psr j0537@xmath06910 in the energy range 1.030 kev , based on archival bepposax and rossixte observations .",
    "the detected profile is characterized by a narrow single peak with a duty cycle of 0.28 at zero level .",
    "the pulsed spectrum has been fitted with two models : the simple power law and a curved power law .",
    "the simple power law gave acceptable @xmath23 , but the introduction of the curvature parameter @xmath27 is significant at 99.7% confidence level .",
    "this result suggests that the photon index softens at higher energies .",
    "the value of the bending parameters is compatible within the errors with the values find for the other crab - like pulsars crab @xcite , psr b1509 - 58 @xcite , psr b0540 - 69 @xcite . according to the measured parameters of the curved model , the sed of the pulsed emission have a maximum at the energy :",
    "the models that have been proposed to explain high energy emission from pulsars can be classified in two distinct classes , outer gap @xcite and polar gap models @xcite , depending on the location of the emitting region . in the framework of the outer gap model",
    ", the energy of the maximum follows the appropriate scaling relation with respect to the interpeak emission of the crab as observed for the psr b1509 - 58 @xcite .",
