    "potential energy landscape ( pel ) studies have contributed to the understanding of the dramatic slowing down of the dynamics of supercooled liquids near the glass transition temperature@xcite .",
    "the introduction of inherent structures ( is ) ( local minima of the pel ) @xcite , which divide the phase space into basins of attraction , allows the separation of vibrational motion from more fundamental structural transitions .",
    "it is thought that activation over barriers between inherent structures is the main mecanism of diffusion below the mode coupling transition temperature @xmath0 . above @xmath0  also saddles of the potential energy landscape play an important role in the diffusion properties of the system .",
    "the decrease of the number of saddles available to the system when the temperature is lowered towards @xmath0  has been proposed as one of the main reasons of the dramatic slowing down of the dynamics @xcite . in the framework of the landscape approach to the glass transition",
    "it has also been proposed that , at least for some glass formers , the landscape may be organized in @xmath1 that should contain many local minima where the system spends increasingly long times as temperature is lowered @xcite .",
    "however , the definition of metabasins is less rigorous than is and consequently even when the concept is not new only very recently quantitative results have begun to appear @xcite .    in a previous work we studied the statistics of distances in real space between neighbouring",
    "is @xcite in a binnary mixture lennard - jones glass and the number of saddles as function of temperature following molecular dynamics trajectories .",
    "we saw that the distance between minima decreases exponentially near @xmath0but does not go strictly to zero implying the existence of saddles even below @xmath0 .",
    "the number of saddles suffers a strong decrease around @xmath2 and decays abruptly at lower temperatures but stays finite near @xmath0 .",
    "these results together with the vanishing of the diffusivity at @xmath0   seem to imply the existence of saddles associated with nondiffusional events .",
    "the picture that emerges is one where the system spends long times in a kind of metabasins of the energy landscape each one of them containing many is similar to the one proposed by doliwa and heuer @xcite .    here",
    "we show that some dynamical quantities in two systems which have a similar kind of glass transition but posses very different pel structure behave in a qualitatively different way .",
    "this allows to distinguish the mechanisms of confinement in both kind of systems .",
    "we define time correlation functions between inherent structures visited during the equilibrium time evolution of a binary mixture lennard - jones glass .",
    "these correlations present two sharply distinguished time regimes which we show to correspond to exploration inside a basin of a particular is and to exploration of the neighborhood of a basin .",
    "the behaviour of the correlations as temperature is lowered towards @xmath0  implies the emergence of strong spatial confinement in configuration space . in order to test",
    "if these confinement is a consequence of the topology of the pel or if it can be explained as a purely dynamic effect we compare the behaviour of the lennard - jones glass with a model of traps where the landscape is flat and only confinement in time is present .",
    "in fact both systems behave qualitatively different implying that confinement in the lennard - jones glass is a consequence of the non trivial structure of the energy landscape .",
    "we discuss some possible scenarios for this structure which are compatible with the dynamical characteristics observed . while the existence of metabasins is a plausible scenario it is not the only possibility .    in section [ correlations ]",
    "we define the quantities of interest in our study . in section [ lj ]",
    "we show and discuss our results for the binary lennard - jones model . in section [ traps ]",
    "we show the corresponding results for a model of traps and finally in section [ final ] we present our conclusions .",
    "as mentioned above every instantaneous state of the system may be associated with an is of the energy landscape . given that at an initial time the system is in a configuration corresponding to some is , we define @xmath3 as the probability that the system _ is at the same _ is after a time @xmath4 .",
    "this means that the is associated with the inital and final states is the same irrespective of where the system was in between .",
    "we have observed that the is can be identified by their energy since the case of degeneracy ( interchange of two particles of the same kind , for example ) is quite unusual and has no significant statistical weight .",
    "so , the computation of @xmath3 is very simple : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the energy of the corresponding is at time @xmath7 and with the sum we perform an average over @xmath8 available times",
    ". it will be useful to study also another time correlation function , @xmath9 , given by the probability that the system _ has remained _ at the same inherent structure during a time @xmath4 . in this case",
    "@xmath10=1 only if @xmath11 for all @xmath12 .",
    "in fact , the calculation of @xmath9 involves an approximation due to the discretization of time .",
    "if the system goes to a neighbouring is and comes back within the interval @xmath13 our calculation wo nt notice it , so the calculated c@xmath14(t ) should be taken as an upper bound of the real one .",
    "other kinds of correlation functions between inherent structures have been already explored in the literature @xcite , although we prefer this new one which allows to illustrate clearly the connection with the topology of the landscape , as will be shown below .",
    "unfortunately these time correlation functions are size dependent . consider a system @xmath15 of @xmath16 particles compossed by two non - interacting subsystems @xmath17 and @xmath18 of @xmath19 and @xmath20 particles respectively . in this case",
    "@xmath21 , since the probability of coming back to a given state @xmath22 involves the two subsystems coming back to their respective states @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in the present work",
    "we study a system of @xmath25 particles at several temperatures . in order to study the size dependence of @xmath3 we performed also a simulation at @xmath26 for a system with @xmath27 particles .",

    "if the hypotesis of independence between subsystems holds for subsystems of size @xmath29 then it is easy to show that for @xmath30 : @xmath31^{\\frac{n}{n_1}}\\ ] ] in figure 1b we show that this equality is verified quite well for the systems studied .",
    "studying small systems is convinient because the decay of @xmath28 is slower for smaller n , an so one may access the long time behaviour of this correlation function .",
    "this fact has also been emphasized in other landscape studies of supercooled liquids @xcite .",
    "having shown that extrapolation to large systems is quite simple , in what follows we will study the properties of correlation functions for the @xmath25 system .",
    "it is important to note that , because of the size dependence , the relaxation times of these correlation functions can not be straightforwardly related to the typical time scales of the bulk relaxations in supercooled liquids .      here",

    "the value of beta is very small ( @xmath43 for @xmath44 ) and is decreasing sharply on approaching @xmath0 .",

    "we see that the str is the region of time where both correlation functions are almost equal .",
    "so the str of @xmath3 may be interpreted as the time the system remains at the same is while the ltr accounts for the time the system is @xmath50 one is , exploring neighbouring inherent structures and with a finite probability of coming back to the original is .",

    ", width=207,height=294 ]    in order to filter from the @xmath3 the effect of remaining in a single basin all the time , we show in figure [ dif ] the difference @xmath47 - @xmath48 which represents the probability of the system to be at the same is after a time @xmath4 _ knowing that it has gone away at least once during this time interval_. this probability shows two important characteristics : the first one is that there is a characteristic time at which the probability of coming back to the original is is maximal .",
    "this time scale grows when temperature is lowered : if the system goes out of a basin it takes more time to come back as temperature is lowered .",
    "the second feature is more important : the probability to come back * grows * as the glass transition temperature is approached .",
    "this is a signature of _ spatial confinement_. to show more clearly this point and closely inspect the relation between the studied correlation functions and landscape topology we study in the next section a random walker on a lattice with traps .",
    "the model of traps in a d - dimensional hypercubic lattice is realized as a random walk of a particle hopping between traps attached at each lattice site with a given trap energy distribution @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "depending on the form of the distribution different interesting dynamical behaviours are observed . if the energies are exponentially distributed the model has a dynamical phase transition at a finite temperature @xmath52 below which it presents typical glass phenomenology as aging effects .",
    "other possibilities like e.g. gaussian distribution of energies lead to a dynamical transition only at @xmath53 and show stretched exponential relaxations .",
    "the trap model has been proposed as a phenomenological or toy model for describing the physics of glasses and spin glasses . from a physical point of view",
    "the dynamics proceeds through activation over barriers corresponding to the depth of the traps . besides the difference in the depths",
    "the landscape can be considered flat , structureless .",
    "this is the essential point we want to compare with the lennard - jones glass which is known to possess a complex pel topology . in an interesting study denny",
    "et al.@xcite compared some properties of the lennard - jones glass with the model of traps .",
    "they found that there are collections of is of nearly the same energy which they associated with metabasins and present a nearly gaussian distribution of energies , similar to the distribution of single inherent structures energies .",
    "some relaxation functions do indeed behave in agreement with results on a model of traps , a result which implies that activated processes are important in the dynamics of the lj binary mixture also above the mode coupling transition temperature .    here",
    "we also make a comparison between the lennard - jones glass and the model of traps .",
    "but our aim here is to calculate the time correlation functions defined in section [ correlations ] for a simple model where the probability of the system to return to a given basin is exclusively of random character .",
    "so , we associate a trap to a basin ( not to a collection of basins like denny et al . did ) and study the probability that the system returns to a given basin .",
    "we considered two and three dimensional lattices , and assign to every site a trap of energy e that is determined randomly from an exponential distribution of the form @xmath54 .",
    "the energy associated to a given site is kept fixed during the simmulation , i.e. when the walker returns to a given site it finds the same trap ( quenched - disorder case@xcite ) . in order to make the comparison with the results for the binary lj model as closer as possible we choose the typical energy of the exponential distribution as @xmath52=@xmath0  ,",
    "so both models are expected to have a dynamical transition at the same temperature of @xmath0  = 0.435 .",
    "because of computational limitations periodic boundary conditions in a lattice of size @xmath55 are imposed to the values of the energies although the walker moves in an infinite lattice limited in practice only by the largest time considered in the correlation functions .",
    "we have used @xmath56 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 for @xmath59 . to obtain enough statistics at the lowest temperatures studied for @xmath59 we needed to perform",
    "rather long walks of @xmath60 steps that we averaged over 1000 realizations of disorder .",
    "we then computed the time correlation functions defined in [ correlations ] along these runs .",
    "in fact , because of the periodic boundary conditions imposed in the energies , in this case we use the position of a site instead of its energy in order to compute de delta function in expression [ eqcis ] . note that the function @xmath9 defined above corresponds exactly to the equilibrium correlation @xmath61 defined in equation ( 4 ) of @xcite .",
    "we verified that @xmath9  presents the expected long time behaviour at low temperatures : @xmath62 with @xmath63/@xmath0  , obtained theoretically by monthus _",
    "et al _ @xcite ( equation ( 14 ) ) .",
    "the difference @xmath47 - @xmath48 for the traps model in @xmath59 and @xmath57 and the same temperatures of figure [ dif ] .",
    ", width=207,height=294 ]    in figure [ trap ] we show the difference @xmath47 - @xmath48 for the traps model in two and three dimensions .",
    "the behaviour of these correlation functions as a function of temperature is qualitatively the same for d=2 and d=3 .",
    "they present a characteristic time that increases as temperature is lowered as we observed for the curves of figure 4 corresponding to the binary lj model . in the case of traps ,",
    "the maximum of the probability of coming back to a given trap moves towards increasing times as temperature is lowered because the walker is caught increasing times in the traps of the sorroundings .",
    "the confinement can only be attributed to the time the walker spends in the individual traps since every trap is spatially equivalent to each other , there is no spatial confinement as the walker moves in a flat landscape .",
    "more importantly , the fact that the height of the maximum of these curves increases for the binary lj model while it goes down for the traps - model is a clear indication that an adittional type of confinement exists in the energy landscape of the lj model .",
    "an arrangement of the energy landscape in metabasins that contain several basins ( as has been suggested by doliwa _",
    "@xcite ) could explain the qualitative features of the curves we observe in figure 4 since the system would be forced to explore several is within a metabasin before leaving it for a time that increases on approaching @xmath0 .",
    "but inspection of figure 5 suggest another possible picture for the topology of the energy landscape . from figure 5",
    "is clear that reduction of the dimention of the space where the walker moves increases sharply the absolute value of the studied probabilities .",
    "so , another possible mechanism that may account for the increasing confinement of the binary lj system is a reduction of dimensionality of the space where the system moves . in this picture , as temperature lowers , the system is forced to move in a landscape of reduced dimensionality where the different accesible regions of configuration space need not be sepparated by any energy barrier .",
    "in the present paper we defined time correlation functions between inherent structures of an energy landscape and study them for a lj binary mixture at different temperatures .",
    "we observed that the probability of being at the same is after a time @xmath4 , @xmath3 , presents two time regimes : a short time regime which is related to exploration of basins , and a long time regime which corresponds to exploration of the neighborhood of a given basin .",
    "the weak dependence of @xmath40 on temperature for the str at low temperatures indicates that the basin topology does nt change on approaching @xmath0 , while the contrary holds for the inter - basins topology given the strong variation of @xmath40 with @xmath42 in the ltr .",
    "the study of the difference @xmath64  for this system and comparison of the same function for a traps - model give clear evidence that in the lj model there is a spatial mechanism of confinement that is not present in the traps model . from our results",
    "two possible mechanisms emerge to account for the confinement at low temperatures .",
    "one possiblity is that inherent structures are arranged in superestructures like in the metabasins scenario@xcite .",
    "this scenario implies as a basic ingredient the existence of energy barriers , necessary to define the metabasins and consequently the landscape appears to be broken in pieces ( metabasins ) .",
    "nevertheless the confinement observed in our results can also be explained by a gradual reduction of the dimensionality accesible to the system as the temperature is lowered . in this second scenario ,",
    "as energy barriers are not implied a priori , the landscape is not necessarily broken in metabasins but its structure can be that of a network composed of connected funnels . in this scenario",
    "the confinement is consequence of a reduction of the dimension of the funnels as temperature is lowered .",
    "we have shown that the time correlation functions introduced in this paper are useful tools to get information on the structure of the pel in supercooled liquids and can also be straightforwardly calculated in trap like models .",
    "it would be interesting to analyze their behaviour in other models in which one could a priori define some structure or hierarquical organization of states which seems to be present in the lj binnary mixture ."
