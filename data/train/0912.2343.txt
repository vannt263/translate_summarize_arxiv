    "we again assume that the absorption at the systemic velocity produces a saturated gaussian absorption profile as in equation  [ eq.gaussian ] .",
    "we then further assume that there is additional emission on top of this continuum on the red side of each line with a gaussian profile .",

    "the velocity at the peak of the emission ( and the shape of the profile in general ) depends on a number of factors , e.g. ,  the outflow geometry and @xmath145 , and the velocity dispersion of the outflowing gas .",
    "our model can be written as follows :    @xmath176    where @xmath177 is emission in excess of the continuum and @xmath178 . we may then fit this model to the red sides of _ both _ lines in the doublet simultaneously ( where @xmath179 ) , in the velocity ranges @xmath180 and @xmath136 for the 2796   and 2803   lines , respectively .",
    "we subtract the fitted emission model ( @xmath177 ) from the coadd , divide out the model symmetric absorption , and measure the boxcar ew in the range @xmath141 for the resulting profile .",
    "because of the number of free parameters in this model ( 5 ) , this method does not generally produce acceptable fits for the coadded spectra in our study , as the results are often driven by noise features in the line profiles .",
    "however , the model does successfully characterize the red sides of the doublet lines in the much higher-@xmath93 coadds of w09 .",
    "we find that in the w09 coadds with the strongest emission features ( e.g. , the lowest- and middle-@xmath3 subsamples ) , the outflow ew we calculate using this method is @xmath181% lower than the outflow ew calculated in w09 ( and described above in  [ sec.decomp ] ) . in coadds such as the high-@xmath3 w09 subsample ,",
    "the difference in outflow ews calculated with the two methods is @xmath182% . while this model is quite simplistic ,",

    "there are two different physical mechanisms that may be responsible for driving these winds , which result in different dependencies of outflow properties on @xmath17 .",
    "one mechanism is the thermalization of energy from supernova ejecta , which generates a hot wind that entrains cold clouds in an outflow via ram pressure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "additionally , as described by @xcite and @xcite , in this energy - driven paradigm , the terminal velocity of cold clouds in the outflow is proportional to @xmath344 , where @xmath345 is the size of the starburst .    the other mechanism that may be important in driving winds is momentum from radiation pressure or cosmic ray pressure generated by a starburst or agn @xcite .",
    "in the case of radiation - driven outflow , the dependence of outflow velocity on starburst radius for an optically thick wind is slightly weaker , @xmath346 , while the criterion that must be met to drive a wind depends on the masses of the luminous star clusters driving the outflow .",

    "[ sec.disc_sfr_m ] , although we measure relatively high values of @xmath126 and outflow ew for our lowest-@xmath17 coadd ( with @xmath347 ) , because this spectrum has low @xmath93 , we consider the detection of outflow tentative , and it must be confirmed in future analyses . in the middle and high-@xmath17 subsamples ,",
    "the difference between outflow absorption measurements is significant only in the values of @xmath126 ; the outflow ew values are consistent within the errors .",
    "it is interesting , though at the limit of our data , to test whether the local criterion on @xmath17 for the driving of outflows also applies at @xmath12 . by accounting for a possible systematic underestimate of sfr by 0.21 dex ( see  [ sec.sfr ] ) , we have constructed a subsample with a @xmath17 that is likely to be under the local threshold in the mean .",
    "this coadd has @xmath240 , and yields an outflow ew @xmath162  .",
    "this value is suggestive of outflow , given the results of our analysis in ",
    "[ sec.sn ] , although the outflow absorption strength is not as large as in the high-@xmath3 and high-@xmath217 subsamples .",
    "however , given the _",
    "minimum _ estimated dispersion in our sfrs of 0.43 dex , this subsample may include some galaxies with @xmath187 .",
    "additionally , we have measured only a flux - averaged @xmath17 , with galaxy sizes parametrized by the half - light radius in the uv .",
    "starburst radii in the local universe are often constrained using half - light radii measured from uv or h@xmath15 imaging ; however , local and distant starbursts have been found to have distinct morphologies which may make measurements of half - light radii less appropriate for this purpose at @xmath12 .",
    "for instance , local lirgs commonly have centrally concentrated star formation @xcite , while lirgs at @xmath12 have more widely distributed star - forming knots @xcite .",
    "the half - light radius may therefore not be an accurate characterization of starburst radius in the distant universe , where it reflects the sizes of the distributions of star - forming knots in the objects , rather than the total surface area of the knots themselves .",
    "although we have not detected a strong dependence of outflow absorption strength on @xmath17 , we have by no means ruled it out , and future studies with higher @xmath93 spectra should include more detailed analyses of @xmath17 in distant galaxies .        we have identified evolutionary trends in outflow absorption strength which are dependent on galaxy @xmath3 . specifically , we have found that at @xmath348 , outflows are of comparable strength at @xmath349 and 1.4 . at lower @xmath3 , however , there is a significant decrease in outflow absorption strength with decreasing redshift along with a decrease in the sfr in the same galaxies .",
    "stated in another way , galaxies with similar sfrs at @xmath350 and 1.4 have similarly large outflow absorption strengths , while galaxies with @xmath351 ( @xmath352 ) do not appear to drive strong outflows .",
    "while these conclusions apply to galaxies in specific @xmath3 and @xmath217 ranges at different redshifts , they do not speak to the evolution of the outflow properties in a given galaxy through time .",
    "we now attempt to associate the tkrs galaxies with their progenitors in the w09 sample at @xmath4 by creating so - called  @xmath144 models \" to parametrize the evolution of sfr and @xmath3 in a given galaxy .",
    "we are largely motivated by the success of @xmath144 models in reproducing the distribution of galaxies in ssfr-@xmath3 space out to @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "these models are too simplistic to fully describe the evolution of an individual galaxy , which may experience starbursts , mergers , and other disturbances that define its star formation history .",

    "the tkrs galaxies , on the other hand , lie below the main sequence at @xmath12 .",
    "this discrepancy may be due to a number of factors .",
    "@xcite used a combination of @xmath210 and emission line luminosities to constrain the total extinction - corrected sfrs in their sample .",
    "we have shown that our uv - based sfrs are systematically lower ( by 0.21 dex ) than ir - based sfrs for galaxies with ir detections ; thus there may be a systematic offset between the sfrs in this work and in @xcite .",
    "in addition , we may have failed to remove some red , non - star - forming galaxies from the highest-@xmath3 subsample , which would reduce the median sfr in this bin .",
    "while the offset between the main sequence and our sample is as large as @xmath372 dex in ssfr for the highest-@xmath3 subsample , this discrepancy does not significantly affect our conclusions , discussed below .",

    "we next turn to the lower-@xmath3 subsamples .",
    "the high - ssfr galaxies in the middle-@xmath3 tkrs subsample lie close to the @xmath380 evolutionary track .",
    "there are w09 galaxies that lie along this track ( in the lowest- or middle-@xmath3 w09 subsample ) , which have ssfrs that may be consistent with progenitors of these high - ssfr tkrs galaxies , particularly if we consider that our ssfr values may be systematically low .",
    "that is , a @xmath144 model galaxy with @xmath380 and @xmath381 ( shown in blue ) may be included in the middle-@xmath3 w09 subsample when it is observed at @xmath378 and passes through the location of the middle-@xmath3 tkrs subsample at @xmath375 . in the case",

    "we find that the most massive , highest - sfr galaxies in the sample have a strong outflow absorption signature , while less massive ( @xmath393 , @xmath394 ) star - forming galaxies have no outflows or outflows with @xmath395 and with @xmath396 .",
    "these same low-@xmath3 galaxies have higher specific sfrs ( ssfr ) than the high-@xmath3 subsample , but lower absolute sfrs , suggesting that outflow absorption strength is more closely correlated with the latter .",

    "our comparison of the and line profiles in coadded spectra of high - sfr galaxies suggests that emission is a common feature of galaxies in this sample .",
    "although it remains unclear whether the absorption in this sample traces outflowing gas , by making the assumption that is indeed present in the same outflowing clouds that are traced by and that the @xmath145 is independent of outflow velocity , we use the lack of absorption blueward of @xmath398 to place an upper limit on the outflow column density at these velocities of @xmath399 .",
