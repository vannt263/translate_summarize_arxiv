    "in simplest terms , spiral galaxy disks can be described as geometrically thin , flat , and circular . we understand that spiral disks are geometrically thin because the gas of which they are composed is cold ( the sound speed of the gas is much smaller than its circular orbital velocity ) ; and they are both circular and flat because , being dissipative , the gas is fairly efficient at both minimizing out - of - the - plane motions and radial excursions that would lead to departures from circular orbits .",
    "describing spiral disks as _ perfectly _ circular and flat is clearly an oversimplification , however .",
    "in addition to the nonaxisymmetric structures that are obvious in optical photographs of many spiral disks , 21-cm maps of the projected velocity fields of spiral disks often reveal isovelocity contours that are significantly twisted ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , 1980b ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "kinematical tilted - ring models have been constructed in an effort to explain the presence of such twists in the velocity maps of disks .",
    "the models indicate that the outer regions of many normal spiral disks are significantly warped out of the principal plane that is defined by the optically visible , central portion of each galaxy .",
    "the line of nodes that defines the intersection of adjacent rings of gas in these kinematical models also usually must be twisted significantly as a function of radius in order to explain the observed contour maps ( for recent reviews , see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter ctsc ) .",
    "it is not particularly surprising that many galaxies are observed to possess extended , rotationally flattened disks because such structures appear to be fairly ubiquitous in gravitationally bound , astrophysical systems .",
    "( there is strong evidence , for example , that rotationally flattened disks either exist now or have existed in the past around our sun , individual planets within our solar system , numerous protostars , the primary star of many mass  exchanging binary star systems , and active galactic nuclei . )",
    "what is peculiar about the disks of many galaxies is that the disks are significantly warped .",
    "it is not clear why natural dissipative processes similar to those which work effectively to minimize out - of - the - plane motions in stellar or protostellar `` accretion '' disks are unable to suppress warps in the gaseous disks of galaxies . as binney ( 1992 )",
    "has reviewed , there still is no generally accepted dynamical model of spiral galaxies that satisfactorily explains either the origin or the current structure of warped disks .",
    "almost thirty years ago , hunter & toomre ( 1969 ) examined whether normal , infinitesimal bending oscillations might be exhibited by thin , rotating disks of self - gravitating material , permitting them to sustain coherent warps for more than a hubble time .",
    "they concluded that `` for any disk whose density tapers sufficiently gradually to zero near its edge , '' the frequency spectrum of such oscillations is at least partly continuous and , as a result , coherent warps can not be sustained .",
    "over the subsequent decade , a number of other ideas surfaced to explain the persistence of warps in galaxies , each one taking advantage of the demonstrated existence of dark matter halos around galaxies .",
    "as toomre ( 1983 ) has reviewed , however , models proposing to use the halo as an active agent to excite warps in otherwise flat disks  for example , via the mathieu instability ( binney 1981 ) or via a flapping instability ( bertin & mark 1980 )  each present significant difficulties . toomre ( 1983 ) and dekel & shlosman ( 1983 ) proposed , instead , that untwisted steady - state warps may be sustained as a result of steady forcing by a nonspherical , tilted halo .",
    "building on the early work of hunter & toomre ( 1969 ) and the idea that forcing by a nonspherical dark halo can influence the dynamics of the visible disks of galaxies , sparke ( 1986 ) and sparke & casertano ( 1988 ) have shown that a discrete warping mode can persist if the disk is sufficiently self - gravitating and if it is embedded in a nonspherical halo whose equatorial plane is tilted with respect to the centralmost regions of the disk .    adopting this model of galaxy warps ,",
    "the following evolutionary picture emerges . during the galaxy formation process , gas which falls into a spheroidal dark matter halo",
    "generally will find that its angular momentum vector is tipped at some nonzero angle , @xmath0 , away from the symmetry axis of the halo .",
    "if the gas is cold , it will settle into a rotationally flattened disk that is tilted at the same angle @xmath0 with respect to the equatorial plane of the halo . in the centralmost regions of the galaxy , where the self - gravity of the gas ( or , ultimately , the combined gas / star system ) dominates over the gravitational influence of the halo , the gas will be content to remain in orbits that preserve this original tilt . in the outermost regions of the galaxy",
    "where the gravitational field of the halo dominates , however , the gas should settle into the halo s equatorial plane .",
    "as toomre ( 1983 ) and dekel & shlosman ( 1983 ) both sketched in their original concept papers , there also should be an intermediate region where the gas will be influenced significantly by the nonspherical gravitational fields of both the halo and the central gas ( or gas / star ) disk .    through their modeling efforts , sparke ( 1986 ) and sparke & casertano ( 1988 ) confirmed this earlier suspicion that in the intermediate region , the gas can reside in a steady - state , `` warped disk '' structure that provides a smooth radial transition between the separate `` flat disk '' orientations of the inner and outer regions of the galaxy . concentrating on the dynamics of the centralmost and intermediate regions  that is , by building models in which there was effectively no gas in the outermost regions ",
    "sparke & casertano ( 1988 ) showed that , in steady - state , the warped disk exhibits a straight line of nodes which precesses slowly and coherently in a direction retrograde to the orbital motion of the gas . in a time - dependent simulation , furthermore , hofner & sparke ( 1994 ) showed that settling to this steady - state warped disk structure occurs from the inside , out , and is driven not by dissipative processes that are similar to those which are thought to drive settling in most stellar or protostellar accretion disks but , rather , because `` bending waves carry energy associated with transient disturbances out toward the disk edge . ''",
    "they also showed that , during an evolution as the bending waves propagate outward through the intermediate region of the disk , a twisted structure can develop and persist until the gas has had sufficient time to settle into the steady - state ( constant line of nodes ) configuration .",
    "sparke & casertano ( 1988 ) and hofner & sparke ( 1994 ) have demonstrated that , with an appropriate choice of parameters , this model of disk warping matches well the observed properties of several galaxies with warped disks .",
    "( see also kuijken 1991 and dubinski & kuijken 1995 . )    as hofner & sparke ( 1994 ) have pointed out , in galaxies with extended disks `` the outermost gas can not be expected to form part of a coherent warping mode .",
    "'' they did not include normal dissipative forces in their simulations and therefore were unable to comment on how such forces might influence the settling process . in this paper",
    ", we examine the disk - settling process from the other extreme , ignoring the self - gravity of the gas but introducing an effective kinematical viscosity into the dynamical equations in order to simulate the effects of dissipative forces . hence",
    ", our effort is complementary to the work of hofner & sparke ( 1994 ) and is most relevant to galaxies with extended disks  although there is one galaxy used for model comparisons ( ngc 2841 ) that is shared by both works .",
    "we adopt the view that warps in extended disks which exhibit substantial twists are transient features .",
    "independent of precisely what physical process was responsible for initially placing the gas in an orbit that is inclined to the halo s equatorial plane ( _ e.g. _ , gas infall at the time of formation or a recent tidal encounter with another galaxy ) , the twisted structure can be understood as the result of differential precession in the gaseous disk as it dissipatively settles toward that `` preferred plane . ''    in the past , there has been considerable concern ( first enunciated by kahn & woltjer [ 1959 ] , but reiterated in the reviews by both toomre [ 1983 ] and binney [ 1991 ] ) that differential precession will destroy any warped disk structure on a time scale that is short compared to a hubble time and , therefore , that the mechanism we are examining can not reasonably be used to explain the persistence of such structures . in the outermost regions of disks , however , precession times are relatively long and , as was first pointed out by tubbs & sanders ( 1979 ) , a warped gas layer can persist for a hubble time if the dark halo in which the disk is embedded deviates only slightly from spherical symmetry . by modeling carefully the process of disk settling that is driven by normal dissipative forces and comparing the models to the observed kinematical properties of galaxies with extended , warped layers , we hope to be able to more carefully examine the viability of such models .",
    "steiman - cameron & durisen ( 1988 , hereafter scd88 ) have developed this idea rather extensively .",
    "they have adopted a numerical , cloud - fluid model to simulate the time - dependent evolution of a galaxy disk that intially is tilted out of the equatorial plane of an underlying , spheroidal dark halo .",
    "the disk is assumed to be composed of a set of annular mass elements , or `` clouds , '' which act like atoms in a viscous fluid .",
    "the scd88 model has offered some valuable physical insight into the time - dependent settling process that is driven by normal dissipative forces and their dynamically generated model of a twisted galaxy disk has been surprisingly successful at matching the peculiar optical image of one particular galaxy , ngc 4753 ( @xcite ) .",
    "our model is analogous to the one developed by scd88 but it derives from an analytical prescription of the viscous settling process .",
    "more specifically , we employ the `` twisted - disk '' equation formalism first developed by bardeen & petterson ( 1975 ) and petterson ( 1977 , 1978 ) to describe the time - dependent settling of a thin , viscous disk in a nonspherical dark halo potential .",
    "this is a rather natural formalism to adopt because , as numerous kinematical `` tilted - ring '' models have demonstrated , warped galaxy disks display a structure that resembles , at least qualitatively , the twisted geometry that had once been thought to be important in accretion disks which surround certain compact stellar objects ( bardeen & petterson 1975 ; see a recent rejuvenation of this idea put forward by maloney & begelman 1997 ) . in adapting the model to galaxy disks ,",
    "we have replaced the approximate keplerian gravitational potential used in earlier accretion disk work with a logarithmic potential appropriate to galaxy halos .",
    "( pringle [ 1992 ] also recently described how the twisted  disk formalism may be adapted to galaxies . ) in the limit of stress - free precession , our model reproduces the analytical prescription of disk settling first presented by scd88 , but our model is not constrained to this limit .",
    "a more general solution to the governing equations predicts an exponential settling rate that depends on time to the first power , rather than on time to the third power as has been derived in the limit of stress - free precession .",
    "furthermore , an analytical , steady - state solution to the governing equations produces a twisted - disk structure that is very similar to previously constructed , kinematical models .",
    "we demonstrate that projected surface density maps and radial velocity maps derived from our analytical model match published maps of five well - studied warped disk galaxies ( m83 , ngc 300 , ngc 2841 , ngc 5033 , and ngc 5055 ) very well .",
    "bardeen & petterson ( 1975 ) and petterson ( 1978 ) have written the hydrodynamic equations determining the structure and evolution of nonplanar , thin accretion disks in a `` twisted - coordinate system . '' in this system , the position @xmath1 on each ring of radius @xmath2 is referenced to a local cylindrical coordinate frame @xmath3 which has been rotated with respect to the cartesian coordinate system of the central reference ring by the two orientation angles @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "for an appropriate choice of the two functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 , including specifically the assumption that @xmath8 , the equations separate into a set of the usual hydrodynamic equations for a flat disk and a pair of coupled `` twist - equations '' governing the orientation of the disk . because of its ability to describe an apparently complicated , fully three - dimensional dynamical problem with a relatively simple and elegant mathematical model , a number of different groups have subsequently also adopted this formalism . however , until recently there has been some disagreement over what terms may be dropped from the fully three - dimensional , nonlinear partial differential equations ( due to their `` smallness '' relative to other terms ) when deriving the governing twist - equations .",
    "( for a complete discussion of the various simplifications and assumptions made in deriving this formalism see petterson [ 1978 , 1979 ] ; hatchett , begelman , & sarazin [ 1981 ] ; and papaloizou & pringle [ 1983 ] . ) as the following brief review points out , the disagreements have not been over the general _ form _ of the equations but , rather , over the precise value of certain order - unity coefficients . ultimately ,",
    "as explained below , we have adopted the derivation presented by papaloizou & pringle ( 1983 ) .    according to petterson ( 1978 ) , the twist - equations take the following form : @xmath9\\ ; c_1\\frac{\\beta^\\prime}{r}-\\gamma^{\\prime2}\\beta\\biggr]\\ ; + \\;\\frac{1}{2\\pi   v_{\\psi}}\\int_0^{2\\pi } f_{t}\\cos\\psi\\,d\\psi , \\nonumber   \\\\ \\\\   \\dot \\gamma+v_{r}\\gamma^\\prime&= & \\frac{\\nu}{2}c_0 \\biggl[\\gamma^{\\prime\\prime}+",
    "c_1\\frac{\\gamma^\\prime}{r}+ \\frac{2\\gamma^\\prime\\beta^\\prime}{\\beta}\\biggr ] \\;+\\;\\frac{1}{2\\pi\\beta v_{\\psi}}\\int_0^{2\\pi } f_{t}\\sin\\psi\\,d\\psi,\\nonumber \\label{p78teqs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in these expressions , dots and primes denote differentiation with respect to time and space , respectively , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the radial and azimuthal components of the fluid velocity , @xmath14 is the vertically averaged kinematical viscosity , and @xmath15 is an externally supplied `` twisting force '' .",
    "hatchett , begelman , & sarazin ( 1981 , hereafter hbs ) pointed out some inconsistencies between petterson s ( 1978 ) derivation and the earlier presentation by bardeen & petterson ( 1975 ) . through an independent derivation",
    ", they determined that the twist - equations do take the form of equation ( 1 ) , but they concluded that the two coefficients should have the values @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "most significantly , hbs showed that the pair of twist - equations can be written as a single , _",
    "complex _ twist - equation of the form @xmath18 where the complex variable _ w _ is defined in terms of the angles @xmath5 and @xmath4 as @xmath19 and @xmath20}\\,d\\psi\\;. \\label{ldef}\\ ] ] written in this form , the twist - equation readily submits to analytical solution for certain driving forces .",
    "papaloizou and pringle ( 1983 , hereafter pp ) have suggested that the hbs derivation also has shortcomings ( for example , as viscous evolution occurs according to the hbs equations , angular momentum does not appear to be conserved globally ) .",
    "they have derived a set of twist - equations that more consistently ties in with traditional @xmath21-disk models and have demonstrated explicitly that their derived equations conserve angular momentum .",
    "as can most easily be deduced from the presentations of kumar & pringle ( 1985 ) and pringle ( 1992 ) , for a disk whose inner radius goes to zero and whose surface density is independent of radius , the pp derivation also leads to a complex twist - equation that takes the form of equation ( [ hbsteq ] ) . however , adopting pp s `` naive approach '' in order to gain physical insight into the nature of the problem ( i.e. , setting kumar and pringle s function @xmath22 ) , one concludes from these three papers that the proper coefficients are : @xmath23 @xmath24 ,   \\eqnum{5b } \\label{ppcoefs}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 for a keplerian disk @xmath26 ; therefore , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . interestingly , these are the same coefficients that appear in bardeen & petterson s ( 1975 ) earliest presentation of the twist equations .",
    "henceforth , we will adopt and build upon the twist - equations derived by pp because it is clear that in a viscous disk evolution that is governed by the pp twist - equations , angular momentum is conserved .",
    "petterson ( 1978 ) , hbs , and pp each used an approximately keplerian potential to represent the underlying gravitational potential well that governs disk dynamics . while the keplerian potential correctly describes the gravitational field in which a thin accretion disk surrounding a compact object sits , it is inappropriate for a thin galaxy disk sitting in the potential well of a nonspherical dark - matter halo . utilizing kumar & pringle s ( 1985 ) and pringle s ( 1992 ) extensions of the pp derivation ,",
    "it is possible to generalize the complex twist - equation to incorporate an arbitrary power - law form for the gravitational potential .",
    "specifically , adopting a rotation law of the form @xmath29 expression ( [ ppcoefs ] ) becomes @xmath30.\\ ] ] furthermore , as petterson ( 1978 ) has pointed out , the radial velocity can be expressed in terms of the vertically averaged kinematical viscosity as    @xmath31    employing our generalized rotation law , we therefore can write @xmath32 using this expression in conjunction with equations ( 5a ) and ( 7 ) , the complex twist - equation ( 2 ) takes the form : @xmath33 + i{\\it l}\\;. \\label{btfteq1}\\ ] ]",
    "as outlined in @xmath34 1 , our objective is to examine the evolution of a cold gaseous disk that is embedded in a spheroidal , dark halo potential . in general , we assume that when the gas is initially introduced into the halo potential well , the orientation of its angular momentum vector is not aligned with the symmetry axis of the halo . because the halo is not spherically symmetric , the halo s gravitational field will exert a finite `` twisting force '' on the gaseous disk ; in simplest terms , this field forces rings of gas at different radii to precess about the symmetry axis ( or symmetry plane ) of the halo .    in the present context , a spheroidal dark - matter halo can be satisfactorily represented by a scale - free logarithmic potential ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite , 1990 ) .",
    "this potential is a useful approximation because a circular disk orbiting inside such a potential will exhibit a flat rotation curve ( i.e. , @xmath35 and @xmath13 is independent of radius ) , as seen in real galaxies . in a halo potential of this type ,",
    "the precession frequency about the symmetry axis of the potential @xmath36 is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a constant which measures the strength of the quadrupole distortion of the halo and the minus ( plus ) sign indicates that the spheriodal halo is oblate ( prolate ) .    for a twisted disk embedded in a spheroidal potential well , the twisting force that enters",
    "the derived twist equation assumes precisely the same algebraic form as the twisting force that bardeen & petterson ( 1975 ) used when modeling the evolution of a disk orbiting a nonspherical , compact stellar object , namely , @xmath39 hence , from equation ( [ ldef ] ) , @xmath40 and we deduce that the evolution of a thin galaxy disk in a scale - free logarithmic halo potential can be described by the expression @xmath41",

    "this will give us additional confidence that ( [ btfteq3 ] ) offers a valid description of the dynamics of a twisted galaxy disk .",
    "we present , first , the limit of viscous - free precession , then the limit of stress - free precession .      in the limit where viscous effects are completely negligible",
    ", @xmath44 and equation ( [ btfteq3 ] ) reduces to the case of free precession , @xmath45 with no associated evolutionary damping of orbit inclinations , that is , @xmath46 equation ( 15a ) can be integrated to give @xmath47 where @xmath48 prescribes the twisting of the disk at time @xmath49 .      if the viscous stresses due to twisting have negligible effect on differential precession during the settling process  a condition that scd88 refer to as `` stress - free precession '' ",
    "one may set @xmath50 in the governing , complex twist - equation . under this condition ,",
    "equation ( [ btfteq3 ] ) predicts the following evolutionary behavior : @xmath51 @xmath52 this pair of equations matches equations [ 37a ] and [ 37b ] of scd88 except that the first term on the rhs of equation [ 17a ] is a factor of 2 larger than the equivalent term in equation [ 37b ] of scd88 .",
    "we suspect that the scd88 result is in error , but we have been unable to identify where scd88 dropped the factor of 2 because their published derivation was not sufficiently clear .    if we furthermore adopt the `` stress - free '' precession condition introduced by scd88 , the first term in equation ( 17a ) is set to zero ( hence the discrepant factor of 2 is not an issue ) and the equation reduces to the form of equation ( 15a )  hence , @xmath53 with @xmath54 , equation ( 17b ) specifically integrates to give @xmath55\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath56^{-\\frac{1}{3}}\\;,\\ ] ] and @xmath57 is the value of the inclination at @xmath49 . hence the analytical settling model presented by scd88",

    "it is not at all clear how widely applicable the scd88 analytical settling model is to the warped disks of normal spiral galaxies because the simplifying assumptions ( e.g. , @xmath58 ) are quite limiting .",
    "however , with the analytical twist - equation in hand , we can perform a less restrictive examination of such systems .",
    "we begin by rewriting equation ( [ btfteq3 ] ) in the form @xmath59 where derivatives are now taken with respect to the dimensionless time and space variables @xmath60 and @xmath61 if we assume that the spatial and temporal parts of the complex angle @xmath62 are separable , i.e. , @xmath63 then @xmath64,\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is in general complex , and @xmath66 must be a solution of @xmath67 the above equation can be transformed by the substitutions @xmath68 and @xmath69 , into a form which shows its relationship to bessel s equation @xmath70 the character of the solutions and the spectrum of @xmath65 are determined by boundary conditions , but some general comments can be made without reference to specific boundary conditions or initial state . the fact that one can do so is important here since we do not have a well - posed problem in which we know the initial state and the relevant boundary conditions . for each @xmath65",
    "there is a radius @xmath71 inside which the third term inside the parantheses in equation ( 27 ) may be neglected . in this region",
    "the solution behaves as @xmath72 .",
    "we rule out @xmath73 because it is not finite at the origin ( abramowicz & stegun 1972 ) whereas for plausible initial states @xmath62 must be finite everywhere . in general , the spectrum of @xmath65 may contain both growing and decaying modes .",
    "we do not consider growing modes since their presence would indicate instability .",
    "the fact that one can fit a number of observational cases with the simpler solution in which only decaying modes are present may be considered a justification _ a posteriori _ of this assumption . in any case , it is clear that if an arbitrary initial state can be written as a superposition containing many values of @xmath65 satisfying appropriate boundary conditions , the behaviour in the central region will approach the solution with @xmath74 .",
    "this tendency manifests itself as a function of time first near the center and later further out as any contribution with large @xmath75 dies away rapidly .",
    "since the solution with @xmath74 is formally the steady  state solution , we would expect it to apply more or less universally to the interior regions of twisted disks , no matter what the initial conditions were .",

    "the steady - state solution just derived is formally inappropriate for real galaxies especially because the outermost regions of real galaxy disks are unlikely to be described well by time - independent conditions .",
    "however , over the ( innermost ) regions of a galaxy disk where differential precession and viscous dissipation have been able to effect appreciable settling in a hubble time , we expect the spatial structure of the disk to assume a form that is very similar to the one portrayed by the function @xmath103 .",

    "when comparing our model to the properties of real galaxy disks , we will treat @xmath107 as a free parameter that measures the overall amplitude of a galaxy s warp and not be immediately concerned about the values of @xmath57 , @xmath106 , or the age of each disk .",
    "the other free parameter that may be adjusted before our twisted disk model is compared to real galaxy disks is @xmath108 , the radial cutoff to the function @xmath103 that will correspond to the maximum radial extent @xmath109 of a galaxy s disk . although @xmath109 can be specified for individual galaxies ( see table 1 ) , the length scale @xmath110 as defined in equation ( [ dimr ] ) can not be specified _ a priori _ because neither of the physical parameters @xmath14 or @xmath38 is known for individual galaxies . hence , initially it was unclear to us what cutoff radius @xmath111 ( _ i.e. _ , what range @xmath112 ) should be adopted for our model .",

    "in order to make the relevant comparisons , the observational maps have been rotated counterclockwise approximately @xmath142 in order to properly orient them with respect to our model images .",
    "notice that after this rotation has been made , our 3d rendered image of ngc300 closely resembles the perspective drawing of rcc s tilted - ring model ( see their fig .",
    "notice , first , that the velocity contour image of our model of ngc 300 closely resembles rcc s published velocity map .",
    "in addition , our surface - brightness map displays a pair of faint , `` leading spiral '' arms that touch the left and right edges of the image shown in fig .",
    "we believe that these arms provide an explanation for the faint features that extend to the northwest and , particularly , southeast regions of the rcc map .",
    "the model that was used to generate images for fig .  3 was constructed assuming that the precessional frequency @xmath36 was negative ( see eq .",
    "that is , the underlying halo was assumed to be _ oblate _ in shape and accordingly , the precessional motions retrograde with respect to the orbital motion of the gas . because the magnitude of the precessional frequency _ decreases _ with increasing radius in each disk , retrograde precession results in a physical twist that has a `` leading '' appearance in the 3d , rendered image of each system .",
    "( in contrast , optically visible spiral arms are generally thought to be `` trailing '' features . ) knowing this , one can discern whether the angular momentum vector of each galaxy is pointing into ( out of ) the page by simply noticing whether the warped structure exhibits an overall clockwise ( counterclockwise ) twist .",
    "as ctsc pointed out , an identically good fit to the maps can be obtained with a disk that exhibits a retrograde twist ( i.e. , one that settles into a prolate spheroidal halo ) as with a disk that exhibits a prograde twist .",
    "after switching the sign of @xmath143 in eq .",
    "( 11 ) to reverse the sense of the twisting in the 3d model , one need only adjust one s line - of - sight viewing angle according to the prescription @xmath144 in order to generate projected velocity and surface - density maps from a `` prolate '' model that are identical to the maps generated from and `` oblate '' model . fig .",
    "5b illustrates what the `` prolate '' model for ngc 5033 looks like once this transformation is employed .",
    "if two quite different 3d disk structures ( one with a prograde twist and one with a retrograde twist ) can generate identical 2d maps when projected onto the sky , how can one decipher which offers the physically more realistic model ?",
    "as ctsc pointed out , information gleaned from optical photographs can often provide the supplementary information that is needed to identify which model is more realistic .",
    "for example , one must insist that the angular momentum vector of m83 points away from the observer ( _ into _ the page on fig .",
    "3 ) if its optical spiral arms are to be interpreted as _ trailing _ features ; hence a warped disk model with a prograde twist ( and settling in an _ oblate _ spheriodal halo ) as illustrated in fig .",
    "3 is the preferred solution .",
    "similar arguments ( or ones based on dust obscuration ) lead one to conclude that the disks of ngc 2841 , ngc 5055 , and ngc 300 are also settling in oblate spheriodal halos . however , for ngc 5033 , the retrograde twisting ( prolate spheriodal halo ) model is clearly preferrable to the prograde twisting model .",
    "this statement is supported by two arguments : first , dust obscuration in an optical photograph of ngc 5033 ( cf .",
    "4a of ctsc and panel 127 of sandage & bedke 1994 ) identifies the western edge of the galaxy as nearer to the observer than its eastern edge ; second , model 5b must be chosen over 5a if the optical spiral arms are to be interpreted as trailing features .",
    "hence , the 3d image of ngc 5033 shown in fig .",
    "5b is the correct depiction of the galaxy as inferred from our model fitting .",
    "it should be noted that the animation sequence from which the frames shown in fig .  3 were selected was originally constructed with the expressed intention of flying through lines of sight that we previously had determined would produce good fits to m83 , ngc 5033 and ngc 300 ; the only intrinsic model parameter that was adjusted during the fly - by sequence was the overall warp amplitude @xmath107 . during our viewing of the fly - by sequence , we also spotted images that matched the published observational maps of ngc 2841 and ngc 5055 .",
    "the frames presented in fig .",
    "3 have been taken directly from the original animation sequence ; absolutely no attempt has been made to fine - tune the model parameters to fit these two additional galaxies separately . clearly , then",
    ", it is primarily the line - of - sight viewing angle to each disk and not the parameters defining the underlying structural properties of each disk that had to be adjusted from galaxy to galaxy in order to match the observations .",
    "considering its simplicity  in particular , the significantly reduced number of free parameters as compared to previous tilted - ring models  the agreement between the projected maps of our model and observed maps is excellent .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the function @xmath103 and the corresponding expressions for @xmath93 and @xmath94 given by eqs .",
    "( 36a ) and ( 36b ) provide a good template for matching the observed kinematical structure of disks . because a single value of the parameter @xmath111 and little variation in the parameter @xmath107 are required to achieve a good model fit to five separate galaxies ,",
    "we conclude that these five systems intrinsically have very similar warped disk structures .",
    "most importantly , however , since the function @xmath103 derives from a physically reasonable dynamical picture of disk settling , there is an expectation that our model provides insight into the underlying physical properties of these systems .",
    "for example , since @xmath117 for each galaxy , we conclude from definition ( [ dimr ] ) that in each galaxy , the ratio @xmath145 where @xmath109 is the outer radius of the observed disk .",
    "( table 1 shows the values of @xmath146 calculated individually for each modeled system . )",
    "also , if our model is relevant at all , the existence of each warped layer indicates that viscous settling has been effective in a hubble time ( @xmath147 ) and @xmath148 . without a proper understanding of the boundary conditions , we are unable to determine the correct physical value of @xmath106 . assuming for the moment that @xmath149 and setting @xmath150 , we conclude from definition ( [ dimt ] ) that @xmath151 these two ratios can only hold if , in each system , @xmath152 and @xmath153 it is worth noting that the values obtained for @xmath14 in all cases ( see table 1 ) are consistent with a rough estimate of the viscosity due to dissipational cloud  cloud collisions in the solar neighborhood where @xmath154 km / s kpc ( lynden - bell & pringle 1974 ) .",
    "very modest variations in cloud dimensions , r.m.s . velocity and filling factor from galaxy to galaxy",
    "are sufficient to reproduce the range of values shown on table 1 .",
    "the fact that reasonable viscosity estimates are obtained by assuming @xmath155 may be considered as a posteriori justification for our choice .",
    "utilizing the formalism originally introduced by petterson to describe warped and twisted accretion disk structures in keplerian potentials , we have derived a single , complex ode to describe time dependent settling of an disk in the logarithmic potential that appears to be typical of normal spiral galaxies . over the interval @xmath100 , the analytical function @xmath103  derived from an analysis of the steady - state limit of the general twisted - disk equation  appears to describe quite accurately the general warped and twisted structure that is exhibited by a number of galaxy disks .",
    "it should be noted again that our analysis is based on the assumption that the warping angle @xmath5 is @xmath156 . for galaxies with larger warps ( including some that we have modeled )",
    "this is a simplifying assumption and should be disregarded in more proper treatments ( see pringle [ 1992 ] ) .    from our model",
    "fits we conclude that , quite generally , the effective kinematical viscosity in these neutral hydrogen disks is @xmath157 km s@xmath158 kpc .",
    "that is , the effective reynolds number in these systems is @xmath159 according to equation ( [ radvsub ] ) , this also implies that the ratio of the radial inflow velocity of the gas to its orbital velocity is @xmath160    this model also provides a mechanism by which the parameter @xmath38  the quadrupole moment of the underlying dark halo potential well  can be measured in spiral galaxies .",
    "our fits to five normal spirals with well - studied warped disks specifically indicate that @xmath161 .",
    "( this value can be increased to @xmath162 , with a corresponding factor of ten increase in viscosity , only if the age of these disks is assumed to be 0.1@xmath163  which seems unlikely  or @xmath106 in expression 38c is found to be @xmath164 . )",
    "hence , we conclude that the dark halos in which these warped disks sit are , to quite high accuracy , spherically symmetric",
    ". this particular conclusion should not come as a surprise because some time ago tubbs and sanders ( 1979 ) pointed out that if warped disks are identified as transient structures , the warp can only be sustained for a hubble time if the underlying halo potential is very nearly spherical .",
    "although we have examined in detail here only the steady - state solution , the derived time - dependent twisted - disk equation provides a tool that can be utilized to model the time - evolution of warped disks without resorting to elaborate numerical techniques .    the twisted - disk formalism in general  and the analytical function @xmath103 in particular  provides an avenue through which models of warped disks can advance from purely kinematical fits ( e.g. tilted - ring models ) to dynamical models based on a reasonable physical model .",
    "in the future , we also expect to use the time - dependent form of the twisted - disk equations as a point of comparison for fully three - dimensional gas dynamic simulations of disks settling into distorted halo potentials .",
