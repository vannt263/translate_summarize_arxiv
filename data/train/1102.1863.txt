    "in ref .  @xcite an @xmath7 conformally symmetric model was proposed for strong interactions at low energies , based on the observation , published in 1919 by h.  weyl in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the dynamical equations of gauge theories retain their flat - space - time form when subject to a conformally - flat metrical field , instead of the usual minkowski background .",
    "confinement of quarks and gluons is then described through the introduction of two scalar fields which spontaneously break the @xmath7 symmetry down to @xmath8 and @xmath9 symmetry , respectively . moreover ,",
    "a symmetric second - order tensor field is defined that serves as the metric for flat space - time , coupling to electromagnetism .",
    "quarks and gluons , which to lowest order do not couple to this tensor field , are confined to an anti - de - sitter ( ads ) universe @xcite , having a finite radius in the flat space - time .",
    "this way , the model describes quarks and gluons that oscillate with a universal frequency , independent of the flavor mass , inside a closed universe , as well as photons which freely travel through flat space - time .    the fields in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite comprise one real scalar field @xmath10 and one complex scalar field @xmath11 .",
    "their dynamical equations were solved in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case that the respective vacuum expectation values , given by @xmath12 and @xmath13 , satisfy the relation @xmath14 a solution for @xmath12 of particular interest leads to ads confinement , via the associated conformally flat metric given by @xmath15 .    the only quadratic term in the lagrangian of ref .  @xcite is proportional to @xmath16 hence , under the condition of relation ( [ slvacua ] ) , one obtains , after choosing vacuum expectation values , a light @xmath10 field , associated with confinement , and a very heavy complex @xmath11 field , associated with electromagnetism .",
    "weak interactions were not contemplated in ref .",
    "@xcite , but one may read electroweak for electromagnetism . here , we will study the  supposedly light  mass of the scalar field that gives rise to confinement .    the conformally symmetric model of ref .",
    "@xcite in itself does not easily allow for interactions between hadrons , as each hadron is described by a closed universe .",
    "hence , in order to compare the properties of this model with the actually measured cross sections and branching ratios , the model has been further simplified , such that only its main property survives , namely its flavor - independent oscillations . this way the full ads spectrum is , via light - quark - pair creation , coupled to the channels of two  or more  hadronic decay products for which scattering amplitudes can be measured .",
    "the ads spectrum reveals itself through the structures observed in hadronic mass distributions .",
    "however , as we have shown in the past ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , there exists no simple relation between enhancements in the experimental cross sections and the ads spectrum .",
    "it had been studied in parallel , for mesons , in a coupled - channel model in which quarks are confined by a flavor - independent harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "empirically , based on numerous data on mesonic resonances measured by a large variety of experimental collaborations , it was found @xcite that an ads oscillation frequency of @xmath17 agrees well with the observed results for meson - meson scattering and meson - pair production in the light @xcite , heavy - light @xcite , and heavy @xcite flavor sectors , thus reinforcing the strategy proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another ingredient of the model for the description of non - exotic quarkonia , namely the coupling of quark - antiquark components to real and virtual two - meson decay channels @xcite via @xmath18 quark - pair creation , gives us a clue about the size of the mass of the @xmath10 field .",
    "for such a coupling it was found that the average radius @xmath19 for light - quark - pair creation in quarkonia could be described by an flavor - independent mass scale , given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the effective reduced quarkonium mass . in earlier work ,",
    "the value @xmath22 @xcite was used , which results in @xmath23 mev for the corresponding mass scale .",
    "however , the quarkonium spectrum is not very sensitive to the precise value of the radius @xmath19 , in contrast with the resonance widths . in more recent work @xcite ,",
    "slightly larger transition radii have been applied , corresponding to values around 40 mev for @xmath24 .",
    "nevertheless , values of 3040 mev for the flavor - independent mass @xmath24 do not seem to bear any relation to an observed quantity for strong interactions .",
    "however , we will next present experimental evidence for the possible existence of a quantum with a mass of about 38 mev , which in the light of its relation to the @xmath18 mechanism we suppose to mediate quark - pair creation .",
    "moreover , its scalar properties make it a perfect candidate for the quantum associated with the above - discussed scalar field for confinement .",
    "@xcite , we made notice of an apparent interference effect around the @xmath25 threshold in the invariant - mass distribution of @xmath26 events , which we observed in preliminary radiation data of the babar collaboration @xcite .",
    "the effect , with a periodicity of about 74 mev , could be due to interference between the typical oscillation frequency of 190 mev of the @xmath27 pair and that of the gluon cloud .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "thus , a signal with the shape of a narrow breit - wigner resonance seems to be visible on the slope of the @xmath28 resonance , though with little more than 2@xmath10 relevance . nevertheless , by coincidence or not , it comes out exactly in the expected place , namely at @xmath29 mev .",
    "unfortunately , the data @xcite do not have enough statistics to pinpoint possible higher excitations as well .",
    "so we can not relate , to a minimum degree of accuracy , the other observed deficit enhancements to the possible existence of hybrid states .",
    "from the fact that the @xmath30 has not been observed before , one must conclude that it probably does not interact  at least to leading order  through electroweak forces , but instead couples exclusively to quarks and gluons .",
    "the interference effect we discussed in sec .",
    "[ oscillations ] might well be explained by @xmath30 exchange between the quarks , which interferes with the natural quark oscillations . moreover , since the interference effect is smaller for light quarks than for heavier ones , it is likely that their coupling to the @xmath30 is proportional to flavor mass , as one expects from theory .",
    "the @xmath30 could very well be just a light scalar glueball , albeit much lighter than found in refs .",
    "its low mass precludes decay into hadrons , while the absence of electroweak couplings does not allow it to decay into leptons either , at least to lowest order .",
    "it may decay , though , into photons via virtual quark loops , and through photons , eventually , into @xmath0 pairs .",
    "however , the probability for such reactions to occur is extremely remote , since the coupling between the quarks and the light scalar is proportional to the quark mass @xcite . in the case of bottom quarks , we found events of the order of or less than one percent of the total . for light quarks ,",
    "their mass ratio with respect to bottom quarks reduces this rate to @xmath31@xmath32 .",
    "hadrons will certainly interact with a light scalar ball of glue .",
    "for example , a proton struck by such a scalar particle may absorp it and then emit photons , or decay into a neutron and a lepton - neutrino pair . yet",
    "another possibility is that , being closed universes themselves , these scalar particles mainly collide elastically with hadronic matter . in that case , depending on their linear momentum , they may remove light nuclei from atoms .",
    "nevertheless , we do not see such processes happening around us",
    ". therefore , these light scalars are probably not abundantly present near us . however , in the early universe they may have existed , most probably inflated to hadrons under collisions . on the other hand , interactions with hadrons might have been observed in bubble - chamber experiments , where isolated protons could be the result of collisions with a light scalar particle emerging from one of the interaction vertices .",
    "light higgs fields have been considered in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model @xcite .",
    "furthermore , axions , which appear in models motivated by astrophysical observations , are assumed to have higgs - like couplings @xcite .",
    "model predictions for the branching fraction of @xmath33higgs decays , for higgs masses below @xmath34 @xcite , range from @xmath32 @xcite to @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the three anomalous events observed in the hypercp experiment @xcite were interpreted as the production of a scalar boson with a mass of 214.3 mev , decaying into a pair of muons @xcite . however , in ref .",
    "@xcite the babar collaboration found no evidence for dimuon decays of a light scalar particle in radiative decays of @xmath28 and @xmath36 mesons .",
    "the babar limits for dimuon decays of a light scalar particle rule out much of the parameter space allowed by the light - higgs @xcite and axion @xcite models . nonetheless , in ref .",
    "@xcite y .- j .",
    "zhang and h .- s .",
    "shao , pointed out that the transitions @xmath37higgs are not yet excluded by the lepton - universality test in @xmath38 decays studied by babar in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the light scalar glueball we have discussed here seems to correspond to the lowest - order empty - universe solution of ref .",
    "@xcite for strong interactions .",
    "it has similar properties as the electroweak higgs , but now for strong interactions .",
    "quarks couple to it with an intensity which is proportional to their mass , in the same way that mass couples to gravity @xcite . in the standard model @xcite , the higgs boson and the graviton are the only particles yet to be observed , and no higgs particle for strong interactions is anticipated .",
    "however , n.  trnqvist recently proposed @xcite the light scalar - meson nonet @xcite as the higgs bosons of strong interactions , while in ref .",
    "@xcite he obtained a nonzero pion mass by means of a small breaking of a relative symmetry between the electroweak and the strong interactions .",
    "a relation between the lightest scalar - meson nonet and glueballs has often been advocated by p.  minkowski and w.  ochs ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in our view",
    "though , the light scalar mesons are dynamically generated through @xmath39 pair creation / annihilation , which mixes the quark - antiquark and dimeson sectors @xcite .",
    "in sec .  [ intro ]",
    "we discussed why we expect an additional scalar particle to exist , besides the higgs boson for the electroweak sector .",
    "furthermore , we have estimated its mass based on the average radius for @xmath18 quark - pair creation , which had been extracted over the past three decades from numerous data on mesonic resonances ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . in sec .",
    "[ oscillations ] we recalled our results on an apparent interference effect in annihilation data , and stressed the possibility that it may stem from some internal oscillation with a frequency of about 38 mev . in sec .",
    "[ phenomenon ] we showed that missing data in the reactions @xmath0",
    "@xmath1 @xmath40 @xmath1 @xmath3 and @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath40 @xmath1 @xmath4 exhibit maxima at @xmath24 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , for @xmath43 mev .    each of the results , viz.the interference effect observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the small flavor - independent oscillations in electron - positron and proton - antiproton annihilation data , observed in ref .  @xcite and summarized in fig .",
    "[ interference ] , the excess signals visible in the @xmath5 mass distributions of @xmath28 @xmath1 @xmath40 @xmath1 @xmath4 ( fig .  [ mumuall2s ] ) , in @xmath36 @xmath1 @xmath40 @xmath1 @xmath4 ( fig .  [ alldiff]a ) , in @xmath36 @xmath1 @xmath44 @xmath1 @xmath4 ( fig .  [ alldiff]b ) , and in the @xmath0 mass distributions of @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ alldiff]c ) , and finally the resonance signal shown in fig .  [ hybrid ] , is much too small to make firm claims .",
    "however , we observe here that all points in the same direction . indeed",
    ", the probability must be close to zero that one accidentally finds the same oscillations in four different sets of data ( refs .",
    "@xcite ) involving different flavors , statistical fluctuations at @xmath45 mev in yet another four sets of different data ( figs .  [ mumuall2s ] and [ alldiff ] ) , and moreover a resonance - like fluctuation at @xmath46 mev in a further set of data ( fig .  [ hybrid ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the related mass comes where predicted by our analyses in mesonic spectroscopy ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .    in sec .",
    "[ gluons ] we discussed that , most probably , the missing signal is due to the emission of an  as yet unobserved  light scalar particle , while part of the excess data corroborates such an interpretation .",
    "since the corresponding particle has all the right properties , we conclude that we found first indications , of the possible existence of a higgs - like particle , namely the scalar boson related to confinement .",
    "furthermore , the data also suggest the existence of two replicas of the @xmath30 with masses that are two and three times heavier than the @xmath30 .",
    "in addition , we believe that this 38 mev boson , which we designate by @xmath30 , consists of a mini - universe filled with glue , thus forming a very light scalar glueball . furthermore , we have pinpointed the masses of possible @xmath6 hybrids , one of which shows up as an enhancement in the invariant - mass distribution of babar data , albeit with a 2@xmath10 significance at most .",
    "finally , we urge the babar collaboration to inspect their larger data set in order to settle , with higher statistics , the possible existence of the @xmath30 and the related @xmath6 hybrid spectrum .",
    "we are grateful for the precise measurements and data analyses of the babar , cdf , and cmd-2 collaborations , which made the present analysis possible .",
