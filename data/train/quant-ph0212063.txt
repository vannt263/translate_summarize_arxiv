    "quantum mechanics of open systems has lived a revival of interest especially after the early days of quantum computation @xcite when it has been realized that maintaining quantum coherence is an essential ingredient to fully exploit the new possibilities opened by the applications of quantum mechanics in computational physics .",
    "devices using unique quantum mechanical features can perform information processing in a much more efficient way than those at work nowadays .",
    "the key ingredients of quantum computing devices with computational capabilities that superseded these classical counterpart are basically :    1 .   the linear structure of their state space ; 2 .",
    "the _ unitary _ character of their dynamical evolution and 3 .",
    "the tensorized form of multiparticle states .",
    "the last one , in particular , represents a striking departure from classicality due to _ entanglement _ , since combining different systems results in an exponential growth of the available coding space ; moreover , the tensor product structure is the very basis of many efficient quantum manipulations .    of course , all this holds just for closed quantum systems .",
    "real world quantum systems interact with their environment to a greater or lesser extent .",
    "no matter how weak the coupling to such an environment , the evolution of quantum subsystems is eventually affected by non - unitary features such as decoherence , dissipation and heating . from a mathematical point of view",
    ", the relevant state space , given by density matrices , has now a convex structure and the allowed quantum dynamics is described by completely positive ( cp ) maps .",
    "initial pure states preparation are typically corrupted on extremely short time scales due to quantum coherence loss that turns them into mixed states : the initial information irreversibly leaks out from the system into the very large number of uncontrollable degrees of freedom of the environment .",
    "the above mentioned limitations are of course common to the many devices proposed for quantum computation @xcite . in the present contribution we will restrict ourselves to a detailed study of cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cavity qed ) @xcite . in this case one typically has a superconducting cavity with a coherent state fed into it .",
    "the interesting dynamics for quantum computation or for studying basic features of quantum mechanics is related to the ( unitary ) atom - field coupling",
    ". it will produce several typical quantum features such as entanglement and superpositions of states @xcite .",
    "however , it is impossible to avoid that from the moment a coherent field is fed into the cavity , it will couple to the environment and the effects of the latter will tend to destroy all the typically quantum mechanical features due to the unitary coupling .",
    "one of the aims of the present paper is to investigate the relation between the time scales of these two competing processes .",
    "another question which , to our knowledge , has not been satisfactorily answered so far is the following : the atom - field coupling depends crucially on the presence of the field in the cavity .",
    "if one is working at zero temperature it is clear that asymptotically the field will go to its vacuum state , rendering the unitary atom - field entanglement impossible quite independently of the environment .",
    "the basic question is : can one circumvent this problem by adding an external source which will be present during the whole process ?",
    "how does it affect all other time scales of the process ?    besides the fundamental issues addressed by the present work , the results obtained here can also have purely practical purposes .",
    "in fact , recently de oliveira , moussa and mizrahi @xcite proposed a control mechanism of a mesoscopic superposition of states (  schrdinger cat \" state ) in a dissipative cavity by the coupling with an external source .",
    "it is a variant of the scheme for creation and monitoring of coherent superpositions of field states described in @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , gerry studied the interaction of an atom with both a quantized cavity field and an external classical field .",
    "the interaction between atom and cavity field has a dispersive character . as a result",
    ", various forms of superpositions of cavity field states can be produced .",
    "further , robust coherent states may be generated in the steady state of the cavity if dissipation is included .",
    "the present work adds to those contributions in the sense that the source is treated quantum mechanically and dissipation is taken into account while atom and field interact .",
    "we show that the presence of an external source will attenuate dissipative effects , since it will maintain a constant field intensity in the cavity",
    ". however , since decoherence strongly depends on the field intensity , the presence of an external source will tend to increase typical decoherence time scales .    moreover , a rather new aspect treated here is the quantification of quantum correlations in this dissipative dynamics .",
    "it is not difficult to find measures of the degree of entanglement between subsystems of a global system whose state is pure .",
    "the situation dramatically changes , however , if the global state is characterized by a statistical mixture . for two qubits systems it is possible to provide for a quantitative measure of entanglement using the notion of concurrence @xcite",
    "for a particular initial state , we show that the atom - field system can be mapped onto a system composed by two two - dimensional subsystems .",
    "we therefore give analytical expressions for the time evolution of the entanglement between atom and field measured by the concurrence . to our knowledge , it is the first time that the time evolution of the concurrence is obtained for a dissipative system .",
    "this article was organized as follows : in section ii we find the time development of the atom - field state for any initial condition . in section iii",
    ", we calculate the time evolution of an initial state chosen and we obtain the idempotency defect or linear entropy of global and reduced density operators in order to study the purity loss of the compound system and of the atomic and field subsystems .",
    "we obtain correlation measures of the global state . in particular ,",
    "the degree of entanglement between atom and field is evaluated by finding an expression for concurrence .",
    "finally , the appendix describes the method used to obtain expressions for the solutions of different equations of motion that appear in section ii .",
    "before handling the complete problem of the dispersive atom - field interaction in a dissipative environment with an external source , let us consider the time evolution of a single driven electromagnetic field mode coupled to a thermal reservoir at null temperature .",
