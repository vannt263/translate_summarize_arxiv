    "the hydrogen atom in a static magnetic field @xcite and in crossed electric and magnetic fields @xcite is a non - integrable system which can be accessed both experimentally and theoretically and has attracted much attention during recent decades .",

    "the wave packet dynamics in atomic systems has been studied for the field - free hydrogen atom @xcite , and in particular for the atom in time - dependent external fields , e.g. , microwaves or short laser pulses .",
    "while rydberg wave packets are usually dispersive , the possible existence of nondispersive coherent states has been demonstrated for the hydrogen atom in microwave fields @xcite .    in the preceding paper @xcite",
