    "we recently outlined a new dimensional reduction scheme  @xcite .",
    "we show here in detail that applying this mechanism to the 10-dimensional massless dirac equation on majorana - weyl spinors leads to a quaternionic description of the full 4-dimensional ( free ) dirac equation which treats both massive and massless particles on an equal footing .",
    "furthermore , there are naturally 3 such descriptions , each of which corresponds to a generation of leptons with the correct number of spin / helicity states .    the massive dirac equation is usually formulated in the context of 4-component _ dirac spinors_. the 4 degrees of freedom correspond to the choice of spin ( up or down ) and the choice of particle or antiparticle .",
    "similarly , 2-component _ penrose spinors _ , which can be thought of as the square roots of null vectors , correspond to massless objects , such as photons . in section  [ complex ]",
    "we set the stage by reviewing these standard properties of the chiral description of the momentum - space dirac equation .",
    "penrose spinors are usually thought of as weyl projections of dirac spinors ; a dirac spinor contains twice the information of a single penrose spinor . as an alternative to doubling the number of ( complex ) components , however , we double the dimension of the underlying division algebra , from the complex numbers @xmath0 to the quaternions @xmath1 .",
    "the anticommutativity of the quaternions then enables us to package two complex representations of opposite chirality into the ( now quaternionic ) 2-component formalism . in section  [ quaternionic ]",
    "we show how to replace the usual 4-component complex dirac description with an equivalent 2-component quaternionic penrose description , and further discuss how this puts the massive and massless dirac equations on an equal footing .",
    "we then consider in section  [ octonionic ] the massless dirac equation on majorana - weyl spinors ( in momentum space ) in 10 dimensions , which can be nicely described in terms of 2-component spinors over the octonions @xmath2 , the only other normed division algebra besides @xmath3 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 .",
    "solutions of this equation are automatically quaternionic , and thus lend themselves to the preceding quaternionic description .    the final , and most important , ingredient in our approach is the the dimensional reduction scheme introduced in @xcite . in sections",
    "[ choosing ] and  [ spin ] we describe how the choice of a preferred octonionic unit , or equivalently of a preferred complex subalgebra @xmath4 , naturally reduces 10 spacetime dimensions to 4 , and further allows us to use the standard representation of the lorentz group @xmath5 as @xmath6 . putting this all together , we show in section  [ particles ] that the quaternionic spin / helicity eigenstates correspond precisely to the particle spectrum of a generation of leptons , consisting of 1 massive and 1 massless particle and their antiparticles .    in section  [ spinop ]",
    ", we discuss the remarkable fact that the quaternionic spin eigenstates are in fact simultaneous eigenstates of all 3 spin operators , although the other two eigenvalues are not real .",
    "finally , in section  [ discussion ] we discuss our results , in particular that , in a natural sense , there are precisely 3 such quaternionic subalgebras of the octonions , which we interpret as generations .",
    "there is a long history of trying to use the quaternions in 4-dimensional quantum mechanics ; see the comprehensive treatment in  @xcite and references therein .",
    "our approach is different in that we use the additional degrees of freedom to repackage existing information , rather than increasing the size of the underlying space of scalars .",
    "ultimately , this leads us to work in more than 4 spacetime dimensions .",
    "we also note a relatively unknown paper by dirac  @xcite which , much to our surprise , contains the precursors of several of the key ideas presented here .",
    "the octonions were first introduced into quantum mechanics by jordan  @xcite .",
    "there has in fact been much recent interest in using the octonions in ( higher - dimensional ) field theory ; excellent modern treatments can be found in  @xcite .",
    "after much of this work was completed , we became aware of the recent work of schcking _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who also use a quaternionic formalism to describe a single generation of leptons .",
    "they further speculate that extending the formalism to the octonions would yield a description of a single generation of quarks as well .",
    "although the language is strikingly similar , our approach differs fundamentally from theirs in its description of momentum .",
    "ultimately , this hinges on our interpretation of the obvious @xmath7 as spin , whereas schcking and coworkers interpret it as isospin .",
    "the standard weyl representation of the gamma matrices in signature is @xmath8 where @xmath9 for @xmath10 denote the usual pauli matrices rather than @xmath11 to denote the complex unit . ]",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 is the @xmath14 identity matrix .",
    "the original formulation of the dirac equation involves the even part of the clifford algebra , historically written in terms of the matrices @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "explicitly , the momentum - space dirac equation in this signature can be written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is a 4-component complex ( dirac ) spinor .    writing @xmath19 in terms of two 2-component complex weyl ( or penrose ) spinors @xmath20 and @xmath21 as @xmath22 and expanding ( [ diraci ] ) leads to @xmath23 this leads us to identify the momentum 4-vector with the @xmath14 hermitian matrix @xmath24 where we have set @xmath25 , which reduces ( [ diracii ] ) to the two equations @xmath26 where the tilde denotes trace - reversal .",
    "explicitly , @xmath27 which reverses the sign of @xmath28 , so that @xmath29 can be identified with the 1-form dual to @xmath30",
    ". this interpretation is strengthened by noting that @xmath31 where the identification of the norm of @xmath32 with @xmath33 is just the compatibility condition between ( [ diraciiia ] ) and ( [ diraciiib ] ) .",
    "the _ quaternions _ @xmath1 are the associative , noncommutative , normed division algebra over the reals .",
    "the quaternions are spanned by the identity element @xmath34 and three imaginary units , usually denoted @xmath11 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "quaternionic conjugation , denoted with a bar , is given by reversing the sign of each imaginary unit .",

    ", @xmath38 , @xmath39 for cartesian basis vectors originates with the quaternions , which were introduced by hamilton as an early step towards vectors  @xcite . making the obvious identification of vectors @xmath40 , @xmath41 with imaginary quaternions @xmath42 , @xmath43 , then the real part of the quaternionic product @xmath44 is ( minus ) the dot product @xmath45 , while the imaginary part is the cross product @xmath46 .",
    "] however , in order to avoid conflict with our subsequent conventions for the octonions , we will instead label our quaternionic basis @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "the imaginary unit @xmath47 will play the role of the complex unit @xmath11 , and , as we will see later , @xmath48 will label this particular quaternionic subalgebra of the octonions . in terms of the cayley - dickson process  @xcite",
    ", we have @xmath50    as vector spaces , @xmath51 , which allows us to identify @xmath52 with @xmath53 in several different ways .",
    "we choose the identification @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "equivalently , we can write this identification in terms of the weyl ( penrose ) spinors @xmath20 and @xmath21 as @xmath56 where we have introduced the generalized pauli matrix @xmath57    since ( [ identifyk ] ) is clearly a vector space isomorphism , there is also an isomorphism relating the linear maps on these spaces .",
    "we can use the induced isomorphism to rewrite the dirac equation ( [ diraci ] ) in 2-component quaternionic language .",
    "direct computation yields the correspondences @xmath58 and @xmath59 and of course also @xmath60 since the left - hand - side is the @xmath61 identity matrix and the right - hand - side is the @xmath14 identity matrix . direct translation of ( [ diraci ] ) now leads to the quaternionic dirac equation @xmath62 working backwards , we can separate this into an equation not involving @xmath48 , which is precisely ( [ diraciiib ] ) , and an equation involving @xmath48 , which is @xmath63 multiplying this equation on the left by @xmath64 , and using the remarkable identity @xmath65 reduces ( [ diracv ] ) to ( [ diraciiia ] ) , as expected .",
    "so far , we have done nothing more or less than rewrite the usual momentum - space dirac equation in 2-component quaternionic language .",
    "however , the appearance of the term @xmath66 suggests a way to put in the mass term on the same footing as the other terms , which we now exploit .",
    "multiplying ( [ diraciv ] ) on the left by @xmath67 and using ( [ remarkable ] ) brings the dirac equation to the form @xmath68 where we have introduced the 2-component quaternionic spinor @xmath69 when written out in full , ( [ diracvi ] ) takes the form @xmath70 this clearly suggests viewing the mass as an additional spacelike component of a higher - dimensional vector .",
    "furthermore , since the matrix multiplying @xmath71 has determinant zero , this higher - dimensional vector is null .",
    "we thus appear to have reduced the massive dirac equation in 4 dimensions to the massless dirac , or weyl , equation in higher dimensions , thus putting the massive and massless cases on an equal footing .",
    "this expectation is indeed correct , as we show in the next section in the more general octonionic setting .",

    "each imaginary unit squares to @xmath37 @xmath73 and the full multiplication table can be conveniently encoded in the 7-point projective plane , as shown in figure  [ omult ] ; each line is to be thought of as a circle .",
    "the octonionic units can be grouped into ( the imaginary parts of ) quaternionic subalgebras in 7 different ways , corresponding to the 7 lines in the figure ; these will be referred to as quaternionic triples . within each triple ,",
    "the arrows give the orientation , so that e.g. @xmath74 any three imaginary basis units which do not lie in a such a triple anti - associate .",
    "note that any two octonions automatically lie in ( at least one ) quaternionic triple , so that expressions containing only two independent imaginary octonionic directions do associate .",

    "we can therefore identify the tilde operation with the metric dual , so that @xmath89 represents the covariant vector field @xmath90 .",
    "just as in the complex case ( compare  ( [ cgamma ] ) ) , this can be thought of ( up to associativity issues ) as a weyl representation of the underlying clifford algebra @xmath91 in terms of @xmath61 gamma matrices of the form @xmath92 which are now octonionic .",

    "thus , for solutions ( [ solii ] ) , the weyl equation ( [ weyl ] ) itself becomes quaternionic .",
    "furthermore , it follows immediately from ( [ solii ] ) that @xmath128 comparing this with ( [ msq ] ) , we see that the vector constructed from @xmath71 is proportional to @xmath119 , or in more traditional language @xmath129 which can be interpreted as the requirement that the pauli - lubanski spin vector be proportional to the momentum for a massless particle .",
    "the description in the preceding section of 10-dimensional minkowski space in terms of hermitian octonionic matrices is a direct generalization of the usual description of ordinary ( 4-dimensional ) minkowski space in terms of complex hermitian matrices .",

    "the projection of a 10-dimensional null vector onto this subspace is a causal 4-dimensional vector , which is null if and only if the original vector was already contained in the subspace , and timelike otherwise .",
    "the time orientation of the projected vector is the same as that of the original , and the induced mass is given by the norm of the remaining 6 components .",
    "furthermore , the ordinary lorentz group @xmath5 clearly sits inside the lorentz group @xmath130 via the identification of their double - covers , the spin groups @xmath131 , namely , see also  @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath132    therefore ,",
    "all it takes to break 10 spacetime dimensions to 4 is to choose a preferred octonionic unit to play the role of the complex unit .",

    "however , care must be taken when constructing the lie algebra @xmath138 , due to the lack of commutativity .    under the usual action of @xmath139 on a hermitian matrix @xmath84 ( thought of as a spacetime vector via ( [ qdef ] ) ) , namely @xmath140 we can identify the basis rotations as usual as @xmath141 corresponding to rotations by the angle @xmath142 about the @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and @xmath145 axes , respectively .",

    "it is straightforward to show that the real eigenvalues are @xmath161 as expected .",
    "however , the form of the eigenvectors is a bit more surprising : @xmath162 where @xmath55 are any elements of the preferred complex subalgebra , and @xmath48 is any imaginary octonionic unit orthogonal to @xmath47 , so that @xmath48 and @xmath47 anticommute",
    ". thus , the components of spin eigenstates are contained in the quaternionic subalgebra @xmath163 which is generated by @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",

    ", we can therefore read off the components of the 4-dimensional momentum @xmath178 directly from @xmath179 .",
    "we can use a lorentz transformation to bring a massive particle to rest , or to orient the momentum of a massless particle to be in the @xmath143-direction .",
    "if @xmath180 , we can distinguish particles from antiparticles by the sign of the term involving @xmath33 , which is the coefficient of @xmath64 in @xmath119 .",
    "equivalently , we have the particle / antiparticle projections ( at rest ) @xmath181 if @xmath182 , however , we can only distinguish particles from antiparticles in momentum space by the sign of @xmath183 , as usual ; this is the same as the sign in ( [ proportional ] ) . similarly , in this language , the chiral projection operator is constructed from @xmath184 however , as with spin , we must multiply by @xmath47 in the correct place , obtaining @xmath185 as a result , even though @xmath186 is a multiple of the identity , @xmath187 is not , and the operators @xmath188 project @xmath52 into the weyl subspaces @xmath189 as desired .    combining the spin and particle information , over the quaternionic subalgebra @xmath163 determined by @xmath48 and @xmath47",

    "we also find 1 massless spin-@xmath190  particle involving @xmath48 moving in the @xmath143-direction , with a single helicity state , @xmath193 which corresponds , as usual , to both a particle and its antiparticle .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath194 corresponds to a massless particle with the same helicity moving in the opposite direction , not to a different particle with the opposite helicity .",
    "each of the above states may be multiplied ( on the _ right _ ) by an arbitrary complex number .",
    "there is also a single _ complex _ massless spin-@xmath190  particle , with the opposite helicity , which is given in momentum space by @xmath195 as with the other massless momentum space states , this describes both a particle and an antiparticle . alone among the particles , this one does not contain @xmath48 , and hence does not depend on the choice of identification of a particular quaternionic subalgebra @xmath1 satisfying @xmath196 .",
    "we saw in the previous section that the spin up particle state @xmath197 is a simultaneous eigenvector of the spin operator and particle projections , that is @xmath198 remarkably , @xmath197 is also an eigenvector of the remaining spin operators , namely @xmath199 although the eigenvalues are not real .",
    "similar statements hold for the corresponding spin down and antiparticle states , although with different eigenvalues .",
    "we find it illuminating to consider the equivalent right eigenvalue problem @xmath200 for the non - hermitian operator @xmath201 .",
    "the operator @xmath201 admits imaginary eigenvalues @xmath202 , which correspond to the usual spin eigenstates . but",
    "@xmath201 also admits other imaginary eigenvalues !",
    "these correspond precisely to the eigenvalues of @xmath203 which are not real , and in fact not in @xmath0 .",
    "we emphasize that the spin operators _ are _ self - adjoint ( with respect to  ( [ selfadj ] ) ) .",
    "however , over the octonions it is not true that all the eigenvalues of hermitian matrices , are real  @xcite ; the case of self - adjoint operators is similar .",
    "how does it affect the traditional interpretation of quantum mechanics to have simultaneous eigenstates of all 3 spin operators ?",
    "the essential feature which permits this is that only one of the eigenvalues is real , and only real eigenvalues correspond to observables .",
    "thus , from this point of view , the reason that the spin operators fail to commute is not that they do not admit simultaneous eigenstates , but rather that their _ eigenvalues _ fail to commute !",
    "furthermore , while ( right ) multiplication by a ( complex ) phase does not change any of the real eigenvalues , the nonreal eigenvalues do depend on the phase , since the phase does nt commute with the eigenvalue !",
    "does this allow one _ in principle _ to determine the exact spin orientation , even if no corresponding measurement exists ?",
    "we have shown how the massless dirac equation in 10 dimensions reduces to the ( massive and massless ) dirac equation in 4 dimensions when a preferred octonionic unit is chosen .",
    "the quaternionic dirac equation discussed in section  [ quaternionic ] describes 1 massive particle with 2 spin states , 1 massless particle with only 1 helicity , and their antiparticles .",
    "we identify this set of particles with a generation of leptons .",
    "furthermore , as can be seen from figure  [ omult ] , there is room in the octonions for exactly 3 such quaternionic descriptions which have only their complex part in common , corresponding to replacing @xmath48 in turn by @xmath11 and @xmath35 .",
    "we identify these 3 quaternionic spaces as describing 3 generations of leptons .",
    "there is , however , one additional massless particle / antiparticle pair , given by ( [ oz ] ) .",
    "being purely complex , it does not belong to any generation , and it has the opposite helicity from the other massless particles .",
    "we do not currently have a physical interpretation for this additional particle ; if this theory is to correspond to nature , then this additional particle must for some reason not interact much with anything else .",
    "note that the mass appears in this theory as an overall scale , which can be thought of as the length scale associated with the corresponding quaternionic direction .",
    "in particular , antiparticles must have the same mass as the corresponding particles .",
    "this suggests that the only free parameters in this theory are 3 length scales , corresponding to the masses in each generation .",
    "the theory presented here can be elegantly rewritten in terms of _ jordan matrices _ ,",
    "i.e.  @xmath204 octonionic hermitian matrices , along the lines of the approach to the superparticle presented in  @xcite .",
    "this approach , which is briefly described in  @xcite , demonstrates that the theory is invariant under a much bigger group than the lorentz group , namely the exceptional group @xmath205 ( actually , @xmath206 , since only conformal transformations are involved ) .",
    "we therefore believe it may be possible to extend the theory so as to include quarks and color .    finally ,",
    "as noted in  @xcite , we have worked only in momentum space , and have discussed only free particles .",
    "perhaps our most intriguing result is the observation that the introduction of position space would require a preferred complex unit in the fourier transform .",
    "similarly , a description of interactions based on minimal coupling would again involve a preferred complex unit .",
    "therefore , it does not appear to be _",
    "possible _ to use the formalism presented here to give a full , interacting , 10-dimensional theory in which all 10 spacetime dimensions are on an equal footing .",
    "we view this as a tantalizing hint that not only interactions , but even 4-dimensional spacetime itself , may arise as a consequence of the symmetry breaking from 10 dimensions to 4 !",
