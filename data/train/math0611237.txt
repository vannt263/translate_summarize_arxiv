    "we present a simple new approach to the solution of a wide class of spectral and resonance problems on infinite domains with regular ends , including those found in the study of quantum switches , waveguides , and acoustic scatterers .",
    "our algorithm is part analytical and part numerical and is essentially a combination of four classical approaches ( domain decomposition , boundary elements , finite elements and spectral methods ) each of which is used in its most natural context .",
    "our method has three main advantages .",
    "firstly , it allows one to exploit existing library software for pdes to reduce to a minimum the amount of new code which must be written : meshing , choice of basis functions , preconditioning and solution of linear systems can all be delegated to the library code .",
    "secondly , the method is well adapted to handling resonance or scattering problems , where neumann - to - dirichlet maps must be continued analytically as functions of the spectral parameter .",
    "thirdly , the need to solve boundary value problems for many different choices of the spectral parameter is totally removed .",
    "a brief outline of the solution procedure is as follows .",
    "firstly , the infinite domain on which the problem is posed is decomposed ( _ domain decomposition _ ) into a union of a bounded domain and a finite number of infinite regular ends , e.g. cylinders .",
    "we need to assume that on each of these ends , the partial differential equation admits separation of variables .",
    "the problem can thereby be reduced to a problem on the finite portion of the domain with extra boundary conditions on the interfaces with the attached ends .",
    "this problem can be reduced to a problem on the interfaces through the interior ` neumann - to - dirichlet ' map , whose matrix elements , with respect to a specially chosen basis on the interfaces ( _ boundary element method _ ) are calculated in terms of traces of ` mixed ' neumann eigenfunctions from the interior domain ( _ spectral method _ ) , which is probably the main new idea of this article .",
    "the neumann eigenfunctions are themselves computed by a _ finite element method_. the resulting problem on the interface can be solved by finding roots of some monotone functions calculated by solving a generalized matrix eigenproblem of modest size .",
    "this is done by elementary means .",
    "apart from the need to be able to separate variables at infinity , the remaining parts of our approach work for a wide class of problems with minimal restrictions on the pde coefficients and the boundary conditions . for simplicity of exposition ,",
    "however , most of this paper is presented for the case of the helmholtz equation in domains with cylindrical ends , or in domains exterior to an obstacle .    since the 1960s",
    "there has been a lot of important theoretical and numerical work done on the solution of spectral and scattering problems on the sort of domains we consider .",
    "the literature is too extensive to review adequately here : we mention just a few trends .    on the purely mathematical side ,",
    "attention has recently concentrated on finding conditions sufficient for existence of eigenvalues either below the essential spectrum or embedded in it , see e.g. @xcite . additionally , there are some partial results on non - existence of eigenvalues in the lower part of the essential spectrum @xcite , and on perturbations of embedded eigenvalues which turn them into resonances . for an abstract approach",
    "to counting the eigenvalues , see @xcite .    for numerical treatments ,",
    "boundary integral and boundary element methods have often been employed  see , e.g. , colton and kress @xcite , brebbia , telles and wrobel @xcite for reviews .",
    "others have considered domain truncation methods coupled with the use of ` non - reflecting ' boundary conditions  see , e.g. , hgstrom and keller @xcite ; givoli , patlashenko and keller @xcite . for the particular case of waveguides , special efficient numerical approaches can be found in aslanyan , parnovski and vassiliev @xcite and in mciver , linton , mciver and zhang @xcite ; the scattering matrix approach has also been developed in , e.g. , bagraev , mikhailova , pavlov , prokhorov and yafyasov @xcite and in semenikhin , pavlov and ryzhii @xcite .",
    "various related numerical methods and applications to a variety of physically motivated special cases and generalisations can be found , e.g. , in @xcite and references therein .",
    "we do not claim that our approach is more numerically efficient than any of these : what is certainly true , however , is that it is much simpler to implement , requiring just a few lines of matlab code rather than some serious work by expert programmers .",
    "some examples of our code are available from the authors web pages ; we encourage the reader to download , modify , and use it .",
    "by @xmath0 , @xmath1 we denote an unbounded open connected domain with @xmath2 non - intersecting cylindrical ends .",
    "namely , for each @xmath3 we choose local coordinates @xmath4 such that the cylinder @xmath5 is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the open bounded connected ( but not necessarily simply connected ) @xmath8-dimensional cross - section of @xmath5 , and we suppose that @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a connected bounded open set . further geometrical definitions ( interior part of @xmath11 , cylindrical ends of @xmath11 and interfaces ) are introduced in the next section .    throughout the paper",
    "we assume that the boundary @xmath12 is at least piecewise @xmath13 smooth and , for simplicity , satisfies both interior and exterior uniform cone conditions ( i.e. @xmath12 does not have any cusps ) .",
    "we consider , in @xmath11 , the spectral problem @xmath14 subject to the boundary conditions @xmath15 here the unit normal @xmath16 to @xmath17 points outwards . we shall refer to problem , as `` problem ( p ) '' .",
    "we impose the following restrictions on the boundary coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath19 :    * @xmath20 and @xmath21 are piecewise smooth functions on the boundary @xmath17 ; * @xmath22 ; * on each connected component of the part @xmath23 of the infinite boundary of each cylindrical end @xmath5 the functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 are constant ( but the constants are allowed to differ between the cylinders and even between the connected components of the boundary of each cylinder ) .    to finalize our notation , we shall from now on refer to the sets @xmath24 and their union @xmath25 as _ cylindrical ends _ of @xmath11 and the sets @xmath26 and their union @xmath27 as _",
    "we also define the _ interior part _ of @xmath11 as @xmath28 and denote by @xmath29 the part of its boundary shared with the boundary of @xmath11 , see figure [ fig : domain ] .",
    "we emphasize once more that according to ( b@xmath30 ) the boundary condition are constant on each connected component of @xmath31",
    "as the reader shall easily see later on , all our methods apply , with minimal modifications , to the general second order spectral boundary value problem @xmath32 @xmath33 with @xmath34 being a sufficiently smooth positive definite @xmath35-matrix valued function , and @xmath36 being an @xmath37 scalar potential .",
    "then , in addition to assumptions ( b@xmath38)(b@xmath39 ) , we also require that @xmath40 and @xmath41 be constant on each cylindrical end @xmath5 ( but the constants are allowed to differ between the cylinders ) .",
    "although one can easily formulate all the results and algorithms for the general case , , we deliberately describe only problem ( p ) for the laplacian in order to preserve the simplicity and clarity of exposition .",
    "we always understand the spectral problem ( p ) in the variational sense .",
    "namely , let @xmath42 be the part of the boundary on which is the dirichlet condition .",
    "let @xmath43 be the set of all infinitely differentiable functions on @xmath11 supported away from @xmath44 .",
    "we define the sesquilinear form @xmath45:=\\int_\\omega \\nabla u\\cdot\\overline{\\nabla v } + \\int_{\\partial\\omega\\setminus \\partial_d\\omega }   \\frac{a}{b } u\\overline{v}\\ ] ] first on @xmath46 , and then extend it to the closure @xmath47 of @xmath46 with respect to the norm associated with .    from now on",
    ", we shall understand problem ( p ) as the spectral problem @xmath48=\\lambda{{\\langleu , v\\rangle}}$ ] , where @xmath49 denotes the scalar product in @xmath50 , with the form domain in @xmath47 .",
    "in particular @xmath51 is an _",
    "eigenvalue _ of problem ( p ) if there exists a nontrivial function @xmath52 such that @xmath53 for all @xmath54 .",
    "we need to consider the following _ transversal _ problem on the joint interface @xmath55 : @xmath56 here @xmath57 is the @xmath8-dimensional laplacian and @xmath58 is the derivative with respect to the external normal @xmath59 to @xmath60 ( which of course coincides here with the normal @xmath16 to @xmath12 ) .",
    "we recall that @xmath20 and @xmath21 are constant on each connected component of @xmath60 .",
    "this problem has a rigorous formulation in terms of sesquilinear forms analogous to that introduced in ( [ eq : form ] ) but with @xmath11 replaced by @xmath55 throughout .",
    "the assumptions ( b@xmath61 ) , ( b@xmath62 ) and ( b@xmath30 ) ensure that the problem has a purely discrete spectrum of eigenvalues @xmath63 , enumerated in increasing order and repeated according to multiplicity ; we denote by @xmath64 the corresponding eigenfunctions normalized in @xmath65 .",
    "we also set @xmath66 .",
    "it is well known that the essential spectrum of problem ( p ) is then given by @xmath67 and , moreover , that its multiplicity at a point @xmath68 is equal to the number of @xmath69 which are less than or equal to @xmath51 .",
    "we shall often refer to the number @xmath69 as the @xmath70-th _ threshold_.    for each @xmath71 we define @xmath72 set @xmath73 , and denote by @xmath74 the projection in @xmath65 onto @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "we also define @xmath77 .",
    "we define formally two neumann to dirichlet operators , for the interior part @xmath78 and cylindrical ends @xmath79 .",
    "firstly , the interior neumann to dirichlet operator @xmath80 is the map which maps any suitable function @xmath81 defined on @xmath55 to the trace on @xmath55 of the solution of the boundary value problem @xmath82 ( where by @xmath16 we always mean the unit normal to @xmath55 directed outwards from @xmath78 ) provided @xmath51 is not an eigenvalue for the corresponding neumann problem @xmath83    secondly , the exterior neumann to dirichlet operator @xmath84 is the map which maps any suitable function @xmath81 defined on @xmath55 to the trace on @xmath55 of the solution of the exterior boundary value problem @xmath85 ( the normal @xmath16 on @xmath55 , as before , points outwards from @xmath78 along the positive @xmath86-axis of each cylindrical end , and therefore towards @xmath79 ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath87 is an eigenfunction of problem ( p ) with eigenvalue @xmath51 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath87 is infinitely differentiable at any interior point of @xmath11 . in particular , therefore , @xmath87 and its gradient restrict to the interface @xmath55 as smooth functions , and so we may define @xmath88 thus @xmath89 and @xmath81 satisfy @xmath90 so that a necessary condition for @xmath51 to be an eigenvalue of problem ( p ) is that @xmath91 be an eigenvalue of the operator pencil problem @xmath92 ( a number @xmath93 is called an eigenvalue of a general operator pencil @xmath94 if zero is an eigenvalue of the operator @xmath95 . )",
    "suppose that @xmath96 is a solution of the exterior problem ( [ eq : extneum ] ) for some @xmath51 ( not necessarily an eigenvalue of problem ( p ) ) . a formal expansion of @xmath96 in terms of the eigenfunctions @xmath97 of the transversal problem ( [ eq : trans ] ) , @xmath98 with account of yields for the functions @xmath99 the ordinary differential boundary value problems @xmath100 where @xmath101 denotes the scalar product in @xmath65 .",

    "then @xmath111 and we have therefore defined the non - negative self - adjoint operators @xmath112 acting as @xmath113    it is clear from and from the construction that the quadratic form @xmath114 is monotone increasing in @xmath51 on each interval @xmath115 .",

    "a formal integration by parts shows that @xmath120    this allows us to define a quadratic form @xmath121:=({\\mathcal{r}}_\\lambda^0 g , g ) = \\langle \\nabla v , \\nabla v \\rangle   - \\lambda \\langle v , v \\rangle\\ ] ] ( where @xmath122 solves ) associated with @xmath123 and hence to regard @xmath123 either as a self - adjoint operator on a domain in @xmath65 or , under suitable smoothness restrictions on the boundary @xmath124 , as a map on a scale of sobolev spaces from @xmath125 to @xmath126 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we emphasize that we impose a condition that @xmath51 is not an eigenvalue of ( [ eq : intn ] )  for ways of bypassing this condition see @xcite .    for a fixed @xmath127 , the form @xmath128 $ ]",

    "let @xmath81 be fixed and let @xmath129 denote the derivative with respect to @xmath51 of the solution @xmath122 of ( [ eq : intg ] ) .",

    "exactly the same argument can be used to prove the monotonicity in @xmath51 of the form of the operator @xmath133 , which we established at the end of the previous section by direct inspection of .",
    "in   [ sec : ndcyl ] , we constructed an explicit representation for the neumann to dirichlet operator @xmath133 associated with the problem on a cylindrical end .",
    "the aim of this section is to do the same for the _ interior _ neumann to dirichlet map @xmath123 , and we want to emphasize that the following trick is in fact the focal point of this paper .    in the setting of problem ,",
