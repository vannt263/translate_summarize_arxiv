    "if this conclusion applies to spheroid formation in general , the simulations demonstrate that models for the origin and evolution of galaxies must account for black hole growth and feedback in a fully _ self - consistent _ manner .",
    "analytical and semi - analytical modeling @xcite suggests that , beyond a certain threshold , feedback energy from black holes can expel gas from the centers of galaxies , shutting down accretion onto them and limiting their masses .",
    "however , these calculations usually ignore the impact of this process on star formation and therefore do not explain the link between black hole growth and spheroid formation , and furthermore make simplifying assumptions about the dynamics of such accretion .",
    "for example , the duration of black hole growth is a free parameter , which is fixed either using observational estimates or assumed to be similar to e.g.  the dynamical time of the host galaxy or the @xmath5-folding time for eddington - limited black hole growth @xmath6yr for accretion with radiative efficiency @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite .",

    "( 2005a , b , c , d ) has shown that the merger simulations can account for quasar phenomena as a phase of black hole growth . unlike what has been assumed in e.g.semi-analytical studies of quasars , the simulations predict complicated evolution for quasar lifetimes , fueling rates for black hole accretion , obscuration , and quasar light curves .",
    "the light curves were studied by @xcite , who showed that the self - termination process gives observable lifetimes @xmath9yr for bright optical quasars and predicts a large population of obscured sources as a natural stage of quasar evolution , as implied by observations ( for a review , see brandt & hasinger 2005 ) . @xcite analyzed simulations over a range of galaxy masses and found that the quasar light curves and lifetimes are always qualitatively similar , with both the intrinsic and observed quasar lifetimes being decreasing functions of luminosity , with longer lifetimes at all luminosities for higher - mass ( higher peak luminosity ) systems .",
    "the dependence of the lifetime on luminosity led @xcite to suggest a new interpretation of the quasar luminosity function , in which the steep bright - end consists of quasars radiating near the eddington limit and is directly related to the distribution of intrinsic peak luminosities ( or final black hole masses ) as has been assumed previously ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "the `` break '' in the luminosity function corresponds directly to the _ peak _ in the distribution of intrinsic quasar properties . as argued by @xcite",
    "this new interpretation of the luminosity function can self - consistently explain various properties of both the quasar and galaxy populations , connecting the origin of galaxy spheroids , supermassive black holes , and quasars .    motivated by these results , and earlier work by many others which we summarize below , in this paper we consider a picture for galaxy formation and evolution , illustrated schematically as a `` cosmic cycle '' in figure  [ fig : cosmiccycle ] , in which starbursts , quasars , and the simultaneous formation of spheroids and supermassive black holes represent connected phases in the lives of galaxies .",
    "mergers are expected to occur regularly in a hierarchical universe , particularly at high redshifts .",
    "those between gas - rich galaxies drive nuclear inflows of gas , triggering starbursts and fueling the growth of supermassive black holes . during most of this phase ,",
    "quasar activity is obscured , but once a black hole dominates the energetics of the central region , feedback expels gas and dust , making the black hole visible briefly as a bright quasar .",
    "eventually , as the gas is further heated and expelled , quasar activity can no longer be maintained and the merger remnant relaxes to a normal galaxy with a spheroid and a supermassive black hole . in some cases , depending on the gas content of the progenitors , the remnant may also have a disk ( springel & hernquist 2005 ; robertson et al .",
    "the remnant will then evolve passively and would be available as a seed to repeat the above cycle . as the universe evolves and more gas is consumed ,",
    "the mergers involving gas - rich galaxies will shift towards lower masses , explaining the decline in the population of the brightest quasars from @xmath11 to the present , and the remnants that are gas - poor will redden quickly owing to the termination of star formation by black hole feedback ( springel et al .",
    "2005a ) , so that they resemble elliptical galaxies , surrounded by hot x - ray emitting halos ( e.g.  cox et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "there is considerable observational support for this scenario , which has led the development of this picture for the co - evolution of galaxies and quasars over recent decades .",
    "infrared ( ir ) luminous galaxies are thought to be powered in part by starbursts ( e.g.  soifer et al .",
    "1984a , b ; sanders et al .  1986 , 1988a , b ;",
    "for a review , see e.g.soifer et al .",
    "1987 ) , and the most intense examples locally , ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , are invariably associated with mergers ( e.g.  allen et al .  1985 ; joseph & wright 1985 ; armus et al .",
    "1987 ; kleinmann et al .  1988 ;",
    "melnick & mirabel 1990 ; for reviews , see sanders & mirabel 1996 and jogee 2004 ) .",
    "radio observations show that ulirgs have large , central concentrations of dense gas ( e.g.scoville et al .",
    "1986 ; sargent et al .",
    "1987 , 1989 ) , providing a fuel supply to feed black hole growth .",
    "indeed , some ulirgs have `` warm '' ir spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , suggesting that they harbor buried quasars ( e.g.  sanders et al .",
    "1988c ) , an interpretation strengthened by x - ray observations demonstrating the presence of two non - thermal point sources in ngc6240 @xcite , which are thought to be supermassive black holes that are heavily obscured at visual wavelengths ( e.g.  gerssen et al .  2004",
    "; max et al .  2005 , alexander et al .",
    "2005a , b ) .",
    "these lines of evidence , together with the overlap between bolometric luminosities of ulirgs and quasars , indicate that quasars are the descendents of an infrared luminous phase of galaxy evolution caused by mergers ( sanders et al .",
    "1988a ) , an interpretation supported by observations of quasar hosts ( e.g.stockton 1978 ; heckman et al .",
    "1984 ; stockton & mackenty 1987 ; stockton & ridgway 1991 ; hutchings & neff 1992 ; bahcall et al .",
    "1994 , 1995 , 1997 ; canalizo & stockton 2001 ) .",
    "however , many of the physical processes that connect the phases of evolution in figure  [ fig : cosmiccycle ] are not well understood .",
    "early simulations showed that mergers produce objects resembling galaxy spheroids ( e.g.  barnes 1988 , 1992 ; hernquist 1992 , 1993a ) and that if the progenitors are gas - rich , gravitational torques funnel gas to the center of the remnant ( e.g.  barnes & hernquist 1991 , 1996 ) , producing a starburst ( e.g.  mihos & hernquist 1996 ) , but these works did not explore the relationship of these events to black hole growth and quasar activity . while a combination of arguments based on time variability and energetics suggests that quasars are produced by the accretion of gas onto supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies ( e.g.  salpeter 1964 ; zeldovich & novikov 1964 ; lynden - bell 1969 ) , the mechanism that provides the trigger to fuel quasars therefore remains uncertain .",
    "furthermore , there have been no comprehensive models that describe the transition between ulirgs and quasars that can simultaneously account for observed correlations like the @xmath3-@xmath4 relation .    here , we study these relationships using numerical simulations of galaxy mergers that account for the consequences of black hole growth . in our simulations ,",
    "black holes accrete and grow throughout a merger event , producing complex , time - varying quasar activity .",
    "quasars reach a peak luminosity , @xmath12 , during the `` blowout '' phase of evolution where feedback energy from black hole growth begins to drive away the gas , eventually slowing accretion . prior to and following this brief period of peak activity , quasars radiate at instantaneous luminosities , @xmath13 , with @xmath14 . however , we show that even with this complex behavior , the global characteristics that determine the observed properties of quasars , i.e.  lifetimes , light curves , and obscuration , can be expressed as functions of @xmath13 and @xmath12 , allowing us to make predictions for quasar populations that agree well with observations , supporting the scenario sketched in figure  [ fig : cosmiccycle ] .",
    "in   [ sec : methods ] , we discuss our methodology and show how the quasar lifetimes and obscuration from our simulations can be expressed as functions of the instantaneous and peak luminosities of quasars .",
    "we also define a set of commonly adopted models for the quasar lifetime and obscuration against which we compare our predictions throughout . in ",
    "[ sec : lf ] , we apply our models to the quasar luminosity function , using the observed luminosity function to determine the distribution of quasar peak luminosities , and show that this allows us to simultaneously reproduce the hard x - ray , soft x - ray , and optical quasar luminosity functions at all redshifts @xmath15 , and the distribution of column densities in both optical and x - ray samples . in   [ sec : blqso ] , we determine the time in our simulations when quasars will be observable as broad - line objects , and use this to predict the broad - line luminosity function and fraction of broad - line objects in quasar samples , as a function of luminosity , as well as the mass function of low - redshift , active broad - line quasars . in   [ sec : eddington ] , we estimate the distribution of eddington ratios in our simulations as a function of luminosity , and infer eddington ratios in observed samples at different redshifts . in   [ sec : smbh ] , we use our modeling to predict both the mass distribution and total density of present - day relic supermassive black holes , and describe their evolution with redshift . in   [ sec : xrb ] , we similarly apply this model to predict the integrated cosmic x - ray background spectrum , accounting for the observed spectrum from @xmath16kev . in   [ sec : discussion ] , we discuss the primary qualitative implications of our results and propose falsifiable tests of our picture . finally , in   [ sec : finis ] , we conclude and suggest directions for future work .    throughout",

    "single _ merger event .",
    "we use the term `` quasar lifetime '' to refer to the time spent by such a quasar at a given luminosity or fraction of the quasar peak luminosity , integrated over all black hole activity in a single merger event .",
    "this is not meant to suggest that this would constitute the entire accretion history of a black hole  a given black hole may have multiple `` lifetimes '' triggered by different mergers , with each merger in principle fueling a distinct `` quasar '' with its own lifetime .",
    "there is no a priori luminosity threshold for quasar activity  the time history can include various epochs at low luminosities and accretion rates .",
    "* we model the galaxy mergers using hydrodynamical simulations , varying the orbital parameters of the encounter , the internal properties of the merging galaxies , prescriptions for the gas physics , initial `` seed '' black hole masses of the merging systems , and numerical resolution of the simulations .",
    "the black hole accretion rate is determined from the surrounding gas ( smoothed over the scale of our spatial resolution , reaching @xmath21pc in the best cases ) , i.e.the density and sound speed of the gas , and its motion relative to the black hole , using eddington - limited , bondi - hoyle - lyttleton accretion theory .",
    "the black hole radiates with a canonical efficiency @xmath22 corresponding to a standard @xcite thin disk , and we assume that @xmath23 of this radiated luminosity is deposited as thermal energy into the surrounding gas , weighted by the sph smoothing kernel ( which has a @xmath24 profile ) over the scale of the spatial resolution .",
    "this scale is such that we can not resolve the complex accretion flow immediately around the black hole , but we adopt this prescription because : ( 1 ) it reproduces the observed slope and normalization in the @xmath25 relation ( di matteo et al.2005 ) , ( 2 ) it follows from observations , based on estimates of the energy contained in highly - absorbed uv portion of the quasar sed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , ( 3 ) it follows from theoretical considerations of momentum coupling to dust grains in the dense gas very near the quasar @xcite and hydrodynamical simulations of small - scale radiative heating from quasar accretion @xcite , and ( 4 ) even if the feedback is initially highly collimated , a driven wind or shock in a dense region such as the center of the merging galaxies will rapidly isotropize , so long as it is decelerated by gravity and the surrounding medium , allowing the high sound speed within the shock to equalize angle - dependent pressure variations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and furthermore initial local distortions will be washed away in favor of triaxial structure determined by the large - scale density gradients @xcite , as occurs in our simulations . * for each of our merger simulations , we compute the bolometric black hole luminosity and column density along @xmath26 lines of sight to the black hole(s ) ( evenly spaced in solid angle ) , as a function of time from the beginning of the simulation until the system has relaxed for @xmath27gyr after the merger .",

    "the final black hole mass ( black hole mass at the end of the individual merger ",

    "[ fig : tq.systematics ] , it is clear that the final black hole mass or peak luminosity is a better variable to use in describing the lifetime than the host galaxy mass .",
    "the lack of any systematic dependence of either the quasar lifetime or @xmath89(@xmath147 ) on host galaxy properties implies that our earlier results ( hopkins et al.2005a - d ) are reliable and can be applied to a wide range of host galaxy properties , redshifts , and luminosities , although we refine and expand the various fits of these works and their applications herein .",
    "furthermore , the large scatter in @xmath134  at a given galaxy mass has important implications for the quasar correlation function as a function of luminosity , as one can not associate a single quasar luminosity with hosts of a given mass ( see lidz et al .",

    "furthermore , in this regime , the fits above begin to differ significantly from those obtained by fitting e.g.  truncated power - laws or schechter functions .",
    "however , these luminosities are well below those we generally consider and well below the luminosities where the contribution of a quasar with some @xmath12 is significant to the observed quantities we predict . moreover , this turndown ( i.e.  the lower value predicted by an exponential as opposed to a power - law or schechter function at low luminosities ) is at least in part an artifact of the finite simulation duration .",
    "the values here are also significantly more uncertain , as by these low relative accretion rates , the system is likely to be accreting in some low - efficiency , adaf state ( e.g.  narayan & yi 1995 ) , which we do not implement directly in our simulations . rather than introduce additional uncertainties into our modeling when they do not affect our predictions , we adopt these exponential fits which are accurate at @xmath161 .",

    "this is a consequence of the fact that in our model quasar lifetimes decrease with increasing luminosity .",

    "a wide variety of `` light - bulb '' or exponential ( constant eddington ratio ) models are possible , allowing for different distributions of typical eddington ratios and/or quasar lifetimes ( see e.g.  steed & weinberg 2003 for an extensive comparison of several classes of such models ) , but for our purposes they are essentially identical insofar as they do not capture the essential qualitative features of our quasar lifetimes , namely that the quasar lifetime depends on both instantaneous and peak luminosities , and increases with decreasing instantaneous luminosity .",
    "we fit both of the simple models above to the observed quasar luminosity functions in the same manner described in   [ sec : lf ] , ( i.e.  in the same manner as we fit our more complicated models of quasar evolution ) , to determine @xmath209 for the `` light - bulb '' model and @xmath210 for the `` fixed eddington ratio '' model ( see equations  [ eqn : nlp.lb ] and [ eqn : nlp.edd ] , respectively ) .",
    "thus all three models of the quasar light curve , the `` light - bulb '' , `` fixed eddington ratio '' , and our luminosity - dependent lifetimes model produce an essentially identical bolometric luminosity function .",
    "we also consider two commonly adopted alternative models for the column density distribution and quasar obscuration :    _ `` standard ( luminosity - independent ) torus '' _",
    "( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is the canonical obscuration model , based on observations of local , low - luminosity seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the column density distribution is derived from the torus geometry , where we assume the torus inner radius lies at a distance @xmath211 from the black hole , with a height @xmath212 , and a density distribution @xmath213 plane .",
    "this results in a column density as a function of viewing angle of @xmath214 @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath215 is the column density along a line of sight through the torus in the equatorial plane and @xmath216 parameterizes the exponential decay of density with viewing angle .",
    "this is a phenomenological model , and as a result the parameters are essentially all free .",
    "we adopt typical values , an equatorial column density @xmath217@xmath218 , radius - to - height ratio @xmath219 , and density profile @xmath220 .",
    "this combination of parameters follows @xcite , and is designed to fit the observed x - ray column density distribution and give a ratio of obscured to unobscured quasars @xmath221 , similar to the mean locally observed value ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "_ `` receding ( luminosity - dependent ) torus '' _ ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "many observations suggest that the fraction of obscured objects depends on luminosity @xcite .",
    "therefore , some theoretical works have adopted a `` receding torus '' model , in which the torus radius @xmath211 ( i.e.  distance from the quasar ) is allowed to vary with luminosity , but the height and other parameters remain constant . the torus radius is assumed to increase with luminosity , enlarging the opening angle and thus the fraction of unobscured quasars . in this case , the column densities are identical to those shown above , but now @xmath222 , where @xmath223 is the luminosity at which the ratio of obscured to unobscured quasars is @xmath224 and the power - law slope is chosen to fit the dependence of obscured fraction on luminosity .",
    "both of these column density distributions represent phenomenological models with several free parameters , explicitly chosen to reproduce the observed differences in quasar luminosity functions and column density distributions . despite this",
    ", it is not clear that these functional forms represent the best possible fit to the observations they are designed to reproduce .",
    "furthermore , comparison of our results in which column density distributions depend on luminosity and peak luminosity elucidates the importance of proper modeling of the dependence of column density on quasar evolution .",
    "given quasar lifetimes as functions of both instantaneous and peak luminosities , the observed quasar luminosity function ( in the absence of selection effects ) is a convolution of the lifetime with the intrinsic distribution of sources with a given @xmath12 .",
    "if sources of a given @xmath13 are created at a rate @xmath225 ( per unit comoving volume ) at cosmological time @xmath226 and live for some lifetime @xmath227 , the total comoving number density observed will be @xmath228 which , for a cosmologically evolving @xmath229 , can be expanded about @xmath230 , yielding @xmath231 to first order in @xmath232 . considering a complete distribution of sources with some @xmath12 , we similarly obtain the luminosity function @xmath233 throughout , we will denote the differential luminosity function , i.e.the comoving number density of quasars in some logarithmic luminosity interval , as @xmath234 . here , @xmath235 is the comoving number density of sources created per unit cosmological time per logarithmic interval in @xmath124 , at some redshift , and @xmath149 is the differential quasar lifetime , i.e.  the total time that a quasar with a given @xmath12 spends in a logarithmic interval in bolometric luminosity @xmath13 .",
    "this formulation implicitly accounts for the `` duty cycle '' ( the fraction of active quasars at a given time ) , which is proportional to the lifetime at a given luminosity .",
    "corrections to this formula owing to finite lifetimes are of order @xmath236 , which for the luminosities and redshifts considered here ( except for figure  [ fig : lf.highz ] ) , are never larger than @xmath237 and are generally @xmath238 , which is significantly smaller than the uncertainty in the luminosity function itself .",
    "we next consider the implications of our luminosity - dependent quasar lifetimes for the relation between the observed luminosity function and the distribution of peak luminosities ( i.e.  intrinsic properties of quasar systems ) .",
    "in traditional models of quasar lifetimes and light curves , this relation is trivial .",
    "for example , models in which quasars `` turn on '' at fixed luminosity for some fixed lifetime ( i.e.  the `` light - bulb '' model defined in   [ sec : altmodels ] ) imply @xmath239 and models in which quasar light curves are a pure exponential growth or decay with some cutoff(s ) ( e.g. , exponential or fixed eddington - ratio models ) imply @xmath240 these both have essentially _ identical _ shape to the observed luminosity function , qualitatively different from our model prediction that @xmath36 should turn over at luminosities approximately below the break in the observed luminosity function ( see , e.g. fig . 1 of hopkins et al .",
    "the luminosity - dependent quasar lifetimes determined from our simulations imply a new interpretation of the luminosity function , with @xmath235 tracing the bright end of the luminosity function similar to traditional models , but then peaking and turning over below @xmath241 , the break luminosity in standard double power - law luminosity functions . in our deconvolution of the luminosity function , the faint end corresponds primarily to sources in sub - eddington phases transitioning into or out of the phase(s ) of peak quasar activity .",
    "there is also some contribution to the faint - end lifetime from quasars accreting efficiently ( i.e.  growing exponentially at high eddington ratio ) early in their activity and on their way to becoming brighter sources , but this becomes an increasingly small fraction of the lifetime at lower luminosities .",
    "for example , in figure 7 of hopkins et al .",
    "( 2005b ) , direct calculation of the quasar lifetime shows that sub - eddington phases begin to dominate the lifetime for @xmath242 , with @xmath243 of the lifetime at @xmath244 corresponding to sub - eddington growth . by definition ,",
    "a `` fixed eddington ratio '' or `` light bulb '' model is dominated at all luminosities by a fixed , usually large , eddington ratio .",
    "even models which assume an exponential decline in the quasar luminosity from some peak , although they clearly must spend a significant amount of time at low eddington ratios , have an identical @xmath245 ( modulo an arbitrary normalization ) , and predict far less time at most observable ( @xmath246 ) low luminosities and accretion rates ( because the accretion rates fall off so rapidly ) ; i.e.  the population at any observed luminosity is still dominated by objects near their peak .    from our new , large set of simulations , we test this model of the relationship between the distribution of peak quasar luminosities and observed luminosity functions , namely our assertion that @xmath36 should peak around the observed break in the luminosity function , and turn over below this peak , with the observed luminosity function faint - end slope dominated by sources with peak luminosities near the break in sub - eddington ( sub - peak luminosity ) states .",
    "in particular , we wish to ensure that this behavior for @xmath235 is real , and not some artifact of our fitting functions for the quasar lifetime .",
    "figure  [ fig : lf.hists ] shows the best fit @xmath235 distribution ( solid thick histogram ) fitted to the @xcite hard x - ray quasar luminosity function ( solid curve ) at redshift @xmath187 , as well as the resulting best - fit luminosity function ( solid thin histogram ) . for ease of comparison with other quasar luminosities , we rescale the luminosity function to the bolometric luminosity using the corrections of @xcite .",
    "we determine @xmath235 by logarithmically binning the range of @xmath12 , and considering for each bin all simulations with @xmath12 in the given range . for each bin , then , we take the average binned time the simulations spend in each luminosity interval , and take that to be the quasar lifetime @xmath149 .",
    "we then fit to the observed luminosity function of @xcite , fitting @xmath247 and allowing @xmath248 to be a free coefficient for each binned @xmath249 . despite our large number of simulations ,",
    "the numerical binning process makes this result noisy , especially at the extreme ends of the luminosity function .",
    "however , the relevant result is clear  the qualitative behavior of @xmath235 described above is unchanged .",
    "for further discussion of the qualitative differences between the @xmath235 distribution from different quasar models , and the robust nature of our interpretation even under restrictive assumptions ( e.g.  ignoring the early phases of merger activity or applying various models for radiative efficiency as a function of accretion rate ) , we refer to @xcite .      given a distribution of peak luminosities @xmath235",
    ", we can use our model of quasar lifetimes and the column density distribution as a function of instantaneous and peak luminosities to predict the luminosity function at any frequency . from a distribution of @xmath89  values and",
    "some a priori known minimum observed luminosity @xmath250 , the fraction @xmath251 of quasars with a peak luminosity @xmath252 and instantaneous bolometric luminosity @xmath13 which lie above the luminosity threshold is given by the fraction of @xmath89  values below a critical @xmath253 , where @xmath254 .",
    "here , @xmath255 is a bolometric correction and @xmath256 is the cross - section at frequency @xmath257 .",

    "based on the direct fit for @xmath235 in figure  [ fig : lf.hists ] , we wish to consider a functional form for @xmath235 with a well - defined peak and falloff in either direction in @xmath262 .",

    "we note that although this choice of fitting function has appropriate general qualities , it is ultimately somewhat arbitrary , and we choose it primarily for its simplicity and its capacity to match the data with a minimum of free parameters .",

    "the `` true '' @xmath235 will , of course , be a complicated function of both halo merger rates at a given redshift and the distribution of host galaxy properties including , but not necessarily limited to , masses , concentrations , and gas fractions .",
    "having chosen a form for @xmath235 , we can then fit to an observed luminosity function to determine @xmath272 .",

    "thus , we fit each luminosity function in all redshift intervals for which we have binned data .",
    "we find good fits ( @xmath277 ) to all luminosity functions at all redshifts with a pure peak - luminosity evolution ( pple ) model , for which @xmath278 where @xmath279 is the fractional lookback time ( @xmath280 ) and @xmath281 is a dimensionless constant fitted with @xmath282 .",
    "it is important to distinguish this from `` standard '' pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as with @xmath283 and @xmath284 always , the density of sources , especially as a function of observed luminosity at some frequency , evolves in a non - trivial manner .",
    "we do not find significant improvement in the fits if we additionally allow @xmath264 or @xmath266 to evolve with redshift ( @xmath285 , depending on the adopted form for the evolution ) , and therefore consider only the simplest parameterization above ( equation  [ eqn : param.evol ] ) .",
    "we also find acceptable fits for a pure density evolution model , with @xmath286constant and @xmath287 ( both keeping @xmath266 fixed and allowing it to evolve as well ) .",

    "although our prediction falls below the observed seyfert luminosity function at fainter magnitudes , there is no reason to believe that mergers should be responsible for all nuclear activity at these luminosities ( and indeed alternative fueling mechanisms for such faint objects likely exist ) - it is surprising , in fact , that this picture reproduces the observed agn activity to such faint luminosities .    using the bolometric corrections of @xcite instead of @xcite results in a significantly steeper cutoff in the luminosity function at high bolometric luminosities , as the bolometric luminosity inferred for the",
    "brightest observed x - ray quasars is almost an order of magnitude smaller using the @xcite corrections .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent comparisons between large samples of quasars selected by both optical and x - ray surveys @xcite further suggests that this is an intrinsic correlation , not driven by e.g.  the dependence of obscuration on luminosity . for a direct comparison of the bolometric luminosity functions resulting from the two corrections , we refer to @xcite .",
    "our analysis uses the form for the uv to x - ray flux ratio , @xmath305 , from @xcite , but our results are relatively insensitive to the different values found in the literature .",
    "it is important to account for this dependence , as it creates a significant difference in the high - luminosity end of the bolometric quasar luminosity function and implies that a non - negligible fraction of the brightest quasars are not seen in optical surveys ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",

    ". however , some quantities , in particular the high - mass end of the black hole mass function ( see   [ sec : smbh ] ) , which is dominated by the small number of the brightest quasars at high redshifts , can receive large relative contributions from these terms .",
    "therefore , it is important in estimating these quantities to be aware of the turnover in the quasar density at high redshifts .    we quantify this in figure  [ fig : lf.highz ] , where we show the predicted broad - line luminosity function ( where the broad - line phase is determined below in   [ sec : smbh ] ) in six luminosity intervals from @xmath311 .",
    "the intervals are those of the combo-17 luminosity function from @xcite , but we further compare to the observed luminosity functions of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite at the appropriate ( labeled ) redshifts . at each redshift @xmath312 , we take the fitted @xmath36 distribution above ( equations  [ eqn : nlp.lognorm],[eqn : param.evol ] ) and rescale it according to an exponential cutoff : either pure density evolution ( pde ) , @xmath313 , or pure peak luminosity evolution ( pple ) , @xmath314 .",

    "furthermore , the predicted luminosity function should be considered uncertain especially at low luminosities , as the quasar lifetime at these luminosities and redshifts can become comparable to the age of the universe , at which point our formalism for the luminosity function as a function of @xmath36 becomes inaccurate .",
    "however , we are able to make testable predictions , based on differences between the two models in integrated _ galaxy _ properties ( for example , color - magnitude diagrams of red sequence galaxies at low masses or the fraction of recently formed spheroids as a function of mass and redshift ) , which distinguish the pple and pde models for the evolution of the quasar luminosity function at @xmath307 @xcite . owing to these degeneracies and the poor constraints on the observed high - redshift luminosity functions ,",
    "we have not considered them ( those at @xmath319 ) in our fits to @xmath36 , but use them here to roughly constrain the turnover in the quasar density above @xmath309 ( i.e.  fitting to @xmath320 and @xmath321 ) . which form of the turnover we use makes little difference in our subsequent analysis , but ,",
    "as discussed above , including _ some _ turnover is important in calculating select quantities such as the extreme high - mass end of the black hole mass function .      given the column density distributions and quasar lifetimes calculated from our simulations in ",

    "the observationally implied @xmath325 distribution is determined from fitting to the distribution of photometric reddening in all sdss bands ( i.e.  using the five - band photometry as a proxy for spectral fitting ) in sloan quasars , relative to the modal quasar colors at each redshift , for quasars with an absolute magnitude limit @xmath328 .",
    "the @xmath329-band absolute magnitude limit imposed in the observed sample , @xmath328 , corresponds approximately to our plotted b - band limit @xmath330 .",

    "however , this effect would only serve to bring our distribution into better agreement with observations , as it would slightly lower the high-@xmath88  tail .",
    "we also consider the predictions of a standard torus model and receding ( luminosity - dependent ) torus model in the figure ( dashed and dotted lines , respectively ) . these should not be taken literally in this case",
    " they reflect that these phenomenological models do not predict the distribution of low / moderate column densities , but rather assume that all lines of sight not intersecting the torus are `` unobscured , '' and encounter some constant , small column density ( usually chosen to be @xmath331 ) .",
    "the right panel of [ fig : nh.distrib ] shows the integrated distribution ( in @xmath332 ) for a complete hard x - ray sample , both as predicted from our simulations based on the joint distribution of column density , luminosity , and peak luminosity ( solid ) , and for both the standard torus model ( dashed ) and receding torus model ( dotted ) described in ",
    "[ sec : altmodels ] .",
    "the data shown are the results of @xcite ( blue squares ) and @xcite ( red circles ) , with assumed poisson errors , from multiband _ chandra _ and _ hst _ observations of goods fields .",
    "the solid squares are obtained by assuming an intrinsic photon index for the soft x - ray quasar spectrum of @xmath333 , the open squares assuming @xmath334 . for the sake of direct comparison with observed distributions , objects with @xmath335 , for which only an upper limit to the column density would be determined in x - ray observations , are grouped together and plotted as a single bin at @xmath336 .",
    "the actual distribution below @xmath337 is shown as a dot - dashed line .",
    "we note that our model of the quasar spectrum assumes a photon index @xmath333 in the soft x - ray , but this has no effect on the column densities calculated from the surrounding gas in our simulations .",
    "the agreement between the observed column density distribution and the result of our simulations once the same selection effect is applied supports our model for quasar evolution , and the good agreement extends to both optical and x - ray samples . probing to fainter luminosities or frequencies less affected by attenuation broadens the column density distribution , as is seen from the inferred column density distributions in the x - ray .",
    "this broadening occurs because , at lower luminosities , observers will see both intrinsically bright periods extinguished by larger column densities ( broadening the distribution to larger @xmath89  values ) and intrinsically faint periods with small column densities ( broadening the distribution to smaller @xmath89  values ) . the distribution as a function of reference luminosity is a natural consequence of the dynamics of the quasar activity . throughout much of the duration of bright quasar activity",
    ", column densities rise to high levels as a result of the same process that feeds accretion , producing the well - known reddened population of quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , extending to bright quasars strongly reddened by large @xmath88 .",
    "furthermore , a significant number of quasars are extinguished from optical samples or attenuated to lower luminosities , giving rise to the distinction between luminosity functions in the hard x - ray , soft x - ray , and optical .    the standard torus model described in   [ sec : altmodels ] ,",
    "although unable to predict the distribution of column densities seen in optically , relatively unobscured quasars , does a fair job of reproducing the observed distribution of x - ray column densities .",
    "the parameters of the model are , of course , chosen to reproduce the data shown ( the model parameters are taken from * ? ? ?",
    ". nevertheless , our prediction is still a better fit to the observed distribution , with @xmath338 as opposed to @xmath339 ( although the absolute values depend on the estimated systematic errors in the column density estimations ) .",
    "the receding torus model fares even more poorly in reproducing the observed column density distributions , and is ruled out at high significance ( @xmath340 ) , although this can be alleviated if the observed samples are assumed to be incomplete above @xmath341 .",
    "this disagreement results because , in order to match the observed scaling of broad - line fraction with luminosity ( see   [ sec : blqso ] below ) , this model assumes a larger covering fraction for the torus at lower luminosities , normalized to a similar obscured fraction as the standard torus model near the break in the observed quasar luminosity function .",
    "however , since quasars with luminosities below the break dominate the total number counts , this predicts that the cumulative column density distribution must be significantly more dominated by objects with large covering angles , giving a larger compton - thick population , inconsistent with the actual observed column density distribution .",
    "although we do not see a significant fraction of extremely compton - thick column densities @xmath342 in the distributions from our simulations , our model does not rule out such values .",
    "it is possible that bright quasars in unusually massive galaxies or quasars in higher - redshift , compact galaxies which we have not simulated may , during peak accretion periods , reach such values in their typical column densities .",
    "moreover , as our model assumes @xmath343 of the mass of the densest gas is clumped into cold - phase molecular clouds , a small fraction of sightlines will pass through such clouds and measure column densities similar to those shown for the `` cold phase gas '' in , e.g.  figure 2 of @xcite , @xmath344 .",
    "furthermore , we have not determined the `` shape '' at any instant of the obscuration ( e.g.  the dependence of obscuration on radial direction ) , as in practice , for most of the most strongly obscured phases in peak merger activity , the central regions of the merging galaxies are highly chaotic .",
    "generally , the scale of the obscuration in the peak merger phases is @xmath345pc , quite different than that implied by most traditional molecular torus models , but we note that our resolution limits , @xmath346pc in the dense central regions of the merger , prevent our ruling out collapse of gas in the central regions into a smaller but more dense torus .",
    "however , several efforts to model traditional tori through radiative transfer simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest significant column densities produced on scales of @xmath347pc , comparable to our predictions , and we note that only the solid angle covered by a torus , not the absolute torus scale , is constrained in the typical phenomenological torus model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    whether the obscuration of bright quasars originates on larger scales than is generally assumed is observationally testable , either through direct probes of polarized scattered light tracing the obscuring / reflecting structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or through correlations between obscuration and e.g.  host galaxy morphologies and inclinations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these larger scales typical of the central regions of a galaxy are widely accepted as the scales of obscuration in starbursting systems ( e.g.  soifer et al .",
    "1984a , b ; sanders et al .  1986 , 1988a , b ; for a review , see e.g.soifer et al .",
    "1987 ) , which in our modeling is associated with rapid obscured quasar growth and precedes the quasar phase .",
    "thus , it is natural to associate obscuration with these large scales in any picture which associates starbursts and rapid black hole growth or quasar activity , as opposed to the smaller scales @xmath348pc implied by torus models primarily developed to reproduce observations of quiescent , low - luminosity type ii agn , which are usually not directly associated with merger activity .",
    "these low - luminosity agn are in a relaxed state , suggesting the possibility that the remaining cold gas in the central regions of our merger remnants will collapse once the violent effects of the merger and bright quasar phase have passed , producing a more traditional small torus in a quiescent nucleus .",
    "the central point is that regardless of the form of obscuration , the typical magnitude of the obscuration is a strongly evolving function of time , luminosity , and host system properties , and the observed column density distributions reflect this evolution .",
    "optical samples typically identify quasars through their colors , relying on the characteristic non - stellar power - law continua of such objects .",
    "however , observations of x - ray selected agn show a large population of so - called type 2 agn , most of which have seyfert - like luminosities and typical spectra in x - rays and wavelengths longward of @xmath349 m ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but are optically obscured to the point where no broad lines are visible .",
    "their optical continua , in other words , resemble those of typical galaxies and thus they are not identified by conventional color selection techniques in optical quasar surveys .",
    "traditional unification models @xcite have postulated a static torus as the explanation for the existence of the type 2 population , with such objects viewed through the dusty torus and thus optically obscured .",
    "moreover , both synthesis models of the x - ray background @xcite and recent direct observations in large surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate the existence of a population of type 2 quasars , with similar obscuration but intrinsic ( unobscured ) quasar - like luminosities .",
    "observations of both radio - loud @xcite and radio - quiet @xcite quasars , however , have shown that the broad - line fraction increases with luminosity , with broad - line objects representing a large fraction of all agn at luminosities above the `` break '' in the luminosity function and rapidly falling off at luminosities below the break .",
    "modifications to the standard torus unification model explain this via a luminosity - dependent inner torus radius @xcite , but this represents a tunable modification to a purely phenomenological model .",
    "furthermore , as the observations have improved , it has become clear that even these luminosity - dependent torus models can not produce acceptable fits to the broad line fraction as a function of luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , we have shown above that the obscuring column , even at a given luminosity , is an evolutionary effect , dominated by different stages of gas inflow in different merging systems giving rise to varying typical column densities , rather than a single static structure .",
    "it is of interest , then , to calculate when quasars will be observed as broad - line objects , and to compare this with observations of broad line quasars and their population as a function of luminosity .    figure  [ fig : bl.in.sims ] shows the b - band luminosity as a function of time for both the quasars and host galaxies in three representative simulations : the a2 , a3 , and a5 cases described in detail in   [ sec : sims ] .",
    "these simulations each have @xmath350 , with virial velocities @xmath351 , with resulting final black hole masses @xmath352 , respectively .",
    "the thick line in each case shows the quasar b - band luminosity , and the thin line shows the integrated b - band luminosity of all stars in the galaxy .",
    "new stars are formed self - consistently in the simulations according to the ism gas properties , equation of state and star formation model described in @xcite , with the age and metallicity taken from the local star - forming ism gas , which is enriched by supernova feedback from previous star formation .",
    "we then use the stellar population synthesis model of @xcite to determine the b - band luminosity ( the b - band mass - to - light ratio ) of new stars based on the stellar age and metallicity .",
    "the dotted line shows the result neglecting bulge particles , which must be initialized at the beginning of the simulation with random or uniform ages and metallicities instead of those quantities being determined self - consistently from the simulation physics .",
    "the right panels plot the intrinsic values of these quantities , and the left panels plot the median observed values of these quantities , where we have used our method for determining column densities and dust attenuation (   [ sec : nh ] ) to every star and bulge particle for each line of sight .",
    "unfortunately , the host galaxy luminosity does _ not _ scale with instantaneous and peak quasar luminosity as do , for example , the quasar lifetime and obscuration .",
    "rather , there are important systematic dependencies , the largest of which is the dependence on host galaxy gas fraction . if the host galaxies are more massive , more concentrated , or have a weaker ism equation of state pressurization , then they will more effectively drive gas into the central regions and maintain high gas densities for longer periods of time , as the deeper potential well or lack of gas pressure requires more heat input from the quasar before the gas can be expelled . these conditions will generally produce a quasar with a larger peak luminosity ( final black hole mass ) , but also form more new stars , meaning that the b - band relation between host and quasar luminosity is roughly preserved",
    ".    however , the the black hole consumes only a small fraction of the available gas ( comparison of e.g.  the stellar mass and black hole mass suggests the black hole consumes @xmath353 of the gas mass ) , and so , at least above some threshold @xmath354 , the quasar peak luminosity does not significantly depend on the galaxy gas fraction ( see , e.g.  figure 2 of robertson et al .",
    "but , the mass of new stars formed _ during _ the merger does strongly depend on the available gas . for example ,",
    "simulations which are otherwise identical but have initial @xmath355 ( i.e.  an increasing fraction of the initial disk mass in gas instead of stars ) produce similar peak quasar luminosity and final total stellar mass ( within @xmath356 of one another ) , reflecting the conversion of most gas into stars and the fact that the peak quasar luminosity is determined more by the depth of the potential well than the total available gas supply .",
    "but , the mass of _ new _ stars formed in a merger scales roughly as @xmath357 ( as it must if the initial gas fraction does not change the final total stellar mass ) , and since young stellar populations dominate the observed b - band luminosity ( especially during the peak merger and starburst phases associated with the bright quasar phase of interest ) , this implies roughly that @xmath358 .",
    "we demonstrate this explicitly in figure  [ fig : bl.in.sims ] , where we show in each panel the host galaxy and stellar b - band light curves for otherwise identical simulations with different gas fractions , @xmath359 . in each of these cases ,",
    "the quasar light curve is nearly identical ( we show only the @xmath360 quasar lightcurve , for clarity , but the others are within @xmath356 of the curve shown at most times , with no systematic offset ) .    in order for a quasar to be classified as a `` broad - line '' object , the optical spectrum must be visible and identified as such in the observed sample .",
    "this is clearly related to the ratio of quasar to host galaxy luminosity , but the threshold for classification is not obvious . in an x - ray or ir - selected sample , optical follow - up should be able to disentangle host galaxy light and identify quasar broad - line spectra with fluxes a factor of several fainter than the host .",
    "however , automated optical selection based on color or morphological criteria might well exclude objects unless the quasar luminosity is a factor of several greater than that of the host galaxy .",
    "therefore , there is significant systematic uncertainty in the theoretical definition of a broad - line quasar . to first order , based on the above arguments",
    ", we can classify `` broad - line quasars '' as objects in which the quasar optical luminosity is larger than some multiple @xmath361 of the host galaxy optical luminosity . because the relevant ratio is different depending on the survey and selection techniques , we consider the range @xmath362 , with a rough median @xmath363 . furthermore , because our simulations do not allow us to model the broad - line regions of the quasar or spectral line structures as influenced by e.g.  reddening and dust absorption , we adopt the b - band luminosity of the quasar and host galaxy as a proxy for optical luminosity and more complex ( but often quite sample - specific ) color and morphological selection criteria .    in figure  [",
    "fig : bl.in.sims ] , the b - band host galaxy luminosity is quite flat as a function of time , relative to the quasar b - band luminosity , and is roughly given by @xmath364 , where @xmath365 is the mass of new stars formed in the merger .",
    "as noted above , this scales approximately linearly with initial gas fraction at fixed final total stellar mass @xmath366 , giving @xmath367 , where @xmath368 is a correction of order unity which we can fit from the simulations ( essentially a mean mass - to - light ratio for the newly formed stars ) .",
    "the bolometric correction of the quasar is usually defined by @xmath369 , and the quasar peak luminosity is @xmath370 , where again @xmath371 is a correction factor of order unity which we can calculate from our form for the quasar lifetime ( see equation  [ eq : mbhf ] ) or measure in the simulations .",
    "if we require that the quasar b - band luminosity be larger than a factor @xmath361 of the host galaxy b - band luminosity , we obtain @xmath372 dividing this through by @xmath12 , we have @xmath373 we can test this scaling relation against the results of our simulations , and do so in figure  [ fig : test.bl ] . rearranging the equations above",
    "gives @xmath374 which we can compare to our direct calculation of @xmath375 and @xmath376 for each simulation snapshot .",
    "ultimately , we are not interested so much in the intrinsic b - band luminosity of the quasar and host galaxy , but rather the observed luminosities ; i.e.  we are interested in the ratio @xmath377 , where @xmath378 and @xmath379 are `` effective '' optical depths which we use to denote the mean attenuation of quasar and host galaxy b - band luminosities , respectively .",
    "we have considered the distribution of column densities attenuating the quasar as a function of instantaneous and peak quasar luminosity in detail in   [ sec : nhfunction ] above ; the attenuation of the host galaxy as a function of luminosity , observed band , halo mass , and star formation rate are discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "combining these fits gives , roughly , @xmath380 , but a better approximation can be determined directly from the simulations .",
    "this scaling can be understood roughly using toy models of uniformly mixed luminous sources within the galaxy described by @xcite , after accounting for the fact that the luminosity ( star formation rate ) dependent portion of the attenuation scales with luminosity in a similar manner to our quasar attenuation ( compare our @xmath381 to their @xmath382 ) .",
    "the key consequence of this is that more massive systems ( higher bulge and black hole masses ) have their host galaxy light proportionally more attenuated in mergers , meaning that ( as suggested by the comparison of light curves in figure  [ fig : bl.in.sims ] ) the quasar is more likely to be observed with an optical luminosity larger than that of its host .",
    "figure  [ fig : test.bl ] plots the ratio of the observed ( attenuated ) b - band quasar luminosity to the observed host galaxy b - band luminosity as a function of the ratio of instantaneous to peak quasar bolometric luminosity .",
    "we show the results for four different gas fractions @xmath383 as labeled . for each gas fraction , we consider our simulations a2 ( black diamonds ) , a3 ( blue circles ) , and a5 ( red @xmath384 s ) ( the same simulations shown in figure  [ fig : bl.in.sims ] ) with @xmath385 , and virial velocities @xmath386 , using the labeled initial gas fraction .",
    "the colored lines in each panel show the predictions of combining the scalings expected for the intrinsic luminosities ( equation  [ eqn : bl.predict ] ) and attenuations as above , giving @xmath387 where the colored lines each use the @xmath33 and @xmath144 of the simulation of the corresponding color and panel .",
    "this scaling provides a good estimate of the observed optical quasar - to - galaxy luminosity ratio , including the complicated effects of attenuation , evolving mass - to - light ratios , metallicities , and host galaxy properties , as a function of gas fraction , final black hole mass , and the ratio of the current to peak quasar luminosity .",
    "although , for clarity , we have not shown a range of simulations varying other parameters , we find that this scaling is robust to the large number of quantities we have considered in our simulations  there are systematic offsets in e.g.  @xmath12 and @xmath33 with changes such as e.g.  different ism equations of state , but the scaling in terms of @xmath12 and @xmath33 is unchanged .    because the ratio of observed quasar and host galaxy b - band luminosities in our simulations obeys the scaling of equation  [ eqn : bl.scaling ] , we can use it to predict the properties of `` broad - line '' quasars , defined by @xmath388 .",
    "to do so , however , we must assume a typical host galaxy gas fraction .",
    "unfortunately , because our empirical modeling in terms of the quasar lifetime as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath12 does not have a systematic dependence on host galaxy gas fraction ( see   [ sec : detailscompare ] ) , we have no constraint on this parameter .",
    "it is , however , convenient for several reasons to consider @xmath389 as a typical value for bright quasars .",
    "first , such a gas fraction is capable of yielding the brightest observed quasars ; second , scaling a milky - way like disk with the observed @xmath390 gas fraction @xmath391 to the redshifts of peak quasar activity gives a similar gas fraction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; third , gas fractions @xmath392 in major mergers are needed to explain the observed fundamental plane ( robertson et al .  2005c , in preparation ) , kinematic properties ( cox et al .  2005c , in preparation ) , and central phase space densities ( hernquist , spergel & heyl 1993 ) of elliptical galaxies ; fourth , this choice implies that the brightest quasars with @xmath393 attain observed b - band luminosities @xmath26 times that of their hosts at their peaks , as is observed ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ) . finally , and most important ,",
    "the assumed @xmath144 and @xmath361 are degenerate in our predictions for the broad - line population , as they both enter linearly in the ratio of host galaxy to quasar b - band luminosity .",
    "therefore , the range of @xmath394 which we consider ( for a fixed median @xmath389 ) can be equivalently considered , for a fixed median @xmath363 , to represent a theoretical uncertainty in the host galaxy gas fraction , @xmath395 ; i.e.  spanning the range from present , relatively gas - poor milky - way like disks to almost completely gaseous disks .",
    "this , then , gives for our `` broad - line '' criterion , @xmath396    the `` broad - line '' phase is thus , as is clear from figure  [ fig : bl.in.sims ] and implicit in our definition of the broad - line phase , closely associated with the final `` blowout '' stages of quasar evolution , when the mass of the quasar reaches that corresponding to its location on the @xmath25 relation and gas is expelled from the central regions of the galaxy , shutting down accretion @xcite .",
    "we note that combining the equation above with our fitted quasar lifetimes gives an integrated time when the quasar would be observable as a broad line object of @xmath397myr , in good agreement with the optically observable bright quasar lifetimes we calculate directly from our quasar light curves , including the effects of attenuation , and with empirical estimates of the quasar lifetime which are based directly on optically - selected , broad - line quasar samples .    the @xmath398 term in the above equation reflects the fact that , below a certain peak luminosity , quasars are less likely to reach luminosities above that of the host galaxy , as can be seen in the uppermost panels of figure  [ fig : bl.in.sims ] for a final black hole mass of @xmath399 ",
    "i.e.  the smallest agn are proportionally less optically luminous than their hosts .",
    "this does not imply that such systems are not inherently broad - line objects , but only that the host galaxy light will increasingly dominate at lower luminosities .",
    "we also caution against extrapolating this to large or small @xmath33 , as the attenuation becomes more difficult to predict at these peak luminosities , and the linear formula above is not always accurate ( see figure  [ fig : test.bl ] ) .",
    "we can use this estimate of the broad - line phase and our model of the quasar lifetime to calculate the total energy radiated in this bright , optically observable stage following the calculation of   [ sec : detailscompare ] , but with a minimum luminosity determined by equation  [ eqn : bl.min ] .",
    "this gives an integrated fraction @xmath400 ( @xmath401 ) of the total radiant energy emitted during the broad - line phase .",
    "thus , despite the short duration of this optical quasar stage , a large fraction of the total radiated energy is emitted ( as it represents the final @xmath5-folding in the growth of the black hole ) when most of the final black hole mass (   [ sec : detailscompare ] ) is accumulated .",
    "accounting for the luminosity dependence of our bolometric corrections ( with the optical fraction of the quasar energy increasing with bolometric luminosity ) as well as the small fraction of objects observable at lower luminosities ( with larger typical obscuring column densities ) increases this fraction to as much as @xmath402 for bright quasars . therefore , despite the fact that the _ duration _ of the optically observable broad - line quasar phase may be @xmath403 that of the obscured quasar growth phase , the changing quasar luminosity over this period and non - trivial quasar lifetime as a function of luminosity implies only small corrections to counting arguments such as that of @xcite , which rely on the total observed optical quasar flux density to estimate the relic supermassive black hole density .      by estimating the time that a quasar with some @xmath12 will be observable as a broad - line quasar at a given luminosity",
    ", we can then calculate the broad - line quasar luminosity function in the same fashion as the complete quasar luminosity function in   [ sec : fulllf ] . instead of the full quasar lifetime @xmath149",
    ", we consider only the time during which broad - lines would be observed ( i.e.  that the quasar spectrum would be recognized as opposed to the host galaxy spectrum ) , as identified in our simulations (   [ sec : whenbl ] ) .",
    "for a sample selected in hard x - rays ( i.e.  the selection function only being relevant at column densities @xmath404 ) , we show the resulting `` broad - line '' luminosity function in figure  [ fig : lf.all ] ( cyan dot - dashed lines ) , and compare it to the broad - line quasar luminosity function identified in the hard x - ray luminosity function of @xcite .",
    "the agreement is good at all luminosities , and our model explains both the fact that broad - line quasars dominate the luminosity function at luminosities well above the `` break '' in the luminosity function , and the downturn in the broad - line quasar population at luminosities below the peak . essentially , the broad - line quasar population more closely traces the shape of the @xmath235 distribution , giving rise to the observed behavior as a dual consequence of luminosity - dependent quasar lifetimes and the evolutionary nature of quasar obscuration in our simulations .",

    "open squares correspond to bins in luminosity which have been corrected for incompleteness following @xcite , but this correction is uncertain as the bins are not uniformly sampled . we compare this at each redshift to the prediction of our determination of the quasar `` broad - line '' phase , where we estimate that the quasar is observable as a broad line object when its observed b - band luminosity is greater than a factor @xmath406 of that of the host galaxy .",
    "we calculate this for both the minimum and maximum observed redshift of each bin to show the range owing to evolution of the luminosity function over each interval in redshift .",
    "the systematic uncertainty in our prediction can be estimated from the dotted lines , which show the prediction ( at the mean redshift of the bin ) if we instead require the observed quasar b - band luminosity to be above a factor of 0.3 ( upper lines ) or 3 ( lower lines ) of the observed host galaxy b - band luminosity , which as discussed in ",

    "the difference between different choices of @xmath144 is suppressed at the high luminosity ( and correspondingly high redshift ) end of the luminosity function , because the quasar - to - galaxy b - band luminosity ratio scales as @xmath409 ; i.e.  regardless of the choice of @xmath361 , quasars increasingly overwhelm their host galaxy in large systems near their peak luminosity . however , at low luminosity , the predictions rapidly diverge , implying that a measurement of the faint end of the broad - line quasar luminosity function , with a reliable calibration of @xmath361 , can constrain the typical gas fractions of quasar host galaxies and the evolution of these gas fractions with redshift .    by dividing out the predicted luminosity function @xmath273 , we can estimate the fraction of `` broad line '' objects observed in reasonably complete x - ray samples as a function of luminosity .",

    "furthermore , the solid cyan line shows the best - fit luminosity - dependent torus model , in which the broad line fraction is given by ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath419 where @xmath420 is the luminosity where the number of broad line objects is equal to the number of non - broad line objects .",
    "this fit is at best marginally acceptable over a narrow range in luminosities ( @xmath421 ) .",
    "modified luminosity - dependent , receding torus models have been proposed which give a better fit to the data by , for example , allowing the torus height to vary with luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but there is no physical motivation for these changes , and they introduce such variation through additional free parameters that allow a curve of essentially arbitrary slope to be fitted to the data .    however , the prediction of our model agrees reasonably well ( @xmath422 ) with the observations over the entire range covered , a span of six orders of magnitude in luminosity .",
    "we emphasize that our prediction , which matches the data better than standard torus models that are actually _ fitted _ to the data , is not a fit to the observations .",
    "instead , it is derived from the physics of our simulations , including black hole accretion and feedback which are critical in driving the `` blowout '' phase which constitutes most of the time a quasar is visible as a `` broad - line '' object by our estimation , and from the @xmath423 distribution implied by our model of quasar lifetimes and the _ bolometric _ quasar luminosity function .",
    "the agreement suggests that our choice of the parameter combination @xmath424 is a good approximation .",
    "as noted above , this implies that calibrating @xmath361 for an observed sample , combined with the mean broad - line fraction and our modeling , can provide a constraint ( albeit model - dependent ) on the host galaxy gas fraction of quasars at a given redshift , which can not necessarily be directly measured even with difficult , detailed host galaxy probes , as gas is rapidly converted into stars throughout the merger . the uncertainty plotted , while large , actually represents a larger theoretical uncertainty  as discussed above , if an observational sample were well - defined such that it were complete to broad - line objects with observed optical luminosity above a fraction @xmath361 of the host galaxy luminosity , the range we consider would correspond to a range @xmath395 in the quasar host galaxy gas fraction , which the observations could then constrain .    in our modeling , the broad line fraction as a function of luminosity",
    "does not depend sensitively on the observed luminosity function , as evidenced by the relatively similar prediction at high redshift .",
    "the evolution we do predict with redshift , in fact , agrees well with that found by @xcite over the redshift range @xmath425 ( see also la franca et al .",
    "2005 ) , an aspect of the observations which is not reproduced in any static or luminosity - dependent torus model but follows from the evolution of the quasar luminosity function in our picture for quasar growth . however , we do caution that gas fractions may systematically evolve with redshift , and as discussed above , a higher gas fraction will give generally shorter `` broad - line '' lifetimes using our criteria of quasar optical luminosity being higher than some fraction of the host galaxy luminosity , which will also contribute to the evolution in the mean `` broad - line '' fraction with redshift .",
    "finally , neglecting the role of luminosity - dependent quasar lifetimes gives unacceptable fits to the data ( @xmath426 ) , as the broad - line fraction as a function of luminosity is a consequence of both the evolution of obscuration and the dependence of lifetime on luminosity .",
    "our model for quasar evolution provides a direct physical motivation for the change in broad line fraction with luminosity and suggests that it is not a complicated selection effect . as an observational sample considers higher luminosities ( i.e.  approaches and passes the `` break '' in the observed luminosity function ) , a comparison of the luminosity function and the underlying @xmath36 shows that it is increasingly dominated by sources near their peak luminosity in the final stages of eddington limited growth .",
    "the final stages of this growth expel the large gas densities obscuring the quasar , rendering it a bright , optically observable broad - line object for a short time .",
    "therefore , we expect that the fraction of broad - line objects should increase with luminosity in quasar samples , as indicated by the observations",
    ".    many observational measures do not consider a direct optical analysis of the quasar spectrum in estimating the fraction of broad - line objects as a function of luminosity .",
    "for example , @xcite adopt a proxy , classifying as `` obscured '' any quasars with an x - ray identified column density @xmath427 , and as `` unobscured '' quasars below this column density .",
    "we can compare to their observations , using the column density distributions as a function of luminosity from our simulations , which cover the entire range in luminosity of the observed sample .",
    "specifically , we use a monte carlo realization of these distributions , employing our fitted @xmath36 distribution at each redshift to produce a list of quasar peak luminosities and then generating all other properties based on the probability distribution of a given property in simulations with a similar peak luminosity .",
    "we describe this methodology in detail in   [ sec : discussion ] , and provide several such mock quasar distributions at different redshifts .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ueda.bl ] , we compare our estimated `` obscured '' and `` unobscured '' fractions as a function of hard x - ray luminosity , using the same definitions as well as redshift and luminosity limits as the observed sample .",
    "the solid line shows our prediction , with vertical error bars representing poisson errors , where the number of `` counts '' is proportional to the total time spent by simulations at the plotted luminosity ( the absolute value of these errors should not be taken seriously ) .",
    "the `` obscured '' fraction is determined in bins of luminosity @xmath428 . despite our large number of simulations ,",
    "there is still some artificial `` noise '' owing to incomplete coverage of the merger parameter space , namely the apparent oscillations in the obscured fraction .",
    "however , the mean trend agrees well with that observed ( black squares ) , suggesting that the success of our modeling in reproducing the fraction of `` broad line '' objects as a function of luminosity is not a consequence of the definitions chosen above .",
    "we do not show the predictions of the standard and luminosity - dependent torus models , as ( because essentially any line of sight through the torus encounters a column density @xmath427 ) the predictions of these models are identical to those shown and compared to the same observations in figure  [ fig : bl.fraction ] .",
    "our prediction that the fraction of broad - line objects should rise with increasing luminosity is counterintuitive , given our fitted column density distributions in which typical ( median ) column densities increase with increasing luminosity .",
    "this primarily owes to the simplicity of our @xmath89  fits ; we assume the distribution is lognormal at all times , but a detailed inspection of the cumulative ( time - integrated ) column density distribution shows that at bright ( near - peak ) luminosities , the distribution is in fact bimodal ( see e.g.  figure 3 of hopkins et al .",
    "2005b and figure 2 of hopkins et al .",
    "2005d ) , representing both the heavily obscured growth phase and the `` blowout '' phase we have identified here as the `` broad line '' phase . over most of a simulation ,",
    "we find the general trend shown in figure  [ fig : nh.systematics ] and discussed above , namely that typical column densities increase with intrinsic ( unobscured ) luminosity .",
    "this is because the total time at moderate to large luminosities is dominated by black holes growing in the obscured / starburst stages ; here , the same gas inflows fueling black hole growth also give rise to large column densities and starbursts which obscure the black hole activity .",
    "however , when the quasar nears its final , peak luminosity , there is a rapid `` blowout '' phase as feedback from the growing accretion heats the surrounding gas , driving a strong wind and eventually terminating rapid accretion , leaving a remnant with a black hole satisfying the @xmath25 relation .",
    "this can be identified with the traditional bright optical quasar phase , as the final stage of black hole growth with a rapidly declining density ( allowing the quasar to be observed in optical samples ) , giving typical luminosities , column densities , and lifetimes of optical quasars . in these stages ,",
    "larger luminosities imply more violent `` blowout '' events , i.e.  a brighter peak luminosity quasar more effectively expels the nearby gas and dust , rendering a dramatic decrease in column density at these bright stages ( see hopkins et al .",
    "2005f ) .",
    "we are essentially modeling this bimodality in more detail by directly determining the `` broad - line '' phase from our simulations .",
    "however , the broad line fraction - luminosity relation we predict is also a consequence of the more complicated relationship between column density , peak luminosity , and bolometric and observed luminosity , as opposed to the predictions from a model with correlation between @xmath98 and only observed luminosity .",
    "the key point is that we find , near the _ peak _ luminosity of the quasar , as feedback drives away gas and slows down accretion , the typical column densities fall rapidly with luminosity in a manner similar to that observed . in our model for the luminosity function , quasars below the observed `` break '' are either accreting efficiently in early stages of growth or are in sub - eddington phases coming into or out of their peak quasar activity . around and above the break ,",
    "the luminosity function becomes dominated by sources at high eddington ratio at or near their peak luminosities .",
    "based on the above calculation , we then _ expect _ what is observed , that in this range of luminosities , the fraction of objects observed with large column densities will rapidly decrease with luminosity as the observed sample is increasingly dominated by sources at their peak luminosities in this blowout phase .",
    "this also further emphasizes that the evolution of quasars dominates over static geometrical effects in determining the observed column density distribution at any given luminosity .    finally ,",
    "if host galaxy contamination were not a factor , we would expect from our column density model that , at low luminosities ( @xmath429 , well below the range of most observations shown ) , the broad - line fraction would again increase ( i.e.  the obscured fraction would decrease ) , as the lack of gas to power significant accretion would also imply a lack of gas to produce obscuring columns .",
    "however , at these luminosities , typical of faint seyfert galaxies or liners , our modeling becomes uncertain ; it is quite possible , as discussed previously , that cold gas remaining in relaxed systems could collapse to form a traditional dense molecular torus on scales @xmath430pc , well below our resolution limits .",
    "furthermore , host galaxy light is likely to overwhelm any agn broad - line contribution , and selection effects will also become significant at these luminosities .",
    "our determination of the `` broad - line '' or optical phase in quasar evolution allows us to make a further prediction , namely the mass distribution of currently active broad - line quasars . at some redshift ,",
    "the total number density of observed , currently active broad - line quasars with a given @xmath12 will be ( in the absence of selection effects ) @xmath431 where @xmath432 is the total integrated time that a quasar with peak luminosity @xmath12 spends as a `` broad - line '' object ( using our criterion for the ratio of the observed quasar b - band luminosity to that of the host galaxy ) , given by integrating our formulae in   [ sec : whenbl ] or directly calculated from the simulations .",
    "since we have determined roughly that a quasar should be observable as a `` broad - line '' object at times with @xmath433 primarily just after it reaches its peak luminosity , in the `` blowout '' phase of its evolution , we expect the instantaneous black hole mass at the time of observation as a broad - line quasar to be , on average , @xmath434 , where @xmath435 modulo the order unity corrections described in   [ sec : detailscompare ] .",
    "using our fitted @xmath235 distribution from the luminosity function , extrapolated to low redshift ( @xmath436 ) , and combining it with the integrated `` broad - line '' lifetimes from our simulations as above , we obtain the differential number density of sources in a logarithmic interval in @xmath12 .",
    "finally , we use our equation  [ eq : mbhf ] for @xmath437 determined from our fitted quasar lifetimes ( demanding that @xmath438 ) to convert this to a distribution in black hole mass .",
    "our predicted @xmath439 , i.e.  the number of observed _ active _ quasars at low redshift in a logarithmic interval of black hole mass , is shown in figure  [ fig : bl.massfunct ] .",
    "we consider the complete distribution of active quasar masses , for both broad - line and non broad - line objects , in the left panel of the figure , and the distribution of broad - line objects only , @xmath440 , in the right panel . on the left",
    ", we show the complete distribution which would be observed without any observational limits ( dashed line ) .",
    "we calculate this from the distributions of eddington ratios in our simulations , as a function of current and peak luminosity , and our fit to @xmath36 ( as , e.g.  for our monte carlo realizations ) .",
    "we also consider the observed distribution if we apply the luminosity limit for completeness from the sdss sample of @xcite ( dotted ) , @xmath441}>{10^{6}\\,l_{\\sun}}$ ] , which using their bolometric corrections yields @xmath442 , and then additionally applying their minimum velocity dispersion @xmath443 ( dot - dashed ) . finally , we can weight this distribution by luminosity ( solid line ) to compare directly to that determined in their fig .  1 .",
    "the red points are taken from the luminosity - weighted black hole mass function of @xcite , which serves as a rough estimate of the _ active _ black hole mass distribution given their selection effects .",
    "vertical error bars represent the range in parameterizations of the mass function from @xcite , including whether or not star formation is corrected for and limiting the sample to luminosities @xmath444 or eddington ratios @xmath445 .",
    "horizontal errors represent an uncertainty of @xmath446dex in the black hole mass estimation ( representative of uncertainties in the @xmath25 relation used ) .",
    "the agreement is good , especially given the significant effects of the selection criteria and luminosity - weighting .",
    "we also consider the predictions of a `` light - bulb '' or `` exponential / fixed eddington ratio '' model of the quasar lifetime for the active black hole mass distribution ( red lines ) . for purposes of the active black hole",
    "mass function , the two predictions are identical and independent of the assumed quasar lifetime ( modulo the arbitrary normalization ) , as both assume that all observed quasars are accreting at a fixed eddington ratio , giving the distribution of active black hole masses .",
    "the dashed line shows the prediction for the complete active black hole mass function , which rises sharply to lower luminosities , as it must given a luminosity function which increases monotonically to lower luminosities .",
    "the solid line shows the prediction of such a model with the complete set of selection effects from @xcite described above applied , as with the solid black line showing the prediction of our modeling . here , we chose the characteristic eddington ratio @xmath447 by fitting the predicted curve to the @xcite observations .",
    "note that both the characteristic eddington ratio and lifetime ( normalization ) of the curve are fitted , so the relative normalization of this curve and our full model prediction are not the same ; for example , the predicted total absolute number of active @xmath448 quasars is higher in the full model than in the light - bulb or exponential models .",
    "still , it is clear that these models produce too broad a distribution of active black hole masses , in disagreement with the observations .",
    "we could , of course , obtain an arbitrarily close agreement with the observations if we fit to the _ distribution _ of accretion rates , but such a model would recover a quasar lifetime and accretion rate distribution quite similar to ours , as is evident from the agreement between the predictions of our simulations and the observations . a purely empirical model of this type",
    "is considered by e.g.@xcite , who finds that similar qualitative evolution in the quasar lifetime and anti - hierarchical black hole assembly to that predicted by our modeling is implied by the combination of quasar luminosity functions and the black hole mass function .    on the right of the figure",
    ", we show our predicted mass distribution for low - redshift , active `` broad - line '' quasars ( solid black lines ) , where we estimate that an object is a `` broad - line '' quasar if the observed quasar b - band luminosity is above a factor @xmath363 of that of the host galaxy  dotted and dashed lines show the result if @xmath449 or 3 , respectively , parameterizing the range of different observed samples .",
    "as discussed above , the range of @xmath450 shown can be , alternatively , thought of as a parameterization of uncertainty in the host galaxy gas fraction , if ( in an observed sample ) , the sensitivity to seeing quasar broad lines against host galaxy contamination is known .",
    "therefore , the location of the peak in the active broad - line black hole mass function can be used , just as the mean broad line fraction vs.  luminosity , as a test of the typical gas fractions of bright quasar host galaxies , and can constrain potential evolution in these gas fractions with redshift .",
    "the prediction shown is testable , but appears to be in good agreement with preliminary results for the distribution of active broad - line black hole masses from the sdss ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the observations may show fewer low - mass black holes than we predict , but this is expected , as observed samples are likely incomplete at the low luminosities of these objects ( even at the eddington limit , a @xmath451 black hole has magnitude @xmath452 ) .",
    "if , in our model , we were to consider instead a standard torus scenario for the definition of the broad - line phase , we would predict the same curve as that shown in the left half of the figure ( black dashed ; our prediction for the cumulative active black hole mass function ) .",
    "this is because the standard torus model predicts that a constant fraction of objects are broad - line quasars , regardless of mass or luminosity , thus giving identical distributions of type i and type ii quasar masses .",
    "if we consider a luminosity - dependent or receding torus model , the prediction is nearly identical to the black line shown .",
    "this is because , as shown in figure  [ fig : bl.fraction ] , our prediction for the broad line fraction as a function of luminosity is similar to that of the receding torus model .",
    "the differences in the model predictions for the broad - line fraction as a function of luminosity do manifest in the prediction for the active broad - line black hole mass function , but the difference in these models is smaller than the @xmath453 range from different values of @xmath361 shown .",
    "however , if we consider different models for the quasar light curve or lifetime , the predicted active broad - line mass function is quite different ( as is the cumulative active black hole mass function ) .",
    "we show the predictions of a light - bulb or exponential light curve model for quasar evolution in the figure , adopting either a standard torus model ( red ) or receding torus model ( blue ) to determine the broad - line fraction as a function of luminosity . for the standard torus model ,",
    "this predicts that the broad line mass function should trace the observed luminosity function , rising monotonically to lower black hole masses in power - law fashion ( just as seen in the red dashed line in the left half of the figure for the cumulative black hole mass function ) . for the receding torus model",
    ", the active black hole mass function shows a peak ( because , at lower luminosities , there are more observed quasars , but a larger fraction of them are obscured ) .",
    "however , the location of this peak is at roughly an order of magnitude smaller black hole mass than for our prediction .",
    "this assumes a typical eddington ratio @xmath126 , which we have fitted to the cumulative black hole mass function  the peak in the broad - line active black hole mass function in these models could be shifted to larger black hole masses by assuming a smaller typical eddington ratio , but this would only worsen the agreement with the cumulative black hole mass function of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a robust difference between the models is that the light bulb or eddington - limited / exponential models predict , for the standard torus case , no turnover in the active broad - line black hole mass function , and for the receding torus case , a broader distribution in active broad - line quasar black hole masses than is predicted in our modeling .",
    "roughly , the lognormal width of this distribution in our model is @xmath454dex , whereas the light - bulb or exponential light curve models have a distribution with width @xmath455dex . as noted above",
    ", we obtain a similar prediction if we adopt our full obscuration model instead of the receding torus model here .",
    "a determination of the range of active , broad - line quasar masses can , therefore , constrain quasar lifetimes and light curves .",
    "our model makes an accurate prediction for the distribution of _ active _ black hole masses , even at @xmath436 where our extrapolation of the luminosity function is uncertain .",
    "it is important to distinguish this from the predicted relic black hole mass distribution , derived in ",
    "[ sec : smbh ] , which must account for all quasars , i.e.  @xmath235 integrated over redshift .",
    "we additionally find for broad - line quasars , as we expect from our prediction of the broad - line phase , that these objects are primarily radiating at large eddington ratios , @xmath456 , but we address this in more detail in   [ sec : eddington ] .",
    "the success of this prediction serves not only to support our model , but also implies that we can extrapolate to fairly low luminosities , even bright seyfert systems at @xmath436 .",
    "this suggests that many of these systems , at least at the bright end , may be related to our assumed quasar evolution model , fueled by similar mechanisms and either exhibiting weak interactions among galaxies or relaxing from an earlier , brighter stage in their evolution . as we speculate in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , our description of self - regulated black hole growth may also be relevant to fainter seyferts , even those that reside in apparently undisturbed galaxies .",
    "in traditional models of quasar lifetimes and light curves , the eddington ratio , @xmath457 is generally assumed to be constant .",
    "even complex models of the quasar population which allow for a wide range of eddington ratios according to some probability distribution @xmath458 implicitly associate a fixed eddington ratio with each individual quasar , and do not allow for @xmath458 to depend on instantaneous luminosity or host system properties .",
    "however , this is a misleading assumption in the context of our model , as the eddington ratio varies in a complicated manner over most of the quasar light curve .",
    "furthermore , the integrated time at a given eddington ratio is different in different systems , with more massive , higher peak luminosity systems spending more time at large ( @xmath459 ) eddington ratios .",
    "the probability of being at a given eddington ratio should properly be thought of as a conditional joint distribution @xmath460 in both instantaneous and peak luminosity , just as the quasar `` lifetime '' is more properly a conditional distribution @xmath461 . rather than adopting a uniform eddington ratio or eddington ratio distribution",
    ", empirical estimates must consider more detailed formulations such as the framework presented in @xcite , which allows for a conditional bivariate eddington ratio distribution and can therefore incorporate these physically motivated dependencies and complications in de - convolving observations of the quasar luminosity function to determine e.g.  eddington ratio distributions , active black hole mass functions , and other physical quantities .",
    "figure  [ fig : pofl.a3 ] shows the distribution of eddington ratios as a function of luminosity for the fiducial , milky way - like a3 simulation ( @xmath462 ) . over the course of the simulation , the system spends a roughly comparable amount of time at a wide range of eddington ratios from @xmath463 . at high luminosities ,",
    "@xmath464 for a system with @xmath465 , the range of eddington ratios , is concentrated at high values @xmath466 with some time spent at ratios as low as @xmath467 .",
    "note , however , that the y - axis of the plot is scaled logarithmically , so the time spent at @xmath467 in this luminosity interval is a factor @xmath468 smaller than the time spent at @xmath469 . considering lower luminosities @xmath470 , the distribution of eddington ratios broadens down to @xmath471 . going to lower luminosities still , @xmath472 ,",
    "the distribution broadens further , with comparable time spent at ratios as low as @xmath473 , and becomes somewhat bimodal . at large luminosities near @xmath12 ,",
    "the system is primarily in eddington - limited or near - eddington growth .",
    "however , as we consider lower luminosities , we include both early times when the black hole is growing efficiently ( high @xmath183 ) and late or intermediate times when the black hole is more massive but the accretion rate falls ( low @xmath183 ) .",
    "as we go to lower luminosities , the _ total _ time spent in sub - eddington states increasingly dominates the time spent at @xmath474 , although the time spent at any given value of @xmath183 is fairly flat with @xmath475 .",
    "roughly , at some luminosity @xmath13 , there is a constant probability of being in some logarithmic interval in @xmath183 , @xmath476^{-1},\\ \\frac{l}{{l_{\\rm peak } } } < l < 1,\\ ] ] and @xmath477 otherwise .",
    "this is especially clear if we compare the distribution of eddington ratios in each luminosity range obtained if we consider only times after the final merger of the black holes ( dotted histograms ) . at the highest luminosities , the distribution is identical to that obtained previously , since all the time at these luminosities is during the final merger .",
    "however , as we move to lower luminosities , the characteristic @xmath183 move systematically lower , as we are seeing only the relaxation after the final `` blowout '' near @xmath12 , with characteristic eddington ratio @xmath478 at any given luminosity @xmath13 .",
    "these trends are also clear if we consider the distribution of _ instantaneous _ black hole masses in each luminosity interval shown in the figure , which is trivially related to the eddington ratio distribution at a given luminosity @xmath13 as @xmath479 of course , it is clear here that @xmath480 if we consider only times after the final merger .",
    "it has also been argued from observations of stellar black hole binaries that a transition between accretion states occurs at a critical eddington ratio @xmath481 , from radiatively inefficient accretion flows at low accretion rates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to radiatively efficient accretion through a standard @xcite disk .",
    "although the critical eddington ratio for supermassive black holes is uncertain , observations of black hole binaries @xcite as well as theoretical extensions of accretion models ( e.g. , * ? ?",

    "we see that the distribution of eddington ratios is essentially identical , with only a slightly higher probability of observing extremely low eddington ratios @xmath488 . of course",
    ", our modeling of accretion processes does not allow us to accurately describe adaf - like accretion at these low eddington ratios , but such low values are not relevant for the observed luminosity functions and quantities with which we make our comparisons .",
    "this implies that such a transition in the radiative efficiency with accretion rate should not alter our conclusions regarding the luminosity function and the @xmath36 distribution ( essentially , the corrections are important only at luminosities well below those relevant in constructing the observed luminosity functions ; see also hopkins et al .",

    "despite the broad range of eddington ratios in the simulations , this entire distribution is unlikely to be observable in many samples .",
    "the effect of this can be predicted based on the behavior seen in figure  [ fig : pofl.a3 ] .",
    "for example , we consider the distribution of eddington ratios that would be observed if the b - band luminosity @xmath489 , comparable to the selection limits at high redshift of many optical quasar samples . as expected from the change in @xmath183 with luminosity , this restricts the observed range of eddington ratios to large values @xmath490 , in good agreement with the range of eddington ratios actually observed in such samples .",
    "essentially , it has reduced the observed range to a bolometric luminosity @xmath491 in the case shown , giving a similar distribution to that seen in the lower panel of the figure .",
    "we compare our predicted distribution of eddington ratios to observations in figure  [ fig : pofl.all ] . using the distribution of peak luminosities @xmath36 determined from the luminosity function",
    ", we can integrate over all luminosities to infer the observed eddington ratio distribution , @xmath492 as our estimate of @xmath493 above is rough , we do this by binning in @xmath12 and averaging the binned @xmath494 for each simulation in the range of @xmath12 , then weighting by @xmath36 and integrating .",
    "we consider both the entire distribution that would be observed in the absence of selection effects ( red histograms ) , and the distribution observed demanding a b - band luminosity above some reference value , @xmath495 ( black histograms ) .",
    "the results are shown for redshifts @xmath496 and @xmath497 , along with the observed distribution from @xcite , with assumed poisson errors .",
    "the observations should be compared to the black histograms , which have luminosity thresholds @xmath498 for @xmath496 and @xmath497 , respectively , corresponding approximately to the minimum observable luminosities in the observed samples in each redshift interval .",
    "the agreement is good , given the observational uncertainties , and it suggests that the observed eddington ratio distribution can be related to the non - trivial nature of quasar lifetimes and light curves we model , rather than some arbitrary distribution of fixed @xmath183 across sources .",
    "however , the selection effects in the observed samples are quite significant  the complete distribution of eddington ratios is similar in both samples , implying that the difference in the observed eddington ratio distribution is primarily a consequence of the higher luminosity limit in the observed samples  and a more detailed test of this prediction requires fainter samples .",
    "still , there is a systematic offset in the observed samples at @xmath496 and @xmath499 which does not owe to selection effects . at progressively lower redshifts , more quasars with luminosities further below the `` break '' in the luminosity function",
    "are observed , and therefore the observed eddington ratio is broadened to lower eddington ratios @xmath467 , whereas at high redshift the distribution is more peaked at slightly higher eddington ratios .",
    "this difference , although not dramatic , is a prediction of our model not captured in `` light bulb '' or `` fixed eddington ratio '' models , even when allowing for a distribution of eddington ratios , if such a distribution is static .",
    "we demonstrate this by fitting the low - redshift eddington ratio distribution to a gaussian ( blue dashed lines in upper left ) , and then assuming that this distribution of accretion rates is unchanged with redshift , giving ( after applying the same selection effects which yield the black histograms plotted ) the blue dashed line in the upper right panel .",
    "although the agreement may appear reasonable , the difference is significant  such a fit overpredicts the fraction of high redshift objects at eddington ratios @xmath500 and underpredicts the fraction at @xmath501 , giving a somewhat poor fit overall ( @xmath502 , but with typical @xmath503 overpredictions for eddington ratios @xmath504 ) .",
    "furthermore , without being modified to allow for a distribution of eddington ratios , such models are clearly inconsistent with the observations , as they would predict a single , constant eddington ratio .",
    "however , models which fit the observed evolution in the quasar luminosity function with a non - static distribution of accretion rates do recover the broadening of the eddington ratio distribution at low redshift , so long as strong evolution in the distribution of accretion rates for systems of a given black hole mass is not allowed @xcite , giving a qualitatively similar picture of the evolution we model .",
    "regardless of the evolution in accretion rates , an advantage of our modeling is that it provides a physically motivated predicted distribution of accretion rates , as opposed to being forced to adopt the distribution of accretion rates from observational input ( which can be , as demonstrated in the figure , significantly biased by observational selection effects ) .",
    "the dotted histograms show the distribution if we apply our adaf correction to the intrinsic distribution , and demonstrate that this does not significantly change the result .",
    "we note that our model for black hole accretion employs the eddington limit as a maximum accretion rate ; if we remove this restriction , we find that the simulations spend some small but non - negligible time with @xmath505 , which is also consistent with the observations .",
    "furthermore , we can make a prediction of this model which can be falsified , namely that the eddington ratio distribution at luminosities well below the break in the luminosity function should be broader and extend to lower values than the distribution at luminosities above the break luminosity .",
    "we quantify this in the lower panels of figure  [ fig : pofl.all ] , for the distribution at low redshifts @xmath506 . here",
    "we consider two bins in luminosity , @xmath507 and @xmath508 , for redshifts where the break in the luminosity function is at approximately @xmath509 . clearly , the distribution is broader and extends to lower eddington ratios in the former luminosity interval , whereas in the latter it is strongly peaked about @xmath456 , for both the complete distribution ( black ) and that with @xmath489 ( red ) .",
    "the distribution obtained applying the adaf correction described above is shown as dotted histograms . despite the fact that the eddington ratio distribution at low luminosities will be strongly biased by selection effects , a reasonably complete sample should be able to test this prediction , at least qualitatively .",
    "we illustrate the effects of changing observed waveband , redshift , and luminosity thresholds on the observed eddington ratio distribution in figure  [ fig : pofl.grid ] . here",
    ", we plot the predicted distribution of eddington ratios determined as in figure  [ fig : pofl.all ] , from our fitted @xmath36 distribution at each redshift and the distribution of eddington ratios as a function of instantaneous and peak luminosity in each of our simulations ( specifically , these are drawn from the monte carlo realizations of the quasar population described in   [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "we show the predictions at three redshifts @xmath187 ( top panels ) , @xmath510 ( middle ) , and @xmath511 ( bottom ) . for each redshift ,",
    "results are shown in three wavebands , and with three reference luminosities . in b - band , we require @xmath512 ( red ) , @xmath513 ( blue ) , and @xmath514 ( black ) . in soft x - rays , @xmath515)>40\\ ( \\rm red),\\ 42\\ ( \\rm blue),\\ 44\\ ( \\rm black)$ ] . in hard x - rays , @xmath516)>41\\ ( \\rm red),\\ 43\\ ( \\rm blue),\\ 45\\ ( \\rm black)$ ] . the observationally inferred distribution of eddington ratios at each redshift is loosely estimated by adopting a constant bolometric correction from the observed ( attenuated ) luminosity in each of three bands shown , i.e.assuming @xmath517 ( @xmath518 ; left ) , @xmath519 ( 0.5 - 2 kev ; middle ) , and @xmath520 ( 2 - 10 kev ; right ) .",
    "this follows common practice in many observational estimates of the eddington ratio distribution and allows for the effects of attenuation , but we caution that it can be misleading .",
    "if we instead use the luminosity - dependent bolometric corrections of @xcite which we adopt throughout , even given that we are calculating from the observed ( attenuated ) luminosities , we do not see the large population of highly sub - eddington ( eddington ratios @xmath521 ) quasars in soft and hard x - ray samples with low luminosity thresholds .",
    "this is because these are actually reasonably high - eddington ratio quasars , but our bolometric corrections imply that a larger fraction of the bolometric luminosity is radiated in the x - ray at low bolometric luminosity , meaning that assuming a constant bolometric correction will underestimate the eddington ratios of high - bolometric luminosity sources .",
    "regardless , the figure illustrates both the importance of different wavelengths ( i.e.  the ability to observe more low - eddington ratio sources in x - ray as compared to optical samples ) and luminosity / magnitude limits on the inferred distribution of eddington ratios .",
    "for example , even for relatively deep b - band quasar samples complete to @xmath522 ( i.e.  complete to essentially all objects traditionally classified as having `` quasar - like '' luminosities ) , the expected observed eddington ratio distribution at @xmath523 is quite sharply peaked about @xmath524 , in good agreement with recent observational results @xcite .",
    "we do not compare to the @xmath390 distribution of black hole accretion rates , as this is dominated by objects at extremely low eddington ratios @xmath525 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are well below the range we model , and are not likely to be driven by merger activity ( many of these objects are quiescent , low - luminosity seyferts in normal spiral galaxy hosts ) ; furthermore , many of these objects are not accreting at the bondi rate @xcite , clearly showing that our simulations must incorporate more sophisticated models for accretion in quiescent , low - luminosity states ( when gravitational torques can not provide a mechanism to drive large amounts of gas to the central regions of the galaxy ) in order to describe such phases .",
    "however , it has been suggested that the rapid `` blowout '' phase and subsequent decay in accretion rates seen in our simulations , coupled with spectral modeling of radiatively inefficient accretion modes , can explain the apparently bimodal distribution of low - redshift accretion rates @xcite .",
    "moreover , present - day , relaxed ellipticals are observed to have mass accretion rates @xmath526 implying a long relaxation time at moderate and low accretion rates , qualitatively similar to that seen after the `` blowout '' in our modeling ( hopkins et al .",
    "2005f ) . a pure exponential decay in accretion rate after the peak quasar phase would give @xmath527 at present , where @xmath528 is the hubble time and @xmath134 is the quasar lifetime of order e.g.  the salpeter time @xmath529yr , yielding an unreasonably low expected accretion rate @xmath530 .",
    "even assuming an order of magnitude larger quasar lifetime , this gives @xmath531 , far below observed values , implying that regardless of the fueling mechanisms at low luminosities , the basic key point of our modeling must be true to some extent , namely that quasars spend long times relaxing at moderate to low eddington ratios .",
    "from the @xmath3-@xmath4 relation and other host galaxy - black hole scalings , estimates of bulge and spheroid velocity dispersions have been used to determine the total mass density ( @xmath532 ) and mass distribution of local , primarily inactive supermassive black holes ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these estimates , along with others based on x - ray background synthesis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have compared these quantities to those expected based on the mass distribution of ` relic ' black holes grown in quasars .",
    "it appears that most , and perhaps nearly all of the present - day black hole mass density was accumulated in bright quasar phases , and the @xmath25 and @xmath533 correlations yield estimates of the local mass function in good agreement with those from hard x - ray agn luminosity functions @xcite .",
    "however , this modeling is dependent on several assumptions .",
    "namely , the average radiative efficiency @xmath162 , eddington ratio @xmath183 , and average quasar lifetime @xmath134 are generally taken to be constants and either input into the model or constrained by demanding agreement with the local mass function . in our simulations , we find the quasar lifetime and eddington ratio to be complex functions of both luminosity and host system properties ( as opposed to being constants ) .",
    "we also find that quasars spend a large fraction of their lives in obscured growth phases , suggesting some mass gain outside of the bright quasar phase .",
    "it is thus of interest to determine the relic black hole mass function expected from our model for quasar evolution .    using our estimate for the birthrate of quasars with a given peak luminosity at a particular redshift , @xmath36 , obtained from the luminosity function in ",
    "[ sec : fulllf ] , we can estimate the total number density of relic quasars accumulated by a particular redshift that were born with a given @xmath12 ( per logarithmic interval in @xmath12 ) from @xmath534 by redshift @xmath390 , most of these quasars will be `` dead , '' with only a small residual fraction having been activated in the recent past .",
    "using our log - normal form for @xmath36 , with normalization @xmath264 and dispersion @xmath266 held constant and only the median @xmath535 evolving with redshift , this integral can be evaluated numerically to give the space density of relic quasars @xmath536 .",
    "finally , we use @xmath437 , roughly the eddington mass of the given peak luminosity ( but determined more precisely in   [ sec : detailscompare ] ) to convert from @xmath537 to @xmath538 .",
    "this formulation implicitly assumes that black holes do not undergo subsequent mergers after the initial quasar - producing event .",
    "however , this effect should be small ( a factor @xmath539 ) as subsequent mergers would be dry ( gas poor ) .",
    "we explicitly calculate the effects of dry mergers on the spheroid mass function ( essentially a rescaling of the black hole mass function calculated here ) in @xcite , and show that this is a small effect ( significantly less than the uncertainties owing to our fit to the quasar luminosity function ) even assuming the maximum dry merger rates of e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this mass function can then be integrated over @xmath540 to give the total present - day black hole mass density , @xmath532 . neglecting temporarily the small corrections to @xmath437 from ",
    "[ sec : detailscompare ] , we expect @xmath541 where @xmath542 , so therefore , @xmath543 this can be combined with the integral over redshift for @xmath536 , giving , at each @xmath544 , a pure gaussian integral over @xmath545 , in the form @xmath546 where @xmath547 and @xmath548 is the fractional lookback time at some upper limit .",
    "we must modify this integral above @xmath309 to account for the decreasing space density of bright quasars , applying either our density or peak - luminosity evolution turnover from   [ sec : fulllf ] , but quasars at these high redshifts contribute only a small fraction to the present - day density .",
    "thus , in this formulation , the evolution of the total supermassive black hole mass density , i.e.  @xmath549 , is given approximately by the dimensionless integral above , and depends only on how @xmath265 evolves , essentially the rate at which the break in the quasar luminosity function shifts .",
    "although this is not strictly true if we include corrections to @xmath437 based on @xmath12 , the difference is small and this behavior is essentially preserved .",
    "note that the total supermassive black hole mass density is independent of corrections from subsequent dry mergers , which ( being gas poor ) conserve total black hole mass .",
    "figure  [ fig : smbh.distrib ] shows our prediction for the mass distribution of supermassive black holes , as well as the total density @xmath532 and its evolution with redshift .",
    "we find a total relic black hole mass density of @xmath550 , in agreement with the observational estimate of @xmath551 , by @xcite ( @xmath552 ; their result is converted from @xmath553 ) , and within @xmath554 of the value @xmath555 , of @xcite , based on the observations of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the fractional evolution of @xmath532 with redshift is quite well constrained , and we find , as with previous estimates , that most of the present - day black hole mass density accumulates at moderate to low redshifts @xmath556 .",
    "the @xmath554 errors are shown as dotted lines in the figure , and are close to our best - fit estimate , as we have demonstrated that this quantity depends only on @xmath281 , the rate of evolution of the break in the luminosity function with redshift , which is fairly well - constrained by observations ( from our fitting to the luminosity functions , @xmath557 ) . the difference in @xmath532",
    "if we include or neglect the small corrections to @xmath143 is negligible compared to our errors ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "our estimate for the relic black hole mass distribution ( thick black line ) also agrees well with observational estimates , with all observations within the range allowed by the @xmath554 errors of our fitting to the luminosity function ( dotted lines ) .",
    "the observations shown are again from @xcite , based on the combination of observations by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the high mass end of the black hole mass function @xmath558 is relatively sensitive to whether or not we apply the @xmath437 corrections of ",
    "[ sec : detailscompare ] , instead of taking @xmath559 ( thin line ) , as well as to our fitting procedure .",
    "however , the agreement is still good , and this is also where the observational estimates of the mass distribution are most uncertain , as they are generally extrapolated to these masses , and are sensitive to the assumed intrinsic dispersions in the @xmath560 and @xmath533 relations @xcite .    if , instead , we adopt a light - bulb , constant eddington ratio , or exponential light curve model for quasar evolution , we would have @xmath561 , and thus the prediction would be similar to the thin black line shown , a somewhat worse fit at high black hole masses .",
    "however , in these models this can be remedied by adjusting the typical eddington ratios , quasar lifetimes , or radiative efficiencies .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "these works demonstrate that the observed quasar luminosity functions are consistent with the relic supermassive black hole mass function , given typical radiative efficiencies @xmath562 and eddington ratios @xmath563 , and that most of the mass of black holes is accumulated in bright , observed phases , or else the required radiative efficiency would violate theoretical limits .",
    "that our model of quasar lifetimes and obscuration reproduces the observed @xmath390 supermassive black hole mass function explicitly demonstrates that we are consistent with these constraints . by choice , the radiative efficiency in our simulations is @xmath22 , and accretion rates are not allowed to exceed eddington . as noted in   [ sec : blqso ] , most of the black hole mass is accumulated and radiant energy released in the final , `` blowout '' phase of quasar evolution , and here our black hole mass function and cumulative black hole mass density demonstrate that our modeling is consistent with integrated energy and mass arguments such as that of @xcite , despite the fact that quasars spend more _ time _ in obscured phases than they do in bright optical quasar phases .",
    "in fact , comparison of our predicted total black hole mass density with estimates from the @xmath390 black hole mass distribution allows some latitude for significant mass gain in radiatively inefficient growth or black holes in small , disky spheroids , although we emphasize that this is mainly because the uncertainty in our prediction is large , it is not inherent or necessary in our modeling .",
    "the anti - hierarchical nature of black hole formation , where less massive black holes are formed at lower redshift , is reflected in our modeling by the shift of the break in the quasar luminosity function to lower values with decreasing redshift .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ fig : smbh.distrib ] , where the black hole mass distributions are shown at redshifts @xmath564 , assuming either pure peak luminosity evolution or pure density evolution for @xmath312 ( dot - dashed and dashed , respectively ) .",
    "while the choice for the turnover in the @xmath312 quasar density matters little for the @xmath565 black hole mass functions , the low-@xmath3 distribution at high redshift ( where observations do not constrain @xmath36 well ) is quite different between the two models .",
    "figure  [ fig : smbh.evol ] plots the fractional number density of black holes of a given mass as a function of redshift , i.e.  @xmath566 , where @xmath567 is just the number density at mass @xmath568 .",
    "this figure demonstrates that higher - mass black holes originated over a larger range of redshifts , and that they mostly formed at higher redshift , compared to lower - mass black holes .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : smbh.evol ] compares our prediction to that of a light - bulb or exponential light curve model for quasar lifetimes . in these models , the anti - hierarchical nature of black hole assembly",

    "if spheroids and black holes are produced together , as in our picture , these models of the quasar lifetime would imply that spheroids of masses @xmath572 all formed over nearly identical ranges of redshifts , which is inconsistent with many observations indicating anti - hierarchical growth of the red , elliptical galaxy population ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "our modeling reproduces the observed total density and mass distribution of supermassive black holes at @xmath390 with black holes accreting at the canonical efficiency @xmath22 expected for efficient accretion through a @xcite disk .",
    "presumably , a large change in @xmath162 would give a significantly different relation between peak luminosity and black hole mass ( for the same @xmath12 , @xmath573 ) , and thus if the quasar lifetime remained similar as a function of peak luminosity , this would translate to a shift in the black hole mass function . the long obscured stage in black hole evolution",
    "does not generate problems in reproducing the black hole mass density , and the final phases of growth are still in bright optical quasar stages .",

    "however , these models make arbitrary assumptions about the ratio of obscured to unobscured sources and its evolution with redshift , choosing these quantities to reproduce the x - ray background .",

    "we can test our model by examining whether the quasar luminosity function , relic agn mass distribution , and x - ray background can be simultaneously reproduced in a self - consistent manner . because our formulation describes the birthrate of quasars with a peak luminosity @xmath12",

    "these integrated spectra are shown as the dot - dashed lines in the figure , and agree well with the actual integrated spectra of the simulations , demonstrating the self - consistency of our model and applicability of our fitted lifetimes .",

    "we determine @xmath582 by demanding that the total energetics be correct , @xmath583 .",
    "the predicted integrated energy spectra are shown as the dashed lines , and under - predict the soft and hard x - ray energy output by a factor @xmath189 .",

    "* ) , reflected in our bolometric corrections .",
    "thus , assuming that the quasar spends all its time at @xmath12 does not account for extended times at lower luminosity , where the ratio of x - ray to total luminosity is higher , which would generate an integrated spectrum with a larger fraction of its energy in the x - ray .",

    "these models produce the same overall @xmath612kev normalization , as this is relatively unaffected by obscuration , but they predict a slightly ( @xmath610 ) higher background at low energies , giving a slightly softer spectrum .",
    "this may appear counterintuitive , given that in figure  [ fig : nh.distrib ] these models tend to overpredict the number of high - column density sources , but this is because these models predict a strongly _ bimodal _ column density distribution , with unobscured sightlines encountering negligible column densities .",
    "these unobscured sightlines dominate the soft x - ray integrated spectrum , where the large column densities through the torus attenuate the quasar spectrum heavily . however , this net offset in the predicted background spectrum is generally within the range of the systematic theoretical and observational uncertainties , and can further be alleviated by tuning the parameters of the torus model to fit the x - ray background spectrum ( e.g.  treister & urry 2005 , although their fits require a larger fraction of compton - thick @xmath613 sources than shown for even the receding torus model in figure  [ fig : nh.distrib ] ) .",
    "the feature at @xmath614kev in the standard torus model prediction is a consequence of assuming that `` unobscured '' lines of sight encounter negligible column density , and does not appear if such sightlines encounter moderate ( @xmath615 ) columns .",
    "the lower panel of the figure shows the predicted x - ray background spectrum if we instead consider a light - bulb or exponential light curve ( fixed eddington ratio ) model for the quasar lifetime , again with various descriptions of quasar obscuration . in such models ,",
    "the predicted x - ray background spectrum is independent of the quasar lifetime or characteristic eddington ratio assumed ( see equation  [ eq : simple.xrb ] ) .",
    "however , as shown in figure  [ fig : integ.spectra ] , these models do imply a different integrated spectrum for quasars ; i.e.  different effective bolometric corrections for predicting the x - ray background .",
    "in particular , in this model , the observed quasar spectrum at a given luminosity ( averaged over the quasar population at that luminosity ) is the same as the `` effective '' quasar spectrum one would use to calculate the _ total _ contribution to the x - ray background from quasars of the corresponding observed or peak luminosity , whereas this is not true in our model of quasar lifetimes .",
    "the observations are shown in the same manner as the preceding panels .",
    "the black solid line shows the prediction with this simplified model for the quasar lifetime , but still adopting our full model for obscuration as a function of instantaneous and peak luminosity , the dashed line assumes instead a standard torus model for obscuration , and the dotted line assumes a receding torus for the obscuration .",
    "the variations among different obscuration models are relatively small at most energies , and similar to those discussed above adopting our full model of quasar lifetimes .    in all three cases , however , this model for the quasar lifetime significantly under - predicts the x - ray background , particularly at the @xmath612kev peak .",
    "this shortfall is well - known , and earlier attempts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the difference between the predictions of various quasar lifetime models is , as explained above , attributable to the difference between the integrated quasar spectrum produced in our full model of the quasar lifetime ( in which quasars spend long periods of time at low luminosities , with harder x - ray spectra ) , and the integrated spectrum in these simplified quasar lifetime models , which is proportional to the _ instantaneous _ quasar spectrum , and therefore underpredicts the hard x - ray portion of the spectrum by as much as @xmath616 .",
    "our prediction of the x - ray background agrees well with the observed spectrum over the range @xmath617 .",
    "( at energies above @xmath618 it is likely that processes we have not included , such as those involving magnetic fields , contribute significantly to the background . ) unlike previous synthesis models for the x - ray background , we are able to do so without invoking assumptions about large compton thick populations or larger obscured populations at different redshifts . in part , this is because our modeling allows us to predict , based on @xmath36 and our column density formulation , the population of compton thick sources ( see figure  [ fig : nh.distrib ] ) . however , as we have demonstrated , it is primarily because the deficit in previous synthesis models can be attributed to their inability to properly account for the dependence of quasar lifetimes and attenuation on both the instantaneous quasar luminosity and the host system properties ( peak luminosity ) .",
    "our picture , on the other hand , yields an estimate for the x - ray background spectrum that is simultaneously consistent with the observed supermassive black hole mass distribution and total density , as well as the `` luminosity - dependent density evolution '' observed in x - ray samples @xcite .",
    "the background is primarily built up from @xmath619 to @xmath620 , as is evident from the evolution of the black hole mass density in figure  [ fig : smbh.distrib ] , although a harder spectrum at low luminosities will weight this slightly towards lower redshifts ( where more low - luminosity quasars are forming ) .",
    "compton thick and relaxing , low - luminosity sources are accounted for , not as large , independent populations , but as evolutionary phenomena continuously connected to the `` normal '' quasar population .",
    "our modeling suggests two important paradigm shifts in interpreting quasar populations and evolution :    * ( 1 ) * first , as proposed in @xcite , a proper accounting of the luminosity dependence of quasar lifetimes ( as opposed to models in which quasars grow in a pure exponential fashion or turn on and off as `` light bulbs '' ) implies a novel interpretation of the luminosity function . the steep bright end ( luminosities above",
    "the `` break '' in the luminosity function ) consists of quasars radiating near their eddington limits and is directly related to the distribution of intrinsic peak luminosities ( or final black hole masses ) as has been assumed previously .",
    "however , the shallow , faint end of the luminosity function describes black holes either growing in early stages of activity or in extended , quiescent states going into or coming out of a peak bright quasar phase , with eddington ratios generally between @xmath621 and 1 .",
    "the `` break '' luminosity in the luminosity function corresponds directly to the _ peak _ in the birthrate of quasars as a function of peak luminosity @xmath235 .",
    "this interpretation resolves inconsistencies in a number of previous theoretical studies .",
    "for example , semi - analytical models of the quasar luminosity functions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) assume , based on simplified models for the quasar lifetime , that quasars at the faint end of the luminosity function correspond to low final - mass black holes ( low @xmath622 ) , presumably in small halos .",
    "consequently , these models overpredict the number of active low - mass black holes ( as estimated from radio source counts ) , especially at high redshift , by orders of magnitude @xcite , and overpredict the number of low - mass spheroids and red galaxies observed @xcite .",
    "moreover , both observations @xcite and comparison of the present - day black hole mass function with radio and x - ray luminosity functions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest anti - hierarchical evolution for the growth of supermassive black holes , where the most massive black holes were produced mainly at high ( @xmath623 ) redshift , and low - mass black holes mostly formed later , which does not follow from idealized descriptions of quasar lifetimes and the luminosity function ( for a review , see e.g.  combes 2005 ) .    a one - to - one correspondence between observed luminosity and black hole mass does produce anti - hierarchical behavior in some sense at the high - mass end , because the most massive black holes are formed at @xmath289 during the peak of bright quasar activity and the quasar luminosity function evolves to lower luminosities at lower redshifts ( as is also the case for our model because the bright end of the luminosity function is dominated by sources near their peak luminosities ) .",
    "however , at black hole masses equal to or below @xmath624 ( i.e.  galaxies of stellar mass @xmath625 ) , the evolution in the quasar luminosity function implies a roughly constant production of black holes with these masses at all redshifts , which is inconsistent with observations of galaxy spheroids indicating that typical ages increase with mass , ruling out a large population of low - mass spheroids with ages equal to or older than those of high - mass spheroids ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "furthermore , in these earlier models , a `` break '' in the luminosity function is not necessarily reproduced @xcite , and the faint - end slope has no direct physical motivation .",
    "the break may be caused by feedback mechanisms which set a characteristic turnover in both the galaxy mass function and quasar luminosity function ( e.g. , scannapieco & oh 2004 ; dekel & birnboim 2004 ) , as in our modeling .",
    "the @xmath36 distributions in our model and `` light bulb '' or `` fixed eddington ratio '' models are comparable at and above the break in the quasar luminosity function , and therefore make similar predictions for some observations at these luminosities . however , the _ faint - end _",
    "slope has a different physical motivation in our model .",
    "unlike the bright - end slope , which is determined directly by the active final black hole mass function or peak luminosity distribution ( in essentially all models of the quasar lifetime ) , the faint - end slope in our modeling is a consequence of the quasar lifetime as a function of luminosity , and is a prediction of our simulations and modeling almost independent of the underlying faint - end slope of the active black hole mass function or peak luminosity distribution . in @xcite",
    "we examine this in more detail , and demonstrate that it predicts well the evolution in the faint - end quasar luminosity function slope with redshift and the observed `` luminosity - dependent density evolution '' in many samples @xcite .",
    "other observational evidence for our picture exists ; for example in the observed distribution of eddington ratios ( see   [ sec : eddington ] ) , the distribution of low - redshift , active black hole masses ( see   [ sec : blmasses ] ) , and the turnover in the expected distribution of black hole masses in early - type galaxies at @xmath624 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "total ( integrated ) quasar lifetimes estimated from observations are inferred to increase with increasing black hole mass as we predict @xcite , and furthermore , the eddington ratios of observed quasar samples are seen to increase systematically with redshift , as the sample becomes increasingly dominated by luminosities above the break in the luminosity function @xcite .",
    "moreover , observations show that the evolution of the luminosity function with decreasing redshift is driven by a decrease in the characteristic mass scale of actively accreting black holes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which can be explained in our model by the relation of the observed luminosity function to the _ peak _ in the distribution of active black hole masses @xmath36 .",
    "this observation , however , has caused considerable confusion , as observations of both radio - quiet @xcite and radio - loud @xcite local ( low redshift ) agn indicate that nuclear and host luminosities are uncorrelated , implying that nuclear luminosity does not depend on black hole mass @xcite , and therefore that the primary variable determining the nuclear luminosity is the eddington ratio , with the luminosity function spanning a broad range in eddington ratios @xcite .",
    "furthermore , observations show that this is _ not _ true of high redshift quasars , as both direct estimates of accretion rates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the fact that their high luminosities would yield unreasonably large black hole masses rule out substantially sub - eddington accretion rates for most objects .",
    "many previous empirical and semi - analytical models could not simultaneously account for these observations .",
    "to explain just the low - redshift observations , such models adopt tunable distributions of eddington ratios fitted to the data .",
    "however , both these observations are consequences of our interpretation of the luminosity function , as observations of local agn and the low - redshift luminosity function are dominated by quasars below the break in the luminosity function , which are undergoing sub - eddington growth and span a wide range of eddington ratios , while observations at high redshift are dominated by bright objects at or above the break in the luminosity function , which are undergoing eddington - limited ( or near eddington - limited ) growth near their peak luminosity ( see   [ sec : eddington ] ) .    *",
    "( 2 ) * the second paradigm shift indicated by our modeling is that quasar obscuration is not a static or quasi - static geometric effect , but is primarily an _ evolutionary _ effect . the physical reasoning for this is simple : the massive gas inflows required to fuel quasar activity produce large obscuring columns , and so column densities are correlated with quasar luminosity .",
    "the basic picture of buried quasar activity associated with the early growth of supermassive black holes and starburst activity has been proposed previously and studied for some time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but our modeling allows us to describe the evolution of obscuration in a self - consistent manner , defining obscured and unobscured phases appropriately and identifying dynamical correlations between the column density distribution and instantaneous and peak luminosities .",
    "there is substantial observational support for this picture .",
    "point - like x - ray sources have been observed in many bright sub - millimeter or infrared and starburst sources , with essentially all very luminous infrared galaxies showing evidence of buried quasar activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , indicating simultaneous buried black hole growth and star formation at redshifts corresponding to peak quasar activity ( @xmath414 ) @xcite .",
    "the buried black holes in high - z starbursting galaxies appear to be active but undermassive compared to the quiescent galaxy black hole - stellar mass relation @xcite , implying that they are rapidly growing in the starburst but have not yet reached their final masses , presumably set in the subsequent `` blowout '' phase .",
    "similarly , observations suggest that obscured agn are significantly more likely to exhibit strong sub - millimeter emission characteristic of star formation , implying both that obscured black hole growth and star formation are correlated and that obscuration mechanisms ( responsible for re - radiation in the submm and ir ) may be primarily isotropic in at least some cases ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "while our resolution limits prevent our ruling out the possibility of gas collapse to a dense , @xmath430pc scale torus surrounding the black hole , during the peak obscured phases of the final merger , our simulations indicate that these large scales dominate the contribution to the column density , with quite large columns , which should be observationally testable .",
    "indeed , this is suggested by the typical scales of obscuration in starbursting systems ( e.g.  soifer et al .  1984a , b ; sanders et al .",
    "1986 , 1988a , b ; for a review , see e.g.  soifer et al .",

    "observations of polarized light in intrinsically bright type ii agn with unobscured luminosities typical of quasars ( as opposed to local , dim seyfert ii objects in relaxed hosts ) show scattering on large scales @xmath348kpc , and in some cases obscuration clearly generated over scales extending beyond the host galaxy in the form of distortions , tidal tails , and streams from interactions and major mergers @xcite .",
    "the angular structure seen in these observations is consistent with our modeling . moreover , in optically faint x - ray quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) it appears that obscuration is generated by the host galaxies , and is directly related to host galaxy morphologies and line - of - sight distance through the host .",
    "the critical point is that , regardless of the angular structure of obscuration , typical column densities are strongly evolving functions of time , luminosity , and host system properties , and the observed distribution of column densities is dominated by these effects , not by differences in viewing angle across a uniform population .",
    "this is the case in our modeling as the lognormal dispersion ( across different lines of sight ) in column densities is @xmath627 for a given simulation at some instant , whereas typical column densities across simulations , as a function of instantaneous and peak luminosities , span several orders of magnitude from @xmath628 .",

    "this should provide a basis for comparison with a wide range of observations , with the most important prediction being that the quasar lifetime should increase with decreasing luminosity .",
    "* for a reasonably complete , optically selected sample above some luminosity , the distribution of observed column densities should broaden to both larger and smaller @xmath89  values as the minimum observed luminosity is decreased , as both intrinsically faint periods with low column density and intrinsically bright periods with high column density become observable .",
    "* similarly , the eddington ratio distribution should be a function of observed luminosity , with a broad distribution of eddington ratios down to @xmath643 at luminosities well below the break in the observed luminosity function , and a more strongly peaked distribution about @xmath456 for luminosities above the break ( figure  [ fig : pofl.all ] ) . * in our interpretation ,",
    "the bright and faint ends of the luminosity function correspond statistically to similar mixes of galaxies , but in various stages of evolution ; whereas in all other competing scenarios , the quasar luminosity is directly related to the mass of the host galaxy .",
    "therefore , any observational probe that differentiates quasars based on their host galaxy properties such as , for example , the dependence of the clustering of quasars on luminosity , or the host stellar mass and size as a function of luminosity ( although we caution that this is somewhat dependent of the modeling of star formation in mergers ) , can be used to discriminate our picture from older models .",
    "we present a detailed prediction of the quasar correlation function based on our modeling for comparison with observations in @xcite . *",
    "our distribution @xmath36 directly translates to a black hole merger rate , as a function of mass , in our modeling , allowing a detailed prediction of the gravitational wave signal from black hole mergers as a function of redshift .",
    "* the broad line fraction as a function of luminosity , defined by requiring that `` broad - line '' objects have an observed b - band luminosity above a fraction @xmath361 of that of their host galaxy , is a prediction of our model quasar and galaxy light curves .",
    "however , the uncertainties are large , primarily because different observational samples have varying sensitivity to quasar vs.  host galaxy optical light .",
    "furthermore , the host galaxy gas fraction and @xmath361 are degenerate in these predictions  a well - defined observational sample complete to some @xmath361 can constrain our modeling of quasar fueling and the relation between quasar and host galaxy light curves . in particular , such observations , either by measuring the faint - end shape of the `` broad - line '' quasar luminosity function or the mean `` broad - line '' fraction at a given luminosity as a function of redshift , can constrain the gas fractions of quasar host galaxies and their evolution , essentially a free parameter in our empirical modeling . *",
    "we also predict the distribution of active , low - redshift black hole masses in   [ sec : blqso ] .",
    "these predictions can be compared to mass functions for active black holes from numerous quasar surveys , which should include improved mass functions of the entire quasar population complete to lower luminosities as well as future mass functions for the population of active broad - line agn .",
    "we provide predictions for the black hole mass function of all active quasars , and for just the `` broad - line '' population ( as a function of the survey selection ) . *",
    "because the evolution of spheroids and supermassive black holes is linked in our modeling , with each affecting the evolution of the other , we can also use the distribution of observed quasar properties to predict galaxy properties such as number counts , spheroid masses and luminosities , and colors as a function of redshift . for the calculation and discussion of these predictions , see @xcite . * in our model , the growth of supermassive black holes",
    "is dominated by galaxy mergers .",
    "therefore , at any given redshift , the mass ( and as a consequence , luminosity ) function of galaxy mergers should have a similar shape to our distribution of quasar birthrates , @xmath36 , distinct from the shapes of either the quasar or total galaxy luminosity functions .",

    "we have used our modeling and the conditional probability distributions for these quantities from our simulations to generate monte carlo realizations of quasar populations , which we provide publicly via ftp .    at a particular redshift",
    ", we use our fitted @xmath36 distribution and our suite of simulations to generate a random population of mock `` quasars . ''",
    "we first generate the peak luminosities of each `` quasar '' according to the fitted @xmath36 at that redshift . for each object",
    ", we then use the probability of being at a given instantaneous luminosity in simulations with a similar peak luminosity to generate a current bolometric luminosity . in practice",
    ", we calculate the @xmath644 distribution by summing @xmath645 , where @xmath12 is the mock quasar peak luminosity , @xmath646 is the peak luminosity of each simulation and @xmath647 is a gaussian weighting factor ( @xmath648 ) . knowing the instantaneous bolometric luminosity @xmath13 and peak luminosity @xmath12 , we then follow an identical procedure to determine the joint distribution @xmath649 of each subsequent quantity @xmath650 , from simulations with similar @xmath13 and @xmath12 .",
    "we have compared this with monte carlo realizations based on our fitted probability distributions in this paper , and find that essentially identical results are achieved for e.g.  the distribution of @xmath13 and @xmath12 , and column densities in phases of growth not near peak luminosity . however ,",
    "this modeling is not identical for e.g.  the distribution of eddington ratios and column densities around @xmath415 , which reflects the fact that our fits to the eddington ratio distribution (   [ sec : eddington ] ) are rough and that our fits to the column density distribution do not apply to the final `` blowout '' phase of quasar evolution ( as discussed in detail in   [ sec : blqso ] ) .    for each mock quasar",
    ", we generate a peak luminosity , final ( post - merger ) black hole mass , instantaneous bolometric luminosity , intrinsic ( un - attenuated ) b - band ( @xmath651 at @xmath652 ) , soft x - ray ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) , and hard x - ray ( 2 - 10 kev ) luminosity , observed ( attenuated using the generated column density and the reddening / dust extinction modeling described in   [ sec : nh ] , with smc - like reddening curves and extinction following e.g.  pei 1992 , morrison & mccammon 1983 ) b - band , soft x - ray , and hard x - ray luminosities , column density of neutral hydrogen , column density of neutral+ionized hydrogen , and instantaneous black hole mass . the intrinsic luminosities in each band are calculated using the bolometric corrections described in @xcite , which account for the luminosity dependence of the optical - to - x - ray luminosity ratio @xmath305 ( as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : fulllf ] ) , and then attenuated to give the observed luminosities .",
    "we also provide intrinsic and attenuated luminosities in each waveband using the constant bolometric corrections of @xcite , but we caution that these are not calculated in a completely self - consistent manner , as our assumed bolometric luminosity function to which we fit the @xmath36 distribution is based on using the luminosity - dependent bolometric corrections .",
    "we do not directly calculate eddington ratios , as these are defined differently in many observed samples , but they should be calculable with the given luminosities and black hole masses .",
    "we calculate these quantities for a mock sample of @xmath653 quasars at each redshift @xmath654 .",
    "most of these quasars are at luminosities orders of magnitude below those observed , therefore for space considerations and because our predictions become uncertain at low luminosities , we retain only the @xmath655 quasars with brightest bolometric luminosities at each redshift .",
    "this introduces some uncertainty in our statistics at the lowest luminosities in any given band , but these luminosities are generally still well below those observed in most samples . at any luminosity , but especially at the brightest luminosities , there is also a significant amount of effective `` noise '' owing to our incomplete sampling of the enormous parameter space of possible mergers , and decreasing total time across simulations spent at large luminosities , which can be estimated from e.g.figures  [ fig : lf.hists ] and [ fig : ueda.bl ] . finally , at each redshift , we generate two distributions , reflecting the @xmath453 range in @xmath36 , and roughly parameterizing the degeneracies in our fit to the observed luminosity functions and uncertainty in the faint - end of @xmath36  `` fit 1 '' has a lower @xmath265 ( lower peak in @xmath36 ) , with a larger @xmath266 ( broader @xmath36 distribution ) , and `` fit 2 '' has a higher @xmath265 and smaller @xmath266 ( more narrowly peaked @xmath36 distribution ) .",
    "we show a few example `` quasars '' from our @xmath656 mock distribution in table  [ tbl : montecarlo ] , to demonstrate the format and units used .",
    "although we do not yet model the re - radiation of absorbed light by dust or the contribution of stellar light to quasar host ir luminosities , including these in our picture for quasar evolution will enable us to predict luminosity functions in the ir and sub - mm and their evolution with redshift .",
    "we can at this point , however , estimate if our model for quasar lifetimes and merger - driven evolution with @xmath36 is consistent with the observed distribution of ultraluminous infrared galaxies .",
    "naively , we might expect that since the obscured quasar phase has a duration up to @xmath135 times that of the optically observable quasar phase , there should be @xmath135 times as many ulirgs as bright optical qsos .",
    "but , this neglects the complicated , luminosity dependent nature of quasar lifetimes .",
    "given that the bright quasars we simulate attain , during their peak growth phase , an intrinsic luminosity comparable to that of the host starburst , and that this period of peak growth has a similar duration to the starburst phase ( see figure  [ fig : bl.in.sims ] and * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we can estimate ( roughly ) the ulirg bolometric luminosity function from our bolometric quasar luminosity function .",
    "thus , the more accurate comparison to the ulirg luminosity function is with the hard x - ray quasar luminosity function , as this recovers ( and at some luminosities can be dominated by ) `` buried '' quasars in starburst phases .",
    "this is only applicable _ above _ the break in the luminosity function , where quasars are undergoing peak quasar growth . below the break , quasars are , on average , sub - eddington and can have luminosities well below that of their star - forming hosts ( see figure  [ fig : bl.in.sims ] ) , so we expect our quasar luminosity function to be significantly shallower than the ulirg luminosity function at these luminosities .",
    "note also that this does not imply that ulirgs are all agn - dominated , as the starburst and peak agn activity can be ( and generally are ) somewhat offset , but only says that the lifetime curves at the bright end should be similar .",
    "considering the luminosity function at @xmath657 , then , we expect ulirg densities @xmath658 at @xmath659 and @xmath660 , respectively .",
    "these estimates are consistent with the observed density in the _ iras _ 1 jy survey @xcite at a mean redshift @xmath657 , with @xmath661 ( rescaled to our cosmology ) , and as expected , our quasar luminosity function slope becomes significantly shallower than the observed 1 jy survey luminosity function slope below @xmath662 , roughly the break luminosity of the luminosity function .",
    "we predict these densities to change with redshift according to the evolution of @xmath36 , decreasing by a factor @xmath663 at @xmath664 , in good agreement with the evolution of iras ulirg luminosity functions @xcite .",
    "likewise , at @xmath665 , we predict a mean space density @xmath666 , in agreement with the @xmath667 density of such sources expected to reproduce the observed cumulative source density @xmath668 of 1mjy @xmath669 scuba sources @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our prediction of the fraction of buried agn and its evolution with redshift agrees well with determinations from x - ray samples @xcite and recent spitzer results in the mid and near - infrared at @xmath309 @xcite .",
    "some low redshift quasars ( e.g.  bahcall et al .  1996 ) and many nearby , low - luminosity seyferts appear to reside in ordinary , relatively undisturbed galaxies .",
    "our picture for quasar evolution does not immediately account for these objects because we suppose that nuclear activity is mainly triggered by tidal torques during a merger .",
    "this work is primarily concerned with the origin of the majority of the mass in spheroids and supermassive black holes , and as a consequence , the relation of this to the abundance and evolution of quasars and the cosmic x - ray background .",
    "based on our present analysis , we believe that a merger - driven picture can account for the main part of each of these , and , as described earlier , that the most relevant phase in the history of the universe to these phenomena appears to have been at moderate redshifts , @xmath619 to @xmath620 .",
    "our model does not exclude other mechanisms for triggering agn and it is likely that a variety of stochastic or continuous processes are relevant to nuclear activity in undisturbed disks and residual low - level accretion in relaxed systems .",
    "this is not contrary to our picture because most of the total black hole mass density in the universe is in spheroid - dominated systems .",
    "the principal requirement of our model is that agn activity in undisturbed galaxies should not contribute a large fraction of the black hole mass density in the universe , to avoid spoiling tight correlations between the black hole and host galaxy properties and producing too large a present - day black hole mass density in violation of the soltan ( 1982 ) constraint .",
    "for example , if a molecular cloud passed through the center of our galaxy near sgr a@xmath670 , it is possible that the milky way would resemble a seyfert for some period of time .",
    "alternatively , it has long been recognized that mass loss from normal stellar evolution of bulge stars or stellar clusters near the centers of galaxies can provide a continuous supply of fuel for low - level accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "typical galactic stellar mass loss rates ( @xmath671 ) yield bondi - hoyle accretion rates @xmath672 of eddington in relaxed , dynamically hot systems ; and mass loss rates from o and w - r stars ( @xmath673 ) in young , dense star clusters near the centers of galaxies with sufficient cold gas for continued star formation can yield rates as high as @xmath674 of eddington .    even though these fueling mechanisms do not involve mergers ,",
    "the scenario we have discussed might still be relevant to the origin of these black holes .",
    "of course , the black holes and spheroids in disk - dominated systems may have produced in a manner that did not involve mergers .",
    "alternatively , most of the black hole mass in these objects ( which is small compared to that in spheroid - dominated galaxies ) could have been assembled long ago in mergers with bright quasar phases and then these `` dead '' quasars are resurrected sporadically by other fueling mechanisms .",
    "independent of how these black holes were formed , elements of our modeling may still account for certain observed properties of seyferts .",
    "the observed seyfert luminosity function appears to join smoothly onto the quasar luminosity function @xcite .",
    "it is not obvious that this would be the case if the two types of objects are produced by entirely distinct mechanisms . in addressing this , it is useful to separate the process by which gas is delivered to the black hole from the subsequent evolution that determines the observed activity . in our picture ,",
    "gas is delivered to the black hole by gravitational torques during a merger , but other mechanisms , like bar - induced fueling may be important for objects such as seyferts .",
    "regardless , the induced activity may be generic , if black hole growth is self - regulated in the way we describe it in our simulations .    in hopkins et al .",
    "( 2005f ) we show that the faint end slope of the quasar luminosity function in our model is partly determined by the time dependence of the `` blowout '' phase of black hole growth .",
    "we derive an analytical model for this using a sedov - taylor type analysis and show that the impact of this feedback depends on the mass of the host .",
    "this analysis does not depend on the fueling mechanism , only on the subsequent evolution .",
    "if this self - regulated growth applies to seyferts as well ( for example if seyfert growth is regulated by a balance between accretion feedback and the spheroid potential , as expected if these objects obey a similar @xmath25 relation ) , we would expect the seyfert luminosity function to smoothly join onto the quasar one , even if the fuel is delivered in a different manner .",
    "we have studied the evolution of quasars in simulations of galaxy mergers spanning a wide region of parameter space . in agreement with earlier work @xcite , we find that the lifetime of a particular source depends on luminosity and increases at lower luminosities , and that quasar obscuration is time - dependent .",
    "our new , large set of simulations shows that the lifetime and obscuration can be expressed in terms of the instantaneous and peak luminosities of a quasar and that these descriptions are robust , with no systematic dependence on simulation parameters .",
    "we have combined these results with a semi - empirical method to describe the cosmological distribution of quasar properties , allowing us to predict a large number of observables as a function of e.g.  luminosity and redshift .",
    "this approach also makes it possible to compare our picture to simpler models for quasar lifetimes and obscuration .    in the model",
    "we examine , quasars are triggered by mergers of gas - rich galaxies , which produce inflows of gas through gravitational torquing , fueling starbursts and rapid black hole growth .",
    "the large gas densities obscure the central black hole at optical wavelengths until feedback energy from the growth of the black hole ejects gas and rapidly slows further accretion ( `` blowout '' ) .",
    "quasar lifetimes and light curves are non - trivial , with strong accretion activity during first passage of the merging galaxies and extended quiescent ( sub - eddington ) phases leading into and out of the phase of peak quasar activity associated with the final merger",
    ". the `` blowout '' phase in which the quasar is visible as a bright , near - eddington optical source has a lifetime related to the dynamical time in the inner regions of the merging galaxies , which characterizes the timescale over which obscuring gas and dust are expelled , but the quasar spends a longer time at lower luminosities before and after this stage .",
    "these evolutionary processes have important consequences which can not be captured in models of pure exponential or `` on / off '' quasar growth .",
    "our work emphasizes several goals for quasar and galaxy observations and theory .",
    "observationally , it is important to constrain the faint end of the _ peak _ luminosity distribution ; i.e.  the low - mass active black hole distribution .",
    "unfortunately , our modeling of quasar lifetimes implies that the faint - end quasar luminosity function is dominated by quasars with peak luminosities around the break in the luminosity function , and can provide only weak constraints on the faint - end @xmath12 distribution .",
    "however , there is still hope , as for example broad - line quasar activity is more closely associated with near - peak luminosities , and thus probing the faint - end of broad - line luminosity functions may in particular improve the estimates .",
    "moreover , studies of the black hole mass distribution ( or the distribution of galaxy spheroids ) as a function of redshift , extending to small spheroid masses / velocity dispersions probes the faint end of @xmath36 .",
    "other techniques , such as studies of faint radio sources at high redshift @xcite can similarly constrain these populations . furthermore",
    ", the calculations in this paper can be combined to better determine @xmath36 , as , given a model for the quasar lifetime and obscuration , they all derive from this fundamental quantity .",
    "additional observational tests of the modeling we have presented will provide an important means of constraining models for agn accretion and feedback ; for example , the faint - end slope of the quasar lifetime depends on how the `` blowout '' phase occurs and could provide a sensitive probe of feedback models , enabling the adoption of more realistic and sophisticated feedback prescriptions than we have thus far employed .",
    "of course , improved constraints on the luminosity function at all luminosities at high redshift remains a valuable means of testing theories of quasar evolution .",
    "our simulations are based on isolated galaxy mergers , and thus do not provide a cosmological prediction for the distribution of peak luminosities @xmath36 , merger rates , or mass functions - we instead have adopted a semi - empirical model , in which we use our modeling of quasar evolution to determine these distributions from the observed luminosity function .",
    "while this allows us to predict a large number of observables and to demonstrate that a wide range of quasar and galaxy properties are self - consistent in a model of merger - driven quasar activity with realistic quasar lifetimes , future theoretical work in these areas should predict the distribution of peak luminosities @xmath36 and its evolution with redshift .",
    "these quantities are to be distinguished from the distribution of observed luminosities , as the two are not trivially related in our model or any other with a non - trivial quasar lifetime .",
    "although the quasar birthrate as a function of peak luminosity will be , in general , a complicated function of galaxy merger rates , gas fractions , morphologies , and other factors , we have parameterized it for comparison with the results of future cosmological simulations and semi - analytical models .",
    "this distribution is particularly valuable as a theoretical quantity because it is more directly related to physical galaxy properties than even the complete ( intrinsic ) luminosity function , and additionally because theoretical modeling which successfully reproduces this @xmath36 distribution is guaranteed to reproduce the large number of observable quantities we have discussed in detail in this work .",
    "we can not determine the cosmological context in our detailed simulations of the relatively small - scale physics of galaxy mergers , and conversely , cosmological simulations and semi - analytical models can not resolve the detailed physics driving quasar activity in mergers",
    ". however , our determination of quasar evolution as a function of peak luminosity or final black hole mass can be grafted onto these cosmological models to greatly increase the effective dynamic range of such calculations .",
    "combined with our modeling , this would remove the one significant empirical element we have adopted , and allow for a complete prediction of the above quantities from a single theoretical framework .    in these efforts ,",
    "we emphasize that the mergers relevant to our picture are of a specific type .",
    "first , the merging galaxies must contain a supply of cold gas in a rotationally supported disk . hot , diffuse gas , as in the halos of elliptical galaxies , will not be subject to the gravitational torques which drive gas into galaxy centers and fuel black hole growth .",
    "clearly , gas - poor mergers are also not important for this process .",
    "second , the mergers will likely involve galaxies of comparable , although not necessarily equal , mass , so that the gravitational torques excited are strong enough and penetrate deep enough into galaxy centers to drive substantial inflows of gas .",
    "the precise requirement for the mass ratio is somewhat ill - defined because it also depends on the orbit geometry , but mergers with a mass ratio larger than @xmath675 are probably not generally important to our model .",
    "simulations of minor mergers involving galaxies with mass ratios @xmath676 ( e.g.  hernquist 1989 ; hernquist & mihos 1995 ) have shown that for particular orbital geometries , these events can produce starbursts similar to those in major mergers , leaving behind disturbed remnants with dynamically heated disks ( e.g.quinn et al .",
    "1993 ; mihos et al .  1995 ; walker et al .",
    "it is of interest to establish whether black hole growth can also be triggered in minor mergers , as these events may be relevant to weak agn activity like that in some seyfert galaxies or liners .    in summary ,",
    "the work presented here supports the conjecture that many aspects of galaxy formation and evolution can be understood in terms of the `` cosmic cycle '' in figure  [ fig : cosmiccycle ] . to be sure , much of what is summarized in figure  [",
    "fig : cosmiccycle ] has been proposed elsewhere , either in the context of observations or theoretical models .",
    "our modeling of galaxy formation and evolution emphasizes the possibility that supermassive black holes could be _ responsible _ for much of what goes on in shaping galaxies , rather than being bystanders , closing the loop in figure  [ fig : cosmiccycle ] . in this sense",
    ", black holes may be the `` prime movers '' driving galaxy evolution , as has been proposed earlier for extragalactic radio sources ( e.g.  begelman , blandford & rees 1984 ; rees 1984 ) .",
    "it may seem counterintuitive that compact objects with masses much smaller than those of galaxies could have such an impact , but it is precisely the concentrated nature of matter in black holes that makes this idea plausible .    consider a black hole of mass @xmath3 at the center of a spherical galaxy of mass @xmath677 with a characteristic velocity dispersion @xmath4 .",
    "the energy available to affect the galaxy through the growth of the black hole will be some small fraction of its rest - mass , @xmath678 .",
    "this can be compared with the binding energy of the galaxy , @xmath679 .",
    "observations indicate that @xmath3 and @xmath677 are correlated and that , roughly @xmath680 ( magorrian et al .  1998 ; marconi & hunt 2003 ) .",
    "therefore , the ratio of the feedback energy to the binding energy of the galaxy is @xmath681 , for an assumed efficiency of 1% , @xmath682 and scaling the velocity dispersion to @xmath683 km / sec , as for relatively massive galaxies .",
    "this result demonstrates that the supermassive black holes in the centers of spheroidal galaxies are by far the largest supply of potential energy in these objects , exceeding even the galaxy binding energy . when viewed in this way",
    ", if even a small fraction of the black hole radiant energy can couple to the surrounding ism , then black hole growth is not an implausible mechanism for regulating galaxy formation and evolution ; in fact , it appears almost inevitable that it should play this role .",

    "<S> we develop an evolutionary model for starbursts , quasars , and spheroidal galaxies in which supermassive black holes play a dominant role . in this picture , </S>",
    "<S> mergers between gas - rich galaxies drive nuclear inflows of gas , producing intense starbursts and feeding the growth of supermassive black holes . during this phase , </S>",
    "<S> the black hole is heavily obscured ( a `` buried '' quasar ) , but feedback energy from its growth expels the gas , rendering the black hole briefly visible as a bright , optical source ( a `` visible '' quasar ) , and eventually halting accretion ( a `` dead '' quasar ) . the self - regulated growth of the black hole accounts for the observed correlation between black hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion in spheroidal galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the quasar lifetime and obscuring column density depend on both the instantaneous and peak luminosities of the quasar , and determine this dependence using a large set of simulations of galaxy mergers varying the host galaxy properties , orbital geometry , and gas physics .    </S>",
    "<S> we use our fits to the lifetime and column density to deconvolve observed quasar luminosity functions and obtain the evolution of the formation rate of quasars with a certain peak luminosity , @xmath0 . in our model , quasars spend extended periods of time at luminosities well below their peaks , and so @xmath1 has a maximum , falling off at both brighter and fainter luminosities , corresponding to the `` break '' in the observed quasar luminosity function . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain self - consistent fits to hard and soft x - ray and optical quasar luminosity functions for a model in which @xmath2 varies with redshift according to pure peak luminosity evolution . from this form for @xmath2 , and our simulation results for the luminosity dependence of the quasar lifetime and obscuring column , we are able to reproduce many observable quantities , including : the column density distribution of both optical and x - ray selected quasar samples , the luminosity function of broad - line quasars in x - ray samples and the broad - line ( type i , type ii ) fraction as a function of luminosity , the mass function of active black holes , the observed distribution of eddington ratios at both low and high redshift , the present - day mass function of relic , inactive supermassive black holes and total black hole mass density , and the spectrum of the cosmic x - ray background . in each case , our predictions agree well with observations , matching them to higher precision than previous tunable models for quasar lifetimes and obscuration similarly fit to the luminosity function . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a library of monte carlo realizations of our modeling for comparison with a wide range of observations , using various selection criteria . </S>"
