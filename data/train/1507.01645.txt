    "the nonequilibrium @xmath2 cross - sections with @xmath23 shown in * figure 1 * look like inhomogenous ( or `` multifractal '' ) strange attractors . and they are . in these flows , as in a wide variety of time - reversible nonequilibrium steady states , the fractal strange attractors satisfy the second law of thermodynamics , with an overall hot - to - cold heat current .",
    "the reversed flows , topologically similar fractals , are mechanically unstable , with exponentially growing phase volume , and with a heat - flow direction violating the second law .",

    "such two - dimensional maps provide relatively simple ( two - dimensional rather than three ) pictures of the chaos generated by the conducting oscillator .    because the penetrations of the differential equations are proportional to the `` flux '' through the sampling plane @xmath26 at @xmath27 , rather than just the `` density '' , there are unoccupied white `` nullclines '' in the cross sections wherever the flux @xmath28 vanishes .",

    "in the dynamical systems literature the discontinuous `` baker map '' , composed of area - preserving cutting and kneading operations , provides a simple illustration of `` chaos '' , the exponentially diverging growth induced by the mapping of small perturbations .",
    "the familiar `` cat map '' is another well - known discontinuous mapping of the unit square into itself .",
    "both these map types illustrate lyapunov instability , @xmath30 , where the proportionality constant exceeds unity , leading to divergence .",

    "is mapped from a @xmath33 rectangle to two @xmath34 disjoint rectangles . in order to follow our criterion for time reversibility  detailed in the next section ",
    "we use a _ rotated _ version of the baker map , illustrated in * figure 2*. the mapping is as follows : +     if(q.lt.p ) then + qnew = + 1.25d00*q - 0.75d00*p +",

    "the conducting oscillator is just one example of the deterministic , time - reversible flows that represent a nonequilibrium steady state with a chaotic multifractal attractor .",
    "the time - reversed state , with the momentum , friction coefficient , and the time all changed in sign , is an exactly similar mirror - image multifractal structure , an unstable zero - measure repellor .",
    "more complicated maps with these same properties can be constructed by concatenating time - symmetric combinations of reversible mappings @xmath40 like @xmath41 where each of the mappings satisfies the time - reversibility criterion : @xmath42 with the four operations performed from right to left . here",

    "the similarities between small - system dynamics and macroscopic dissipative behavior motivate the study of relatively simple flows and maps capable of generating the complexity associated with irreversible strange attractors . at the same time this complexity often exhibits a compelling beauty .",
