    "can take , the negatively - charged nv@xmath0 state possesses optical and magnetic properties favorable to quantum technology applications .",
    "@xcite the electronic spin of a single nv center ( hereafter nv center specifically refers to the nv@xmath0 state ) can be manipulated by microwave at around 2.87  ghz , and be initialized and read out optically owing to the state - dependent fluorescence .",
    "@xcite its long coherence time at room temperature makes it a leading candidate for a ultra - sensitive , nanoscale magnetometer .",
    "@xcite in addition , the both long coherence time and magnetometry have also been realized in ensemble nvs under ambient conditions .",
    "@xcite consequently , nv - based sensing and imaging of magnetic fields , as well as other physical quantities such as temperatures and electric fields , have become an active area of research and are expected to find practical applications not only in physics but also in biology , medical science , planetary science , and so forth .",
    "@xcite    in optically - detected magnetic resonance ( odmr ) experiments of nv centers , a thin straight copper wire or a millimeter - sized loop coil is commonly used to generate an oscillating magnetic field @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite for sensing with ensemble nvs , in which the sensitivity is enhanced by the square - root of the number of spins at the expense of nanoscale resolution , the uniformity of @xmath1 is particularly important . even in sensing with single nvs ,",
    "the starting point is to search a diamond substrate for single nvs by confocal microscopy and odmr .",
    "@xmath2 can be made strong in the vicinity of a wire , but decreases rapidly as departing from it .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath3 generated by a loop coil is more uniform , but tends to be much weaker than that by the wire .",
    "moreover , the both structures are placed in contact with a diamond surface , nearby which an objective lens and/or a specimen to be sensed , varying from inorganic materials to living cells , are necessarily present .",
    "one can not observe , for instance , the region beneath the wire , as it hinders the light propagation .",
    "therefore , it is preferable to leave the surface open as much as possible .",
    "a few microwave circuits for odmr of nv centers that are placed beneath diamond samples have been devised .",
    "et al . _ developed a double split - ring resonator which achieves spatially uniform @xmath3 and efficient coupling to nv centers .",
    "@xcite while the resonator frequency is shown to be tunable within 400  mhz around 2.87  ghz by placing a copper tape near the structure , its moderate quality factor ( @xmath4 70 ) allows only one resonance ( typically @xmath510  mhz linewidth ) within the bandwidth ( 40  mhz ) , making it difficult to simultaneously observe multiple resonances separated by tens to hundreds mhz under weak external magnetic fields .",
    "_ designed a microwave circuit operating between 2.7  ghz and 3.1  ghz with a notable capability of generating arbitrary microwave polarizations .",
    "@xcite a drawback is that the distributions of microwave strength and polarization depend largely on the positions and careful calibrations may be necessary .    in this work",
    ", we aim to design and characterize a microwave planar ring antenna that addresses above - mentioned limitations .",
    "the design targets of our antenna are as follows ; ( i ) it is placed beneath a diamond sample , thereby does not interfere with the objective lens or the specimen .",
    "( ii ) it generates @xmath3 spatially uniform within an area of about 1  mm@xmath6 , which covers large parts of typical diamond samples .",
    "( iii ) it has a resonance frequency at around 2.87  ghz and a bandwidth of a few 100  mhz ( @xmath7  10 ) so that multiple resonances can be addressed .",

    "to impedance - match with instrumental 50  @xmath22 , the width of the 23-mm - long feed line is consecutively varied from 3.3  mm ( sma connector side ) to 0.54  mm ( ring edge ) . ]",
    "our ring resonator is regarded as a single - loop coil surrounding a circular hole , inside of which resonant magnetic fields are concentrated .",
    "@xcite to help intuitive understanding of the design , we model the structure as a simple series lcr circuit .",
    "the inductance @xmath23 arises from the circular hole : @xmath24 .",
    "the capacitance @xmath25 is formed by the gap : @xmath26 .",
    "the constriction connecting the upper and lower half circles will contribute to the resistance : @xmath27 .",
    "then , the resonance frequency @xmath28 and the quality factor @xmath29 are proportional to @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "these expressions , although very naive , indicate that small @xmath10 and large @xmath9 are desirable to achieve low @xmath32 , which is our design target ( iii ) .",
    "practically , the minimum achievable @xmath10 is limited by our manufacturing accuracy of 0.1  mm .    in relation to our design targets ( i ) and ( ii ) ,",
    "the primary consideration is the sample size .",
    "typical diamond substrates are 1 to 5  mm on a side with thickness @xmath33 of around 0.5  mm . as the nv centers existing near the top surface are used for sensing , we are mainly concerned with the distribution of @xmath3 about 0.5  mm above the antenna surface .",
    "we find @xmath8 comparable with @xmath33 is advantageous to deliver spatially uniform and strong @xmath3 to the diamond surface .",
    "we thus limit @xmath8 to be around 0.5  mm , and adjust the remaining design parameters @xmath34 and @xmath9 to tune @xmath35 and @xmath36 to the desired values , using three - dimensional electromagnetic simulation software cst microwave studio^^. in the simulation , we set the width and thickness of diamond as @xmath11 = 2.2  mm and @xmath14 = 0.51  mm , respectively , to coincide with the actual size of the diamond sample used for @xmath37-parameter and odmr measurements below .",

    "i.e. _ , the tilt angle from the z axis , as @xmath43 which is shown in the right - hand side of fig .  [ fig2](a ) .",
    "the x and y components are very small ( @xmath44 0@xmath45 ) in the center region and increase towards the peripheral of the hole ( @xmath44 30@xmath45 ) .",

    "the fluorescence decreases at the resonance , giving a series of dips .",
    "the contrast is given as the ratio between the data with the microwave on and off in order to cancel out the background .",
    "the eight dips characteristic of ensemble nvs are clearly observed .",

    "as @xmath72 is made closer to 90@xmath45 , the off - diagonal term with @xmath74 becomes non - negligible and the nonlinearity in the evolution of transition frequencies is more pronounced .",
    "the observations here demonstrate that under the external magnetic field up to 100  g or so , which is a typical condition for nv - based sensing and imaging experiments ,  @xcite our antenna does not require an adjustment of its resonance frequency by external perturbations ( such as placing a copper tape as in the case of ref .  ) .",
    "next , we carry out pulsed odmr to observe rabi oscillations and examine the oscillating magnetic field generated by the antenna .",

    "is a coplanar waveguide matched to 50  @xmath22 with the width of the center line of 2  mm and the gaps of 1  mm .",
    "the center line is removed beneath diamond , and instead a 30-@xmath75m - diameter copper wire bridges the two ends of the center line .",

    "the origin of the coordinate is set at the center of the diamond surface . as mentioned in section  [ intro ] , @xmath3 is strong near the wire , but weakens as the inverse of the distance from the wire ( ampre s law ) .",
    "the coil produces more or less uniform @xmath3 inside of the loop , but the strength is much weaker .",
    "the antenna combines the both features .",
    "it is also worth noting that @xmath3 of the antenna becomes stronger inside of the diamond .",
    "this is advantageous when nv centers deep inside the substrate are investigated , which is important for materials characterization as well as for quantum information processing .",
    "when the nv electronic spins are used as quantum bits , the depth from the substrate may be less critical than in sensing application , and the deep nv centers may be preferred for their stability and longer coherence times .",
    "in conclusion , we have designed and characterized a microwave planar ring antenna suitable for odmr of nv centers in diamond .",
    "it has the resonance frequency at around 2.87  ghz with the bandwidth of 400  mhz , ensuring that odmr can be observed under external magnetic fields up to 100  g without the need of adjustment of the resonance frequency .",
    "it is also spatially uniform within the 1-mm - diameter hole , enabling the magnetic - field imaging in the wide spatial range . for imaging experiments , with a piezoelectric actuators one can scan a few 100@xmath6  @xmath75m@xmath6 areas and with a galvanometric mirror",
    "even larger areas can be scanned .",
