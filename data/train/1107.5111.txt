    "dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) and confinement are two fundamental features of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "it is generally believed that with increasing temperature and baryon number density strongly interacting matter will undergo a phase transition from the hadronic matter to the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) which is expected to appear in the ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "these two phases are generally referred to as the nambu - goldstone phase which is characterized by dcsb and confinement of dressed quarks and the wigner phase corresponding to qgp in which chiral symmetry is partially restored and quarks are not confined .",
    "theoretically , these two phases are described by two different solutions , the nambu - goldstone solution and the wigner solution of the quark gap equation .",
    "the existence of these two solutions in the chiral limit ( the current quark mass @xmath0 ) has been shown in the framework of dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) approach of qcd ( see , for example , @xcite ) . however , it is a general conclusion in the previous literature that when the current quark mass @xmath1 is nonzero , the quark gap equation has only one solution which corresponds to the nambu - goldstone phase and the solution corresponding to the wigner phase does not exist @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is hard to understand and one will naturally ask why the wigner solution of the quark gap equation only exists in the chiral limit while does not exist at finite current quark mass .",
    "furthermore , this conclusion is in fact not compatible with the current study of chiral phase transition of qcd . in order to see this more clearly ,",
    "let us have a look at the generally accepted qcd phase diagram ( see , for example , fig .",
    "as is shown in the qcd phase diagram , it is generally believed that at low temperature and high baryon number density the chiral phase transition of qcd is of first order and the co - existence of the nambu - goldstone phase and the wigner phase should appear .",
    "it is well - known that in the real world the current quark mass is nonzero .",
    "if one can not find the wigner solution of the quark gap equation in the case of nonzero current quark mass , this will mean that we can not talk about the co - existence of these two phases .",
    "this is obviously an unsettled and important problem in the study of qcd phase transitions .",
    "the authors of ref . @xcite first discussed this problem and asked whether the quark gap equation has a wigner solution in the case of nonzero current quark mass .",
    "subsequently , the authors of refs . @xcite further investigated the problem of possible multi - solutions of the quark gap equation .",
    "however , as far as we know , this problem has not been solved satisfactorily in the literature . in the present paper",
    "we try to propose a new approach to investigate this problem .",
    "the main motivation of the present work is to study the wigner solution of the quark gap equation at finite current quark mass and provide a new viewpoint on partial restoration of chiral symmetry at finite chemical potential .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "ii we analyze the reason why in the previous literature the wigner solution of the quark gap equation does not exist in the case of the finite current quark mass and propose a new approach to discuss this question . in sect .",
    "iii , based on such an approach , we show in the framework of nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model that the quark dse has a wigner solution at finite current quark mass .",
    "then , in sect iv we generalize this approach to the case of finite chemical potential to study partial restoration of chiral symmetry and compare our results with the corresponding ones in previous literature .",
    "the results are summarized in sect . v.",
    "in order to illustrate our new approach more clearly , let us now briefly recall the usual arguments which exclude the existence of the wigner solution of the quark gap equation when @xmath2 .",
    "the quark dse under rainbow approximation reads as following ( in the present paper we will always work in euclidean space , and take the number of flavours , @xmath3 and the number of colours , @xmath4 ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the dressed quark propagator , @xmath7 is the free quark propagator , @xmath8 is the strong coupling constant and @xmath9 is the effective dressed gluon propagator .",
    "according to lorentz structure analysis , one has @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are scalar functions of @xmath13 . substituting eqs .",
    "( [ quark1 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ gap1 ] ) , one has @xmath14p^2&=&\\frac{4}{3}\\int\\frac{d^4q}{(2\\pi)^4 } \\frac{g^2d(p - q)a(q^2)}{q^2a^2(q^2)+b^2(q^2)}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\left[p\\cdot q+2\\frac{p\\cdot(p - q)q\\cdot(p - q)}{(p - q)^2}\\right]\\label{quark2},\\\\ b(p^2)&=&m+\\int\\frac{d^4q}{(2\\pi)^4 } \\frac{4g^2d(p - q)b(q^2)}{q^2a^2(q^2)+b^2(q^2)},\\label{quark3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where landau gauge has been employed . from eqs .",
    "( [ quark2 ] ) and ( [ quark3 ] ) one can find when @xmath0 there are two distinct solutions for @xmath12 .",
    "one solution is @xmath15 which describes the nambu phase , and the other one is @xmath16 which describes the wigner phase .",
    "however , when @xmath2 , it can be easily seen that @xmath16 is not a solution of eqs .",
    "( [ quark2 ] ) and ( [ quark3 ] ) . from this observation one often concludes that when @xmath2 , the quark dse has only one solution corresponding to the nambu phase and the wigner solution does not exist .",
    "here , it should be noted that in obtaining this conclusion one has assumed that the dressed gluon propagators in these two phases are the same .",
    "however , since the features of these two phases are so different , it is reasonable to expect that the behavior of the dressed gluon propagator should be different in these two phases ( for example , in the familiar liquid - solid phase transition of water , the effective interactions between molecules are different in the two phases ) . to see this more clearly ,",
    "let us look at the graphical representation of the dse for the dressed gluon propagator given in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .        from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] it can be seen that the quark propagator can affect the gluon propagator through quark - loop insertions .",
    "therefore , in principle , since the quark propagators in nambu phase and wigner phase are quite different , one naturally expects that the gluon propagators in these two phases should be different , too .",
    "here we would like to stress that this observation is model independent .",
    "besides , this observation has been verified in the study of quantum electrodynamics in @xmath17 dimensions ( qed@xmath18 ) by using the coupled dse for the fermion and photon propagators with a range of fermion - photon vertices @xcite ( qed@xmath18 has many features similar to qcd , such as spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the massless fermion limit and confinement . due to these reasons it can serve as a toy model of qcd ) .",
    "this indicates that one should choose different forms of gluon propagator as input to solve the quark propagators in the two different phases .",
    "now , the key problem is how to choose appropriate model gluon propagators as input to calculate the dressed quark propagator in the nambu phase and the wigner phase , respectively .    from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] it can be seen that one can formally split the full gluon propagator into two parts as following @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the pure yang - mills part which includes all diagrams without quark loop insertions ( which is usually called quenched gluon propagator in lattice qcd ) and @xmath21 is the quark - affected part which includes all diagrams with quark loop insertions . obviously , the pure yang - mills part in wigner phase should be same as that in nambu phase , whereas in principle the quark - affected parts in these two phases should be different . at present",
    "it is impossible to calculate the two parts @xmath22 and @xmath23 from first principle of qcd .",
    "so one has to resort to various nonperturbative qcd models to express them phenomenologically .    over the past few years",
    ", considerable progress has been made in the framework of the qcd sum rule @xcite , which provides a successful description of various nonperturbative aspects of strong interaction physics .",
    "we naturally expect that it might provide some useful clue to the study of the model gluon propagator . from the qcd sum rule approach the lowest - order contribution of quark condensate to the gluon propagator",
    "is @xcite @xmath24\\nonumber\\\\ & \\sim&-\\delta_{\\mu\\nu}\\frac{mg^2\\langle\\bar\\psi\\psi\\rangle}{3p^2}+\\cdots , \\label{gluon3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the non - local quark condensate and @xmath26 is the ordinary two - quark condensate , the ellipsis represents terms of higher orders in @xmath27 which we neglect in the present work since we limit our discussion to two light flavors @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "it is evident that the value of quark condensate @xmath30 is different in the nambu phase and wigner phase .",
    "this makes the gluon propagators in these two phases be different .",
    "therefore , in the following calculation we can phenomenologically identify @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ gluon3 ] ) as a good approximation of the @xmath23 part in eq .",
    "( [ gluon2 ] ) .",
    "now , we should specify a model framework to calculate the quark propagators in nambu phase and the wigner phase .",
    "the dressed quark propagators are the most elementary of the n - point green functions of qcd .",
    "it is evident that the dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) are the natural tool for investigating it in the continuum .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that dses are capable to describe the chiral phase transition and deconfinement phase transition at finite temperatures and chemical potential @xcite . however , as is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model can capture the main physical features of qcd at finite temperature and chemical potential .",
    "for example , partial restoration of chiral symmetry , the critical end point and color superconductivity are all first studied in the framework of the njl model .",
    "this is the reason why the njl model is the most widely used qcd model in the study of qcd phase transition at finite temperature and chemical potential ( although this model has two defects , namely , it can neither accommodate confinement nor is renormalizable ) .",
    "therefore , as a first step , for simplicity in this paper we shall employ the njl model to study the quark propagators in nambu phase and the wigner phase .    in the normal njl model the following model gluon propagator @xmath32 is employed to calculate the quark propagator , where @xmath33 is some effective gluon mass scale and @xmath34 serves as a cutoff and is set to be @xmath35 gev in ref .",
    "this model gluon propagator concentrates on the infrared region of the interaction which is believed to be vital for dcsb of qcd .",
    "with such a model gluon propagator eq .",
    "( [ gap1 ] ) becomes @xmath36 \\gamma_\\mu}{a^2(q^2)q^2+b^2(q^2)}.\\label{gap2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the solution of eq .",
    "( [ gap2 ] ) is @xmath37 and @xmath38 with @xmath39 being a constant satisfying the following equation @xmath40 where @xmath41 $ ] . from eq .",
    "( [ gap3 ] ) it is easy to find that when @xmath42 , this equation has two different solutions in the chiral limit .",
    "however , when @xmath2 , one could only find one solution , the nambu solution , which satisfies @xmath43 .",
    "this result is consistent with the one derived from the analysis of the quark dse under rainbow approximation .",
    "obviously , the vacuum of the wigner phase should be different from that of the nambu phase and their difference can be characterized by the quark condensate which is regarded as the order parameter for chiral phase transition .",
    "therefore , the gluon propagator should be different due to different values of quark condensate in these two phases . in order to reflect this fact",
    ", we introduce the quark condensate contribution ( eq .",
    "( [ gluon3 ] ) ) to the gluon self - energy and modify the effective gluon propagator in the normal njl model as following @xmath44 where the first term in the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ gluon5 ] ) is the usual model gluon propagator employed in the njl model which has the same form in both nambu phase and wigner phase and can be regarded as the pure yang - mills part @xmath45 in the present work ; the second term , which is inspired by the result of qcd sum rules @xcite , is the leading order non - perturbative contribution from quark condensate through quark loop insertions . here , it should be noted that according to the usual approximation of njl model , in obtaining the current quark mass dependent term of eq .",
    "( [ gluon5 ] ) we have taken all the momentum dependence of the effective interaction in momentum space as a constant . for this purpose , we have introduced a momentum scale @xmath46 which reflects the large distance behavior of qcd . for the external momentum squared much larger than @xmath47 the current quark mass dependent term of eq .",
    "( [ gluon5 ] ) can be neglected , whereas for external momentum squared approaching @xmath47 the contribution of quark condensate which has been neglected in the normal njl model must be considered . just as will be shown below , the current mass dependent term in eq .",

    "the value of @xmath33 which accounts for the pure yang - mills gauge field contribution could be fixed by requiring the amount of the intensity of the effective interaction to be @xmath48 for the nambu solution @xmath49 mev which is determined by fitting the observables such as pion decay constant and pion mass ( in the present paper we set the current quark mass @xmath50 mev ) @xcite . with the modified gluon propagator given by eq .",

    "[ fig2 ] @xmath54 is plotted as a function of @xmath39 with different @xmath46 . from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] it can be seen that when @xmath46 is larger than about @xmath55 mev , the equation @xmath53 has only one solution @xmath49 mev , which is similar to the situation discussed in ref .",
    "when @xmath56 mev , the equation @xmath53 has three solutions . specifically , when @xmath57 mev , one solution is the required nambu solution @xmath49 mev , and the other two solutions are all smaller than it ; when @xmath58 , among the two solutions other than the nambu one , one is smaller than it and the other one is larger than it .",
    "here we note that physical observables require the nambu solution to be @xmath49 mev and the stability condition of the nambu solution would exclude the existence of solutions larger than it .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath46 should be constrained within the range @xmath59 .",
    "for @xmath46 in this range , the smallest solution of eq .",
    "( [ gap4 ] ) is not very large compared with the current quark mass , and when the current quark mass @xmath1 tends to zero , this solution will continuously tend to zero , which is just the wigner solution in the chiral limit .",
    "therefore , this solution might be identified as the wigner solution in the case of @xmath60 which describes the perturbative dressing effect .",
    "the result in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows that the scale at which the current quark mass dependent term of eq .",
    "( [ gluon5 ] ) would affect the effective interaction can change the pattern of the solutions of the quark gap equation .",
    "if the current quark mass dependent term plays an important role in the infrared region in the effective interaction ( @xmath56 mev ) , then the intensity of the pure yang - mills field would be weakened and the wigner solution will appear . on the contrary , when @xmath61 mev , the pure yang - mills part would be dominating and strong in the infrared region , and therefore the wigner solution can not exist due to strong interaction . from physical consideration",

    "we will discuss this question in the next section .",
    "now we can generalize the previous treatment to the case of finite density .",
    "the quark propagator at finite quark chemical potential @xmath79 could be expressed as following @xmath80 where @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are scalar functions of @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath79 . with the model gluon propagator in eq .",

    "( [ quark4 ] ) and ( [ quark5 ] ) are numerically solved and the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] one could find the effective mass of the dressed quark in the wigner phase decreases with increasing @xmath79 , which means with increasing density the dressing effect of quarks becomes more and more weak . on the other hand ,",
    "the corresponding one in nambu phase decreases with increasing @xmath79 until @xmath97 mev , and when @xmath98 mev the effective mass of the dressed quark in nambu phase increases with increasing @xmath79 .    in the previous literature ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) one usually employ the maximum of the susceptibility @xmath99 to determine the transition temperature .",
    "in fact , a more reliable criterion for the chiral phase transition is the pressure difference of the nambu phase and the wigner phase , i.e. , the bag constant @xmath100 .",
    "the pressure density of the two solution at finite chemical potential could be calculated as following @xcite @xmath101 where the pressure density of the vacuum @xmath102 can be calculated through eq .",

    "mev the pressure of the two phases is equal and the two phases could co - exist at this point . here",
    "it should be noted that no one has calculated the @xmath100 in the case of nonzero current quark mass in the past .",
    "this is due to lack of knowledge about the wigner solution of the quark gap equation at finite current quark mass in the previous literature .     at finite @xmath79,width=302 ]    here it is interesting to compare our results with those of the normal njl model .",
    "the first - order phase transition point @xmath106 in our modified njl model is smaller than the one obtained in the normal njl model which is about 354 mev or 500 mev corresponding to different parameters @xcite .",
    "it should also be pointed out that in the normal njl model , the second solution appears when @xmath79 is big enough @xcite , but the magnitude of this solution at the phase transition point is much bigger ( about 110 mev or 130 mev , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) than the wigner solution obtained in the present paper ( about 15 mev ) . in addition",
    ", we want to stress that the wigner solution at finite current quark mass in the normal njl model is due to density effect .",
    "when the chemical potential tends to zero , this solution disappears .",
    "this shows @xmath107 is a singularity of the wigner solution at finite current quark mass .",
    "if this is real , it means that one can not study the wigner solution by means of small @xmath79 expansion , while the method of small @xmath79 expansion is a usually employed one in the study of lattice qcd at finite density .",
    "to summarize , based on the general analysis that the dressed gluon propagator in wigner phase should be different from that in nambu phase , we introduce the contribution of quark condensate to the gluon propagator and investigate the solution of quark dse in the case of nonzero current quark mass .",
    "with such a modified model gluon propagator , in the framework of njl model we show that the quark dse indeed has a wigner solution in the case of nonzero current quark mass .",
    "we then generalize this approach to the case of finite chemical potential and discuss partial restoration of chiral symmetry at finite chemical potential . from the calculated result of the bag",
    "constant we find that when @xmath103 mev the nambu solution is more stable and when @xmath104 mev the wigner solution is more stable . at @xmath105",

    "finally we would like to point out that the results obtained in this paper are based on a simple njl model .",
    "it is well - known that the njl model is far from qcd . in order to obtain a more solid result",
