    "dynamical processes on networks remain an ongoing area of research across complex systems of vastly different manifestations : physical , chemical , biological and social / organisational .",
    "the kuramoto model of phase oscillators @xcite on a general network is the most paradigmatic of formulations allowing for a myriad of variations depending on the specific area of application ; for reviews see @xcite . among these",
    ", two variations of the kuramoto model have recently become of interest in the literature : firstly , the _ multi - network _",
    "formulation @xcite , where the entities being modelled on the network nodes may fall into quite different but nonetheless interacting populations ( for example distinct species of organisms ) each with very different network characteristics ; and secondly , the _ frustrated _ kuramoto model , where phase shifts are introduced in the interaction between adjacent oscillators such that the local interaction is not phase but frequency synchronising @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider an intersection of these two variations - a dual - network model , with frustrations introduced in the cross - network interaction .",
    "our interest in such a model stems from our adaptation of the concept of adversarial or competitive interaction in social systems where two ( or more ) populations share a rivalry ( for example , firms for market share @xcite , political or religious parties for membership @xcite , or popular opinion @xcite ) .",
    "note that the kuramoto model has been adapted to social / human systems for several contexts : rhythmic applause @xcite , opinion dynamics @xcite and human - robot musical performance @xcite .",
    "there are also applications of coupled oscillator models on networks in which clustered populations are of interest , such as in the work of @xcite .",
    "our application of the kuramoto model is to the decision - making process because of its essential _",
    "cyclicity _ : for example the perceptual cycle model of neisser @xcite is based on a flow of an entity perceiving external data , cognitively processing that data , making decisions about future actions , and undertaking them thereby depositing new data into the external environment serving as an input into other entities process . in this respect",
    "then , the frustration in the cross - interaction may represent the aim of one group to be ` a step ahead ' of the decision - making of competitors .",
    "inspired by this , the variation of the kuramoto model we propose , for which we solve for fixed points , is close in spirit to the two network models of @xcite which also include frustrations - however we consider finite general networks as opposed to a coupling of two complete graphs .    for a general unweighted undirected network described by an adjacency matrix @xmath0",
    ", the kuramoto model is expressed by the coupled differential equations : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the phase angle for node @xmath3 , @xmath4 is an intrinsic frequency associated with the node , and @xmath5 a coupling constant .",
    "the basic behaviour of this system has been well explored : for sufficiently high coupling , all phases may eventually synchronise and approximately phase lock : @xmath6 ( there are exceptions though , see @xcite ) .    for two - network systems the equations",
    "are doubled and an additional cross network interaction is introduced .",
    "each network represents a distinct population , collection or organisation of entities described by the phase at the node . to distinguish between the two competing populations we shall refer to them ( based on competitive decision making approaches ) respectively as blue and red , and the entities at nodes of the respective networks as agents .",
    "analysing such a model for fixed points , lyapunov stability / instability and chaos allows us to pose questions such as : how should agents be linked to each other ? how quickly should linked agents respond to each other compared to responsiveness to changes in their specific competitor ?",
    "how much diversity in frequency can be afforded by any one population in light of its competitive interactions ? and how can the aim for internal phase synchronisation be balanced against that for frequency synchronisation ( being ahead ) of the competitor .",
    "we show how the model can be unpacked to answer such questions .",
    "while there are analogues of our approach in network control theory with a master network controlling another network , also known as ` outer synchronisation ' @xcite , in our case the two networks stand in a symmetric relationship to each other - each may be seen as seeking to control the other .",
    "a plot of individual @xmath2 as functions of time illustrates our focus . in fig.[phases ] we show blue and red @xmath2 which represent our two types of entities .",
    "different networks connect blue and red internally , with a whole other network for blue to red ; different couplings apply for entities of the same group or between the groups .",
    "the details behind this example are not important .",
    "but we observe that most blue entities are locked slightly ahead of the majority of the red population , while two blue entities are detaching from and then reconnecting with their groups .",
    "when lines diverge they reach @xmath7 difference from each other , namely they rejoin on the other side of the unit circle , and another two red entities completely detach from their group , rejoin , and so on .     as functions of time for the model introduced in this paper",
    "in which there are two populations of phases ` blue ' and ` red ' , where blue entities interact at some coupling strength and on some network while red entities may have a different coupling strength and a different network , and some blue and red entities interact with each other at yet another coupling strength and network .",
    "the splitting of the red lines , with two dropping periodically in relation to the main group of lines , is indicative of fragmentation of the red population.,height=215 ]    it is important to note that our intent is _ not _ to seek prediction of how such network connected entities behave in general for low couplings .",
    "such a regime would undermine control .",
    "we seek , rather , to determine thresholds before ` control ' is lost , so that one population may achieve internal phase synchronisation and external frequency synchronisation with respect to their competitor - such as the main blue population in fig.[phases ] . within this",
    "we seek conditions such that the threshold for the type of fragmenation seen in the low - running red entities in fig.[phases ] may be avoided .",
    "we derive such thresholds from linearisation and classical fixed point conditions .",
    "such thresholds may be seen as bounding a ` strategy ' ( for example , for competitive decision making ) for one population in relation to the other .    in the next section",
    "we detail the model and then analyse its behaviour close to fixed points for the two populations locking internally and then for one population fragmenting into two parts .",
    "we then illustrate our results with numerical examples .",
    "the paper concludes with a summary and future directions of the work .",
    "consider @xmath8 blue agents in an internally connected network given by an adjacency matrix @xmath9 , and @xmath10 red agents connected in a network given by the adjacency matrix @xmath11 , namely matrices with entries one if @xmath3 and @xmath12 are connected by a link and zero otherwise .",
    "associated with each blue agent @xmath13 , is a phase @xmath14 giving the position in a limit cycle ; similarly @xmath15 is the position in the limit cycle of a red agent @xmath16 .",
    "the blue vs red model is given by the system of equations : @xmath17 the matrix @xmath18 is block off - diagonal of dimension @xmath19 representing the network of links of blue to red and _ vice versa_. the non - zero blocks of @xmath20 will be denoted by the @xmath21 and @xmath22 matrices @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively : @xmath25 the quantities @xmath26 represent frequencies of individual blue and red agents respectively ; these may be fixed or drawn from some probability distribution .",
    "the frustration parameters @xmath27 represent the degree to which blue and red , respectively , seek to be ahead of their competitor s limit cycle .",
    "indeed , by representing this interaction as a shifted sine function we are ensuring that blue , respectively red , seek to stay @xmath28 , respectively @xmath29 , ahead of the other but do not continue to accelerate ; in other words there is no advantage to continually lap the adversary , otherwise agents are engaging in increasingly disconnected limit cycles . finally , @xmath30 are coupling constants , respectively , for intra - blue , intra - red , blue to red and red to blue .",
    "asymmetry between blue and red potentially exists both in the coupling constant and the network : @xmath31 need not equal @xmath32 and a network link from blue agent @xmath3 to red agent @xmath12 need not imply a link from red agent @xmath12 to blue agent @xmath3 , so that the cross - network matrix @xmath18 need not be symmetric .",
    "note , however , the overall symmetry between blue and red in eqs.([blue - eq],[red - eq ] ) : neither side can be regarded as a master controller , though each seeks to assert control over the other if the nonlinear dynamics permits . in that respect , as we said at the outset , it is more appropriate to view this not in terms of a controller but of a game between two teams of , respectively , @xmath8 and @xmath10 players . in this sense , the choice of frustration parameters @xmath27 may be referred to as a ` strategy ' : success for agents in these systems means the simultaneous achievement of two activities : synchronising internal limit cycles and staying as close as possible to a fixed phase ahead of the limit cycle of the competitor .",
    "the system eqs.([blue - eq],[red - eq ] ) in general can only be solved numerically . however , since both sides may deem internal phase synchronisation of limit cycles ideal we may explore the regime of a fixed point given by the following conditions : @xmath33 the variables @xmath34 are all time dependent , but @xmath35 are ` small ' fluctuations , and hence we assume @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 . the variables",
    "@xmath39 thus represent the centroid of the blue and red phases respectively @xmath40 the conditions in eq.([fixpoint1 ] ) follow analysis of the pure kuramoto model in @xcite , using the idea of the master stability function for network coupled dynamical systems by @xcite .",
    "the difference between the sides global phases is : @xmath41 we shall soon examine the conditions under which @xmath42 may be constant , but initially - even with blue and red internally phase locking - there may be time dependence within which one or more members of a population loops around the other on the unit circle . thus , as a consequence of any one term in the sums in eq.([bpdef ] ) incrementing by @xmath7 , @xmath42 should be treated as modulo @xmath43 ( from @xmath44 ) or @xmath45 ( from @xmath46 ) .",
    "however , because of the linearisation no fluctuation @xmath47 can develop to represent one or few members of a population breaking off from the whole - we later allow for a separate cluster in the _ ansatz _ - so that @xmath48 is the natural range within this _",
    "ansatz_. we refer to the phase locking within blue , @xmath49 , and red @xmath50 , respectively , as _",
    "local locking _ , and the phase locking of blue with respect to red , @xmath51 , as _ global locking_.",
    "later we shall examine the case of one population fragmenting , but this serves to establish our notation and methods .",
    "we now linearise the system around conditions eqs.([fixpoint1],[fixpoint - alph ] ) using the smallness of @xmath35 at this point , @xmath52 being arbitrary .",
    "we use the following taylor approximations of the interaction terms : @xmath53 inserting eqs.([approx ] ) into eqs.([blue - eq],[red - eq ] ) , the resulting system can be cast in the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 we have adopted the vector notation @xmath57 for @xmath19 dimensional objects across the full blue - red system , while reserving ` hat ' quantities such as @xmath58 for @xmath8 or @xmath10 dimensional vectors relevant to the blue or red networks .",
    "the vectors @xmath59 have @xmath8 , respectively @xmath10 , components all value one .",
    "the quantities @xmath60 and @xmath61 are explained in the following .",
    "the matrices @xmath61 inside the blocks of @xmath62 constitute a _",
    "graph laplacian_. to explain this we introduce some basic notions of graph theory from @xcite using the example of the blue population .",
    "the degree of each blue agent @xmath3 is the number of links from @xmath3 to other blue agents , @xmath63 as an @xmath8 dimensional vector this is written as @xmath64 .",
    "we then introduce a matrix @xmath65 whose only non - zero elements are the degrees @xmath66 running along the diagonal @xmath67 the laplacian for the blue population is then @xmath68 equivalent definitions apply to the red population leading to the graph laplacian for red , @xmath69 .    the matrices @xmath70 are similar to the degree matrix but encode the blue to red links .",
    "for example , we define a degree with which a blue node @xmath3 connects to red agents , @xmath71 which is written as the vector @xmath72 in eq.([fvec ] ) .",
    "the degree matrix can then correspondingly be formed : @xmath73 the same considerations enable definition of @xmath74 .",
    "we would like to decouple the linear system of equations in eq.([linsys ] ) by expanding in some suitable set of eigenvectors . here",
    "the spectral properties of laplacians become a powerful tool , see @xcite . however , as @xmath75 is not generally symmetric , its left and right eigenvectors are not the hermitian conjugates of each other .",
    "the asymmetry in @xmath75 is generated by the cross - network interactions .",
    "for @xmath76 these problems disappear : @xmath77 to orient ourselves through the problem and to set up notation for the interacting situation it is useful to analyse this case carefully . using our knowledge of the spectral properties of graph laplacians , a spanning set of orthonormal eigenvectors for the super - laplacian in the @xmath19 dimensional space is : @xmath78 observe how , consistent with starting our index from zero for the first ( blue population laplacian ) zero mode , we have reserved the index value @xmath79 for the red population laplacian zero mode .",
    "these ( orthonormal ) zero - modes are given through the identification @xmath80 .",
    "we have seen that the vector @xmath81 is given in terms of these zero eigenvectors , thus we expand the fluctuations @xmath57 in the ` normal ' modes : @xmath82 projecting eq.([linsys ] ) from the left on the two zero modes , respectively normal modes , we obtain : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the projection of @xmath85 onto the @xmath86-th eigenvector , @xmath87 represent the mean frequencies within the blue , respectively red , populations and @xmath88 are the eigenvalues .",
    "we may draw two conclusions out of this .",
    "firstly , the condition for the free system to have blue agents lock a fixed phase angle in relation to red agents amounts to @xmath89 , thus @xmath90 this is intuitively sound since our analysis presupposes that blue and red networks have locally locked , and there is no interaction between them so the appearance of global locking is fortuitous .",
    "note that even if both blue and red frequencies are drawn from the same statistical distribution , for finite @xmath91 this condition will not generally be satisfied , in other words @xmath92 , so that one system will run ahead of the other , according to which has greater average frequency , with time dependent @xmath42 global phase difference .",
    "in fact , the equation for @xmath93 can be obtained directly by projection of eq.([linsys ] ) with @xmath94 this is evidently a linear combination of zero modes of @xmath95 so that fluctuations @xmath57 decouple from the dynamics of @xmath42 .",
    "we will see that this no longer applies for the interacting system .",
    "a second conclusion is that the system is absolutely stable due to the positivity of the normal mode spectrum - a consequence of the property of the separate blue and red laplacians - manifesting the absence of cross - network interactions to challenge internal synchronisation .",
    "also , since this analysis is predicated on small fluctuations , @xmath96 must remain small , giving , from eq.([freesys ] ) , @xmath97 with @xmath98 ( eq.([e - val-0 ] ) ) this implies a lower bound on the coupling in terms of the frequency range residing in @xmath99 . as we discuss in @xcite , this is only a weak constraint there being no discrete scale which says how small is sufficient , and its violation does not generate an instability .",
    "however , it does provide a guide to reasonable values of coupling to permit internal synchronisation of agents within the respective populations .",
    "for the interacting system left eigenvectors cease to be the conjugate of right eigenvectors .",
    "this means that the projector for the equation for @xmath100 ceases to annihilate against the super - laplacian @xmath62 and @xmath101 remains in the equation . nevertheless , we persist with the free system basis - accepting that it will not diagonalise @xmath75 . in this case",
    "the dynamical equation for the angle between the centroids of the two populations is @xmath102 we see now that the approximate equation @xmath103 only holds if we suppress the normal mode fluctuations . in this approximation",
    "the solution is : @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 is the total degree between blue and red .",
    "eq.([alphadot - approx ] ) is straightforwardly integrated , with the help of the weierstrass substitution @xmath107 and standard trigonometric formulae , giving the time - dependent solution : @xmath108 where ` const ' is the integration constant given through initial conditions , and @xmath109    if couplings are such that @xmath42 reaches a steady - state value then @xmath110 and @xmath42 is more easily determined from the right hand side of eq.([alphadot - approx ] ) : @xmath111 we observe corrections in eq.([alpha - const - sol ] ) compared to the free - system result eq.([freelock ] ) coming from interactions .",
    "this equation is readily solved for @xmath112 : @xmath113    we highlight a number of properties in eq.([alphasol ] ) .",
    "firstly , there will be complex solutions when @xmath114 .",
    "this coincides with the point in eq.([t - alpha ] ) where the time dependence goes from hyperbolic to trigonometric tangent ( namely , from a plateau to oscillatory behaviour ) .",
    "secondly there may be no solutions when the right hand side of eq.([alphasol ] ) exceeds @xmath115 .",
    "both are indicators that the solution eq.([t - alpha ] ) is varying for all @xmath116 , and therefore that there does not exist a fixed point .",
    "this boundedness of constant solutions @xmath42 , and the dependence of the solution on trigonometric functions of the frustration parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 means that the preferred fixed point of the dynamical system is nonlinear in the parameters defining a population s strategy . stated simply , there may be _ diminishing returns in blue seeking to be too far ahead of red s limit cycle_. we can state this as an optimisation problem .",
    "take the solution to eq.([alphasol ] ) as the function @xmath117 , of the frustration parameters .",
    "this may be regarded as an _ objective function _ determining the optimal strategy for blue or red . _",
    "blue seeks a strategy @xmath28 , given structures , couplings and red s strategy @xmath29 , that maximises @xmath117 .",
    "conversely , red seeks a strategy @xmath29 , given structure , couplings and blue s strategy @xmath28 , that maximises @xmath118 .",
    "_ we show the result of such considerations for a specific numerical example later in the paper .      for the interacting system now we write the eigenvalue - eigenvector problem for the blue population as @xmath119 where @xmath86 labels the @xmath8 independent eigenvectors @xmath58 and discrete eigenvalues @xmath120 .",
    "laplacians so structured enjoy a positive semi - definite spectrum , with the degeneracy of zero eigenvalues , which we label @xmath121 , corresponding to the number of disconnected components the network breaks up into without removing any of the existing links or nodes .",
    "the corresponding un - normalised eigenvector is that with only the values one in its entries : @xmath122 .",
    "we have already encountered these vectors in the definition of @xmath81 .",
    "thus , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 . in the following ,",
    "we consider blue and red networks that each have only one component so that there is only one zero mode for each of @xmath125 .",
    "the lowest non - zero eigenvalue , for example for blue , @xmath126 is known as the algebraic connectivity , @xcite , encoding properties of the extent to which nodes are strongly or weakly linked .",
    "for example , networks with @xmath127 are easily disconnected into separate components with the removal of a small number of blue nodes or links .",
    "the components of the corresponding eigenvector @xmath128 behave like a step function in @xmath3 , with jumps at node values coinciding with the most poorly connected nodes in the network ( those whose removal decouples the network ) , as illustrated in the work by @xcite .",
    "the same statements apply for the red population .    as mentioned , @xmath75 is not symmetric - except when @xmath129 and every blue node that links to a red node in turn is linked to by the same red node .",
    "therefore , even though its matrix elements are real , @xmath75 may have complex eigenvalues .",
    "unfortunately , the gershgorin theorem @xcite only provides bounds on discs within which eigenvalues must lie .",
    "an alternative uses a trick employed in the proof of a lemma by taylor @xcite which identifies positive - definiteness of the super - laplacian @xmath75 : for every @xmath130 that @xmath131 . choosing the free - system eigenvectors @xmath132 , which trivially annihilate under @xmath95 and against the off - diagonal parts of @xmath75",
    ", we obtain from the remaining diagonal elements the two conditions @xmath133 note that for non - symmetric matrices the _ absence _ of positive semi - definiteness is necessary but not sufficient for there to be negative eigenvalues ( for example the matrix @xmath134 is not positive definite as seen using the vector @xmath135 , but has eigenvalue @xmath136 ) .",
    "the same inequality can be obtained from the gershgorin theorem . however ,",
    "when @xmath137 , where the super - laplacian is symmetric , then the above trick gives necessary _ and sufficient _ conditions for positive eigenvalues - whereas the gershgorin theorem still only gives a left most point to an interval which _ contains _ an eigenvalue .",
    "we now consider the case that red may possibly fragment , with those parts of it interacting with blue agents remaining locked with them .",
    "the case of blue fragmenting is entirely symmetric and may be extracted from the following analysis by swapping labels .",
    "we partition red into @xmath138 and @xmath139 with @xmath140 and @xmath141 nodes each , @xmath142 .",
    "we will later choose @xmath138 as those red agents interacting with blue agents , but for completeness the full system of equations after this partition reads : @xmath143 the index @xmath144 labels the parts of @xmath145 .",
    "analogously to our analysis of internal locking , we now impose the fixed point conditions @xmath146 and define the three ` centroid ' phases @xmath147 these may be written in terms of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 using analogues of eq.([bpdef ] ) .    applying these expansions and definitions , the linearised equations eq.([linsys ] )",
    "become @xmath148 dimensional , where the vectors and matrices there are replaced by ` primed ' quantities : @xmath149 @xmath150 and the super - laplacian @xmath151 we recognise in the diagonal elements the laplacians for the disconnected sub - graphs @xmath152 , and additional interaction - dependent contributions : @xmath153 evidently now the free part of the super - laplacian has three zero eigenvectors which are composed of the @xmath154 and @xmath141 dimensional vectors @xmath155 all with entries equal to one .    in the presence of stability ( conditions to be determined below ) with small fluctuations , the dynamical equations for the centroids",
    "@xmath156 lead to : @xmath157 from the definitions of the three centroids given by eq.([3-cent - def ] ) we can see that , @xmath158 since the angles between the centroids are linearly dependent through eq.([13=12 + 23 ] ) , one of the dynamical equations for the angles derived from eq.([3-cent - def ] ) may be eliminated .",
    "choosing @xmath159 , we obtain the equations for the remaining angles between the centroids : @xmath160      to be more specific now , it is natural to expect that with the interaction with blue , the parts of red most likely to fragment in relation to each other are those red agents that are interacting with blue against those that are not .",
    "we choose then @xmath138 to be those interacting with blue , so that @xmath161 .",
    "thus , at steady - state , @xmath162 , the system becomes , @xmath163 where @xmath164 contain the frequencies , and @xmath165 and @xmath166 absorb all the terms multiplying cosines and sines of @xmath28 and @xmath29 : @xmath167 solving for the sine of each of the angles we obtain , @xmath168 where , @xmath169 here , @xmath170 is analogous to @xmath171 for the two centroid _",
    "ansatz_. eqs.([alphabr_1 ] ) and ( [ alphar_1r_2 ] ) determine the centroid phase angles between the three clusters of the steady - state system .",
    "however , like eq.([alphasol ] ) for two clusters , we can see that there are two conditions that will restore the time - dependence .",
    "analogous to the role played by the sign of @xmath171 in eq.([alphasol ] ) , the first condition is when @xmath172 in eqs.([alphabr_1],[alphar_1r_2 ] ) causing the right hand sides of eqs.([alphabr_1],[alphar_1r_2 ] ) to become complex .",
    "the second condition , with no analog in the two cluster case , occurs when the modulus of the right hand side of eq.([alphar_1r_2 ] ) is greater than unity , so that no solution exists for @xmath173 .",
    "because of the many couplings , the threshold for this can not be written in terms of a single critical coupling .",
    "we may determine when the fragmentation _",
    "ansatz _ is preferable over that for the internally locked scenario : if under a parameter variation , solutions to eq.([alphar_1r_2 ] ) exist with @xmath173 reasonably small , then _",
    "ansatz _ eq.([fixpoint1 ] ) may be used over eq.([fixpoint2 ] ) .",
    "looking for the equivalent condition for @xmath174 , means that the square of the right hand side of eq.([alphabr_1 ] ) must be greater than one which , after some algebra , reduces to : @xmath175 which may never hold .",
    "a similar expression also holds for the internal locking scenario in eq.([alphasol ] ) . hence a constant solution for",
    "@xmath174 will exist only if @xmath176 .",
    "even if such a solution exists , there may be no solution for @xmath173 .",
    "bounds on stability are now straightforwardly determined , analogous to eq.([stab-2clust ] ) using taylor s ` lemma ' by contracting with the zero eigenvectors of @xmath177 , leading to the conditions : @xmath178 these three conditions appear to be mutually exclusive until we eliminate one of the phases using eq.([13=12 + 23 ] ) , giving the third condition : @xmath179 as for the internal locking scenario , these conditions give a tighter ( though still not definitive ) bound on conditions for stability of the system than would gershgorin s theorem .",
    "however , the symmetry of the two - dimensional @xmath180 block of the super - laplacian eq.([genlapl ] ) suggests that the second condition of eqs.([stab-3clust ] ) , that on @xmath173 , is tight .",
    "correspondingly , when cross - interactions between blue and @xmath181 are symmetric , and @xmath182 then all of @xmath183 is symmetric and all three conditions become tight bounds on stability .",
    "to measure , on the one hand success in self - synchronisation within a given population , and on the other hand success in one population achieving a certain phase shift with respect to the other , we use local order parameters @xmath184 the first two represent , for blue and red populations respectively , the order parameter introduced by @xcite for self - synchronisation : the closer @xmath185 is to the value one the more that the oscillators achieve phase synchronisation _ within their clusters_. the third , @xmath186 , examines the phase synchronisation within the fragmented red clusters in the case of three overall clusters .",
    "we emphasise that in all of our scenarios in the following the total system order parameter @xmath187 will be far from the value one .",
    "consider two populations of the same total number of agents but where a sub - population of each are cross - interacting with same coupling and one - to - one : @xmath188 but with different internal networks and couplings and frustration parameters .",
    "let the blue population form a hierarchy , naturally described by tree graphs , with a single root , and sets of distinct branches connected to the root , each culminating in leaf nodes .",
    "specifically we use a complete 4-kary tree , thus setting @xmath189 .",
    "we use a random erds - rnyi network for the red population of the same number of agents generated by a link placed between nodes with probability @xmath190 .     in the tree graph with an open circle",
    "interacts with a corresponding number , node @xmath191 ; all other nodes are represented by a filled triangle . , height=264 ]    the two networks are represented in fig.[twonets ] .",
    "we arrange the interaction between blue and red such that each leaf - node of blue ( @xmath192 ) interacts with the correspondingly labelled red node ( @xmath193 ) , shown as open circles in fig.[twonets ] ; of course the random structure of red means there is no consistent pattern in how those red nodes link internally to other red nodes ( there is no hierarchically identifiable ` leadership ' ) . in other words ,",
    "@xmath194 , for agents engaged , respectively not engaged , with a competitor , but @xmath195 .",
    "the spectra of the respective graph laplacians , and the frequencies of each agent , are shown in fig.[spectra ] . a key observation to be made about",
    "the former ( left , fig.[spectra ] ) are the many more low lying eigenvalues for the blue agents network compared to that of red - a consequence of the relative poor connectivity of a tree compared to a random graph .",
    "the frequencies of each agent are drawn from a uniform distribution between zero and one , @xmath196 $ ] . in the examples used here ( right , fig.[spectra ] )",
    ", the average frequencies turn out to be @xmath197 , so that if cross - couplings were set to zero the red population would lap blue over time .",
    "we choose the couplings as follows : @xmath198 as will be seen , these are sufficient to allow blue and red to achieve internal self - synchronisation in the absence of cross - coupling . note that @xmath199 is consistent both with tree networks being harder to synchronise given their relatively poor linking , and with the different profiles of low - lying laplacian ( @xmath200 eigenvalues in fig.[spectra ] .",

    "the average phase difference @xmath42 agrees with the approximation in eq.([t - alpha ] ) and is constant , up to @xmath205 , confirming that blue and red are globally phase locked , with blue only slightly ahead of red .",
    "however at @xmath215 the apparent locking is very temporary - the blue population initially slips behind red ( seen in @xmath42 becoming negative ) , rotates through @xmath7 until once again the system temporarily locks . the same change in behaviour can be seen in the approximate solution for @xmath216 due to @xmath171 becoming negative in the @xmath217 of eq.([t - alpha ] ) though the period disagrees at @xmath215 , a consequence of being very close to the critical point .",

    "there are two lowest solutions to eq.([alpha - const - sol ] ) , both real .",

    "the solution to eq.([alpha - const - sol ] ) is complex : the two solutions are conjugates of each other so that the real parts are identical .",
    "thus in the bottom middle and right plots of the eigenvalue only one point appears - the common real part to the two solutions .",
    "this point corresponds to @xmath224 so it gives the threshold for time - dependence in eq.([specialk ] ) . on the other hand , with @xmath202 and the blue - red interactions symmetric in this example",
    "then the super - laplacian is approximately symmetric .",
    "the two conditions eq.([stab-2clust ] ) approximately give the same condition for a zero eigenvalue which in turn agree with the crossing at zero of the curve in fig.[lambdastudy ] .",
    "thus at this point the zero mode and normal mode dynamics are linked : the onset of dynamics in the leading order solution to @xmath42 coincides with the appearance of a negative eigenvalue of the super - laplacian .    concluding this section we find there is a regime of the full system dynamics in which our linearisation approximation with locking internal to the populations holds showing behaviours consistent with the analytic solutions .",
    "the fixed points may be approximated through eq.([alpha - const - sol ] ) , where the stable one can be identified by the behaviour of the spectrum of @xmath75 . in the context of the blue population seeking a significantly large frustration value , to operate half a cycle ahead of the competitor ( @xmath225 ) ,",

    "the dynamics only permit a small advantage to blue in the small positive solutions @xmath42 consistent with stability , despite the increasing value of @xmath28 . however , beyond the critical point the dynamics yields the advantage to red - albeit temporarily .",
    "the blue population is indeed beyond the point of diminishing return on its strategy .",
    "this point of diminishing return for blue may be analytically computed through eqs.([alpha - const - sol],[alphasol ] ) as part of the optimisation strategy discussed at that stage .",
    "we plot in fig.[optimalph ] the solutions for @xmath117 from the @xmath226 of eq.([alphasol ] ) : the solid line is the negative root and the dashed line the positive root of the quadratic equation eq.([alphasol ] ) .",

    "the mesh is chosen to be finer for values less than or equal to zero . superimposed as dots are the numerical ( black ) and analytical ( grey ) solutions for the angles .",
    "for the right - most plot , there is only a grey dot as numerically the angles @xmath174 and @xmath238 are time - dependent , while eqs.([alphabr_1],[alphar_1r_2 ] ) still give a steady - state solution .",

    "note that we do not plot for the full range @xmath246 - we have verified that over the range given in fig.[kbrevals ] , the @xmath210 eigenvalue is the _",
    "lowest _ and is the _ first _ to cross zero ; outside of the range shown eigenvalues cross and the shape becomes considerably complicated .",
    "we observe firstly that the eigenvalues are consistently positive close to the bounds determined from the first two of eqs.([stab-3clust ] ) ; indeed by inspection from fig.[kbrevals ] , the eigenvalue crosses zero for @xmath247 , exactly in accordance with the second of eqs.([stab-3clust ] ) , consistent with that condition being a tight bound on the spectrum .",
    "we see that up to @xmath241 the numerical solution for the angles @xmath174 and @xmath238 sits on the surface , consistent with there being a positive eigenvalue and thus a stable fixed point .",
    "however , with increasing @xmath31 there is a divergence between the numerical behaviour and analytically determined solutions in the @xmath173 directions - consistent with fig.[kbrstudy ] , and the fact that synchronisation is breaking down within the red population .",
    "finally , at @xmath248 there is no longer steady - state behaviour for @xmath174 and @xmath238 , while eqs.([stab-3clust ] ) still give such a solution .",
    "thus only a grey dot is indicated in the right - most panel of fig.[kbrevals ] .",
    "however this value exactly coincides with a vanishing of the @xmath210 eigenvalue of @xmath183 . as for the internally locked scenario , the point at which a negative eigenvalue appears coincides with the point",
    "at which the angles between centroids of clusters become time - dependent , with eq.([alphar_1r_2 ] ) no longer having a solution .",
    "indeed , as @xmath31 is increased with all else fixed , @xmath170 increases , as seen from eq.([lambda ] ) , so that variations in this way never cross @xmath249 , consistent with the fragmentation _ ansatz _ being the appropriate fixed point choice .",
    "an ` optimal strategy ' for blue in this case is more context dependent . if it is more important that the competitor remain coherent and blue maintain a lead in the cycle , then the bottom two plots of fig.[kbrstudy ] offer a guide . with the conflicting strategies of @xmath250 , the best that blue can hope for is to dynamically match red with @xmath251 at large @xmath31 .",
    "however , beyond @xmath241 there is diminishing return .",
    "this point can still be reasonably estimated analytically up to about @xmath252 . however ,",
    "if complete dislocation of the competitor is desired then @xmath253 is desirable - and this bound too can be estimated from the point where the analytical result eq.([alphar_1r_2 ] ) fails to have a solution .",
    "indeed , since the behaviour in this regime exhibits red agents incoherent with respect to each other _ and _ blue agents tightly locked with their red competitor agents , this is truly a case of blue having its cake and eating it !",
    "we have formulated a mathematical model , based on the two - network frustrated kuramoto model , for two populations , labelled blue and red , on separate networks interacting internally in a cooperative fashion , to self - synchronise individual limit cycles via zero frustration parameters , and externally in a competitive manner with non - zero frustration parameters , with each seeking to be some phase difference in relation to the limit cycle of the other .",
    "we have determined threshold conditions for two types of fixed point behaviour of this combined system , one with both sides achieving their respective internal goals and one or both sides achieve their external goal , and another with one side reaching a threshold for failure to achieve the internal goal . in both cases , we could reduce the criterion for a stable fixed point to a closed form analytical result from which optimal choices of frustration parameters may be computed .",
    "the stability of the fixed point relies on positivity of eigenvalues of a generalisation of the graph laplacian .",
    "we examined some specific cases , comparing full numerical solutions to the analytic solutions , both where our local phase synchronisation assumption is respected for increasing couplings , and where it fails . in both cases ,",
    "the analytic formulae successfully predict the behaviour of the full non - linear system , including the critical point at which blue and red fail to lock with respect to each other or one internally fragments . in the latter cases ,",
    "the agreement is poorer because of the increasing ` splaying ' and ` dislocation ' in the fragmenting population prior to time - dependence kicking in .",
    "again , in both cases we demonstrated how optimisation of the frustration may be computed by determination of thresholds which guarantee avoidance of ` uncontrollable ' chaotic behaviour of parts of the system .",
    "we have shown an example of optimisation in this paper only to illustrate the value of our mathematical approach but have deliberately avoided searching at this stage for nash equilibria .",
    "future work will address the impact of noise and the extension to multiple internal fragmentation and disintegration of clusters .",
    "our hope is in the long term to provide mathematical tools to guide the design of networks to structure against known - or at least statistically parametrisable - competitors .",
