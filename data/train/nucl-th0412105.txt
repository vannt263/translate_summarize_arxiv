    "<S> @xcite , it is merely boosted by a simple factor of 2 while not boosted in the section 2 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , compared with the non - interacting case . in this paper , it will be generally proved that the relation between the effective fermi momentum and density is determined by general principles of thermodynamics . at lower densities , a simple relation among the pion - nucleon sigma term , </S>",

    "<S> @xcite for the two flavor case . ignoring terms breaking flavor symmetry , </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding qcd hamiltonian density can be schematically written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the kinetic term , @xmath18 is the interacting part , and @xmath3 is the average current mass of @xmath19 and @xmath20 quarks . define a new operator @xmath21 with @xmath22 being an equivalent mass to be determined by the requirement that it meets @xmath23 since particles considered are uniformly distributed , or in other words , @xmath13 has nothing to do with space coordinates , one can write @xmath24 this equality is especially obvious if it is considered in terms of quantum mechanics : @xmath25 is a wave function with arguments @xmath13 and coordinates , the expectation value is nothing but an integration with respect to the coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , if @xmath13 does not depend on coordinates , the function @xmath26 is also a coordinate - independent c - number , and can naturally be taken out of the integration . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ mdef ] ) . from this equation </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the equivalent mass @xmath22 includes two parts : one is the original mass or current mass @xmath31 , the other one is the interacting part @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> obviously the equivalent mass is a function of both the quark current mass and the density . at finite temperature </S>",
    "<S> , it depends also on the temperature as well . because the hamiltonian density @xmath28 has the same form as that of a system of free particles with a density dependent mass @xmath22 , the corresponding dispersion relation @xmath33 is also density dependent . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ pfmu ] ) . obviously , the second term is the correspondence of the bag constant @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> the difference is that the bag constant here is not really a constant . instead , it is density - dependent .    </S>",
    "<S> because baryon masses depend on the in - medium chiral condensate , the total energy of the system also depends on it @xcite . in principle , the hadronic matter bellow chiral phase transition point , where the quark condensate is nonzero , should be described in terms of hadronic degree of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , both perturbative and nonperturbative quark interactions , including quark confinement , should be accounted @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so let s expand the equivalent mass to laurent series ( @xmath32 must be divergent at @xmath72 or @xmath73 due to quark confinement ) , and merely take the leading terms in both directions : @xmath74 in the following , it will be seen that the first term is non - perturbative , mainly originated from the linear confinement of quarks , and the second term is from the leading contribution of perturbative interactions with the coefficient @xmath75 connected to the qcd coupling @xmath76 by @xmath77    it is not possible to compare the present formalism at finite density with lattice results . </S>",
