    "elections are an excellent tool with which to study decision - making processes . unlike declarative opinion polls where the obtained data may be affected by different biases ,",
    "elections are an occasion where objective and reliable data about the opinion of a significant number of people are gathered .",
    "if we were to see the opinion dynamics as a natural process , the results of elections would play the role of observed quantities .",
    "traditionally , studies of opinion dynamics in the physics community are posed as a _",
    "direct _ problem .",
    "authors make assumptions on the way people interact with each other and consequently build a model of opinion spreading based on these assumptions  @xcite .",
    "these models successfully describe the qualitative evolution of opinion at a macroscopic level .",
    "more recently , the community has undertaken to study _ inverse _ problems in opinion dynamics .",
    "several authors  @xcite have focused on data in the hope of finding regularities , often called stylized facts , before trying to find the underlying mechanisms leading to them .",
    "for example , it has been found that the distribution of the number of votes received by candidates is a universal scaling function , suggesting that the global opinion forms in a branching process  @xcite .",
    "also , spatial and temporal regularities observed in the results of french elections  @xcite and the strong spatial correlations observed in the turnout rate of elections in many different countries  @xcite , may be interpreted in terms of the existence of a ` cultural field ' whose dynamics obeys a two - dimensional random diffusion equation .",
    "so far , the observed regularities indicate that the processes at stake in opinion formation are similar , irrespective of the social , cultural and economical background of the voters .    in this work we present results regarding two different decision - making processes .",
    "first we consider the participation to local elections ( elections of the mayor or municipal councillors ) . we have gathered and analyzed data from 21 elections in 10 different countries ( see tab .  [ tdata ] ) with different social , economical , and cultural characteristics .",
    "the regularities observed in these data lead us to study the number of representatives to different chambers in different countries ( from local to national level ) .",
    "finally , we propose a phenomenological model which accounts for the empirical regularities and brings a new outlook on the reasons behind abstention in local elections .",
    "by local elections , we mean elections in municipal districts which go from small villages of hundreds of inhabitants to large cities of hundreds of thousand inhabitants .",
    "( details on data analysis are given in the appendix ; data may be downloaded from ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the elections chosen for this study satisfy the following properties : ( 1 ) voting is not compulsory , ( 2 ) there are enough available data so as to ensure good statistics ( typically more than 2000 municipalities ) , ( 3 ) the elections concern only local issues , ( 4 ) the number of registered voters is well known .    for each municipality and each election ,",
    "we denote by @xmath0 the total number of registered voters , @xmath3 the total turnout and @xmath4 the total number of abstentions ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "we define the _ logarithmic turnout rate _ ( ltr ) as @xmath6 , a symmetric and unbounded variable , that highlights statistical regularities appearing over different elections and countries  @xcite .",
    ".local elections analyzed in this paper .",
    "the _ mun _",
    "column indicates the number of municipalities involved in the election ( rounded up or down to the nearest 100 , except for israel ) ; the _ kind _ column indicates whether there is only a single round ( m ) or two , in which case m1 and m2 mean first or the second round respectively .",
    "finally the _ years _ column gives the year of the studied elections for each country . in the particular case of israel ,",
    "( j ) indicates municipalities where the majority of population is jewish and ( a ) those where most of the population is arab . the horizontal line separate elections that show a deviation from the universal behavior ( see text ) . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ si - trepres ]    this power - law dependence can be easily obtained using the following heuristic , which is reminiscent of the _ least difficulty principle _",
    "a good representative democracy must meet two competing requirements .",
    "first , it must maximize the representativeness , that is to say , the number @xmath7 of representatives should be such that the average number of citizens per representative @xmath8 is as small as possible . on the other hand , it must be efficient : in order to make decisions a reasonable number of interactions among the @xmath7 representatives should take place . the higher this number of interactions , the more difficult it is to make a decision . roughly , if one considers all pairwise interactions , the corresponding term is of the order of @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , a ` good ' representative regime is such that the function : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a measure of the relative importance of representativeness and efficiency , is minimum .",
    "this leads immediately to @xmath12 , which is in the range of the observed values .",
    "a short historical investigation of the behavior of the number of representatives with the size of the respective constituencies in old democratic assemblies can be found in the appendix , which in most of the cases do not correspond to the behavior described here .",
    "one reason for this discrepancy could be the fact that those ancient assemblies did not correspond to a democratic regime as we understand it nowadays .",
    "the evolution of the number of representatives of _ one assembly _ with time is possible in the case of the united states , where an important increase of the population ( compared to european democracies ) occurs along with a stable democratic regime .",
    "the results obtained ( see the appendix ) are compatible with the behavior of the @xmath7 described here .",
    "the main idea behind the following phenomenological model is quite simple : when facing a decision , @xmath0 agents behave as if they were grouped into @xmath13 subgroups , with @xmath2 .",
    "this idea is suggested by the observed organization of constituencies into groups , which holds for different scales , and the fact that @xmath14 .",
    "we do not make any assumption about the exact nature or the origin of these groups ; this problem lies beyond the scope of this study .",
    "we just assume that people belonging to a given subgroup share some common traits .",
    "this organization in groups is assumed to go on at all scales , reflecting a hierarchy of differences among agents ( as the subdivisions go on , agents inside the same group are more and more similar one to another ) .",
    "our assumptions relate to the problem of vote participation in local elections in the following way .",
    "let @xmath15 be a random variable characterizing the propensity of one agent to go to vote to a particular election .",
    "@xmath15 is the sum of two independent contributions : the first one , @xmath16 ( i.i.d . with variance @xmath17 ) , characterizes the propensity of people belonging to the same group , and the one , @xmath18 , represents the variability of the individual .",
    "@xmath18 may fluctuate around the average value of the group s propensity , with variance @xmath19 .",
    "hence , an agent @xmath20 who belongs to the group @xmath21 is characterized by a propensity to vote : @xmath22 .",
    "assuming that there are @xmath0 agents distributed in @xmath23 groups of approximatively the same size , the variance of @xmath24 ( representing the total propensity to vote ) is @xmath25 . if @xmath26 the previous equation yields , for @xmath27 and for @xmath17 and @xmath19 of the same order magnitude : @xmath28 , which is the dependency that we observe in data with @xmath2 .",
    "in what follows we will take @xmath29 .",
    "due to the scale invariance of @xmath30 and @xmath31 we assume that @xmath0 individuals form @xmath32 groups ( with @xmath33 ) , of approximately @xmath34 individuals each , and each of these groups subdivide again in approximatively @xmath35 subgroups ( with @xmath36 ) with @xmath37 individuals in each subgroup , and so on as is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fmodel ] .",
    "successive groups form a hierarchical organization , the constituency as a whole at the highest level .",
    "as the number of subgroups at each level fluctuates ( see , for example , at level @xmath38 , the group of @xmath34 individuals subdivides into @xmath39 subgroups but the neighboring group of @xmath40 individuals subdivides into @xmath41 subgroups ) , the length of all the branches ( a branch stops when the group is too small , namely , one single individual ) is not the same .",
    "we note @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the final level of agent @xmath20 , the total distance of an agent with respect to the highest level in the hierarchy , namely , the whole population @xmath0 .",
    "the intention to vote of the agent @xmath20 , @xmath44 , depends on three different components .",
    "first , the idiosyncratic part @xmath45 reflects the intrinsic tendency of agents to vote or not , relative to their cultural , social , etc . , background .",
    "we assume that agents belonging to the same group share the same idiosyncrasy .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the groups at level @xmath46 , issued from the same parent group at level @xmath47 , share some common trait , while having some variability which accounts for the differences emerging at smaller scales .",
    "we thus write for the idiosyncrasy of a group at level @xmath46 , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is random variable of zero mean and whose variance decreases with @xmath47 .",
    "this decrease stands for the fact that differences become smaller at a smaller scale .",
    "the particular decrease law of the variance is irrelevant . here , for simplicity considerations",
    ", we have chosen a variance proportional to @xmath50 .",
    "is proportional to @xmath51 which is @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "] we have tested different decreasing laws for the variance ( proportional to @xmath54 , to @xmath55 or to @xmath56 ) , and we have retrieved the same behavior .",
    "second , we assume that the agent @xmath20 s intention to vote also depends on his or her perceived link to the whole constituency . in other words ,",
    "the intention to vote on a collective issue depends on how strong the feeling of belonging to that collectivity is .",
    "we represent this component by the final number of levels @xmath57 that separates a citizen from the higher level , the whole constituency .",
    "finally , the average intention to vote of the global population is represented by a global field @xmath58 that is a constant over all the municipalities of a country , for each election .",
    "thus , the intention to vote of the agent @xmath20 finally reads @xmath59 and following refs .",
    "@xcite , the decision to vote ( 1 ) or not to vote ( 0 ) is given by @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the heaviside function .",
    ", a group of size @xmath62 includes @xmath63 subgroups of size @xmath64 , i.e. , @xmath65 where @xmath66 represents a small noise .",
    "the group - idiosyncrasy of the agent @xmath20 at its final level , @xmath43 , is simply called @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "for instance , the agent represented by the gray - filled box ( ancestors marked in red ) has the group - idiosyncrasy @xmath69 and a distance @xmath70.,width=302,height=245 ]    the national average of the ltr does not play any role in the observed universal behavior of local elections .",
    "thus , the average ltr depends on the variance of the group - idiosyncratic term @xmath45 and , if the distribution of @xmath57 is not too broad ( as it is the case here ) , on the average total distance of an agent with respect to the original population , @xmath71 .",
    "this distance is determined by the small randomness in the group distribution of each realization , so the only free parameter of the model is the variance of the distribution of idiosyncrasies at a given level .",
    "it can easily be seen that the mathematical expression of the ltr , @xmath72 , obtained from the data , is particularly convenient for idiosyncrasies distributed according to a logistic distribution of zero mean .",
    "let us recall that the probability that an agent , taken at random , will vote is @xmath73 , for large @xmath0 .",
    "then , from the definition @xmath74 , one gets : @xmath75 . on the other hand ,",
    "let @xmath76 , in eq .  (",
    "[ econvic ] ) , be a random variable distributed accordingly to a logistic distribution with zero mean and a scale parameter @xmath77 , and let also , for simplicity , @xmath78 .",
    "then @xmath79 in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "this yields @xmath80 .",
    "for convenience , @xmath81 can also be sampled from a logistic distribution without loss of generality .",
    "then the only free parameter of the model is @xmath77 , the scale parameter of the logistic distribution .",
    "the model agrees with the empirical observations for @xmath82 . indeed , following the chosen form for the decrease with @xmath47 of the variance of @xmath49 , the scale parameter at the level @xmath83 of the distribution of @xmath84 is @xmath85 .",
    "+ we have performed simulations over 200 realizations of the group distribution for a given @xmath0 , each leading to a different realization of the hierarchy depicted in fig .",
    "[ fmodel ] . for each realization and for each group at the level @xmath47 , the size of subgroups at level @xmath86 is such that @xmath87 .",
    "the noise , @xmath66 , is taken from a gaussian distribution with zero mean , and standard deviation equal to @xmath88 .",
    "this small irrelevant noise is introduced in order to avoid steplike curves .",
    "we have calculated , using eq .",
    "( [ econvic ] ) and the voting rule , the corresponding @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the results , shown by the continuous line of fig",
    ".  [ ftau ] , have the same behavior as the observed curves . notice that the model imposes that the simulated @xmath89 behaves as @xmath90 ( with @xmath91 ) but interestingly , the obtained prefactor is very near to the one issued from observed data .",
    "several robustness tests have been performed .",
    "first , we have checked that these results are robust when varying the national field , @xmath58 , in the same range than the @xmath92 obtained from empirical curves ( i.e. , when the turnout rate spreads from @xmath93 up to @xmath94 ) .",
    "second , we have consider the scale parameter @xmath77 and we find that the results are in agreement with the empirical regularities for @xmath95 .",
    "next , instead of directly introducing the noise in each subgroup ( such that @xmath87 ) , we have directly injected the noise in the number of groups in order to account for the dispersion in the exponent observed in data .",
    "more precisely a group with @xmath96 agents at the level @xmath47 is directly split into @xmath97 subgroups .",
    "simulations retrieve empiric regularities when @xmath98 with @xmath99 , and @xmath100 with @xmath101 , which once again is consistent with the assumption @xmath102 .",
    "finally , we have also performed simulations replacing the logistic distribution of the group idiosyncrasy by a gaussian or bimodal distribution , in order to verify that the results are independent from the particular choice of distribution .",
    "we have found that the participation in a decision - making problem , when the @xmath0 agents have to decide about an issue that concerns only themselves as a group , shows a universal population - size effect .",
    "more specifically , we have shown that the average and variance logarithmic turnout rate ( ltr ) decrease in the same way with constituency size , irrespective of local particularities .",
    "this contrasts with the fact that the ltr exhibits no such regularities for national / european elections , when plotted as a function of the population of _ the same set of constituencies_. this difference indicates that agents in each municipality may behave as if their group structure and cohesion becomes important when the object of the election concerns only themselves as a group .",
    "the observed behavior hints at a universal subdivision of the constituencies in @xmath13 subgroups with @xmath2 .",
    "we also find a similar universal behavior for the number of democratic representatives from municipal to national scales , as a function of the size @xmath0 of the constituency that has elected them .",
    "these results agree with the study of the candidature process  @xcite .",
    "a very simple phenomenological model , based on the existence of groups at all scales with the corresponding relation @xmath103 at each scale , quantitatively agrees with the observed behavior of the ltr .",
    "this idea of a hierarchy of group - idiosyncrasies has also been shown in ref .  @xcite .",
    "because in this work we calculate average values of the ltr over many ( typically 100 ) municipalities of similar size , our results do not exclude that other factors might influence the participation rate of a given municipality as has been largely studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this work calls for further interdisciplinary research as the origin of the regularities shown by the data remains unclear .",
    "moreover , as these results seem to be related to the representation that @xmath0 agents have about themselves as a group , one could ask whether they reflect some intrinsic group dynamics that is common to the different situations we analyzed , as has also been observed in anthropological studies  @xcite , or , on the other hand , whether they reflect the way in which the agents ( here humans ) are used to dealing with group classification , as in taxonomic and soil classifications studied in refs .",
    "the latter is suggested by the fact that , if in eq .",
    "( [ eq_repr ] ) we put @xmath104 , the number of agents in one group , @xmath34 , is the geometric mean of @xmath0 and @xmath7 . this can be related to the logarithmic neural representation of numbers as discussed in refs .",

    "these considerations lead sometimes to a lower statistics , e.g. the polish second round takes place in @xmath105 700 and 800 municipalities in the two analyzed elections . finally the case of israel",
    "is shown , despite its poor statistics , because it may help to understand the observed regularities , as discussed in the main text .      * in austria , though the election date may change from one province to another , we have labeled the elections in all the provinces with a single date . * some romanian electors , not registered in the _ lista electorala permanenta _ , are able to vote .",
    "we do not consider those electors . * in one third of the municipalities of the czech republic , the local election takes place on the same day as senate election , and in romania , the municipal election and the election concerning representatives of _ judee _ ( which are a constituted by a group of municipalities , except for large cities , where the corresponding _ jude _ has the same size as the city ) are simultaneous .",

    "<S> studied cases , participation in local elections and the number of democratic representatives at different scales ( from local to national ) , we observe a universal scaling with the constituency size . </S>",
    "<S> these results may be interpreted as constituencies having a hierarchical structure , where each group of @xmath0 agents , at each level of the hierarchy , is divided in about @xmath1 subgroups with @xmath2 . following this interpretation </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a phenomenological model of vote participation where abstention is related to the perceived link of an agent to the rest of the constituency and which reproduces quantitatively the observed data . </S>"
