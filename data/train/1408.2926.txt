    "the quest for dark matter ( dm ) is one of the most intriguing aspects of current research frontiers of particle physics , astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "cosmological observations have provided compelling evidence for the existence of dm .",
    "the most recent cosmological results based on _ planck",
    "_ measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature and lensing - potential power spectra indicate that dm comprises about @xmath3 of the energy density of the universe which also contains about @xmath4 baryon matter and about @xmath5 dark energy  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the dm nature and its interactions with the standard model particles remain unknown .",
    "many theories beyond the standard model of particle physics predict natural candidates for dm . among them , motivated by the fact that the dm and baryon densities in the universe are of the same order of magnitude , asymmetric dark matter ( adm )  @xcite has been proposed as one of the most promising classes of candidates for dm .",
    "having inherited a similar matter - antimatter asymmetry as baryons , the models of adm mainly focus on the dm mass region around a few gev . in this mass region , these models are favored by an excess of events over the expected background observed in some underground dm direct detection experiments such as cogent  @xcite , dama  @xcite and cresstii  @xcite as well as the recent results presented by the cdms - ii(si ) collaboration  @xcite .",
    "however , these observational evidences are in strong tension with the constraints set by some other experimental groups like xenon100  @xcite , lux  @xcite and supercdms(ge )  @xcite .",
    "isospin - violating dark matter ( ivdm ) provides a possible mechanism to reconcile the tension among different experiments  @xcite . within the ivdm framework",
    ", dm is assumed to couple differently with protons and neutrons , and this assumption of the isospin violation has been supported by a number of theoretical works  @xcite based on the particle physics point of view . especially , ivdm can also be asymmetric in the model proposed by okada and seto in ref .",
    "@xcite .    besides the underground dm direct detection experiments in terrestrial laboratory ,",
    "the existence of old neutron stars in our galaxy can also provide constraints on the scattering cross - sections between dm and nucleons .",
    "this subject was firstly studied by goldman and nussinov  @xcite , and then a lot of works have been done during the last few years  @xcite . especially for adm , due to the asymmetry between particles and anti - particles in the dm sector ,",
    "dm annihilation is not significant in this case .",
    "therefore , dm can continually accumulate in the neutron star without depleting . after being thermalized through continually scattering with the neutron star matter",
    ", these dm particles will gather within a small thermal radius at the central region of the neutron star , then become self - gravitating and eventually collapse into black holes which could destroy the host neutron star .    for non - interacting fermionic dm , due to the fermi degeneracy pressure , the required number for the self - gravitating dm to collapse into black holes ( i.e. , the chandrasekhar limit ) is about @xmath6  @xcite , where @xmath7 is the planck mass and @xmath8 is the dm mass . except for dm with a huge @xmath8 ,",
    "this number is far beyond the amount of dm particles that could be captured by a neutron star within a few billion years inside a dm halo with density similar to that around the earth . on the other hand , for non - interacting bosonic",
    "dm the degeneracy pressure does not exist , and the relevant chandrasekhar limit for collapsing becomes much smaller , i.e. , about @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "this dm amount can be easily accumulated within the living age of a typical old neutron star if the dm - nucleon scattering cross - section is not too small .",
    "furthermore , for the bosonic dm , the possible existence of the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) inside the neutron star could further facilitate the onset of self - gravitation , leading to an enhancement effect on the gravitational collapse .",
    "once the mini black hole is formed inside the neutron star , it could subsequently lead to the ultimate destruction of the neutron star if it consumes the neutron star matter faster than the hawking evaporation",
    ". however , old nearby neutron stars have been well observed , and this thus could result in a very severe constraint on the scattering cross - sections of the non - interacting bosonic adm with nucleons .",
    "the above arguments are based on the assumption that the dm particles have no self - interactions ( except for gravity ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that for fermionic dm , the required dm particle number for gravitational collapse can be strongly reduced if an attractive yukawa force can appear among dm particles  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the repulsive self - interactions as well as the effect of dm - nucleon coannihilations can also prevent the black hole formation for bosonic dm  @xcite .    in previous studies ,",
    "the neutron stars have been generally assumed to be consisted of pure neutrons with constant density throughout a sphere .",
    "however , for a realistic neutron star , its composition is much more complicated than a simple uniform neutron sphere  @xcite .",
    "that is , not only neutrons but also protons , leptons and even some non - nucleonic degrees of freedom may appear inside the neutron star .",
    "furthermore , the density profiles for various constituents in the neutron star are far beyond uniformly distributed .",
    "these variations could become even more important and interesting when we deal with ivdm which interacts with various components differently .",
    "for example , in the extreme case that dm only couples to protons ( as for anapole interactions  @xcite ) , constraints on dm - nucleon cross sections set by neutron stars would become much weaker ( but non - zero ) due to the fact that the proton fraction is usually much smaller than the neutron fraction inside a typical neutron star .",
    "the motivation of the present work is twofold .",
    "firstly , we investigate how the isospin violating dm - nucleon interactions and the symmetry energy in the equation of state ( eos ) of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter affect the extraction of the bound on the dm - proton scattering cross - section @xmath0 from the existence of old neutron stars , by considering , for the first time , a more realistic neutron star model in which the neutron star is assumed to be static and composed of @xmath10-stable and electrically neutral @xmath11 matter ( i.e. , the so - called conventional neutron stars ) and its structure is obtained by solving the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations .",
    "secondly , we extract the bound on the dm - proton scattering cross - section @xmath0 from the existence of a realistic isolated pulsar , i.e. , the observed nearby old neutron star psr b1257 + 12 , and compare the results with those from direct detection experiments , especially for ivdm .",
    "we restrict our attention on the non - interacting bosonic asymmetric ivdm within the gev mass region which is favored by recent dm direct detection experiments .",
    "our results indicate that both the isospin violating dm - nucleon interactions and the symmetry energy can significantly affect the extraction of the bound on the dm proton scattering cross - section @xmath0 from the existence of old neutron stars . in particular , the observed nearby isolated old neutron star psr b1257 + 12 can set a stringent limit for low - mass dm particles that reaches a sensitivity beyond the current best limits from direct detection experiments and excludes the dm interpretation of all previously - reported positive experimental results , including the ivdm .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we describe the main models and methods used in the present work , including a brief introduction to the symmetry energy and neutron star structure , how to calculate the capture rates of the dm particles onto a structured neutron star and how to determine the conditions for the black hole formation inside neutron stars . in sec .",

    "the symmetry energy essentially characterizes the isospin dependent part of the eos of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter and it is defined via the parabolic approximation to the nucleon specific energy ( i.e. , eos ) of an asymmetric nuclear matter , i.e. , @xmath12 with baryon density @xmath13 and isospin asymmetry @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the proton and neutron densities , respectively .",

    "<S> isospin - violating dark matter ( ivdm ) , which couples differently with protons and neutrons , provides a promising mechanism to ameliorate the tension among recent direct detection experiments . </S>",
    "<S> assuming dm is non - interacting bosonic asymmetric ivdm , we investigate how the existence of old neutron stars limits the dm - proton scattering cross - section @xmath0 , especially the effects of the isospin violating dm - nucleon interactions and the symmetry energy in the equation of state of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations are completely based on general relativity and especially the structure of neutron stars is obtained by solving the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations with nuclear matter equation of state constrained by terrestrial experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , by considering the more realistic neutron star model rather than a simple uniform neutron sphere as usual , the @xmath0 bounds from old neutron stars can be varied by more than an order of magnitude depending on the specific values of the dm neutron - to - proton coupling ratio @xmath1 , and they can be further varied by more than a factor of two depending on the density dependence of the symmetry energy . in particular , we demonstrate that the observed nearby isolated old neutron star psr b1257 + 12 can set a very strong limit on @xmath0 for low - mass dm particles ( @xmath2 ) that reaches a sensitivity beyond the current best limits from direct detection experiments and disfavors the dm interpretation of previously - reported positive experimental results , including the ivdm . </S>"
