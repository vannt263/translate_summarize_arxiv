    "statistical models that include random effects are commonly used to analyze longitudinal and clustered data . when generalized linear mixed models ( mcculloch , searle and neuhaus , @xcite ) and maximum likelihood estimation are used to analyze such data , strong , parametric assumptions about the random effects distribution are typically made .",
    "are inferences sensitive to this specification ?    one body of research has indicated that the impact of misspecification of the _ shape _ of the random effects distribution is slight , especially for estimating regression parameters other than the intercept ( e.g. , neuhaus , hauck and kalbfleisch , @xcite ; neuhaus , kalbfleisch and hauck , @xcite ; butler and louis , @xcite ; heagerty and kurland , @xcite ) .    however , a number of authors have claimed sensitivity to parametric specification of a random effects distribution .",
    "an oft - quoted article is that of heckman and singer ( @xcite ) , which ( in describing performance of maximum likelihood estimation ) states , `` both theoretical and empirical examples indicate that estimates of structural parameters obtainedfrom conventional procedures are very sensitive to the choice of mixing distributions . ''",
    "other authors have suggested more flexible distributional assumptions for the random effects to protect against misspecification .",
    "approaches include nonparametric maximum likelihood ( aitkin , @xcite ; agresti , caffo and ohman - strickland , @xcite ) , more flexible parametric distributions ( zhang et  al . , @xcite ) , marginalized mixed effects models ( heagerty and zeger , @xcite ) , h - likelihood approaches that can be easily adapted to fit different distributions ( lee and nelder , @xcite ) , families of parametric distributions ( piepho and mcculloch , @xcite ) , mixtures of normal distributions ( lesaffre and molenberghs , @xcite ) and `` smooth '' nonparametric fits ( zhang and davidian , @xcite ) .",
    "a recent article ( huang , @xcite ) encapsulates the sentiment used to justify these approaches :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ for computational convenience , random effects in glmms are almost routinely assumed to be normal .",
    "however , the normality assumption may be unrealistic in some applications .",
    " early investigation to address this concern suggested that misspecifying the models for the random effects usually only results in a small amount of bias in the maximum likelihood estimators ( mles ) for the fixed effects ( neuhaus , hauck and kalbfleisch , @xcite ) .",
    "however , more recently , many authors have found that likelihood - based inference can be severely affected if the random - effect model is misspecified .",
    "for example , heagerty and kurland ( @xcite ) computed the asymptotic bias in the mles for the parameters in  a  logistic mixed model in four instances of  random - effect model misspecification .",
    "they concluded that incorrect assumptions on the random effects can lead to bias in the mles for the fixed effects .",
    "agresti , caffo and ohman - strickland ( @xcite ) conducted empirical studies on the impact of model misspecification for the random effects in glmms , showing that the mles for the fixed effects can be very sensitive to the assumed random effect model . finally , litire , alonso and molenberghs litire , alonso and molenberghs ( @xcite ) used simulation to show that the type i and type ii errors of tests for the mean structure in a logistic mixed model can be seriously affected by violations of the random - effect model . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    a body of work with a slightly different focus has been that of estimating the shape of the random effects distribution , also by hypothesizing more flexible distributional fits for the random effects . though this is different from assessing misspecification , it is a closely related problem and those methods may help diagnose misspecification in the situations in which sensitivity to misspecification is of concern .",
    "approaches to this problem have used mixtures of normal distributions ( magder and zeger , @xcite ; caffo , an and rohde , @xcite ) , and nonparametric and `` smooth '' nonparametric fits ( laird , @xcite ; davidian and gallant , @xcite ; zhang and davidian , @xcite ; ghidey , lesaffre and eilers , @xcite ) . see ghidey , lesaffre and verbeke ( @xcite ) for a recent review article in the context of linear mixed models .",
    "we use data from the heart and estrogen replacement study ( hers ) ( hulley et  al . , @xcite ) to illustrate some of our findings .",
    "hers was a randomized , blinded , placebo controlled trial for women with previous coronary disease .",
    "the study enrolled 2,763 women and followed them annually for five subsequent visits , generating longitudinal data .",
    "more detail is given in section [ sechers ] , but we foreshadow the results here .",
    "we fit logistic regression models with random intercepts to model whether or not a woman had high blood pressure as a function of her body mass index , whether she was on hypertensive medication , and a trend over the visits .",
    "for the random intercepts the models assumed one of four distributions : normal , a centered and scaled exponential distribution , a @xmath0 distribution or a 3 point discrete distribution , quite different parametric assumptions .",
    "the regression parameters were very similar , despite evidence for differences in overall model fit .",
    "how can we reconcile this with the claims above ?",
    "we will argue that concerns over the parametric specification of random effects distributions are sometimes valid , but ofttimes misplaced .",
    "this is due to three reasons : ( 1 ) sensitivities are restricted to aspects of the estimation that are not typically of interest , ( 2 ) the situations considered are unfairly extreme , or ( 3 ) that close scrutiny of published results does not actually support sensitivity to misspecification .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we outline a series of examples and their associated inferences .",
    "we then describe the basic statistical model .",
    "the sections that follow look at the impact of misspecification on various aspects of the model .",
    "the remaining sections consider some simulation studies , the hers example ( in more detail ) , some remarks on more complicated random effects structures , and we conclude with a brief summary .",
    "a key argument we make is that the robustness is dependent on the inferential setting .",
    "perhaps the most common inference for which a regression model is used is estimation and testing of regression coefficients associated with a covariate . in the clustered data setting , a useful distinction is whether a covariate is a  `` between - cluster '' covariate , meaning that it is constant over the units in a cluster or a `` within - cluster '' covariate , meaning that it varies withina  cluster , but has an average that is constant between clusters .",
    "for example , in a longitudinal study with participants being clusters and all participants contributing data across 4 time points , the ethnicity of the subject would be a between - cluster covariate and the visit number would be a  within - cluster covariate .",
    "of course , covariates are often neither purely between or within , for example , the body mass index of a participant measured over time , in which case it is often useful for pedagological , substantive or technical reasons to decompose a  covariate into its purely - between and purely - within components ( neuhaus and kalbfleisch , @xcite ; raudenbush and bryk , @xcite ; neuhaus and mcculloch , @xcite ) .",
    "other inferential goals include using the fitted model to generate predictions , generating predicted values of the random components of the model , or estimating aspects of the distribution of the random components of the model , for example , as in a variance components analysis ( searle , casella and mcculloch , @xcite ) .",
    "to illustrate these distinctions , we begin with a  series of examples .",
    "metlay et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) evaluated the effectiveness of an educational program that attempted to reduce the inappropriate use of antibiotics for conditions nonresponsive to antibiotics .",
    "the study was a cluster randomized trial , randomized at the level of the hospital , with 8 intervention and 8 control hospitals .",
    "measurements were taken at each hospital in the year before and after the interventions were introduced .",
    "the data were further clustered by physician within hospital .",
    "the primary inference involved a comparison of responses before and after the intervention , a within - cluster ( @xmath1hospital ) covariate setting .      in the previous example , 8 of the hospitals were veteran s administration ( va ) hospitals and 8 were non - va .",
    "a secondary goal was to compare the rates of inappropriate usage between va and non - va hospitals , a between - cluster covariate setting .",
    "auble et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) studied the performance of four clinical prediction rules for estimating the risk of death or serious complications for patients admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of heart failure .",
    "the goal was to develop a rule that could stratify patients into low and high risk groups .",
    "one of the models used was a  random effects logistic regression model accommodating clustering of outcomes by hospital .",
    "the inferential goal was to develop a prediction rule based on the fixed effects in the model .",
    "zhang et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) wanted to estimate subject - specific rates of disease progression in chronic kidney disease patients .",
    "they estimated subject - specific slopes of the change in glomerular filtration rate ( a measure of kidney function ) over time .",
    "they used a linear mixed model with clustering by subject and non - normally distributed random effects .",
    "the inferential goal was to predict the realized values of the random effects .",
    "selby et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) studied the variation in the rates of coronary angiography ( a diagnostic procedure using x - rays and a  special dye to diagnose coronary artery disease ) across 16 hospitals .",
    "significant variation after adjusting for differences in patient populations indicates over- or under - use of the procedure , leading to poor patient outcomes and/or wasted resources .",
    "the inferential goal was to estimate the variance of the hospital random effects after adjusting for patient characteristics .",
    "each of the above examples describes clustered or longitudinal studies , in which repeated observations of the outcome are taken within clusters , for example , multiple measurements of kidney function on a  patient .",
    "these are the types of scenarios we consider .",
    "an immediate distinction to make is the different scenario considered by heckman and singer ( @xcite ) , in which there is only a single observation of the outcome per cluster ( in their case , a time - to - event outcome ) . in the normal linear mixed model",
    "setting , with only a single observation per cluster , the random effect and error term are completely confounded , leading to lack of identifiability .",
    "the presence of identifiability in the heckman and singer situation arises only through strong parametric assumptions , so it is not surprising that results are sensitive to the choice of distribution .",
    "such settings do not represent longitudinal or clustered studies and we do not consider them further .",
    "the model we will use to assess the impact of misspecification is a generalized linear mixed model for clustered data with random intercepts , @xmath2 .",
    "there are fewer results for more complicated covariance structures , such as those generated by random intercept and slope models , which we discuss briefly in section [ secrslopes ] .",
    "let @xmath3 represent the @xmath4th observation @xmath5 within cluster @xmath6 @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that , conditional on the random effects , the  @xmath3 are independent : @xmath8 ) & = & b_i + \\mathbf{x}'_{it}\\bolds { \\beta},\\\\ b_i & \\sim & \\mbox { i.i.d . }",
    "f_b , \\nonumber\\\\ \\mbox{e}[b_i ] & = & 0 \\quad\\mbox{and}\\quad \\operatorname{var}(b_i ) = \\sigma ^2_b\\nonumber,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is a known link function , @xmath10 is the parameter vector for the fixed effects , and @xmath11 is a vector of covariates for cluster @xmath6 at time @xmath4 .",
    "we consider the performance of maximum likelihood for estimating the parameters .",
    "we focus especially on the situation where the assumed distribution is normal , since this is the most commonly implemented choice in popular software packages such as sas , stata and r.    the model , ( [ glmm ] ) , contains a number of specifications . the main specification we will consider is the _ shape _ of the random effects distribution ,",
    "that is , the parametric form of the distribution , @xmath12 may be incorrectly specified .",
    "we have briefer comments on two other aspects of the specification .",
    "we may be concerned that :    * basic characteristics of the random effects distribution may depend on a covariate .",
    "for example , the mean or variance of @xmath13 depends on a covariate .",
    "* there is a dependence of the random effects distribution on cluster sample size .",
    "for example , the mean of @xmath13 depends on @xmath14 .",
    "when the mean of the random effects distribution depends on a covariate , a fundamental relationship is introduced between the covariate and the distribution , potentially creating a serious bias in estimating the form of the relationship between the covariate and the outcome .",
    "neuhaus and mcculloch ( @xcite ) discuss reasons for this , suggest decomposing covariates of interest into within- and between - cluster components and investigate conditions under which this decomposition can remove or reduce bias .",
    "heagerty and kurland ( @xcite ) study situations where the variance of the random effects distribution depends on a covariate and consider use of conditionally specified models ( as we do here ) , as well as models that specify a marginal regression equation ( e.g. , logistic regression for binary outcomes ) but incorporate random effects in an underlying conditional model .",
    "they show that , for estimating the conditionally specified parameters of ( [ glmm ] ) , the impact of highly unequal variances can lead to substantial bias .",
    "so both of these aspects of the specification of  ( [ glmm ] ) are potentially important .",
    "some authors have argued ( hoffman , sen andweinberg , @xcite ; williamson , datta and satten , @xcite ) that when the cluster sample size is incorrectly assumed to be independent of the random effects distribution , serious consequences may result .",
    "neuhaus and mcculloch ( @xcite ) argue that this type of misspecification is really a variation of incorrect assumptions about the mixing distribution .",
    "if one assumes that the parameters in the joint distribution of @xmath14 and @xmath15 are not functionally related to the parameters of interest , namely , those in the distribution of outcomes or random effects , then as a  function of @xmath16 , neuhaus and mcculloch ( @xcite ) show that @xmath17    this is a useful representation of the joint likelihood of @xmath18 and @xmath19 since analysts would typically model the distribution of the responses conditional on covariates and sample size . in particular , ignoring the association of cluster size with response",
    ", one would base inference on the incorrect likelihood built up of terms @xmath20 where the asterisks denote assumed distributions .    comparing equation ( [ eqfalseglmm ] ) , the assumed likelihood and ( [ eqtruecondit1 ] ) , the true likelihood",
    ", we see that we can view  ( [ eqfalseglmm ] ) as arising from ( [ eqtruecondit1 ] ) but with a misspecified random effects distribution , namely , the conditional distribution of @xmath21 given @xmath14 and @xmath22 is incorrectly specified as @xmath23 .",
    "this is important because some of the comments we make below for random intercepts models concerning misspecification of the _ shape _ of the random effects distribution will also apply to incorrectly assuming that the cluster sample size is independent of the random intercept distribution .",
    "situations in which the informative cluster size is related to the random slopes are more involved .",
    "we next consider in more detail the impact of shape misspecification of the random effects distribution , organized by the inferential targets .",
    "virtually every study of the impacts of misspecification has shown little impact on within - cluster  covariates .",
    "neuhaus , hauck and kalbfleisch ( @xcite ) , neuhaus , kalbfleisch and hauck ( @xcite ) and heagerty and kurland ( @xcite ) developed analytic results to assess the impact of misspecification of the random effects distribution using the theory of inference under misspecified models ( huber , @xcite ; akaike , @xcite ; white , @xcite ) .",
    "this theory shows that estimators obtained by maximizing the likelihood based on a misspecified random effects distribution converge to values that minimize the kullback  leibler divergence ( kullback , @xcite ) between the correctly specified and misspecified models . in cases such as",
    "the linear mixed effects model and binary matched pairs ( neuhaus , kalbfleisch and hauck , @xcite ) , one can obtain closed form solutions for the values that minimize the kullback ",
    "leibler divergence . in these cases",
    ", the closed form solution shows that the estimator based on  misspecified random intercepts is identical to the standard conditional likelihood estimator , an estimator unaffected by the random effects distribution .",
    "in other cases , one can show consistent estimation at @xmath24 for generalized linear mixed models with misspecified random intercept distributions .",
    "for example , neuhaus , hauck and kalbfleisch ( @xcite ) show consistent estimation at @xmath24 for logistic models with misspecified random intercept distributions and neuhaus and mcculloch ( @xcite ) extend the result to the entire class of generalized linear mixed models .",
    "in addition , one can obtain approximate solutions to kullback  leibler divergence minimizers using taylor expansions ( neuhaus , hauck and kalbfleisch,@xcite ) . using this device , neuhaus , hauck and kalbfleisch ( @xcite )",
    "show little asymptotic bias in a logistic model with misspecified random intercepts .",
    "heagerty and kurland ( @xcite ) , in their table 1 , show  virtually no impact on the asymptotic bias in logistic regression models with a wide variety of gamma - distributed random effects .",
    "chen , zhang and davidian ( @xcite ) , in investigating bias and efficiency in logistic models , state that :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ estimation of @xmath25 , which corresponds to a  covariate changing within individuals , suffers no loss of efficiency under misspecification of the random effects distribution .",
    "similar results have been reported by tao et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) and zhang and davidian ( @xcite ) . ",

    "but , if we compare the standard deviations under the two true distributions ( 1  under normality and 2.1 under @xmath28 ) , we might be tempted to incorrectly conclude that misspecification causes a  large decrease in efficiency . in neuhaus , mcculloch and boylan ( @xcite ) , we therefore considered the same scenario as investigated in litire , alonso and molenberghs ( @xcite ) , but we varied the assumed distribution .",
    "contrary to their conclusions , our results showed that misspecification had virtually no impact on power , except a very modest impact for the combination of small sample sizes with huge random effects variances ( variances of 16 or 32 on the logit scale ) .",

''",
    "these suggest a general failure of generalized estimating equation approaches .",
    "however , careful examination of their results shows that the poor performance is mainly isolated to the intercept terms .",
    "the simulation reported in table  3 of hoffman , sen and weinberg ( @xcite ) does not demonstrate bias for @xmath30 , the covariate effect , and simulations reported in williamson , datta and satten ( @xcite ) show bias on the order of @xmath29 ( their table 1 ) for covariate effects .",

    "they give a theoretical argument as to why bias is to be expected in the intercept but not other regression parameters",
    ".    in summary , misspecification of the shape of the random effects distribution can introduce a moderate to large bias in estimation of the intercept .",
    "this will carry over to possible bias in estimation of the mean value of the outcome for fixed covariate values .",
    "so , when inference focuses on mean estimation or the intercept , care should be taken with the specification of the random effects distribution .",
    "much less work exists on the effect of misspecification on prediction of the random effects .",
    "magder and zeger ( @xcite ) demonstrated robustness of predictions as gauged by mean square error of prediction in linear mixed models and conclude , `` differences in the performances of the various methods in estimation of the random effects , @xmath21 , were generally not very large . '' in simulating the performance of the posterior mean estimates in logistic models , agresti , caffo and ohman - strickland ( @xcite ) did not find a change in performance when the true distribution was varied between uniform , exponential and normal and the assumed distribution was normal .",
    "however , as noted above , this does not directly address the question of misspecification .",
    "they did find a number of situations in which assuming a  normal distribution suffered a moderate loss of performance when the true distribution was a discrete two - point distribution .",
    "zhang et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) ( their table  2 ) showed only modest differences in the mean square error of prediction of random slopes and intercepts when assuming normality and under a true log gamma distribution for a linear mixed model .",
    "mcculloch and neuhaus ( @xcite ) investigated both linear mixed models and logistic mixed models under a variety of assumed and true distributions , both by theory and simulation , and found only modest impacts to misspecification on the mean square error of prediction , using posterior mean predictions for the linear mixed models and posterior mode predictions for the logistic mixed models .",
    "exceptions were when a distribution with limited support was assumed , but the true distribution had a wider range of support and for large random effects variances and large cluster sizes .",
    "the _ shape _ of the distribution of the best predicted values is a different matter .",
    "a number of authors ( lesaffre and molenberghs , @xcite ; magder and zeger , @xcite ; zhang and davidian , @xcite ) have demonstrated convincingly it may not reflect the true underlying shape of the distribution of the @xmath2 , but instead the assumed distribution .",
    "we also demonstrate this in our example .",
    "so , although the _ performance _ of the best predicted values ( as gauged by the mean square error of prediction ) is robust , shapes of distributions of best predicted values are not .    to recap , the shape of the distribution of the best predicted values is highly sensitive to the assumed form of the distribution .",
    "this is unfortunate because it means that diagnostics based on the empirical distribution of the best predicted values ( e.g. , histograms or q  q plots ) are unreliable .",
    "however , the performance of either posterior mean or posterior mode predicted values ( as judged by overall mean square error of prediction ) are generally robust across a wide variety of assumed distributions .",
    "some loss of efficiency was evidenced with large cluster sizes and large random effects variances , in which definition of the correct random effects distribution is clearer .",
    "again , with regard to estimation of the random effects variance , there is less research .",
    "neuhaus , hauck and kalbfleisch ( @xcite ) and heagerty and kurland ( @xcite ) demonstrated little effect on estimation of the random effects variance , with asymptotic relative bias on the order of 15% or less .",
    "agresti , caffo and ohman - strickland ( @xcite ) demonstrated some situations , mostly with larger random effects variances and large cluster sizes , when there was efficiency loss with assuming a normal distribution , when the true distribution was a discrete , two - point distribution .",
    "neuhaus and mcculloch ( @xcite ) show via simulation in the informative cluster size case that bias is slight .",
    "as noted , this aspect of misspecification has not received the scrutiny that the other aspects above have , perhaps because inference centering on the random effects variance is somewhat less common . as a result ,",
    "the literature is far from definitive .",
    "nevertheless , the basic picture is similar to that of covariate effects : estimates of the random effects variance appears relatively robust to misspecification of the random intercept distributional shape .",
    "we have mainly considered the situation in which only a single aspect of the model , the shape of the random intercepts distribution , has been misspecified . in practice , of course , all assumptions are violated to at least a minor degree .",
    "what is the impact of simultaneous misspecification of more than one aspect ? there is little in the literature to report , but previous work does inform on two aspects . first , neuhaus and mcculloch ( @xcite ) show that use of conditional likelihood methods and methods that separate covariates into between and within components eliminate or reduce bias for the within - cluster covariate in the situation where the random effects are associated with the covariates .",
    "the argument works by showing that estimation of the within - cluster covariate is essentially divorced from the random effects distribution when using these methods , also making it impervious to shape misspecification .",
    "second , the arguments of neuhaus and mcculloch ( @xcite ) , showing that informative cluster sizes have little impact on the bias of regression coefficients , proceed by converting the informative cluster size problem into the misspecified random effects distribution as displayed in ( [ eqtruecondit1 ] ) . this same argument can be used to show that , even with simultaneous misspecification of the shape of the random effects distribution and informative cluster sizes , maximum likelihood estimators of the regression coefficients ( other than the intercept ) will be consistent in a  linear mixed model and , for @xmath24 , consistent at zero for generalized linear mixed models . while not all - encompassing ,",
    "this result for generalized linear mixed models is important for testing the null hypothesis that @xmath24 .",
    "we performed a simulation study to evaluate the performance of each of the above aspects of inference .",
    "the goal was to gauge the performance of assumed normal fits to a distribution that was highly non - normal , but not as extreme as a two - point , discrete distribution .",
    "we chose a @xmath0 distribution , since , depending on the values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 the tukey distribution can be quite skewed and/or heavy - tailed .",
    "see he and raghunathan ( @xcite ) for a recent reference .",
    "we chose @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which gives a mean of 0.31 , variance of 2.27 , skewness of 3.41 and a kurtosis of 44.24 .",
    "the simulations used two covariates : one within - cluster and one between - cluster covariate . the within - cluster covariate was equally spaced between 0 and  1 .",
    "the between - cluster covariate was binary with a  25%/75% division .",
    "the parameter values were : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "we set the number of clusters , @xmath40 to 200 and used a variety of cluster sizes ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) .",
    "we simulated data under a  logistic link and the @xmath0 distribution .",
    "we ran 1,000 replications for each scenario and used common random numbers across different cluster sizes and fitted distributions to increase precision of comparisons .",
    "we conducted simulations in sas ( ver  9.1 , sas institute , cary nc ) and fit models using proc nlmixed .",
    "to each simulated data set we fit three glmms with a logistic link .",
    "the first model assumed that the random effects were standard normal and the second assumed they followed a standardized @xmath0 distribution with unknown @xmath32 and @xmath43 especially with small cluster sizes , there is little or no information about the shape parameters of the tukey distribution and trying to estimate those parameters led to unstable estimation . to directly assess the effect of misspecification and to avoid confounding the effects of an incorrect distributional shape with the estimation of the two additional parameters ,",
    "we fit a third glmm with the random effects following a tukey distribution with @xmath32 and @xmath44 fixed at their true values of 0.5 and 0.1 , but still estimating the random effects variance .",
    "figure [ figbias ] gives the results for the bias of the estimators .",
    "as expected , there was virtually no impact of using an assumed normal distribution in the estimation of the within - cluster covariate .",
    "there was a  modest impact in estimating the between covariate and the intercept ( but with bias less than @xmath29 for the between - cluster covariate and less than @xmath45 for the intercept ) . impact on estimation of the log standard deviation of the random effects was negligible .",
    "as noted , estimation of the @xmath32 and @xmath44 parameters for the tukey distribution introduced instability in estimating the log standard deviation of the random effects .",
    "this led to poor estimation of the intercept for cluster size @xmath46 and for the log standard deviation for cluster sizes @xmath47 and @xmath48 . perhaps surprisingly , the estimation of @xmath32 and @xmath44 had little impact on estimation of @xmath49 .",
    "fitting these models is quite involved , so we give some further details on the simulation .",
    "not all the replications in the simulations achieved convergence via nlmixed . fitting the assumed normal and tukey distribution with known @xmath32 and @xmath44 had excellent convergence rates , all above @xmath50 however , the tukey distribution with estimated @xmath32 and @xmath44 was numerically challenging and convergence rates for @xmath51 and @xmath52 were lower ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively ) , with estimation of @xmath55 especially problematic .",
    "the figures give results for all the runs , using final parameter values in cases with nonconvergence .",
    "comparing the convergent runs only with all the runs showed little impact on the bias of the parameters in figure [ figbias ] , excepting @xmath56 simulation code is available from the authors .",
    "figure [ figsd ] gives the results for the standard deviations of the estimators .",
    "the standard deviations of the estimators were nearly the same under both the fitted normal and tukey distributions across all the cluster sizes and for all the parameters , with the exception being a modest loss of efficiency for the between - cluster covariate , especially with larger cluster sizes .",
    "so misspecifying the random effects distribution produced essentially no loss in estimation efficiency .",
    "since estimation of between - cluster covariates is an important inferential goal in clustered data settings and there is a modest impact of misspecifying the distribution as normal , we give more detail on the actual distributions of the estimates of the between - cluster covariate effect .",

    "the line of argument cited above using minimization of kullback  leibler divergence ( neuhaus , hauck and kalbfleisch , @xcite ; neuhaus , kalbfleisch and hauck , @xcite ; heagerty and kurland , @xcite ) can also be used in the random intercepts and slopes situation .",

    "for the informative cluster size situation , neuhaus and mcculloch ( @xcite ) make these arguments more precise . in the case of prediction of realized values or random effects , mcculloch and neuhaus ( @xcite ) report limited results for random intercepts and slopes ; they show a fair degree of robustness for mean square error of prediction and comparable behavior to the random intercepts case .",
    "contrary to the above , litire , alonso and molenberghs ( @xcite ) describe some simulations for the random intercepts and slopes situation that report to show significant bias for a mixed effects logistic model with true normal or true mixture of normal distributions to which an assumed bivariate normal distribution is fit .",

    "we used the same model as litire , alonso and molenberghs ( @xcite ) , namely , @xmath108\\\\ [ -8pt ] & & \\quad = ( \\beta_0 + b_{0i } ) + \\beta_bz_i+(\\beta_w + b_{wi})t_j,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath109 binary with equal proportions of 0 and 1 , @xmath110 , and 8 ( within each cluster of size 6 ) and 100 clusters .",
    "we performed 500 replications and fit the models via maximum likelihood using sas proc nlmixed assuming a bivariate normal distribution .",
    "table [ tabsimresults ] reports the results .",
    "when fitting to a true normal distribution , the median values when the random slope variance is 5 ( upper panel ) are remarkably close to the true values . when fitting to a  true mixture distribution , the median values exhibit bias , but not nearly as extreme as those reported by litire , alonso and molenberghs ( @xcite ) .",
    "convergence rates when fitting to the mixture distribution are much better as well .",
    "our results are consistent with previous literature , in that the impact on the within - cluster coefficient @xmath111 is less extreme than the between - cluster coefficient , @xmath112 . under the more reasonable random slopes variance of 0.08",
    "there is only a small amount of bias .",
    "of course , it is important to remember that , even under the more reasonable value of the variance , the mixture model is a highly non - normal bivariate distribution with most of its mass concentrated around ( @xmath1002 , @xmath1002 ) and ( 2 , 2 ) .",
    "we considered robustness to the assumed distribution for a random intercept when using maximum likelihood methods for fitting a generalized linear mixed model such as ( [ glmm ] ) . in practice ,",
    "data analysts commonly assume normality for the random effects . theory and simulation studies",
    "indicate that most aspects of statistical inference are highly robust to this assumption .",
    "especially robust were inferences for within - cluster covariate effects , which are often a key reason for considering a clustered data design .",
    "these conclusions are contrary to much of the previous literature .",
    "we have argued that this is because ( a )  results for the nonclustered data situation ( e.g. , heckman and singer , @xcite ) are incorrectly interpreted as relevant to the clustered data setting , ( b ) results restricted to one portion of the model ( primarily the intercept ) are characterized as a general failure of the methodology , and ( c ) reanalysis of previous scenarios has sometimes given different interpretations or results .",
    "exceptions to this robustness include estimation of the intercept , which can be biased when the random intercept distribution is misspecified .",
    "the shape of the estimated random effects distribution ( based on the distributional shape of the predicted random effects ) can also be quite sensitive to the shape of the assumed distribution and thus not reflect the true distribution .",
    "however , a wide array of inferences are quite robust to this type of misspecification , including estimation of covariate effects , estimation of the random effects variance and the mean square error of prediction of the realized value of random effects .",
    "we also argued that this robustness extends to random intercept situations where the cluster size is informative .    between - cluster covariate effects and estimation of the log of the standard deviation of the random effects",
    "were found to be robust , but not impervious , to misspecification of the random effects distribution .",
    "the literature and results here indicate that a  modest amount of bias and minor loss of efficiency can occur , especially when the true distribution is far from the assumed ( e.g. , assuming a normal distribution when the true distribution is a two - point distribution or the tukey distribution investigated here ) , the random effects are large , and the cluster size is large . when random effects and cluster sizes are large , the data provide a fair amount of information as to the shape of the random effects distribution and correctly specifying the random effects distribution gives some advantage .",
    "particularly robust was estimation of within - cluster covariate effects .",
    "this is especially important because exploitation of within - cluster comparisons is often the rationale for conducting longitudinal or clustered data studies .",
    "virtually all the evidence in the literature and the new results reported here indicate that within - cluster covariate effects are estimated with no more bias when fitting a misspecified model than when fitting the correct model and with little or no loss of efficiency .",
