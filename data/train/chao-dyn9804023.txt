    "<S> the asymptotic distance between trajectories @xmath0 , is studied in detail to characterize the occurrence of chaos . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this quantity is quite distinct and complementary to the lyapunov exponents , and it allows for a quantitave estimate for the folding mechanism which keeps the motion bounded in phase space . </S>",
    "<S> we study the behaviour of @xmath0 in simple unidimensional maps . near a critical point </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 has a power law dependence on the control parameter . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , at variance with the lyapunov exponents , it shows jumps when there are sudden changes on the available phase - space .    0.0 in 0.0 in 9.5 in 6.5 in 0.0 in    one of </S>",
    "<S> the most characteristic feature which is emerging when dealing with nonlinear systems is the appearance of chaotic motion . </S>",
    "<S> there has been a considerable amount of work to establish what are the conditions for a nonlinear system ( dissipative or conservative ) to display chaotic dynamics and what are some suitable quantities to characterize it . </S>",
    "<S> the following gives a brief review of the quantities discussed so far in the literature @xcite :    \\i ) the lyapunov exponent ( le ) , the mean rate of separation between two adjacent trajectories in phase space , is one of the most used measures . </S>",
    "<S> a system is chaotic when the trajectories diverge exponentially , i.e. the le is larger than zero .    </S>",
    "<S> \\ii ) the correlation function characterizes the `` memory '' along one trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> it decays quickly to zero in the chaotic regime .    </S>",
    "<S> \\iii ) the power spectrum changes from discrete lines to a broad - band noise when chaos sets in .    </S>",
    "<S> these quantities can be calculated from the nonlinear equations of motion which describe the system . often , however the equations of motion are not known but there might be some experimental determination of the time evolution of a physical quantity . </S>",
    "<S> there are in the literature some suggestions on how to extract the le from a time series @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however the proposed methods are not unique and depend on some working parameters @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other cases of interest exist where there is no information at all about the time evolution of some quantity and final phase space distributions are only known . </S>",
    "<S> for instance in the field of nucleus - nucleus collisions there is an active search for a liquid to gas phase transition at excitation energies of tens mev / particle or a phase transition to a quark gluon plasma at much higher excitation energies . in these experiments the final momentum distributions ( of almost all ) particles are known . </S>",
    "<S> there is absolutely no information about the time evolution of the system and there is no way to estimate the le from data . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , it becomes very important to have hold of some clearly defined physical quantity that could define unambiguously the occurrence of a phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> it is the purpose of this paper to show that there is a quantity , the asymptotic distance between trajectories , which could be easily estimated in such cases where the quantities ( i - iii ) can not be unambiguously determined and which gives for instance as much information as the le alone . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we will describe how the distance between trajectories , which defines the le , saturates because of the finiteness of the available phase space . </S>",
    "<S> we would like to stress that in the literature @xcite particular care has been taken to estimate the le by avoiding such saturation of the trajectories . here </S>",
    "<S> , we are going to do the opposite , i.e. study in detail the saturation properties of trajectories to demonstrate how many physical informations can be obtained from such studies . </S>",
    "<S> we will discuss some illustrative examples using one - dimensional maps . </S>",
    "<S> preliminary studies for hamiltonian systems can be found in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a one - dimensional map can be written as :    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is a control parameter . </S>",
    "<S> such maps , even though apparently very simple , exhibit most of the chaotic features found in more complex systems .    </S>",
    "<S> the appropriate quantity to discuss here is the mean distance between two trajectories separated initially by a very small distance @xmath3 :    @xmath4    and :    @xmath5    in order to avoid fluctuations arising from a particular choice of the starting point for the iterations we average over n couples of trajectories and choose the initial starting points @xmath6 randomly from a uniform distribution . </S>",
    "<S> after n iterations , for small enough initial separation , the approximate n dependence of the distance @xmath7 is :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the lyapunov exponent of the map :    @xmath11    the prime indicates the derivative of the function @xmath12 respect to @xmath13 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the action of the maps consists generally of two steps : the stretching , which leads to the exponential regime and is characterized quantitatively by the le and the folding process which keeps the orbit bounded . </S>",
    "<S> therefore when @xmath14 is sufficiently large , the solution eq.(5 ) is no longer valid . </S>",
    "<S> we can consider eq.(5 ) as a first order expansion in @xmath7 , and in the hypothesis that : _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 for any n _ </S>",
    "<S> , we include a second order correction term in ( [ dist1 ] ) :    @xmath16    note the analogies to the derivation of the logistic map @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us define the asymptotic value of the mean distance between two trajectories as :    @xmath17    the fixed points of ( [ dist2 ] ) are @xmath18 and :    @xmath19    thus , ( [ dist2 ] ) describes the irreversible approach of the system to equilibrium which correspond to the fixed points solution ( 9 ) . from the stability condition @xmath20 @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we find that @xmath21 is a stable point for @xmath22 , while @xmath23 is a stable point for @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> we also stress these particular and interesting cases :    \\a ) @xmath25 gives @xmath26 which is a superstable point of the map @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that such value of the le is obtained in the triangular and logistic maps for a control parameter where the maps become ergodic . </S>",
    "<S> _ thus ergodicity of the maps is equivalent to a superstable point of our proposed application describing the evolution of the distance between trajectories_. also , @xmath18 becomes a superstable point for @xmath28 .    </S>",
    "<S> b)@xmath29 gives @xmath30 which is the value for which the map @xmath27 has a pitchfork bifurcation . in this case the values of @xmath0 at bifurcation are given by the conditions @xmath31 and @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> this and larger value cases of the le are outside the purpose of this paper and will be discussed in a future publication @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the actual value of @xmath33 can be easily obtained inverting ( [ diinf ] ) :    @xmath34    the entire evolution of the distance between trajectories is given by equation ( [ dist2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it contains three characteristic quantities , @xmath35 , @xmath0 and @xmath36 , but only two of them are independent because of the relation ( [ gamma ] ) . to better grasp the meaning of the physical quantities introduced above </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the ( unbound ) map : @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> it easy to show that for this map it is @xmath38 , and @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> if we impose the condition on the map to have modulus 1 ( bernoulli shift ) , the le remains the same while @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the le is only sensitive to the stretching mechanism while @xmath36 is sensitive to the folding and stretching mechanisms , eq.([gamma ] ) : _ its knowledge allows us to distinguish between maps which have the same le_.    in fig.(1 ) we plot @xmath7 versus n as obtained numerically for the logistic , triangular and sin maps , for three different initial values of @xmath3@xcite , full lines . </S>",
    "<S> we observe in all cases that , after a fast increase , the distance between trajectories saturates . </S>",
    "<S> the value of saturation is @xmath0 as defined in ( 8) independent on the initial relative distance @xmath3 . inserting the values of @xmath35 and @xmath0 , as obtained from eqs.(6 ) and ( 8) , in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 7 ) and ( 10 ) , gives the dot points displayed in fig.(1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement to the numerical results is extremely good for all cases and supporting our hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> _ we conclude that in order to have an overall description for the evolution of the mean distance between trajectories , beyond the exponential regime cf . </S>",
    "<S> eq.(5 ) , we need two parameters , @xmath10 and @xmath0 , cf.eq.(7)_.    at the ergodic point , corresponding to fully developed chaos , we can calculate analytically the le and @xmath0 as mean values over the phase space using the corresponding distribution function @xmath41 . we obtain :    @xmath42    for the logistic map . for the triangular map we have @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , the subscript e stands for ergodic . </S>",
    "<S> these values are in perfect agreement with the ones used in fig.(1a ) , and fig.(1c ) .    for other values of the control parameter </S>",
    "<S> it is not possible to calculate analytically @xmath10 and @xmath0 and we have performed some numerical calculations displayed in fig.(2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> figs.(2a ) and ( 2c ) give the le and @xmath0 respectively as obtained from eqs.(6 ) and ( 8) for the logistic map . </S>",
    "<S> the right column refers to the results of the triangular map . recall that the le for the triangular map is given by @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> these are some features of particular interest :    \\i ) at particular values of the control parameter , @xmath0 has jumps which indicate a change in the dynamical behavior . </S>",
    "<S> notice , for instance , the jump near r=0.7 for the triangular map . </S>",
    "<S> this jump , not observed in the le , is due to the sudden increase of the available phase space , because of band splitting bifurcation , see also fig.(2b ) ;    \\ii ) similarly to the le , at the transition to regular windows @xmath0 drops to zero .    </S>",
    "<S> let us study this last point in more detail for the logistic map . </S>",
    "<S> near the transition point from order to chaos , the le behaves like @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the accumulation value of control parameter for the double period bifurcation cascade . </S>",
    "<S> this relation can be easily obtained by means of the renormalization group theory ( rgt)@xcite . within the same framework we can easily derive @xmath0 and obtain@xcite :    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath48    in the inset of fig.(2c ) , we plot the numerical result for @xmath0 vs. r near the critical point . </S>",
    "<S> the full line gives the power law , eq.(14 ) , in very good agreement to the numerical values . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that the critical exponent for @xmath0 depends on both feigenbaum constants @xmath49 and @xmath50 , while the le depends on @xmath50 only . </S>",
    "<S> we have used the symbol @xmath51 in analogy to the treatment of second order phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> infact , the counterpart of the distance between trajectories for maps is given by the variance in momentum space for hamiltonian systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> near a second order phase transition such a variance is proportional to the inverse of the correlation length which depends on @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the critical temperature @xcite .    to make our analogy to phase transitions more complete recall that at the critical point the correlation function , defined as@xcite : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 , decays with a power law in @xmath57 : @xmath58 which depend now only on @xmath49 .    </S>",
    "<S> all above three critical exponents can be related as follows :    @xmath59    which could be considered valid for the transition to chaos through double period bifurcation . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour is similar for all the maps having period doubling chaotic bifurcation , the critical exponents depending on the values of corresponding @xmath49 and @xmath50 constants .    for completeness in fig.(3 ) </S>",
    "<S> we plot the parameter @xmath33 vs. r for three different maps @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we see that this parameter is very large especially near the critical point for the transition from order to chaos , and then it becomes almost constant . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the constant is @xmath60 , eq.(12 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the le is to a good approximation proportional to @xmath0 especially near the ergodic point . </S>",
    "<S> this fact is especially important for equilibrated physical systems since one can deduce the properties of the le from the variances which are given from thermodynamics @xcite .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that a useful quantity to characterize the occurrence of chaos is @xmath0 , the value at which the distance between two trajectories saturates in phase space . it is complementary to the lyapunov exponent giving informations about the global features of phase space . </S>",
    "<S> it signals also when changes in dynamics are having place which are not always reflected in the behavior of the lyapunov exponent . </S>",
    "<S> both parameters _ are needed _ in order to obtain a correct description of the time evolution for the mean distance between trajectories . in analogy to phase transitions , the le is the order parameter while @xmath0 is the inverse of the correlation length . </S>",
    "<S> in some experiments both quantities can be measured , often , however , like in nucleus nucleus or cluster cluster collisions , it is not possible to follow the time evolution of the system and asymptotic quantities , like @xmath0 , can only be detected . </S>",
    "<S> the generalized application for the distance between trajectories proposed in this paper , eq.(7 ) , gives a link between the initial exponential expansion and the final equilibrium stage . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that ergodicity is simply a superstable point of our proposed eq.(7 ) and naturally gives a lyapunov exponent @xmath61 .    * acknolewdgments *    one of the authors ( v.b . ) </S>",
