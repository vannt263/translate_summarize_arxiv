    "the motivations for the study of higher - dimensional gravity   have remained largely invariant since b. zumino s paper _ gravity theories in more than four dimensions _  @xcite ; we may add here that string theory ( st ) has since grown into an all - encompassing framework that guides and inspires research in high - energy physics . among its rich offspring , st provides with a gravity lagrangian which includes , at higher - order corrections in @xmath1 , higher powers of the curvature tensor .",
    "the potential incompatibilities between the ghost particles usually associated with these terms and the ghost - free st were first analyzed in @xcite , where it was pointed out that a proper combination of curvature - squared terms leads to ` ghost - free , non - trivial gravitational interactions for dimensions higher than four ' .",
    "the key point , already conjectured by zwiebach , and confirmed later by zumino , is that the allowed terms in @xmath2 dimensions are the _ dimensional continuations _ of all the euler densities of dimension lower than @xmath2 . for even @xmath2",
    ", one has the seemingly odd choice of also adding the euler density corresponding to @xmath3 , which , being a total derivative , does not contribute to the equations of motion .",
    "however , this term is crucial in order to attain a proper regularization for the conserved charges ( like mass and angular momentum ) @xcite . interestingly enough",
    ", the ghost - free , higher - power - in - curvature lagrangians considered by zumino had been introduced much earlier , in a completely classical context , by d.  lovelock  @xcite ( it is also noteworthy the contribution of c.  lanczos , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "lanczos  lovelock ( ll ) lagrangians have been extensively studied ( for some recent work , check , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "@xmath5   $ ] ghost - free ll lagrangians in @xmath2 dimensions , which can be linearly combined , with arbitrary coefficients @xmath6 , @xmath7   $ ] , into a full - fledged gravity lagrangian .",
    "the first term in the series , without any curvature contributions @xmath8 , corresponds to a cosmological term , while the second one , linear in curvature @xmath9 , is nothing else than the usual einstein ",
    "hilbert ( eh ) lagrangian .    the next major step in our programme is the embedding of the full ll lagrangian into the broader scheme of chern  simons ( cs ) theory .",
    "as first shown by chamseddine  @xcite and baados , teitelboim and zanelli  @xcite , there is a special choice of the @xmath6 coefficients that brings the ll lagrangian in odd dimensions only a total derivative away from a cs lagrangian . to be more explicit ,",
    "take @xmath10 to be a @xmath11-valued , one - form gauge connection   or the anti - de sitter algebra @xmath12 ; we are not making the distinction here . ] and pick the levi - civita symbol @xmath13 as an invariant tensor .",
    "the cs lagrangian built with these two ingredients is then equal to a ll lagrangian ( with the chosen coefficients ) _ plus a total derivative_.    an alternative way of deriving these ` canonical ' coefficients rests on the physical requirement of well - defined dynamics  @xcite .",
    "this argument can also be made in even dimensions , where the resulting lagrangian has a born  infeld - like form , leading to the associated theory being dubbed ` born  infeld ( bi ) gravity ' .",
    "conserved charges for even - dimensional bi gravity can be computed via a direct application of noether s theorem @xcite .",
    "the formula so obtained correctly reproduces mass and angular momentum for a host of exact solutions , without requiring regularization or the subtraction of an ad - hoc background .",
    "this success is however harder to replicate for their odd - dimensional counterpart , cs gravity .",
    "nave application of noether s theorem yields in this case a formula for the charges that fails to give the physically correct values for at least one solution .",
    "a beautiful resolution of this uncomfortable situation has been recently proposed by mora , olea , troncoso and zanelli in  @xcite .",
    "they add a carefully selected boundary term to the cs action which renders it both finite and capable of producing well - defined charges .",
    "although this boundary term is deduced from purely gravitational arguments , the last paragraph in  @xcite already points to the ultimate reason for the action s remarkable properties : it can be regarded as a _",
    "transgression form_.    transgression forms are the matrix where cs forms stem from  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall be mainly concerned with the formulation of what may be called transgression gauge field theory ( tgft ) ; i.e. , a classical , gauge field theory whose lagrangian is a transgression form .",

    "is presented in section [ echf ] , and in section  [ trac ] it is shown to be an extremely useful tool in formulating gravity and supergravity .",

    "this covariant derivative has the ( defining ) property that , if @xmath22 transforms as a tensor and @xmath10 as a connection under @xmath0 , then d@xmath22 will also transform as a tensor .",

    "one important fact to note here is that cs forms are only locally defined . to see this",
    ", we have to consider the following result  @xcite :    ( chern  weil ) .",
    "let @xmath10 and @xmath42 be two one - form gauge connections on a fiber bundle over a @xmath43-dimensional manifold @xmath14 , and let @xmath44 and @xmath45 be the corresponding curvatures . then , with the above notation , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is called a * transgression form * and we have defined @xmath48    a sketch of the proof is given in appendix  [ prcw ] in order to get an intuitive , ` physical ' sense of the theorem s content .",
    "the theorem is also deduced as a corollary of the echf in section  [ cwt1 ] .",

    "weil theorem for this particular case shows that d@xmath51 ; this implies that @xmath52 may be locally written as d@xmath53 for some @xmath53 under gauge transformations .",
    "but since a connection can not be globally set to zero unless the bundle ( topology ) is trivial , cs forms turn out to be only locally defined . of course , this is only a problem if one insists on using a cs form as a lagrangian , since then one has to integrate it over all of @xmath14 to get the action .",
    "nevertheless , cs forms are used as lagrangians mainly because ( i ) they lead to gauge theories with a fiber - bundle structure , whose only dynamical field is a one - form gauge connection @xmath10 and ( ii ) they do change by only a total derivative under gauge transformations . when we choose @xmath54 and write @xmath10 as@xmath55 then the cs form provides with a _ background - free _ gravity theory ( since metricity is given by the vielbein , which is just one component of @xmath10 ) .",
    "an explicit realization of @xmath56 supergravity ( sugra ) in terms of a cs lagrangian has even shed some new light on the old problem of why our world seems to be four - dimensional  @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", a transgression form is in principle globally well defined and also , as we will see , invariant under gauge transformations .",
    "we now turn to the discussion of transgression forms used as lagrangians for gauge field theories  tgft .",

    "there are two major independent symmetries lurking in our tgft action , eq .",
    "( [ st ] ) .",
    "the first of them is a built - in symmetry , guaranteed from the outset by our use of differential forms throughout : it is diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "although straightforward , the symmetry is far - reaching , as is proved by the fact that it leads to non - trivial conserved charges .",

    ", the connections change as @xmath70 invariance of the tgft lagrangian under ( [ ag])([abg ] ) is guaranteed by ( i ) the fact that both @xmath71 and @xmath72 transform as tensors and ( ii ) the invariant nature of the symmetric polynomial @xmath73 .    crucially , and in stark contrast with the cs case , there are no boundary terms left after the gauge transformation : the tgft action ( [ st ] ) is fully invariant rather than pseudo - invariant .",
    "a pseudo - invariant lagrangian is one that changes by a closed form under gauge transformations . in this case",
    "the lagrangian ceases to be univocally defined ; quite naturally , the addition of an _ arbitrary _ exact form can not be ruled out on the grounds of symmetry alone .",
    "a direct consequence is an inherent ambiguity in the boundary conditions that must follow from the action .",
    "any conserved charges computed from a pseudo - invariant lagrangian will also be changed by this modification , rendering them also ambiguous .",
    "a tgft suffers from none of this problems ; we can not add an arbitrary closed form to the lagrangian , since that would destroy the symmetry .",

    "it is not at all obvious that the tgft lagrangian ( [ lcst ] ) and the cs lagrangian ( [ lcs ] ) should differ only by a total derivative .",
    "the fact that they do is associated with the particular form of the invariant polynomial used in both cases , namely the levi - civita tensor . in fact , let us recall that the cs lagrangian locally satisfies @xmath130 whereas the tfgt lagrangian satisfies @xmath131 our choice for the invariant polynomial now implies that @xmath132 and we see that both lagrangians can only differ the way they do .",
