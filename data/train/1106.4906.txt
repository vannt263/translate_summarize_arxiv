    "properties of many - body quantum systems are difficult to compute , because the eigenstates are usually unknown and the large size of the hilbert space makes even approximate descriptions difficult to manipulate . some numerical methods - such as variational methods or mean - field theories - are intrinsically approximate yielding simple expressions describing most of the interesting physical properties , especially in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the so - called `` quasi - exact '' methods do not have such restrictions , and are supposed to converge to the exact quantum result when some parameter tends to infinity .",
    "those include exact diagonalization methods and quantum monte - carlo methods @xcite ( the limiting parameter being the statistical sampling ) . for one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems ,",
    "particularly effective is the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) approach  @xcite .",
    "the states , in modern implementations of the method , are represented by the so called matrix product states ( mps ) ( for a recent smooth introduction , see @xcite ) . in numerous quantum systems ,",
    "the ground state is very well approximated by a  mps , allowing its efficient description with a  relatively small number of parameters , which , moreover , does not increase exponentially with the system size . to some extent , dmrg shares the advantages of both variational and quasi - exact methods .",
    "while the original application of these methods considered stationary properties , recent years brought a big progress in addressing the dynamics . arguably , it was the formulation of the time evolving block decimation ( tebd ) algorithm @xcite , enabling study of real time dynamics of 1d systems of a reasonable size , which triggered a rapid progress in the field .",
    "soon , a time - dependent dmrg ( t - dmrg ) method was proposed @xcite with a fast realization of a close equivalence between tebd and t - dmrg .",
    "various applications of the method addressed dynamics of quantum phase transitions @xcite , quantum quenches and thermalizations  @xcite , periodic driving @xcite , to give just a few examples .",
    "as soon as the evolution of the system ceases to be adiabatic , the excited states become important in the dynamics .",
    "the global properties of whole groups of excited states may be obtained from evaluation of e.g. the spectral function . following the pioneering work of hallberg @xcite ,",
    "a lot of effort has been put in developing efficient schemes for spectral functions evaluations ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .    in the present paper ,",
    "our aims are somehow complementary .",
    "we show how one may obtain selected , dynamically important excited eigenstates of strongly correlated systems in a relatively simple way . instead of addressing spin chain systems , as typical for tests of various dmrg improvements , we shall immediately turn our attention to cold atoms settings and consider a bose - hubbard model as realized by cold atoms in 1d optical lattice potentials . in  @xcite ,",
    "we have shown on such a specific example how to extract the energies of the few lowest excited states of the system , with , however , no access to their properties . in the present paper , we explain how to use the tebd ( or t - dmrg ) method in order to extract some of the excited states with quite good accuracy .",
    "those states are expressed also in terms of mps making the calculations of expectations values and correlation functions easy . while the area law theorem @xcite assures that the ground state may be efficiently represented in mps representation",
    "this is by no means guaranteed for a generic excited state .",
    "our method will work only for those states for which such an efficient mps representation exists .",
    "we shall show , however , that this restriction leaves plenty of interesting ground to explore as , most often , many excited states up to a reasonably large excitation energy , are also efficiently expressed as mpss .",
    "interestingly , the method selects states that are important in the systems dynamics .",
    "it seems more suited for low lying excited states ( although we give other examples too ) .",
    "still , in many - body systems , the density of states increases usually very fast with energy , and even relatively small systems ( such as e.g. encountered in ultracold atomic gases ) have plenty of excited states lying not far above the ground state energy .    while we use as an example the bose - hubbard ( bh ) model describing an ultra - cold atomic bosonic gas loaded in a  one - dimensional optical lattice , the method proposed is quite general and can be used for any system where tebd ( t - dmrg ) works for sufficiently long times .",
    "the latter restriction is necessary since the method is based on fourier transform techniques with resolution being dependent on the integration time .",
    "we shall show later that the method has an unexpected self purifying property allowing sometimes to use much longer integration times than anticipated in standard applications of the algorithm @xcite .",
    "possible future improvements of the method are discussed in the concluding section .    in the following sections ,",
    "we first describe the method in some details .",
    "then , we apply it for extracting selected excited states populated either by the periodic driving or by the non adiabatic dynamics in the disordered bose - hubbard system . the illustrative examples of excited states show the power and the limitations of our approach .",
    "the basic idea is to start from an initial state which is a  `` wavepacket '' , that is a  superposition of various eigenstates , described by a  mps , to propagate it in real time with a  time - independent hamiltonian , finally to combine the mps states at various times to reconstruct the excited states .",
    "the evolution of a  state by a  time - independent hamiltonian with eigenbasis @xmath0 is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 the fourier transform ( ft ) of the autocorrelation function @xmath3 over a  time interval @xmath4 is the autocorrelation spectrum : @xmath5 where @xmath6 in the limit of long time @xmath4 , it yields narrow peaks at the @xmath7 s with weights @xmath8 that allows to determine the energy spectrum as shown in  @xcite .",
    "here we show that it is actually possible to extract from the dynamics also the excited eigenstates with large overlap - those that contribute most to the dynamical wavepacket .",
    "we perform a  ft _ directly _ on the many - body wavefunction @xmath9 @xmath10 for long @xmath11 providing us with the targeted eigenstate .",
    "the method selects excited states _",
    "relevant for the dynamics _ , although myriads of other states may be present in the same spectral region .",
    "this paves the way to study the properties of individual excited many - body states .    to evaluate @xmath12 the integral",
    "is approximated by a  discrete series . to sum the series , a  procedure to perform the sum of two mpss as a mps",
    "is required , which we now briefly sketch .",
    "any state @xmath13 of a 1d system of m sites may be expressed in the mps representation @xcite : @xmath14 , i_1}\\lambda^{[1]}_{\\alpha_1}\\gamma^{[2],i_2}_{\\alpha_1\\alpha_2}\\ldots\\gamma^{[m],i_m}_{\\alpha_{n-1}1 } |i_1,\\dots , i_m\\rangle = : \\mathcal{m}(\\gamma,\\lambda ) \\label{eqn : mps}\\ ] ] where @xmath15,i_l}$ ] are matrices and @xmath16}$ ] vectors and @xmath17 span a local hilbert space on site @xmath18 .",
    "when the @xmath19 s and the @xmath20 s satisfy simple orthogonality relations detailed in  @xcite , their physical interpretation is simple .",
    "for example , the spectrum of the reduced density matrix associated with bipartite splitting @xmath21 , @xmath22 is nothing but @xmath23}_{\\alpha_l}\\right)^2 $ ] for @xmath24 the corresponding entanglement entropy given by @xmath25}_{\\alpha})^2 \\ln(\\lambda^{[l]}_{\\alpha})^2 } , \\label{eq : ent_ent}\\ ] ] is an important tool to characterize the strongly correlated systems , e.g. topological phases  @xcite .",
    "the collection of @xmath20 values forms the entanglement spectrum .    to describe exactly a generic state in terms of a mps , a  large number ( exponentially increasing with @xmath26 ) of @xmath27 values",
    "is needed . however , quite often , physical states created in many experiments are only slightly entangled so that @xmath16}_{\\alpha_l=1,2\\ldots}$ ] are rapidly decaying numbers , which allows for introduction of a  rather small cutoff @xmath28 in all sums above , resulting in tractable numerical computation @xcite .",
    "our approach is limited to such states only .    following  @xcite one has that : @xmath29 the result does not satisfy orthogonality relations that are vital for achieving efficient mps algorithms .",
    "the algorithm to restore them  @xcite ensures that the sum is stored in a  memory - efficient way .",
    "applying the above two - step algorithm to perform elementary addition suffices to obtain @xmath30 the technical details are presented in the appendix .",
    "our goal is to obtain an eigenstate as pure as possible , not merely to detect its presence .",
    "this requires long time integration which may affect the accuracy of the tebd algorithm @xcite .",
    "the integration time may be significantly shortened using few simple ideas which we now describe .    for simplicity",
    "let us restrict to a subspace spanned by two eigenstates @xmath31 as a special case . performing the fourier",
    "transform as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phie ] ) gives : @xmath32 with @xmath33 clearly @xmath34 therefore large enough @xmath4 guarantees convergence of @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "another possibility is to choose @xmath4 such that @xmath37 i.e. a multiple of @xmath38 this ensures that @xmath39 despite relatively short evolution time .",
    "when other eigenstates contribute significantly to the wavepacket , there is no possibility to choose such a time @xmath4 that contributions from other eigenstates vanish simultaneously .",
    "however , if for some state @xmath40 and its eigenstate @xmath41 there exists an eigenstate @xmath42 with nonzero overlap on @xmath43 such that @xmath44 if @xmath45 then choosing @xmath4 as a multiple of @xmath46 is an optimal choice .    if @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psie2 ] ) , a realization of @xmath48 is more difficult .",
    "one solution is to restart the fourier transform evaluation from a partially converged result .",
    "let us first define a map @xmath49 one may verify that for a two - level system , the @xmath50 fold composition of @xmath51 satisfies :    @xmath52 this requires performing evolution for time @xmath53 and results in a power-@xmath50 decay of @xmath54 this observation remains true in the full hilbert space with almost no modification .",
    "another way to obtain the power-@xmath50 decay of other eigenstates is to use a proper _ window function _ @xcite . instead of performing ft as in ( [ eq : phie ] )",
    ", one calculates @xmath55 with @xmath56 called a hahn window , being one possibility .",
    "this window gives a @xmath57 convergence ( instead of @xmath58 without a window ) of @xmath59    further possible improvements will be apparent when discussing specific examples below .",
    "we now illustrate the method using the bose - hubbard ( bh ) model @xcite as realized in a  gas of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice .",
    "we are aware of limitations of the tight - binding bose hubbard description of the system for deep optical lattices @xcite .",
    "the bh model provides , however , a realistic and commonly used simplification of the problem .",
    "a pioneer experiment  @xcite observed a  quantum phase transition ( qpt ) from a  superfluid ( sf ) phase to a  mott insulator ( mi ) , and stimulated research on interacting many - body systems with external perturbations , for a  review see @xcite .",
    "a similar qpt was observed in a 1d realization of the bh model @xcite .",
    "a @xmath60rb condensate was loaded in a  deep two - dimensional  transverse  optical lattice potential realizing an array of one - dimensional atomic tubes .",
    "a shallower optical potential along the tubes coming from a  pair of counter - propagating beams @xmath61 ( in units of the recoil energy @xmath62 ) was superimposed on the system . after preparing the system at different potential depth",
    ", the lattice was modulated periodically at different frequencies measuring the absorbed energy ( for details see @xcite ) . in another realization of this essentially 1d experiment ,",
    "the effects created by disorder were analyzed @xcite .",
    "we shall consider both these situations in the following .",
    "let us consider first the excitations created by a periodic modulation of the lattice .",
    "the problem has been addressed in @xcite where the energy gain due to such a modulation was studied using a 1d bose - hubbard model in a parabolic trap and tebd for the time evolution , obtaining results which were in a qualitative agreement with the experimental spectra @xcite .",
    "recently , a novel extended study appeared @xcite which analyzes in detail different possible excitations in the same model using both t - dmrg and a perturbative approach .",
    "this later calculation considers smaller and simpler system so , for pedagogical reasons , we start our analysis for cases discussed in @xcite .",
    "the 1d bose - hubbard hamiltonian reads : @xmath63 where @xmath26 is the number of sites , @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) is the destruction ( creation ) operator of an atom at site @xmath66 @xmath67 the number operator .",
    "the tunneling amplitude @xmath68 and the interaction energy @xmath69 depend on the lattice depth @xmath70 ( see below ) , @xmath71 is the energy offset of a  given site , due to the harmonic trap with @xmath72 the position of its minimum .",

    "[ fig : ts3c ] , shows two mott plateaus with single and double occupancy . by simulating a periodic driving of the lattice using a real time tebd evolution , we find the absorption spectrum .",

    "we shift slightly the lattice and the bottom of the harmonic trap taking @xmath94 .",
    "this breaks the reflection symmetry of the system with respect to the center of the trap , making the analysis and visualization of the excitations easier .",
    "still , the spectrum for shorter evolution time , @xmath89 ( for @xmath95 the unit of time is the inverse of the recoil energy ) resembles the perturbative theory curve in fig .  2 of @xcite .",
    "longer integration time @xmath90 gives a better frequency resolution and several sharp peaks emerge .",
    "the absorption for time @xmath89 multiplied by a factor of 3 seems to reproduce quite nicely the global amplitude of the broad structure around @xmath96 showing that , for such times , absorption in this frequency region is linear .",

    "this provides us with a wavepacket @xmath109 with a large overlap with the desired eigenstate ( typically 0.7 - 0.9 , while the overlap of the eigenstate with the initial wavepacket was in the range 0.0001 - 0.01 ) .",
