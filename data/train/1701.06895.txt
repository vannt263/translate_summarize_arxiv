    "curvature causes the fourier transform to decay . this observation links geometry to analysis , and lies at the base of several topics of modern harmonic analysis . given the long history of the subject , it is perhaps surprising that the possibility of restricting the fourier transform to curved submanifolds of euclidean space was not observed until the late sixties .",
    "the fourier transform of an integrable function is uniformly continuous , and as such , can be restricted to any subset . on the other hand ,",
    "the fourier transform of a square - integrable function is again square - integrable , and in view of plancherel s theorem no better properties can be expected . in particular , restricting the fourier transform of a square - integrable function to a set of zero lebesgue measure is meaningless .",
    "the question is what happens for intermediate values of @xmath0 .",
    "it is not hard to check that the fourier transform of a radial function in @xmath1 defines a continuous function away from the origin whenever @xmath2 , see for instance  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding problem for non - radial functions is considerably more delicate . to introduce it ,",

    "a complete answer for @xmath10 is given by the celebrated tomas  stein inequality .",
    "[ tomasstein ] suppose @xmath3 has non - zero gaussian curvature at each point of the support of @xmath11",
    ". then the restriction inequality holds for @xmath10 and @xmath12 .",
    "the range of exponents is sharp , since no @xmath13 restriction can hold for @xmath3 if  @xmath14 .",
    "this is shown via the famous knapp example , which basically consists of testing the inequality dual to against the characteristic function of a small cap on @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , some degree of curvature is essential , as there can be no meaningful restriction to a hyperplane except in the trivial case when @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "an example to keep in mind is that of the unit sphere @xmath17 , with constant positive gaussian curvature .",
    "however , nonvanishing gaussian curvature is a strong assumption that can be replaced by the nonvanishing of some principal curvatures , at the expense of decreasing the range of admissible exponents @xmath18 .",
    "the question of what happens for values of @xmath19 is the starting point for the famous restriction conjecture .",

    "let us illustrate this point in two cases , that of solutions @xmath34 to the homogeneous schrdinger equation @xmath35 and that of solutions to the homogeneous wave equation @xmath36 in both situations , @xmath37 .",
    "the following theorem was originally proved by strichartz .",

    "stein exponent in dimension @xmath48 .",
    "it turns out that strichartz estimates for the schrdinger equation correspond to restriction estimates on the paraboloid , whereas strichartz estimates for the wave equation correspond to restriction estimates on the cone .",
    "note that the gaussian curvature of the cone is identically zero because one of its principal curvatures vanishes .",
    "this in turn translates into estimate holding for the strichartz exponent in one lower dimension .",
    "perhaps more significantly , neither of these manifolds is compact .",
    "however , they exhibit some scale invariance properties that enable a reduction to the compact setting .",
    "we shall return to this important point later in our discussion .    in this note , we are interested in extremizers and optimal constants for sharp variants of restriction and strichartz - type inequalities . apart from their intrinsic mathematical interest and elegance , such sharp inequalities often allow for various refinements of existing inequalities .",
    "the following are natural questions , which in particular can be posed for inequalities , and :    1 .   what is the value of the optimal constant ? 2 .",
    "do extremizers exist ? 1 .",
    "if so , are they unique , possibly after applying the symmetries of the problem ?",
    "2 .   if not , what is the mechanism responsible for this lack of compactness ? 3 .   how do extremizing sequences behave ?",
    "what are some qualitative properties of extremizers ? 5 .   what are necessary and sufficient conditions for a function to be an extremizer",
    "?    questions of this flavor have been asked in a variety of situations , and in the context of classical inequalities from euclidean harmonic analysis go back at least to the seminal work of beckner @xcite for the hausdorff  young inequality , and lieb @xcite for the hardy  littlewood  sobolev inequality . in comparison ,",
    "sharp fourier restriction inequalities have a relatively short history , with the first works on the subject going back to kunze @xcite , foschi @xcite and hundertmark  zharnitsky @xcite .    works addressing the existence of extremizers for inequalities of fourier restriction type tend to be a _ tour de force _ in classical analysis , using a variety of sophisticated techniques : bilinear estimates and refined estimates in @xmath49-type spaces @xcite , concentration compactness arguments tailored to the specific problem in question @xcite , variants and generalizations of the brzis ",
    "lieb lemma from functional analysis @xcite , fourier integral operators @xcite , symmetrization techniques @xcite , variational , perturbative and spectral analysis @xcite , regularity theory for equations with critical scaling and additive combinatorics @xcite , among others .",
    "in contrast , a full characterization of extremizers has been given in a few selected cases using much more elementary methods .",
    "this is due to the presence of a large underlying group of symmetries which allows for several simplifications that ultimately reduce the problem to a simple geometric observation .",
    "we will try to illustrate this point in the upcoming sections .    before doing so ,",
    "let us briefly comment on some approaches that have been developed in the last decades in order to establish tomas  stein type fourier restriction inequalities .",
    "for the sake of brevity , we specialize our discussion to inequalities and , but a more general setting should be kept in mind . if @xmath50 denotes the restriction operator @xmath51 , then its adjoint @xmath52 , usually called the extension operator , is given by @xmath53 , where the fourier transform of the measure @xmath54 is given by @xmath55 the tomas  stein inequality at the endpoint @xmath56 is equivalent to the extension estimate @xmath57 if @xmath58 , then the composition @xmath59 is well - defined , and a computation shows that @xmath60 since the operator norms satisfy @xmath61 , the study of these three operators is equivalent , even if the goal is to obtain sharp inequalities and determine optimal constants .",
    "so we focus on the operator @xmath62 .",
    "boundedness of @xmath59 is only ensured if the fourier transform @xmath63 exhibits some sort of decay as @xmath64 .",
    "this in turn is a consequence of the principle of stationary phase , see @xcite , since the nonvanishing curvature of @xmath3 translates into a nondegenerate hessian for the phase function of the oscillatory integral given by with @xmath65 .",
    "this is the starting point for the original argument of tomas @xcite , which was then extended to the endpoint @xmath66 by embedding @xmath62 into an analytic family of operators and invoking stein s complex interpolation theorem .",
    "it is hard not to notice the parallel between the operator @xmath62 and the averaging operator  @xmath67 whose @xmath68 improving properties can be established via the same proof on the fourier side , see for instance @xcite .",
    "a second method to prove restriction estimates goes back to the work of ginibre and velo @xcite .",
    "it consists of introducing a time parameter and treating the extension operator as an evolution operator .",
    "two key ingredients for this approach are the hausdorff  young inequality and fractional integration in the form of the hardy  littlewood  sobolev inequality .",
    "can be proved with a combination of hausdorff  young and hardy  littlewood  sobolev , see for instance @xcite . ]",
    "these methods are more amenable to the needs of the partial differential equations community , and for instance allow to treat the case of mixed norm spaces .    in the special cases when the dual exponent @xmath69 is an even integer",
    ", one can devise yet another proof which comes from the world of bilinear estimates , see for instance @xcite .",
    "one simply rewrites the left - hand side of inequality as an @xmath70 norm , and appeals to plancherel in order to reduce the problem to a multilinear convolution estimate .",
    "for instance , if @xmath71 , then @xmath72 , and @xmath73 similarly , if @xmath32 , then @xmath74 , and @xmath75 in the bilinear case , the pointwise inequality @xmath76 then reveals that one can restrict attention to nonnegative functions .",
    "this observation can greatly simplify matters , as it reduces an oscillatory problem to a question of geometric integration over a specific manifold .",
    "furthermore , an application of the cauchy ",
    "schwarz inequality with respect to an appropriate measure implies the pointwise inequality @xmath77 a good understanding of the convolution measure @xmath78 becomes a priority .",
    "given integrable functions @xmath79 , the convolution @xmath80 is a finite measure defined on the borel subsets @xmath81 by @xmath82 it is clear that this measure is supported on the minkowski sum @xmath83 . in most situations of interest when some degree of curvature is present , one can check that @xmath80 is absolutely continuous with respect to lebesgue measure on @xmath4 .",
    "in such cases , the measure @xmath80 can be identified with its radon  nikodym derivative with respect to lebesgue measure , and for almost every @xmath84 we have that @xmath85 here @xmath86 denotes the @xmath87-dimensional dirac delta distribution . as we shall exemplify",
    "in the course of the paper , expression turns out to be very useful for computational purposes .",
    "+ * overview . *",
    "as we hope to have made apparent already , this note is meant as a short survey of a restricted part of the topic of sharp strichartz and fourier extension inequalities . in  [ sec : noncompact ] we deal with noncompact surfaces , and discuss the cases of the paraboloid and the cone , where a full characterization of extremizers is known , and the cases of the hyperboloid and a quartic perturbation of the paraboloid , where extremizers fail to exist .",

    "a full characterization of extremizers at the endpoint is only known in the case of @xmath88 .",
    "we mention some recent partial progress in the case of the circle  @xmath89 , and observe how the methods in principle allow to refine some related inequalities . in particular , we obtain a new sharp extension inequality on @xmath89 in the mixed norm space  @xmath90 .",

    "the theory of distributions comes into help since these integrals can be viewed as pull - backs of dirac delta distributions @xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath3 is ( locally ) implicitly described as the zero level set of a @xmath212 function  @xmath169 defined on an open subset @xmath213 of @xmath209 and taking values in @xmath214 , @xmath215 and assume that the jacobian matrix @xmath216 of the map @xmath169 has maximal rank at every point @xmath217 .",

    "these rules have been used in the previous sections to carry out explicit computations of convolution measures defined on the various manifolds considered there .      in the codimension @xmath27 case , @xmath230 , we have that @xmath3 is a hypersurface defined by a scalar function .",
