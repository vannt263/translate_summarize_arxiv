    "is considered by physiologists as a natural mechanism of pumping materials in the case of most fluids of the physiological system .",
    "besides physiological applications , the benefit of studies on peristaltic movement , however , extends to a variety of industrial appliances , e.g. roller pumps used to pump caustic or corroding liquids .",
    "many of the essential fluid mechanical characteristics of peristalsis have found important applications in different engineering problems investigated by several researchers .",
    "studies on peristalsis have also many important applications in the design and construction of many useful devices of biomedical engineering and technology , such as artificial blood devices , for example , finger pumps used in the pumping of blood . our earlier communications ( misra et al .",

    "involvement of both the nerve control and the intrinsic properties of muscle cells complicates the mechanism of muscle contraction .",
    "consequently the peristaltic contraction acts as an external force on the tissue structure and travels downwards with a certain speed .",
    "the length of the esophagus is 250 - 300 mm for an adult human being .",
    "when stretched , it becomes more or less a straight tube that extends between the pharynx and the stomach .",
    "the two ends of the esophagus are controlled by the upper esophageal sphincters ( ues ) and the lower esophageal sphincters ( les ) . during resting condition ,",
    "a high contractile pressure of at least 30 mm hg is maintained .",
    "the intraluminal pressure at rest above the ues is maintained equal to the atmospheric pressure . in the thorax",
    "the luminal pressure at rest is typically slightly below the atmospheric pressure , while in the abdomen the pressure is about 10 mm hg above the atmospheric pressure .",
    "the thoracic as well as the intra - abdominal pressures are adjusted by respiration and is maintained at about 5 mm hg . during the pharyngeal phase of swallowing , a mass of food that has been chewed at the point of swallowing , called bolus passes rapidly through the pharynx .",
    "thereby the ues relaxes to atmospheric pressure , and the bolus arrives at the esophagus .",
    "as the intra - bolus pressure adds to about 5 mm hg , a peristaltic contraction wave passes through the ues and then progresses down the esophagus at a rate of 20 - 40 mm / s , transporting the fluid bolus distally .",
    "following the initiation of swallowing , the les actively relaxes in a while to gastric pressure and discloses as the esophageal peristaltic wave forces the bolus into the stomach @xcite .",
    "esophageal peristalsis acts as a pump in transporting a fluid bolus from the upper esophagus to the stomach .",
    "total pumping is not achieved , if the esophagus fails to maintain complete occlusion . often in the region where the aortic arch impresses upon the esophagus",
    ", the esophageal wall occlusion remains incomplete . as a result",
    ", some fluid bolus leaks proximally through the contracted region and is left behind .",
    "when les that helps keep the acidic contents of the stomach out of the throat does not work properly , laryngopharyngeal reflux occurs .",
    "this leads to various discomforts of the body .",
    "for example , an individual may feel bitter test in the throat , uneasiness in swallowing of food bolus , feel burning sensation / pain in the throat and other similar health problems related to stomach .",
    "it may be mentioned that most of the studies on peristaltic transport made by previous authors are not very suitable for applications to those physiological situations where a single wave travels down the length of an organ having finite dimensions ( e.g. esophagus ) .",
    "li and brasseur @xcite dwelt on the said aspects of peristaltic pumping .",
    "they presented a model of peristaltic transport of a newtonian viscous fluid , for arbitrary wave shapes / arbitrary wave number through a finite length tube .",
    "the conventional sinusoidal wave equation was developed by considering the position of the wall as a function of the minimum radius of the tube , which vibrates only in one direction .",
    "this study has got limited application .",
    "it is applicable only when the intake is water or some drink having similar physical properties .",
    "but the movement of food grain bolus , like whipped cream , custard , ketchup , suspensions of corn starch and various masticated food - grains through the esophageal tube exhibits non - newtonian behaviour .",
    "it is , therefore , important to study the peristaltic transport of the food bolus , when the motion is predominantly non - newtonian . while studying the rheological behaviour of some physiological fluids , patel et al .",
    "@xcite carried out experimental investigation and reported some data for some biorheological fluids .",
    "these data indicated that the masticated food - grains may be treated as a power - law fluid , where the power - law index may vary , depending on the type of the food material .    keeping this in view ,",
    "a mathematical model has been developed here to study the peristaltic transport of food bolus through the esophagus , by considering the motion to be governed by ostwald - de waele power law @xcite .",

    "particular emphasis has been paid to investigate the variation of essential local variable pressure together with volume flow rate , the pressure difference between the ends of the tube , representing the esophagus , the velocity distribution , the particle trajectories and the reflux phenomenon .",
    "based upon the present study , a useful comparison has been made between the single wave and wave train effects on the peristaltic transport characteristics of the movement of food bolus .",
    "in studies pertaining to friction dominated flows where axial length scale of velocity variation is large in comparison to the radial scales , use of the lubrication theory has been found to be very effective .",

    "peristalsis in esophagus normally occurs by the propagation of a single wave of active muscle contraction preceded by a single wave of muscle relaxation .",
    "the motion of the wall is directly linked to the pressures within the fluid ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and there is a relationship between the deformation of the esophageal wall as recorded radiographically and the intra - bolus pressures as measured manometrically during food bolus transport . since the esophageal wall is actively forced and the cavity volume at the contraction region is forced to be reduced quickly in the contraction zone , occlusion pressures are high .",
    "the bolus geometries in the contraction region are associated with a rapid increase in pressure toward the point of maximum occlusion .",
    "on the contrary , relaxation is linked with a lack of muscle tone .",
    "the rate of local pressure is so less when the fluid is shear thinning ( @xmath15 ) and is very large when the fluid is shear thickening ( @xmath16 ) compared to a newtonian fluid .",

    "thus the study of the present non - newtonian model contributes to having a better understanding of muscle movement .",
    "moreover , the esophageal wall just distal to the peristaltic wave must be passively forced open by the pressures within the approaching food bolus . in order to overcome the thoracic pressure exterior to the esophagus as well as any residual tension within the esophageal wall",
    ", these intra - bolus pressure needs to be sufficiently high .",

    "reveal that at first the pressure rises slowly and then increases rapidly to a peak as the contraction wave passes , while relaxation is not related with rapid changes in pressure .",
