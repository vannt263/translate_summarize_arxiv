    "quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) , or singularities in the evolution of the ground state properties of a system as a hamiltonian parameter is varied , have been extensively studied for various many - body systems ( _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . recently",
    ", analogous singular behavior has been noted for states throughout the excitation spectrum of certain many - body models  @xcite , namely the lipkin model  @xcite and the interacting boson model ( ibm ) for nuclei  @xcite .",
    "these singularities have been loosely described as `` excited state quantum phase transitions '' ( esqpts )  @xcite . in this article",
    ", we more closely and systematically examine the characteristics of such excited state singularities as phase transitions , to provide a foundation for future investigations .",
    "it is found that excited state quantum phase transitions occur in a much broader class of many - body models than previously identified .",
    "ground state qpts are characterized by a few distinct but related properties .",
    "the qpt occurs as a `` control parameter '' @xmath0 , controlling an interaction strength in the system s hamiltonian @xmath1 , is varied , at some critical value @xmath2 . for specificity , we take the hamiltonian to have the conventional form @xmath3 . at the critical value : ( 1 )",
    "the ground state energy @xmath4 is nonanalytic as a function of the control parameter at @xmath2 .",
    "( 2 ) the ground state wave function properties , expressed via `` order parameters '' such as the ground state expectation values @xmath5 or @xmath6 , are nonanalytic at @xmath2 .",

    "( 3 ) the gap @xmath8 between the ground state and the first excited state vanishes at @xmath2 .",
    "( here we consider only _ continuous _ phase transitions .",
    "more specifically , the systems considered in this article undergo second - order phase transitions , in which discontinuity occurs in the second derivative of the ground state energy and the first derivatives of the order parameters . ) singularities strictly only occur for an infinite number of particles in the many - body system , but precursors can be observed even for very modest numbers of particles . for finite particle number @xmath9 , the defining characteristic of the qpt is therefore not the presence of a true singularity but rather well - defined scaling behavior of the relevant quantities towards their singular large-@xmath9 limits  @xcite .    for the systems which exhibit _ excited state _ qpts , the vanishing gap between the ground state and first excited state at the ground state qpt does not occur in isolation .",
    "rather , there is a bunching of levels near the ground state , that is , a vanishing of the average level spacing @xmath10 or an infinite local level density @xmath11 . the infinite level density , moreover , propagates to higher excitation energy ( as illustrated for a two - level fermionic pairing model in fig .  [ fig - evoln - pairing ] ) as the order parameter is varied from @xmath12 , hence the concept of a continuation of the qpt to excited states .",
