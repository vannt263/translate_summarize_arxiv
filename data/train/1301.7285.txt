    "the potential of hi  ly@xmath0  to identify young galaxies at high redshift was noted over 40 years ago by @xcite .",
    "ly@xmath0  corresponds to the @xmath9 transition and is in principle the strongest emission line originating in an hii  region . in the absence of dust , the ly@xmath0/h@xmath0 line intensity ratio is expected to be in the range @xmath10 for recombination theory cases b - a @xcite , and the ly@xmath0  equivalent width , @xmath11 , is expected to be in the range @xmath12  for metallicities between @xmath13 , a normal initial mass function , a constant star formation rate of 1 m@xmath14yr@xmath7 , and ages below 10 myr @xcite . in the case of a single burst of star formation , the range of @xmath11 is @xmath15 under the same conditions .",
    "a few times @xmath16 yr after a burst of star formation , @xmath11 drops to zero @xcite .",
    "the above predictions do not account for the underlying stellar contribution at ly@xmath0 .",
    "this contribution is not a concern in galaxies dominated by populations of o and early b stars . for reference ,",
    "the mean ly@xmath0  equivalent width of the eight early and mid - o supergiants in @xcite is @xmath171  . on the other hand",
    ", the correction can be significant for stellar populations dominated by a and late b stars .",
    "in addition , the above predictions do not account for the effects of ly@xmath0  radiation transfer in the medium surrounding the starburst .",
    "due to its resonant nature , a ly@xmath0  photon is absorbed and re - emitted multiple times in hi .",
    "resonant trapping reduces the mean free path of the ly@xmath0  photons increasing significantly their probability of being destroyed by dust , shifted in frequency , or transformed to two - photon emission . on the other hand , some effects are favorable to the escape of ly@xmath0  photons from galaxies .",
    "neutral gas outflows doppler - shift the ly@xmath0  photons from the optically thick line core to the optically thin line wings making it possible for some ly@xmath0  photons to escape @xcite .",
    "ly@xmath0  photons may also escape through holes of sufficiently low dust and hi  column densities @xcite .    in spite of the various ly@xmath0",
    "attenuation effects , today , star - forming galaxy candidates have been detected out to redshift @xmath18 using various techniques .",
    "galaxies with redshifts of @xmath19 are detected via the drop - out technique based on the opacity at the lyman - limit of the galaxy and the intervening intergalactic medium ( igm ; @xcite ) .",
    "galaxies with @xmath20 are detected via the drop - out technique based on the opacity of the igm at ly@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "galaxies with @xmath21 are also detected using deep narrow band surveys that target the ly@xmath0  emission - line @xcite .",
    "finally , galaxies at the highest redshifts are detected using gravitationally lensing clusters @xcite .",
    "hundreds of galaxy candidates have been spectroscopically confirmed @xcite , and a few galaxies show impressively high rest - frame equivalent widths of @xmath22150   @xcite , which could alternatively be due to the presence of an agn @xcite .    in principle , after removing the observational and astrophysical biases , ly@xmath0  can be used for various applications .",
    "1 ) to probe cosmic star formation rates @xcite .",
    "2 ) to probe the ionization fraction of the intergalactic medium during the final stages of re - ionization @xcite .",
    "3 ) to probe the large - scale structure @xcite .",
    "4 ) to identify potential hosts of population iii star formation @xcite . 5 ) and to constrain the nature and evolution of high - redshift galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , the use of ly@xmath0  as a cosmological tool is limited by our understanding of the astrophysical processes that regulate the escape of ly@xmath0  photons from galaxies and affect them on their way to telescopes .",
    "the ly@xmath0  escape problem can be approached from two complementary angles , doing statistically significant studies of the global properties of the sources and their cosmological context , or studying individual sources in detail .",
    "the former is better done in the distant universe , whereas the latter can only be accomplished locally , where the effect of the intergalactic medium is a non - issue , the kinematical and spatial resolutions are higher , and ancillary data is abundant .",
    "the challenges of studying ly@xmath0  locally are the necessity of a uv space - based observatory optimized for studying ly@xmath0 ; contamination with the geocoronal ly@xmath0  line , which saturates the spectra at very low redshift ; and contamination with the milky way galaxy ly@xmath0-line trough .",
    "indeed , the interstellar hi in our galaxy produces a damped absorption along many sight - lines , which hides the potential ly@xmath0  line from star - forming galaxies with redshifts below a few @xmath1 km s@xmath7 .",
    "there are several observational ly@xmath0  studies of galaxies at low - redshift ( z@xmath230.3 ) .",
    "@xcite studied low resolution spectra of 21 galaxies taken with the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ iue _ ) and studied the effects of reddening and metallicity on @xmath11 , and ly@xmath0/h@xmath24 .",
    "they found no correlation between these quantities and the uv extinction , the balmer decrement , or the oxygen abundance .",
    "they concluded that rather than the amount of dust , the ism geometry determines the ly@xmath0  escape fraction .",
    "unfortunately , the spectral resolution of _ iue _ is insufficient to study the effect of gas outflows on the ly@xmath0  escape .",
    "@xcite studied high - dispersion _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) ghrs spectra of eight nearby hii  galaxies .",
    "they found four emitters , all of which have a velocity offset between the hi  and the hii  gas of up to 200 km s@xmath7 , while the non - emitters show no velocity offset .",
    "however , their study suffers from small number statistics .",
    "@xcite analyzed the optical spectra of a sample of 31 @xmath25 ly@xmath0 emitters identified by deharveng et al .",
    "( 2008 ) in low resolution ( @xmath26 ) _ galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) _ data .",
    "they tried to reproduce the stellar - absorption corrected ly@xmath0/h@xmath0 and h@xmath0/h@xmath24 ratios using different dust geometries and assumptions for the ly@xmath0  scattering in hi .",
    "they found that the ratios are well reproduced by a clumpy dust distribution , while a uniform dust screen model results in ly@xmath0/h@xmath0  larger than the case b recombination theory value .",
    "unfortunately , the spectral resolution of _ galex _ is insufficient for kinematical studies , and the latter authors were unable to assess the relative importance of dust geometry and outflows .",
    "@xcite used a 3d ly@xmath0  radiation transfer code to model _",
    "observations of the very metal - poor dwarf galaxy i zw 18 , which shows ly@xmath0  in absorption .",
    "their analysis shows that it is possible to transform a strong ly@xmath0  emission of @xmath27ly@xmath0)@xmath2860  into a damped absorption , even with low extinction , if the hi  column density is large .",
    "finally , @xcite used _",
    "hst _  to produce ly@xmath0 , h@xmath0 , and uv continuum maps of six galaxies covering a wide range in luminosity and metallicity , including known ly@xmath0  emitters and non - emitters .",
    "they found that the bulk of ly@xmath0  emerges in a diffuse component resulting from scattering events .",
    "they also found the simultaneous presence of ly@xmath0  in emission and absorption within spatial scales ranging from a few @xmath29 pc to a few @xmath1 pc .",
    "although these studies have addressed main factors affecting the ly@xmath0  escape , we still do not understand the relative importance of starburst phase , gas kinematics , gas geometry , and dust extinction , in determining the profile and strength of the ly@xmath0  line from star - forming galaxies .",
    "we took advantage of the high sensitivity and medium resolution of the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) aboard _ hst _  in order to obtain ly@xmath0  spectroscopy of a sample of 20 galaxies located a mean redshift of 0.03 and covering a broad range of luminosity , oxygen abundance , and reddening .",
    "we used these and ancillary data for establishing correlations between ly@xmath0  and fundamental galaxy properties . in section 2",
    "we describe the sample , the observations , and the ancillary data ; in section 3 we present our analysis ; in section 4 we discuss our results ; and in section 5 we summarize and conclude .",
    "the galaxies in our sample were h@xmath0-selected from the kitt peak international spectroscopic survey data release ( kissr  ] , @xcite ) .",
    "the sample is composed of 12 irregular and eight spiral galaxies distributed in the redshift range @xmath30 . at these redshifts , we avoid contamination with the geocoronal and milky way ( mw ) ly@xmath0  lines .",
    "we cover a factor of three in redshift , which makes it possible to study the effect of distance on the observed properties of ly@xmath0 .",
    "in addition , we cover a broad range in oxygen abundance , @xmath31 , which makes it possible to study the effect of metallicity on the ly@xmath0  escape .",
    "metallicity is expected to correlate with the dust content , and dust destroys ly@xmath0  photons .",
    "we also cover a wide range in h@xmath0 equivalent width , @xmath32  .",
    "the value of @xmath33 is sensitive to the starburst evolutionary phase and to the initial mass function ( imf ) , e.g. , see @xcite . finally , we cover over an order of magnitude in _ galex _ @xcite fuv continuum luminosity , @xmath34 erg s@xmath7 @xmath7 ( uncorrected for reddening ) . for a given star formation history ( sfh ) , age , and imf ,",
    "@xmath35 is proportional to the stellar mass in the population dominating the fuv emission of the galaxy .",
    "therefore , @xmath35 can be used to determine the star formation rate of this population ( sfr = stellar mass / time since beginning of star formation ) .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] summarizes the properties of the sample .",
    "the morphological types are based on sdss images .",
    "the h@xmath0 equivalent widths are from the sdss spectra when available or from the kiss data otherwise , as indicated in column ( 10 ) of table  [ tab1 ] .",

    "the center of the aperture is indicated by the small black cross . in 12 cases , a clear source centroid associated with young star clusters",
    "is present .",
    "however , in eight cases , there is no clear centroid of the emission .",
    "this is due to the short exposure times of the ta images and in two cases , i.e. , for kissr galaxies 40 and 1567 , to ta failures . in spite of the ta failures ,",

    "this is in agreement with the finding of @xcite that the ly@xmath0  emission is not necessarily coincident with regions of high fuv surface brightness .",

    "the cos spectra include the intrinsic lines ly@xmath0  and a number of low - ionization ( lis ) and higher - ionization interstellar lines .",
    "we are interested in comparing the offsets of these lines with respect to h@xmath0 .",
    "this is for two reasons .",
    "first , as mentioned in the introduction , velocity offsets between the hii  gas traced by h@xmath0 and the hi  gas traced by the lis lines have been showed to favor the escape of ly@xmath0  from galaxies .",
    "second , in expanding - shell radiation transfer models the ly@xmath0  emission line is redshifted to a few times the shell expansion velocity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a similar offset is observed at high redshift when comparing the ly@xmath0  redshift to the blueshift of the lis lines , which give the expansion velocity ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , offset measurements are useful for establishing how the ly@xmath0  strength relates to the interstellar gas kinematics and for constraining radiation transfer models .",
    "the accuracy of the velocity offset measurements depends on the accuracy of the wavelength zero point and on the effective spectral resolution of the data .    in ultraviolet spectroscopic studies of low - redshift galaxies ,",
    "it is common to use geocoronal emission lines to check if the wavelength zero point is shifted due to instrumental effects , and milky - way metal absorption lines to check if the wavelength zero point is shifted due to the asymmetry of the target in the aperture ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "figures  [ fig4]-[fig8 ] show the cos spectra of the galaxies .",
    "they are contaminated with some or all of the geocoronal emission lines hi  @xmath81216 , ni@xmath81200 , and/or oi @xmath81302 , 1305 ; and with the milky way ( mw ) absorption lines , siii  @xmath81190 , 1193 , 1260 , 1304 , siiii @xmath81206 , oi 1302 , 1305 , and/or cii  @xmath81334 , 1336 .",

    "the mw lines arise from absorption in halo clouds that may have non - negligible heliocentric velocities . for this reason",
    ", we analyzed the hi 21 cm emission from intermediate velocity clouds ( ivcs ) along the lines of sight to our targets .",
    "the data are from the lab hi  survey @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig9 ] we compare the centroids of the hi  ivc emission lines and the mw siii  @xmath81990 absorptions . the siii  absorptions are corrected for the wavelength offset given by the geocoronal lines .",
    "the hi  21 cm emission is the mean within the radio beam at each velocity .",
    "we chose siii  @xmath81990 because it is the only mw line that is not blended with other lines for any of the targets . the hi  component near 0 km s@xmath7 originates in the mw disk .",
    "we find that the maximum ivc  cloud velocity is @xmath50 km s@xmath7 in the local standard of rest frame ( e.g. , kissr 40 , 1567 , and 1578 ) .",
    "although the comparison between the 21 cm emission and the cos data is difficult in cases where the signal to noise of the cos data is low , in general , the 21 cm emission and the siii absorption overlap .",
    "however , in some of the highest signal - to - noise cases ( e.g. , kissr 242 , 1578 , 2019 , and 2110 ) , the minimum of the absorption is blueward of the bluest 21 cm emission peak .",
    "note that the radio beam is large in comparison with the cos aperture , which makes this wavelength calibration method imperfect .",
    "since large offsets between the 21 cm and the cos data are unlikely to be due to shifts in the wavelength zero point , we decided to only correct the cos data for the small shift in the geocoronal lines .    regarding the spectral resolution , the more extended the source , the worse the effective spectral resolution , and the worse the accuracy in the determination of line centroids .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows that some targets are more extended than others .",

    "we used the theoretical libraries of @xcite corresponding to @xmath84 , 0.004 , 0.008 , 0.020 , and 0.040 . for comparison , we also computed models with the empirical galactic and lmc / smc stellar libraries",

    "the empirical models use tracks corresponding to @xmath85 or @xmath87 .",
    "our grid of models includes single stellar population ( ssp ) and continuous star formation ( csf ) scenarios .",
    "continuous star formation is more appropriate in our case , as the observed spectra include light from regions of a few kpc in size and such large regions must contain uv - bright star clusters that span a range of ages .",
    "the ssp models are for comparison .",
    "we adopted a kroupa imf @xcite , as at the high - mass end , it is considered to be universally applicable @xcite .",
    "we used the geneva stellar evolution tracks for non - rotating single - stars with high - mass loss @xcite because models that account for stellar rotation and binarity @xcite are still under development and require calibration against observations over our range of metallicities .",
    "finally , we did not compute models for times earlier than 2 myr because this is the age of the youngest lmc main - sequence o stars , or greater than 30 myr after the beginning of star formation since the ssp models are affected by incompleteness of the stellar libraries beyond this time and the continuum slope and age - sensitive stellar - wind lines of csf models do not significantly change beyond this time .",

    "a comparison of the theoretical and empirical models in figures  [ fig12 ] and  [ fig14 ] shows that at both ages and at all metallicities , nv is stronger for the csf models than for the ssp models , although the difference is less at the lowest metallicity ( e.g. , for 2019 and 2110 ) .",
    "furthermore , the theoretical csf models yield stronger nv profiles than the empirical models at similar ages and metallicities ( e.g. , 40 and 242 ) .",
    "conversely , the theoretical siiv profiles show weaker emission components than the empirical ones . these differences do not severely affect our results .",
    "the observed nv  profiles of ly@xmath0  emitters 298 , 326 , and 1567 are contaminated with geocoronal oi lines , and the siiv profiles of 11 targets , including four of the seven emitters , are either incomplete or have low signal to noise .",
    "for this reason , and because the siiv profiles from the theoretical models are too weak compared to observations at young ages ( e.g. , compared to the empirical models ) , in the rest of our age - dating analysis , we concentrate on the nv profiles . for targets with clean nv profiles , we find that the theoretical ssp models tend to be a better fit than the theoretical csf models , except at the lowest metallicity ( e.g. , kissr 2019 and 2110 ) , where the ssp and csf nv profiles are very similar .",
    "this is true for the ly@xmath0  emitters as well as for the ly@xmath0  absorbers .",

    ", ly@xmath0  absorbers such as spiral galaxy kissr 218 and metal - poor galaxies kissr 2019 and 2110 have strong nv profiles and large h@xmath0 @xmath44s indicative of ages younger than @xmath1710 myr .",
    "thus , they would be expected to have strong ly@xmath0  emission .",
    "however , they are absorbers , which is consistent with their low gas - flow velocities ( see table  [ tab5 ] ) .",
    "in addition , one can not rule out attenuation of ly@xmath0  due to the presence of dust .",
    "we also find that the emitters have ly@xmath0  equivalent widths that are consistent with their young ages , but that are small compared to model predictions for young starbursts .",
    "thus , the emitters also require the presence of scattering in hi and attenuation by dust .",
    "the take away point is that even at young ages ( @xmath90myr ) targets can show ly@xmath0  in absorption if the gas surrounding the starburst is almost static or if the dust column density surrounding the hot stars is significant .",
    "table  [ tab7 ] gives the stellar masses and star formation rates derived from the uv spectra by adopting the ages in the second column of the table . for a given age , metallicity , imf , and star formation history ,",
    "the theoretical value of @xmath63 only depends of the mass of the stellar population .",
    "we give two estimates of the mass and the star formation rate , one corresponding to the ssp and the other to the csf model .",
    "the masses are derived from the comparison of the observed and computed luminosities of the stellar continuum at 1500   ( both dust - free ) . for the computed luminosity",
    ", we use the mean of the theoretical and empirical predictions at the adopted age and metallicity . note that for the ssp models",
    ", it is common practice to define a characteristic star formation rate as the ratio of the stellar mass to the age of the population .",
    "this is what we quote in column 5 of table  [ tab7 ] . for comparison",
    ", the table also gives the star formation rate derived from the sdss h@xmath0 luminosity ( corrected for reddening using the starburst attenuation law of @xcite ) and equation ( 2 ) in @xcite .",
    "we recall that the sdss aperture is very similar to the cos aperture .",
    "this is not the case for the kiss data , therefore , we omit the optical sfr for targets without sdss data .",
    "we also recall that the star formation rates are not global values .",
    "we find that the ssp models yield higher masses and star formation rates than the csf models by a factor of 1.4 ( median ) .",
    "this is because csf models predict larger values of @xmath63 than the ssp models at the adopted ages .",
    "we also find that the ssp models yield systematically higher star formation rates than those derived using h@xmath0 by a factor of 5 ( median ) with a standard deviation of 7 .",
    "the uv ssp sfrs derived from @xmath63 should be viewed with caution as they are inversely proportional to the ages , which are expected to be underestimated by a factor of a few in cases where nv is contaminated with geocoronal emission or does not show a strong p - cygni profile .",
    "this is the case for kissr 298 and 1637 , which show the largest disagreement between the optical and the uv sfrs .",
    "in addition , the uv ssp sfrs depend on the masses , and wofford et al .",
    "( 2011 ) found systematically higher masses derived from @xmath63 compared to masses derived from optical photometry for individual star clusters . on the other hand , in some cases , the agreement between the optical and uv sfrs is very good .",
    "this is the case for kissr 1578 , a target with a prominent nv doublet and a high s / n spectrum .",
    "unfortunately , only four emitters have h@xmath0 sfrs , which makes it difficult to study trends between ly@xmath0  and the sfr .",

    "if a homogeneous hi  layer covers most of the hii  region , the value of @xmath27ly@xmath0 ) is expected to depend on the dust extinction because the ly@xmath0  line flux is more strongly reduced ( due to multiple scattering effects ) than the adjacent continuum .",
    "reddening due to the presence of dust is expected to increase with metallicity .",
    "we use oxygen as a gauge of metallicity .",
    "we re - derived the oxygen abundances of the 16 galaxies with sdss spectra using the method described in @xcite . in summary , in cases where the weak [ oiii ] @xmath84363 line was not detected , we used the mean of the oxygen abundances derived from the ep and sdss coarse calibrations , and in cases where the r23 abundance could be computed , we used the mean of the ep , sdss and r23 abundances ( all methods are defined in @xcite ) .",
    "the oxygen abundances from the kissr and the sdss data are in agreement within the uncertainties and the final values are those given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "we find that the two most metal - poor and least reddened galaxies , kissr 2019 and 2110 , show ly@xmath0  in pure absorption , while the most metal - rich and most reddened galaxy , kissr 298 , has the highest value of @xmath103 .",
    "strong ly@xmath0  emission is expected from kissr 2019 and 2110 based on the strength of their nv profiles and their high values of @xmath109 ( @xmath110  ) , which are characteristic of a young burst of star formation . however , these two targets show ly@xmath0  in absorption . this is not surprising",
    "given that this is also the case for i zw 18 , the most metal - poor galaxy in the local universe @xcite .",
    "although we suffer from small number statistics , the lack of one to one correspondence between the strength of ly@xmath0  and metallicity / reddening is in agreement with the work of @xcite , which is based on larger optical and ultraviolet apertures than what we use in the present study .",
    "therefore , it is not clear that larger aperture measurements yield a different result regarding ly@xmath0  versus metallicity .",
    "our upcoming ly@xmath0  plus h@xmath0/h@xmath24 ratio maps of three of the galaxies in our sample should help establish the role of dust and metallicity in regulating the ly@xmath0  escape .",
    "these maps will be obtained as part of _ hst _",
    "go-12951 and will enable the measurement of spatially resolved and integrated ly@xmath0  and reddening values .",
    "1 .   we used the  _ hst _  cos to observe 20 nearby ( @xmath111 )",
    "galaxies spanning a broad range in properties ( table  [ tab1 ] ) . our data covers the wavelength range @xmath40",
    "  and samples circular regions of 0.9 - 2.4 kpc in radius within each galaxy . we studied correlations between the ly@xmath0  line properties and galaxy properties including distance , metallicity , reddening , starburst phase , and gas flow properties .",
    "our study includes the analysis of ancillary optical spectroscopy from sdss and kiss .",
    "based on the bpt diagram ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) , the galaxies are dominated by star - formation except for kissr 1084 , which is of composite spectral type .",
    "we found ly@xmath0  profile shapes representative of what has been observed between redshifts of @xmath112 and @xmath113 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , including strong absorptions , p - cygni profiles with redshifted emission , and double emission ( figure  [ fig10 ] ) .",
    "3 .   seven out of the 20 galaxies have net ly@xmath0  emission , including spiral and irregular galaxies and composite galaxy kissr 1084 ( figures  [ fig3 ] and  [ fig10 ] ) .",
    "for these seven emitters , the ly@xmath0  equivalent width is in the range @xmath5    and the range of escape fractions within the cos aperture is @xmath5 % ( table  [ tab6 ] ) .",
    "the comparison with escape fractions at higher redshifts is complicated by the fact that at higher redshifts , observations include more if not all of the galaxy in the aperture .",
    "4 .   a face - on spiral , kissr 298 , shows two peaks of ly@xmath0  emission separated by 370 km s@xmath7 , one blueshifted and one redshifted and half as strong . unfortunately , we were unable to determine if this profile is a strong emission with absorption within , as lis lines for this galaxy are too noisy .",
    "5 .   excluding kissr 298 ,",
    "the emitters have ly@xmath0  peaks redshifted to @xmath114 km s@xmath7 with respect to h@xmath0 ( mean @xmath52 standard deviation ) .",
    "including all emitters , the mean oi @xmath81302 and cii @xmath81334 absorption blueshifts are @xmath115 and @xmath116 km s@xmath7 .",
    "therefore , excluding kissr 298 , the ly@xmath0  redshift is larger than the interstellar absorption blueshift by approximately a factor of @xmath61 , as found at high redshift ( e.g. shapley et al . 2003 ) , and in agreement with radiation transfer models ( e.g. , verhamme et al .",
    "2006 ) . 6 .   for the absorbers , ly@xmath0  is centered at @xmath117 km s@xmath7 and oi and cii have centroids at @xmath118 and @xmath119 km s@xmath7 . thus , most absorbers are consistent with having static or low velocity hi  gas .",
    "this supports earlier findings ( e.g. of kunth et al .",
    "1998 ) . 7 .",
    "the outflow velocity of si iii @xmath81206 is typically , @xmath62 km s@xmath7 greater than that of the hi  gas ( table  [ tab5 ] ) .",
    "we found no one to one correspondence between the strength of ly@xmath0  and the reddening / metallicity measured within the cos aperture ( tables  [ tab6 ] and  [ tab7 ] ) .",
    "in particular , we found three low - inclination spirals each showing different ly@xmath0  profiles , i.e. , pure absorption , double emission , and p - cygni profile , and the two most metal - poor and least - reddened galaxies in our sample are pure absorbers .",
    "we find stellar populations consistent with ssps of ages in the range 5 - 10 myr among the ly@xmath0  emitters and the ly@xmath0  absorbers .",
    "similarly , we detect signatures of the presence of wolf - rayet stars among the emitters and the absorbers .",
    "therefore , a young starburst does not guarantee strong ly@xmath0  emission . 10 . in conclusion ,",
    "a picture emerges where the ly@xmath0  photons escape through regions of low hi  and dust column densities , where gas outflows are occurring .",
    "11 . in _ hst _",
    "cycle 20 , we will map three low - inclination spirals from our sample in the ly@xmath0  line and the h@xmath24/h@xmath0 ratio ( proxy for dust attenuation ) . this will make it possible to study the relative importance of gas flows and dust content in regulating the ly@xmath0  escape .",
