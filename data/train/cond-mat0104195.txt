    "the topic of non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) behavior in @xmath5 dimensions and normal ( non - symmetry broken ) phase ( np ) is currently of great interest @xcite .",
    "this is mainly due to the large amount of experimental results , obtained in principle in the last decade , showing nfl behavior in the np of a variety of materials , including @xmath5 dimensional systems of great interest .",
    "examples are : high @xmath6 superconductors @xcite , heavy - fermions @xcite , layered systems @xcite , quasi - one dimensional conductors , doped semiconductors , systems with impurities , materials presenting proximity to metal - insulator transitions @xcite , etc .",
    "these results changed considerably our understanding of interacting fermi systems . indeed , until recently , fermi - liquid ( fl ) theory seemed universally applicable to all sufficiently pure interacting fermi systems , and its main features even to dirty systems , provided that their np is not destroyed by a symmetry breaking process @xcite .",
    "this `` dogma '' has been based on high precision experimental verifications in liquid @xmath7 and simple metals @xcite .",
    "the concept of fl itself has been introduced by landau many decades ago @xcite ( for a thorough discussion see @xcite ) , and in principle has the meaning that in spite of the interactions , the low energy behavior can be well described within a picture of almost noninteracting quasi - particles . formulated in rigorous terms @xcite , in a normal fl",
    "we have a one - to - one correspondence between the non - interacting and interacting single - particle states ( determined e.g. , by a perturbation theory convergent up to infinite orders ) .",
    "furthermore , a quasi - particle pole is present in the single - particle propagator that gives rise to a step - like discontinuity of the momentum distribution function @xmath1 at the fermi surface , whose position is specified by a sharp fermi momentum value @xmath8 .",
    "the observation of nfl behavior in the materials presented above polarized a huge intellectual effort in the last decade @xcite for the understanding of this new fermionic state .",
    "in this field the theoretical interpretations are often based on multi - band models @xcite , the presence of a some kind of gap in the np being clearly established in many cases and subject of intensive experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies . however , despite the great number of papers published in the field ( see for example the references cited in @xcite or @xcite ) , and the fact that the observed most interesting and important normal nfl properties emerge in two spatial dimensions ( 2d ) , ( for example the normal phase of the high @xmath6 superconductors ) , on the theoretical side , for pure systems , the existence of a nfl state in a np has been proved exactly only in one dimensions ( i.e. luttinger liquid @xcite ) .",
    "the extension possibility of nfl - np properties to 2d has not been demonstrated rigorously up today .",
    "in fact , a rigorous theory of a nfl normal state in higher than one dimensions is missing .    driven by these state of facts , we started to focus our attention on possible nfl states using exact methods which are applicable in higher than one dimensions as well @xcite .",
    "based on the obtained results and a conjecture made by us@xcite , in this paper we are reporting the first rigorously derived nfl state in 2d .",
    "we deduced for this reason exact solutions for a real space version of the periodic anderson model ( pam ) in 2d .",
    "the model is analyzed on a two dimensional square lattice , in case of non - vanishing and finite hubbard on - site repulsion @xmath4 . in the paper in fact two",
    "qualitatively different solutions are described : a completely localized and a non - localized one , which represents the first exact results reported for pam in 2d and finite @xmath4 .",
    "the solutions are valid on two surfaces of the parameter space , i.e. on restricted , but continuous and infinite regions of the @xmath9 phase diagram , extended from the low @xmath4 to the high @xmath4 regions up to @xmath10 at @xmath11 .",
    "the derived non - fermi liquid state is given by a flat band effect in multi - band systems with more than half filling .",
    "the obtained properties are extremely peculiar : the system in case of the described solution possesses a well defined fermi energy @xmath2 in conditions in which the @xmath8 fermi momentum can not be defined , and the @xmath1 momentum distribution function is continuous together with its derivatives of any order .",
    "the system has also a natural built in gap , which is clearly present in the density of low lying excitations at high @xmath4 .",
    "the state is paramagnetic and non - insulating .",
    "the gap symmetry is a possible symmetry allowed by the described 2d lattice , and depends on the starting parameters of the system .",
    "the state emerges in the proximity of a mott insulating phase when lattice distortions in the unit cell are present . during low lying excitations quasi - particles",
    "are not created above the fermi level , only the number of particles increases at @xmath2 .    concerning the flat band features ( fbf ) , we mention that such characteristics have been clearly observed in different systems where strong electron interactions and strong correlation effects play a main role . on numerical side ,",
    "fbf are present for example in results connected to 2d hubbard model @xcite , or 2d @xmath12 model @xcite .",
    "experimentally fbf are seen in angle - resolved photo - emission ( arpes ) data of high @xmath6 cuprates @xcite . for layered systems arpes often shows main bands without any sharp characteristics in @xmath1 @xcite , or give results interpreted via fbf assumptions@xcite .",
    "band structure calculations for these systems often reflects a fermi level positioned exactly at the bottom of a conduction band with large effective mass around its minimum , below which a gap is present @xcite .",
    "we further wish to mention that connections between superconductivity and fbf were also clearly pointed out by imada et al .",
    "@xcite , and fbf can be seen as well in experiments related to heavy - fermion materials@xcite . on the technological side ,",
    "for example lammert et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that squashing carbon nanotubes , fbf can be achieved around @xmath2 , where a mismatch of nearly isoenergetic @xmath3 states may have unexpected application possibilities .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is constructed as follows : section ii .",
    "presents in detail the analyzed model and the general form of the deduced ground - state wave - functions .",
    "section iii . characterizes the obtained solutions from the point of view of the @xmath3 - space representation of the hamiltonian and wave - vectors described , and section iv . analyzes magnetic properties of the system in the studied ground - states .",
    "section v. describes a completely localized insulating solution , section vi . presents the new non - fermi liquid state in normal phase and 2d , section vii .",
    "summarizes the paper , and the appendix , containing mathematical details , closes the presentation .",
    "we are describing in this section the model we use and the ground - states detected for it in restricted domains of the phase diagram .",
    "we are considering in this paper a 2d square lattice described by a two - band model whose hamiltonian for the start is given in direct space , containing on - site repulsive interaction in one band .",
    "the starting point will be sufficiently general in order to give us the possibility to characterize in detail the state we are presenting .",
    "however , the model contains also restrictions .",
    "based on physical considerations , and denoting by @xmath13 the positions of the @xmath14th neighbors of a given but arbitrary lattice site , we are taking into consideration in this paper only the @xmath15 ( i.e. nearest , and next - nearest neighbor ) contributions in the hamiltonian . with these considerations ,",

    "it describes a square lattice containing fermions distributed in two bands @xmath34 .",

    "the hybridization between the bands is composed from on - site @xmath39 and @xmath14th neighboring sites hybridizations @xmath40 . as can be seen , in eq.([ez01 ] )",
    "the non - local hybridization @xmath41 contains the nearest - neighbor ( @xmath42 ) and the next - nearest - neighbor ( @xmath43 ) contributions only , the @xmath44 , @xmath45 long - range terms being considered negligibly small . the on - site energy @xmath46 for the second band fixes the relative position of the two bands , and finally , @xmath4 represents in fact the on - site coulomb repulsion in the second band @xmath47 , making the model interacting ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "we mention that @xmath4 is present on all lattice sites . in order to help the reader in a better understanding of the notations",
    ", we are presenting in fig.1 .",
    "the hopping amplitudes for @xmath49-electrons ( a ) , and hybridization matrix elements for @xmath50 type transfers ( b ) .",
    "the hopping amplitudes for @xmath51-electrons , and the hybridization matrix elements for @xmath52 type transfers are similar . for them , only the index @xmath49 has to be changed in @xmath51 in fig.1.a . , and",

    "we concentrate in this paper on a specific region of the phase diagram of the model @xmath56 .",
