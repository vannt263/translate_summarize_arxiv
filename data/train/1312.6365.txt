    "have been well quantified , starting within 1gyr of the big bang .",
    "it has been shown that the comoving cosmic star formation rate density rose gradually from early epochs ( at least z@xmath668 ) to a peak level between z@xmath63 and  1 , after which it dropped by an order of magnitude towards the present ( hopkins & beacom 2006 , bouwens et al.2010 ) .",
    "the build - up of stellar mass ( i.e. the temporal integral ) follows this evolution ( ilbert et al . 2009 ; bell et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the redshift range z@xmath613 constitutes the ` epoch of galaxy assembly ' , when roughly half the stars in the universe formed .",
    "while progress in deep field studies has been impressive , current knowledge of the formation of the general galaxy population is based almost exclusively on optical , near  ir and cm  radio deep field surveys of stars , star formation , and ionized gas .",
    "for example , lyman break selected samples have revealed a major population of star  forming galaxies at z@xmath63 ( e.g. , steidel et al .",
    "2004 ) . likewise ,",
    "magnitude  selected samples ( e.g. , le fvre et al .  2005 ,",
    "lilly et al .  2007 )",
    "provide a census of the star - forming population based on uv / optical flux rather than color .",
    "selected sources provide estimates of dust  unbiased star formation rates ( e.g. , cowie et al.2004 , dunne et al .",
    "2009 , karim et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "the molecular gas content is the cause of the cosmic star formation history .",
    "however , observations of the gas content have to date been limited to follow  up studies of galaxies that are pre  selected from optical / nir deep surveys ( or , in the extreme cases of quasar host galaxies and sub  millimeter galaxies , through selection in the sub ",
    "millimeter continuum , carilli & walter 2013 ) . in all cases",
    "the selection is based on the star formation properties of a given galaxy .    in order to obtain an unbiased census of the molecular gas content in high  z galaxies",
    ", there is a clear need for a blind search of molecular gas down to mass limits characteristic of the normal star forming galaxy population , i.e. , a molecular deep field .",
    "such a molecular deep field has been out of reach using past instrumentation , both in terms of sensitivity and instantaneous bandwidth .",
