    "spectroscopy of hadrons containing heavy flavours has attracted considerable interest in recent years due to many experimental facilities such as the bes at the beijing electron positron collider ( bepc ) , e835 at fermilab , and cleo at the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) @xmath8 , worldover .",
    "they have been able to collect huge data samples in the heavy flavour sector . where as b - meson factories , babar at pep - ii and belle at kekb are working on the observation of new and possibly exotic hadronic states .",
    "all these experiments are capable of discovering new hadrons , new production mechanisms , new decays and transitions and in general will be providing high precision data sample with better stastics and higher confidence level . after having played a major role in the foundation of qcd , heavy hadron spectroscopy has witnessed in the last few years a renewal of interest led by the many new data coming from the b factories , cleo and the tevatron and by the progress made in the theoretical methods .",
    "the remarkable progress at the experimental side , with various high energy machines such as babar , belle , b - factories , tevatron , argus collaborations , cleo , cdf , d  _ etc . , _ for the study of hadrons has opened up new challenges in the theoretical understanding of light - heavy flavour hadrons .",
    "the existing results on excited heavy - light mesons are therefore partially inconclusive , and even contradictory in several cases .",
    "the predictions of masses of heavy - light system for ground state as well as excited state are few from the theory @xcite . in the open charm sector ,",
    "the observation of a charm - strange state , the @xmath9 state @xcite by babar collaboration .",
    "it was confirmed by cleo collaboration at the cornell electron storage ring @xcite and also by belle collaboration at kek @xcite . besides",
    ", babar had also pointed out to the existence of another charm - strange meson , the @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this resonance was measured by cleo @xcite and confirmed by belle @xcite .",
    "belle results @xcite are consistent with the spin - parity assignments of @xmath11 for the @xmath12 and @xmath13 for the @xmath10 .",
    "thus , these states are well established and confirmed independently by different experiments .",
    "they present unexpected properties , quite different from those predicted by quark potential models .",
    "if they would correspond to standard @xmath14wave mesons made of a charm quark and a strange antiquark their masses would be larger @xcite , around 2.48 gev for the @xmath9 and 2.55 gev for the @xmath10",
    ". they would be therefore above the @xmath15 and @xmath16 thresholds , respectively with being broad resonances .",
    "however the states observed by babar and cleo are very narrow , @xmath17 mev for the @xmath9 and @xmath18 mev for the @xmath10 .",
    "+ in near future , even larger data samples are expected from the bes - iii upgraded experiments , while the b factories and the fermilab tevatron will continue to supply valuable data for few more years . later on , the lhc experiments at cern , panda at gsi _ etc .",
    "_ , will be accumulating large data sets which will offer greater opportunities and challenges particularly in the field of heavy flavour physics @xcite .",
    "+ at the hadronic scale the nonperturbative effects connected with complicated structure of qcd vacuum necessarily play an important role .",
    "but our limited knowledge about the nonperturbative qcd leads to a theoretical uncertainty in the quark- antiquark potential at large and intermediate distances @xcite .",
    "so a successful theoretical model can provide important information about the quark - antiquark interactions and the behavior of qcd at the hadronic scale . though there exist many potential models with relativistic and nonrelativistic considerations employed to study the hadron properties based on its quark structure @xcite ,",
    "the most commonly used potential is the coulomb plus linear power potential , @xmath19 , with the string tension @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "however , for the higher excited mesonic states it is argued that the string tension @xmath20 must depend on the @xmath21 separation @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to flattening of the confinement potential at larger @xmath22 @xmath23 .",
    "more over the analysis based on regge trajectories for meson states suggests the confinement part of the potential to have the power @xmath24 instead of 1 @xcite .",
    "this has prompted us to choose a power form for the confining part of the interquark potential and study the properties of heavy flavour systems by varying the power of the confinement part of the interquark potential different from 1.0 .",
    "+ apart from the spectroscopic predictions of higher orbital states , other problems associated with the phenomenological models employed for the properties of mesons are the right predictions of their decay properties . for better predictions of the decay widths ,",
    "many models need to incorporate additional terms such as the radiative contributions , higher order qcd corrections @xmath8 , to the conventional decay formula @xcite .",
    "+ the decay widths can provide an account of the compactness of the meson system in terms of the radial wave function which is an useful information complementary to spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "other unresolved issues are related to the hyperfine and fine structure splitting of the mesonic states and their intricate dependence with the constituent quark masses and the running strong coupling constant .",
    "thus , in this paper we make an attempt to study properties like mass spectrum , decay constants and other decay properties of the open charm mesons ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "we investigate the heavy - light mass spectra of @xmath26 and @xmath27 mesons in the frame work of the nonrelativistic cpp@xmath28 potential model . in the present study",
    ", we consider different choices of the potential power index @xmath3 in the range @xmath29 .",
    "in general , properties of heavy flavour mesons have been studied based on potential models in the frame work of relativistic as well as nonrelativistic quantum mechanics . in the limit of heavy quark mass @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 ,",
    "heavy meson properties are governed by the dynamics of the light quark . as such",
    ", these states become hydrogen like atoms of hadron physics . moreover , both the non - relativistic predictions are in fair agreements with each other as well as with the available experimental and lattice results . hence , for the present study of charm meson bound states , we consider a nonrelativistic hamiltonian given by @xcite @xmath33 here , @xmath34 [ eq : mmhh ] the relative momentum of each quark is represented by @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the quark - antiquark potential .",
    "nonrelativistically , this interaction potential consists of a central term @xmath37 and a spin dependent part @xmath38 .",
    "the central part @xmath37 is expressed in terms of a vector ( coulomb ) plus a scalar ( confining ) part given by @xmath39 as the static quark - antiquark interaction potential @xcite .     with the potential index @xmath3 for @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons .",
    ", width=480,height=384 ]      in general , the quark - antiquark bound states are represented by @xmath40 , identified with the @xmath41 values , with @xmath42 , @xmath43 , parity @xmath44 and the charge conjugation @xmath45 with @xmath46 being the radial quantum numbers .",
    "so the @xmath5-wave @xmath47 bound states are represented by @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively .",
    "the @xmath6-wave @xmath50 states are represented by @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 while @xmath54 and @xmath55 correspond to @xmath52 and @xmath56 respectively .",
    "thus , the spin - spin interaction among the constituent quarks provides the mass splitting of @xmath57 and @xmath49 states , while the spin - orbit interaction provides the mass splitting of @xmath54 and @xmath55 states .",
    "the @xmath58 state with @xmath52 and @xmath53 represents the spin average mass of the @xmath6-state as its spin - orbit contribution becomes zero , while the two @xmath59 singlet and the @xmath60 of the triplet @xmath6-states can form a mixed state .",
    "the @xmath0-wave @xmath61 states are represented by @xmath62 with @xmath63 and @xmath53 while @xmath64 and @xmath49 correspond to @xmath63 and @xmath56 respectively .",
    "the @xmath65-wave @xmath66 states are represented by @xmath67 with @xmath68 and @xmath53 while @xmath69 and @xmath55 correspond to @xmath68 and @xmath56 respectively .",
    "+   + for computing the mass difference between different degenerate meson states , we consider the spin dependent part of the usual one gluon exchange potential ( ogep ) given by @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the spin - dependent part , @xmath38 contains three components of the interaction terms , such as the spin - spin , the spin - orbit and the tensor part given by @xcite @xmath70 +                            v_{ls}(r)\\left(\\vec{l}\\cdot\\vec{s}\\right)+\\cr                 & & v_{t}(r ) \\left[s ( s+1)-\\frac{3(\\vec{s}\\cdot\\vec{r})(\\vec{s}\\cdot\\vec{r})}{r^2}\\right ]                \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the spin - orbit term containing @xmath71 and the tensor term containing @xmath72 describe the fine structure of the meson states , while the spin - spin term containing @xmath73 proportional to @xmath74 gives the spin singlet - triplet hyperfine splitting .",
    "+   + the coefficient of these spin - dependent terms of eqn.[spin ] can be written in terms of the vector and scalar parts of the static potential , @xmath37 as @xcite @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 the present study with the choices of @xmath3 in the range @xmath78 is an attempt to know the predictability of the hadron spectroscopy with a chosen value of mass parameters @xmath79 and confinements strength represented by the potential parameter @xmath80 .",
    "the running strong coupling constant appeared in the potential @xmath36 in turn is related to the quark mass parameter as @xmath81 where , @xmath82 is the number of flavors , @xmath83 is renormalization scale related to the constituent quark masses as @xmath84/@xmath85 and @xmath86 is the qcd scale which is taken as 0.150 gev by fixing @xmath87 at the @xmath88boson mass ( 91 ge@xmath89)@xcite .",
