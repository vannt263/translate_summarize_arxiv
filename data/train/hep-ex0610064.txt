    "although the standard model ( sm ) explains the results of the particle physics experiments performed up to now with an accuracy high enough to withstand even the challenges set by the precision measurements , it still leaves some of the basic questions open . the number of elementary particles , the reason for their mass hierarchy , and the unification of gravity with the other known forces are some examples of these open issues .",
    "the grand unified theories ( guts ) aim to answer at least some of these questions by imposing a fundamental symmetry between all known fermions of the same family .",
    "this symmetry , manifesting itself at high energies , is expected to reduce the number of free parameters in the sm .",
    "the experimental implication of extending the existing @xmath7 group structure of the sm to a single gauge group with a large fundamental representation is the prediction of new particles .",
    "the exceptional lie group @xmath1 has been long considered as one of the favorite candidates for such a gut gauge symmetry group @xcite .",
    "the new colored particles predicted by @xmath1 are isosinglet quarks , leptoquarks and diquarks depending on model variations . some of these particles may soon be accessible by the lhc experiments @xcite .",
    "the current limit on the mass of the down type isosinglet quark is @xmath8gev @xcite.the upgraded tevatron could reach @xmath9 gev @xcite , whereas the lhc will cover the region up to @xmath10 tev for the pair production channel @xcite independent of the mixing between @xmath11 and @xmath0 quarks . for the single production channel ,",
    "if the sine of the mixing angle exceeds 0.025 , the discovery reach would be @xmath12 tev @xcite . in this note , we consider the possible impact of the mixing between the @xmath1 isosinglet quark and the sm down type quarks on the light higgs boson @xmath13 ( e.g. @xmath14135 gev ) searches with the atlas detector @xcite .",
    "according to the atlas technical design report @xcite , for such a light higgs boson , the @xmath15 channel is the only one that would give a possible discovery with more than 5 @xmath16 significance with 100 fb@xmath17 of integrated luminosity .",
    "however , if the @xmath1 model is true and the mass of the lightest additional quark is suitable , its decays involving the higgs boson enhance the higgs discovery potential . in particular the channel studied in this note , @xmath18 , becomes as efficient as the @xmath5 channel for discovering the higgs particle if @xmath6 gev .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : the - higgs - interaction ] contains the description of the model and the new interactions involving the higgs particle .",
    "section [ sec : the - experimental - implications ] briefly discusses the outcomes of the new interaction : a ) the possibility of differentiation between the quarks of this model and any other model with an additional down type quark and b ) an increase in the higgs production rate at the lhc .",
    "section [ sec : detection - technique ] elaborates on the second outcome by describing the performed monte carlo ( mc ) studies based on a fast simulation of the atlas detector response .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes the statistical analysis that estimates the experimental reach to discover a light higgs for the early days of the lhc .",
    "if the sm @xmath7 group structure originates from the breaking of the @xmath1 gut scale down to the electroweak scale , then the extended quark sector should be written as :    @xmath19    as shown , each sm family is extended by the addition of an isosinglet quark , respectively denoted by the letters @xmath0 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "the mixing between the new and the sm down type quarks is responsible for the decays of the former . in this study ,",
    "the intra - family mixing of the new quarks is assumed to be dominant compared to their inter - family mixing . considering a similar mass hierarchy between the sm and the new quarks , the @xmath0 ( @xmath21 ) quark",
    "is assumed to be the lightest ( heaviest ) one .",
    "the lagrangian relevant for the @xmath0 quark weak interactions is :    @xmath22w^{\\alpha}\\label{lagrangian}\\\\   & - & \\frac{\\sqrt{4\\pi\\alpha_{em}}}{4\\sin\\theta_{w}}\\left[\\frac{\\sin\\phi\\cos\\phi}{\\cos\\theta_{w}}\\bar{d}\\gamma_{\\alpha}\\left(1-\\gamma_{5}\\right)d\\right]z^{\\alpha}\\nonumber \\\\   & - & \\frac{\\sqrt{4\\pi\\alpha_{em}}}{12\\cos\\theta_{w}\\sin\\theta_{w}}\\left[\\bar{d}\\gamma_{\\alpha}\\left(4\\sin^{2}\\theta_{w}-3\\sin^{2}\\phi(1-\\gamma_{5})\\right)d+\\bar{d}\\gamma_{\\alpha}\\left(4\\sin^{2}\\theta_{w}-3\\cos^{2}\\phi(1-\\gamma_{5})\\right)d\\right]z^{\\alpha}\\;+h.c.\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 is the mixing angle between the @xmath11 and @xmath0 quarks , and @xmath24 represents the usual ckm quark mixings , taken to be in the up sector for simplicity of calculation . assuming that the squared sum of the row elements of the new 3 4 ckm matrix gives unity , the measured values of @xmath25,@xmath26 , and @xmath27 @xcite constrain @xmath28 @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "the total decay width and the contribution from neutral and charged currents were already estimated in @xcite . as reported in that work",
    ", the @xmath0 quark decays through a @xmath30 boson with a branching ratio of 67% and through a @xmath31 boson with a branching ratio of 33% .",
    "the origin of the masses of sm particles is explained by using the higgs mechanism .",
    "the higgs mechanism can also be preserved in @xmath1 group structure as an effective theory , although other alternatives such as dynamical symmetry breaking are also proposed @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the origin of the mass of the new quarks ( @xmath32 ) should be due to another mechanism since these are isosinglets .",
    "therefore , the mass terms in the lagrangian , written in the mass basis , are simply:@xmath33    where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the masses of the @xmath11 and @xmath0 quarks respectively .",
    "based on this initial consideration , the studies in @xcite did not consider the channels involving the higgs boson @xmath13 for the @xmath0 quark decays .",
    "however , the mixing between @xmath11 and @xmath0 quarks will lead to decays of the latter involving @xmath13 after spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) . to find these decay channels ,",
    "the interaction between the higgs field and both down type quarks of the first family should be considered before ssb . in this study ,",
    "the lagrangian in sm basis , containing also the cross terms between @xmath11 and @xmath0 with mass - like coefficients ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) , is written as :    @xmath38    the four interaction coefficients ( @xmath39 ) in equation ( [ eq : main ] ) can be obtained in terms of the two quark masses and the two mixing angles between the left and right components of the two down type quarks . in order to use the new variable set , the first step is to write the mixing between the sm and the mass states as follows :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the @xmath11-@xmath0 quark mixing angle with the subscript l ( r ) standing for the left ( right ) components of the quark fields and the superscript 0 ( m ) standing for the sm ( mass ) basis . after the ssb",
    ", the higgs field is expanded around the new minimum , @xmath42 , as @xmath43 to separate the terms that contribute to interaction and mass coefficients :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 and @xmath46 gev is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field .",
    "after simple calculations , the lagrangian for the interaction between @xmath47 quarks , and the higgs boson becomes :    @xmath48\\ , d^{m}\\ , h\\nonumber \\\\   & - & \\frac{{\\sin{\\phi_{l}}\\cos{\\phi_{l}}}}{2\\nu}\\bar{{d}}^{m}\\left[(1+\\gamma^{5})\\ , m_{d}+(1-\\gamma^{5})\\ , m_{d}\\right]\\ , d^{m}\\ , h\\nonumber \\\\   & + & \\frac{m_{d}}{\\nu}\\cos^{2}\\phi_{l}\\bar{d}^{m}d^{m}h\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that the right mixing angle has completely disappeared from the final formula ( [ eq : ddh ] ) .",
    "the total width of the @xmath0 quark as a function of its mass is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : the - decay - width ] for the illustrative value of @xmath49 .",
    "it is seen that the @xmath0  quark has a narrow width and becomes even narrower with decreasing values of @xmath23 since it scales through a @xmath50 dependence .",
    "the relative branching ratios for the decay of the @xmath0  quark depend on both the @xmath0  quark and the higgs mass values .",
    "for example , at the values of @xmath0  quark mass around 200  gev and the higgs mass around 120@xmath51gev : br(@xmath52)@xmath5360% , br(@xmath54)@xmath5312% , br(@xmath55)@xmath5328% , whereas as the @xmath0  quark mass increases the same ratios asymptotically reach 50% , 25% and 25% respectively . as the higgs mass increases from 120  gev",
    ", these limit values are reached at higher @xmath0  quark masses .",
    "the branching ratios as a function of the @xmath0  quark mass are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : the - d - quark - br ] for two values of the higgs mass : 120  gev ( solid lines ) , which is just above the limit imposed by lep ii results , and 135  gev ( dashed lines ) , where the @xmath56 decay mode is taken over by the @xmath57mode .",
    "quark for @xmath49 : the lower curve corresponds to the case without higgs interaction , whereas the upper curve has been calculated by taking into account the higgs channels for @xmath58 gev .[fig : the - decay - width ] ]    ]",
    "studies about the @xmath0  quark pair production without the higgs particle have been previously reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "this section concentrates on the possible impact of the interactions involving the higgs particle .",
    "for example , equation ( [ eq : ddh ] ) shows that , the higgs boson could be used in the @xmath59 channel for the creation of @xmath60 quark pairs : @xmath61 or @xmath62 .",
    "however , as the higgs couplings depend on the quark masses , the right handed @xmath0 quarks ( @xmath63 ) would be produced @xmath64 times more often than the left handed ones ( @xmath65 ) . due to the left handedness of the charged weak interactions ,",
    "the produced @xmath0 quarks would subsequently decay mostly via the neutral current channel .",
    "the precise measurement of such a process could help in differentiating the @xmath1 model from other models that also involve additional down type quarks .",
    "depending on the masses of the @xmath0 quark and the higgs boson itself , the @xmath1 model could also boost the overall higgs production at the lhc .",
    "this boost is particularly interesting for the higgs hunt , one of the main goals of the atlas experiment .",
    "for example , if the @xmath0  quark mass is as low as 250  gev , its pair production cross section at the lhc becomes as high as @xmath66 fb as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : d - pair - prod ] .",
    "convolution of the cross section with the @xmath0  quark decay branching ratios from previous section ( 17% for @xmath67 at m@xmath68=250 gev ) yields the number of expected higgs events . in the low mass range considered in this note ( from 115 up to 135  gev ) , the branching ratio @xmath69 is about 70% @xcite .",
    "the signatures of the expected final states involving at least one higgs boson are listed in table [ tab : expected - final - states ] together with the yearly expected number of events for two example @xmath0 quark masses : 250 and 500 gev . for the remaining of this note ,",
    "although the case involving the @xmath31 is more suitable from the event reconstruction point of view , we will concentrate on the last row , which has the highest number of expected higgs events per year .",

    "this work gives the lagrangian for the @xmath0 quark including its interaction with the known sm particles and higgs boson .",
    "one of the two implications of the higgs interaction is discussed in detail : the boost to the higgs discovery potential at the lhc .",
    "it is shown that the atlas experiment can use the @xmath0 quark decay channels to enhance the higgs discovery potential independent of the mixing angle between @xmath11 and @xmath0 quarks .",
    "the prospects for the higgs discovery are discussed using monte carlo and fast simulation techniques for a light higgs particle ( 120 gev ) and some exemplary @xmath0 quark mass values ranging from 250 to 1000 gev .",
    "[ fig : reach ] contains the 3@xmath16 ( dashed lines ) and the 5 @xmath16 ( solid lines ) reaches of higgs boson ( triangles ) and @xmath0 quark ( circles ) searches for the above mentioned values .",
    "therefore , a light higgs boson could be discovered with a 5@xmath16 statistical significance using the @xmath71 channel within the first year of low luminosity data taking ( integrated luminosity of 10 fb@xmath17 ) if @xmath72 gev . under the same conditions but with one year of design luminosity ( integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath73",
    ", the 5 @xmath16 higgs discovery can be reached if @xmath74 gev .",
    "this is to be compared with the studies from the atlas tdr , where the most efficient channel to discover such a light higgs is the @xmath15 decay .",
    "this search yields about 8@xmath16 signal significance with 100 fb@xmath17 integrated luminosity",
    ". the presently discussed model could give the same significance ( or more ) with the same integrated luminosity if @xmath6 gev .",
    "therefore , if the isosinglet quarks exist and their masses are suitable , they will provide a considerable improvement for the higgs discovery potential .",
    "the same channel also provides the possibility to search for the lightest of the isosinglet quarks , providing a @xmath75 discovery signal if @xmath76 gev , within 100 fb@xmath17 of integrated luminosity .",
