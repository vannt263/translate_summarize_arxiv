    "we study the zero - temperature stochastic ising model in a finite hypercube of side - length @xmath2 in @xmath6 with plus boundary condition .",
    "initially , the whole cube is filled with minus spins .",
    "the spins evolve following the majority rule : with rate one each spin takes the same value as the majority of its neighbors ( including those at the boundary ) if the latter is well defined .",
    "otherwise its sign is determined by tossing a fair coin . eventually ,",
    "all minus spins disappear , as a result of the pressure imposed by plus spins from the boundary .",
    "our aim is to study the time @xmath1 needed for the spins in the hypercube to become entirely plus . according to a heuristics from lifshitz @xcite , on a macroscopic scale ,",
    "each point of the rescaled interface between plus and minus spins should move feeling a local drift proportional to its local mean curvature ( this conjecture has been recently proved with co - authors for the zero - temperature two - dimensional case with macroscopically convex initial domain of @xmath7 spins : see @xcite ) .",
    "this readily implies that , with high probability , @xmath5 .    here",
    "we prove that , with high probability , @xmath8 for all dimension @xmath0 .",
    "our result complements existing analogous bounds for dimension @xmath9 and @xmath10 obtained in @xcite .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the cases @xmath9 and @xmath10 are completely different , mainly because the equilibrium fluctuations of ising interfaces in @xmath9 and in @xmath10 occur on very different scales ( @xmath11 for @xmath9 and @xmath12 for @xmath10 ) . as such",
    ", they have been analyzed by using very different approaches .",
    "the case @xmath0 should be more similar to the case @xmath10 , which therefore plays the role of a critical dimension .",
    "however , contrary to what has been done in @xcite , our proof does not attempt to control the local mean drift of the interface . such an approach , in fact , would at least require two main missing tools : ( i ) a detailed analysis of the local equilibrium fluctuations of ising interfaces the fluctuations of ising hyper - surfaces are believed to be order one . recently",
    "a result of this sort has been proved under a lifshitz condition @xcite . ] ; ( ii ) good estimates on mixing times for @xmath13-monotone surfaces , following e.g.  the method developed by wilson @xcite for the three - dimensional case .",
    "instead , we use an ad - hoc construction that allows us to bound the hitting time @xmath1 for the @xmath14-dimensional dynamics using known sharp estimates for the same hitting time in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "one of the reasons why this approach is successful is that in dimension three , ising interfaces are flat with only logarithmic fluctuations ( see e.g.  proposition 4 in @xcite for more details ) .",
    "lifshitz s law is a general prediction for the mixing - time of the stochastic ising model in the whole low - temperature phase and not only for the zero - temperature version presented here .",
    "however , rigorous results available at positive temperature ( especially concerning the upper - bound ) are still very far from it .",

    "we fix @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( for some small @xmath85 ) .",

    "any improvement on this bound would be of interest .",

    "our dynamics enjoys nice monotonicity properties with respect to this order .",

    "this can be proved by constructing a coupling of the two processes @xmath31 and @xmath104 , building the two processes as explained in remark [ constru ] , with the same realization of @xmath46 and @xmath105 for both . with this coupling one",

    "a simple consequence of this monotonicity property is that to prove our main theorem , we just need to prove it with initial configuration all @xmath7 .",
    "this monotonicity of the dynamics is crucial for our proof as it allows us to use an explicit strategy to control the evolution of the set of @xmath7 ( see proposition [ maintool ] below ) .      from now on ,",
    "we focus on the case @xmath74 .",
    "we show at the end of the paper how to adapt the proof for arbitrary dimension @xmath14 .    the first tool of the proof is to perform surgical changes on the original dynamics that cancels some of the spin - flips from @xmath7 to @xmath22 .",
    "due to the above mentioned monotonicity properties , this slows down the dynamics and makes the mixing time longer ( which is alright to get an upper - bound ) , but if these changes are done carefully , this can also guide the dynamic in a nice pattern which allows us to have a better control on it .",
    "we choose carefully our modifications so that the dynamics we obtained is mostly a product of three - dimensional dynamics .",

    "then we use some ingredients borrowed from @xcite to control the evolution of each slice . in order to do this without slowing down the dynamics too much one needs an _ ad - hoc _ geometrical construction that we present at the end of this section . in order to make the reader more aware of this need",
    ", one exposes first a naive and non - optimal strategy that yields consequently a non - optimal bound .      a simple way to control the dynamics in to make the successive three - dimensional layers of our four - dimensional cube evolve one after the other .",

    "the main reason why the strategy of the previous section does not give a sharp bound is that the evolution of the modified dynamics is very far from the predicted motion by mean curvature .",

    "was obtained by a careful analysis of the fluctuations at equilibrium and the mixing time for monotone surfaces .",
    "a monotone surface is the graph of a function taking integer values , defined on a connected set @xmath186 and that is monotone with respect to both coordinate in @xmath187 ( this notion can be extended to any dimension ) .",
    "the reason why dimension @xmath16 allows to get the result for higher dimension is that fluctuation of monotone surface have low amplitude ( order @xmath188 for surfaces of side length @xmath2 ) , and the reason is the following : if we want the dynamic on the different slices of @xmath183 not to interact between one another , one want to put the @xmath189 interfaces of successive slices at a distance strictly larger than the typical interface fluctuation .",
    "this is the reason for the particular construction of the sets @xmath160 .",
    "this forces us to consider dynamics on a set @xmath183 that has diameter @xmath190 instead of @xmath2 , but the consequence of this is just the loss of some extra @xmath188 factors in the result .    in dimension @xmath15 ,",
    "fluctuations of monotone interfaces are too large ( of order @xmath191 for surfaces of side length @xmath2 ) to make a similar construction efficient ( in particular one * could not * have proved the main result in @xcite for @xmath10 by using only estimates for the two dimensional model ) . in dimension @xmath75 and more , fluctuations at equilibrium of monotone hyper - surfaces are believed to be smaller ( _ i.e. _ analogy with gaussian free field , one predicts that the mean fluctuations are of order @xmath33 ) but tools that we have in dimension @xmath16 ( one - to - one mapping with dimer models , determinantal representation ) are not available to compute them , and therefore the method of @xcite can not be applied .",
    "our proof of proposition [ maintool ] , which is the core of this note , uses repeatedly a variant of proposition 3 from @xcite that we state below .",

    "one can then check that the latter dynamics corresponds ( up to a trivial bijection ) to the ( three - dimensional ) dynamics on @xmath242 with @xmath22 boundary condition .",

    "once one has noticed this , the case @xmath124 is an immediate consequence of corollary [ ndg ] ( without the restriction of having spin blocked inside the inner - sphere ) .    for the induction step",

    "so we introduce an auxiliary dynamics @xmath214 , that coincides with @xmath248 up to time @xmath249 and which for @xmath250 uses the same clock process and the same coin - flips ( see remark [ constru ] ) as @xmath251 but cancels the moves that create a @xmath7 outside of @xmath160 .",
