    "the kp equation is widely considered as the paradigm of soliton equations .",
    "the main results of soliton theory , including first and foremost the celebrated sato theory , were discovered in the study of this equation .",
    "the discovery of the vertex operator , which maps @xmath0-soliton solutions to @xmath1-soliton ones , figures prominently among these results .",
    "the discrete kp equation ( or hirota - miwa equation ) , which is a discretized version of the kp equation , is also regarded as a fundamental discrete soliton equation . by restricting its solutions it reduces to",
    "many well - known discrete soliton equations as , for example , the discrete kdv equation or the discrete toda equation .",
    "soliton cellular automata form a class of cellular automata that exhibit soliton - like behaviour and possess a rich structure including the existence of explicit @xmath0-soliton solutions and an infinite amount of conserved quantities @xcite , like most ordinary soliton equations .",
    "the  box and ball system \" ( bbs ) @xcite is the main representative of this class .",
    "it is related to the discrete soliton equations , through a limiting procedure called  ultradiscretization \" @xcite .",
    "the non - autonomous ultradiscrete kp equation is obtained by ultradiscretizing the non - autonomous discrete kp equation @xcite .",
    "tokohiro presented its @xmath0-soliton solution and described the dynamics of the bbs with several kinds of balls in @xcite .",
    "shinzawa and hirota discussed the consistency conditions of the bcklund transformation for the autonomous ultradiscrete kp equation in @xcite .",
    "recently , these systems draw increasing interest due to the establishment of relationships to other mathematical topics , for example , to algebraic geometry and representation theory",
    ". it is therefore fruitful to clarify the symmetries and the algebraic structure of ultradiscrete soliton equations , as was done for the continuous ones .",
    "takahashi and hirota presented an approach based on so - called  permanent type solutions \" @xcite ( which are expressed as signature - free casorati determinants ) to discuss particular solutions of ultradiscrete systems .",
    "nagai presented identities for permanent type solutions , which can be considered as ultradiscrete analogues of plcker relations for determinants in @xcite . another approach for obtaining solutions is the vertex operator for the ultradiscrete kdv equation , which is proposed by the author in @xcite .",
    "this approach is believed to be closely related to certain types of symmetries for this system .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a vertex operator for the non - autonomous ultradiscrete kp equation and various ultradiscrete soliton equations obtained by reduction . in section 2",
    "we first propose a recursive representation of the soliton solutions of the non - autonomous ultradiscrete kp equation . in section 3 , we propose the vertex operator as an operator representation of the recursive one . in section 4 , we present various reductions of this equation and discuss their vertex operators and solutions . finally , in section 5 , we give some concluding remarks .",
    "the non - autonomous ultradiscrete kp equation is written as @xmath2 where @xmath3 depends only on @xmath4 .",
    "[ thm1 ] the function @xmath5 expressed as @xmath6 solves equation ( [ bilinear ] ) for @xmath7 given by @xmath8 here , @xmath9 stands for @xmath10 and the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 satisfy the relations : @xmath13    [ lem1 ] let @xmath14 for @xmath15 such that @xmath16 then it holds that @xmath17    by employing the inequality @xmath18 we obtain @xmath19 @xmath20 adding the inequalities yields @xmath21 taking into account the relations @xmath22 , it can be shown inductively that the four arguments in this maximum are all less than @xmath23 .",
    "[ lem2 ] let @xmath24 one then has @xmath25 when one requires that the @xmath26 are solutions of ( [ bilinear ] ) . especially for @xmath27 ,",
    "the inequality ( [ lem2ineq ] ) becomes an equality , i.e. : @xmath28 .",
    "when @xmath29 , we obtain by virtue of the inequality ( [ maxtrineq ] ) : @xmath30 however , @xmath31 because @xmath32 satisfies ( [ bilinear ] ) .",
    "it can then be shown inductively that all arguments in the maximum are less than @xmath33 .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath27 , by virtue of ( [ condq ] ) , @xmath34 is equal to @xmath35 for all @xmath36 because @xmath37 for all @xmath38 .",
    "we thus obtain that @xmath39    [ lem3 ] let @xmath40 one then has @xmath41 when all of @xmath26 are solutions of ( [ bilinear ] ) .",
    "the proof is essentially the same as that of lemma [ lem2 ] when @xmath42 .",
    "we now have all the necessary lemmas at our disposal and proceed to the proof of theorem [ thm1 ] .",
    "we shall prove the theorem inductively .",
    "it is clear that @xmath43 solves equation ( [ bilinear ] ) because of the non - negativity of @xmath44 .",
    "now , let us assume that the theorem holds at @xmath45 . by substituting ( [ exformula ] ) in equation ( [ bilinear ] )",
    ", each contribution can be written as @xmath46 for the left hand side of ( [ bilinear ] ) , and @xmath47 for the right hand side . in these expressions",
    "it looks as if each of the maximum operations in ( [ ff1])([ff3 ] ) has four arguments .",
    "however , by virtue of lemma [ lem1 ] , the third argument in ( [ ff1 ] ) and ( [ ff2 ] ) can not yield the maximum because it is always less than the second argument .",
    "then , the relevant arguments of the maximum in ( [ ff1 ] ) are in fact @xmath48 and those in the maximum of the contributions in ( [ ff2 ] ) , ( [ ff3 ] ) , as they appear in the right hand side of equation ( [ bilinear ] ) : @xmath49 here , ( [ lhs1 ] ) and ( [ lhs3 ] ) are identical to ( [ rhs1 ] ) and ( [ rhs4 ] ) because by assumption , @xmath50 solves the equation ( [ bilinear ] ) .    by subtracting ( [ lhs2 ] ) from ( [ rhs2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath51 the third argument of this maximum is non - positive by virtue of lemma [ lem3 ] .    in the case",
    "@xmath52 , @xmath53 has to be equal to @xmath54 due to condition ( [ condq ] ) .",
    "then , the first argument in ( [ mid1 ] ) is also non - positive and the second argument is @xmath55 , due to lemma [ lem2 ] .    in the case",
    "@xmath56 , the first argument in the maximum in ( [ mid1 ] ) is @xmath55 and the second argument is non - positive by virtue of lemma [ lem2 ] .",
    "thus , ( [ mid1 ] ) is equal to @xmath55 , in all possible cases ( i.e. , @xmath57 or @xmath58 ) .",
    "we have therefore shown that all arguments of the maximum in ( [ ff1 ] ) which constitutes the left hand side of ( [ bilinear ] ) , have an equivalent counterpart among ( [ rhs1 ] ) , ( [ rhs2 ] ) , ( [ rhs4 ] ) , i.e. among the three arguments that contribute to the right hand side of ( [ bilinear ] ) .",
    "hence , ( [ bilinear ] ) is satisfied .",
    "please note that the proof allows for the possibility that , at different values of @xmath4 , @xmath59 satisfies different equalities ( @xmath60 or @xmath61 for different @xmath4 ) , because the shift of the independent variables induced by ( [ exformula ] ) affects only @xmath62 and @xmath63 , not @xmath4 .",
    "in this section we propose an alternative representation of the @xmath0-soliton solutions , generated by a vertex operator @xmath64 .",
    "the @xmath55-soliton solution @xmath65 is written as : @xmath66 whereas the @xmath1-soliton solution is generated from the @xmath0-soliton solution @xmath67 ( written as @xmath68 for brevity ) by @xmath69 where the parameters @xmath70 in the vertex operator @xmath64 must satisfy @xmath71 the phase factor @xmath72 is the same as in ( [ defeta ] ) , and the interaction terms @xmath73 are @xmath74    [ sym ] the action of the operator @xmath64 is commutative .    by calculating @xmath75 directly ,",
    "we obtain @xmath76 from this relation it is clear that interchanging the subscripts @xmath77 and @xmath78 does not change the overall value of the maximum .",
    "@xmath79    rewriting this proposition yields the following corollary :    [ cor1 ] the @xmath0-soliton solution @xmath68 is invariant under the permutation of its parameters , i.e. : @xmath80    by virtue of corollary [ cor1 ] , we can fix the labels of the parameters as in ( [ condp ] ) , ( [ condq ] ) without loss of generality . by virtue of this ordering , the phase shifts in @xmath81 in the definition ( [ symexformula ] ) simplify to @xmath82 it should be noted that the phase shifts @xmath83 and @xmath84 are equivalent to shifts on the independent variables @xmath85 and @xmath86 , which shows that @xmath68 is equivalent to @xmath5 .",
    "in this section we present some examples of reductions of the ultradiscrete kp equation to @xmath87 dimensional ultradiscrete equations and we give the vertex operators for these equations .      by restricting @xmath88 to @xmath89 and denoting",
    "@xmath90 and @xmath91 , the non - autonomous ultradiscrete kp equation ( [ bilinear ] ) is reduced to the so - called non - autonomous ultradiscrete hungry kdv equation : @xmath92 by means of the dependent variable transformation @xmath93 and denoting @xmath94 , ( [ uhkdvbilinear ] ) is transformed into @xmath95 which describes the dynamics of a box and ball system with @xmath96 kinds of balls , as presented in @xcite .",
    "this system is required to satisfy the following boundary conditions : @xmath97 in particular , in the case of @xmath98 it reduces to an extension of the standard bbs @xcite , with variable size of boxes at each site .    in our representation ( [ symexformula ] ) ,",
    "the reduction ( [ redhkdv ] ) is equivalent to the parameter restriction : @xmath99 it should be noted that our representation satisfies the boundary condition ( [ bchkdv ] ) because the first argument of @xmath100 in ( [ symexformula ] ) is never chosen for sufficiently small @xmath101 .",
    "then , the vertex operator for ( [ uhkdvbilinear ] ) can be written as @xmath102 where the phase factor @xmath72 is @xmath103 and @xmath104 and the interaction terms @xmath81 are expressed as @xmath105      by restricting @xmath88 to @xmath106 @xmath107 and denoting @xmath108 and @xmath109 , ( [ bilinear ] ) is reduced to the ultradiscrete toda equation : @xmath110 by means of the dependent variable transformation @xmath111 ( [ utodabilinear ] ) is transformed into @xmath112 which describes the dynamics of the toda type cellular automaton presented in @xcite .    in our representation ( [ symexformula ] ) ,",
    "the reduction ( [ redtoda ] ) is equivalent to the parameter restriction : @xmath113    the vertex operator of ( [ utodabilinear ] ) can be expressed as @xmath114 where the phase factor @xmath72 is @xmath115 and the interaction term @xmath81 is written as @xmath116",
    "in this paper , we proposed a recursive representation of the @xmath0-soliton solutions and vertex operators for the ultradiscrete kp equation .",
    "we also proposed expressions for various ultradiscrete equations , obtained by reduction from the kp equation .",
    "in fact , the vertex operator approach is closely related to the existence of certain symmetry algebras for integrable systems and the exact relation of our ultradiscrete operator to the symmetries of ultradiscrete systems is an especially interesting problem we want to address in the future .",
    "because it uses simple shift and @xmath100 operators and not the usual algebraic or combinatorial methods , our representation also has the potential to describe solutions different from the solitonic ones .",
    "it is an interesting problem to describe the full class of solutions these equations admit ."
