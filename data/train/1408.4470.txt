    "there exists an embedded closed minimal hypersurface  @xmath2 in  @xmath0 with a singular set of hausdorff dimension at most  @xmath3 such that @xmath4 where @xmath5 is an explicit positive constant depending only on  @xmath1 .    observe that both the ricci curvature condition and the inequality are scale invariant in this theorem .",
    "we do not know whether the curvature condition can be dropped in dimension greater than two . in dimension two ,",
    "it is the case according to  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  5.3.1 ) , @xcite and  @xcite : every closed riemannian surface has a closed geodesic of length bounded from above in terms of the area of the surface .",
    "thus , theorem  [ theo:0 ] can be viewed as a partial generalization of this result on closed geodesics on surfaces in terms of minimal hypersurfaces .",
    "another way to generalize this result would be to find an upper bound on the length of the shortest closed geodesic in a closed riemannian manifold in terms of the volume .",
    "except for essential manifolds , where systolic inequalities hold  @xcite , and the two - sphere  @xcite , this question is completely open , even on manifolds with nonnegative ricci curvature .",
    "the condition on the size of the singular set is customary in this context . to our knowledge , it is still unknown if there exists a closed _ smooth _ minimal hypersurface in every closed riemannian manifold even with nonnegative ricci curvature .",
    "the existence of a minimal hypersurface in theorem  [ theo:0 ] actually derives from a min - max principle due to almgren - pitts in geometric measure theory ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "when the ricci curvature is positive , the geometry of the min - max minimal hypersurface  @xmath2 has recently been described in  @xcite .",
    "in fact , theorem  [ theo:0 ] is a consequence of the following sweep - out estimate .",

    "there exists a pl morse function @xmath6 such that @xmath7 where @xmath5 is an explicit positive constant depending only on  @xmath1 .",
    "recall that a function @xmath6 is a pl morse function if there exists a simplicial complex structure on  @xmath0 such that @xmath8 is linear on every simplex of  @xmath0 and takes pairwise distinct values at the vertices of  @xmath0 .    as already mentioned , the sweep - out estimate of theorem  [ theo : a ] is stronger than theorem  [ theo:0 ] .",
    "a slightly more general version is given by theorem  [ theo : main ] .",
    "observe again that both the ricci curvature condition and the inequality are scale invariant .",
    "contrary to the previous theorem where the question is open , this result fails without any curvature condition for every closed @xmath1-manifold with  @xmath9 ( see  proposition  [ prop : cex ] ) .",
    "however , the curvature assumption can be dropped for closed riemannian surfaces  @xcite . in this case , the multiplicative constant depends on the genus of the surface ( and it has to ) .",
    "none of the multiplicative constants in theorems  [ theo:0 ] or  [ theo : a ] is optimal , even on two - dimensional convex spheres despite a local extremality result  @xcite . for positively curved @xmath10-manifolds ,",
    "related sharp upper bounds have been obtained in  @xcite .    when @xmath0 is a smooth convex hypersurface in a euclidean @xmath1-space , the result of theorem  [ theo : a ] follows from  @xcite .",
    "a similar result also holds true for domains of the euclidean @xmath1-space ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , our sweep - out estimate can be seen as a partial generalization of these results to a non - euclidean setting .",
    "actually , theorem  [ theo : a ] can be formulated in terms of a min - max estimate by taking the infimum over all pl morse functions of the supremum of the volume of their fibers .",
    "further consideration of min - max principles can be found in  @xcite .",
    "note that min - max processes are also involved in concentration phenomena .",
    "a related estimate holds for manifolds with nonnegative sectional curvature by replacing the volume of the fibers by the diameter ( see  @xcite ) .    as a consequence of our sweep - out estimate",
    ", we also derive the following isoperimetric inequality .",

    "( the most recent results mentioned below even appeared after this paper was submitted for publication . ) in  @xcite , t.  colding and w.  minicozzi established min - max estimates through the ricci flow which allowed them to simplify some arguments in perelman s proof of the poincar conjecture through a more conceptual approach . in  @xcite and  @xcite , the authors established genus bound for minimal surfaces constructed via min - max arguments on every closed riemannian @xmath10-manifold .",
    "recently , f.  marques and a.  neves proved the willmore conjecture  @xcite and a conjecture of yau about the existence of infinitely many minimal hypersurfaces in closed riemannian manifolds with positive ricci curvature  @xcite by using a min - max process  la almgren - pitts .",
