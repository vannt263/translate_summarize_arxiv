    "the initial - final mass relation ( ifmr ) for progenitors and white dwarfs is fundamental in understanding a stellar population , interpreting the white dwarf mass and luminosity distributions , and determining the star formation history .",
    "of particular interest is the upper mass limit of a star forming a white dwarf .",
    "it is well known that the mass loss in the red giant phases ( rgb and agb ) of stars of similar mass and chemical composition shows dispersion .",
    "the existence of `` horizontal branches '' in metal - poor and metal - rich clusters shows that varying amounts of the hydrogen envelope are lost in the rgb or helium - ignition events . for intermediate - mass stars undergoing agb evolution",
    ", the timing of thermal pulses of the helium shell may produce a dispersion in the resulting white dwarf distribution ( eg .",
    "iben & renzini 1983 ) .",
    "it may therefore be anticipated that the the ifmr will show dispersion .    in order to determine empirically the ifmr ,",
    "it is necessary to study samples of white dwarfs where it is possible to estimate the initial mass of the progenitor . since there is generally no way of establishing the total lifetimes of white dwarfs in the field population ,",
    "white dwarfs found in well - studied star clusters have been used .",
    "the cluster age is known within some uncertainty , generally from fits to the main sequence turnoff . in a few clusters , the mass limit below which lithium is not depleted in completely - convective low mass stars and/or brown dwarfs",
    "may also be employed .",
    "several galactic disk clusters ranging in age from of the order 10@xmath3 to 10@xmath4 years , and with main sequence turnoff masses of @xmath52 to @xmath65m@xmath2 , have been studied in recent years .",
    "these include the hyades and praesepe ( claver et al .",
    "2001 is the most recent study ) , the pleiades ( the single white dwarf has been studied by many authors ) , ngc  2516 ( koester & reimers 1996 ) , ngc  3532 ( koester & reimers 1993 ) , ngc  2168 ( williams , bolte & koester 2004 ) , and ngc  2099 ( kalirai et al .",
    "since it is necessary to measure the masses of the white dwarfs accurately  by means of stellar atmosphere fits to balmer lines or by measuring the gravitational redshift  the faint white dwarf sequences recently found in the nearest globular clusters ( cf .",
    "m  4 , hansen et al .",
    "2004 ) and in older galactic clusters ( ngc  6791 , bedin et al .",
    "2005 ) are not yet as useful .",
    "the upper end of the ifmr is yielding progenitors with short nuclear - burning phases , and these lifetimes are very dependent on the mass . for several reasons",
    ", there must be significant uncertainty in the estimations of the ages of such young clusters .",
    "first , these clusters do not necessarily have well - populated upper main sequences .",
    "shifts due to rotation , unresolved binaries , and the possible presence of blue stragglers with masses larger than the turnoff mass represent a separate category of problems .",
    "finally , uncertainty in the main sequence lifetime of stars with convective cores due to the probable overshooting beyond the simple schwarzschild boundary is a theoretical problem .",
    "thus the uncertainty in the cluster age causes a big uncertainty in the possible progenitor masses of white dwarfs , especially for the youngest clusters .",
    "these problems result in considerable uncertainty in establishing the upper mass limit of a star that can form a white dwarf , or even if such a uniform upper limit exists .",
    "it is thus extremely important if a method were available to reduce the spread in the progenitor s mass .",
    "binaries consisting of a nuclear - burning star and a white dwarf offer another potential source of candidates for the ifmr .",
    "if the parameters of the nuclear - burning star can be established with sufficient accuracy that its age can be obtained by fitting its position on the hr diagram , then the total age of the white dwarf  which is the sum of the nuclear - burning lifetime and cooling age  can also be established . as for the clusters ,",
    "the nuclear - burning lifetime is used to establish the progenitor mass of the white dwarf .",
    "the sirius system is the fifth or sixth nearest stellar system to the sun , and certainly is one of the best studied binary systems including a white dwarf component .",
    "one does not want to employ a white dwarf in a binary close enough that interactions might have affected the mass loss phases in the late stages of the progenitor s evolution .",
    "however , the orbit is eccentric with a period of about 50 years . at periastron ,",
    "the components are just within 7  au of each other ( van de kamp 1971 ) .",
    "this is probably well enough separated so that any interaction during the asymptotic giant branch phase of the original primary ( now b ) would have been minimal .",
    "significant interaction would probably have circularized the orbit .",
    "we therefore assume that sirius b evolved in a manner like that of a single star .",
    "an excellent trigonometric parallax , accurate to better than 1% , is available from the _ hipparcos _ satellite mission as well as from several good ground - based studies . using the bolometric energy distribution and effective temperature determination , the luminosity of sirius  a is known to about 4% accuracy . using the eso _ very large telescope interferometer _ , kervella et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have obtained a superb measurement of the diameter of sirius  a , accurate to about 0.75% .",
    "one may then avoid very direct use of the t@xmath7 estimates of sirius  a. robust parameter ( t@xmath7 , log  g ) determinations for sirius  b are also available from space observations . finally , a recent reexamination of the plethora of astrometric data on the binary orbit ( holberg 2005 ) results in mass estimates of both and `` a '' and `` b '' components accurate to 1 - 2% .",
    "improvements in opacities , the equation - of - state , and other treatments in modern stellar evolution codes now make possible fits to nuclear - burning stars on the hr diagram , especially those on or near the main sequence ( young & arnett 2005 ) .",
    "robust , consistent ages for ( nondegenerate ) binary stars with well - determined luminosities , masses , radii and temperature have been determined ( young et al . 2001 ) .    in section 2 of this paper",
    ", we employ this code to fit the position of sirius  a , and estimate the age with an error estimate .",
    "this gives the systemic age from which to subtract the cooling age of `` b '' in section 3 to obtain the estimate of its progenitor mass , and its uncertainty .",
    "we then summarize and discuss an important caveat in section 4 .",
    "the mass adopted for sirius  a is 2.02@xmath00.03m@xmath2 ( holberg 2005 ) . note that this new astrometric study yields a mass about 5% smaller than some earlier determinations of sirius  a. ( the smaller orbit also yields a smaller mass for sirius  b. ) the adopted radius of sirius  a is 1.711@xmath00.013  r@xmath2 ( kervella et al .",
    "2003 ) , and the resulting luminosity is l / l@xmath2 = 25.4@xmath01.3 . since the luminosity and radius are more directly measured than the t@xmath7 , these will be the quantities fitted in an @xmath8@xmath9 equivalent of the hr diagram .",
    "one issue with sirius  a is that it is a chemically - peculiar a1v dwarf , so that a direct determination of the interior chemical composition is not possible .",
    "however , it has been believed for a long time that sirius is a member of a large moving group near the sun , called the `` sirius supercluster '' ( hertzsprung 1909 ; eggen 1983 ) .",
    "( we reassess this issue in the last section of the paper , however . )",
    "the `` core '' of this association is the ursa major `` dipper '' stars .",
    "metallicity estimates for the group members ( that are not chemically - peculiar ) are generally consistent with solar ( palous & hauck 1986 ) .",
    "eggen ( 1992 ) compared the abundances of the sirius and hyades superclusters and concluded that the former is deficient by about -0.18 dex in [ fe / h ] compared with the hyades group .",
    "the latter is believed to exceed solar by about this amount .",
    "there is no guarantee that appreciable dispersion in metallicity does not exist among the group .",
    "we nonetheless can do no better than assume solar x , z values below .    however , a new solar abundance scale determined from 3d non - lte calculations of the solar atmosphere ( asplund et al .",
    "2004 , and references therein ) has significantly lower abundances of oxygen , carbon and nitrogen .",
    "the overall heavy elements abundance parameter for the sun decreases to a primordial value of z=0.014 .",
    "the new scale jeopardizes the excellent agreement of the `` standard solar model '' with the helioseismology observations ( bahcall et al .",
    "2005 ) , though a new study attempts to remedy this , retaining the asplund et al .",
    "values ( young & arnett 2005 ) .",
    "we have adopted the new scale for the calculations described below .    in figure  1",
    "are shown the results of running the tycho code ( young & arnett 2005 ) to fit the position of sirius  a. the model included wave - driven mixing and diffusion .",
    "the former is a way of accounting for the `` overshooting '' of the convective core based on physics , rather than a prescription involving the ratio of the mixing length to scale height .",
    "the microphysics for opacities , reaction rates and the eos appear numerically similar to those of ventura et al .",
    "the inclusion of these effects produces only a small effect at the best fit age of 237.5@xmath012.5 myr .",
    "radiative levitation was not included .",
    "a perfect fit would require a lower metallicity or an increase in mass of a few hundredths m@xmath2 .",
    "the evolution was begun well up the hayashi track and followed throughout the pre - main sequence .",
    "the best - fit age includes the pre - ms evolution .",
    "no pre - ms accretion was included",
    ". the best - fit age is constrained primarily by the radius determination .",
    "the precision with which the sirius - a radius and luminosity are known is such that the use of the new solar abundance scale matters greatly . in particular ,",
    "_ no reasonable fit can be achieved _ if the old scale ( grevesse & sauval 1998 ) were adopted .",
    "when the 2.02m@xmath2 track for the old solar scale crosses the correct radius on its main sequence track , the luminosity is log l / l@xmath2 = 1.26 , several sigma below the observed value .",
    "the new solar abundances result in lower interior opacities , so the star has a smaller radius at a given luminosity , and vice versa .",
    "another estimate of the radius of sirius  a is reported by decin et al . ( 2003 ) using the short wavelength spectrometer on the infrared space observatory .",
    "this measurement is far less precise , and the kervella et al .",
    "( 2003 ) angular diameter is within its 5% errors .",
    "an accurate t@xmath7 determination is also essential for measuring the cooling age of sirius  b. holberg et al .",
    "( 1998 ) employed space ultraviolet _ extreme ultraviolet explorer _ and _ international ultraviolet explorer _ spectrophotometry to estimate 24,790@xmath0100 .",
    "barstow et al s ( 2005 ) estimate , using an optical spectrum of extraordinarily high signal - to - noise ratio , obtained with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( _ stis _ ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ is 25,193@xmath037 ( an internal error only ) .",
    "we adopt t@xmath7 = 25,000@xmath0200 .",
    "the astrometric reanalysis of holberg ( 2005 ) results in a measurement of 1.00@xmath00.01m@xmath2 for the mass of sirius  b. barstow et al .",
    "( 2005 ) obtained t@xmath7 = 25,193  k ( as stated above ) and log  g = 8.528@xmath00.05 from fits to the balmer line profiles . in the next paragraphs",
    "we shall apply cooling sequences to obtain the cooling age of sirius b. these also yield a second relationship ( besides the surface gravity ) between the radius and mass  r = r(m , t@xmath7 ) . solving for",
    "the mass one obtains 0.978@xmath00.005m@xmath2 , if the cooling sequences of wood ( 1995 ) are used , or 0.003m@xmath2 less if the those of fontaine et al .",
    "( 2001 ) are employed . using their gravitational redshift measurement of 80.42@xmath04.83 km  s@xmath10  yielding the ratio m / r  with the wood sequences , barstow et al .",
    "( 2005 ) obtain 1.02@xmath00.02m@xmath2 .",
    "note that these mass determinations are generally below previous estimates in earlier literature . for this study",
    ", we shall adopt 1.00@xmath00.02m@xmath2 for sirius b.    for the cooling ages of white dwarfs , most cluster white dwarf studies in the last ten years have used the evolutionary models of wood ( 1992 , 1995 ) . for reasons stated below , we will use primarily a new sequence by fontaine , brassard , & bergeron ( 2001 ) . both calculations used",
    "50% carbon ",
    "50% oxygen cores , and the relatively thick outer layers of helium and hydrogen predicted by most evolutionary calculations of the asymptotic giant branch phase .",
    "the fontaine et al .",
    "calculations incorporate several new treatments of physics ( fontaine 2005 , private communication ) .",
    "first , the equation of state of saumon , chabrier , & van horn ( 1995 ) for h and he in the partially - ionized envelope , and a new treatment of carbon in the same regime , was employed .",
    "second , the conductive opacity tables of hubbard & lampe ( 1969 ) and itoh & kohyama ( 1993 , and references therein ) were `` fused together , '' rather than treated as completely separate .",
    "third , no discontinuities in the chemical composition profile are allowed .",
    "diffusion at the interfaces is calculated .",
    "fourth , a full stellar structure is evolved from the center to the top of the atmosphere , not a simple `` henyey '' core which excludes the envelope .",
    "fifth , a robust and accurate finite element technique ( developed by p. brassard ) is used , as opposed to finite differences as in most other codes .",
    "we thus have adopted these sequences to estimate the cooling age of sirius  b. having said this , it is interesting and reassuring that the 1.00  m@xmath2 c , o sequence of wood ( 2005 , private communication ) reaches a cooling age of 123.3 myr at 25,000  k , while the fontaine et al .",
    "( 2001 ) sequence with identical parameters reaches 123.6@xmath010  myr .",
    "error bars in the `` final '' mass of sirius  b are as stated above .",
    "the uncertainty in the mass and systemic age (   2 ) leads to a nuclear lifetime for the progenitor in the range of 101126 myr .    for determining the initial mass ,",
    "we consider errors due to ( 1 ) uncertainty in the final mass , and ( 2 ) uncertainty in the systemic age (    2 ) .",
    "we shall also consider a possible additional uncertainty due to the different results obtained from the tycho and `` padova '' codes , and an uncertainty due to the unknown carbon - oxygen abundance profiles throughout the core .",
    "for most recent papers on white dwarf sequences , such as ferrario et al .",
    "( 2005 , hereafter f05 ) , the `` padova '' stellar evolution models of girardi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) were used to get the nuclear lifetime and the initial progenitor mass . for this paper , for self - consistency with   2 , we present first the calculations of these using the tycho code .",
    "while tycho incorporates physical treatments available in 2005 ( rather than several years earlier for the `` padova '' literature calculations ) , the principal difference between the two results may be the treatment of mixing beyond the traditional schwarzschild core boundary .",
    "girardi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) use an `` overshoot '' prescription based on a single parameter . as alluded to in   2",
    ", tycho includes the effects of hydrodynamics in the convective boundary and radiative regions in a predictive , physically - motivated fashion .",
    "this treatment may give more accurate predictions of core sizes , and thus of luminosities , radii , and nuclear lifetimes .",
    "from the tycho calculations , the masses that bracket the above range in the progenitor s nuclear lifetime are 5.43 and 4.78  m@xmath2 , with a mean of 5.056m@xmath2 . the uncertainly in the cooling age ( due to that of the white dwarf mass ) contributes errors of only -0.171 and + 0.262m@xmath2 .",
    "the uncertainty in the age of the binary system contributes -0.213 and + 0.273m@xmath2 . when added in quadrature ,",
    "these values yield the mass range of the previous paragraph . if we employ instead the girardi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) tables , again for nuclear lifetimes of 101 myr and 126 myr , the mean value of initial mass is only slightly larger at 5.132@xmath11m@xmath2 .",
    "thus we may also conclude that the physical treatment of the convective boundary region by tycho , and the `` overshoot '' prescription of the padova group , agree pretty well near 5m@xmath2 . in any case",
    "the uncertainties in the initial mass from this analysis are smaller than for any massive cluster white dwarf included in f05 .",
    "an additional source of uncertainty in the cooling age not considered here is that due to the carbon ",
    "oxygen abundance distribution in the core .",
    "as stated previously , the white dwarf cooling calculations of fontaine et al .",
    "( 2001 ) simply employ a 50%50% mixture .",
    "the usual practice in the published analyses of the cluster white dwarfs is , as stated previously , to use wood s calculations with the same mixture .",
    "other available calculations from wood are for pure carbon and for pure oxygen compositions .",
    "the 5  m@xmath2 sequence calculated from tycho produces very nearly a 1m@xmath2 core at the end of the agb evolution , which suggests that the prescription for mass loss in the red giant phases is fairly accurate .",
    "the resulting white dwarf has a carbon abundance of 15% throughout the inner 0.45  @xmath12 , comprised of the former convective he - burning core .",
    "the carbon abundance increases from 35% to 40% moving outward through the region processed by he shell burning , with a narrow ( @xmath13 ) spike of 60% carbon where he burning is incomplete . at low",
    "he abundances the @xmath14 dependence of the triple @xmath15 reaction favors the @xmath16 reaction over triple @xmath15 .",
    "more massive cores with higher entropy favor the production of @xmath17 over @xmath18 .",
    "convective he burning cores also tend to grow at low @xmath19 due to increased opacity .",
    "this process as well as any non - convective mixing process which mixes he into the core at low abundance will increase the destruction of @xmath18 , resulting in an oxygen dominated core ( arnett 1996 ) .",
    "pure carbon white dwarf cooling models are thus excluded for this mass range , favoring a shorter cooling time .",
    "using the simple mixture is therefore the best choice of available cooling sequences , but the additional error to the cooling time due to not matching the true abundance profile is not well constrained .",
    "the result of this analysis is a spread in the possible progenitor mass of sirius  b generally smaller than those in the young clusters cited above . in a parallel f05 paper , sirius  b",
    "provides a valuable `` anchor point '' in the high mass part of the ifmr , which is plotted therein ( their fig .  1 ) .",
    "the conclusions as to the sirius  b progenitor mass obviously depend on the fit to the sirius  a luminosity and radius being a valid measure of the systemic age .",
    "the `` achilles heel '' of the analysis may be the assumption of solar composition for the primordial abundance of the two stars . since there is no way to measure directly the primordial abundance of either the chemically - peculiar a star or the white dwarf , we have relied on the assumption that it is a member of the sirius supercluster , and that these stars have generally been shown to have abundances indistinguishable from solar .",
    "it must be acknowledged that , in the recent study of king et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , it appears by no means certain that sirius ",
    "so distant from the ursa major core  is a member of the sirius supercluster .",
    "these authors estimate an age of 500@xmath0100 myr for the supercluster from main sequence turnoff fits . using strmgren photometry , asiain et al .",
    "( 1999 ) estimate 520@xmath0160 myr .",
    "these values are substantially larger than previous literature estimates  eg .",
    "240 myr ( eggen 1983 ) .",
    "they are appreciably larger than the systemic age of 225250  myr determined in this paper for sirius .",
    "there is no way , if this analysis is based on sound assumptions , that the sirius age can be 400  myr .",
    "king et al .",
    "( 2003 ) do emphasize that they have not determined that the supercluster is coeval , nor that the stellar abundances are the same .    if we were to consider the possibility that the interior abundances of sirius a are not determined , we consult the comprehensive study by nrdstrom et al .",
    "( 2004 ) of 7566 nearby , single f and g dwarfs to see what the abundance distribution is . for the subsample within 40 pc of the sun , and at estimated ages near 1 gyr or less , the [ fe / h ] determinations ( see their fig .",
    "28 ) range from about -0.3 to + 0.2 , with a mean value near -0.02 to -0.06 ( the former if the sample is restricted to the subsample with age estimates considered to be accurate ) . as mentioned in",

    "this systemic age would correspond to a much lower progenitor mass of 3.61@xmath00.125@xmath12 .",
    "this unlikely outcome would make sirius a seriously - discrepant data point in the ifmr ( f05 ) .    on the other hand",
