    "the use of copulas has become popular for modeling multivariate data .",
    "initially , the marginal distributions are fitted , using the vast range of univariate models available , and the dependence between variables is then modeled using a copula .",
    "this approach is sometimes easier than seeking a ` natural ' multivariate distribution derived from a probabilistic model , because there may be no suitable multivariate distribution with the required marginals .",
    "baker @xcite gave a class of bivariate and multivariate copulas based on order - statistics , and this work seeks to ` dig deeper ' .",
    "the ordering and some other properties of these copulas are derived here , and the copulas are generalized into further copulas in the bivariate case .",
    "further experience is also gained in fitting distributions derived from the bivariate and multivariate copulas to data .",
    "first , we briefly recapitulate the essential concept of the earlier work .",
    "many topics covered there , such as the connection with bernstein polynomials @xcite and the farlie - gumbel - morgenstern ( fgm ) distribution @xcite , are not repeated here .",
    "the derivation of the class of distributions of interest is most easily done by considering the generation of correlated random variables from independent random variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 with distribution functions @xmath2 and pdfs ( where defined ) @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath4 sets of random variables @xmath5 and @xmath6 are sorted into order statistics @xmath7 and @xmath8 , they can be paired off as @xmath9 , and one such pair randomly selected .",
    "this scheme yields a pair of dependent ( positively correlated ) random variables , the spearman ( grade ) correlation between them being @xmath10 .",
    "the marginal distributions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are still @xmath2 respectively , because a randomly chosen order - statistic from a distribution is just a random variable from that distribution .",
    "we term the resulting bivariate distribution the ` bivariate distribution of order @xmath4 ' .",
    "the procedure also works in the general multivariate case , when @xmath4 sets of @xmath11 random variables can be similarly grouped .",
    "in addition to random variable pairs being selected as described , to be ` in phase ' , they can be chosen to be in antiphase , by pairing @xmath12 with @xmath13 , so giving a negative grade correlation of @xmath14 .",
    "this is not discussed further ; to model negative correlations one simply replaces @xmath15 by @xmath16 in the formulas .",
    "baker @xcite obtained a one - parameter family of bivariate copulas for a given @xmath4 by randomly choosing a pair from @xmath17 with probability @xmath18 , and a pair from @xmath19 with probability @xmath20 ; these random variables have grade correlation @xmath21 .",
    "equivalently , with probability @xmath20 we can choose @xmath0 and @xmath1 randomly and independently from their @xmath4 order statistics @xmath22 etc ; we could then say that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are chosen from independent cycles .",
    "the resulting distributions are a mixture of the distribution of order @xmath4 and the independent distribution .",
    "we term them ` mixture distributions of order @xmath4 ' .",
    "the device of taking mixtures of copulas will be used later to derive new copulas .",
    "some mathematical preliminaries are necessary : the distribution function @xmath23 of the @xmath24th of @xmath4 order statistics is given by @xmath25 ( stuart and ord @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding pdf if it exists is @xmath26 and the bivariate distribution function of a random order - statistic pair is @xmath27    the mixture distribution of order @xmath4 then has distribution function @xmath28 and where applicable , pdf @xmath29 note that the copula in fact has one continuous and one discrete parameter .",
    "there is no need to pair corresponding order statistics : in the most general case the pair @xmath30 can be chosen with probability @xmath31 , so that @xmath32 where for the correct marginal distributions , we must have @xmath33 the matrix @xmath34 is doubly stochastic , and @xmath35 has @xmath36 independent elements . equation ( [ eq : plus ] ) corresponds to the choice @xmath37 .",
    "the birkhoff - von neumann theorem @xcite states that the set of doubly stochastic matrices of order @xmath4 is the convex hull of the set of permutation matrices of order @xmath4 , and that the extreme points of the set are the permutation matrices . here",
    ", we can view ( [ eq : gen ] ) as a mixture of the @xmath38 possible pairings of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 order statistics .",
    "the pairing chosen in ( [ eq : plus ] ) can achieve the largest grade correlation for a given @xmath4 , so the corresponding copula is of special interest . when considering copulas rather than bivariate distribution functions , it is convenient to define analogously to ( [ eq : fkn ] ) the distribution functions of order statistics of @xmath39 as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a bernstein polynomial ; see lorenz @xcite for their mathematical description . then the copula corresponding to ( [ eq : hn ] ) ( the copula of order @xmath4 ) is @xmath42 and for completeness , the mixture copula is @xmath43    the material presented so far , except for the nomenclature and the remarks on the birkhoff - von neumann theorem , was given in @xcite .",
    "the essence of the earlier paper was the derivation of the bivariate distribution of order @xmath4 ( [ eq : hn ] ) and its mixture with a distribution of order 1 to obtain the mixture distribution of order @xmath4 ( [ eq : plus ] ) .",
    "this distribution allows arbitrary correlations , and the corresponding copula ( [ eq : mixcop ] ) has the unusual feature of possessing one continuous and one discrete parameter .    from this point on ,",
    "new results are presented .",
    "the mixture copula ( [ eq : mixcop ] ) is of interest in itself , and some further properties of it are derived , such as its ordering properties .",
    "it is however convenient to start from the more basic copula of order @xmath4 ( [ eq : oldcop ] ) both when deriving properties of ( [ eq : mixcop ] ) and when deriving further copulas . in the next section , some further properties of the bivariate copulas ( [ eq : oldcop ] ) and ( [ eq : mixcop ] ) are given .",
    "the strongest ordering property is positive likelihood ratio dependence ( lrd ) , where @xmath44 when @xmath45 .",
    "the lrd property implies all other quadrant dependence properties ( nelsen , 2006 @xcite ) .",
    "the fgm distribution is known to be lrd ( eg drouet - mari and kotz , 2001 @xcite ) and it is proved here that ( [ eq : hn ] ) is lrd .",
    "the general distribution ( [ eq : gen ] ) is not .",
    "writing for brevity @xmath46 etc , from ( [ eq : hn ] ) we have that @xmath47 where @xmath48 since @xmath49 , the right - hand side can be rewritten as @xmath50 .",
    "this can be factored into @xmath51 since @xmath52 , then @xmath53 .",
    "as @xmath54 , each bracket of ( [ eq : brack ] ) is positive , and the lrd property follows .",
    "it follows straightforwardly that mixture distributions derived from ( [ eq : hn ] ) such as ( [ eq : plus ] ) are also lrd .",
    "the calculation of kendall s tau for ( [ eq : oldcop ] ) and ( [ eq : mixcop ] ) is given in baker @xcite .",
    "blomqvist s medial coefficient or beta is another widely used measure of association , given by @xmath55 . from ( [ eq : hn ] ) , @xmath56 this does not simplify much ; it can also be written @xmath57 there is an additional factor of @xmath18 for the copula ( [ eq : mixcop ] ) .",
    "note that at the median @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and the pdf from ( [ eq : hn ] ) takes a simple form because the series can then be summed , to give @xmath60 since @xmath61 , we have that @xmath62 .    gini s gamma is a coefficient of association that can be expressed as @xmath63 ( nelsen , @xcite ) . for ( [ eq : oldcop ] ) this gives after some algebra @xmath64 there is again an additional factor of @xmath18 for the copula ( [ eq : mixcop ] ) .",
    "note that the schweizer - wolff sigma defined as @xmath65 is numerically identical to spearman s rho for ( [ eq : plus ] ) , because it possesses the pqd ( positive quadrant dependence ) property @xmath66 as a consequence of the lrd property .",
    "these dependence measures are shown in figure 1 plotted against @xmath4 .",
    "dependence increases with @xmath4 and the frchet bound is attained as @xmath67 .",
    "the coefficient of tail dependence ( e.g. joe @xcite ) is defined in general as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 , @xmath70 . from its definition , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "the distribution ( [ eq : hn ] ) can be shown after some algebra to yield @xmath73 , so that the random variables are asymptotically independent .",
    "this property also holds for all finite mixture distributions .      the copula ( [ eq : oldcop ] ) and its mixtures possess the radial or reflective symmetry @xmath74 , also seen for example in the frank and plackett copulas .",
    "all existing copulas seem to have the simpler symmetry property @xmath75 .",
    "asymmetry between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is usually handled by using different marginal distributions @xmath76 and @xmath15 , but there is no reason why the copula itself should be symmetric .",
    "asymmetry can not occur for archimedean copulas , for which @xmath75 since @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is a ( decreasing ) function . yet , as order statistics of @xmath1 can be paired with any permutation of order statistics of @xmath0 , and still give marginal distributions @xmath2 , it is easy to construct copulas which do not have this symmetry .",
    "for example , when @xmath79 , the copula @xmath80 which can be written @xmath81 is asymmetric .",
    "it would be interesting to devise tests of this symmetry and to see whether such asymmetric copulas are ever needed in practice .",
    "this short section covers four small points for completeness .",
    "the hazard function @xmath82 takes simple forms in the tails .",
    "when @xmath83 , since the survival function @xmath84 , we have that @xmath85 . only the @xmath86 term of the pdf from ( [ eq : plus ] ) survives , and this gives @xmath87 .",
    "the correlation between the random variables inflates the hazard . in the right - hand tail , where @xmath88 , @xmath89 , only the @xmath90 term survives from ( [ eq : fkn ] ) , for all @xmath24 .",
    "it follows that for @xmath91 , we have @xmath92 as the denominator can be much larger than @xmath93 , the correlation between the random variables can decrease the hazard in the tail .",
    "the pdf from ( [ eq : hn ] ) can be written as a hypergeometric function : @xmath94    median regression is the curve @xmath95 , where @xmath96 .",
    "this does not take any simple form for these distributions .    finally , the pdf from ( [ eq : hn ] ) is proportional to the probability @xmath97 that a random walk in the plane returns to its start point after @xmath98 steps .",
    "given probabilities @xmath99 of moving left or right , and probabilities @xmath100 of moving up or down , so that @xmath101 , we have that @xmath102 so that @xmath103 where @xmath104 , @xmath105 , e.g. @xmath106 . at the median where @xmath107 , the random walk is symmetric , with probability @xmath108 of moving in any direction .",
    "having derived new properties of the copulas ( [ eq : oldcop ] ) and ( [ eq : mixcop ] ) introduced earlier , we now seek to generalize them into bivariate models that could be useful for fitting to data .",
    "the most general form of the bivariate model ( [ eq : gen ] ) could be fitted directly to data for low @xmath4 , and has @xmath36 parameters . from the definition of the grade correlation , we have ( nelsen , 2006 @xcite ) @xmath109 generalizing the proof in baker @xcite , this gives @xmath110    in the most general case , this model can reproduce any copula with increasing accuracy as @xmath67 , and all models of lower order @xmath111 can be written as ( [ eq : gen ] ) for some choice of @xmath35 . however",
    ", this does not help in the construction of simple models with few parameters , which is our aim .",
    "we first discuss several possible approaches , before introducing what seems the most useful new copula , the ` bessel function copula ' .",
    "one possibility for reducing the number of model parameters from @xmath36 would be to modify the scheme for generating correlated random numbers given in the introduction , by first generating a uniformly - distributed random number @xmath112",
    ". then a random variable is chosen as the order statistic number @xmath113 of @xmath114 from @xmath76 , and number @xmath115 of @xmath4 from @xmath15 , where @xmath116 is the ` floor ' function .",
    "this allows the two random variables to be chosen from different orders of order statistic .",
    "the resulting model is a special case of ( [ eq : gen ] ) where @xmath117 .",
    "unfortunately , the resulting distributions , characterised by two discrete parameters , are not mathematically tractable .",
    "we therefore seek instead to obtain models with only a few parameters by generalizing ( [ eq : hn ] ) .",
    "a more general model arises from pairing order statistics only within some range or ranges ; for example , suppose only the 1st to @xmath118th and @xmath119th to @xmath4th order statistics pair , and the remainder associate randomly .",
    "then @xmath120 from ( [ eq : rhos ] ) it follows that @xmath121    this allows a distribution with three discrete parameters where the random variables correlate strongly only in one or both tails .",
    "another way to generate models that are more general than ( [ eq : hn ] ) is to form a finite mixture distribution @xmath122 where @xmath123 .",
    "this of course can be expressed as a special case of ( [ eq : gen ] ) .",
    "the spearman correlation is simply @xmath124      a new distribution can be derived by taking an infinite mixture of models .",
    "this gives copulas indexed by one parameter , if the mixing distribution is a 1-parameter distribution .",
    "in general the pdf is @xmath125 rearranging , @xmath126    an interesting distribution arises on taking @xmath127 where @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 denotes the bessel function of imaginary argument .",
    "this is a special case of 2-parameter discrete bessel function distribution first described by pitman and yor @xcite and later by yuan and kalbfleisch @xcite .",
    "then from the series expansion of the bessel function , we have that @xmath131    the copula is @xmath132 figures [ scatfig1 ] and [ scatfig2 ] illustrate the copula as scatterplots , for @xmath133 and @xmath134 respectively . here",
    "a randomly generated sample of size 1000 was generated from the joint distribution with copula @xmath135 and uniform marginals .",
    "this copula is the first one known to the author that requires special functions ; all others require only exponentials , logarithms , and powers .",
    "the spearman correlation is calculated from ( [ eq : spear ] ) and ( [ eq : wt ] ) as @xmath136 to obtain negative correlations , one sets @xmath137 .    as @xmath138 , ( [ eq : besspdf ] ) gives @xmath139 . as @xmath140 , since @xmath141",
    ", we have that as @xmath142 @xmath143 where @xmath144 .",
    "this shows that @xmath145 if @xmath146 .",
    "hence as @xmath142 the distribution attains the frchet bound . from ( [ eq",
    ": rhos1 ] ) as @xmath147 , we have that @xmath148 , so the grade correlation approaches unity , as it must .    as this copula is not a finite mixture of the copula ( [ eq : oldcop ] ) , the coefficient of tail dependence could be nonzero .",
    "however , using the reflection symmetry of the copula , we have that the coefficient of right ( and left ) tail dependence is @xmath149 , where the double integral in ( [ eq : besscop ] ) is @xmath150 .",
    "the coefficient of tail dependence is thus still zero , except of course in the limit as the frchet - hoeffding bound is approached as @xmath151 .",
    "random variables from this copula can be derived by generating @xmath152 from the discrete bessel distribution , as described by devroye @xcite , and then randomly selecting one of the @xmath152 order - statistic pairs .",
    "this is how figures [ scatfig1 ] and [ scatfig2 ] were generated . here",
    ", @xmath152 was generated using the inverse probability method .",
    "this general strategy would be efficient if many random numbers were required , when unused order statistic pairs could be stored and used in preference to generating fresh ones .",
    "it also requires only generation of random numbers from the marginal distributions , and does not require the use of the inverse probability transformation on these distributions .",
    "the alternative method , of generating @xmath112 and then generating @xmath153 from the conditional distribution @xmath154 is not recommended as it is computationally more time consuming .",
    "one can also take the weight @xmath155 another special case of the bessel function distribution .",
    "after summing the series , this yields the more complex form @xmath156 where @xmath157 , @xmath158 .",
    "the spearman correlation from ( [ eq : spear ] ) is @xmath159 the copula is in general similar to ( [ eq : besscop ] ) but slightly more complex .",
    "still other choices can be made for @xmath160 , but these lead to pdfs that are much less tractable , being infinite sums of hypergeometric functions .",
    "the spearman correlations however are more tractable ; for example taking a displaced poisson distribution for the weights @xmath161 , the spearman correlation may be shown to be @xmath162",
    "a dataset from the australian institute of sport is used as an example .",
    "this is given in cook and weisberg @xcite and has been used as a testbed for new distributions by azzalini and others @xcite . here , percentage body fat and weight of 102 male athletes were used .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the skew distribution of percentage body fat .",
    "the distribution of weight ( not shown ) was also slightly skew .",
    "a suitable univariate model for the marginal distributions was chosen as the lagged normal distribution @xcite , where the random variable @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is gaussian , and @xmath1 is exponential .",
    "in fact , taking @xmath165 gives a distribution that can be skew in either direction and long - tailed to either or both left and right .",
    "taking the normal mean as @xmath166 and standard deviation @xmath167 , and the exponential means as @xmath168 and @xmath169 , the pdf is @xmath170,\\label{eq : pdflag}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath171 is the normal distribution function .",

    "@xmath173 , variance @xmath174 , skewness @xmath175 , and kurtosis @xmath176 . since @xmath171 is a well - known special function , and the distribution function can be written as a function of @xmath171 , and also the moments can be written down , this distribution is quite an attractive choice for fitting data that depart from normality , and are not heavy tailed .",
    "the easy computation of the distribution function makes it particularly attractive for use in fitting multivariate distributions via copulas .",
    "care is needed in computing the pdf and distribution function when @xmath177 or @xmath178 are small .",
    "one can then use the asymptotic expansion for @xmath179 , @xmath180 which avoids the rounding errors implicit in taking the product of very large and very small quantities .",
    "the symmetric form of this distribution , with @xmath181 , is described in johnson , kotz and balakrishnan @xcite , vol .",
    "2 , chap . 24 .    the percentage body fat could be fitted by maximum likelihood to a lagged normal distribution , where only the right tail was needed , so that @xmath182 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the fitted curve , with azzalini s skew normal distribution @xcite also fitted .",
    "both distributions fitted satisfactorily , according to the kolmogorov test , although better fits can be achieved at the expense of using more parameters ; there is even a suggestion of bimodality in the data .",
    "this is possible , as the sample comprises athletes from a variety of different sports .",
    "weight and height look normal , but weight has a lower aic ( akaike information criterion ) if fitted to a lagged normal , and this was done .    the bivariate pdf ( [ eq : pdfp ] ) with @xmath183 fitted the data with a log - likelihood of @xmath184 and a weight @xmath185 .",
    "the observed spearman and pearson correlations were 0.613 and 0.581 , and the predictions from the model were 0.640 and 0.576 .",
    "the bessel function pdf ( [ eq : besspdf ] ) also fitted satisfactorily , with @xmath186 , and predicted spearman correlation of 0.65 , pearson correlation 0.565 .",
    "the fitted value of @xmath187 was @xmath188 . for comparison , the azzalini bivariate distribution @xcite fitted with @xmath189 , with the same number ( 7 ) of parameters .",
    "the point here is that the bessel function copula ( [ eq : besscop ] ) performs satisfactorily , as does the whole copula - based methodology of modeling the marginal distributions individually , and gluing them together with a copula .",
    "one can obtain good fits to the data , without forcing both the marginal distributions to be of the same form .",
    "there is then the freedom to vary the marginal modeling , for example by fitting a bimodal distribution in figure [ fig2 ] , which option is not available on fitting a standard multivariate distribution .",
    "consider the multivariate generalization of the models presented so far .",
    "this topic was only briefly touched on in @xcite , and the results here are new .    denote the @xmath190th of @xmath11 random variables by @xmath191 , and denote the corresponding distribution functions , pdfs , and distribution functions of the @xmath24th of @xmath4 order statistics by @xmath192 and @xmath193 respectively .",
    "the most general multivariate model of order @xmath4 would be @xmath194 where @xmath195 and @xmath196 for all @xmath114 .",
    "this would have @xmath197 parameters . to reduce this number",
    ", one could consider only models in which the random variables are in phase ( or in antiphase , for negative correlations ) in cycles of length @xmath4 .",
    "variables could all be in the same cycle , or some could be in independent cycles .",
    "for example , with 5 variables , two could be paired in one cycle , two in another independent cycle , and the fifth variable be in a cycle of its own . to generate random numbers from such a distribution",
    ", one could compute the @xmath4 order statistics for the 5 variables , and then one random number would decide which order statistic was to be taken for variables 1 and 2 , another independent random number would select the third and fourth random variable pair , and a third independent random choice would select the fifth random variable from among its @xmath4 order statistics . clearly , random numbers for variables in such single cycles could be more efficiently generated by simply choosing a random variable from the appropriate marginal distribution .",
    "the number of models @xmath198 is the number of ways @xmath11 distinguishable objects ( random variables ) fit into @xmath11 or fewer identical boxes ( cycles ) .",
    "this is given by the recursion relation @xmath199 with @xmath200 ( tucker , @xcite ) .",
    "this may be derived by considering the addition of the @xmath11th object .",
    "it must occur in a box containing @xmath201 other objects , where the @xmath202 other objects can be chosen in @xmath203 ways , and the remaining @xmath204 other objects in the other boxes can be arranged in @xmath205 ways .",
    "the recursion relation follows , and the number of mixing parameters for a mixture model is @xmath206 .",
    "table 1 shows the number of models resulting ; the number grows faster than exponentially with @xmath11 .",
    "the table also shows the number of parameters @xmath207 for the subset of models obtained by simply including or excluding random variables from one common cycle .",
    "this simple scheme gives distributions whose marginals allow differing spearman correlations , and is feasible up to dimensions of 5 or 6 , beyond which the number of model parameters becomes excessive .",
    "the multivariate distribution function @xmath208 can be written @xmath209 where the sets @xmath210 run through all possible subsets of the @xmath11 random variables , and where @xmath211 .",
    "the model parameters can be estimated in the same way as described earlier for bivariate mixture models .",
    "with the notation @xmath212 etc , the trivariate case of ( [ eq : bigh ] ) can be written @xmath213 where @xmath214 .",
    "this model was fitted to the percentage of body fat , weight , and height for the australian institute of sport data from cook and weisberg @xcite .    after fitting the three marginal distributions by maximum likelihood , using the lagged normal distribution ,",
    "the trivariate distribution was fitted by maximum likelihood to find the four parameters @xmath215 , keeping the marginal distributions fixed .",
    "subsequently , allowing the parameters of the marginal distributions to float increased the log - likelihood @xmath216 by only a very small amount .",
    "fitting weights that sum to unity poses a computational problem .",
    "the simple solution adopted was to use parameters @xmath217 to @xmath218 , fixing one parameter @xmath219 , and then the @xmath220 sum to unity , while the 4 free parameters can take any value on the real line .",
    "any of the @xmath221 can be set to 0 , but the choice is best altered if the term chosen fits to very small weight @xmath222 , as then all the other @xmath221 become huge .",
    "the observed and predicted pearson and spearman correlations are given in table [ t : two ] , showing fairly good agreement .",
    "a value of @xmath223 was used , but the results are not very sensitive to this , as long as @xmath4 is large enough to allow the highest correlation .",
    "the five fitted weights in ( [ eq:3 ] ) were respectively @xmath224 .",
    "interestingly , the independence ( first ) term is not needed .",
    "a common spearman correlation of @xmath225 derives from the last term in ( [ eq:3 ] ) , and the correlation between weight and height is then boosted by the second term , while that between body fat and weight is boosted by the fourth term .    the trivariate fit by this copula fits just slightly worse than the 3-dimensional azzalini model , in terms of log - likelihood , even although the marginal fits are slightly better .",
    "the azzalini model gave @xmath226 , while this model gave @xmath227 .",
    "unfortunately , this is the ` little rift within the lute ' that limits the usefulness of these multivariate models .",
    "although they can accommodate large and variable correlations , they can not fit an arbitrary correlation matrix .",
    "this was seen much more clearly on moving to a quadrivariate example , taken from a study by penrose @xcite and available online via statlib , in which percentage body fat , weight , height and abdominal circumference were fitted , for a sample of 252 men .",
    "the quadrivariate model in a terse notation , writing e.g. @xmath228 , was @xmath229    although the lagged normal distribution gave satisfactory marginal fits , the quadrivariate model fitted with 14 parameters gave @xmath230 , compared with the quadrivariate azzalini distribution fit of @xmath231 , and most of the weights fitted as zero .",
    "it was clear that the fitted correlations were in general too small .",
    "hence the usefulness of these multivariate distributions seems limited .",
    "following the introduction of a new copula in baker @xcite , it became clear to the author that its properties had not been fully enumerated , and also that it was possible to derive further copulas by generalizing it .",
    "further , only a few bivariate distributions had been fitted to data , and there was no practical experience at all with fitting multivariate distributions .    in this paper , several ways of extending the class of copulas have been given .",
    "perhaps the most promising one is to make the order @xmath4 a random variable from the discrete bessel distribution .",
    "this leads to the ` bessel function ' copula ( [ eq : besscop ] ) , the only copula in the author s experience that requires a special function for its expression .",
    "this copula is indexed by one parameter @xmath187 .",
    "like the frank , clayton and plackett copulas , it contains the independence case @xmath232 , and can attain the frchet bound as @xmath233 .",
    "negative correlations are dealt with by e.g. setting @xmath234 .",
    "the use of this copula has been illustrated by fitting it to the australian institute of sport dataset @xcite .",
    "the fact that the copula must be written either as a double integral , or as a series expansion is a drawback , but in fitting to data by likelihood - based methods , the crucial requirement is that the pdf must be easily computable .",

    "it is also not difficult to generate random variables .",
    "this copula is by the way not archimedean ; archimedean copulas must be associative , but computations showed a difference between @xmath237 and @xmath238 ( lack of associativity ) of up to about 2% .",
    "the properties of the bivariate copulas have been further explored .",
    "the most significant is probably that the original copula in ( [ eq : plus ] ) and its mixtures possess the lrd ( likelihood ratio dominance ) ordering property .",
    "this property is therefore also possessed by the bessel function copula .",
    "the properties of the analogous multivariate copulas have also been studied , but here results are less positive .",
    "they do have some flexibility ; marginal distributions need not have identical parameters , and high correlations can be accommodated . although the hitherto untried process of fitting trivariate and quadrivariate models to data by maximum - likelihood estimation proved entirely feasible",
    ", it seems that despite their many parameters these distributions can not reproduce an arbitrary correlation matrix .",
