    "quantum entanglement serves as the measure of quantum non - local correlations between the subsystems of a composite system .",
    "it has attracted a great deal of attention in recent times because of its crucial role in quantum information theory , quantum computation and quantum teleportation  @xcite . quantum entanglement has bizarre consequences which have baffled physicists over the years  @xcite . despite this , quantum entanglement is now universally acknowledged as a useful resource which can be harnessed for a number of applications , e.g. , superdense coding  @xcite , quantum teleportation  @xcite , quantum cryptography  @xcite , creation of a quantum computer  @xcite etc .    in most cases it is desirable to have maximum possible entanglement between the subsystems of the compound system .",
    "it is known that random pure states lead to nearly maximal average entanglement .",
    "most of the work so far has concentrated on random pure states which belong to the unitary invariant class ( @xmath0 )  @xcite , which corresponds to systems with broken time - reversal symmetry .",
    "it is natural to investigate time - reversal symmetric systems , i.e. , random pure states belonging to the orthogonal ( @xmath1 ) or symplectic ( @xmath2 ) invariant classes .",
    "recently there has been some work on systems with orthogonal invariance and now there are some important results available for systems with finite as well as large hilbert space dimensions @xcite . for systems with symplectic invariance",
    "there has been work concerning only large dimensions and for extreme eigenvalue statistics @xcite . for these systems the distribution of schmidt eigenvalues and various entanglement measures have not been investigated for finite dimesional cases .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to treat the random pure states belonging to all three invariant classes of random matrices  @xcite on equal footing and obtain results valid for systems with arbitrary hilbert space dimensions .",
    "we derive here the spectral density of schmidt eigenvalues for arbitrary dimensions .",
    "we also derive the average von neumann entropy and show that maximum average entanglement is achieved if one considers systems belonging to the symplectic invariant class .",
    "the presentation scheme in this paper is as follows .",
    "we begin with the brief introduction to the wishart - laguerre ensemble and give exact results for the spectral density in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we briefly discuss the quantum entanglement problem in bipartite systems .",
    "section 4 deals with the fixed - trace wishart - laguerre ensemble which is relevant for the entanglement problem .",
    "we obtain in this section closed results for the spectral density of schmidt eigenvalues for all three invariant classes of random matrix ensembles . in section 5",
    "we calculate the average von neumann entropy . by comparing the von - neumann entropies in the three cases ,",
    "we show that , as far as average value is concerned , maximum entanglement is achieved for @xmath2 .",
    "finally , we conclude in section 6 with summary and some general remarks .",
    "some proofs of the results are outlined in the appendices .",
    "wishart - laguerre ensembles were introduced by wishart  @xcite in connection with the analysis of multivariate distributions .",
    "these ensembles comprise the @xmath3-dimensional matrices @xmath4 where the @xmath5 are @xmath6 dimensional matrices having its elements as independent and identical ( iid ) gaussian random variables .",
    "wishart - laguerre ensembles arise explicitly in a number of problems in completely unrelated areas . besides the quantum entanglement problem  @xcite some other examples are chaotic mesoscopic systems  @xcite , low energy qcd and gauge theories  @xcite , quantum gravity  @xcite , quantitative finance  @xcite , communication theory  @xcite , gene expression data analysis  @xcite etc .",
    "consider the elements of the matrices @xmath5 constituting the wishart - laguerre ensemble @xmath7 as real , complex or quaternion - real zero - mean iid gaussian variables .",
    "these three cases lead to the three invariant classes of ensembles referred to as orthogonal , unitary and symplectic ensembles and are designated by the dyson index @xmath8 and 4  @xcite .",
    "we choose @xmath9 for definiteness .",
    "the probability distribution followed by @xmath5 is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the variance of each distinct real component of matrix elements of @xmath5 .",
    "the respective joint probability density ( jpd ) of eigenvalues ( @xmath12 ) of @xmath7 for the three cases come out as  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the vandermonde determinant and the parameter @xmath17 is defined as @xmath18 the normalization @xmath19 can be evaluated using the selberg integral  @xcite and turns out to be @xmath20 note that ( [ jpd ] ) is obtained from ( [ pd ] ) for the choice @xmath21 .",
    "some authors choose @xmath22 ( see for example  @xcite ) , in which case apart from the change in normalization , the jpd in ( [ jpd ] ) will have additional factor of 1/2 in the exponential .      in many cases",
    "one is interested in the study of quantities which are linear statistics on the eigenvalues .",
    "these quantities do not contain products of different eigenvalues .",
    "the averages of these can be evaluated using a single integral over the level - density of the eigenvalues , defined as @xmath23 from random matrix theory  @xcite we know that , for the classical ensembles , the above density can be obtained in terms of classical orthogonal polynomials for @xmath0 and in terms of classical skew - orthogonal polynomials for @xmath24  @xcite .    for the wishart - laguerre ensemble defined by jpd  ( [ jpd ] ) ,",
    "the exact expressions for level - densities are known for all @xmath25  @xcite in terms of associated laguerre polynomials @xmath26  @xcite and the corresponding weight function @xmath27 .",
    "consider the parameter @xmath28 defined by @xmath29 we have for unitary ensemble ( @xmath0 ) , @xmath30.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second line in the above equation has been obtained using the christoffel@xmath31darboux sum  @xcite .",
    "other expressions equivalent to the above sum are also possible ; see ( [ r1_ue_alt ] ) .",
    "finally we consider symplectic ensemble ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "similar to @xmath1 , the level density in this case also is given in terms of the corresponding skew - orthogonal polynomials .",
    "we use the expansion of these skew - orthogonal polynomials given in terms of orthogonal polynomials to obtain the following closed expression for the level - density  @xcite : @xmath38 note that in view of definition given by ( [ param ] ) , the parameter @xmath28 assumes only integral or half - integral values ( the wishart case ) , however , the above results hold for all real @xmath39 ( the laguerre case ) .",
    "comparison between the above theoretical results and corresponding numerical simulations is shown in figure 1 .",
    "they are in excellent agreement .    for large @xmath3 ,",
    "the density is described by the marcenko - pastur formula  @xcite , @xmath40 here @xmath41 .",
    "consider a bipartite partition of an @xmath42-dimensional hilbert space @xmath43 consisting of subsystems @xmath44 and @xmath45 which span hilbert spaces @xmath46 and @xmath47 such that @xmath48 .",
    "for example , @xmath44 may be a set of spins and @xmath45 can be a heat bath . without loss of generality",
    "we choose @xmath49 .",
    "we take @xmath50 to be a quantum state of the composite system and @xmath51 , @xmath52 as the complete basis of @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively .",
    "the state @xmath50 can then be expanded as the linear combination @xmath53 we focus on the situation where @xmath50 is a pure state , so that the density matrix of the composite system is given by @xmath54 , with the constraint @xmath55=1 $ ] , which is equivalent to @xmath56 .",
    "the density matrix for the pure state @xmath50 can be written as @xmath57 the reduced density matrix for subsystem , say @xmath44 , can be obtained by tracing out the subsystem @xmath45 .",
    "we obtain @xmath58 where @xmath59 can be viewed as the matrix elements of some matrix @xmath60 , @xmath61 being @xmath6 dimensional . in the diagonal basis ,",
    "( [ rdma ] ) can be written as @xmath62 the @xmath63 are referred to as schmidt eigenvalues .",
    "the trace condition restricts the schmidt eigenvalues to the following constraint @xmath64 @xmath50 is called a random pure state if the coefficients @xmath65 are chosen at random from some given probability distribution .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the schmidt eigenvalues correspond to wishart type of matrices .",
    "however , the conservation of probabilities for quantum states constrains the trace of these matrices . in earlier works wishart - laguerre ensembles",
    "have been used to model random quantum states  @xcite .",
    "however , they do not provide a complete quantitative description of the random quantum states due to the neglect of fixed trace condition  @xcite .",
    "the deviations are prominent particularly when the hilbert space - dimension of the smaller subsystem is not large .",
    "detailed discussion of superiority of fixed - trace ensemble over the ordinary wishart - laguerre ensemble for describing random quantum states can be found in  @xcite .",
    "consider the matrix elements @xmath65 as iid ( real , complex or quaternion - real ) gaussian variables with zero mean , such that the fixed trace condition ( [ ftc ] ) is satisfied .",
    "the probability distribution for @xmath61 is given by @xmath66 correspondingly the jpd of schmidt eigenvalues ( @xmath67 , j=1, ... ,n$ ] ) is obtained as @xmath68 note that , with the fixed trace condition , ( [ ftc ] ) , the exponential term in ( [ jpd ] ) becomes a constant and one is left with ( [ ftjpd ] ) .",
    "the normalization constant in the above equation is @xmath69 where @xmath19 is given by ( [ c ] ) ; see [ ccft ] .",
    "the three @xmath70 values ( 1 , 2 , 4 ) in ( [ ftjpd ] ) again correspond to the cases when the coefficients @xmath65 in ( [ dm ] ) are real , complex or quaternion - real . also , the choice of variance of gaussian elements is immaterial in this case .",
    "the level - density of schmidt eigenvalues is , @xmath71 note that because of the presence of delta function constraint the original limits of integration @xmath72 $ ] can be replaced by @xmath73 .",
    "we give here the exact expressions for the level density of schmidt eigenvalues obtained from the jpd  ( [ ftjpd ] ) .",
    "proof is briefly outlined in appendices b and c.    we need the following to express the desired results compactly :    @xmath74    @xmath75    @xmath76    @xmath77    @xmath78    @xmath79    @xmath80,~\\ ] ]    @xmath81    here @xmath82 is the regularized hypergeometric function .",
    "we first consider the unitary case ( @xmath0 ) , which has been considered by several authors . in  @xcite the result was announced for the square case ( @xmath83 ) in terms of sum involving hypergeometric@xmath84 .",
    "later the result was extended to rectangular case and was given in terms of sum comprising hypergeometric@xmath85  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    "a triple sum expression has been given .",
    "we give here a result , valid for all @xmath86 , which is much simpler than those obtained earlier and is given as a single sum over the hypergeometric@xmath87 .",
    "we have @xmath88    the spectral density for the orthogonal case ( @xmath1 ) has been obtained for @xmath3 even in  @xcite .",
    "we consider here both even and odd @xmath3 cases .",

    "note that we do not take into account the kramers degeneracy explicitly and use the jpd given by  ( [ ftjpd ] ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath95    of particular interest is the case of @xmath96 and arbitrary @xmath97 , as it corresponds to a physical situation where a single qubit is entangled to a heat bath . in this case",
    "the expression for level density is simple and can be obtained directly from ( [ ftjpd ] ) .",
    "we have for all three @xmath70 , @xmath98 where @xmath99 is given by @xmath100 for large @xmath101 , @xmath102 close to 1/2 dominates the level density ( [ densn2 ] ) and we obtain , @xmath103 as can be seen in figure [ fig - schmit ] as @xmath101 increases the two maxima move closer and closer towards @xmath104 and become sharply peaked like delta function for @xmath105 .",
    "we have numerically generated fixed trace wishart - laguerre ensemble by considering matrices @xmath106 , where @xmath107 as above form the wishart - laguerre ensemble .",
    "comparison of the above theoretical results with numerics is shown in figure .",
    "they agree perfectly .",
    "the level densities obtained above give good description of the schmidt eigenvalues .",
    "these expressions are important because the statistical properties of entanglement are encoded in the schmidt eigenvalues . for the unitary case",
    "the one - level density has been found to describe accurately the distribution of the schmidt eigenvalues over the whole range for coupled quantum systems exhibiting chaos @xcite .",
    "this confirms the existence of universality for the distribution of the schmidt eigenvalues in quantum chaos .",
    "the level - densities can be used to calculate the averages of quantities which are linear statistics on schmidt eigenvalues , e.g. , purity , von neumann entropy , rnyi entropy etc .",
    ", thereby giving insight into the extent of entanglement .",
    "as discussed above , the information about the degree of entanglement is stored in the schmidt eigenvalues .",
    "one can construct a suitable measure of entanglement by considering a function of these eigenvalues whose value will tell us how entangled a pure state is .",
    "von neumann entropy serves as an important measure of degree of entanglement .",
    "it is an extension of classical entropy concepts to the field of quantum mechanics . in terms of the schmidt eigenvalues , it is defined as @xmath108 it acquires the maximum value of @xmath109 , when each of the scmidt eigenvalues assume the value @xmath110 . on the other hand the minimum value of 0 is obtained when one of the eigenvalues is one and rest are zero .",
    "these two scenarios correspond respectively to maximally entangled and completely unentangled ( separable ) cases .",
    "to calculate the average von neumann entropy , @xmath111 , we need to perform the following integral : @xmath112 as in ( [ r1 ft ] ) , we have again considered the limits of integrations as @xmath73 instead of @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "von neumann entropy being a linear statistic , the symmetry of the eigenvalues in jpd allows us to reduce the above average involving @xmath3 integrals to an average involving a single integral , i.e. , @xmath113 the above calculation can be done using the results for level density given in preceding section .",
    "however , it turns out that the above average over the fixed trace ensemble can be reduced directly to an average over the ordinary wishart - laguerre ensemble by introducing an auxiliary gamma function integral  @xcite .",
    "the latter route to calculation of average von - neumann entropy is somewhat more straightforward and we follow it below .",
    "as shown in [ agfim ] we have , @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the level density for ordinary wishart - laguerre ensemble , as given in ( [ r1 ] ) and @xmath116 represents the digamma function defined by @xmath117 equation ( [ e2beta ] ) gives a compact expression for the average von neumann entropy for all three @xmath70 values . for @xmath118",
    ", the average von neumann entropy can be found from ( [ e2beta ] ) using the marcenko - pastur density given by ( [ mp ] ) .",
    "also in this limit @xmath119 using ( [ mp ] ) , the integral in ( [ e2beta ] ) is obtained as @xmath120 , thereby giving the large @xmath3 result for all three @xmath70 as @xmath121 the above result was obtained for @xmath0 in @xcite .",

    "to evaluate the integral in ( [ e2beta ] ) we use the following identity : @xmath122 the evaluation of the above integral for the three invariant classes involves the use of properties followed by laguerre polynomials @xcite and its expansion ( [ laguerre ] ) .",
