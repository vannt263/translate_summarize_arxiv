    "we showed that the dimension @xmath7 is critical in the sense that the results obtained for @xmath24 diverge if they are naively extrapolated to @xmath7 . on a physical point of view , the two - dimensional problem differs from the @xmath24 case in two respects : in the 2d case , the central density of the equilibrium state is infinite at the critical temperature @xmath339 while it is finite at @xmath339 in higher dimensions . on the other hand , in @xmath7 , the self - similar collapse results in a dirac peak which contains a finite fraction of mass , while for @xmath24 , the mass contained in the core tends to zero at the collapse time ( but a dirac peak is always formed in the canonical ensemble after @xmath260 as discussed in appendix [ sec_cold ] ) .",
    "we have also evidenced another characteristic dimension @xmath18 at which the nature of the problem changes . for @xmath116 the classical spiral characterizing isothermal spheres in the physical three - dimensional space disappears . however , since the points in the spiral correspond to unstable states , that are therefore unphysical , this transition at @xmath18 is not so critical and indeed the nature of the self - similar collapse does not show any transition at that dimension .",

    "an extension of our study would be to relax the high friction limit and consider solutions of the kramers - poisson system and other relaxation equations described in ref .",
    "these equations are expected to display qualitatively similar behaviors than those described here ( i.e. gravitational collapse , finite time singularity , self - similar solutions , ... ) but their study appears to be of considerable difficulty since we now need to consider the evolution of the system in phase space .",
