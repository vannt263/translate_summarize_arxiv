    "the phase structure of qcd is one of the most fascinating problems in the field of strong interaction physics .",
    "so far , most studies have been performed under the assumption that the condensates which define the different phases are homogeneous . on the other hand",
    ", there are good arguments to believe that there could be inhomogeneous phases as well .",
    "well known examples from the literature are , for instance , the chiral density wave  @xcite , the skyrme crystal  @xcite , and crystalline color superconductors  @xcite .",
    "they also emerge in the large @xmath0-limit of the @xmath1 dimensional gross - neveu model @xcite .",
    "in the main part of this talk we concentrate on color superconductors .",
    "in bcs theory , pairing occurs among fermions with opposite momenta , forming cooper pairs with zero total momentum .",
    "if both fermions are at their respective fermi surface , the pair can be created at no free - energy cost and the pairing is always favored as soon as there is an attractive interaction .",
    "this is , however , no longer the case if the fermi momenta of the fermions to be paired are unequal .",
    "this situation arises naturally in quark matter as a consequence of the heavier strange quark mass and requirements of neutrality and beta equilibrium @xcite .",
    "bcs pairing then requires that the fermi spheres first have to be equalized .",
    "this could be realized , e.g. , in a weak process which replaces some of the down quarks by strange quarks . of course",
    ", it will only be favorable if the free energy which is needed for this process is overcompensated by the pairing energy .",
    "consequently there is a limit for this mechanism in terms of the fermi momentum difference in the unpaired system and the bcs gap  @xcite .",
    "an alternative option is then that the matter becomes inhomogeneous  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to form cooper pairs with non - zero total momentum .",
    "this has the obvious advantage that the fermions in the pair no longer have to have opposite momenta , and therefore each of them can stay on its respective fermi surface . in the context of color superconductors ,",
    "this possibility has been investigated first in ref .",
    "the authors restricted themselves to a plane - wave ansatz for the gap function , as suggested first by fulde and ferrell ( ff ) in the context of metallic superconductors  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "since in the ff ansatz the total momentum of the pair is restricted to a non - zero but constant value , this pairing pattern is strongly disfavored by phase space in most cases .",
    "one should therefore consider a multiple plane wave ansatz , as originally suggested by larkin and ovchinnikov ( lo ) @xcite . in the context of color superconductors , this",
    "was discussed , e.g. , in refs .",
    "as expected , the resulting solutions were found to be strongly favored against the ff phase .",
    "however , these analyses were restricted to a ginzburg - landau approximation . moreover ,",
    "the crystal structures have been restricted to superpositions of a finite number of plane waves whose wave vectors all have the same length , whereas one should also allow for the superposition of different wave lengths . a first step to overcome these shortcomings",
    "was done in ref .",
    "@xcite where inhomogeous pairing was studied within an njl model .",
    "the main ideas of this paper will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : csc ] .",
    "more recently , the idea of having inhomogeneous phases in the context of the _ chiral _ phase transition was revisited in refs .",
    "@xcite for the njl model . in this case",
    "the transition from a dynamically broken to the chirally restored phase when increasing the chemical potential is delayed by the formation of an inhomogeneous chirally broken ground state .",
    "also the orders of the phase transitions are modified .",
    "this will be discussed briefly in sec .",
    "[ sec : chiral ] .",
    "we consider an njl - type lagrangian for massless quarks @xmath2 with three flavor and three color degrees of freedom , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the diagonal matrix of chemical potentials .",
    "the interaction term is given by @xmath5 here @xmath6 is a dimensionful coupling constant and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the matrix of charge conjugation . @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the antisymmetric gell - mann matrices acting in flavor space and color space , respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath11 corresponds to a quark - quark interaction in the scalar flavor - antitriplet color antitriplet channel . applying standard bosonization techniques , the interaction term ,",
    "can equivalently be rewritten as @xmath12 with the auxiliary complex boson fields @xmath13 , which , by the equations of motion , @xmath14 , can be identified with scalar diquarks . in mean field approximation",
    "we replace these quantum fields by their expectation values @xmath15 where the `` gap function '' @xmath16 is now a classical field . here",
    "we assume that the condensation takes place only in the diagonal flavor - color components of the gap matrix , @xmath17 , as in the standard ansatz for the cfl or the 2sc phase .",
    "note , however , that we retain the full space - time dependence of the field .",
    "introducing nambu - gorkov bispinors , @xmath18 and the notation @xmath19 , we obtain the effective mean - field lagrangian @xmath20 with the inverse dressed quark propagator @xmath21 since @xmath22 is bilinear in the nambu - gorkov fields , they can formally be integrated out and we obtain the mean - field thermodynamic potential per volume @xmath23 @xmath24\\otimes v }       \\hspace{-3mm}d^4x\\ ;        \\frac{|\\delta_{a}(x)|^2}{4h}\\,.\\ ] ] note , however , that the evaluation of the functional @xmath25 is highly nontrivial because of the @xmath26 dependent gap functions .    to proceed , we assume that the gap matrix @xmath27 is time independent and periodic in space , @xmath28 , @xmath29 . hence , @xmath30 can be decomposed into a discrete set of fourier components @xmath31 where the allowed momenta @xmath32 form a reciprocal lattice in momentum space .",
    "the inverse propagator is then a matrix whose momentum components are given by @xmath33 note that in general @xmath34 is not diagonal in momentum space because the condensates @xmath35 couple different momenta .",
    "physically , this corresponds to processes like the absorption of a hole with momentum @xmath36 by the condensate together with the emission of a quark with momentum @xmath37 .",
    "this is only possible because the inhomogeneous diquark condensates carry momentum . in the homogeneous case , @xmath38 , only the momentum component @xmath39 exists , and the in- and outgoing quark momenta are equal .",
    "while this is no longer true for our inhomogeneous ansatz , the fact that we consider a static solution still guarantees that the _ energy _ of the quark is conserved .",
    "this means , @xmath34 is still diagonal in the matsubara frequencies @xmath40 , which can therefore be summed in the usual way .",
    "to that end we write @xmath41 defining the effective hamilton operator @xmath42 , which does not depend on @xmath40 .",
    "since @xmath42 is hermitian , it can in principle be diagonalized . in this context",
    "it is important that , since the momenta @xmath43 of the condensates form a reciprocal lattice , not all momentum components are coupled with each other , but @xmath42 is block diagonal with one block @xmath44 for each vector @xmath45 in the brioullin zone ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "we then finally obtain for the thermodynamic potential @xmath47      \\,+ \\sum\\limits_a\\sum\\limits_{q_k } \\frac{|\\delta_{a , q_k}|^2}{4h } , \\label{omcont}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 are the eigenvalues of @xmath44 . here",
    "one should note that @xmath44 is not only an infinite matrix in momentum space , but each momentum component is also a @xmath49 matrix corresponding to 4 dirac , 3 color , 3 flavor , and 2 nambu - gorkov components .",
    "the numerical studies below are therefore performed in a simplified model , where the main focus is on the new features related to the inhomogeneity . to that end",
    "we consider a 2sc - like pairing scheme , where only two flavors ( `` up '' and `` down '' ) and two colors ( `` red '' and `` green '' ) are paired , so that the remaining ones ( `` strange '' and `` blue '' ) decouple .",
    "we assume that the chemical potentials may be different for up and down quarks , @xmath50 but do not depend on color .",
    "furthermore , we simplify the dirac structure via a high - density approximation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the problem is then reduced to diagonalize an effective hamiltonian whose momentum components are only @xmath51 matrices , @xmath52    finally , we should note that the thermodynamic potential as defined in eq .",
    "( [ omcont ] ) is divergent and needs to be regularized . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a restriction of the momenta of the effective hamiltonian , which would be a straight forward generalization of the standard momentum cutoff in homogeneous phases , leads to strong regularization artifacts .",
    "we therefore suggest a pauli - villars like regularization scheme , where the regulator terms are given by replacing the free - energy eigenvalues @xmath53 by @xmath54 .      in the following , we restrict ourselves to @xmath55 and to a fixed average chemical potential @xmath56  mev , so that @xmath57 is the only remaining external variable .",
    "our model has two parameters , namely the coupling constant @xmath6 and the cutoff parameter @xmath58 .",
    "having fixed the cutoff , we can express the coupling constant @xmath6 through the corresponding value of the bcs gap at @xmath59 .",
    "the examples shown below correspond to @xmath60  mev and @xmath61  mev .",
    "we remind that @xmath58 restricts the free energies and not the momenta .",
    "thus , the most relevant excitations around the fermi surface are always included , and there is no need for @xmath58 to be larger than the chemical potential .",
    "our goal is to find the most stable solution , i.e. , the minimum of @xmath62 with respect to the gap function @xmath63 .",
    "since the general solution of this problem is rather difficult , we restrict ourselves to one dimensional modulations , i.e. , to gap functions which vary periodically in one spatial direction ( @xmath64-direction ) , but stay constant in the two spatial directions ( @xmath26 and @xmath65 ) , @xmath66 moreover , we assume that @xmath67 is real , @xmath68 .    in a first step ,",
    "we take a fixed period , i.e. , a fixed value of @xmath2 and minimize the thermodynamic potential with respect to the fourier components @xmath69 . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : deltaq ] we present examples we obtained for @xmath70 . at @xmath71",
    "the gap function appears to be sinusoidal . for larger periods , however , a new feature becomes apparent : the formation of a soliton lattice . especially for @xmath72 , we see that the gap function stays nearly constant at @xmath73 for about one half - period and then changes its sign in a relatively small interval .",
    "the @xmath74 solution behaves qualitatively similar , but has a shorter plateau .",
    "remarkably , the shape of the two functions is almost identical in the transition region where the gap functions change sign .",
    "this remains even true for the @xmath75 solution , which is kind of an extreme case with no plateau and only transition regions .",
    "we may thus interprete these transition regions as very weakly interacting solitons , which are almost unaffected by the presence of the neighboring ( anti- ) solitons as long as they do not overlap .",
    "it turns out that the gap functions can be fitted remarkably well by jacobi elliptic functions , @xmath76 , which is the known shape of the gap functions in @xmath1 dimensions  @xcite ( see eq .",
    "( [ mod ] ) below ) .",
    "an important difference is , however , that in @xmath77 dimensions the amplitude @xmath78 is not directly related to the elliptic modulus @xmath79 , but must be fitted independently .    for each @xmath57 , with the solutions for the different chosen values of @xmath2 at hand",
    ", we now have to minimize the thermodynamic potential in @xmath2 . the resulting free energy gain compared to the normal conducting solution",
    "is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : deltaq ] .",
    "while the bcs solution ( solid line ) and the normal solution are favored at low and high @xmath57 , respectively , there is a window at intermediate @xmath57 where the inhomogeneous solution is favored .",
    "note that for the general one - dimensional ansatz ( dashed line ) , this window is about twice as wide as it would be for the single plane - wave ansatz ( ff phase , dotted ) , which is energetically much less favored .",
    "most striking , whereas the bcs - ff phase transition would be first order , the transition from the bcs phase to the general one - dimensional phase is second order .",
    "this is possible because the most favored value of @xmath2 in the inhomogeneous phase goes continuously to zero , when @xmath57 is reduced towards the phase boundary , see left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : qamp ] ( solid line ) .",
    "the corresponding amplitude of the gap function is displayed on the right - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : qamp ] . unlike the ff amplitude ( dotted ) ,",
    "the amplitude of the general one - dimensional gap function stays of the order of @xmath80 at large @xmath57 . as a consequence ,",
    "the phase transition to the normal phase is first order .",
    "the resulting behavior of the gap function with increasing @xmath57 is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltax ] .",
    "more recently , a similar study of inhomogeneous phases has been performed for the chiral phase transition  @xcite . here , instead of the color superconducting gap , the chiral condensate or , equivalently , the `` constituent quark mass '' was allowed to have general one - dimensional periodic modulations .",
    "this case actually turned out to be simpler , because it can be shown that the analytically known mass functions @xmath81 of the @xmath1 dimensional gross - neveu model  @xcite can be lifted to @xmath77 dimensions by lorentz boosts  @xcite .",
    "apart from the irrelevant shift @xmath82 , this function depends only on two parameters @xmath83 and @xmath79 , which are related to the wave vector @xmath84 ( @xmath85 complete elliptic integral of the first kind ) and the amplitude @xmath86 .",
    "thus , at each temperature and chemical potential , the thermodynamic potential must be minimized w.r.t .",
    "@xmath83 and @xmath79 . ) corresponds to the chiral limit .",
    "it is possible to to generalize this solution to finite current quark masses  @xcite , introducing a third parameter . ]",
    "the resulting phase diagram for a two - flavor njl model in the chiral limit is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : chiral ] . when the solutions are restricted to homogeneous condensates ,",
    "the phase transition is first order at lower temperatures ( red long - dashed line ) and second order at higher temperatures ( black dotted line ) .",
    "however , when inhomogeneous condensates are taken into account , the first - order phase boundary becomes completely hidden by an inhomogeneous phase ( orange shaded region ) .",
    "the latter is bordered by two second - order boundaries , whose intersection defines a lifshitz point . in the njl model",
    "the lifshitz point precisely agrees with the critical point  @xcite , similar to the findings in the gross - neveu model .    on the r.h.s . of fig .",
    "[ fig : chiral ] , we display the wave vector @xmath87 ( dashed line ) and the average amplitude of the mass function ( solid line ) as functions of the chemical potential @xmath88 at @xmath55 .",
    "similar to the superconducting case , @xmath87 goes to zero at the lower end of the inhomogeneous phase , so that the latter is continuously connected to the homogeneous phase with broken chiral symmetry . at the upper end",
    ", the amplitude goes to zero , and the inhomogeneous phase is smoothly connected to the chirally restored phase .",
    "the results presented here should be considered as first steps towards a more complete picture of the phase diagram with inhomogeneous phases , and much remains to be done . in the context of the chiral phase transition",
    "one should couple the quarks to the polyakov loop and study the influence of other interaction channels  @xcite . on the color - superconductivity side",
    ", one should calculate the equation of state for globally neutral quark matter in beta equilibrium and extend the analysis to finite temperature .",
    "eventually , superconducting and chiral condensates should be treated simultaneously to obtain a unified phase diagram . moreover",
    ", the model should be extended to @xmath89 flavors .",
    "the restriction to inhomogeneities with one - dimensional modulations should not be the last word , but it would be interesting to study two- or even three - dimensional modulations as well . technically , this is of course much more demanding .",
    "eventually , however , one would like to study the transition from a single nucleon ( described as a single soliton @xcite ) to nuclear matter and finally to color - superconducting quark matter .",
