    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) continue to surprise us . with the _ swift _ satellite @xcite providing quick and accurate localizations for many bursts ( for example",
    ", 20 grbs were localized between january 1st - february 15th , 2006 ) , it is now possible to find and study in even more detail bursts which are `` unusual '' .",
    "those are more than just mere curiosity ",
    "they test and verify our understanding of physics of these extreme events .",
    "the physics of grb afterglow emission appears on solid footing .",
    "the grb sweeps up ambient gas and the resulting shock emits synchrotron radiation from x - rays to radio wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the light curve decays as a power - law with a break when the opening angle of the beamed emission exceeds the opening angle of the jet ( e.g. , stanek et al .",
    "1999 ; rhoads 1999 ) .",
    "but the fast localizations of the _ swift _ satellite means that optical and x - ray observations can begin before the @xmath14-rays have completely faded . the transition between the end of the `` prompt '' emission and the rise of the shocked ambient gas emission is uncertain territory . internal shocks",
    "may be the source of prompt emission or continued activity from the central engine may inject more energy into the external shock . deciphering the effects of these processes",
    "requires high - quality observations obtained rapidly after the burst .",
    "what also helps is time dilation .",
    "high - redshift bursts have the advantage of being observed in slow motion .",
    "two such high - redshift bursts have been recently detected by the _",
    "swift _ satellite .",
    "grb060206 triggered _",
    "swift_-bat on feb . 6 , 04:46:53 ut @xcite . a likely afterglow has been identified by @xcite , who also determined that the afterglow was at high redshift of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "a presence of a bright afterglow has been reported by several groups , most notably by raptor @xcite , who indicated that the afterglow has increased in brightness by @xmath15mag about 1 hour after the burst .",
    "@xcite has released detailed description of the raptor data for this event , which we will discuss later in this paper .",
    "grb060210 triggered _",

    "10 , 04:58:50 ut @xcite .",
    "@xcite have quickly identified a possible afterglow , and @xcite measured a high redshift of @xmath6 .",
    "kait robotic telescope has obtained extensive optical observations starting as soon as 62 sec after the burst @xcite , indicating that the afterglow brightened by 0.4 mag by 9 minutes after the burst @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported on the _",
    "swift_-xrt data , which showed two strong flares 200 sec and 385 sec after the trigger , followed by a power - law decay .",
    "in this paper we report on our optical follow - up of these two bursts .",
    "our data , described in section 2 , combined with the data reported in the literature clearly shows two very unusual optical afterglows , whose evolution we describe in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we analyze _ swift_-xrt data for these two events .",
    "we briefly summarize our results and discuss their implications in section 5 .",
    "the majority of our data were obtained with the mdm-2.4 m telescope , with additional data obtained using the mdm-1.3 m telescope . for the bright afterglow of grb060206",
    ", we have obtained 83 high signal - to - noise @xmath1-band images between 1.7 and 8.7 hours after the burst , followed by additional 16 @xmath1-band images during the next two nights . for the much fainter afterglow of grb060210",
    ", we have obtained 12 @xmath1-band images between 0.48 and 2.0 hours after the burst , until the object has set .",
    "all the light curves were extracted using isis2 image subtraction package @xcite . to obtain absolute calibration , for grb060206 we used nine stars in the field with sdss photometry @xcite to transform to the standard system fitting a zero - point difference and a color - term .",
    "we used the transformation equations of @xcite to transform sdss griz magnitudes to bvri . for future references and cross - calibrations",
    ", this transformation gives @xmath16mag and @xmath17mag for the star sdss j133130.4 + 350416.1 .",
    "we assumed @xmath18mag for the afterglow @xcite .",
    "the absolute photometric calibration is thought to be better than @xmath195% .",
    "we found that in order to match @xcite data to our data , we had to subtract @xmath20mag from their unfiltered @xmath1-band magnitudes ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "this offset does not affect any of our conclusions . for grb060210 we used the calibration of the field obtained with the kait telescope ( li et al .",
    "2006 , in preparation ) .",
    "a usno - b1 @xcite star 1170 - 0048923 at @xmath2103:50:53.00 , @xmath2227:01:30.54 ( j2000 ) , which is close to the grb , is measured at @xmath23mag using kait calibration , @xmath24mag fainter than the usno magnitude .",
    "this is not unusual , since the magnitudes of stars in the usno - b1 catalog were obtained with photographic plates .",
    "tables  1 and 2 present our @xmath1-band photometry for the two bursts .",
    "we have also analyzed the x - ray data obtained by the _",
    "swift_-xrt instrument .",
    "we started with the xrt level 2 event files for both the windowed timing mode and the photon counting mode observations .",
    "there was a hot ccd column in the windowed timing observation for grb060206 .",
    "we filtered the events on these hot ccd pixels .",
    "we used the ` xselect ` software package to extract the x - ray light curves and spectra .",
    "the background subtracted light curves were adaptively binned according to the signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "we fit the spectra with ` xspec ` ( arnaud 1996 ) to convert xrt count rates to fluxes .",
    "we use the ` rmf ` files from standard xrt calibration distribution , and generated the ` arf ` files with the _ swift_-xrt software tool ` xrtmkarf ` .",
    "figure  [ fig_r ] presents the @xmath1-band light curves for grb060206 and grb060210 ( see tables 1,2 ) .",
    "in addition to our mdm 2.4-m data , we have added some data from the literature to extend the time coverage . for grb060206",
    ", we add one early data point from @xcite and 101 densely sampled raptor data points from @xcite .",
    "for grb060210 , we add eight very early data points from the kait telescope reported by @xcite .",
    "all the literature data were brought to the common zero - point with our data , using overlaps between the data sets .",
    "figure  [ fig_r ] shows most unusual behavior for both afterglows . as described in detail by @xcite",
    ", grb060206 experienced a slow early decay , followed by a rapid increase in brightness by @xmath25mag about 1 hour after the burst .",
    "its afterglow then faded in a typical broken power - law fashion , with a smooth break at @xmath4days , but with additional , less dramatic ( @xmath5 ) `` bumps and wiggles '' , well detected in the densely sampled light curves .",
    "these deviations from smooth decay can be seen better in figure  [ fig_bump ] , where we show the raptor data and our first night mdm data .    to characterize the long timescales behavior of its afterglow",
    ", we have fit all our grb060206 @xmath1-band data with the broken power - law model of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) : @xmath26^{1/s } } , \\label{eq_brokenpower}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the time of the break , @xmath28 is the @xmath1-band flux at @xmath27 and @xmath29 is a parameter which determines the sharpness of the break , where a larger @xmath29 gives a sharper break .",
    "this formula smoothly connects the early time @xmath30 decay ( @xmath31 ) with the later time @xmath32 decay ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the fit results in the following values for the parameters : @xmath34  days . given that the data show clear variations from the smooth behavior , these are only approximate values , and should be treated with caution ( see the discussion below ) .",
    "the overall fit is reasonable and it supports a break in the light curve , traditionally interpreted as a jet break ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is broadly consistent with the behavior in other optical bands reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1-band afterglow of grb060210 ( @xmath6 ) closely resembles recently reported behavior of grb0508101 @xcite , who called that event an `` anomalous early afterglow '' .",
    "the light curve of grb060210 , as reported by @xcite , was more or less flat between 60 and @xmath7sec after the burst , followed by @xmath35mag increase by @xmath9sec after the burst . using @xcite and our data",
    "we show that the light curve then declined as a @xmath36 power - law .",
    "if we bring grb060210 to a fiducial redshift of @xmath37 , which is close to a likely redshift of grb050801 @xcite , then these two burst are even closer in their evolution , as can be seen comparing to their figure  1 .",
    "given the unusual behavior observed in the optical wavelengths for these two bursts , it is useful to investigate their x - ray light curves as well . indeed , x - ray afterglows observed by _",
    "swift_-xrt have been shown to have features @xcite not expected in the standard afterglow models , including giant flares such as observed in grb 050502b @xcite . the origin of the flares is still under investigation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in figure  [ fig_xray1 ]",
    "we compare the x - ray to optical light curves for grb060206 .",
    "while it was intrinsically a very bright afterglow in optical , it was a faint x - ray event , with the ratio of @xmath38 . despite earlier reports to the contrary @xcite , the overall behavior between the two bands is similar , but with clear short - timescale variations , as reported before by @xcite .",
    "however , by analyzing the later xrt observation , we clearly see a nearby , contaminating x - ray source , about @xmath39 away .",
    "this nearby source is most likely variable , obscuring the true behavior of the x - ray afterglow , especially at later times . that also explains the flattening of the late x - ray light curve , as seen in figure  [ fig_xray1 ] .    in figure  [ fig_xray2 ]",
    "we compare the x - ray to optical light curves for grb060210 . here",
    "the ratio of @xmath40 , much lower than for grb060206 . as reported by @xcite ,",
    "x - rays show two strong flares 200 sec and 385 sec after the trigger , followed by a smoother decay . as already reported by dai & stanek ( 2006 ) , the analysis of the entire xrt light curve indicates a presence of a broken power - law .",
    "they fitted both a single power - law and a broken power - law model to the xrt light curve from @xmath41sec to @xmath42sec after the bat trigger .",
    "for the single power - law model they found a decay index of @xmath43 , but the fit was poor .",
    "for the broken power - law model they found @xmath44 , @xmath45hours , with the broken power - law providing a much better fit .",
    "the power - law decay index for the x - ray light curve before the jet break is not consistent with the optical decay index of @xmath46 discussed above .",
    "it would be most interesting to add later @xmath1-band data for this event to see if the x - rays are indeed different from optical .",
    "we note that the x - ray flares in grb060210 do not have corresponding optical peaks ( as far as we can tell from the data reported by * ? ? ?",
    "this would indicate that the x - ray flares are occurring in a different region from where the optical light is formed .",
    "we have presented optical light curves for two recent @xmath47 afterglows , grb060206 and grb060210 .",
    "they both show unusual behavior , with significant re - brightening by as much as factor of @xmath3 about 1 hour ( @xmath48min in the rest frame ) after the burst in case of 060206 .",
    "grb060210 also shows unusual optical evolution , similar to `` anomalous afterglow '' of grb050801 recently described by @xcite .",
    "both bursts show complex behavior in the x - rays as seen with _ swift_-xrt instrument .",
    "significant `` bumps an wiggles '' have been seen before in a number of optical afterglows .",
    "one of the first well - observed afterglows , grb970508 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) had a light curve rather similar in shape to grb060206 , as it brightened by @xmath49mag by @xmath50days after the burst , after which it decayed is a smooth power - law fashion .",
    "grb000301c exhibited achromatic , short - timescale bump that was difficult to reconcile with the standard relativistic shock model , and which was proposed to be caused by microlensing @xcite .",
    "grb021004 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was not only bumpy , but also showed clear color variations in optical bands @xcite .",
    "grb030329 was so bumpy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that if not for the spectroscopic observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we would still argue if it showed a `` supernova bump '' or not .",
    "in fact , a significant deviations from a smooth decay have been seen in the light curve of grb030329 as late as two months after the burst ( so called `` jitter event '' : @xcite ; bersier et al .",
    "2006 , in preparation ) .",
    "bumps have also been seen in some previous swift afterglows ( e.g. , grb050525a : klotz et al . 2005 ) .",
    "given the above and the two bursts discussed in this paper , it is becoming clear that the `` unusual '' or `` anomalous '' optical afterglows might be more of a norm than an exception . and while `` nice and smooth '' afterglows have been seen as well ( e.g. grb990510 : @xcite ; grb020813 : @xcite ; grb041006 : @xcite ) in some well - observed cases , the large number of anomalous optical afterglows can no longer be seen as a small wrinkle on the standard afterglow model .",
    "in fact , unless there is sufficient data to suggest otherwise , it would be only prudent to assume that any given afterglow might be anomalous . as a result ,",
    "some of the often employed procedures , such as deriving the jet opening angle using a broken power - law fit to the optical light curve , in many cases might have a poor statistical significance and be simply not applicable .",
    "finally , given the totality of the data presented in this paper , we believe that the rise at @xmath51sec in the optical for grb060206 and the optical bump at @xmath13sec in grb060210 might be due to the turn - on of the external shock  that is , the grb jet has swept up enough circumstellar / interstellar gas and the magnetic field has developed enough so the standard afterglow has turned - on and it starts to dominate the light in both x - rays and optical .",
    "if that is indeed the case , the existence and timing of such features could provide valuable additional information about the energy of the grb jet and the density of the circumburst medium it is plowing into .",
    "this idea is discussed in more detail by @xcite , when describing the `` anomalous afterglow '' of grb050801 .",
    "we thank the _ swift _ team , scott barthelmy , and the grb coordinates network ( gcn ) for the quick turnaround in providing precise grb positions to the astronomical community , and we thank all the observers who provided their data and analysis through the gcn .",
    "we thank weidong li for useful comments and for providing us with his calibration data for the grb060210 .",
    "we also thank the anonymous referee for useful comments .",
    "we also thank the participants of the morning astro - ph / coffee discussion at the ohio state university for useful input .",
