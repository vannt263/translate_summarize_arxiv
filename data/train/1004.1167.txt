    "previous versions of the catalog ( schneider et al .  2002 , 2003 , 2005 , 2007 ;",
    "hereafter papers  i , ii , iii , and  iv ) were published with the sdss early data release ( edr ; stoughton et al .",

    "2007 ) , and contained 3,814 , 16,713 , 46,420 , and 77,429 quasars , respectively .",
    "the current catalog is the entire set of quasars from the sdss - i and sdss - ii quasar survey ; the sdss - ii was completed on 15 july  2008 and the seventh data release ( dr7 ; abazajian et al .",
    "2009 ) was made public on 31  october  2008 .",
    "the catalog contains 105,783 quasars .",
    "the bulk of the quasars were identified as part of the sdss legacy survey , which consisted of a systematic program to obtain spectra of one million galaxies and 100,000 quasars in two regions : an approximately 7,600  deg@xmath2 area centered on the north galactic pole ( hereafter this region will be referred to as the north galactic cap ) and approximately 800  deg@xmath2 in three narrow regions in the proximity of the celestial equator centered near 0@xmath5 in right ascension ( see york et al .",
    "2000 and abazajian et al .",
    "2009 ) . with this catalog ,",
    "the spectroscopy in the north galactic cap region is now contiguous .",
    "outside of the legacy area quasars were found , frequently serendipitously , on a series of  special plates \" ( see adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2006 ) that were observed when legacy observations could not be performed .",
    "a large fraction of the special plates were obtained as part of two programs : extensions of the legacy target selection algorithms along the fall equatorial region ( adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2006 ) , and the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue ; yanny et al .",
    "2009 ) , a project to study stellar populations in the galactic halo .",
    "the distribution of the dr7 quasars on the celestial sphere is displayed in figure  1 .",
    "the catalog in the present paper consists of quasars that have a luminosity larger than ( calculated assuming an cosmology , which will be used throughout this paper ) .",
    "the objects are denoted in the catalog by their dr7 j2000 coordinates ; the format for the object name is .",
    "since the image data used for the astrometric information can change between data releases ( e.g. , a region with poor seeing that is included in an early release is superseded by a newer observation in good seeing ) , the coordinates for an object can be modified at the  @xmath1  0.1@xmath3 level ( although on rare occasions ( see  6 ) the change in position can exceed  1@xmath3 ) ; hence the designation of a given source can change between data releases .",
    "when merging sdss quasar catalogs with previous databases one should always use the coordinates , not object names , to identify unique entries .",
    "recent additional compilations of quasars based upon sdss data include the dr5 broad absorption line ( bal ) quasar catalog ( gibson et al .",
    "2009 ) , the two degree field - sdss luminous red galaxy and quasar survey ( 2slaq ) spectroscopic catalog ( croom et al .",
    "2009 ) , and a sample of approximately one million  photometric \" quasars ( i.e. , without spectroscopic confirmation ) selected based upon their colors ( richards et al .",

    "2008 ) .",
    "the dr7 catalog does not include classes of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) such as type  2 quasars , seyfert galaxies ( i.e. , low - luminosity agn ) , and bl  lacertae objects .",

    "no emission line equivalent width limit is imposed for inclusion in the present catalog ; there are some quasars with low equivalent width emission lines in the catalog , and they tend to be among the brighter objects ( the higher the quality of the spectra , the easier the identification of small equivalent width features ) , or at relatively high redshift , where redshifts can be measured using absorption from the lyman  @xmath6 forest ( e.g. , fan et al .",

    "closely follow that of the previous four editions of the sdss quasar catalog .",
    "the observations used to produce the catalog are presented in section 2 ; the construction of the catalog and the catalog format are discussed in sections 3 and  4 , respectively .",
    "section  5 presents an overview of the catalog , section  6 contains a discussion of some issues relevant to statistical samples , and a summary is given in section  7 .",

    "the sloan digital sky survey used a ccd camera on a dedicated telescope at apache point observatory , new mexico , to obtain images in five broad optical bands ( @xmath4 ; fukugita et al .",
    "1996 ) over approximately 10,000  deg@xmath2 of the high galactic latitude sky .",
    "the survey data - processing software measures the properties of each detected object in the imaging data in all five bands , and determines and applies both astrometric and photometric calibrations ( pier et al . , 2003 ; hogg et al .",

    "the sdss quasar target selection is described in richards et al .",
    "( 2002 , hereafter gtr02 ) and in papers i - iv ; we provide a brief summary of the identification of candidates and the spectroscopic observations here .",
    "most quasar candidates are selected based on their location in multidimensional sdss color - space .",
    "the point spread function ( psf ) magnitudes are used for the quasar target selection , and the selection is based upon measurements that have been corrected for galactic extinction using the maps of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis  ( 1998 ) .",
    "an @xmath8 magnitude limit of  19.1 is imposed for candidates whose colors indicate a probable redshift of less than  @xmath1  3 ( selected from the @xmath9 color cube ) ; high - redshift candidates ( mainly selected from the @xmath10 color cube , but some @xmath11 are identified in the @xmath9 color cube ; see gtr02 ) are accepted if and the source is unresolved .",
    "in addition to the multicolor selection , unresolved objects brighter that lie within  2.0@xmath3 of a first radio source ( becker , white , &  helfand  1995 ) are also identified as primary quasar candidates .",
    "target selection also imposes a maximum brightness limit on quasar candidates to avoid saturation and cross - talk in the spectra .",
    "the primary sample described above was supplemented by quasars that were targeted by the following sdss spectroscopic target selection algorithms : galaxy and luminous red galaxy ( strauss et al .",
    "2002 and eisenstein et al .  2001 ) , x - ray ( object near the position of a _ rosat _ all - sky survey [ rass ; voges et al .  1999 ,  2000 ]",
    "source ; see anderson et al .",
    "2003 ) , star ( point source with a color typical of an interesting class of star ) , or serendipity ( unusual color or first matches ) .",
    "the sdss is designed to be complete in the galaxy , luminous red galaxy , and quasar programs , but no attempt at completeness was made for the other three categories .",
    "figure  2 shows the locations of stars and quasars in the sdss color - color space ( the quasar measurements are from objects in the dr7 catalog ) .",
    "the final quasar selection algorithm of gtr02 was refined using the results of early sdss observations , so not all objects in this catalog were selected using the gtr02 approach ; all quasars originally reported in papers  i and  ii , and some in paper iii , were identified with pre - gtr02 methods .",
    "the catalog reports two target selection flags for each object : 1 )  target , which is the flag that was used , based upon the imaging information and the selection algorithm available at the time , to select the quasar for the spectroscopic sample , and 2 )  best , which is the flag produced with the gtr02 algorithm and the latest available photometric information .",
    "care must be exercised when constructing statistical samples from this catalog ; see gtr02 , vanden  berk et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and richards et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for discussions of survey completeness and efficiency , and the issues that are important for the construction of statistical sdss quasar samples .",
    "in addition to the quasars found in the legacy survey , the catalog contains many quasars whose spectra were obtained on special plates ( see adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "the main source of special plate quasars is the set of observations along the celestial equator in the southern galactic cap (  stripe  82 \" ; see stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) taken for a variety of commissioning and science purposes ; for example , exploring the variations in the selection criteria of spectroscopic targets and empirically determining the completeness of the quasar survey ( e.g. , vanden berk et al .  2005 ) .",
    "another major component of the special plates are the observations taken for the segue project ( yanny et al .",
    "2009 ) ; these plates usually lie along lines of constant galactic longitude and reach closer to the galactic plane than do the legacy survey fields ( see figure  1 ) . the segue program required sdss imaging outside of the legacy survey area .",
    "the spectroscopic targets identified by the various sdss selection algorithms are arranged onto a series of 3@xmath5 diameter circular fields ( blanton et al .",
    "the two sdss double spectrographs produce data covering at a spectral resolution a dichroic splits the beam at  6150   .",
    "the data , along with the associated calibration frames , are processed by the sdss spectroscopic pipeline ( see stoughton et al .",
    "several improvements have been made to the spectroscopic software since dr5 , in particular the wavelength calibration , spectrophotometric calibration , and the handling of strong , unresolved emission features ( see adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2008 and abazajian et al  2009 for a description of these modifications ) .",
    "the calibrated spectra are classified into various groups ( e.g. , star , galaxy , quasar ) , and redshifts are determined by two independent software packages : spectro1d ( see  4.10.2.1 of stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) , which assigns absorption - line redshifts by cross - correlating the observations with a series of template spectra in fourier space and gaussian fits to emission lines to measure emission - line redshifts ; and specbs ( adelman - mccarthy et al .  2008 ) , which performs @xmath12 fits in wavelength space between the observations and templates . the quality of the redshift is quantified by spectro1d by a parameter called the  confidence limit \" , which is stored in the parameter zconf ( stoughton et al .",
    "a large value of zconf usually indicates a solid redshift measurement , but a low value does not necessarily mean an uncertain redshift ; see  6 for a discussion of this important issue .",
    "the catalog reports the spectro1d redshifts , which have typical quoted redshift errors of  @xmath1  0.004 ( except in the cases where visual inspection found that the spectro1d redshift was incorrect ; see  3.2 ) .",
    "hewett & wild ( 2010 ) present evidence for systematic errors of  @xmath1  0.003 in sdss quasar redshifts measurements ; these errors are small for most applications , but can be significant for some investigations .",
    "the catalog contains photometry from  346 sdss imaging runs acquired between 19",
    "september  1998 ( run  94 ) and 1  january  2008 ( run  7264 ) , and spectra from 2210 spectroscopic plates taken between 5  march  2000 and 6  july  2008 .",
    "figure  3 shows the calibrated sdss spectra of four catalog quasars , added since paper  iv , representing a range of properties .",
    "the processed dr7 spectra _ have not _ been corrected for galactic extinction .",
    "as described above , the quasars in the catalog were drawn from two sets of sdss observations : the legacy survey area , and the special plates , where the spectroscopic targets were not chosen by the standard sdss target selection algorithms .",
    "the dr7 quasar catalog was constructed in three stages : 1 )  creation of a quasar candidate database , 2 )  visual examination of the spectra of the quasar candidates , and 3 )  application of luminosity and emission - line velocity width criteria .",
    "this approach is similar to that used in papers i - iv , but with minor modifications .",
    "this catalog of bona - fide quasars , that have redshifts checked by eye and luminosities and line widths that meet the formal quasar definition , is constructed from a larger ",
    "master \" table of quasar candidates and confirmed quasars .",
    "this master table was created using an sql query to the public sdss - dr7 database ( i.e. , the catalog archive server [ cas ] ; see thakar et al 2008 and http://cas.sdss.org/astrodr7/ ) .",
    "the vast majority of the objects in the master table were found from the union of four classes of objects : 1 )  those targeted , by either target or best , by the quasar selection algorithm ( gtr02 ) based upon their photometric or radio properties , 2 )  those whose spectra were classified by spectro1d as quasars ( specclass = qso or hiz_qso ) , 3 )  those whose spectra are classified as unknown by spectro1d , and 4 )  any object whose spectro1d redshift is larger than  0.6 .",
    "( there is of course considerable overlap between these categories . )",
    "the spectra in the third category often have low s / n or some glaring instrument - induced defects , but the set of unknown objects also include a considerable number of quasars that would have been missed by the other three selection criteria ( e.g. , extreme bals ; hall et al .",
    "the final category recovered the few quasars that were not selected by the gtr02 algorithm but whose spectra were misclassified by spectro1d , usually as galaxies",
    ". the lower redshift limit of criterion ( 4 ) was imposed because of the rapid rise in the number of objects as the redshift limit was decreased .",
    "a search of the specbs database found 112 quasars that had not been identified by the sql query ; these objects were added to the master quasar list .",
    "comparison of a preliminary master table to the 77,429 quasars included in paper  iv revealed that a small number of quasars were missing , mostly due to changes in adopted redshifts or classifications .",
    "the following subsets were added to the master table , using purely heuristic criteria designed to maximize the recovery of known missing objects while minimizing the inclusion of large numbers of objects that were not quasars .",
    "@xmath13  objects whose cross - correlation with quasar templates in the spectro1d processing yielded but for which the cas entry is a higher - confidence spectro1d redshift below  0.6 based upon fitting to emission lines , and with a confidence on that cross - correlation redshift which is at least  80% of the cas zconf value .    @xmath13  objects whose spectro1d emission - line redshift exceeded  0.6 , but for which the cas entry is a higher - confidence spectro1d redshift below  0.6 based upon cross - correlation with the quasar templates , and with a confidence on that emission - line cross - correlation redshift which is at least  80% of the cas zconf value .    @xmath13  objects at @xmath14 which have a emission line detected at @xmath15 significance with an observed linewidth ( fwhm ) of @xmath16 5.4  and a linewidth uncertainty of no more than 40% .",
    "@xmath13  one paper  iv quasar is not in the dr7 cas ( the  unmapped fiber \" object discussed in paper  iv ) ; information on this object , taken from paper  iv , was manually added to the master table .",
    "the final table contains information for 1,293,260 sources ] , of which 300,357 entries have spectroscopic observations .",
    "multiple entries for a given object are retained in the master table .",
    "the following culls were then applied to this database : 1 )  objects that were lacking spectra ( 992,903 entries ) , 2 )  objects whose photometric measurements have not been loaded into the cas , and thus luminosity calculations are impossible to perform ( 6383 ; 207 of these objects are indeed quasars and are described in appendix  a ) , 3 )  candidates that were classified by spectro1d as spec_star or spec_sky , with redshifts less than  0.002 , and had the redshift status flag set to either xcorr_emline , xcorr_hic , emline_xcorr , or emline_hic ( 48,712 ) , and 4 )  multiple spectra ( coordinate agreement better than  1.0@xmath3 ) of the same object  ( 65,632 ) .    before proceeding ,",
    "we should make a few brief comments on the last two items .",
    "ten of the paper  iv quasars were classified by the dr7 spectroscopic pipeline as stars with high confidence . in these individual cases",
    ", we overrode the automatic rejection and retained the quasars in the catalog .",
    "there are undoubtedly a few additional quasars residing in this large subset of confidently classified stars , but the effort required to visually examine the nearly 50,000 spectra was not deemed to be worth the miniscule return of quasars . in cases of duplicate spectra of an object ,",
    "the  science primary \" spectrum is selected ( i.e. , the spectrum was obtained as part of normal science operations ) ; when there is more than one science primary observation ( or when none of the spectra have this flag set ) , the spectrum with the highest s / n is retained ( see stoughton et al .",
    "2002 for a description of the science primary flag ) .",
    "these actions produced a list of  179,630 unique quasar candidates .",
    "given the considerable size of the dr7 quasar candidate list , our previous practice of visually examining every spectrum , irrespective of whether it had been reviewed for a previous edition of the catalog , was abandoned . only those objects whose dr7 spectra ( identified by the modified julian date of observation , plate number , and fiber number ) were not in the paper  iv list were by default reviewed ( 55,666 spectra ) .",
    "we also visually examined the spectra for the 1,224 quasars whose paper  iv redshifts differed by the dr7 spectro1d values by more than  0.03 .",
    "the sdss spectra of these quasar candidates were manually inspected by several of the authors ; as in previous papers in this series , we found that the spectroscopic pipeline redshifts and classifications of the overwhelming majority of the objects are accurate .",
    "the redshifts for 2671 of the quasar candidates were manually adjusted , usually by significant ( several tenths or more ) amounts ; the main cause for revision , as one would expect , was that spectro1d assigned the incorrect identification to emission features .",
    "the absolute magnitude limit for inclusion in the catalog is calculated by correcting the best @xmath8 psf magnitude measurement for galactic extinction ( using the maps of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis  1998 ) and assuming that the quasar spectral energy distribution in the ultraviolet - optical can be represented by a power law where @xmath6  =  @xmath17 ( vanden  berk et al .",
    "in the 20 cases where best @xmath8 photometry was unavailable , the target measurements were substituted for the absolute magnitude calculation .",
    "( there are 52 quasars that lack target photometry . )",
    "this approach ignores the contributions of emission lines and the observed distribution in continuum slopes to the photometric measurements .",
    "emission lines can contribute several tenths of a magnitude to the k - correction ( see richards et al .",
    "2006 ) , but since there is essentially no emission line contribution to the @xmath8 flux at zero redshift , our adopted approach will be inclusive ( i.e. , if one wishes to apply a k - correction for emission lines to construct a sample of objects with continuum luminosities greater than or equal to our luminosity cut will not have removed any objects that satisfy the emission - line k - corrected sample ) .",
    "quasars near the @xmath18  =  @xmath19 luminosity limit are often of similar brightness in the @xmath8-band as the starlight produced by the host galaxy . although the psf - based sdss photometric data presented in the catalog are less susceptible to host galaxy contamination than are fixed - aperture measurements , the nucleus of the host galaxy can still contribute appreciably to this measurement for the lowest luminosity entries in the catalog ( e.g. , hao et al .  2005 , bentz et al .",
    "2006 , croom et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the visual inspection and application of the luminosity criterion reduced the number of quasar candidates to under 106,000 objects . during the visual inspection we included all spectra that might possess at least one broad line , but no quantitative linewidth measurements were made . to remove narrow - line objects ,",
    "the spectra of the candidate quasars were examined with the principal component analysis ( pca ) code of boroson & lauer  ( 2010 ) .",
    "the pca analysis was done by constructing eigenspectra from approximately 1000 of the highest s / n spectra after rejecting the few narrow - lined objects in this subset .",
    "this procedure was applied separately to the 43005400    rest frame region of the 15,900 objects with @xmath20 and to the 24003200    rest frame region of the 55,400 objects with the spectra that could not be fit with a small number ( 15 ) of these eigenspectra were visually examined .",
    "almost all of the 120 rejects were narrow - line objects , with about 75% being seyfert  2s or liners , and the remainder were spectra with h  ii - region line ratios .",
    "we also examined the spectra of sources that were located near the highest concentration of narrow - line objects in the eigenspace ; this exercise identified a handful of additional objects to reject .",
    "this process also uncovered a few objects with incorrect redshifts , which we revised .",
    "several of the high - redshift ( @xmath21 ) quasar candidates have images that appear extended , as quantified by the difference between their psf and model magnitudes ( see , e.g. , the discussion in stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ; strauss et al .",
    "we examined in detail the spectra and images of all @xmath21 quasar candidates with @xmath22 band psf - model magnitudes greater than  0.2 mag .",
    "many of these objects are quasar - galaxy superpositions , and the sample includes previously known gravitational lenses ( e.g. , inada et al .",
    "2010 ; mcgreer et al .",

    "the following description applies to the standard ascii file .",
    "all files contain the same number of columns , but the storage of the numbers differs slightly in the ascii and fits formats ; the fits header contains all of the required documentation .",

    "six quasars have the two most luminous quasars have virtually identical absolute magnitudes ( @xmath24 and  @xmath25 ) : and    it has long been known that the majority of optically - selected quasars inhabit a restricted range in photometric color , and the large sample size and accurate photometry of the sdss revealed a tight color - redshift correlation for quasars ( richards et al",
    ".  2001 , 2003 , paper  iv ) .",
    "the modal relations for quasar colors in the four standard sdss colors as a function of redshift are given in paper  iv ; the differences between those values and the ones calculated from the dr7 sample are negligible .",
    "for each of the catalog quasars we provide the quantity @xmath26 , which is defined by    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the modal value of this color at the redshift of the quasar . this ",
    "differential color \" provides an estimate of the relative continuum slope of the quasar ( values above zero indicate that the object has a redder continuum than the typical quasar at that redshift ) .",
    "the distribution of @xmath26 near the modal curve is roughly symmetric , but the lower left panel in figure  5 reveals a significant population of  red \" quasars that has no  blue \" counterpart ( also see richards et al .  2003 and york et al .",
    "the usefulness of this measurement is compromised at redshifts above three because of the impact of the lyman  @xmath6 forest and lyman - limit systems in the observed @xmath29 photometry .",
    "these color - redshift relations have led to considerable success in assigning photometric redshifts to quasars ( e.g. , weinstein et al .",
    "2004 and references therein ) .",
    "a total of 8630 catalog objects are first ( becker , white , and helfand  1995 ) sources ( defined by a sdss - first positional offset of less than  2.0@xmath3 ) .",
    "note that 336 of the objects were selected ( with target ) solely because they were first matches .",
    "extended radio sources may be missed by this matching .",
    "the upper left panel in figure  6 contains a histogram of the angular offsets between the sdss and first positions ; the solid line is the expected distribution assuming a  0.20@xmath3 @xmath30 gaussian error in the relative sdss / first positions ( found by fitting only the points with a separation less than  1.0@xmath3 ) .",
    "the small - angle separations are well - fit to the rayleigh distribution , but outside of about  0.5@xmath3 there is an obvious excess of observed separations ; this large - separation tail is presumably due to sources with extended and/or complex radio emission .",
    "given the high astrometric accuracy of the sdss and first catalogs , the fraction of false matches is quite small ( on the order of  0.1% ; see paper  iv ) .",
    "matches with the _ rosat _ all - sky survey bright and faint source catalogs ( voges et al . 1999 , 2000 ) were made with a maximum allowed positional offset of  30@xmath3 ; this is similar to the 27.5@xmath3 positional coincidence required for the sdss _ rosat _ target selection code ( anderson et al .",
    "2003 ) . during the rosat all - sky survey phase",
    ", some regions in the sky received little or no exposure due to a malfunction of the satellite s attitude measuring and control system .",
    "these regions of the sky were reobserved  from 1997",
    "february  4 to february  26  by a set of 783 pointings ( the satellite had lost its capability to perform survey mode operations ) with typical exposures of 1500  s. approximately 2900 x - ray source detections were obtained in these fields ; 2708 are unique objects and are not contained in the bright and faint source catalogues of rosat .",
    "these supplemental sources were included in our _ rosat _ matching .",
    "the catalog contains  5377 rass matches ; approximately  1.3% are expected to be false identifications ( paper  iv ) .",
    "the sdss - rass offsets for these matches are presented in the upper right panel of figure  6 ; the solid curve , which is the rayleigh distribution for a @xmath30 positional error of  10.89@xmath3 ( fit using all the points ) , matches the data quite well .",
    "infrared photometric information for the quasars was provided by the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; skrutskie et al .",
    "the sdss quasar positions were compared to the 2mass all - sky and  6x \" point source catalogs using a matching radius of  2@xmath31 .",
    "( the 6x catalog covered a smaller area of sky six times deeper than the main survey . )",
    "if matches were found in both the all - sky and 6x catalogs , the information in the latter was selected for the quasar catalog . in the rare ( approximately  1.5% ) cases where this approach found more than one 2mass match for an sdss quasar in a given catalog ,",
    "the 2mass source with the smallest separation was adopted .",
    "this procedure identified 2mass photometry for 13,930 of the quasars .",
    "this approach is similar to , but slightly more extensive , than the 2mass matching in previous sdss quasar catalogs .",
    "since the 2mass catalogs represent only the most secure ( @xmath32 ) sources , and our object positions are known to considerable accuracy , it is possible to obtain additional information by extracting photometric data from the 2mass images themselves .",
    "we have performed standard aperture photometry ( @xmath33  radius ) on the 2mass images , following the procedure outlined in gallagher et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , and report all detections larger than 2@xmath34 in the quasar catalog .",
    "( the  2@xmath34 \" objects have the 2mass flag set to  2 \" in the quasar catalog . ) a total of 39,634 quasars had @xmath35 detections in at least one 2mass band , bringing the total number of objects in the catalog with infrared photometry to  53,564 . of the 1171 quasars with , almost all ( 1167 ) have a 2mass @xmath36-band detection .",
    "the offsets between the sdss and 2mass positions are shown in the lower left panel of figure  6 .",
    "only the matches with the 2mass catalog are displayed in the graph .",
    "the mechanical constraint that sdss spectroscopic fibers must be separated by  55@xmath3 on a given plate makes it difficult for the spectroscopic survey to confirm close pairs of quasars . in regions that are covered by more than one plate , however , it is possible to obtain spectra of both components of a close pair .",
    "there are  449 pairs of quasars in the catalog with angular separation less than an arcminute , of which 46 have angular separations less than 20@xmath3 .",
    "most of the pairs are chance superpositions , but there are many sets whose components have similar redshifts , suggesting that the quasars may be physically associated ( e.g. , hennawi et al",
    ".  2006 ) .",
    "the typical uncertainty in the measured value of the redshift difference between two quasars is  @xmath1  0.015 ; the catalog contains 27 quasar pairs with separations of less than an arcminute and these pairs , which are excellent candidates for binary quasars , are listed in table  4 .",
    "one of the pairs , and at a redshift of  3.3 and a separation of  1.7@xmath3 , is known to be a gravitational lens ( inada et al .",
    "the dr5 database is entirely contained in that of dr7 , but there are 181 quasars from paper  iv ( 0.17% ) that do not have a counterpart within  1.0@xmath3 of a dr7 quasar .",
    "( this fraction is similar to the 0.15% dropped between papers  iii and  iv . ) of the 181 , there are ten that are included in the dr7 list that match at larger offsets ; eight have matches within  2@xmath3 and the other two have separations of 2.0@xmath3 and  5.3@xmath3 .",
    "these ten separations are much larger than one would expect to find based on the 0.1@xmath3 rms scatter in the positions ; the large coordinate offsets presumably arise from different versions of the imaging pipeline software ( in particular the deblender ) .",
    "the majority of the dropped objects are low - redshift , low - luminosity sources ( @xmath1  80% have redshifts below one ) .",
    "most of the changes were introduced because 1 )  the spectra did not appear to satisfy our quasar criteria ( primarily the minimum line width limit ) based upon the pca analysis or 2 )  small changes in the photometric measurements dropped the luminosity below our absolute magnitude criterion .",
    "although the quasars in the catalog have been selected using a variety of techniques ( optical colors , radio properties , x - ray emission ) , the information contained in the catalog allows one to easily construct well - defined subsamples .",
    "for example , to construct an optically - selected set of quasars ( e.g. , strateva et al . 2005 ) , one can either require that the low - redshift or high - redshift target selection flag is set , or , alternatively , require that the object was not chosen solely by radio / x - ray criteria ( depending on whether or not you wish to have agn found by the serendipity , galaxy , or star algorithms ) , using the quantities in in the catalog .",
    "the primary purpose of this catalog is to compile all of the quasars discovered / recovered by the sdss survey in a complete and robust manner , allowing the general user to avoid the pitfalls that can arise from data mining such a large repository .",
    "all of the spectra have been inspected by eye , frequently by more than one of the authors .",
    "it may be that other users desire a more inclusive list of agns ; for example , by relaxing our cuts on luminosity or line width . in creating an expanded agn list , it is important to consider two important issues in terms of the compilation and statistical analysis of such samples .",
    "first , it is tempting to eliminate the labor - intensive visual examination stage and rely on the zconf flag as a means of restricting the agn sample to the most robust objects .",
    "however , zconf is not a good measure of the reliability of quasar redshifts : it depends strongly on redshift , as different emission lines enter and leave the sdss spectral coverage .",
    "for example , zconf drops dramatically in the mean from @xmath37 to @xmath38 as the h@xmath39 feature leaves the sdss spectral bandpass .",
    "the left panel of figure  7 shows zconf as a function of redshift for bona - fide quasars whose spectra have been confirmed by eye .",
    "the red histogram in the right panel in figure  7 demonstrates the result of applying an arbitrary cut , independent of redshift , to the dr7 quasar sample .",
    "the redshift dependence of zconf introduces an artificial apparent periodicity in the redshift distribution .",
    "the second issue has to do with the effects of emission lines on quasar photometry .",
    "the sdss quasar selection will include intrinsically fainter objects whenever a strong emission line enters the @xmath8 bandpass , making the quasar appear brighter than the same quasar at a redshift where the observed @xmath8 filter covers only continuum emission ( richards et al .",
    "when we restrict the sample to @xmath40 and correct for the emission line k - correction ( green histogram in figure  7 ) , the redshift distribution of the dr7 quasars is quite smooth .",
    "this is the final edition of the sloan digital sky survey  i and  ii quasar catalog , which was compiled from observations taken between  1999 and  2008 .",
    "one of the original stated goals of the sdss was to obtain spectra of 100,000 quasars , a total that has been met with this catalog .",
    "the lower right panel in figure  6 charts the progress of the sdss quasar survey , denoted by the number of spectroscopically - confirmed quasars as a function of time , over the duration of the project .    in the summer of 2008",
    "the third phase of the sdss , denoted as sdss - iii , began ; this survey is planned to be in operation for six years .",
    "one of the components of sdss - iii , the baryonic oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ; schlegel , white , & eisenstein 2009 ) , will use improved spectrographs on the sdss telescope to obtain spectra of 1.5 million luminous galaxies and over 100,000 quasars .",
