    "the discovery of topological insulator systems ( tis ) , both in three and in two dimensions , has recently attracted enormous attention @xcite .",
    "tis possess an insulating bulk gap and metallic edge or surface states , which can be distinguished from an ordinary band insulator by the existence of @xmath0 topological invariant@xcite .",
    "this exceptional property leads to quantum spin hall ( qsh ) effect which was first proposed for a model graphene system by kane and mele@xcite . as a specific example of two dimensional qsh system , a hgte / cdte quantum well ( qw ) with an inverted band structure has been demonstrated , experimentally and theoretically , to have a single pair of helical edge states in the qsh bar by the appearance of a quantized conductance plateau when the fermi energy lies in the bulk gap @xcite .",
    "quantized transport along the hgte boundaries can be conveniently explained by an edge channel picture : two states with opposite spin orientation propagate along opposite device edges in the same direction thus leading to a quantization@xcite of the conductance of @xmath1 . due to the spatial separation of the spin - states in these systems and to their one - dimensional ( 1d ) nature",
    ", system geometry and interference phenomena can be conveniently used for spin selections and hgte - based topological insulators appear to be promising candidates for spin processing devices .",
    "recent proposals of spin - transistors based on two - dimensional topological insulators rely on the application of a magnetic field at a pn - junction@xcite , aharonov - bohm and fabry - prot interferometers @xcite , and gating of a single hgte nanoconstriction @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate how topological edge states can be electrically switched in an elongated constriction leading to charge and spin transport with high fidelity .",
    "the physical mechanisms utilized here involve the coupling between topological edge states ( tess ) and the tunneling effects ( including spin - flip tunneling ) at the extremes of the constriction due to local etching .",
    "both the coupling between the tess and interference phenomena along the constriction can be controlled by all electrical gating and the present analysis sheds light on how manipulate edge - state transport in ti .",
    "+ in the following we introduce a 1d effective model . usually the qsh physics in hgte / cdte qw was studied by an effective 4-band model that depicts the inversion crossing of electron and hole band@xcite and most of the works have been based on the numerical solutions within a tight - binding method@xcite , while an analytical solution for the case of a finite strip geometry recently appeared @xcite .",
    "the transverse finite size effect is relevant because the edge states on the two sides can couple together to generate a gap in the spectrum even in the clean limit , breaking the edge channels .",
    "since a gap opens in the spectrum , differently from the quantum hall edge states which do not couple across the width of the strip , the application of electrical gate potentials can be exploited to shift the position of the electrochemical potential within the gap , thus permitting the switching of spin and charge transport .",
    "the transport properties of qsh systems in presence of an extended contact have been also considered in the interacting case both to extract information about the intensity of the interaction @xcite and to investigate the limit of extremely narrow constrictions @xcite .",

    "here we also present the model for the four terminal set - up and its operational configuration . in sec.[sec : scattering - field ] we introduce the scattering field approach and the basic formalism used to calculate spin and charge current in terms of the scattering matrix elements . in sec.[sec : results ] we show the results concerning charge and spin currents , mainly focussing on two specific configurations of the four terminal setup .",

    "the external leads the strip is characterized by a wide transverse dimension larger than the transverse decay length of the edge state wavefunction . here",
    "one can derive an effective dirac hamiltonian for the edge state @xmath4 ( @xmath5 being the pauli matrix ) in a single spin sub - block with a velocity @xmath6 which corresponds to the fermi velocity and energy offset @xmath7 which is in agreement with the full band structure in the vicinity of the band crossing @xcite . for decreasing width @xmath2 , i.e. along the constriction , the edge states at opposite boundaries start to overlap , leading to a mass like gap in the particles spectrum whose size is an exponentially decreasing function of the width @xmath8 , as explained in appendix [ app : appa ] , while @xmath9 is determined by the secular equation for the eigenvalues and depends on the distribution of the wavefunctions in space@xcite .",
    "additionally , one could also take into account the leading order spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) due to bulk or structure inversion asymmetry but the overlap of edge states due to both of them is negligibly small and is relevant only close to the avoided band crossing and for constrictions of width of several tens of nanometers ( @xmath10 nm ) .",
    "we can thus consider the following 1d effective hamiltonian for a kramers pairs edge states along the quantum well : @xmath11     and length @xmath3 , a finite overlap among the surface states allows the formation of a gap in the quasi - particle spectrum , while , close to the leads , states with different helicity are uncoupled .",

    "we investigated the electrical switching of charge and spin transport in a topological insulator nanoconstriction in a four terminal device by means of a scattering field theory .",
    "the spin and charge switch of the edge channels is caused by the coupling between edges states which overlap in the constriction and by the tunneling effects at the contacts of the quantum spin hall bar and therefore can be manipulated by tuning external applied gate voltages and by geometrical etching .",
    "we showed that the switching mechanism can be conveniently studied by electron interferometry involving the measurements of charge and spin currents in specific bias and gate configurations ( the switching probability is analyzed in the appendix [ app : appb ] ) .",
    "the device can operate in two gate configurations defined as : ( i ) @xmath14 ; ( ii ) @xmath15 , with side gates @xmath12 and @xmath13 . furthermore ,",
    "operating with the external dc bias @xmath110 , the device can work in the following configurations : ( i ) _ charge - bias _ ( cbc ) defined as @xmath16 , @xmath17 ; ( ii ) _ spin - bias _ ( sbc ) defined as @xmath18 , @xmath17 .",

    "the above behavior is peculiar for a gapped spectrum of the quasi - particles , while for large enough transverse dimension @xmath2 the maxima position does not depend on @xmath140 , as in the case of massless dirac particles .",
    "a similar behavior is also observed in the @xmath136 _ vs _ @xmath125 curves , where an oscillating dependence on the constriction length is present .",
    "the effect of @xmath140 on the transport properties is also evident in the sbc configuration .",

    "however , the spin current is strongly dependent on the spin - flipping tunneling value at the etching points @xmath142 . in particular",

    "this behavior can be understood observing that the fabry - prot phase @xmath183 responsible for the gate modulation of @xmath136 is zero . on the other hand , the @xmath136 _ vs _ @xmath125 curves present a behavior similar to the one observed in the gate configuration ( i ) .",

    "indeed , using the external gates , it is possible to tune the spin current from @xmath186 ( @xmath187 ) up to @xmath188 ( @xmath189 ) , being this effect relevant for spintronics .",
    "moreover , the @xmath151 _ vs _ @xmath125 curves present a quantum beating - like structure caused by the presence of two ( non - commensurate ) periods of oscillation , namely @xmath190 .",
    "finally , there exist special values of @xmath125 for which the spin current is independent from @xmath44 ( see fig.[fig : fig12 ] ) .",
    "+ in conclusion , we have shown that the electrical switching behavior offers an efficient and robust mechanism to manipulate topological edge states transport exploiting a four terminal set - up relevant for spintronics applications . furthermore , going beyond the technological implications , our analysis can be used to unveil the effects of a non - vanishing effective mass on the transport properties of confined dirac fermions .",
    "within the constriction ( @xmath42 ) , the equation of motion of @xmath191 is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath192 where for generality , we assume that apart from the term ( [ eq : coupling ] ) a term with spin - flipping coupling of the form ( [ eq : spin - flip ] ) with constant amplitude @xmath193 is also present : @xmath194 \\psi(x),\\ ] ] with @xmath195 . considering constrictions whose transverse dimension @xmath2 allows edge states coupling , the functional form of the coupling@xcite is @xmath196 ( see fig.[fig : fig13 ] ) , while the flipping term @xmath45 can be neglected for not too tight and not too long constrictions . as also evident from ref .",
    "[ ] , the spin precession induced by a very weak value of the spin - orbit interaction assumes a relevant role in the transport only for very long constrictions characterized by @xmath197 nm which are quite long to maintain coherent transport .",
    "this comes from the fact that a slow spin precession needs a very long time ( and thus a long distance ) to completely change the spin polarization of a particle traveling along the system .",
    "in particular , a spin precession described by an angular frequency @xmath198 requires a time @xmath199 to completely flip the electron spin , while the dwell time @xmath200 required to cover the constriction length @xmath3 is given by @xmath201 .",
    "the above condition implies that the shortest constriction length to observe a complete spin flipping fulfills the relation @xmath202 . as a consequence , weak values of the spin orbit coupling ( and thus small values of @xmath198 ) require longer constrictions .",
    "motivated by these arguments , in this work we assume @xmath203 m and set @xmath204 along the constriction , which is equivalent to neglect the spin - orbit coupling , while we consider spin - flipping tunneling @xmath44 at the etching points @xmath102 .     on w as deduced from ref . [ ] , the interpolation formula being @xmath196 , with @xmath205 mev and @xmath206 nm@xmath207.,title=\"fig : \" ] +",
    "in this appendix we show how topological edge states can be selectively switched in the nanoconstriction . in fig.[fig : fig14 ] are shown the transition probabilities for an incoming spin - polarized state at the upper edge ( terminal 2 ) to be reflected back to the lower edge ( terminal 1 ) , transmitted through the constriction in the same spin and edge state ( terminal 3 ) or transmitted by swapping the edge and simultaneously flipping the spin ( terminal 4 ) . by using the parameters @xmath147 , @xmath119 , @xmath153 ( as given in fig.[fig : fig6 ] ) , and fixing the electrochemical potential at the bottom of the conduction band , one observes that transmission from a state up to a state down in terminal 4 is activated for longer nanoconstriction channels and higher values of the local spin flipping tunneling at the point contacts ( see right down panel ) , while for lower values of @xmath44 transmission along the same edge and spin state is favored for longer channels ( see panel right up ) .     from the injection lead 2 ( @xmath208 ) to the arrival",
    "lead @xmath209 .",
    "the parameters are fixed as done in fig.[fig : fig6 ] ( @xmath147 , @xmath119 , @xmath153 ) , while the values of @xmath125 and @xmath44 are specified by the column / row labels .",
    "notice the resonant transmission regime , characterized by @xmath210 , obtained by fixing the constriction length @xmath133.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    for intermediate values of @xmath44 both reflection to the lower edge in the same spin state and transmission along the channel in terminal 3 and 4 takes place , the latter having almost equal probabilities ( see middle panels ) . since the spin - flipping tunneling is controlled by the local modification of the spin - orbit interaction by geometrical etching , our device can be used as spin transistor with high fidelity .",
    "let us note that differently from ref .",
    "[ ] , here spin precession along the channel does not take place and is not relevant for this setup .",
