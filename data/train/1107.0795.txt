    "we introduced irregularities consisting of zigzag edges along the armchair edge of the ribbon .",

    "[ fig : dc_mix](a ) .",

    ", we assume that the length of the nanoribbon is 40 nm , @xmath198 mev , and @xmath61 ev . ]    because a small segment of the zigzag edge about 1 nm in length creates a zero - energy edge state in the energy spectrum ,  @xcite it is reasonable to consider that the z peak is relevant to the edge state caused by the irregularity .",
    "moreover , the reduction in the peak intensity at 0.66 ev suggests that the optical transition from the edge state to the state at the band edge of the first subband is activated .",
    "this consideration is consistent with the fact that the z peak position ( 0.4 ev ) is approximately half of the energy band gap of the pure armchair nanoribbon ( 0.66/2 ev ) .",
    "an interesting point here is that the edge state existing near the zigzag irregularity can contribute to the optical transition , on the other hand , the edge state in pure zigzag nanoribbons does not .",
    "that is , the edge state near a zigzag irregularity is not identical to the edge state in a pure zigzag nanoribbon .",
    "for a pure zigzag nanoribbon , the edge atoms at @xmath39 are all a - atoms , while those at @xmath199 are all b - atoms [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : zig](a ) ] . as a result",

    "note that these edge states have an amplitude only on the a - atoms or b - atoms depending on the edge atom . since the electron - light matrix element is proportional to the matrix element of @xmath203 or @xmath204 ,",
    "the matrix elements with respect to the pseudospin polarized edge states vanish as @xmath205 one might consider that the matrix element of @xmath66 between the edge state localized at @xmath39 and that localized at @xmath199 can be non - zero because @xmath206 however , such matrix elements are also strongly suppressed because @xmath207 is satisfied and there is little spatial overlap between the two edge states .",
    "therefore , the edge state in a pure zigzag nanoribbon does not contribute to the optical transition .",
    "by contrast , the edge atoms of the zigzag irregularity include equal numbers of a - atoms and b - atoms , and the a- and b - edge atoms are close in space .",
    "thus , the edge state at the a - edge atoms [ @xmath208 can interfere with the other edge state at the b - atoms [ @xmath209 to form a new edge state pair [ @xmath210 .",
    "this feature of the interference between two sublattices is essential to the optical transition .",
    "this consideration is consistent with the result shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dc_mix](b ) , where the intensity of the z peak decreases when the zigzag edge part consists only of one sublattice .",
    "@xcite note also that the inter - band transition @xmath211 for the edge states contributes to the absorption spectrum at zero - energy ( @xmath212 ) as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : dc_mix](c ) .",
    "the irregularities do not result in a notable change of the absorption spectrum .",
    "this feature can be rationalized by using the fact that the armchair edge does not change the pseudospin via the reflection of the incident electron wave [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : armwf - rec ] ) ] .",
    "the numerical results presented in this section suggest that for a defective armchair nanoribbon , the absorption spectrum of transversely ( @xmath76 ) polarized light is robust against the presence of irregularities , while the absorption spectrum of low - energy longitudinally ( @xmath88 ) polarized light is sensitive to them . for a defective zigzag nanoribbon , the absorption spectrum appears insensitive to the irregularities .",
    "the optical selection rule of armchair nanoribbons reminds us of the optical selection rule of single - wall carbon nanotubes ( swnts ) .",
    "@xcite the selection rule of swnts shows that light polarized parallel ( perpendicular ) to the axis results in a direct ( indirect ) inter - band transition satisfying @xmath86 ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "it is known that the indirect transition originates from the cylindrical topology of swnts .",
    "although the indirect transition is interesting , the corresponding absorption peak is suppressed by the depolarization effect .",
    "@xcite indeed , the experimental results for swnts do not show absorption peaks relevant to the indirect inter - band transition .",
    "this is consistent with the presence of a depolarization field .",
    "@xcite while the topology of nanoribbons is quite different from that of swnts , there is a possibility that a depolarization field suppresses the absorption of the @xmath76-polarized light for armchair nanoribbons .",
    "the selection rule for zigzag nanoribbons is distinct from that for armchair nanoribbons , and the zigzag nanoribbons seem to be anomalous with respect to the depolarization effect .",
    "the depolarization field points along the @xmath88-axis , which is orthogonal to the direction of the polarization of the incident light .",
    "the optical transition between two subbands @xmath44 and @xmath213 depends on changes in the wavenumber @xmath0 ( @xmath214 ) and the pseudospin @xmath215 .",
    "these factors @xmath0 and @xmath215 could be treated independently in a discussion of the optical transitions for armchair nanoribbons . on the other hand , the factors mix and",
    "can not be treated independently for zigzag nanoribbons .",
    "the pseudospin can be changed by interactions that are not included in our analysis .",
    "for example , a potential difference between the a and b sublattices is induced by the stack in the bernal configuration and gives rise to a polarization of pseudospin for the states near the dirac point .",
    "@xcite furthermore , the pseudospin can be related to real spin because the edge states in zigzag nanoribbons are prone to be spin polarized if we take into account the coulomb interaction .",
    "@xcite although the selection rules that we have obtained provide the basis for exploring the optical phenomena exhibited by graphene nanoribbons , it is possible that these interactions modify the absorption peaks present in this paper .",
    "we have paid considerable attention to the indirect optical transitions satisfying @xmath170 .",
    "an inter - band transition with @xmath170 is induced when the polarization of the incident light is perpendicular ( parallel ) to the armchair ( zigzag ) edge , while an intra - band indirect transition is induced when the light polarization is perpendicular to both the armchair and zigzag edges .",
