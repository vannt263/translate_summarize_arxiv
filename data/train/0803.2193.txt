    "electrons in semiconductor superlattices ( sls ) exhibit a wide range of nonlinear effects that are of fundamental scientific interest and useful for applications in ultrafast electronics @xcite .",
    "many of these effects originate from the sl minibands , which enable electrons to perform thz frequency bloch oscillations when a sufficiently high static electric field is applied along the sl axis @xcite .",
    "bloch oscillations cause the electron drift velocity to decrease with increasing electric field , which can trigger charge - domain oscillations accompanied by the emission of electromagnetic radiation @xcite .",
    "the frequency response of sl oscillators and detectors is limited by scattering processes including electron - phonon interactions @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , though , phonons can serve as a powerful tool for _ enhancing _ the electronic and optical properties of solid state devices @xcite .",
    "for example , in ` saser ' sls @xcite , analogous to the laser , the amplification of coherent sound waves now opens the way to acoustic control of miniband electron transport . in related work",
    ", we recently demonstrated that a train of acoustic strain pulses can induce current in a sl by dragging miniband electrons through the device @xcite .    in this paper , we show that a continuous ghz acoustic wave can create complex thz electron dynamics in sls , thus producing high - frequency current oscillations even when no static electric field is applied . in a single - electron picture , there are two distinct dynamical regimes , depending on whether the energy amplitude , @xmath0 , of the acoustic wave is greater , or less , than a critical value , @xmath1 , which depends on the sl parameters . for @xmath2 ,",
    "the acoustic wave drags electrons through the sl , producing , in the presence of electron scattering , a drift velocity , @xmath3 , far higher than the speed of the wave itself . in this regime ,",
    "the electrons perform periodic orbits in the rest frame of the acoustic wave .",
    "the orbital frequencies are more than an order of magnitude higher than the sound wave frequency . when @xmath4 , the acoustic wave no longer drags electrons through the sl .",
    "instead , there is an abrupt onset of bloch - oscillation bursts , which makes @xmath3 decrease extremely rapidly with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "our results demonstrate that miniband electrons driven by a ghz acoustic wave can attain a higher maximal @xmath3 , and have a larger negative differential velocity ( ndv ) , than when they are accelerated by a _",
    "static _ electric field .",
    "since high - frequency sl oscillators require high values of both parameters @xcite , acoustic wave driving could strongly enhance the performance of such devices . to investigate how the sudden onset of single - particle bloch oscillations affects the collective dynamics of the electrons , we solve the poisson and ( drift - diffusion ) current - continuity equations self - consistently throughout the sl .",
    "we use our results to determine the current through the sl as a function of @xmath0 and time .",
    "remarkably , the current exhibits self - sustained high - frequency oscillations for all @xmath0 . for @xmath5 ,",
    "these oscillations originate from space - charge density waves , created and dragged through the sl by the acoustic wave . in this regime ,",
    "as @xmath0 increases the space - charge modulation strengthens , and so the amplitude of the current oscillations also increases .",
    "but when @xmath0 increases above @xmath1 , the onset of bloch oscillations localises the electrons , thereby weakening the current oscillations .",
    "this electron localisation also leads to the formation of propagating charge domains , which coexist with the charge density waves .",
    "the complex single - particle and collective electron dynamics induced by an acoustic wave demonstrate the potential of sls for interfacing high - frequency electronics with the emerging field of phononics @xcite , which is attracting considerable interest in applied physics and engineering .",
    "in particular , our results indicate that sls can be used to both detect and up - convert an applied acoustic signal .",
    "generic features of the energy band transport processes created by a propagating wave potential also suggest ways to control transport through other spatially - periodic systems , including cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : sec1 ] , we introduce the semiclassical equations of motion for a miniband electron in the presence of an acoustic wave and show that the electron dynamics and drift velocity depend critically on the wave amplitude . in section [ sec : sec2 ] , we consider the collective electron dynamics and show that the acoustic wave triggers linear charge density waves , nonlinear charge domains ( when @xmath4 ) , and self - sustained current oscillations even for very small wave amplitudes .",
