    "tidal tails form during the interaction between galaxies , and are composed of stars , gas , and dust ejected from the original galactic disks .",
    "these interactions are often accompanied by one or more bursts of star and cluster formation in the main bodies of the parent galaxies , according to simulations ( e.g. , mihos , bothun , & richstone 1993 ) and observations of star clusters ( e.g. , whitmore & schweizer 1995 ) .",
    "the star cluster formation processes that occur within tidal tails , however , are not well understood .",
    "for example , building on pioneering work by knierman et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , mullan et al .",
    "( 2011 ; hereafter m11 ) used v and @xmath3 band photometry from wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) to measure the brightness and colors of point - like sources both in and out of the tail region for 23 tidal tails .",
    "they found a statistically significant number of clusters in 10 out of their 23 tails , and they concluded that the presence of tail clusters depends on several factors , including tail age , density , and surface brightness of the tail . in this work",
    "we revisit two of these tails using higher quality data taken with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on _ hst_/wide field camera ( wfc ) and detect clusters in both of them for the first time .",
    "even less is known about the ages of star clusters in tidal tails .",
    "de grijs et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found @xmath4 clusters each in the tadpole galaxy with rough ages of @xmath5 myr and in the mice galaxies ( ngc 4676 ) with ages @xmath6 myr .",
    "most of these clusters appear to have formed in the tails since their estimated ages are younger than those of the tails ; de grijs et al . estimated a dynamical age of @xmath7 myr for the tadpole , and privon et al .",
    "( 2013 ) suggested a formation time of @xmath8 myr ago for the mice .",
    "tran et al . also observed the tadpole galaxy , and found 42 extremely young tail clusters ( @xmath9 myr ; 2003 ) .",
    "bastian et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found young massive star clusters in the tails of ngc 6872 and was able to estimate ages and masses for individual clusters using @xmath10 and h@xmath11 photometry .",
    "no star clusters older than the dynamical age of the tidal tail were found ( at least down to their completeness limit of @xmath12 ) , once again suggesting that the clusters formed from the tidal debris .",
    "they also found a large population of clusters that are very young ( @xmath13 myr ) . while looking for spatial trends , bastian et al . found that older tail clusters tend to be located closer to the main bodies , while younger clusters are spread throughout the tail .",
    "they argue that these findings suggest an initial burst of cluster formation as the tails form . after this burst ,",
    "as the tails expand , the gas clouds cool and condense , eventually becoming sites of individual cluster formation .    while tidal tails provide a unique and interesting environment to study star clusters",
    ", they also provide key information for improving simulations of interacting / merging galaxies .",
    "efforts to reproduce mergers using simulations focus on tidal tail morphology to constrain details of the galaxy interaction .",
    "ages of star clusters in tails provide constraints on the merger timescale .",
    "the spatial distributions of clusters in the main bodies and tails helps to discriminate between different prescriptions for star formation within the simulations .",
    "for example , dynamical models of the interacting system ngc 7252 show that density - dependent star formation results in a more centrally concentrated distribution of main - body clusters , while shock - induced star formation tends to spread cluster formation throughout the galaxy , including in the tails ( chien & barnes 2010 ) .",
    "the goal of this work is to better understand how clusters form and are distributed during the merging of two galaxies .",
    "we focus our study on three merging systems , ngc 520 , ngc 2623 , and ngc 3256 .",
    "this paper is set up in the following manner . in section 2",
    "we discuss the observations and photometry , as well as cluster selection .",
    "section 3 presents the cluster densities and cluster luminosity functions , as well as colors and ages of clusters and of the diffuse light . in section 4",
    "we discuss the galaxy merger history and interpret our results .",

    "figure [ diffuse_ccd ] reveals that the northern tail of ngc 520 has the reddest diffuse light of any tail in our sample .",
    "this is likely due to dust , as the red @xmath15 color in figure [ diffuse ] extends from the main body straight through the tail .",
    "region a in the southern tail is also almost certainly affected by dust .",
    "we believe that the colors of the diffuse light in the other regions of the southern tail are dominated by ages of the underlying populations and not extinction because of the absence of dust lanes in this tail .",
    "these regions have an age @xmath16 of around 800 myr .    in ngc 2623 ,",
    "most of the regions in the north tail have colors consistent with stellar populations of @xmath17 myr old .",
    "region nc , however , is bluer and yields an age of @xmath18 myr .",
    "we note that the diffuse light in the pie wedge ( region p ) has @xmath19 and @xmath20 colors close to region nc , as seen in table [ tab : diffuse ] , which might provide clues to its formation , as we discuss further in section 4.1.2 .",
    "figure [ diffuse_ccd ] shows that the diffuse light in ngc 3256 is perhaps the most peculiar of our sample .",
    "only region ec falls near the bc06 track , with an associated age @xmath21 myr .",
    "this would indicate that the diffuse light population in region ec is similar to the majority of the diffuse populations in the tails of ngc 2623 .",
    "it would be plausible that region ec falls on a local region of enhanced star formation , causing its diffuse light colors to be bluer than other regions of ngc 3256e .",
    "however , region ec does not include any young star clusters , instead containing only one cluster whose colors suggest that it predates the merger .",
    "the rest of the regions we measured are gathered around @xmath22 and @xmath23 and are off the bc06 track .",
    "regardless , these offset colors suggest faint population ages of about 800  1000 myr . it is likely that most of these diffuse light regions do not have colors consistent with the bc06 track because of the low surface brightness of ngc 3256e , resulting in large photometric errors . it is unlikely that h@xmath11 line emission could be responsible for the offset from the model , although this emission would move measurements in the observed direction relative to the models , because such recent star formation is usually quite bright and lumpy .",
    "the age of the tidal tails , which we define as @xmath24 , refers to the time since perigalacticon of the two progenitor galaxies , because they form from material ejected after the galaxies undergo their closest approach .",
    "the ages of tails can be estimated from simulations and are probably accurate to within @xmath25 ( @xmath26 myr ; barnes & hibbard 2009 ) . in this section ,",
    "we briefly summarize previous simulations of our sample of mergers , and we compare tail ages from those simulations with our measured cluster ages .",

    "we find that , for most systems , there is a period of increased cluster formation near the time that the tidal tails formed .",
    "we quantify the time of this cluster formation ( hereafter denoted @xmath28 ) by comparing the density peak of the color distribution with cluster evolution model predictions .",
    "these density plots are shown in the right panels of figure [ dens_ccd ] .",
    "contours are plotted , and the density peak is marked with a circle .",
    "the colors of the peak are then compared with a bc06 track to obtain an age ( shown in left panels of figure [ dens_ccd ] ) .",
    "the interaction history of ngc 520 is the least well understood of our sample .",
    "stanford & balcells ( 1991 ) ran the most recent simulation of the system , comparing to infrared and optical images , as well the velocity field .",
    "their best match to these observations are at a simulated age of @xmath29 300 myr ago .",
    "the system is particularly complicated , however , because stanford & balcells find that their simulations were not fully consistent with two colliding disk galaxies , due to the presence of a third dwarf galaxy , ugc 957 .",
    "they conclude that the southern tail formed from the interaction of two massive disk galaxies and that the northern tail is the result of a passage by ugc 957 . if the two tails formed via different interactions , we might expect differences in their cluster ages . despite these complexities ,",
    "we adopt a best guess of @xmath30 myr .",
    "the northern tail of ngc 520 contains only three young clusters , making a color density plot impractical here .",
    "however , the three clusters are tightly grouped around 100 myr on the bc06 track ; we therefore approximate their ages to be @xmath31 myr .",
    "the majority of the south tail clusters appear to be older , and , based on their color distribution in figure [ dens_ccd ] , they are consistent with a period of cluster formation that began around @xmath32 myr ago .    the differences in the numbers and ages of the clusters detected in the north and south tails appear to be consistent with the scenario put forth by stanford & balcells .",
    "the passage of a dwarf galaxy would not necessarily result in a starburst as intense as one resulting from two equal - mass galaxies , because the dwarf galaxy would strip less gas to form clusters .",
    "we detect many more clusters in the southern tail , which stanford & balcells predict is the result of a disk - disk interaction , than the northern tail , which likely formed from the passage of the dwarf galaxy ugc 957 .",
    "stanford & balcells speculate that the dwarf galaxy might have formed the northern tail as the disks were interacting , around the same time the southern tail was forming",
    ". however , the tight age grouping of the three clusters in ngc 520n seems to indicate that cluster formation took place earlier than in ngc 520s .",
    "privon et al .",
    "( 2013 ) simulated ngc 2623 and estimated that an age @xmath33 myr best reproduces spatial and kinematic distributions of .",
    "privon et al .",
    "also successfully recreated the pie wedge region , showing that it is probably material from the northern tail that has fallen back through the main body and is currently on a southward trajectory .",
    "we measure clusters in ngc 2623n to have a peak density in color corresponding to an age of @xmath34 myr ; this supports the scenario that cluster formation began at the same time that the tail formed .",
    "there are some clusters that appear to be older than the tail , however , as we discussed in section 3.3.1 , we believe this is due to photometric scatter resulting from low s / n .",
    "ngc 2623s possesses too few clusters to reliably measure @xmath28 , although it is clear from figure [ clus_ccd ] that most of the clusters are slightly bluer than the color associated with the tail age .",
    "it is possible that formation of clusters in the south tail was somewhat delayed relative to the tail itself , but uncertainties in tail and cluster ages are too large to definitively establish such a delay .",
    "inspection of figures [ clus_ccd ] and [ dens_ccd ] shows that clusters in the pie wedge have a very narrow range of colors , suggesting that they all formed at approximately the same time ; we measure @xmath28 to be @xmath35 myr .",
    "these clusters are clearly bluer and hence younger than clusters in the tails of ngc 2623 .",
    "this result is consistent with the scenario proposed by evans et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , where the pie wedge formed from debris from the inner region of the northern tail .",
    "they suggest that the debris fell back through the main body , inducing a burst of star formation ( see also privon et al .",
    "2013 ) . while privon et al .",
    "do not provide an age for the pie wedge , their figure 8 shows snapshots of the merger at different times . at 85",
    "myr ago , the debris can be seen falling southward , past the main body , roughly consistent with our cluster formation timescale .",
    "recent unpublished results from simulations place ngc 3256 at @xmath36 myr ( g. privon , private communication ) .",
    "the simulation is based on spatial and kinematic images of the system and was run using the same methodology as for ngc 2623 .",
    "clusters in the eastern tail have the largest spread in color of any system in our sample , with a weak density peak , @xmath37 myr .",
    "this suggests a longer duration of cluster formation in this tail .",
    "these ages are consistent with previous results .",
    "trancho et al .",
    "( 2007 ) obtained spectroscopic ages for three clusters in the western tail , and found two clusters with ages of @xmath29 80 myr , and a third with an estimated age of @xmath29 230 myr .",
    "the latter fits well within the range that we find for clusters in the eastern tail .      in the three systems studied here",
    ", we have found that cluster formation typically begins with the tidal tail formation , although in a few cases a delay can not be ruled out .",
    "this type of delay was also found by bastian et al .",
    "( 2005 ) in ngc 6872 .",
    "we therefore conclude that , in general , @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 myr clusters have not formed in any of the tails studied here .",
    "we confirm this by examining _",
    "h@xmath11 images of the two most recent mergers , ngc 2623 and ngc 520 , and find no h@xmath11 emission in any of their tails .",
    "we speculate that either the tails have used up their gas , or , because the gas is not collisionless , most of the remaining gas was largely dispersed during the interaction .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that clusters with age @xmath39 myr have been reported in the tidal tails of the tadpole galaxy and ngc 6872 ( tran et al .",
    "2003 ; bastian et al .",
    "2005 ) . in the case of ngc 6872 ,",
    "the time since tail formation is @xmath40 myr ( horellou & koribalski 2003 ) , making ngc 6872 significantly younger than any interacting system in our sample ( except for the pie wedge ) .",
    "it is possible that ngc 6872 has simply not yet dispersed its tidal tail gas , resulting in newly formed clusters .",
    "based on our cluster age distributions , we suggest the following scenario : initially , the progenitor galaxies form clusters at a lower , approximately constant rate .",
    "once the two galaxies begin their interaction , many of these disk clusters , along with other disk material , are stripped and form the tidal tails .",
    "the stripped gas typically begins forming clusters immediately , resulting in an increased rate of cluster formation .",
    "the process continues in the tails at a lower rate until the gas reservoir is exhausted or the gas is dispersed .",
    "we suggest the following sequence of merger ages : ngc 2623 is the most recent of the three mergers , followed by ngc 520 , with ngc 3256 being the oldest .",
    "this sequence is supported by both our estimated cluster ages and simulated ages of tidal tails ( and thus ages of the mergers themselves ) .",
    "we note that the age sequence suggested by these simulations is different than what the toomre sequence suggests , as ngc 520 and ngc 2623 are flipped ( toomre 1977 ) .",
    "we find that clusters in the pie wedge have ages around @xmath41 myr .",
    "the north tail of ngc 2623 contains clusters with ages at @xmath34 myr , while the few south tail clusters are slightly younger , although we do not attempt to quantify their ages .",
    "ngc 520 , the next youngest merger , exhibits a slight age difference among clusters in different tails .",
    "ngc 520n has clusters around @xmath41 myr , while ngc 520s clusters has @xmath32 myr .",
    "the oldest merger , ngc 3256 , contains clusters in the eastern tail with ages @xmath37 myr , although we caution that the broad age distribution in ngc 3256e suggests that cluster formation likely began earlier than 260 myr ago . for a direct comparison ,",
    "all the values of @xmath24 and @xmath28 are listed in table [ tab : clusters ] .",
    "we have measured the lfs for all tails where possible , and find tentative evidence that younger mergers exhibit shallower lfs , although our sample size is small .",
    "m11 found that a lf with @xmath42 provided qualitatively acceptable fits to their statistically determined cluster sample in tails where the measurement was possible , although they were not able to directly fit the lf with a power law due to the poor quality of the data .",
    "whitmore et al .",
    "( 2014 ) measured the luminosity function in a variety of spiral galaxies in search of various correlations between @xmath11 and galactic environment .",
    "a weak negative correlation was found between star formation rate ( sfr ) and @xmath11 ( i.e. galaxies with high sfr tend to have flatter lfs ) .",
    "for instance , the antennae , a major merger with a relatively high sfr , had the second lowest @xmath11 value in their sample , at @xmath43 .",
    "no measurements of the cluster lf were made in tidal tails , however . while @xmath11 tends to decrease with the tail age , all @xmath11 values in our sample are within the range observed in a wide variety of other environments ( whitmore et al .",
    "2014 and references therein ) .",
    "we have used acs / wfc observations from _ hst _ to directly observe star clusters in the tidal tails of three nearby mergers .",
    "we draw the following conclusions .    1 .",
    "every tidal tail in our sample , as well as the pie wedge , contains a population of star clusters .",
    "we note that ngc 520n and ngc 3256e were reported to have no statistically significant cluster presence in m11 .",
    "we estimated the ages of clusters in each tidal tail and compared with estimated ages for the tails themselves from simulations .",
    "the tidal tails in ngc 2623 contain a population of clusters which appear to have formed during the formation of the tails .",
    "tails of ngc 520 and ngc 3256 possess several clusters that appear to predate the merger , in addition to a population of clusters that formed at , or soon after the formation of the tails .",
    "3 .   in every tidal tail in our sample , cluster formation lasted for several tens of millions of years , but no very recent formation ( in the last few million years ) has occurred in any of the tails .",
    "simulations place the formation of tails in the following sequence , from youngest to oldest : the pie wedge , ngc 2623 , ngc 520 , ngc 3256 .",
    "ages obtained from clusters generally agree with this sequence .",
    "the diffuse light in the tails of ngc 520 and ngc 2623 exhibits a gradient in color across the tail ( as opposed to along it ) , which is likely indicative of systematic patterns in the ages of the diffuse stellar population . to our knowledge , such color gradients in the diffuse stellar light in tidal tails of these galaxies has not been previously reported .",
    "the gradient is loosely traced by the spatial distribution of young and old star clusters within the tail .",
    "we interpret this gradient as a superposition of broadly distributed older stellar material and younger stars and clusters that formed along the center of the tail , where gas is densest .",
    "the lfs of clusters in our tidal tail sample are similar to those found in a variety of galactic environments .",
    "we tentatively find that as the merger age increases , the luminosity function tends to become steeper .",
