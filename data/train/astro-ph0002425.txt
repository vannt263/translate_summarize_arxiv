    "observations of galaxies in the rest frame uv band ( @xcite1996 ; @xcite1996 ; @xcite1997 ; @xcite  1997 ; @xcite1998 ; @xcite  1998 ) indicate that the galaxy formation rate rises steeply from @xmath7 to @xmath8 , with a nearly constant rate thereafter up to @xmath9 ( @xcite1999 ) . while at low redshift ( @xmath10 ) the evolution of luminous quasar abundance resembles that of luminous galaxies ( e.g. , sanders & mirabel 1996 ; boyle & terlevich 1998 ) , at high redshift ( @xmath11 ) the two classes of objects do not seem to parallel one another , with the luminous quasar formation rate ( e.g. , warren 1994 ; schmidt 1995 ) dropping off more steeply than that of luminous galaxies .    in this _",
    "a phenomenological approach is taken to relate the _ observed _ formation rate of luminous lbgs to the _ observed _ abundance evolution of luminous quasars at @xmath11 .",
    "it is shown that , _ if 1 ) quasar activity is triggered by lbg mergers _ and _ 2 ) each quasar period lasts @xmath12yrs _ , then the apparent difference , _ in both shape and amplitude _ , between the evolutions of bright lbgs and bright quasars from @xmath13 to @xmath14 can be explained quantitatively .",
    "the first assumption finds its support from both the observational evidence that a significant fraction of quasar hosts have disturbed morphologies or ongoing galaxy - galaxy interactions ( e.g. , boyce 1996 ; bahcall 1997 ; boyce , disney , & bleaken 1999 ) and the theoretical consideration that merger of two ( spiral ) galaxies seems to provide a natural mechanism to fuel the central black hole ( e.g. , barnes & hernquist 1991 ) .",
    "the second assumption is also theoretically well motivated ( rees 1984 , 1990 ) and now strongly implied or required by the mounting observational evidence that most nearby massive galaxies seem to harbor inactive black holes at their centers ( e.g. , richstone 1998 ) .    the primary purpose of this work is to use this merger model to infer the lbg formation rate at higher redshift @xmath5 . given the precipitous drop - off of luminous quasar ( @xmath15 ) abundance from @xmath13 to @xmath16 the formation rate of luminous ( @xmath17 to @xmath18 ) lbgs at higher redshift ( @xmath5 ) is predicted to drop off as least as fast as @xmath19 , if the merger scenario holds . a cosmological model with @xmath20 and hubble constant @xmath21km / sec / mpc",
    "is assumed for the analysis presented here .",
    "it is noted that this simple merger model would probably fail at @xmath10 without having taken into account the evolution of gaseous fuel supply to the central black holes in galaxies ( kauffmann & haehnelt 1999 ; haiman & menou 1999 ) .",
    "denoting @xmath22 as the galaxy formation rate ( galaxy formation per unit time per unit comoving volume ) as a function of redshift , then the ( cumulative ) number density of formed galaxies ( number of galaxies per unit comoving volume ) is ( ignoring the small fraction of galaxies that merge ) @xmath23 for simplicity @xmath24 will be assumed , which should be a good approximation at high redshift ( @xmath11 ) for the range of cosmological models of current interest ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the merger rate for a galaxy with an internal one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath26 in a cluster / group with galaxy number density @xmath27 ( assuming all galaxies under consideration are identical ) and one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath28 has been computed by makino & hut ( 1997 , equation 33 ) to be : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a dimensionless function of @xmath31 which depends on the galaxy model and @xmath32 is the virial radius of a galaxy .",
    "makino & hut ( 1997 ) demonstrate that @xmath30 is a constant ( @xmath33 ) to good accuracy for @xmath34 for several different galaxy models .",
    "clearly , not all galaxies participate in merging at any given time ; most galaxies have merger time scales much longer than the hubble time .",
    "rather , only galaxies in dense environments such as groups or clusters of galaxies have significant probability to merge with others . to make the problem more tractable",
    "it is assumed that a fraction , @xmath35 , of all galaxies [ @xmath36 under consideration at any given time is in dense environments ( i.e. , typical groups / clusters at @xmath37 ) where most mergers occur , and the remainder of galaxies ( i.e. , field galaxies ) have zero probability of merger .",
    "then , the total merger rate is @xmath38 and the quasar abundance at any given redshift @xmath37 is    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the assumed quasar lifetime ( assuming that @xmath41 is much less than the hubble time , which turns out to be necessary for the model to be viable ) .",
    "there are two significantly uncertain remaining parameters , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which need to be specified .",
    "it is noted that quasar activities at high redshift seem to occur mostly in regions with galaxy number density typical of present - day clusters / groups of galaxies .",
    "this information is provided by observations of quasar companions which have a typical separation from a quasar of a few hundred comoving kiloparsecs ( e.g. , djorgovski 1999 ) . at redshift @xmath42",
    "there is evidence from larger observational data sets that quasars reside in cluster - like environment ( hall & green 1998 ) .",
    "it thus appears that @xmath27 may be a weak function of redshift and is assumed to be constant here ( more discussion on this later ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion of characteristic systems ( groups / clusters in this case ) , @xmath28 , should be a decreasing function of redshift in any hierarchical cosmological model . here",
    "we take advantage of the insight of kaiser ( 1986 ) and use the solution for simple power - law models : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the power index of the primordial density fluctuation spectrum at the relevant scales for clusters / groups . for",
    "cold dark matter like models or from observations of local large scale structure @xmath44 is expected to be @xmath45 .",
    "the purpose of estimating lbg formation rate at @xmath5 is met by finding @xmath22 at @xmath5 that matches the observed quasar abundance in the range @xmath11 . for the present analysis a simple functional form of lbg formation rate",
    "is adopted : @xmath46 consistent with the latest lbg observations at high redshift up to @xmath14 ( steidel 1999 ) , where @xmath47 is a normalization constant . at @xmath5 , where observations are unavailable ,",
    "a simple form is proposed so as to provide an adequate fit to the observed quasar abundance at @xmath5 ( see figure 1 below ) . using equations ( 1 - 3,5 - 6 ) , we find @xmath48 ( equation 4 ) , shown as the heavy solid curve in figure 1 . here ,",
    "for the shown @xmath48 we use @xmath49 , @xmath50km / s , @xmath51km / s , @xmath52 ( being constant which is consistent with the adoption of @xmath53 powerlaw model ) , @xmath54mpc@xmath55 , @xmath56kpc , @xmath57 and @xmath58yrs . a cosmological model with @xmath20 and hubble constant @xmath21km / sec / mpc",
    "is assumed . also shown as symbols are observational data of bright quasars ( @xmath15 ) : open circles are from warren ( 1994 ) and solid dots are from schmidt ( 1995 ) .",
    "the open square from kennefick , djordovski , & de carvalho ( 1995 ) for @xmath59 quasars is shown to indicate the steepness of quasar luminosity function near the absolute magnitude @xmath60 .",
    "it is seen that the merger model provides an adequate fit to the observed luminous quasar abundance in the entire redshift range considered ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the dashed curve in figure 1 shows @xmath22 with arbitrary vertical units .",
    "the dotted curve in figure 1 shows @xmath61 , normalized to be @xmath62mpc@xmath55 at @xmath63 . note that figure 5 of steidel ( 1999 ) shows the differential luminosity function of uv bright lbg galaxies ( i.e. , star - forming galaxies ) , calling it @xmath64 , while here",
    ", @xmath61 is the cumulative density of formed galaxies .",
    "roughly speaking , if @xmath22 is constant , then @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the hubble time at redshift @xmath37 and @xmath67 is the star ( burst ) formation duration ( i.e. , lbg phase ) of a galaxy . since @xmath68 , the above normalization roughly corresponds to lbgs with @xmath69mpc@xmath55 , which in turn corresponds to lbgs with @xmath70 to @xmath18 ( figure 5 of steidel 1999 ) .",
    "on one hand , as @xmath48 at @xmath71 does not depend sensitively on the form of @xmath22 at @xmath5 , the good agreement between @xmath48 and the observed quasar abundance in the redshift range @xmath3 ( where both types of objects are observed ) suggests that the merger scenario of luminous lbgs provides a quantitatively viable model for bright quasar formation . on the other hand , @xmath48 at @xmath5",
    "does depend sensitively on the adopted form of @xmath22 at @xmath5 .",
    "the fact that the proposed model yields an overall shape at @xmath72 that fits observations implies that the luminous lbg formation rate should drop off at @xmath5 as indicated by @xmath22 in eq . 1 , _ if merger scenario holds at @xmath5_. but to have a secure estimate of @xmath22 at @xmath5 , it is vital to understand the dependences of @xmath48 on various other parameters , namely , @xmath73 .",
    "we have set each of the parameters constant ( independent of redshift ) , which is considered to _ conservative _ in the following discussions _ if _ a more likely redshift dependence of the quoted parameter ( holding all other parameters constant ) would require an even steeper decreasing function for @xmath22 at @xmath5 than indicated by equation ( 6 ) .",
    "let us now examine each parameter to assess how each parameter may vary with redshift .",
    "first , it seems that @xmath26 , @xmath32 and @xmath74 are likely to decrease with redshift , making the assumption of their being constant _",
    "conservative_.    second , @xmath52 is equivalent to the assumption of mergers taking place in galaxy systems corresponding roughly to @xmath75 peaks and has implications for the correlation function of quasars .",
    "the bias factor of halos over mass is @xmath76 ( mo & white 1996 ) , equal to @xmath77 for @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "if the cluster - cluster correlation function has a shape @xmath80 ( close to the usual slope of @xmath81 ) , then the correlation length of clusters is @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the correlation length of the underlying mass and evolves as @xmath84 ( kaiser 1986 ) for @xmath53 and @xmath24 .",
    "our choice of @xmath52 consequently implies a correlation length for quasars of approximately @xmath85 , which is equal to @xmath86 comoving mpc at @xmath0 ( using @xmath87mpc ) , in agreement with what is observed for quasars ( e.g. , kundic 1997 ; boyle 1998 ) . in any case , it is unlikely that @xmath88 decreases with redshift .",
    "therefore , setting @xmath35 constant is _ conservative_. an important implication of this model is that the comoving correlation length of luminous quasars should _ decrease _ with redshift no faster than @xmath89 at @xmath11 , a potentially testable prediction .",
    "stephens ( 1997 ) give a correlation length of @xmath90 quasars of @xmath91mpc .",
    "it will be very valuable to determine the correlation length of high redshift quasars with significantly smaller errorbars .",
    "third , observations may have indicated that @xmath27 may be an increasing function of redshift at @xmath5 ( djorgovski 1997 ; djorgovski 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , assuming @xmath27 to be constant is _",
    "conservative_.    finally , for a plausible power spectrum ( such as cdm like ) @xmath44 is likely to be smaller at smaller scales thus smaller at higher redshift .",
    "thus , assuming @xmath44 to be a constant is _",
    "conservative_. overall , our assumption of constancy for various parameters seems _ conservative _ ; i.e. , @xmath22 should decrease at least as rapidly as indicated by equation ( 6 ) at @xmath5 .",
    "all the analyses so far have been based on the available ( optical ) observations of quasars , which appears to indicate a sharp drop - off of quasar abundance at @xmath5 .",
    "dust obscuration effects are often invoked to explain the apparent drop - off of quasar abundances at high redshift ( e.g. , ostriker & heiler 1984 ; pei 1995 ) .",
    "however , recent radio surveys of high redshift quasars seem to indicate that the drop - off of the number density of bright radio quasars is very similar to that from optical surveys ( e.g. , hook , shaver , & mcmahon 1998 ) with the implication that the effect of dust on the observed drop - off of bright quasars at @xmath11 may be small .",
    "one potential problem with the merger model is that observations show that a large fraction of quasar hosts at low redshift ( @xmath92 ) appear to be quite normal looking , i.e. , without disturbed appearances .",
    "but one would expect that , if galaxy - galaxy merger time scale is longer than the proposed quasar lifetime , all quasar hosts should display appearances of some interaction .",
    "one possible solution to this problem is that quasar formation is delayed , i.e. , a quasar does not start to shine until the galaxy - galaxy merger is nearly complete . in other words , the time it takes to set up the central ( bh ) region for quasar activity during galaxy merger may be comparable to the time that it takes for the two galaxies to merger .",
    "in an early classic paper efstathiou & rees ( 1988 ) show that quasar abundance at high redshift can be accounted for in the standard cold dark matter model _ if massive halos are related to the formation of black holes _",
    ", with an intriguing prediction that the abundance of luminous quasars should decrease rapidly beyond @xmath16 ( for a more recent treatment see haehnelt & rees 1993 ) .",
    "[ the evolution of low - luminosity quasars , of course , does not necessarily have to follow that of their luminous counterparts ( e.g. , haiman & loeb 1998 ) ] .    in this _",
    "letter _ a different approach is taken by directly relating the _ observed _ evolution of luminous lbgs to the _ observed _ evolution of luminous quasars at high redshift ( @xmath11 ) . with a set of seemingly reasonable parameter values , it is shown that consistency between the two classes of objects at @xmath3 , where both classes are observed , can be achieved , if one assumes that 1 ) _ lyman break galaxies merger to trigger quasar activity _ and 2 ) _ quasar lifetime is @xmath12yrs_. at @xmath5 , consistency can be achieved , _ only if additionally",
    "_ the formation rate of luminous lbgs drops off as @xmath93 or faster , a prediction that may be tested by future observations .",
    "one implication from this model is that lbgs with @xmath17 to @xmath18 merge to form quasars with @xmath15 at @xmath11 .",
    "correlation analysis of relevant lbgs and quasars should shed light on this .    at lower redshift additional , more model dependent assumptions regarding the supply of available gas to fuel black holes",
    "would be required to make qualitatively viable predictions .",
    "kauffmann & haehnelt ( 1999 ; see also haiman & menou 1999 ) have presented a detailed model , based also on merger scenario , to unify the evolution of galaxies and quasars in the cold dark matter model under several plausible assumptions concerning the evolution of fuel gas to the central black holes .",
    "the success of the model of kauffmann & haehnelt ( 1999 ) at low redshift ( @xmath10 ) and the model presented here at high redshift ( @xmath11 ) , both based on galaxy merger scenario , suggests that _ galaxy merger may play an indispensable role in quasar formation . _    the work is supported in part by grants ast9318185 and asc9740300 .",
