    "there is solid evidence that , in most spiral galaxies , the linewiths of hi emission line , @xmath0 , vary radially from @xmath1 to @xmath2 km s@xmath3 in the central parts to a very constant value between @xmath4 to @xmath5 km s@xmath3 in the outer parts ( @xcite ) . our main goal is to assess how much of the velocity dispersion observed in extended hi galactic disks is due to the impact of hvcs and intermediate velocity clouds ( ivcs ) .",
    "strong evidence for the presence of continuing gaseous infall to the galactic disk and external galaxies has been compiled in @xcite . not all the accreting material should have an extragalactic origin .",
    "@xcite showed that the galactic fountain can efficiently cycle matter from the center of the galaxy to its outskirts at a rate of @xmath6 m@xmath7 yr@xmath3 .",
    "the simulations were performed with the mhd code zeus3d ( stone & norman 1992a , 1992b ) and the mhd ",
    "tvd code ( @xcite ) . our local frame of reference is rotating with the disk .",
    "at a distance @xmath8 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "we have run two - dimensional ( 2d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) simulations .",
    "the coordinates ( @xmath9,@xmath10 ) correspond to the horizontal ( planar ) direction and @xmath11 to the perpendicular direction .",
    "the boundary conditions are _ periodic _ in the @xmath9axis and @xmath10axis , and _ outflow _ in the @xmath11axis .",
    "the evolution was computed in the quasi  isothermal regime ( @xmath12=1.01 ) , ignoring gas self  gravity and differential rotation . in the 2d simulations ,",
    "the magnetic field has only one component along the @xmath10axis and is initially stratified in the @xmath11direction , @xmath13(@xmath11 ) .",
    "the ism is initially in magnetohydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the resolution of the domain for our 2d simulations was of @xmath14 zones , and @xmath15 zones for the 3d case .",
    "all infalling clouds have the same physical characteristics , initial radius @xmath16  pc and internal density @xmath17  @xmath18",
    ". the accretion mass rate due to the accreting clouds is @xmath19 m@xmath7 yr@xmath3 .",
    "the chvcs are injected at @xmath20  kpc , i.e. , the injection occurs in both caps of the disk , with a vertical velocity @xmath21  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the case where the injection occurs only along one side was discussed in santilln et al .",

    "plane at two selected times ( 0.375 and 0.400 gyr).,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   plane at two selected times ( 0.375 and 0.400 gyr).,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    the 2d evolution of the ism in the outskirts of a galactic disk is shown in figure  [ fig : hvc ] .",
    "the disk suffers the continuous bombardment of chvcs during 2  gyr .",
    "the impact of each cloud produces a strong galactic shock directed downward and a reverse shock that penetrates into the cloud ( @xcite ) .",
    "when two shocks that moves in opposite directions collide , most of the kinetic motion , which ultimately contributes to the gas velocity dispersion , is dissipated .",
    "the steady - state vertical velocity dispersion is close to transonic as long as the injection velocity of the clouds is @xmath22 km s@xmath3 . in the vertical direction ,",
    "accelerated gas due to incident clouds are decelerated by the external gravitational potential and falls back to the disk .",
    "again , this falling material may collide with ascending gas , leading to energy dissipation and momentum cancellation .",
    "although the details differ , the basic gasdynamic phenomena described above and density contrasts and magnitude of the velocity dispersion are quite similar in the 3d simulations .",
    "the clouds loss its identity because they sweep up interstellar gas as they travel through the dense disk . in order to visualize their effect on the disk ,",
    "figure  [ fig : planexy ] shows the density distribution across the equatorial plane ( @xmath23 ) of the disk .",
    "we see the presence of elongated regions of higher density that resemble filaments and other more rounded regions of @xmath24 pc size , which can be interpreted as holes .",
    "the appearance of the density resembles that found in simulations of supernova  driven turbulence .",
    "the inclusion of cooling and diffuse uv heating will result in a larger dynamical range in density .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that the result that the velocity dispersion of the warm phase is transonic is a very general rule independent on these additional ingredients .",
    "the most sensitive parameter in our simulations is the internal density of the clouds .",
    "if this density is below a certain critical value , clouds are destroyed in the upper halo and then the disk at @xmath25 can not feel that the accretion is clumpy . in that case , the response of the disk is similar to the ram pressure exerted by a smooth wind . in order to circumvent this limitation , we plan to simulate the accretion of clouds with an astrophysically motivated spectrum of masses and of sizes , so that they may have different internal densities .",
    "the final fate of hi gas filaments in the galactic halos is accretion onto the disk .",
    "it is important to have a view of the response of the gaseous disk to accretion even if , surely , this is not the sole mechanism for driving turbulent motions in the outer parts of galactic disks .",
    "our simulations suggest that for mass accretion rates consistent with current empirical determinations , the rain of chvc onto the galactic disks can maintain transonic turbulent motions in the warm phase . in a forthcoming paper , we will report the evolution and amplification of the magnetic field and vorticity , and compare the distributions of surface density and velocity dispersion of our patch of the disk with observations .",
