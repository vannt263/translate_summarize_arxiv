    "in the galactic center ( gc ) , prominent 6.4 kev line of neutral iron ( fe  k@xmath4 ) has been detected from giant molecular clouds ( mcs ) such as sagittarius ( sgr ) b ( @xmath5 ; @xcite ) , sgr  c ( @xmath6 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and sgr  a ( @xmath7 ; @xcite ) . the spectra show large equivalent width ( @xmath8 1  kev ) and strong absorption ( @xmath9  h  @xmath10 ) to the continuum , which suggests that the 6.4  kev bright mcs are due to the irradiation and fluorescence by possible external x - rays ( x - ray reflection nebulae : xrne ) rather than particle irradiation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "subsequently , the xrn scenario has become more conclusive owing to the discovery of the short - term ( a few years ) 6.4  kev variability in the small ( a few light - years ) regions in sgr  b ( @xcite ) and sgr  a ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , in sgr  b , the same time variability of hard continuum x - rays ( @xmath11  kev ) has been found to be in correlation with the 6.4  kev line by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these results promoted the idea of the external irradiation source being a past flare of the super massive black hole sgr  a * ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in the xrn context",
    ", one can derive the x - ray light curve of sgr  a * for the past several hundred years .",
    "the flare luminosity and look - back ( delay ) time depend on the position of the xrn relative to sgr  a * and the sun ( observer ) .",
    "however , most of the previous estimates used solely the projected distance or indirect information of line - of - sight positions .",
    "@xcite successfully developed an original method of determining the line - of - sight position for the sgr  b xrne .",
    "their method involves careful spectral analysis of xrne in combination with the spatial and spectral information of the gc plasma x - ray emission ( gcpe ) .",
    "@xcite recently performed an intensive investigation on the 6.7 kev ( fe k@xmath4 ) line profile for the entire gc region ( @xmath12 ) ; thereafter , @xcite extended the work to other emission lines of highly ionized sulfur ( s ) , argon ( ar ) , and calcium ( ca ) .",
    "these studies quantitatively constructed the gcpe as a two - temperature plasma and determined its three - dimensional spatial distribution .",
    "on the basis of these new pictures of the gcpe , we establish the method to measure the three - dimensional positions of the sgr  c xrne . the observation and analyses of the sgr  c data are given in section  2 and 3 .",
    "we derive a face - on view of xrne in section  4.1 and compare its reliability with that of radio observations in section  4.2 .",
    "we then combine these results with the sgr  b data and results ( @xcite ) to calculate the time delay and the corresponding x - ray flare luminosity to reconstruct the long - term ( @xmath0500 years ) light curve for sgr  a * , which occurred in the past .",
    "the derivation method and discussion for the activity history of sgr  a * are given in section  4.4 .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt 8.0  kpc ( @xcite ) as the distance between the sun and sgr  a * ; thus , corresponds to 140  pc at the gc .",

    "the xis system consists of three sets of front - illuminated ( fi ) charge coupled device ( ccd ) cameras ( xis0 , 2 , and 3 ) and one set of back - illuminated ( bi ) ccd camera ( xis  1 ) ; each ccd chip contains 1024@xmath141024 pixels ( 1  pixel = 24  @xmath15m@xmath1624@xmath17 m ) for a @xmath14 field of view .",
    "two calibration sources of @xmath18fe are installed to illuminate two corners of each ccd for absolute gain tuning .",

    "archive data information on the sgr  b and other relevant gc regions can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we perform the data reduction and analysis using headas software version 6.12 .",
    "the calibration database used to calculate the response of xis and the effective area of xrt is the version released on 2011 - 02 - 10 . since the relative gains and response functions of the fi ccds are essentially the same , the fi spectra are merged in the spectral fitting . for the images described in the following sections and spectral analyses , the non - x - ray background ( nxb ; @xcite )",

    "figure  [ sgrc_img]d shows the 23  kev band image including the 2.45  kev line ( s ) and displays the distribution of the low - temperature plasma ( lp ) and individual thermal diffuse sources , mainly supernova remnants candidates , with temperatures of k@xmath211  kev .",
    "the faint diffuse sources near the sgr  c clumps are the supernova remnants g359.41@xmath220.12 and its outflow `` chimney '' ( @xcite ) . to investigate the nature of the gcpe ( hp and lp ) , we selected two regions with relatively weak 6.4  kev emission for spectral analyses , and designate them as ref1 and ref2 ( solid circles ; figure  [ sgrc_img]a , b , and d ) .",
    "the x - ray spectra of the gc region have been extensively studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the spectra can be reproduced by the superposition of four components : the gcpe , the xrn emissions ( xrne ) , the foreground emission ( fe ) , and the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) . these components have the following properties .",
    "the gcpe has two - temperature plasmas with k@xmath23@xmath01  kev and k@xmath23@xmath07  kev for lp and hp , respectively .",
    "the xrne is expressed as neutral ion lines ( k@xmath4 and k@xmath24 ) associated with a power - law component .",
    "since the xrne is formed by thomson scattering of a continuum component and fluorescence of iron atoms in the mcs , it shows a large absorption ( abs1 ) of @xmath25  h  @xmath10 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which is approximately equal to the @xmath26 through the mc .",
    "the gcpe including the hp and lp is extended in the gc region , and the mc is inside this region .",
    "thus , a fraction ( @xmath27 ) of the x - ray from the gcpe is not absorbed by the mc while the other fraction ( 1@xmath28 ) is absorbed by the mc ( abs1 ) .",
    "both gcpe and xrne exhibit an common interstellar absorption ( abs2 ) of @xmath29 6 @xmath30  h  @xmath10 between the gc and the sun ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fe is approximated to a thermal plasma of k@xmath23@xmath01  kev with small absorption .",
    "the cxb ( e.g. , @xcite ) has the absorption of abs2 by twice ( interstellar absorption in front of and behind the gc ) , in addition to abs1 ( mc ) .",
    "thus , the spectral model can be expressed by equation  ( 1 ) . a schematic picture of this model is shown in figure  [ los ] .",

    "therefore , we apply the same model to the sgr  c region . in figure",

    "these settings are designed to verify a common and consistent xrn model .",
    "other parameters , such as line intensity ( @xmath40 ) and absorption ( @xmath26 ) , are free and independent for each region . to investigate the time variability for c1 and c2 ,",
    "the 6.4  kev intensities of the 2006 and 2010 spectra are set as free parameters , while other parameters are common between the two spectra .",

    "the short flare at 200300 years ago would be responsible for the short - term time variability of sgr  b2 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and hence the variability time scale would be 510 years .",
    "the other short flare at @xmath0100 years ago has similar time - scale as inferred by the 6.4  kev time variability ( increase ) of c1 in 4 years ( 20062010 ) at 3-@xmath13 level ( table  [ fit ] ) .",
    "this flare may correspond to the time variability of the sgr  a xrne . @xcite and",
    "@xcite reported variability of the 6.4 kev line from the sgr  a cloud in a short time - scale of 35 years at a @xmath146 sigma level . then @xcite and @xcite predicted the flare - like events occurred at @xmath0100400 years ago , which is basically consistent with our results .",
    "@xcite proposed that the flare should have started @xmath0400 years ago , while @xcite suggested that a high period ended @xmath0150 years ago from the illumination pattern in the sgr a complex .",
    "however , the estimated flare luminosities are different : @xmath147 erg  s@xmath3 was suggested by @xcite , while @xmath148 erg  s@xmath3 was suggested by @xcite .",
    "these inconsistencies are mainly attributable to unclear line - of - sight positions and partly due to the difficult estimation of @xmath26 for the sgr  a xrne .",
    "the luminosity determined by @xcite is @xmath149@xmath150 erg  s@xmath3 around 70 and 130 years ago , which is about 10 times lower than that obtained here : @xmath151 erg  s@xmath3 at @xmath090 years ago .",
    "the high luminosity indicated by c1 may be attributed to a short - term flare that occurred in the fading period reported by @xcite .",
    "a unified analysis for the sgr  a xrne as performed in sgr  c and sgr  b in this paper would slove these problems .",
    "the average x - ray luminosity in the high state was @xmath15210@xmath153  erg  s@xmath3 , which is only @xmath154 of the sgr  a * eddington limit ( @xmath15510@xmath156  erg  s@xmath3 ) with a mass of 4@xmath157  m@xmath158 ( @xcite ) .",
    "still , from this luminosity , we may state that sgr  a * has been a low - luminosity agn ( e.g. , m  81 ; @xcite ) for the past 500 years .",
    "the present x - ray luminosity of sgr  a * is @xmath159  erg  s@xmath3 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and hence a sudden luminosity drop by 46 orders of magnitude should have occurred within @xmath0100 years .",
    "@xcite reported that the quasar ic  2497 with mass of @xmath160  m@xmath158 experienced an dramatic luminosity drop by more than 4 orders of magnitude in 4500070000 years .",
    "on the other hand , for the galactic x - ray binaries with a black hole mass of @xmath010 m@xmath158 ( e.g. , grs 1915 + 10 ; @xcite ) , a state change from high / soft to low / hard was detected on a time scale of 1  hour .",
    "assuming that the state - change time scale is proportional to black - hole mass , at a mass of 4@xmath161 , 70000 years ( for @xmath162 ) and 1 hour ( for @xmath163 ) correspond to 280 years and 46 years , respectively .",
    "then , the time scale of the luminosity drop for sgr  a * is estimated to be as fast as 50300 years , which is consistent with the prediction in our light curve ( figure  [ lc ] ) .",
