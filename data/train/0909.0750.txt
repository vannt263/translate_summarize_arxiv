    "there is furthermore evidence for a relation between star formation activity and size : at @xmath4 , star forming galaxies are on average a factor of 2 smaller than local galaxies of similar mass , while quiescent galaxies on average are smaller by a factor of 3 - 6 @xcite , suggesting the existence of a significant population of massive galaxies with extremely dense old stellar populations , which are not easily explained by current galaxy formation models .",
    "all these observations are based on relatively small samples of galaxies , with a range of possible biases resulting from different selection schemes . in this paper",
    "we present the first study focusing on the correlation between star formation activity and size in a large mass - limited sample of galaxies at @xmath8 .    throughout the paper",

    "we adopt the photometric redshifts of @xcite which were derived from the uv - ir seds ( calibrated using 1477 spectroscopic redshifts ) and have an accuracy of @xmath14 at @xmath15 , and the sed modeling of @xcite who fits @xcite stellar population synthesis models to derive constraints on the star formation rates , histories , ages , stellar masses , extinction etc .",
    "we here use the results for a calzetti extinction law , solar metallicity and a salpeter imf , ( which we renormalized to a @xcite imf by multiplying derived masses and star formation rates by @xmath16 , see * ? ? ?",
    "we note that the derived masses decrease on average by a factor of 1.4 when @xcite models are used .",
    "there is no evidence for this factor being dependent on color , mass or redshift @xcite .",
    "we constructed a complete ( see * ? ? ?",

    "we compare the sizes of 126 galaxies with overlapping isaac k - band and nic3 f160w - band data .",
    "the nic3 data is more than three magnitudes deeper than the isaac data ( 10 @xmath25 limiting magnitude @xmath26 ) , and has better resolution @xmath27 , so with this comparison we can test the derived sizes for systematic uncertainties introduced by limited resolution and signal to noise . as can be seen from fig .",

    "these are faint ( @xmath33 ) and small ( @xmath34 ) .",

    "they studied in great details the effects of low signal to noise , and small intrinsic sizes on the derived structural parameters , using simulations , and found no significant systematic biases in the derived sizes , but an increasing scatter with magnitude , in agreement with the conclusion from fig.[niccompare ] .",
    "we also fitted the sizes of the galaxies in our sample in the acs f606w band images . based on these fits",
    ", we removed 16 galaxies from the sample which had bright blue central sources with derived sizes consistent with being unresolved , since their broad band photometry and derived sizes are likely to be contaminated by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "based on the specific star formation rates ( ssfr ) derived from the sed fits , ( @xmath35 ) of galaxies in the sample has @xmath36 and are classified as `` star forming '' ( median @xmath37 ) , while @xmath38 has @xmath39 and are classified as `` quiescent '' ( median @xmath40 ) .",
    "these fractions are similar to those found for distant red galaxies @xcite as expected , since most massive galaxies are red at these redshifts .",
    "the corresponding volume densities are @xmath41 and @xmath42 for quiescent and star forming galaxies respectively ( error bars represent the estimated cosmic variance , see * ? ? ?",
    "the results are robust with respect to small changes in the ssfr threshold used for dividing the galaxies into star forming and quiescent , as relatively few galaxies ( @xmath43 ) have intermediate ( @xmath44 ) derived specific star formation rates .    in fig .",
    "[ masssize ] we plot the mass of the galaxies versus their effective radii . at a given mass ,",

    "the galaxies are smaller than local sdss galaxies of similar mass at all considered masses .",
    "we parametrize the evolution of the mass - size relation with @xmath46 , where a is the median offset between the relation at @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and use monte carlo simulations to derive the most likely value of a and its uncertainty .",
    "we generate 500 realizations of the data set by varying the photometric redshifts and corresponding stellar masses randomly within their @xmath28 errors ( derived from monte carlo simulations by @xcite ) . for each photo - z realization",
    "we calculate the corresponding physical size in kpc , and randomly perturb it according to the @xmath22 uncertainties shown in fig.[niccompare ] , derived from galfit and from the comparison to nicmos ( added in quadrature ) . for each realization",
    "we then calculate the median a , and estimate its uncertainty from its variation in the realizations . in this way we find that the star forming galaxies are a median factor of @xmath49 smaller than galaxies of similar mass in the local universe , while the quiescent galaxies are smaller by a median factor of @xmath50 .",
    "this difference is smaller than was found for quiescent drgs ( @xmath51 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and k - selected galaxies without emission lines at @xmath52 , ( @xmath53 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the scatter is large , with values ranging from @xmath54 .",
    "this difference is likely a consequence of the systematically higher redshifts ( @xmath55 ) and brighter k - band magnitudes of the galaxies in these studies relative to the median galaxy in the present mass selected sample .",
    "@xmath56 of the quiescent galaxies are unresolved in the isaac data with @xmath22 set to an upper limit of 0.5 pix .",
    "furthermore , from fig.[niccompare ] we concluded that the sizes of some of the smallest , faintest galaxies may be overestimated form the isaac data .",
    "these galaxies are included in the calculation of @xmath57 , which should thus be considered a lower limit for the size difference . also plotted in fig.[masssize ] is the surface mass density @xmath58 of the galaxies as a function of stellar mass . from the monte carlo simulations described above",
    ", we find that the quiescent galaxies are a median factor of @xmath59 denser than galaxies of similar mass locally , while the star forming galaxies are denser by a median factor of @xmath60 .    in the above size comparison",
    ", we compared to the local late - type relation when the best fitting sersic @xmath61 was @xmath62 and the local early type relation when @xmath63 , consistent with the definition of the relations in @xcite .",
    "one may worry that this could introduce systematic effects since the fitted n parameter is relatively uncertain , especially for the smallest galaxies , and we do not know for sure if the @xmath4 galaxies will evolve into early or late type galaxies , however since the local relations are very similar in the considered mass range , the derived median offsets from the local mass - size relation does not change significantly when the sizes , independently of the fitted @xmath61 , are compared to only the local early type ( @xmath64 ) or late type ( @xmath65 ) relations .    as an independent confirmation of the correlation we added mips 24@xmath66 imaging to the analysis . as shown by @xcite ,",
    "the ratio of flux at 24 and 4.5@xmath66 as measured by the spitzer mips and irac instruments is a good empirical tracer of the specific star formation rate ( and/or agn activity ) of galaxies in this redshift range . in fig .",
    "[ mips ] we plot this ratio ( @xmath67 ) as a function of size ( normalized by the local mass size relation ) .",
    "the majority of the quiescent galaxies have @xmath68 ( many of them only have upper limit detections , corresponding to @xmath69 ) while most of the star forming galaxies have @xmath70 , corresponding to @xmath71 , independently confirming the correlation between size and star formation activity ( based on sed fits ) , and that the quiescent galaxies are small and red due to extremely compact old quiescent stellar populations rather than dust enshrouded star formation or agn activity .",
    "the relation between star formation activity and size found here for a mass selected sample at @xmath4 is consistent with the relation between between color , size and mass and its evolution with redshift found by @xcite for a k - selected sample . at a given mass they found galaxy sizes to evolve like @xmath72 , corresponding to a size difference of @xmath73 , which is very similar to the size difference measured here for the whole sample ( quiescent+star forming galaxies ) : @xmath74 . for quiescent galaxies they found a faster evolution @xmath75",
    ", corresponding to @xmath76 , again consistent with the value derived here for quiescent galaxies @xmath77 .    in fig.[kormendy",
    "] we plot the kormendy relation between size and dust corrected restframe i - band surface brightness for the quiescent galaxies .",
    "also plotted are the kormendy relation of early type galaxies in sdss , and the predictions of simple passive evolution models which , if the stellar populations form at a common formation redshift @xmath78 , just shifts the relation vertically without changing its slope ( if the galaxies formed at different redshifts , the passive evolution could also change the slope ) .",
    "the @xmath4 quiescent galaxies are shifted to smaller sizes and higher surface brightnesses , than locally .",
    "the @xmath8 relation appear to be steeper , but this may be due to selection effects , as indicated by the dashed line , which shows the approximate position of galaxies at the mass limit ( @xmath79 ) . using bootstrapping , we find that the surface brightness of the @xmath4 galaxies on median are @xmath80 brighter than similar size local galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with results from of smaller samples at similar redshifts @xcite .",
    "note that a population of small ( @xmath81 ) quiescent elliptical galaxies exist in the local universe ( e.g in the virgo cluster , see @xcite ) , which is missed by sdss selection function .",
    "however these are typically faint , low mass dwarf galaxies , with surface brightnesses in agreement with the local kormendy relation shown in fig.[kormendy ] .",
    "the @xmath4 relation can not evolve into the local relation through simple passive evolution , as this would result in galaxies which are too small and bright for their mass , compared to what is observed .",
    "in other words , the galaxies need to evolve in size in addition to the passive fading of their stellar light to evolve into the local population .",
    "a possible formation scenario for the ultra compact quiescent galaxies is through high redshift gas rich mergers , which models suggests under certain circumstances can create very dense stellar populations ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "examples of high redshift gas rich mergers with intense associated star formation are sub - mm selected galaxies ( smgs ) , which in some cases have very high central concentrations of molecular gas and dynamical mass densities comparable to the central stellar density found here in the quiescent galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for this reason , an evolutionary connection between the two galaxy types has been hypothesized @xcite .",
    "a simple connection is however unlikely .",
    "in contrast to the quiescent galaxies , smgs are among the most vigorously star forming galaxies known in the universe . high extinction and evidence for a large fraction of interacting / merging systems among smgs complicate the comparison of their sizes with those of more common star forming galaxies at @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite find half light radii of a few to @xmath12 10 kpc for samples of @xmath82 smgs , which are more similar to the range spanned by our star forming sub sample , and thus consistent with the sfr - size trend ( but see @xcite for a contrasting view ) .",
    "such large inferred sizes , together with extended disturbed morphologies and dynamics seen in a fraction of smgs , are clearly different than for many of the quiescent galaxies studied here .",
    "it seems implausible that all smgs could be turned off and appear as compact remnants within very short timescales ( the redshift distributions are similar ) .",
    "the old stellar ages measured for the quiescent galaxies ( 0.5 - 1.5 gyr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and their compact structure suggest that they formed the majority of their stars in highly concentrated ( nuclear ) star bursts at @xmath83 .",
    "this suggests that a population of very compact , intensely star forming galaxies exists at @xmath84 , with properties quite different from the bulk of star forming galaxies at @xmath4 , which are extended , and dominated by spatially distributed star formation . if their star formation is relatively unobscured , these galaxies may be present in b - band and v - band drop out selected samples of @xmath85 and @xmath86 galaxies .",
    "interestingly , the space densities of the brightest ( @xmath87 ) b - band and ( @xmath88 ) v - band drop out galaxies are similar to the space density of quiescent @xmath4 galaxies @xcite , however their ( restframe uv ) sizes are considerable larger ( @xmath89 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if their star formation is triggered by gas rich major mergers , it may be obscured by dust , in which case these galaxies would not be present in lyman drop selected samples , but may be detectable as a population of dense @xmath84 sub - mm galaxies . identifying smgs at these redshifts",
    "is however difficult , since they fall below the detection limit of the deepest radio vla maps , needed for identifying their optical counterpart due to the poor resolution of current sub - mm facilities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , only a few examples of smgs are known at these redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , all of which have been detected in radio .",
    "however , a significant fraction of smgs ( about 1/3 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are unidentified in radio and are thus likely to be at @xmath90",
    ". some of these may be progenitors of the @xmath4 quiescent galaxies .",
    "while the derived stellar mass densities in the quiescent galaxies ( @xmath91 ) are much higher than in local massive galaxies , comparable or higher densities are found in globular clusters and ultra compact dwarf galaxies ( @xmath92 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are some of the oldest stellar systems known . even though their total masses are much smaller ( @xmath93 )",
    ", and there may not be a direct connection to the compact @xmath8 quiescent galaxies , it is interesting to note that star bursts in the early universe can result in extremely compact stellar distributions .",
    "the quiescent galaxies at @xmath8 are dominated by old extremely compact stellar populations , so it would be natural to assume that they would continue to evolve passively into local elliptical galaxies , which are the oldest , densest , most massive galaxies in the local universe . from fig .",
    "[ masssize ] and [ kormendy ] it is clear that this scenario is ruled out , as passive evolution would result in too many extremely compact massive galaxies with too high surface brightnesses , compared to what is observed .",
    "some elliptical galaxies in the local universe have super solar metallicities . assuming super solar ( @xmath94 ) metallicity in the sed fits , on average leads to @xmath95 smaller masses for the quiescent galaxies , which is not enough to explain their unusually high mass densities .",
    "the high masses and small sizes of the quiescent galaxies corresponds to unusually high expected velocity dispersions ( @xmath96 , see also @xcite .",
    "this has been observationally confirmed from a deep restframe optical spectrum of a @xmath97 , @xmath98 compact , quiescent galaxy which has a measured @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "recently , a small number of low redshift galaxies with velocity dispersions @xmath100 , high stellar masses ( @xmath101 ) and unusually small sizes ( 1 - 2 kpc ) were found in the sdss @xcite .",
    "their derived stellar surface mass densities are however not as extreme as for the quiescent galaxies found here ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and they are extremely rare , with @xmath102 times smaller space densities ( @xmath103 ) , so a simple evolutionary connection is unlikely .",
    "one of the most promising processes for decreasing the stellar mass density of the quiescent galaxies is dry merging .",
    "simulations suggests that under favorable conditions , an equal mass dry merger can increase the size of the remnant by up to a factor of two ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as indicated in fig .",
    "[ masssize ] , the compact quiescent galaxies would need to go through 2 - 3 successive equal mass mergers to end up near the local mass - size relation , which would result in remnant masses in excess of @xmath104 .",
    "the space density of @xmath105 early type galaxies in the sdss sample of @xcite is @xmath106 , a factor of 10 lower than the density of the @xmath4 quiescent @xmath107 galaxies considered here .",
    "interestingly , three successive equal mass dry mergers of the quiescent @xmath4 galaxies could thus result in remnants with masses and number densities comparable to those of the most massive local elliptical galaxies , but possibly not with with quite as large sizes ( see also e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "recent studies have explored minor dry merging as an efficient way of decreasing the central stellar mass density of the @xmath8 quiescent galaxies to the value observed in local ellipticals , and the possibility that the compact stellar populations of some of them could survive to the present day , hidden in centres of local ellipticals underneath lower density envelopes of stars accreted at later times @xcite . finally , if the imf evolves with time and were more top heavy in the past as suggested by e.g. @xcite , part of the offset from the local mass - size relation could be explained by a systematic over estimation of the masses at @xmath4 .",
