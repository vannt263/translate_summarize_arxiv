    "the recently published planck satellite data @xcite have generally confirmed the predictions of the standard @xmath0cdm ( @xmath0cold dark matter ) cosmological model , as well as the matter composition of the universe .",
    "the @xmath0cdm model successfully describes the accelerated expansion of the universe , the observed temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation , the large scale matter distribution , and the main aspects of the formation and the evolution of virialized cosmological objects . on the other hand the latest cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data , as well as the observations of the distant type ia supernovae , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , weak gravitational lensing , and the abundance of galaxy clusters , provide compelling evidence that about 95% of the content of the universe resides in two unknown forms of matter / energy , called dark matter and dark energy , respectively : the first residing in bound objects as non - luminous matter at the galactic and extragalactic scale @xcite , while the latter is in the form of a zero - point energy that pervades the whole universe @xcite",
    "the dark matter is assumed to be composed of cold neutral weakly interacting massive particles , beyond those existing in the standard model of particle physics , and not yet detected in accelerators or in dedicated direct and indirect searches .",
    "there are many possible candidates for dark matter , the most popular ones being the axions and the weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp ) ( for a review of the particle physics aspects of dark matter see @xcite ) .",
    "the interaction cross sections of dark matter particles with normal baryonic matter , while extremely small , are expected to be non - zero , and we may expect to detect them directly @xcite .",
    "scalar fields or other long range coherent fields coupled to gravity have also intensively been used to model galactic dark matter @xcite .",
    "alternative theoretical models to explain the galactic rotation curves have also been elaborated recently @xcite .    despite its important achievements , at galactic scales of the order of @xmath1 kpc ,",
    "the @xmath2cdm model faces major challenges in explaining the observed distribution of the dark matter around the luminous one .",
    "in fact , @xmath3-body simulations , performed in the @xmath0cdm scenario , have shown that bound halos surrounding galaxies must have very characteristic density profiles that feature a well pronounced central cusp , @xmath4 @xcite , where @xmath5 is a scale radius and @xmath6 is a characteristic density . on the observational side ,",
    "high - resolution rotation curves show , instead , that the actual distribution of dark matter is much shallower than the simulated one , and it presents a nearly constant density core : @xmath7 @xcite , where @xmath8 is the core radius and @xmath9 is the central density . therefore , to solve this contradiction between observation and theory , new models and a new understanding of dark matter and its properties",
    "are required .",
    "the observation of the bose - einstein condensation in 1995 in dilute alkali gases , such as vapors of rubidium and sodium , confined in a magnetic trap , and cooled to very low temperatures @xcite did represent a major breakthrough in condensed matter and statistical physics . at very low temperatures , all particles in a dilute bose gas condense to the same quantum ground state , forming a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , i.e. , a sharp peak over a broader distribution in both coordinates and momentum space .",
    "particles become correlated with each other when their wavelengths overlap , that is , the thermal wavelength @xmath10 is greater than the mean inter - particles distance @xmath11 .",
    "this happens at a temperature @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the mass of the particle in the condensate , @xmath14 is the number density , and @xmath15 is boltzmann s constant @xcite .",
    "a coherent state develops when the particle density is high enough , or the temperature is sufficiently low . from experimental point of view",
    ", the occurrence of the condensation is indicated by a sharp peak in the velocity distribution , observed below a critical temperature .",
    "this show that all the atoms have condensed in the same ground state , with a narrow peak in the momentum and coordinate space @xcite .",
    "quantum degenerate gases have been created by a combination of laser and evaporative cooling techniques , opening several new lines of research , at the border of atomic , statistical and condensed matter physics @xcite .    since the bose - einstein condensation is a phenomenon observed and well studied in the laboratory , the possibility that it may occur on astrophysical or cosmic scales can not be rejected _",
    "a priori_. thus , dark matter , which is required to explain the dynamics of the neutral hydrogen clouds at large distances from the galactic center , and which is a cold , bosonic system , could also be in the form of a bose - einstein condensate @xcite . in this",
    "early studies either a phenomenological approach was used , or the non - relativistic gross - pitaevskii equation describing the condensate was investigated numerically .",
    "a systematic study of the condensed galactic dark matter halos and of their properties was performed in @xcite . by introducing the madelung representation of the wave function , the dynamics of the dark matter halo can be formulated in terms of the continuity equation and of the hydrodynamic euler equations .",
    "hence condensed dark matter can be described as a non - relativistic , newtonian gas , whose density and pressure are related by a barotropic equation of state . in the case of a condensate with quartic non - linearity ,",
    "the equation of state is polytropic with index @xmath16 @xcite .    to test the validity of the condensed dark matter model the newtonian tangential velocity equation",
    "was fitted with a sample of rotation curves of low surface brightness and dwarf galaxies , respectively .",
    "a very good agreement was found between the theoretical rotation curves and the observational data",
    ". therefore dark matter halos can be described as an assembly of light individual bosons that acquire a repulsive interaction by occupying the same ground energy state .",
    "the repulsive interaction prevents gravity from forming the central density cusps .",
    "the condensate particle is light enough to naturally form condensates of very small masses that later may coalesce , forming the structures of the universe in a similar way than the hierarchical clustering of the bottom - up cdm picture .",
    "then , at large scales , bec perfectly mimic an ensemble of cold particles , while at small scales quantum mechanics drives the mass distribution .",
    "the properties of the bose - einstein condensed dark matter halos , as well as their cosmological implications , have been intensively investigate recently . the recently observed size evolution of very massive compact galaxies in the early universe can be explained , if dark matter is in a bose einstein condensate state @xcite .",
    "the size of the dark matter halos and galaxies depends on the correlation length of dark matter and , hence , on the expansion of the universe .",
    "the bec predicts that the size of the galaxies increases as the hubble radius of the universe even without merging , which agrees well with the recent observational data . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the finite length scale of the condensate dark matter can explain the recently observed common central mass of the milky way satellites ( @xmath17 ) independent of their luminosity , if the mass of the dark matter particle is about @xmath18 ev .",
    "the validity of the bec model on the galactic scale by using observed rotation curves was tested in @xcite by comparing the tangential velocity equation of the model with a sample of eight rotation curves of dwarf galaxies .",
    "a good agreement was found between the theoretically predicted rotation curves ( without any baryonic component ) and the observational data .",
    "the mean value of the logarithmic inner slope of the mass density profile of dwarf galaxies was also obtained , and it was shown that the observed value of this parameter is in agreement with the theoretical results .",
    "the study of the galactic rotation curves in the bec model was considered in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the bec model predicts that all galaxies must be very similar and exist for bigger redshifts than in the @xmath0cdm model . in @xcite",
    "the fits of high - resolution rotation curves of a sample of thirteen low surface brightness galaxies were compared with fits obtained using a navarro - frenk - white and pseudo - isothermal ( pi ) profiles . a better agreement with the bec model and pi profiles was found .",
    "the mean value of the logarithmic inner density slopes is -0.27 + /-",
    "a natural way to define the core radius , with the advantage of being model - independent , was also introduced . using this new definition in the bec density profile",
    "it was found that the recent observation of the constant dark matter central surface density can be reproduced .",
    "the bec model gives a similar fit to the navarro - frenk - white dark matter model for all high surface brightness ( hsb ) and low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies in a sample of 9 galaxies @xcite .",
    "for dark matter dominated dwarf galaxies the addition of the bec component improved more upon the purely baryonic fit than the nfw component .",
    "thus despite the sharp cut - off of the halo density , the bec dark matter candidate is consistent with the rotation curve data of all types of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of rotating bose condensate galactic dark matter halos , made of an ultralight spinless bosons , and the impact of the halo rotation on the galactic rotation curves was analyzed in @xcite .",
    "finite temperature effects on dark matter halos were analyzed in @xcite , where the condensed dark matter and thermal cloud density and mass profiles at finite temperatures were explicitly obtained .",
    "the obtained results show that when the temperature of the condensate and of the thermal cloud are much smaller than the critical bose - einstein transition temperature , the zero temperature density and mass profiles give an excellent description of the dark matter halos .",
    "the angular momentum and vortices in bec galactic dark matter halos were studied in @xcite-@xcite , respectively .    in @xcite",
    "it was proposed that the dark matter content of galaxies consist of a cold bosonic fluid , composed of weakly interacting slim particles ( wisps ) , represented by spin-0 axion - like particles and spin-1 hidden bosons , thermalized in the bose - einstein condensation state and bounded by their self - gravitational potential . by comparing this model with data obtained from 42 spiral galaxies and 19 low surface brightness galaxies ,",
    "the dark matter particle mass was constrained to the range @xmath19 ev , and the lower bound for the scattering length was found to be of the order of @xmath20 fm .",
    "the possibility that due to their superfluid properties some compact astrophysical objects may contain a significant part of their matter in the form of a bose - einstein condensate was investigated in @xcite . to study the condensate the gross - pitaevskii equation was used , with arbitrary non - linearity . in this way a large class of stable astrophysical objects was obtained , whose basic astrophysical parameters ( mass and radius ) sensitively depend on the mass of the condensed particle , and on the scattering length .    the bose - einstein condensation process in a cosmological context , by assuming that this process can be described ( at least approximately ) as a first order phase transition was studied in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the presence of the condensate dark matter and of the bose - einstein phase transition could have modified drastically the cosmological evolution of the early universe , as well as the large scale structure formation process .",
    "the effects of the finite dark matter temperature on the properties of the bose - einstein condensed dark matter halos were analyzed , in a cosmological context , in @xcite .",
    "the basic equations describing the finite temperature condensate , representing a generalized gross - pitaevskii equation that takes into account the presence of the thermal cloud were formulated .",
    "the static condensate and thermal cloud in thermodynamic equilibrium was analyzed in detail , by using the hartree - fock - bogoliubov and thomas - fermi approximations .",
    "it was also shown that finite temperature effects may play an important role in the early stages of the cosmological evolution of the dark matter condensates .",
    "the cosmological perturbations in the cosmological models with condensed dark matter were studied in @xcite .",
    "the large scale perturbative dynamics of the bec dark matter in a model where this component coexists with baryonic matter and cosmological constant was investigated in @xcite .",
    "the perturbative dynamics was studied using neo- newtonian cosmology ( where the pressure is dynamically relevant for the homogeneous and isotropic background ) which is assumed to be correct for small values of the sound speed .",
    "bec dark matter effects can be seen in the matter power spectrum if the mass of the condensate particle lies in the range @xmath21 , leading to a small , but perceptible , excess of power at large scales .",
    "simulation codes that are designed to study the behavior of the dark matter galactic halos in the form of a bose - einstein condensate were developed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that once appropriate choices for the dark matter particle mass and scattering length are made , the galactic dark matter halos composed by axion - like bose - einstein condensed particles , trapped by a self - gravitating potential , may be stable in the thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "the validity of the thomas - fermi approximation for the halo system was also discussed , and it was shown that the kinetic energy contribution is indeed negligible .",
    "the thomas - fermi approximation for the study of the condensed dark matter halos was also discussed in @xcite .",
    "the thomas - fermi approximation is based on the assumption that in the presence of a large number of particles , the kinetic term in the gross - pitaevskii energy functional can be neglected .",
    "however , this assumption is violated near the condensate surface .",
    "it was also shown that the total energy of the self - gravitating condensate in the thomas - fermi approximation is positive .",
    "a major recent experimental advance in the study of the bose - einstein condensation processes was the observation of the collapse and subsequent explosion of the condensates @xcite .",
    "a dynamical study of an attractive @xmath22rb bec in an axially symmetric trap was done , where the interatomic interaction was manipulated by changing the external magnetic field , thus exploiting a nearby feshbach resonance . in the vicinity of a feshbach resonance the atomic scattering length a can be varied over a huge range , by adjusting an external magnetic field .",
    "consequently , the sign of the scattering length is changed , thus transforming a repulsive condensate of @xmath22rb atoms into an attractive one , which naturally evolves into a collapsing and exploding condensate .    from a simple physical point of view",
    "the collapse of the bose - einstein condensates can be described as follows . when the number of particles becomes sufficiently large , so that @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a critical number , the attractive inter - particle energy overcomes the quantum pressure , and the condensate implodes .",
    "in the course of the implosion stage , the density of particles increases in the small vicinity of the trap center .",
    "when it approaches a certain critical value , a fraction of the particles gets expelled . in a time period of an order of few milliseconds ,",
    "the condensate again stabilizes .",
    "there are two observable components at the final stage of the collapse : remnant and burst particles .",
    "the remnant particles are those which remain in the condensate .",
    "the burst particles have an energy much larger than that of the condensed particles .",
    "there is also a fraction of particles , which is not observable .",
    "this fraction is referred to as the missing particles @xcite .",
    "the study of the bose - einstein collapse within a model of a gas of free bosons described by a semi - classical fokker - planck equation was performed in @xcite and @xcite . a striking similarity between the bose - einstein condensation in the canonical ensemble , and the gravitational collapse of a gas of classical self - gravitating brownian particles",
    "was found .",
    "it was also shown that at the bose - einstein condensation temperature @xmath25 , the chemical potential @xmath26 vanishes exponentially with a universal rate .",
    "after @xmath27 , the finite time interval in which @xmath28 vanishes , the mass of the condensate grows linearly with time , and saturates exponentially to its equilibrium value for large times @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to study the dynamics of gravitationally self - bound bose - einstein dark matter condensates of collisionless particles , without exterior trapping potentials . in particular , we focus on the description , mechanism and properties of the condensate collapse . in order to study the gravitational collapse , and to solve the gross - pitaevskii equation describing the dynamics of the condensate",
    ", we employ a variational method . by appropriately choosing a trial wave function ,",
    "the dynamical evolution of the condensate can be described by an effective time - dependent action , with the equation of motion of the condensate being given by the equation of motion of a single particle in an effective potential .",
    "the effective potential contains the contributions of the zero point kinetic energy , of the gravitational energy , and of the interaction energy , respectively .",
    "the effective equation of motion of the collapsing dark matter condensate is studied by using both analytical and numerical methods .",
    "the collapse of the condensate ends with the formation of a stable astrophysical configuration , corresponding to the minimum of the effective potential . the radius and the mass of the resulting dark matter object",
    "are obtained , as well as the collapse time of the condensate by numerically solving the effective equation of motion .",
    "approximate expressions for the radius of the stable configuration and of the collapse time are also obtained .",
    "the numerical values of these global astrophysical quantities , characterizing condensed dark matter systems , strongly depend on the two parameters describing the condensate , the mass of the dark matter particle , and of the scattering length , respectively . the stability of the condensate under small perturbations is also studied , and the oscillations frequency of the halo is obtained . hence the results obtained in the present paper show that the gravitational collapse of the condensed dark matter halos can lead to the formation of stable astrophysical systems on both galactic and stellar scales .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "the basic physical properties of the static bose - einstein condensed dark matter halos are reviewed briefly in section  [ sect2 ] . the variational formulation of the gross - pitaevskii equation , the choice of the trial wave function , and the formulation of the effective dynamics of the condensate as a motion of a single particle in an effective potential are presented in section  [ sect3 ] . the physical parameters of the time dependent dark matter halos ( density , gravitational potential , and the physical parameters of the effective potential ) are determined , within the framework of the variational approach in section  [ sect4 ] .",

    "the stability properties of the dark matter halos formed after the gravitational collapse are investigated in section section  [ sectnn ] .",
    "we discuss and conclude our results in section  [ sect6 ] .",
    "in the following we assume that the dark matter halos are composed of a strongly - coupled , dilute bose - einstein condensate at absolute zero temperature . therefore almost all the dark matter particles are in the condensate . in a dilute and cold gas , only binary collisions at low energy are relevant , and , hence , independently of the details of the two - body potential , the collisions are characterized by a single physical parameter , the @xmath29-wave scattering length @xmath30 .",

    "we have discussed a number of observational constraints ( galactic radii and bullet cluster data ) that provide some limits for @xmath34 and @xmath30 . within the framework of the bose - einstein condensed dark matter model these astrophysical constraints point towards a dark matter particle with mass in the range of mev to a few ev , and a scattering length of the order of @xmath312 cm . however , in the present paper most of the numerical results are normalized for a scattering length of @xmath313 cm , and a mass of the dark matter particle of the order of @xmath314 g. by a simple scaling all the numerical values corresponding to other choices of @xmath34 and @xmath30 can be obtained easily .",
    "we have also considered the stability properties of the stable dark matter halos with respect to small oscillations , and the oscillations frequencies of the halos have also been obtained .",
    "these results show that the stable configuration , formed from the collapse of the condensed dark matter halos are stable with respect to small perturbations .",
    "a large number of astrophysical observations , including the flat galactic cores , or the constant density surfaces points towards the possibility that dark matter may exist in the universe in the form of a bose - einstein condensate , and that this possibility can not be excluded _ a priori_. the confirmation of this hypothesis by further observations on both galactic and cosmological scales would lead to a major change in our understanding of the basic principles of cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "in the present papers we have developed some theoretical tools that can help in the better understanding of the structure formation in the presence of condensed dark matter .",

    "<S> we study the mechanisms of the gravitational collapse of the bose - einstein condensate dark matter halos , described by the zero temperature time - dependent nonlinear schrdinger equation ( the gross - pitaevskii equation ) , with repulsive inter - particle interactions . by using a variational approach , and by choosing an appropriate trial wave function , </S>",
    "<S> we reformulate the gross - pitaevskii equation with spherical symmetry as newton s equation of motion for a particle in an effective potential , which is determined by the zero point kinetic energy , the gravitational energy , and the particles interaction energy , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity of the condensate is proportional to the radial distance , with a time dependent proportionality function . </S>",
    "<S> the equation of motion of the collapsing dark matter condensate is studied by using both analytical and numerical methods . </S>",
    "<S> the collapse of the condensate ends with the formation of a stable configuration , corresponding to the minimum of the effective potential . the radius and the mass of the resulting dark matter object </S>",

    "<S> the numerical values of these global astrophysical quantities , characterizing condensed dark matter systems , strongly depend on the two parameters describing the condensate , the mass of the dark matter particle , and of the scattering length , respectively </S>",
    "<S> . the stability of the condensate under small perturbations is also studied , and the oscillations frequency of the halo is obtained . hence these results show that the gravitational collapse of the condensed dark matter halos can lead to the formation of stable astrophysical systems with both galactic and stellar sizes . </S>"
