    "it is by now an accepted paradigm that the formation of globular clusters ( gcs ) is closely linked to the formation of their host galaxies ( e.g. searle & zinn  1978 , ashman & zepf  1992 , kissler - patig  1997 , hilker _",

    "studies of extragalactic gcs have tended to focus on correlations between the global photometric properties of the gc systems ( gcss ) and those of their host galaxy .",
    "for instance , peng  @xcite , examined the color distributions for gcs belonging to 100 galaxies observed in the acs virgo cluster survey ( acsvcs ; ct  2004 ; see also below ) , finding nearly all of these galaxies ( @xmath7 mag ) to possess bimodal , or at least asymmetric , gc color distributions .",
    "consistent with previous findings ( e.g. , gebhardt & kissler - patig  1999 ; kundu  2001 ; larsen  2001 ) , the mean gc color was found to correlate with galaxy luminosity in the same sense as the well - known color - magnitude relation for early type galaxies ( e.g. bower , lucey & ellis  1992 ; karick  2003 ; hilker  2003 ; ferrarese  2006 ) .",
    "a corresponding gc color - galaxy color relation was also found by peng  @xcite , confirming previous findings ( e.g. , burgarella  2001 ; larsen  2001 ; lotz  2004 ) .    at the same time",
    ", analyses of the color magnitude diagrams for the gcss of early - type galaxies revealed some tentative evidence for a dependence of _ individual _ gc color on luminosity .",
    "ostrov  @xcite found from washington photometry of ngc 1399 that the color peaks of the gc color distribution seem to merge at the highest luminosities .",
    "dirsch et al .",
    "@xcite confirmed this finding for the same galaxy based on an expanded sample of gcs .",
    "there have also been hints of such a behavior in other galaxies such as ngc 5128 ( harris  2004 ) and m87 ( whitmore  1995 ; larsen  2001 ) .    with the improved imaging capabilities of hst provided by the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ; ford  1998 ) , it has become possible to investigate this issue in more detail .",
    "harris  @xcite used acs imaging to investigate the distribution of gcs in the @xmath8 color magnitude plane for eight brightest cluster galaxies in the range @xmath9 km s@xmath10 . for the four galaxies with the largest number of gcs  and also the joint sample of eight gc systems  they found a significant trend towards redder colors for increasing luminosity for the subpopulation of blue gcs .",
    "this finding led them to suggest a mass - metallicity relation of the form @xmath11 for this subpopulation .",
    "curiously , no color - magnitude relation was found for the red gcs .",
    "strader  @xcite used the publicly available data from the acsvcs to look for color - magnitude trends in the three brightest virgo cluster galaxies m49 , m87 and m60 . for the blue gc populations of m87 and m60",
    ", they found a significant trend of redder color with brighter gc @xmath12-band luminosity similar to that found by harris  @xcite .",
    "they too interpreted this trend as evidence for a mass - metallicity relation among the blue ( metal - poor ) gcs and suggested self - enrichment as a possible explanation .",
    "no significant color - magnitude trend was found for m49 , the brightest member of the virgo cluster .",
    "both the harris  @xcite and strader  @xcite studies used heteroscedastic mixture models to fit the colors of an assumed double - gaussian color distribution to the observed gc color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) as a function of magnitude .",

    "note that the harris  @xcite study targeted only brightest cluster galaxies , so it spanned a relatively limited range in galaxy luminosity .",

    "special emphasis will be put on environmental dependencies of this trend and checks of the fitting technique .",

    "we examine a variety of physical effects that may create these trends .",
    "we finish this paper with the summary and conclusions in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the acsvcs represents the most complete and homogeneous study of extragalactic gcs performed to date .",
    "the sample consists of 100 early - type ( e , s0 , de , de , n , ds0 ) members of the virgo cluster .",
    "each galaxy was imaged in the f475w and f850lp filters ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively ) for a total of 750 seconds and 1210 seconds , respectively .",
    "this filter combination gives roughly a factor - of - two improvement in wavelength baseline and metallicity sensitivity compared to the `` canonical '' @xmath17 color index .",
    "the identification of bona - fide gcs from these images is performed in the size - magnitude plane as described in peng @xcite .",
    "this selection procedure  which is possible because the half - light radii of gcs are marginally resolved ( jordn @xcite ) at the distance of virgo ( @xmath18 mpc ; tonry @xcite ; mei @xcite )  greatly reduces contamination from foreground stars and background galaxies .",
    "the acs images had been reduced using a dedicated pipeline described in detail by jordn ( 2004ab ; papers  ii and iii ) . in brief , the reduction steps are : image combination , galaxy modeling and model subtraction , rejection of obvious background galaxies , and the measurement of magnitudes and sizes for candidate gcs using the program kingphot ( jordn 2005 ; paper x ) . the result is a catalog of integrated @xmath13 and @xmath12 magnitudes , @xmath2 colors and half - light radii , @xmath19 , for each candidate gc .",
    "magnitudes and colors are corrected for foreground extinction using the reddening maps of schlegel  @xcite .    to estimate the contamination by background galaxies ,",
    "an identical reduction procedure was applied to 17 blank high - latitude fields observed by acs in the @xmath13 and @xmath12 filters . because background galaxies are typically larger at comparable luminosities ( or , conversely , fainter at comparable sizes )",
    ", a statistical decontamination is performed in size - magnitude space ( see peng  2006 and jordn 2006 , in prep . for details ) : to this end , first a non - parametric density model is fitted to the size - magnitude distribution of sources detected in background fields . for the gc candidate magnitude distribution , a gaussian luminosity function is assumed .",
    "the gc candidate size distribution is fitted by a non - parametric kernel estimate plus a power law tail .",
    "the resulting surface densities in the size - magnitude plane for background sources and gcs then make it possible to assign a gc probability , @xmath20 , to every source detected in the galaxy image .",
    "all candidates with probabilities @xmath21 are considered gcs .",
    "the remaining contamination by background galaxies that are assigned @xmath21 is negligible for the sake of this study .",
    "we have tested this by statistically cleaning the gc cmds for each galaxy , using the color - magnitude distribution of sources with @xmath22 in the 17 blank background fields .",
    "figure  [ cmd1316 ] shows @xmath6-@xmath2 and @xmath3-@xmath2 cmds for the gcs of m87 (= ngc4486 = vcc1316 ) , the central galaxy of the virgo cluster and the galaxy with the singlest largest population of gcs . for comparison ,",
    "figure  [ cmdclasses ] shows the co - added cmds for the 79 acsvcs galaxies that have reliable sbf distances ( mei 2005 , 2006 ) and which have a discernible gc population ( see peng 2006 ) .",
    "we use the sbf distance moduli from mei  ( 2005 , 2006 ) , which have an internal precision of @xmath23  mag , to assign absolute magnitudes to the associated gc candidates . to better visualize trends across host galaxy magnitude ,",
    "the 79 galaxies are subdivided into four broad luminosity groups such that the number of gcs per group falls in the range @xmath24 2400 to 3300 .",
    "luminosity group 1 consists of the three brightest avcvcs galaxies m49 (= ngc4472 = vcc1226 ; @xmath25 mag ) , m87 (= ngc4486 = vcc1316 ; @xmath26 mag ) , and m60 (= ngc4649 = vcc1978 ; @xmath27 mag ) .",
    "group 2 consists of six acsvcs galaxies with @xmath28  mag .",
    "group 3 consists of 17 acsvcs galaxies with @xmath29  mag .",
    "the remaining 53 acsvcs galaxies with @xmath30  mag make up group 4 .",
    "the three galaxies in group 1 are all so - called `` core - srsic galaxies '' ( ferrarese 2006 ) , while those in groups 2 and 3 are a mixture of core - srsic and srsic elliptical and lenticular galaxies .",
    "the 53 galaxies in group 4 consist mainly , but not exclusively , of early - type dwarfs ( e.g. , de , de , n , ds0 and ds0,n ) .",
    "we have applied to the combined cmds for these four groups , as well as to the individual cmds for the three galaxies in group 1 . to this end",
    ", we subdivided the cmds into luminosity bins , each bin containing the same number of data points .",
    "for the cmds of m49 and m60 , the size of each luminosity bin is 100 , for m87 the size is 150 , and for the combined cmds the bin size is 200 gcs .",
    "was then run on the gc color distribution in each luminosity bin . as in the paper by harris _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite , we use the heteroscedastic option of kmm : we allow for gaussians of different widths to be fitted to the blue and red gc populations .",
    "the fitted mean positions are plotted over the respective cmds in figures  [ cmd1316 ] and [ cmdclasses ] .",
    "we show the results for two different initial guesses for the mean colors of the blue and red gc populations : one for the pair @xmath31 and 1.2  mag , another one for @xmath32 and 1.4  mag .",
    "these different guesses were chosen to cover : ( 1 ) the range of peak positions between cmds of the various luminosity groups ; and ( 2 ) the range caused by the color - magnitude trend itself ( see figure  [ cmdclasses ] ) .",
    "linear slopes between color and absolute magnitude are obtained from ordinary least square fits to the peak positions for both pairs of initial guesses , fitting color as a function of magnitude .",
    "gcs fainter than @xmath33  mag and @xmath34  mag were excluded from the fits , to avoid effects of photometric incompleteness on the measured slopes .",
    "the mean of both fits is adopted as the final best - fit slope .",
    "the fit errors of the slope are derived from re - sampling the points using as dispersion the observed scatter around the fitted relation .",
    "we note that this scatter is for all luminosity groups larger ( by 30% for luminosity group 1 and by 100% for group 4 ) than the average statistical error estimate for the peak position , given by @xmath35 .",
    "here , @xmath36 is the width of the gaussian peak and @xmath37 the average number of gcs per magnitude bin associated to the peak .",
    "we are therefore confident that our error estimates are not too optimistic .",
    "for the few cases where the difference between the results obtained using the two initial guesses was larger than the formal fit errors , we adopted the difference as the error .",
    "the resulting slopes of those fits are shown in table  [ fitresults ] .",
    "we first consider @xmath3 vs. @xmath2 for group 1 . in this case",
    ", we detect a very significant slope @xmath38 for the blue peak position . when restricting the fit to @xmath39 mag ( i.e. , rejecting the two brightest magnitude bins in figure  [ cmdclasses ] ) , the result is @xmath40 .",
    "this is significant at the 4.5@xmath36 level , indicating that the color - magnitude trend is _ not _ restricted to just the brightest gcs . for m87 and m60 alone ,",
    "a comparable slope is derived , albeit at somewhat lower ( @xmath41 ) significance .",
    "the slope for m49 is consistent with zero , in agreement with the findings of strader  @xcite . when excluding m49 from group 1 , the slope for the blue population rises slightly to @xmath42 .",
    "the non - detection of a color - magnitude trend for m49 is intriguing , since this galaxy has a similar number of gcs as m60 and is similar to m60 and m87 in terms of luminosity , color , surface brightness and gc dynamics ( peng 2006 ; ferrarese 2006 ; mei  2005 ; ct 2001 ; 2003 ) .",
    "the fact that m49 is located at the center of its own sub - cluster  being offset by @xmath43 from the virgo cluster center  may hint at some environmental effect on the strength of the observed color - magnitude trend .",
    "in contrast to the strong correlation @xmath5 exhibited by the blue gcs in group 1 , @xmath5 is insignificant for the red gcs in this group .",
    "however , the situation changes when using @xmath6 instead of @xmath3 as magnitude in the color - magnitude diagram ( see table  [ fitresults ] ) .",
    "the slope @xmath44 for the blue population is more than 50% smaller than @xmath5 and , as a result , has a lower level of significance ( 1.7@xmath36 . )",
    "considered individually , @xmath45 of the blue population becomes insignificant for all three galaxies in this group . in turn , the slope @xmath45 of the red population becomes marginally positive  i.e. , opposite in sense to that defined by @xmath5 for the blue population .    [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     notes : analogous to table  [ fitresults ] .",
    "difference is that peak positions are now defined by the biweight of the color distribution blue- and redwards of a luminosity independent limiting color , see fig .",
    "[ normal ] .",
    "[ slopes ] graphically compares the fits to and biweight peak positions for all four luminosity groups .",
    "the difference in slopes between @xmath12 and @xmath13 raises the question as to what the `` true '' slope actually is . to investigate this issue in more detail ,",
    "we compare in figure  [ cmd3brightsim ] the actual measurements for group 1 with two sets of 20 monte - carlo simulations for the m87 cmd .",
    "the first set of cmds has an implemented slope @xmath46 for the blue gcs corresponding to @xmath47 is of course not identical to @xmath5 , but this difference is negligible for the sake of this study : @xmath48 and @xmath49 for the red ones ; the other set has @xmath49 implemented for either gc population .",
    "these artificial cmds were created by assuming the average peak widths derived by for the blue and red gcs , taking into account also the photometric errors on the colors .",
    "the luminosity function is sampled from a kernel estimator of the original cmd of m87 , separately for each color peak .",
    "figure  [ compsim ] compares the real and simulated m87 cmd with an implemented slope .",
    "note an important feature of those cmds : the red peak is populated to brighter absolute luminosities in @xmath3 than in @xmath6 , while the blue peak does not show such a difference .",
    "this is because , relative to gcs in the blue population , gcs in the red population are brighter in @xmath3 than in @xmath6 .",
    "table  [ fitresults ] gives the slopes fitted to the mean colors from for the two simulated sets of m87 cmds , together with the slopes for the real data .",
    "this comparison shows that both the cmd of m87 alone , and that for the co - added cmd of group 1 , are inconsistent with a magnitude independent color for the blue gcs . the data are consistent with a simulated slope of 0.040 for the blue gcs and no slope for the red gcs .    note the positive slope found for the red gcs in both the real and simulated data in @xmath6 .",
    "averaging over the 20 simulated cmds , the mean red slope of @xmath500.03 is different from zero at the 5.7@xmath36 level . that finding is noteworthy since the simulations do _",
    "not _ implement a slope for the red peak .",
    "this exercise therefore demonstrates an important caveat of the fitting : at a given magnitude , as one of the two peaks becomes de - populated ( in this case the red peak in @xmath6 ) , its position will artificially be dragged towards the position of the more prominent peak . as a consequence",
    ", the mean color of the blue population will be artificially shifted towards bluer colors .",
    "this results in a weaker slope for the blue peak in @xmath6 than in @xmath3 . in @xmath3 ,",
    "both peaks are populated up to comparable absolute luminosities , and therefore the fitted slopes for both red and blue peaks correspond to the simulated ones .",
    "that is to say , only the _ weaker _ slope in @xmath6 is caused by a bias .",
    "does not artificially introduce the very significant negative slope in the blue @xmath3 peak : this is clearly a real trend that is intrinsic to the data .",
    "when interpreting the slope as a mass - metallicity relation for gcs in the blue peak , we derive a scaling @xmath51 by combining the slope @xmath52 - 0.037 found in the previous section with @xmath53}}{d(g - z ) } = 5.14~{\\rm dex~mag^{-1}}\\ ] ] from peng  @xcite and assuming a constant mass - to - light ratio over the luminosity range investigated .",
    "this is in good agreement with the scaling relation @xmath54 found by harris  @xcite .    as an alternative to kmm",
    ", we have calculated the biweight location ( beers  1990 ) for the gc subpopulations blue - wards and red - wards of a magnitude independent limiting color .",
    "this limiting color is the mean of the position of the blue and red populations , weighted by the average width of either peak .",
    "the results for this alternative method are shown in table  [ fitresultsnaive ] .",
    "as an example , we show in fig .",
    "[ normal ] the peak positions for groups 1 and 4 in @xmath3 .",
    "generally speaking , the errors for this biweight method decrease significantly compared to the data points , and the results confirm the significant slope found for the blue gc population .",
    "they also confirm that no significant correlation is found for m49 .",
    "table  [ fitresultsnaive ] and figure  [ slopes ] show that the difference between fits in @xmath6 and @xmath3 is considerably smaller than in the case of kmm .",
    "nevertheless , this alternative method is itself not immune to biases , as is clear when it is applied it to the simulated cmds ( see table  [ fitresultsnaive ] and figure  [ slopes ] ) . in the case of the blue population exhibiting a negative slope , a fixed limiting magnitude between both populations will systematically decrease the absolute slope of the blue population , and introduce an artificial positive slope for the red .",
    "having examined how specific features of the cmd may influence the fitted color - magnitude relations for the blue and red gc populations , we now investigate the extent to which possible environmental effects may influence the observed trends .",
    "figure  [ cmdclasses ] shows cmds for groups 14 with the peaks over - plotted .",
    "derived slopes for the color - magnitude relations in each group are presented in tables  [ fitresults ]  and  [ fitresultsnaive ] .",
    "the dependence of slope on host galaxy magnitude is illustrated in figure  [ slopes ] .",
    "the fits in @xmath3 show that the slope of the blue gcs in groups 2 and 3 are indistinguishable from that for group 1 ; in all three groups , the slope is inconsistent with zero at about the 3@xmath36 level .",
    "this indicates that the color - magnitude trend among metal - poor gcs is _ not _ restricted to just the brightest galaxies . only for group 4",
    "does the measured slope of the blue population become consistent with zero .",
    "the biweight fits in the lower panels of figure  [ slopes ] paint a similar picture : the slope decreases only gradually from group 1 to 4 , and apparently does not drop to zero .",
    "given that the biweight fits systematically underestimate the blue slope , this is an indication that the color magnitude trend persists over the entire magnitude range of the acsvcs galaxies .",
    "the trend for the red gcs determined using becomes progressively more uncertain for fainter galaxy magnitudes .",
    "this is because of the decreasing fraction of red ( metal - rich ) gcs with decreasing host galaxy luminosity ( peng  2006 ) .",
    "the firmest result from figure  [ slopes ] regarding the color - magnitude relation for red gcs is that there is no strong @xmath3 slope for the two brightest groups ; the slopes for the two faintest galaxy groups have large uncertainties .",
    "the large positive slopes found in @xmath6 are particularly prone to biases , a conclusion that is confirmed by looking at the more robust biweight fit results .",
    "the comparison between the biweight fits to the real data and the simulations shows that the slope of the red population is consistent with zero over the full luminosity range .",
    "an interesting feature of the observed color - magnitude relations is illustrated in figure  [ radial ] .",
    "here we subdivide the gc samples of groups 1 and 2 by galactocentric radius into equally - sized ,  inner \" and  outer \" subsamples .",
    "as the dividing radius , we choose @xmath55 , which translates to a physical distance of @xmath56  kpc at the distance of the virgo cluster . in terms of the effective radii , @xmath57 , of the host galaxies in groups 1 and 2 ,",
    "this fixed dividing radius corresponds to @xmath58 0.30.6  @xmath57 ( ferrarese 2006 ) .",
    "tables  [ fitresults ]  and  [ fitresultsnaive ] report the slopes for the different subsamples . for group 1 ,",
    "the slope found for the inner gcs is a factor of @xmath58 23 higher than that for the outer gcs . both the and biweight methods support this conclusion , at significance levels of 2.2@xmath36 and 2.5@xmath36 , respectively . for the combined group 1 + 2 samples ,",
    "the fits still obtain a difference of about a factor of three ( at 2.9@xmath36 significance ) , while the differences are almost insignificant for the biweight fits .    in figure  [ sizecolor ] , we plot color vs. half - light radius for gcs with @xmath59 mag , separated into inner and outer samples .",
    "there is a small size offset between the inner and outer sample , in the sense that outer gcs are larger by about 10% .",
    "this dependence of @xmath19 on galactocentric radius has already been investigated by jordn @xcite . in figure",
    "[ colorhist ] , we plot the color histograms for two luminosity ranges : in the left panel , we show gcs in the same luminosity range as in figure  [ sizecolor ] ; in the right panel , we show gcs in the range @xmath60  mag .",
    "clearly , the gap between the two peaks is larger among the fainter sample of gcs , a consequence of the color - magnitude trend .",
    "furthermore , for the brighter gcs , the inner and outer color histograms appear to differ more than for the fainter gcs .",
    "the ks probability with which the inner and outer sample of the bright gcs have the same underlying distribution is 1% , while it is 14% for the faint sample . indeed , while the bimodality feature is still notable for the outer bright gcs , it is slightly smeared out for the bright , inner gcs",
    "this suggests that the dependence of the color - magnitude relation on galactocentric distance is driven mainly by the bright gcs ( @xmath61 mag ) .",
    "figure  [ colorhist ] also shows that the fraction of blue - to - red gcs decreases slightly for smaller galactocentric distance ( see also , e.g. , dirsch 2003 ) .",
    "the corresponding fractions of blue - to - red gcs are 0.45:0.55 and 0.50:0.50 for the inner and outer gcs , respectively .",
    "it is apparent from the color histograms in figure  [ colorhist ] that this small effect can not be responsible for the steeper color - magnitude relation found for the inner sample of gcs .      before proceeding ,",
    "we pause to compare the distribution of gcs in the cmd with those of other stellar systems : i.e. , the nuclei of acsvcs galaxies , the acsvcs galaxies themselves , and some candidate ultra - compact dwarf galaxies ( ucds ) identified in the course of the acsvcs .    figure  [ cmdallobjects ] compares the combined cmd of gcs ( red circles ) , compact stellar nuclei ( asterisks ; ct  2006 ) , acsvcs galaxies ( green circles ; ferrarese  2006 ) and ucds ( open squares ; haegan 2005 ) . in this figure , we have converted from @xmath3 to stellar masses using the population synthesis models of bruzual & charlot  @xcite under the assumption of a 10-gyr old population and a chabrier imf ( chabrier  2003 ) . for comparison , we also show the color - magnitude relation for early - type galaxies in the fornax cluster from hilker  @xcite , after converting from @xmath17 to @xmath2 using the transformation of fukugita  @xcite .    the majority of the blue gcs are not consistent with an extrapolation of the galaxy color - magnitude relation , nor with that of the nuclei .",
    "moreover , the color - magnitude relations of the nuclei and the galaxies are steeper than that of the gcs .",
    "only the faintest nuclei appear to be roughly consistent with the color - magnitude relation observed for the blue gcs . in any case , we point out that the existence of a color - magnitude trend for the blue gcs results in a paucity of gcs at high luminosities and blue colors : i.e. , @xmath62 mag and @xmath63 mag .",
    "it is difficult to understand how contamination of the observed cmds by some unrecognized stellar system  stripped nuclei , ultra - compact dwarfs ( ucds ) , or otherwise  can lead to an underpopulation of this region of the cmd .",
    "as a starting point for this discussion , we summarize the two main findings thus far , both of which concern dependencies of the measured color - magnitude slope on external factors : ( 1 ) the slope for the blue gcs decreases gradually towards fainter host galaxy luminosities , whereas there is no significant color - magnitude relation for the red gcs ; and ( 2 ) the slope is steeper for gcs which lie closer to the centers of their host galaxies .",
    "we now discuss a number of scenarios that that might help explain the observed trend : ( 1 ) contamination by super star clusters , stripped nuclei , or ucds ; ( 2 ) accretion of gcs from low - mass galaxies ; ( 3 ) stochastic effects ; ( 4 ) capture of field stars by individual gcs ; and ( 5 ) gc self enrichment . in  [ metallicity ] , we briefly discuss how the observed color - magnitude trends appear after transforming into the metallicity - mass plane .    [ discussion ]      one idea that may explain the slope difference between inner and outer gcs is the presence of overluminous star clusters of intermediate color that may lie close to the galaxy centers . such a putative population would populate the region between the two color sequences at high luminosities . merged super star clusters ( e.g. , fellhauer & kroupa  2002 , 2005 ; kissler - patig  2006 ) could , in principle , be those objects .",
    "they are expected to be more extended than their monolithic counterparts of equal mass ( e.g. , bekki  2004 ; fellhauer & kroupa  2002 ; bastian  2005 ) . however , in the size vs. color plot shown in figure  [ sizecolor ] it is the _ outer _",
    "gcs that are slightly larger .",
    "more importantly , there is no offset in the size distribution for the inner gcs with intermediate colors ( i.e. , @xmath64  mag ) .",
    "this makes the presence of a large number of merged star clusters unlikely .",
    "another possibility is the presence of  naked \" or tidally stripped de , n nuclei , as suggested by harris  @xcite ( see also bassino _ et  al .",
    "_ 1994 ) . the de , n nuclei of virgo cluster galaxies do exhibit a color - magnitude trend and have colors comparable to those of the blue gcs ( see , e.g. , lotz  2004 ; ct  2006 ; figure  [ cmdallobjects ] ) .",
    "ct  @xcite find a median half - light radius of @xmath65  pc for nuclei with @xmath59  mag .",
    "this is comparable to the sizes of gcs in this same luminosity range ( figure  [ sizecolor ] ) .",
    "stripped nuclei might therefore be confused with ",
    "normal \" blue gcs at the highest luminosities .",
    "however , as pointed out in  [ comparison ] , the overall distribution of gcs with the cmd shows a _ lack _ of bright , blue objects .",
    "very generally , this dearth is not explained by the addition of an  extra \" population of contaminators , but rather requires an underlying trend for most of the objects .",
    "stripped nuclei would have to dominate the population of blue gcs .",
    "this seems unlikely to us for several reasons .",
    "first , the nuclei luminosity function peaks @xmath58 24  mag brighter than that of gcs ( see lotz  2004 ; , ct  2006 , see also figure  [ cmdallobjects ] ) . more seriously , though , is the shear number of nuclei that would be required in this scenario .",
    "observationally , there is an upper limit on the number of naked nuclei brighter than @xmath66  mag from jones _",
    "et  al . _",
    "these authors found nine compact objects  ucds in their notation  with @xmath67 mag in a survey that is almost complete within the central degree of the virgo cluster ( excluding the 1 - 2  surrounding m87 ) .",
    "their nine compact objects are distributed over an area that is @xmath68 100@xmath69 the acs field of view , in qualitative agreement with the predictions by bekki _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for the spatial distribution of tidally stripped de , n nuclei .",
    "therefore , a presence of dozens , or possibly hundreds , of naked nuclei in our acs fields for the most luminous galaxies seems unlikely .    a final note regarding the possibility of ucds as contaminators : the two most discussed formation channels for these compact stellar systems are stripped de , n nuclei and merged stellar super - clusters ( e.g. minniti _ et al .",
    "1998 , hilker  1999a , drinkwater _ et al . _",
    "2003 , haegan  2005 , kissler - patig  2006 , mieske  2006 ) . since these two formation channels correspond to the two kinds of contaminators discussed in this section , we conclude that also ucds are unlikely to account for the observed trends .",
    "a population of gcs accreted from galaxies with a range of masses ( e.g. ct  1998 or hilker  1999b ) will exhibit a color - magnitude relation if : ( 1 ) the mean gc color of a single galaxy scales with galaxy mass ; and ( 2 ) more massive gcs preferentially form in more massive galaxies .",
    "indeed , both conditions are satisfied in actual early - type galaxies ( see , e.g. , peng  2005 ; kundu & whitmore  2001 ; jordn _ et  al .",
    "_ 2006 in prep . and",
    "references therein ) .",
    "moreover , this simple scenario may offer , at least in principal , a way to qualitatively understand the slope differences for individual galaxies ( e.g. , the non - existence of a correlation for m49 ) as a consequence of different accretion / merger histories .    in order to quantify the tilt in the cmd created by the accretion of gcs from low - mass galaxies that do not themselves have color - magnitude relations , we consider the combined gc sample of groups 24 ( see figure  [ cmdall ] ) .",
    "we first calculate the mean host galaxy magnitude for each bin , and then calculate the color in each gc bin according to the relation between host galaxy magnitude and mean color of the blue and red gc subpopulations ( table  3 of peng  2006 ) .",
    "the outcome of this exercise is shown in figure  [ cmdall ] . as expected",
    ", there is a ( weak ) trend between mean color with luminosity for the gc subpopulations .",
    "this trend is compared to the fits for group 1 .",
    "there is a substantial offset in the sense that the fainter luminosity groups have bluer gc colors than group 1 . in addition , the simulated slope is substantially smaller than measured for the ensemble of galaxies in group 1 .",
    "all in all , we conclude that the observed color - magnitude relations are unlikely to have been created by accretion of gcs from low - mass galaxies , although we can not rule out the possibility that accretion has contributed to the observed trend .",
    "the light of old gcs is in the red optical to near - infrared pass - bands dominated by red giant stars .",
    "generally , the number of red giants is only a small fraction of the total number of stars in a given stellar population .",
    "it is therefore worth discussing to which extent stochastic effects due to small numbers of red giants can skew the probability distribution of the integrated gc luminosity .",
    "this may cause a trend of gc color with integrated luminosity , because any stochastic effect is weaker for higher gc luminosity ( larger total number of stars ) and for bluer bands ( lower average stellar luminosity ) .    in the works by cervio  ( 2002 ) , and cervio & luridiana ( 2004 ; 2006 ) ,",
    "the effect of discrete isochrone sampling on integrated photometric properties is discussed in detail . in cervio & luridiana  ( 2006 ) ,",
    "the width , skewness and kurtosis for the probability distribution of integrated luminosity of a stellar population are calculated as a function of star number and age .",
    "the faint magnitude limit of our gcs ( @xmath70 mag ) corresponds to about 10@xmath71 , and hence about @xmath72 stars . in the @xmath73-band  taken to represent the @xmath12 band due to lack of estimates for the latter band ",
    ", the photometric uncertainty arising from sampling effects amounts to about 0.06 mag for such a population ( cervio & luridiana  ( 2006 ) ; and cervio , private communications ) .",
    "the skewness of the distribution in integrated luminosity is about 0.25 .",
    "the product of these two numbers  about 0.015 mag  is a measure of the difference between mode and mean of the probability distribution in integrated luminosity . given that the colour - magnitude trend in our data requires an almost ten times larger color shift , stochastic effects do probably not have a significant contribution to the observed trend .",
    "there is also a phenomenological counterargument against the importance of stochastic effects : the color - magnitude trend is shaped more by brighter gcs ( see figure  [ colorhist ] ) , while stochastic effects are stronger for fainter gcs .",
    "furthermore , the environmental dependencies of the trend can not be explained by purely intrinsic stochastic effects .",
    "given that the strength of the color - magnitude trend depends on local environment , it is reasonable to examine the extent to which capture of field stars may help to explain the observed slopes .",
    "the capture of field stars has previously been considered by bica  @xcite for the case of a 10@xmath74m@xmath75 star cluster orbiting within the galactic bulge at a distance of 1 kpc .",
    "they found that such a cluster could absorb a substantial fraction of its total mass during its lifetime .",
    "similarly , kroupa  @xcite has shown that stellar super - clusters created in disks like that of the milky way can capture several tens of percent of their total mass in form of disk stars .",
    "field stars of the brightest early - type galaxies are significantly redder than their blue gc population , typically by about 0.5 to 0.6 mag ( peng  2006 ) . therefore",
    ", there will be a color shift towards the red by about 0.10 - 0.15 for a blue gc by the time that @xmath58 20 - 25% of the gc light originates from field stars .",
    "this effect will be notable mainly for the blue gc population , since the color of red gcs is much closer to that of field stars . as will become clear from the subsequent discussion , the capture rate per unit gc mass is higher for more massive gcs , which will lead to a slope in color - magnitude space .",
    "this qualitatively explains finding ( 1 ) from above .",
    "in addition , the effect will be stronger in the inner part of the host galaxy because of the higher field star density in such regions , consistent with finding ( 2 ) .",
    "thus , field star capture seems qualitatively consistent with the observed trend .",
    "we now quantify this scenario by considering a gc with a mass of 10@xmath76 , a mass that roughly corresponds to the brightest clusters in groups 1 and 2 in figure  [ cmdclasses ] .",
    "for an assumed m / l=2.5 , this corresponds to a total of 4@xmath77 solar luminosities .",
    "we assume the gc to be on a circular orbit around m87 .",
    "this is certainly an extreme assumption , given that ct  @xcite rule out such tangentially biased orbits for the gc system _ as a whole_. we nevertheless use it for the sake of this simple estimate .",
    "we adopt a radius of 3 kpc , representative for the sample within 5 kpc projected galactocentric distance .",
    "we may estimate the number of captured stars by multiplying the total number of stars within the volume of influence of the gc with the fraction of stars having relative velocities below the gc escape velocity .",
    "as the volume of influence , we define a torus around the orbit of the gc with an inner radius of the gc s tidal radius with respect to its host galaxy m87 . for calculating the tidal radius , we use the mass profile of m87 derived by romanowsky & kochanek  @xcite .",
    "they quote the integrated mass at a distance of 3 kpc to be 1.1@xmath6910@xmath78 @xmath79 , which is comparable to the value found by ct  @xcite .",
    "together with the 10@xmath76 mass of the gc , this gives a tidal radius of 9 pc .",
    "the total volume of the torus then is 4.8@xmath80 pc@xmath81 .",
    "we use the same paper by romanowsky & kochanek to get the 3-dimensional stellar density of m87 at 3 kpc , which is about 0.06 l@xmath82 pc@xmath83 .",
    "that is , along one orbit there will be a total of 2.9 @xmath77 solar luminosities within the volume of influence of our test gc .",
    "however , only a small fraction of those will be captured : the average escape velocity @xmath84 of the gc within its tidal radius of 9pc is about 37 km  s@xmath10 , while the stellar velocity dispersion in m87 is about 275 km  s@xmath10 ( romanowsky & kochanek  2001 ) . the gc population in m87 has a velocity dispersion of @xmath68 400 km  s@xmath10 .",
    "the probability distribution for the relative velocity between the field stars and a gc is given by the convolution of both distributions , which is a gaussian of width @xmath36 = 485 km  s@xmath10 .",
    "the fraction of stars ( in solar luminosities ) that can be captured in the 1d case is given by the area below the gaussian between + /-",
    "@xmath85 , which is 0.035 . for the full 3d case , this is @xmath86 , or one out of 2.3 @xmath87 stars",
    ". given that in total 2.9 @xmath77 stars are in the volume of influence in each orbit , this implies a capture rate of one dozen stars per orbit - body simulations , which is beyond the scope of this paper . ] .",
    "for a keplerian orbit at 3 kpc , one revolution lasts about 2.5@xmath88 years . in a hubble time",
    ", one can therefore capture about 6000 stars .",
    "this is 1.5% of the total assumed gc luminosity , not sufficient to fully explain the observed effects .",
    "only when considering a more extreme orbital distance of 1 kpc does the total number of captured stars increase to about 4@xmath87 , i.e. @xmath8910% of all stars .",
    "we now briefly examine the opposite effect of field star capture : namely cluster star evaporation .",
    "as is well known , mass segregation in gcs ( gunn & griffin 1979 ; jordn  2004 ) will result in evaporation affecting mainly the lowest mass stars .",
    "lamers et al .",
    "@xcite find for clusters of solar metallicity that evaporation will cause the overall gc color to become bluer with time ( over most of their lifetime ) due to the preferential loss of red , low - mass stars .",
    "could such a color change help to explain our observations ?",
    "two effects are important : ( 1 ) the _ maximum _ blueward shift due to evaporation is larger for more massive clusters ( lamers et al .",
    "@xcite ) , reaching up to @xmath90 0.10  mag ; and ( 2 ) the dissolution time , @xmath91 , is longer for more massive clusters . to qualitatively explain our observations one would require the massive gcs to be in an early stage of evolution , so that evaporation has not yet had a significant effect",
    "the fainter gcs would mainly define the color magnitude trend .",
    "however , figure  [ colorhist ] shows that the slope changes between inner and outer gcs are mainly driven by the _",
    "brightest _ gcs .",
    "that is , evaporation is unlikely to account fully for the observed color - magnitude trend .",
    "even more serious , evaporation can not naturally explain the simultaneous presence of a trend for the blue gcs and its absence for the red",
    ".      generally speaking , self enrichment will occur in any stellar system , gcs included , if the system is able to retain a fraction of the gas expelled by the first generation of supernovae and subsequently form a new generation of stars . to create a metallicity - mass ( or , equivalently , a color - magnitude ) trend via self - enrichment , one would therefore require that more massive gcs are more efficiently self - enriched . the extent to which gcs in the milky way may have self - enriched",
    ", however , is a controversial subject : e.g. , frank & gisler  @xcite , smith  @xcite , gnedin  @xcite , parmentier & gilmore  @xcite , dopita & smith  @xcite , morgan & lake  @xcite , thoul  @xcite .    in this context , it is interesting to note that the most massive gc in the galaxy , @xmath92  cen , is known to have a metallicity distribution function that shows a long tail towards high metallicities ( e.g. , norris , freeman & mighell  1996 ; stanford _",
    "various studies have found this high - metallicity population to be either coeval , or perhaps 24 gyr younger , than the cluster s primary ( metal - poor ) population ( e.g. , ferraro  2004 ; sollima et al .",
    "2005 ; hughes & wallenstein  2000 ; hilker & richtler  2000 ; rey  2004 , stanford  2006 ) .",
    "this is consistent with @xmath92  cen having been at least partially self - enriched .",
    "note , however , that because of its peculiar star formation history , numerous investigators have suggested that the cluster may be the stripped nucleus of a now - dissolved dwarf galaxy ( e.g. , freeman  1993 ; hilker & richtler  2000 ; bekki & freeman  2003 ) .",
    "if true , then it may be incorrect to consider @xmath92  cen to be a typical example of a self enriched gc .",
    "this caveat aside , if self enrichment is common to the formation of the most massive gcs , then it may indeed help to explain our observations .",
    "most significantly , the lack of a correlation among the red gc subpopulation is naturally explained in this scenario : i.e. , the redder gcs are already metal - enriched , and a fixed amount _ d_z of supernovae ejecta will cause a relatively weaker metallicity increase , _",
    "d_[fe / h ] , for metal - rich gcs .",
    "for instance , for a system with [ fe / h ] = @xmath932 ( z = 0.0002 ) , adding a fixed amount of metals _",
    "d_z = 0.0002 will result in _ d_[fe / h]=@xmath940.3 dex . according to peng  @xcite this corresponds to a shift in @xmath2 of about 0.06 mag and is about the observed amount of the color magnitude trend .",
    "however , for a system with [ fe / h ] = @xmath930.5 and the same _ d_z , we only have _ d_[fe / h]=@xmath940.013 dex , with a corresponding color change in @xmath2 well below 0.01 mag .",
    "a possible shortcoming of this self - enrichment scenario is that is does not explicitly account for environmental effects such as a dependence on galactocentric radius . on the other hand , feedback induced by pressure - confinement from the surrounding medium may be able to help reconcile this scenario with observations .      to conclude this discussion ,",
    "we show in figure  [ met ] a metallicity - luminosity plot for the co - added sample of gcs in group 1 . to estimate gc metallicities , we have applied a quartic color - metallicity transformation based on the empirical calibration data from peng  @xcite .",
    "note that the resulting metallicity distribution is _ not _ bimodal , but rather shows a single pronounced peak at [ fe / h]@xmath89 @xmath930.4  dex and a long , extended tail towards lower metallicities .",
    "this confirms recent warnings ( e.g. , richtler  2005 ; yoon , yi & lee  2006 ) that bimodality in color does not necessarily imply bimodality in metallicity .",
    "using the data in figure  [ met ] , we can compare the metallicity distributions of gcs brighter and fainter than @xmath95 mag .",
    "for the metal - poor population , ( [ fe / h]@xmath96 - 0.6 ) , the fainter gcs have a significantly broader tail towards lower metallicities than do the bright ones .",
    "a ks - test gives a 0.1% probability for a common underlying distribution between both samples . in the metal - rich part of the diagram ,",
    "the agreement is very good , with a ks probability of 91% . in other words ,",
    "the empirical finding of a color - magnitude trend for the blue gcs can hence be re - phrased in terms of metallicity : the gc systems appear to have a skewed , but unimodal , metallicity distribution function whose metal - poor tail becomes increasingly extended at lower luminosities / masses .",
    "in this paper we have analysed the color - magnitude relation for the gc subpopulations in early - type galaxies belonging to the virgo cluster .",
    "our sample consists of 79 galaxies , spanning the range @xmath0  mag , drawn from the acs virgo cluster survey ( ct 2004 ) .",
    "our principal findings can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "based on fits , we find a highly significant correlation @xmath1 for the blue gcs in the co - added cmd of the three brightest virgo cluster galaxies ( m49 , m87 , m60 ) .",
    "the sense of the correlation is such that brightest gcs in this subpopulation are redder than their faint counterparts . for m87 and m60 alone",
    ", we find comparable correlations ; by contrast , the blue gcs in m49 do not appear to follow such a trend . in no galaxy",
    "do we find a significant correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 for the gcs associated with the red subpopulation .",
    "2 .   based on fits ,",
    "we find the slope @xmath97 within the blue subpopulation to be much weaker than @xmath5 . in turn",
    ", we find a mild _ positive _ correlation @xmath45 for the red subpopulation , in the opposite sense to what is found for the blue subpopulation .",
    "3 .   we test on artificial cmds with , and without , implemented slopes for the blue subpopulation , and no slope for the red population .",
    "correctly reproduces the implemented slopes when using the cmd @xmath2 vs. @xmath3 . for @xmath2 vs. @xmath6 , gives a biased estimate for the color of the blue population and yields a positive slope for the red subpopulation , although no slope had been implemented .",
    "we trace this bias to the fact that in @xmath6  unlike in @xmath3  the luminosity function of blue gcs is populated to significantly brighter luminosities than for the red gcs .",
    "we conclude that for the real data , the strong slope @xmath5 is _ not _ an artifact of the fitting method , while the weaker slope @xmath45 is an artificial feature of the fit .",
    "we derive correlations independent of by using a biweight estimator for gcs divided on the basis of a luminosity independent color .",
    "the results confirm the significant slope found by in @xmath3 and reveal no significant discrepancies between the slope measured using @xmath3 and @xmath6 .",
    "5 .   the slope measured from the blue subpopulation decreases with host galaxy luminosity . however , even among the faintest galaxies ( @xmath30  mag ) the slope is nonzero .",
    "the color - magnitude relation exhibited by the blue gcs is stronger for clusters with smaller projected galactocentric distances .",
    "this difference is driven mainly by gcs with @xmath61 mag .",
    "we examine a number of physical mechanisms that might give rise to a color - magnitude relation with these characteristics : ( 1 ) contamination by super - star - clusters , stripped galactic nuclei , or ultra - compact dwarf galaxies ; ( 2 ) accretion of gcs from low - mass galaxies ; ( 3 ) stochastic effects ; ( 4 ) capture of galactic field stars by gcs ; and ( 5 ) self - enrichment of individual gcs .",
    "neither contaminants nor accretion of low - mass galaxies appear likely to fully explain our observations .",
    "self - enrichment in more massive gcs may be able to account for the observed color - magnitude relation , although more work is needed to determine if the dependence on galactocentric radius can be explained within the context of the self - enrichment scenario .",
    "although the capture of field stars _ does _ lead to a dependence on galactocentric radius that is at least qualitatively in agreement with our observations , this mechanism does not appear efficient enough to explain the overall size of the observed trend .    while none of these scenarios can fully account for the full set of observations in a straightforward manner , self - enrichment and capture of field stars seem the most promising approaches .",
    "there is , of course , no _ a priori _ reason that a single mechanism is responsible for the observed color - magnitude relation , and conceptually , the combined effects of self - enrichment and field star capture may be able to explain the observations : i.e. , field star capture could act as a second order effect , producing environmental variations of a global mass - metallicity relation induced by self - enrichment .",
    "this would alleviate the discrepancy between real and required field star capture rate estimated in this work . dedicated n - body simulations going beyond these simple estimates",
    "will be required to accurately address the efficiency of field star capture in different environments .",

    "<S> we examine the correlation between globular cluster ( gc ) color and magnitude using hst / acs imaging for a sample of 79 early - type galaxies ( @xmath0 mag ) with accurate surface - brightness fluctuation distances from the acs virgo cluster survey . using the mixture modeling algorithm , we find a highly significant correlation , @xmath1 , between color and magnitude for the subpopulation of blue gcs in the co - added gc color - magnitude diagram of the three brightest virgo cluster galaxies ( m49 , m87 and m60 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sense of the correlation is such that brighter gcs are redder than their fainter counterparts . for the single gc systems of m87 and m60 , we find similar correlations ; m49 does not appear to show a significant trend . </S>",
    "<S> there is no correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 for gcs belonging to the red subpopulation . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation @xmath4 for the blue subpopulation is much weaker than @xmath5 . using monte carlo simulations </S>",
    "<S> , we attribute this finding to the fact that the blue subpopulation in @xmath6 extends to higher luminosities than does the red subpopulation , which biases the fit results . </S>",
    "<S> the highly significant correlation between color and @xmath3 , however , is a real effect : this conclusion is supported by biweight fits to the same color distributions . </S>",
    "<S> we identify two environmental dependencies which influence the derived color - magnitude relation : ( 1 ) the slope of the color - magnitude relation decreases in significance with decreasing galaxy luminosity , although it remains detectable over the full luminosity range of our sample ; and ( 2 ) the slope is stronger for gc populations located at smaller galactocentric distances . </S>",
    "<S> these characteristics suggest that the observed trend is , at least partially , shaped by external agents . </S>",
    "<S> we examine several physical mechanisms that might give rise to the observed color - magnitude relation including : ( 1 ) presence of contaminants like super - clusters , stripped galactic nuclei , or ultra - compact dwarfs ; ( 2 ) accretion of gcs from low - mass galaxies ; ( 3 ) stochastic effects ; ( 4 ) the capture of field stars by individual gcs ; and ( 5 ) gc self - enrichment . </S>",
    "<S> although none of these scenarios offers a fully satisfactory explanation of the observations , we conclude that self - enrichment and field - star capture , or a combination of these processes , offer the most promising means of explaining our observations . </S>"
