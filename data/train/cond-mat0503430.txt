    "although emission of clusters of atoms during ion sputtering was first observed almost half a century ago @xcite , this phenomenon has attracted more attention in recent years , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "recent reviews on this topic are available in the literature .",
    "@xcite various scenarios for cluster emission have been projected ; these range from linear - cascade sputtering over surface evaporation to gasification ( or volume evaporation ) .",
    "@xcite    for cluster emission , it has been shown @xcite that the size distribution , @xmath7 , of the emitted clusters obey an inverse power - law :    @xmath8    where @xmath4 is the number of atoms in a given cluster . for small emitted clusters ( @xmath4 @xmath9 40 ) the reported values of @xmath10 range between 4 and 8 .",
    "@xcite for larger clusters ( @xmath4 @xmath5 500 ) recently rehn _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported a value of @xmath10 = 2 , which is consistent with the model of bitensky and parilis .",
    "@xcite this value of @xmath10 = 2 is consistent with the mechanism that large clusters are produced when shock waves , generated by subsurface displacement cascades , ablate the surface .",
    "however , these results are for sputtering either from solid surfaces or from continuous films . for nanodispersed films one may expect different results as the sputtering phenomenon",
    "can be expected to be considerably stronger in small finite systems as nanometer sized islands .",
    "kissel and urbassek investigated sputtering from clusters by molecular - dynamics ( md ) computer simulation where they modeled the materials effects occurring in a highly energized nonequilibrium cascade volume ( i.e. the effect of energy spike ) .",
    "@xcite in this simulation they used 100 kev au atom bombardment of spherical au clusters ( of 4 nm radius ) .",
    "their results show a distribution of emitted clusters containing up to 100 atoms and even beyond .",
    "smaller clusters ( up to @xmath1110 ) show an inverse power - law [ eq .",
    "[ power - law ] ] with @xmath10 = 2.3 . for larger cluster sizes",
    ", the decay appears to become even softer .",
    "this fall - off is distinctly slower than that observed for kev - ion bombardment of metal surfaces .",
    "@xcite this means that larger clusters are emitted with a higher probability from cluster targets compared to targets with planar solid surfaces . for the larger sizes ( @xmath4 @xmath12 10 ) of emitted clusters , the value of @xmath10 was not extracted from the simulation results .    to our knowledge ,",
    "no experimental results of size distribution of emitted particles in ion bombardment of free clusters are available .",
    "however , ion bombardment of clusters deposited on surfaces has recently been investigated experimentally .",
    "@xcite , although no effort was made to verify the power - law dependence of @xmath7 and extract the value of the exponent . in this paper we present an effort to verify the power - law dependence of the large ( @xmath13 1,000 ) emitted particles from nanodispersed au on silicon substrates due to mev au ion bombardment .    in earlier experiments , where particle ejection from ion - bombarded nanoisland films was investigated , cluster ion beams instead of a monomer ion beam was used .",
    "@xcite the interaction of a cluster ion beam with solids may be quite different ( nonlinear ) in comparison to a monomer beam ; this happens due to vicinage of atoms in the cluster beam .",
    "@xcite thus the interaction of a cluster ion beam with nanoisland targets can in principle , produce a different distribution of ejected particles compared to the interaction of a monomer ion beam . here",
    "we consider the simpler case of irradiation with a monomer ion beam .",
    "our present study is concerned with the interaction of 1.5 mev au@xmath0 ( monomer ) ions with au nanoisland films .",
    "our earlier studies have shown that when nanodispersed targets are bombarded by 1.5 mev au ions , the size and coverage of sputtered particles collected on a catcher grid are larger compared to thicker continuous film targets .",
    "@xcite we observed also higher probability of crater formation in island thin films compared to thick continuous films due to mev self - ion irradiation and proposed it as experimental evidence of the energy spike confinement in nanoisland targets .",
    "@xcite an energy spike confinement in the nanoislands can result in either a thermal spike or a shock wave spatial confinement .",
    "au films of thickness 1.3 @xmath14 0.1 nm were deposited by thermal evaporation under high - vacuum conditions ( @xmath15 mbar ) on native - oxide covered si(100 ) substrates at room temperature ( rt ) .",
    "deposition rate was 0.1 nm / s . before thin film deposition , substrates were ultrasonically cleaned in acetone , methanol , trichloroethylene , methanol , deionized water and in acetone sequentially .",
    "ion sputtering experiments were performed with 1.5 mev au@xmath0 ions with fluences ranging from @xmath16 to @xmath17 ions @xmath2 at different angles of incidence with respect to the surface normal .",
    "the incident ion current ( over a scanned beam area of 1@xmath181 @xmath19 ) was kept between 20 to 40 na under secondary electron suppressed geometry . during irradiation ,",
    "the sputtered particles were collected on a catcher grid that was positioned @xmath201 cm above the target , the catcher surface making an angle ( @xmath21 ) with respect to the sample surface .",
    "such a large distance of the catcher is to reduce overlap of the collected particles on the catcher grid . during irradiation ,",
    "@xmath22 2@xmath1810@xmath23 mbar pressure was maintained in the irradiation chamber .",
    "transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) measurements were performed ( using a jeol jem-2010 ( uhr ) electron microscope operating at 200 kv ) on the ion - bombarded samples to study the changes in the morphology of the nanostructures on the substrates and to determine the surface coverage and the size distribution of the sputtered particles on the catcher grids .",
    "the effective thickness of the as - deposited au films on si substrates has been determined by rutherford backscattering spectrometry ( rbs ) using the bulk atomic density of au and the rump simulation package .",
    "the deposited au grows as islands on native - oxide covered si substrate .",
    "1 shows a plan - view tem micrograph of such a sample and a histogram for the particle size distribution .",
    "the distribution is fitted well by a gaussian function .",
    "it is found that the au islands are isolated with an average particle size of 11.1 @xmath14 0.1 nm with a standard deviation , @xmath24 = 5.1 @xmath14 0.3 nm and the surface coverage of islands is @xmath626% .",
    "these values are obtained using several tem micrographs and the imagej analysis package .",

    "it appears from the micrographs that in the initial stage of irradiation , particles get agglomerated and elongated . for an ion fluence of @xmath16 ions @xmath2 , surface coverage of islands increases from 26% to 34% and",

    "compared to 30@xmath26-impact angle , here the surface coverage of au particles on the target reduces more rapidly with ion fluence .",
    "the embedding also begins to occur at a smaller fluence for the 60@xmath26-impact angle of the ion beam .",
    "it appears that embedding has already begun at a fluence of @xmath27 ions @xmath2 .",

    "5(d ) , which is not embedded .",
    "it is also evident that at lower fluences when the particle size is small , there is no embedding .",

    "for the lowest ion fluence ( @xmath16 ions @xmath2 ) , the density of islands on the catcher grid [ figs .",
    "3(e ) and 4(d ) ] is low and the island size distribution , although fitted by a log - normal function , actually does not deviate much from a gaussian function . for higher ion fluences ,",
    "apparently there is ejection of more larger sized particles [ cf .",
    "for example , figs .",
    "3(f ) , ( j ) and 4(e ) , ( h ) ] . this appears to be correlated with the increase of particle size on the target [ cf .",

    "this correlation has earlier been observed by baranov _",
    "@xcite , who performed experiments on nanodispersed targets with selected particle sizes .",
    "thus , for ion bombardment at higher fluences the size distributions develop a tail extending into larger sizes and a log - normal function fits the distribution better .    in order to understand the mechanism involved in the ejection of particles in ion - target interaction ,",
    "many authors have predicted different power - laws . according to eq .",
    "[ power - law ] , the size distribution , @xmath7 , of the sputtered particles obeys an inverse power - law . @xcite the value of the exponent @xmath10 , in eq .",
    "[ power - law ] depends on the mechanism of ion - target interaction .",
    "experimental determination of the value of @xmath10 exists in the literature only for solid surfaces and continuous film targets .",
    "there are conflicting results in the literature .",
    "the exponent , @xmath10 , was found to correlate @xcite with the total sputtering yield , such that higher sputtering yields result in smaller values of @xmath10 .",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported that the value of @xmath10 is independent of sputtering yield . using mass - spectrometry techniques , the observed values of @xmath10 range between 4 and 8 .",
    "@xcite however , these values are for smaller ejected clusters of @xmath37 40 atoms .",
    "a high exponent means that smaller clusters are present with high probabilities in the mass - spectrometry studies .",
    "it is suspected that some large clusters get fragmented to increase the number of small clusters .",
    "_ @xcite restricted their studies to large clusters ( @xmath13 500 ) and obtained a value of @xmath10 = 2 .",
    "consistent with a theoretical model this value of the exponent indicates that the large clusters are produced when shock waves , generated by subsurface displacement cascades , ablate the surface .",
    "the shock wave model proposed by bitensky and parilis @xcite predicts the inverse - square dependence of @xmath7 . on the other hand",
    "no simple theoretical model has been able to reproduce both the power - law and high values of @xmath10 found from mass - spectrometry techniques .",
    "all these results discussed in this paragraph are for solid surfaces and continuous thin film targets .    for cluster targets md simulation of kissel and urbassek",
    "@xcite predicts a value of @xmath10 @xmath38 2.3 for small clusters ( @xmath37 10 ) . for larger clusters ( @xmath39 10 )",
    "the decay appears to become softer , although they have not tried to extract the value of @xmath10 from this region . to our knowledge , this is the only theoretical work where cluster ejection in an ion - cluster interaction has been considered .",
    "we try to compare our results with these simulation results .",
    "we have fitted the larger cluster region ( @xmath39 10 ) of the spectrum from ref .",
    "10 and obtained a value of @xmath40 1.15 .",
    "the plot of data with the fit is shown in fig .",
    "now we present our results of size distributions of the larger clusters ( @xmath13 1,000 ) in terms of the inverse power - law dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath4 .",
    "the particle size distribution , @xmath7 , i.e. the number of clusters containing @xmath4 atoms , was determined from the catcher grid as follows .",
    "the size of each particle was determined using imagej software .",
    "the measured lateral dimensions were converted into the number of atoms for a given cluster by assuming that the particles are spherical with the density of bulk au .",
    "all visible particles in an area of @xmath41 nm@xmath42 ( ten frames , each of @xmath6 210 @xmath18 160 nm@xmath42 ) were sized .",
    "the particles were grouped into bins having 1 nm steps .",
    "the procedure was repeated for each case of irradiation .",
    "the size distributions that were obtained in this manner are displayed in fig .",
    "7 alongwith a power - law fit .",
    "the values of the exponent @xmath10 , although show some variations , broadly are close to that of the theoretical value shown in fig .",
    "nevertheless , one notices that for the lowest fluence ( @xmath16 ions @xmath2 ) where the size distributions of the emitted particles [ fig .",
    "3(i ) and 4(g ) ] are nearly gaussian and the presence of larger size particles is not prominent , the value of the exponent @xmath10 is larger .",
    "one may also note that the particle sizes on the target in these cases are also smaller .",
    "studies of ejected particle distribution from nanoisland targets must be explored further both theoretically and experimentally . in the simulation of kissel and urbassek @xcite ,",
    "electronic stopping of the ions in the target island has been disregarded .",
    "the electronic energy loss ( @xmath43 ) and the nuclear energy loss ( @xmath44 ) for 1.5 mev au ions in a au target are 2.41 kev / nm and 9.53 kev / nm respectively , as obtained by using the srim 2003 code .",
    "@xcite it is important to note that , since @xmath44 is @xmath22 3.9 @xmath43 , although the effect of @xmath44 will be dominant , contributions to sputtering from both mechanisms could be possible .",
    "some md simulations show a dependence of sputtering yield on @xmath43 .",
    "@xcite it is to be investigated how the inclusion of the effects of both @xmath44 and @xmath43 affect the value of @xmath10 .    in order to explain the nature of the observed size distributions ( fig .",
    "7 ) , i.e. , @xmath7 rising at the beginning , following inverse power - law at the middle and then falling faster at the end .",
    "we refer to the work of baranov _",
    "et al._. @xcite they have reported sputtering of nanodispersed targets and shown that the size distributions of ejected clusters are systematically shifted towards smaller sizes in comparison with the island size distributions on the targets .",
    "for example average island sizes of 4.5@xmath141.2 nm and 6.7@xmath142.5 nm on the target led to average island sizes of 3.6@xmath141.1 nm and 4.4@xmath141.6 nm , respectively , of the ejected particles .",
    "so , experimentally the general trend is that smaller particles on the target produces smaller ejected particles and the larger particles on the target produces larger ejected particles .",
    "the simulation of kissel and urbassek @xcite shows that for a target particle of a given size , a size distribution of ejected particles is generated . combining these two results ( experimental and theoretical ) one would expect that when the target particle is larger a distribution of particles with the same exponent but shifted to a larger average size would be generated . using this concept",
    "we can explain the nature of our observed @xmath7 versus @xmath4 curves .",
    "we have illustrated this in fig .",
    "we have generated several plots with the same exponent and then shifted the curves along the @xmath4-axis to mimic contributions from particles of different sizes , d ( d@xmath45 @xmath46 d@xmath47 @xmath46 d@xmath48 @xmath46 d@xmath49 @xmath46 d@xmath50 ) , representing the diameter of the particle on the target .",
    "then we added all the sets of data . the resultant curve ( solid curve )",
    "shows the same nature as our experimental curves .",
    "this explains why with increasing @xmath4 experimental data show the rising nature of @xmath7 at the beginning , power - law fall in the middle and a faster fall at the end .",
    "this behavior is prominently seen in fig .",
    "7(a ) [ @xmath29 ions @xmath2 ] and in fig .",
    "7(b ) [ @xmath27 ions @xmath2 ] . kissel and uebassek have done the simulation only for a single size particle ( 4 nm radius ) .",
    "it would be useful to have simulation results for different sizes of target islands .",
    "we have investigated the distribution of ejected ( sputtered ) particles from nanoislands in monomer ion interaction with nanodispersed solid targets . the ejected cluster size distribution",
    "as a function of number of atomsper ejected particle shows a power - law decay , @xmath52 , with @xmath53 .",
    "the exponent is in broad agreement with a molecular dynamics simulation where the effect of an energy spike in the target islands is considered . in the simulation ,",
    "as neither serious effort has been made to extract the exponent for larger ejected islands nor the size dependence of target islands has been considered , more theoretical input is required to understand the distribution of sputtered particles and the mechanism of sputtering .",
