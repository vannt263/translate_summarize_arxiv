    "it is well - known that carrier scattering by background quenched disorder arising from random impurities and defects limits the @xmath13 ( i.e. , low - temperature ) residual conductivity of a metal or doped semiconductor .",
    "this `` residual resistivity '' , i.e. , the extrapolated @xmath13 value of the electrical resistivity obtained from the measured low - temperature transport data , provides information about the extrinsic disorder in the material limiting transport properties . in 3d metals ,",
    "this residual resistivity is not of much intrinsic fundamental interest except for the fact that very pure defect - free single crystals , where the background disorder is presumably very low , could have extremely low residual resistivity leading to very long electron mean free paths . in particular , the residual resistivity of different samples ( with different levels of sample purity , i.e. , different impurity or defect content ) of the same metal could differ by orders of magnitude , and a metallic resistivity uniquely defining a particular metal ( e.g. cu , al , or ag ) is only meaningful at higher temperatures ( @xmath14 k ) where phonon scattering dominates the electrical resistivity over impurity / defect / disorder scattering . at low temperatures ,",
    "each metallic sample would have a unique resistivity reflecting its specific impurity content signature , and as such characterizing a metal by a unique resistivity is useless at low temperatures ( i.e. , each sample of the same metal would have different resistivity at @xmath13 ) .",
    "in fact , the low - temperature resistivity of a particular sample typically depends on the preparation history of the sample , and annealing to room temperatures ( where all samples of a particular metal do have the same resistivity ) and then cooling down to low temperatures could substantially modify the sample resistivity as the impurity / disorder configuration could change due to annealing .",
    "theoretical statements @xcite about residual resistivity ( or equivalently , low temperature resistivity ) of 3d metals thus focus on first principles calculations of the quantitative aspects of the local disorder potential arising from various defects or disorder in the metal ( where the specific types of defect or impurity have to be specifically assumed ) , and then estimating the resistivity arising from various postulated disorder in terms of resistivity due to some specified impurity or defect content on an atomic percentage basis .",
    "typical values of calculated residual resistivity for most simple metals fall in the @xmath15 @xmath16 cm range per atomic percentage of impurities , and thus a metal with 99.999% ( e.g. , cu ) purity could have an extremely low residual resistivity of @xmath17 @xmath18 cm , leading to elastic mean free paths @xmath19 cm although the typical phonon - limited room - temperature mean free paths in most metals are only @xmath20  with the room - temperature phonon - limited resistivity of most metals being around @xmath21 cm .    thus , theoretical studies @xcite of disorder - limited residual resistivity of metals focus entirely on the quantitative modeling of various defect scattering in the metal using detailed materials - specific band structure and boltzmann transport theories .",
    "no systematic dependence of the residual resistivity of metals on various metallicity parameters ( e.g. , the wigner - seitz radius @xmath22 or lattice constant or fermi energy ) can in general be discussed qualitatively , and there is no metallic density scaling of conductivity that one can speak of since the carrier density can not be tuned by an external gate voltage in metals ( as it can be in 2d semiconductor systems or in graphene ) . in principle , there is only a modest variation in @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) among different 3d metals ( since @xmath24 where @xmath2 is the effective metallic free electron density ) , but the band structure variation in going from a metal to another would typically swamp any systematic @xmath22-dependence of the residual resistivity .",
    "thus , the only systematic trend of the residual resistivity in metals which is discussed in the literature @xcite is the dependence of the @xmath13 impurity - limited resistivity of a particular metal on the atomic type ( e.g. atomic number ) of the various impurities or on the type of defects causing the resistive scattering .",
    "it is basically a subject of quantitative details based on serious numerical calculations .    in the current work",
    "we are interested in discussing qualitatively the impurity - limited ` metallic ' residual ( i.e. @xmath13 ) resistivity as a function of the electron density of the metal . in particular",
    ", we want to understand the density - dependence of the @xmath13 metallic resistivity assuming that the metallic density can be tuned continuously keeping all other parameters ( e.g. , disorder , band structure ) fixed .",
    "of course , such a situation is practically impossible in 3d metals since the electron density is fixed in each metal and can not be tuned at all .",
    "but , as is well - known , such a tunable carrier density situation is routine in 2d `` metallic '' systems such as si mosfets , gated semiconductor heterostructures and quantum wells , and gated graphene . in principle",
    ", a variable carrier density can be achieved in 3d doped semiconductor systems by changing the doping level ( but keeping the same dopant element ) in different samples , but this is not ideal for our purpose of a qualitative understanding of the density scaling of the metallic @xmath13 saturated resistivity since there is always the possibility of unknown sample to sample variation beyond just the carrier density variation since doping level can not be tuned continuously in a single sample as can be done in 2d systems .",
    "we do , however , briefly consider the density scaling properties of 3d impurity - limited saturated resistivity for the sake of completeness although most of the current work focuses on 2d semiconductor structures ( and graphene ) where the carrier density can be easily tuned in the same sample by applying an external gate voltage , and thus the density - dependent conductivity is a meaningful concept in 2d `` effective metallic '' systems existing in semiconductor structures and graphene .",
    "obviously , the @xmath13 conductivity ( @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is resistivity ) would manifest different density dependence for different types of background disorder , i.e. , different types of impurity - electron interaction .",
    "the main resistive disorder scattering in relatively pure 3d metals is due to defects , vacancies , and impurities which scatter primarily through the short - range ( essentially ) @xmath27-function type scattering potential ( although there are extended defects which could produce anisotropic longer - range disorder potential ) . disorder scattering by @xmath27-function type point scatterers gives rise to rather uninteresting density scaling of electrical conductivity , again making 3d metals unsuitable for studying the density dependence of conductivity .",
    "our main interest in this work is to obtain the density scaling of 2d @xmath13 `` metallic '' conductivity arising from coulomb disorder induced by random quenched charged impurity centers in the environment .",
    "quenched coulomb disorder is the dominant extrinsic resistive scattering mechanism in all semiconductor systems ( 2d or 3d ) at low temperatures since doping by impurities is essential in inducing carriers in a semiconductor ( whereas metals , by definition , have free carriers at the fermi level even at @xmath13 ) , leading to the inevitable existence of background coulomb disorder .",
    "thus , a key distinction between low - temperature transport in metals and semiconductors is that short - range disorder ( arising from very strong metallic screening ) dominates metallic transport whereas long - range coulombic disorder ( arising from random localized charged impurities ) dominates transport in ( both 2d and 3d ) doped semiconductors .",
    "the density dependent conductivity in doped semiconductor structures ( or graphene ) arises from the carrier screening of background coulombic disorder which depends sensitively on the dimensionless ratio @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are respectively the ( density dependent ) screening wave vector and fermi wave vector of the system .",
    "the variation in the carrier screening properties as a function of the carrier density eventually leads to the density dependence of the resistivity .",
    "of course in doped semiconductors , one must worry about the additional complications of disorder - induced anderson localization and/or low - temperature carrier freezeout and/or possible percolation transition associated with charged impurity - induced charge puddle formation . in the current work ,",
    "we ignore all of these complications uncritically , focusing primarily on extremely high - quality modulation - doped 2d gaas quantum well structures ( and high - quality suspended graphene ) where these complicating circumstances are absent down to very low carrier densities and very low temperatures .",
    "our theoretical results presented in this paper , based on drude - boltzmann semiclassical transport theory , should apply to experimental systems above carrier densities ( and temperatures ) where localization ( and related effects ) become operational .",
    "the neglect of carrier localization and freezeout is not a particularly significant issue for our 2d theory and results because high - quality 2d semiconductor systems ( and graphene ) are not susceptible to these problems except perhaps at extremely low temperatures and carrier densities of little practical or experimental interest . on the other hand ,",
    "our low - temperature and low - density transport results for 3d doped semiconductors are given here purely for the purpose of completeness and comparison with 2d results since 3d doped semiconductors typically become insulating at low carrier density ( as well as low temperature ) because of localization and carrier freezeout .",
    "our focus and most of our presented results , as the title of our article clearly indicates , are on low - temperature density dependent metallic transport properties of very high - quality 2d systems where the concept of density scaling of conductivity is both theoretically and experimentally meaningful .",
    "one may wonder about the fact that the scaling theory of localization predicts that all 2d systems are strictly speaking anderson insulators , and have , in principle , zero conductivity at @xmath13 for infinite samples at all carrier densities .",
    "( this is theoretically true even for graphene when disorder induced intervalley carrier scattering is taken into account . ) for our purpose in the current work , where we are specifically interested in very high - mobility 2d structures with very low background disorder , the scaling localization is a non - issue because ( 1 ) the samples are finite in size and the temperature , although low , is still finite ; and ( 2 ) more importantly , the elastic mean free path is extremely long , making the effective 2d localization length much larger than the system size ( or the phase breaking length , whichever is shorter ) .",
    "thus , we are specifically considering the density dependence of the semiclassical part of the 2d resistivity in the situation where the semiclassical resistivity is much larger than the quantum ( or weak localization ) contribution to the resistivity .",
    "this limit is generic in high mobility 2d gaas semiconductor systems and in graphene , and therefore our work is of wide validity .",
    "thus we are strictly speaking considering the density dependence of the zeroth order semiclassical conductivity in the situation where the quantum contribution to the resistivity is negligible .",
    "we emphasize that the density dependence ( or scaling ) of electrical transport properties is rarely discussed in the theoretical literature mainly because ( as discussed above ) such a density dependence of electrical conductivity is neither relevant nor interesting in 3d metals . indeed",
    ", it is universally believed that the only aspect of electrical conductivity where studying the carrier density dependence is a meaningful endeavor is in the study of density - tuned anderson localization as a ( @xmath13 ) quantum phase transition , exactly the physical phenomenon we are excluding in the current work where we focus entirely on the drude - boltzmann part of the conductivity in high quality samples assuming quantum localization effects to be negligible .",
    "thus , the density scaling of our theory is not connected with quantum criticality at all , but with the behavior of the density dependence of the background disorder arising from nontrivial screening properties .",
    "in contrast to the density dependence which is rarely discussed in the literature except in the context of metal - insulator transition , the temperature dependence of transport properties has been extensively discussed for electronic materials ( including many experimental and theoretical papers in 2d systems @xcite ) because the temperature dependent electrical resistivity generically contains qualitative information about the underlying resistive scattering mechanism .",
    "for example , a linear - in - t higher temperature metallic resistivity is the hallmark of acoustic phonon scattering in both metals and semiconductors ( and in both 2d or 3d systems ) whereas acoustic phonons typically lead to strongly suppressed high power laws ( @xmath31 with @xmath32 depending on the details ) in the ( 2d or 3d ) metallic resistivity below a system - dependent bloch - grneisen temperature @xmath33 . our current work focuses entirely on temperatures well below the bloch - grneisen temperature ( @xmath34 ) so that phonons are completely ineffective in limiting the electrical conductivity .",
    "optical phonons , which are often relevant in semiconductor transport at higher temperatures and indeed limit the room - temperature resistivity of 2d gaas - based semiconductor structures @xcite and are exponentially suppressed as @xmath35 at low temperatures ( where @xmath36 k in gaas ) , are completely irrelevant for our low - temperature transport considerations .",
    "it is well - known that high - quality low - density 2d semiconductor systems ( as well as graphene ) often manifest a strong temperature dependence in its low - temperature resistivity @xcite , which arises from the strong temperature dependence of the screened coulomb disorder @xcite at low carrier densities .",
    "again , our theoretical work at @xmath13 is completely free from any temperature - induced complications in the resistivity since our interest is in understanding the density dependence of the @xmath13 resistivity / conductivity , which can be obtained from the low - temperature experimental data by extrapolation to @xmath13 or by sitting always at a constant very low temperature ( e.g. , 50 mk ) in obtaining the density dependence of the transport properties . in any case , the question we are interested in is perfectly well - defined as a matter of principle : how does the @xmath13 drude - boltzmann semiclassical conductivity of a 2d ( or 3d ) `` metallic '' system vary as a function of its carrier density in the presence of background screened coulomb disorder being the main resistive scattering mechanism ?    in the rest of this article , we provide a detailed theoretical answer to the question posed in the last sentence above .",
    "the @xmath13 conductivity @xmath0 of a 2d metallic system is typically written as @xcite @xmath37 in the boltzmann theory , where @xmath38 , @xmath39 are respectively the fermi energy and the fermi velocity , @xmath40 is the carrier density of states at the fermi surface , and @xmath41 is the so - called relaxation time ( or the scattering time ) for the relevant resistive scattering mechanism .",
    "( the factor 2 in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq1 ] ) is replaced by 3 for 3d systems . )",
    "it is assumed that @xmath39 , @xmath38 , and @xmath42 are known as a function of the carrier density @xmath2 from the relevant band structure information ( and we will consider only the parabolic and the linear band approximation with the linear approximation used for obtaining our graphene transport results ) .",
    "the whole theory then boils down to a calculation of the transport relaxation time @xmath41 at the fermi surface using the appropriate microscopic scattering mechanism ( which we describe in details in section iii of our paper ) .    for parabolic bands with @xmath43 we can write @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the carrier effective mass , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq1 ] ) simply reduces to the celebrated drude - boltzmann transport formula : @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath2 is the relevant ( 2d or 3d ) carrier density . for graphene ,",
    "( [ eq : eq2 ] ) requires a slight modification @xcite which we will discuss later when we come to describing our graphene results . from this point on ,",
    "unless otherwise stated , our explicit equations and formula are given for parabolic band 2d systems  we will consider the very special linear band case of graphene separately at the appropriate juncture .",
    "most of our results focus on 2d semiconductor systems , specifically 2d gaas electron or hole quantum wells where the parabolic approximation applies well .",
    "we will point out the corresponding 3d parabolic band analytic results as appropriate , concentrating on presenting the equations and formulas mainly for 2d quantum well systems since most of our presented results are for 2d semiconductor systems , where the corresponding experiments are feasible .",
    "we note that one can , instead of discussing the conductivity @xmath48 , equivalently discuss the relaxation time @xmath41 or the resistivity @xmath49 or the mobility @xmath50 , which is defined as @xmath51 obtaining the density dependent conductivity @xmath0 now becomes equivalent to obtaining the density dependence of @xmath41 or @xmath50 since @xmath52 ( or @xmath53 ) .",

    "but the relation @xmath61 always applies .",
    "the main goal of the current work is to calculate the exponent @xmath62 for various specified disorder mechanism , and discuss / contrast how the density scaling exponent depends on the type of disorder controlling the resistive scattering mechanism",
    ".    we will obtain @xmath62 analytically in various limiting situations in our theoretical study .",

    ", @xmath62 will depend strongly on the background disorder , and will vary smoothly as a function of carrier density as different scattering mechanisms are operational in different density regimes and as the background coulomb disorder is screened differently at different carrier density through the variation in @xmath28 .",
    "an important surprising finding of our theory is an interesting nonmonotonic variation in the scaling exponent @xmath62 as a function of carrier density .",
    "it is important to point out at this stage that graphene , because of its linear dispersion with a constant fermi velocity ( @xmath64 ) , does not obey @xcite the exponent scaling relation @xmath65 connecting the density scaling between conductivity ( @xmath4 ) and relaxation rate ( @xmath59 ) . instead , for graphene @xcite , we have @xmath66 if @xmath59 is defined by @xmath67 which follows from the constancy of @xmath39 and the fact that @xmath68 in graphene . putting @xmath69 in eq .",

    "it is worthwhile to point out here that the theoretical idea of a meaningful universal density scaling behavior of conductivity applies as a matter of principle only when the resistive scattering is dominated by a particular disorder mechanism .",
    "if there are many different types of disorder ( i.e. , several @xmath79-types ) contributing equivalently to the resistivity , then the net resistivity will be given by the matthiessen s rule : @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , i.e. , @xmath91 , where @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 are respectively the resistivity , conductivity , scattering time for the @xmath79-th type of disorder arising from @xmath78 in eq .",

    "we believe that the experimental finding of @xmath488 by hirakawa and sakaki is a direct verification of our intriguing prediction of @xmath490 for @xmath491 in transport dominated by remote scattering .",
    "\\(8 ) finally , we discuss some recent unpublished experimental work by pfeiffer and west @xcite who , motivated by our theoretical work , carried out low - temperature transport measurements in a series of high - quality ( i.e. ultrapure gaas with very little background disorder due to unintentional impurities ) mbe - grown 2d n - gaas samples with variable values of @xmath7 . since these experiments were performed with the specific goal of checking our low - temperature 2d transport theory predictions , pfeiffer and west made undoped gated samples of highest quality with little background disorder and a nominal low - temperature mobility of @xmath492 @xmath464/vs . then , they systematically introduced charged impurities at specific separation ( @xmath7 ) from the 2d layer by inserting carbon atoms in the gaas layer ( @xmath147 ) or in algaas barrier layer ( @xmath493 ) .",
    "first they explicitly verified that the introduction of different amounts of impurity centers without changing @xmath7 only affects the 2d mobility through the expected @xmath494 scaling behavior ( i.e. @xmath495 ) without changing @xmath62 by changing the inserted carbon atoms by a factor 5 keeping @xmath7 fixed ( which changed the 2d mobility by a factor of 5 without changing the exponent @xmath62 in the same carrier density range ) .",
    "thus , they measured @xmath62 for @xmath147 and @xmath496  finding @xmath497 and 1.8 respectively for @xmath498 @xmath244 . our calculated @xmath11(@xmath499 @xmath244)@xmath500 for @xmath147 in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] in perfect agreement with the experimental data . for @xmath496  , @xmath501 for @xmath499 @xmath244 , and we predict @xmath502 in this situation which compares well with the experimental exponent of 1.8 .",
    "thus , this experimental investigation of our theoretical predictions appears to have strikingly verified our finding that @xmath490 in the @xmath5 intermediate density regime where the shallow maximum occurs in @xmath62 in our theory .",
    "\\(9 ) before concluding our discussion of experimental implications of our theory we describe the very recent 2d hole transport data in high - mobility p - gaas systems by the manfra group @xcite . these 2d p - gaas samples with hole mobility",
    "@xmath503 @xmath464/vs are the world s highest mobility hole samples ever , and taking into account the effective mass difference ( @xmath504 a factor of 5 ) between gaas electrons and holes compare favorably with the best ( @xmath505 @xmath464/vs ) available 2d electron mobilities .",
    "the main finding of the work @xcite is that the mobility exponent @xmath62 increases from 0.7 at high hole density ( @xmath506 @xmath507 ) to 1.7 at low density ( @xmath451 @xmath244 ) for modulation doped sample with @xmath508  .",
    "since the mobility remains high throughout ( @xmath509 @xmath464/vs ) , localization effects should not be playing a role .",
    "we therefore believe that the experimental finding of watson _ et al . _",
    "@xcite is a direct confirmation of the @xmath62 behavior for 2d holes presented in our figs .",
    "[ fig : five ] and [ fig : six ] , where the total calculated @xmath62 increases monotonically as the 2d hole density decreases from @xmath510 @xmath244 to @xmath511 @xmath244 .",

    "thus , our theory provides a qualitative explanation of the watson _",
    "et al_. experimental results including the surprising finding of the intermediate - density @xmath11 being around 1.7 ( @xmath514 ) .",
    "\\(10 ) we conclude this section on the experimental relevance of our theory by discussing graphene briefly .",
    "there has been substantial research activity on studying the density dependent graphene conductivity @xcite which is well beyond the scope of our current work and has already been covered elsewhere .",
    "it is known that scattering by near random charged impurities located on the surface of the graphene layer or at the graphene - substrate interface leads to a @xmath515 ( i.e. , @xmath516 constant ) in the intermediate density ( @xmath441 ) region , and in the high - density regime @xmath0 becomes sublinear most likely because of short - range defect scattering which gives @xmath517 constant ( i.e. , @xmath518 )  see table i for details .",
    "theory predicts ( table i ) that for @xmath152 , i.e. , remote coulomb disorder , @xmath63 and @xmath0 should cross - over to @xmath519 and @xmath520 in graphene .",
    "this clear prediction could be verified by putting an impurity layer ( e.g. a sio@xmath521 film ) at various values of @xmath7 from the graphene layer and measuring @xmath0 to check if the low - density ( @xmath225 ) @xmath522 behavior indeed crosses over to the high density @xmath523 behavior as we predict theoretically . in graphene , with a valley degeneracy of 2 , @xmath524 , where @xmath525 , and @xmath526@xmath244 .",
    "hence , for @xmath527 @xmath244 and @xmath283  @xmath528 .",
    "thus , the condition @xmath214 would require an impurity layer at @xmath529  ( with consequent very weak coulomb disorder scattering ) which may lead to the complication that the subsequent graphene resistivity will be entirely dominated by any underlying short - range disorder ( with @xmath530 ) , masking any @xmath339 behavior arising from charged impurity scattering .",
    "one possibility would be to put suspended graphene near a thick layer ( of thickness @xmath531 ) of disordered substrate with a 3d charged impurity distribution , which would lead to [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eq41])([eq : eq43 ] ) : @xmath532\\ ] ] with @xmath131 being the 3d impurities density in the impurity layer and @xmath533 , giving @xmath520 for @xmath534 and @xmath535 for @xmath536 .",
    "such a 3d impurity layer underneath graphene may manifest the superlinear @xmath537 conductivity behavior predicted by the theory , but observing the shallow maximum in the exponent @xmath4/@xmath11 for @xmath538 may still be difficult .",
    "in this section , just before our conclusion in the next section , we discuss `` other effects '' completely left out of our theoretical considerations which may compromise and complicate direct quantitative comparisons between our theory and experiment although we believe that our theoretical conclusions should apply generically to transport in high - mobility 2d semiconductor systems at low enough temperatures .",
    "first , phonon effects are neglected in the theory since we explicitly consider the @xmath13 situation ( in practice , @xmath539 mk is the typical low - temperature experimental situation mimicking the @xmath13 theoretical situation ) . for consistency between theory and experiment ,",
    "the transport data must therefore be taken at a fixed temperature @xmath540 , where @xmath33 is the so - called bloch - grneisen temperature , so that acoustic phonon scattering contribution to the resistivity is negligible compared with disorder scattering even in the high - mobility 2d semiconductor structures under consideration in this work .",
    "( optical phonon transport is of no relevance for low - temperature transport since @xmath541 is explicitly satisfied as @xmath542 k typically . )",
    "@xmath33 is given either by the debye temperature ( for 3d metals ) or by the energy of the acoustic phonons with @xmath543-wave vector ( for 2d semiconductors ) , whichever is lower .",
    "we therefore have @xmath544 where @xmath545 is the relevant acoustic phonon velocity in the material . putting in the appropriate sound velocity ( @xmath545 ) ,",
    "we get @xmath546 k ; @xmath547 k in 2d gaas and graphene , respectively , where @xmath281 is measured in units of @xmath282 @xmath244 . thus , down to carrier density @xmath548 @xmath244 ,",
    "it is reasonable to ignore phonon effects in transport at @xmath549 mk .",
    "acoustic phonon scattering has been considered elsewhere in the literature @xcite .",
    "second , we have used the born approximation in calculating the scattering time and the rpa in calculating the screened coulomb disorder throughout . both of these approximations surely become increasingly quantitatively inaccurate at lower carrier density although they should remain qualitatively valid unless there is a metal - insulator transition ( obviously , our drude - boltzmann transport theory would not apply at or below any metal - insulator transition density ) .",
    "rpa screening theory becomes increasingly quantitatively inaccurate as carrier density ( or the corresponding @xmath550 parameter ) decreases ( increases ) , but there is no well - accepted systematic method for incorporating low - density electronic correlation effects going beyond rpa screening . including low - density correlation effects in hubbard - type local field theories do not change any of our qualitative conclusion . as for multiple scattering effects @xcite beyond born approximation , they typically lead to higher - order corrections to the resistivity so that @xmath551 , where @xmath137 is the impurity density , is no longer valid and one must incorporate high - order nonlinear corrections to the resistivity going as @xmath552 and higher .",
    "these nonlinear multiscattering corrections become quantitatively important for @xmath553 , and can be neglected for @xmath554 regime , which is of our main interest in this paper .",
    "our neglect of multiscattering corrections beyond born approximation is consistent with our neglect of strong localization effect , both of which will become important in the very low carrier density regime ( @xmath555 ) where the drude - boltzmann theory becomes manifestly inapplicable .",
    "third , we ignore all nonlinear screening effects , which have been much discussed in the recent graphene literature @xcite where charged impurity induced inhomogeneous electron - hole puddle formation plays an important role at low carrier density , since they are important only at very low carrier density ( @xmath555 ) where our whole boltzmann theoretical approach becomes suspect any way .",
    "for the same reason we also do not take into account any scattering - screening self - consistency effect @xcite which may also become important at very low carrier density ( again , for @xmath555 ) .",
    "fourth , we ignore any possible spatial correlation effects among impurity locations , assuming the disorder to arise from completely uncorrelated random impurity configurations . if the impurities are spatially correlated , it is straightforward to include the correlation effect in the boltzmann transport calculation by simply multiplying the disorder potential term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq7 ] ) by the corresponding structure factor @xmath556 for the impurity distribution , i.e. , by writing @xmath557 in eq .  ( [ eq : eq7 ] ) where @xmath558 where @xmath559 denotes the position of each impurity and the sum going over all the impurities . this , if experimental information about impurity correlations exists , it is then straightforward to include such spatial correlation effects in the boltzmann transport calculations , as has indeed been done in both 2d gaas@xcite and graphene @xcite .",
    "since intrinsic impurity correlation information is typically unavailable , our model of uncorrelated random disorder seems to be the obvious choice from a theoretical perspective since it involves only one ( the impurity density @xmath137 ) or two ( @xmath137 and the impurity location @xmath7 ) unknown parameters ( and most often @xmath7 is known from the modulation doping setback distance and is thus not a free parameter ) whereas including impurity spatial correlations would invariably involve the introduction of more unknown free parameters making the theory of dubious theoretical relevance . since our interest in this paper is not an absolute calculation of the conductivity or mobility ( and hence @xmath137 typically drops out of our theory if only one dominant scattering mechanism is operational ) , but obtaining the universal density dependence of conductivity , it is important to mention that the main effect of impurity correlation is to suppress the effect of @xmath137 on the resistivity without much affecting the carrier density dependence particularly for @xmath560 regime of our interest .",
    "we mention that any intrinsic impurity correlations actually increase the value of mobility from our uncorrelated random disorder theory and thus compensate to some extent the suppression of mobility arising from some of the effects discussed above .",
    "fifth , for our @xmath13 theory to be strictly applicable to the experimental data , the experimental temperature @xmath561 should satisfy the condition @xmath562 , where @xmath563 is the corresponding fermi temperature of the system . using the known dependence of @xmath38 on the 2d carrier density @xmath2",
    "we see that this implies @xmath564 for 2d n - gaas , @xmath565 for 2d p - gaas , and @xmath566 for graphene where @xmath526@xmath244 .",
    "thus , low - temperature experiments carried out at @xmath567 mk satisfy our @xmath13 theoretical constraint very well down to @xmath568 @xmath244 carrier density ( except for 2d p - gaas hole system where the density cut off is perhaps @xmath569 @xmath244 ) . our direct numerical calculations at finite temperatures ( not shown in this paper ) show that our calculated exponents @xmath62 and @xmath570 at @xmath13 continue to be quantitatively accurate upto @xmath571 as long as the experimental data for density dependence are taken at a fixed temperature . thus our theory and numerics for @xmath62 and @xmath3 are quite robust against thermal effects as long as phonons are unimportant ( i.e. , @xmath572 is satisfied ) .",
    "we conclude this section of `` other effects '' by noting that the most important drawback of our rpa - drude - boltzmann theory is that it may fail systematically at low carrier density ( @xmath573 ) where important physical effects ( which are difficult to treat theoretically ) such as strong localization , metal - insulator transition , nonlinear screening , inhomogeneous puddle formation , multiscattering corrections , screening - scattering self - consistent , etc .",
    "may all come into play making both our theory inapplicable to the experimental situation .",
    "we do , however , anticipate our theory to be applicable to very low carrier densities ( @xmath574 @xmath244 ) in ultra - high mobility 2d gaas and graphene systems where @xmath575 @xmath244 typically .",
    "a convenient experimental measure of the applicability of our theory is looking at the dimensionless quantity @xmath576 where @xmath577 is the elastic mean free path defined by @xmath578 where @xmath41 and @xmath39 are respectively the transport relaxation time and fermi velocity .",
    "we find that @xmath579 for 2d gaas systems , where @xmath526@xmath244 and @xmath580 @xmath464/vs ) whereas @xmath581 for graphene .",
    "as long as @xmath582 , our drude - boltzmann theory should be valid qualitatively and we therefore conclude that the theory remains quantitatively accurate for @xmath513 @xmath244 ( @xmath583 @xmath244 ) for 2d gaas ( graphene ) systems in high - quality / high - mobility samples . thus , there is a large range of carrier density ( @xmath584 for 2d gaas and @xmath585 for graphene ) where our predictions for universal density dependence can be experimentally tested through low - temperature transport measurements .",
    "the fact that all the `` other effects '' left out of our theory affects transport at low carrier densities indicates that our predicted density scaling of conductivity will systematically disagree with the experimental data at lower carrier densities .",
    "of course , `` lower '' density is a relative term , and the dimensionless quantities such as @xmath586 and @xmath576 are the appropriate quantities to define the regime of validity of our theory .",
    "as @xmath586 and/or @xmath576 ( or even @xmath587 or @xmath588 ) become smaller , the drude - boltzmann theoretic predictions become increasingly unreliable .",
    "nevertheless , the theory remains predictive down to @xmath282 @xmath244 carrier density ( or lower ) in high quality ( i.e. low values of @xmath137 ) gaas samples at low temperatures ( @xmath549 mk ) .",
    "we have developed a detailed quantitative theory for the density - dependence of the zero - temperature conductivity ( or equivalently mobility ) of ( mainly ) 2d and 3d electron and hole metallic systems assuming transport to be limited by ( mainly coulomb ) disorder scattering within the semiclassical drude - boltzmann transport theory .",
    "we neglect all quantum interference ( hence localization ) effects as well as interaction effects ( except for the carrier screening of the bare impurity coulomb disorder , which is an essential qualitative and quantitative ingredient of our theory ) assuming them to be small since our interest is the density dependence ( rather than the temperature dependence ) of transport properties at low fixed temperatures in high - mobility ( @xmath589 where @xmath577 is the elastic mean free path ) samples .",
    "we have systematically considered 3d and 2d doped ( n- and p- ) semiconductor systems as well as 2d graphene but the primary focus has been on n - gaas and p - gaas quantum well based 2d electron or hole systems , mainly because these systems continue to be of great interest in physics and because the carrier density can easily be tuned in such high - mobility 2d semiconductor systems , and the mobility is dominated by coulomb disorder at low temperatures .",
    "we have taken into account both long - range coulomb disorder from charged impurities and zero - range disorder arising from possible non - coulombic short range scatterers .",
    "the primary focus has been the coulombic disorder since this is the main low - temperature resistive scattering mechanism in semiconductors . instead of discussing the nonuniversal values of @xmath50 ( and @xmath48 ) , which depend @xcite on the actual impurity content , we focus on the universal power - law density scaling of transport properties : @xmath590 and @xmath591 with @xmath75",
    ". these exponents @xmath11 and @xmath4 are sample - independent and depend only on the nature of the dominant disorder .",
    "we provide asymptotic theoretical analysis of @xmath11 and @xmath4 ( for various types of underlying disorder ) in the high and the low density regime and for near and far impurities .",
    "we have then verified our analytical results with direct numerical calculations based on the full solution of the boltzmann transport theory in the presence of disorder scattering .",
    "although our work is primarily theoretical , we provide a critical comparison with various experimental results in the literature ( in 2d n - gaas electrons and p - gaas holes ) , finding generally good agreement between our theoretically predicted exponents @xmath11 and @xmath4 and low - temperature experimental findings in high - mobility 2d electron and hole systems .",
    "in particular , a truly exciting prediction , that @xmath62 has a maximum universal value @xmath393 for all 2d systems at an intermediate carrier density value ( approximately defined by @xmath5 ) , seems to be consistent with recent ( and old ) experimental results from several different groups ( and for both 2d electrons and holes ) , as discussed in details in sec .",
    "our theory predicts @xmath62 to vary from @xmath343 in the low - density strong - screening regime ( @xmath210 , @xmath592 ) to @xmath215 in the high density weak screening regime ( @xmath213 , @xmath276 ) with a shallow maximum of @xmath488 at intermediate carrier density for @xmath5 where @xmath7 is the impurity location .",
    "although our work presented in this article is purely theoretical describing the density dependent and disorder - limited @xmath13 conductivity of 2d/3d carriers using the semiclassical boltzmann theory approach , it is worthwhile to speculate about the prospects for the experimental observation of our asymptotic low ( @xmath593 ; @xmath594 ) and high ( @xmath595 ; @xmath596 ) density behavior of coulomb disorder limited 2d semiconductor transport .",
    "these limiting exponents are theoretically universal .",
    "we first summarize the current experimental status in the context of our theory .",
    "for scattering by background coulomb disorder ( i.e. , near impurities with @xmath597 ) , @xmath598 typically , and for scattering by remote impurities ( @xmath599 ) in the modulation doping layer @xmath600 typically with a few atypical cases showing @xmath601 ( @xmath602 ) around @xmath12 .",
    "all of these are intermediate density results in our theory where @xmath182 ( @xmath603 ) and @xmath604 are neither extremely large nor extremely small .",
    "thus the basic experimental situation is in excellent agreement with our theory as it should be because the 2d doped semiconductor transport ( as well as graphene ) is known to be dominated by screened coulomb disorder with near or far charged impurities being the dominant scattering mechanism depending on the sample and carrier density .",
    "first , we discuss the high - density situation which is theoretically more straightforward and where the boltzmann theory is almost exact . as carrier density increases ,",
    "the semiclassical boltzmann theory becomes increasingly more valid for coulomb disorder limited transport properties since the conductivity itself and consequently @xmath576 increases , thus making the system progressively more metallic .",
    "in addition , increasing density decreases the metallic @xmath22-parameters , the dimensionless wigner - seitz radius , given by @xmath605 for 2d semiconductor systems . since @xmath606 , at high carrier density ( e.g. , @xmath607 , 2.5 for 2d n - gaas , p - gaas respectively at @xmath527 @xmath244 ) @xmath22 is small , making our theory using rpa screened effective coulomb disorder to be systematically more valid at higher carrier density as rpa becomes exact at low @xmath22 .",
    "thus , it appears that the ideal applicability of our theory is in obtaining the high - density 2d system .",
    "this is indeed true except that new physical ( rather than theoretical ) complications arise making it problematic for a direct comparison between our theory and experiment on 2d systems at high carrier density .",
    "two new elements of physics come into play at high carrier density , both contributing to the suppression ( enhancement ) of mobility ( scattering rate ) : intersubband scattering becomes important as the fermi level moves up and comes close to ( or crosses over into ) the higher confined subbands of the quasi-2d quantum well , thus opening up a new scattering channel ; and , short - range scattering at the interface and by alloy disorder ( in algaas ) becomes important as the self - consistent electric field created by the electrons themselves pushes the carriers close to the interface at high carrier density . both of these physical effects eventually suppress the monotonic growth of @xmath608 and @xmath0 with increasing density , and eventually @xmath63 starts decreasing with increasing carrier density at high enough density ( for @xmath609 @xmath244 in gaas - algaas systems ) instead of continuing as @xmath610 as it would in the high - density regime if coulomb disorder is the only dominant scattering mechanism with no other complications . since at high density @xmath611 with @xmath295 for coulomb disorder , eventually at some ( nonuniversal sample dependent ) high density , coulomb disorder becomes insignificant compared with the short - range scattering effects . obviously , the density at which this happens is non - universal and depends on all the details of each sample .",
    "but in all 2d systems and samples , eventually , when coulomb disorder induced scattering rate is sufficiently small , a high density regime is reached where the mobility stops increasing ( and even starts decreasing ) . in si",
    "mosfets @xcite this effect is very strong already around @xmath612 @xmath244 because of considerable surface roughness scattering at the si - sio@xmath521 interface , and @xmath63 decreases with increasing @xmath2 at higher density . even in high - mobility gaas systems , @xmath63 saturates ( i.e. , @xmath343 ) and eventually starts decreasing at a non - universal density around @xmath613 @xmath244 .",
    "boltzmann transport theory can be easily generalized to incorporate inter - subband scattering and surface scattering , but the physics is nonuniversal and beyond the scope of our current work .",
    "the low - density ( @xmath349 ) situation is fundamentally inaccessible to our boltzmann transport theory since all doped semiconductor systems ( 3d or 2d ) eventually undergo an effective metal - insulator transition at ( a nonuniversal ) low ( critical ) density with the semiclassical boltzmann theory eventually becoming invalid as a matter of principle at a sufficient low sample - dependent carrier density . in 3d",
    ", this transition may be a true anderson localization transition as @xmath614 with decreasing density making the boltzmann theory inapplicable . in 2d semiconductors , which are the systems of our main interest , the observed metal - insulator transition at a nonuniversal sample dependent critical density @xmath615 is likely to be a crossover phenomenon @xcite since the scaling theory of anderson localization predicts 2d to be the critical dimension with no localization transition .",
    "there is considerable experimental support for the observed low - density 2d metal - insulator transition to be a density inhomogeneity - driven percolation transition at a nonuniversal critical density @xmath615 where charged impurity induced coulomb disorder drives the system into an inhomogeneous collection of `` puddles '' with a mountain and lake potential landscape where semiclassical metallic transport becomes impossible for @xmath616 with @xmath615 being the disorder - dependent percolation transition density @xcite .",
    "the critical density @xmath615 depends crucially on the sample quality and is typically below @xmath568 @xmath244 in high - mobility gaas systems  in si mosfets , where disorder is very strong , @xmath617 @xmath244 , and this is why we have left out 2d si systems from our consideration in this work although our basic theory applies well to 2d si - based systems for @xmath618 @xmath244 .",
    "our semiclassical boltzmann theory works for @xmath619 , but for @xmath620 , one must include the inhomogeneous puddle formation and the associated percolation transition even in the semiclassical theory @xcite .",
    "this is the reason our theory fails for real 2d systems in the @xmath349 limit unless the level of disorder is extremely low ( even then our boltzmann theory is valid only for @xmath621 and the @xmath349 limit is fundamentally inaccessible ) .    in spite of this fundamental difficulty in accessing the low - density ( i.e. @xmath349 ) limit using our theory directly",
    ", it turns out that we can approximately include the effect of a semiclassical percolation transition in our theory by an indirect technique in the density regime @xmath622 above the effective metal - insulator transition ( but still in a reasonably low density regime for high - quality samples where @xmath615 can be very low ) .",
    "since the percolation picture essentially eliminates a certain fraction of the carriers from being metallic , we can assume that the effective conductivity ( mobility ) for @xmath619 is given by the same exponent @xmath4 ( @xmath11 ) calculated in our theory with the only caveat that @xmath4 ( @xmath11 ) is now the exponent only for the actual `` metallic '' free mobile carrier fraction of the whole system .",
    "we can then write : @xmath623 where @xmath62 is the real exponent we calculate theoretically from the boltzmann theory and @xmath624 is the effective ( apparent ) exponent obtained experimentally from @xmath625 by using the actual data for @xmath63 without taking into account any complications arising from the existence of @xmath615 . using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eq68 ] ) and ( [ eq : eq69 ] ) , we immediately get the following relationship connecting the effective exponent @xmath626 with the real exponent @xmath11 for @xmath619 @xmath627 for @xmath619 .",
