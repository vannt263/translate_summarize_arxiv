    "the hot ( @xmath6k ) and tenuous ( central density , @xmath7@xmath8 ) x - ray emitting gas found in rich clusters of galaxies is an excellent tool to probe the cluster dynamics , morphology , and history .",
    "the intra - cluster gas accounts for @xmath9 1015% of the total cluster mass and thanks to its short relaxation time scale , it can track the cluster global gravitational potential . the main emission mechanism of the gas",
    "is the thermal bremsstrahlung that is proportional to @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is the numerical density of electrons ) . besides density and temperature , the observed",
    "thermal bremsstrahlung emission may give estimations of the gas metallicity and of the line - of - sight column density of hydrogen .",
    "the abundance of metals in the intracluster gas is a sign of early enrichment by material processed in stars",
    ". the determination of precise abundances of iron and @xmath5-elements ( nuclei formed by the fusion of @xmath5-particles in massive stars ) can provide strong constraints for the early evolution of galaxies and the galaxy - cluster medium interaction .    in the last couple of years , the cluster abell  85 ( richness class 1 , cd type , optical redshift 0.056 ) has been extensively studied ( cf .",
    "pislar et al .",
    "1997 ; lima neto et al . 1997 ; bagchi et al .",
    "1998 ) . using data from the rosat satellite detectors pspc ( imagery and spectroscopy ) and hri ( high resolution imagery )",
    ", it was possible to draw substantial new conclusions about this cluster . through the use of wavelet techniques , lima neto et al .",
    "( 1997 ) were able to detect a central excess in the x - ray emission which has been identified with a cooling - flow of about 50150 m@xmath12yr ( based on a multi - phase model of the gas ) .",
    "moreover , they have confirmed the presence of 3 small x - ray features around the centre ( cf .",
    "prestwich et al .",
    "1995 ) which may be a sign of inhomogeneities in the central cooling - flow .",
    "the second most important x - ray feature in abell  85 is a blob to the south of the main structure ( called the ` south blob ' hereafter ) .",
    "this blob is definitely a sub - structure in the x - ray map and coincides with a small group of galaxies ( the second brightest cluster member is there ) .",
    "however , these galaxies do _ not _ seem to form a gravitationally bound group and may be part of a chain of galaxies extending to the neighbouring cluster abell  87 ( durret et al .",
    "the radio maps of the south blob also show intense , very steep spectrum radio emission at meter wavelengths ( the vla map , see below and also joshi et al .",
    "1986 ; bagchi et al .",
    "most of this emission is diffuse in nature and extends over 4 arcmin ( @xmath13kpc ) but not associated with any particular galaxy .",
    "this , and another similar diffuse radio source @xmath14mpc to north - west ( vssrs 0038 - 096 ) are the principal unexplained radio features in abell 85 .",
    "the radio observations of diffuse synchrotron radiation strongly suggest the presence of large scale magnetic field , @xmath15 , and relativistic electrons in clusters of galaxies .",
    "these electrons interact not only with magnetic fields but also with the 3k cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) .",
    "the scatter of the electrons and the cmb through inverse compton effect ( ic/3k ) will produce x - ray photons ( e.g. feenberg & primakoff 1948 ; rephaeli & gruber 1988 ) . the best place to look for a co - spatial ic/3k and synchrotron radiation is on a very steep spectrum radio source ( vssrs ) .",
    "these sources , possibly the remnants of former radio galaxies but presently not identifiable with galaxies , are commonly known as cluster ` radio - relics ' and ` radio - haloes ' ( cf .",
    "feretti & giovannini 1996 and kronberg 1994 for reviews ) .",
    "they owe their steep radio spectra to radiative energy losses but are prevented from rapid fading , due to expansion , by the thermal pressure of the surrounding intra - cluster gas ( baldwin & scott 1973 ) .",
    "these vssrs are also possibly the tracers of large scale shock waves that form at the intersection of filaments and sheets of galaxies due to gravity driven supersonic flows of extragalactic matter ( enlin et al .",
    "1998 ; miniati et al .",
    "2000 ; bagchi et al .",

    "we have studied the x - ray excess at the location of the extended vssrs 0038 - 096 in the western part of abell  85 using rosat pspc data and the low frequency radio data ( bagchi et al .",
    "even though rosat has a limited spectroscopic range [ 0.52.4 ]  kev , we were able to derive a value for the magnetic field , @xmath16 g .",
    "we based our estimate on the assumption that the co - spatial radio and x - ray emission are nonthermal synchrotron and ic/3k radiation , respectively , from a common population of relativistic charges .    in this paper",
    ", we present new results based on observation of abell  85 by the x - ray satellite bepposax .",
    "we use the spatially resolved spectroscopy capabilities of the mecs and lecs detectors to determinate independently the temperature , metallicity and line - of - sight hydrogen density column .",
    "furthermore , we try to separate the thermal from the non - thermal x - ray emission in the regions of the vssrs and the south blob , and we give lower limit estimates of the extended magnetic field . in the central region , we determine the properties of the cooling - flow , showing that the x - ray emission in that region is compatible with a metal rich , 2-temperature plasma . moreover , when the signal to noise ratio is high enough we estimate the individual abundances of iron , nickel and @xmath5-elements . unless otherwise stated , we assume @xmath17  km  s@xmath18mpc@xmath18 and @xmath19 ( i.e. , 1 arcmin corresponds to @xmath20 kpc ) .",
    "abell  85 was observed in july 1998 by the bepposax satellite ( boella et al .",
    "1997a ) with two of the narrow field instruments : the low - energy concentrator spectrometer ( lecs , sensitive in the [ 0.110.0 ]  kev range ; parmar et al . 1997 ) and two units of the medium - energy concentrator spectrometer ( mecs 2 and 3 , sensitive in the [ 1.310.5 ]  kev range ; boella et al .",

    "the observation was not pointed at the centre of the cluster , at the position of the central cd galaxy , but at the position of the vssrs 0038 - 096 .",

    "the data have been pre - processed ( linearized and cleaned ) using the saxdas rev .",
    "1.1 package in the ftools 3.5 environment at the bepposax science data centre ( sdc ) and then retrieved through their archive .",
    "we have used the merged data from both mecs units ; they were merged using the saxdas `` meevelin '' program by the sdc ( see fiore et al .",
    "1999 ) .    in order to avoid severe vignetting effects , we have extracted data for scientific analysis only inside a circle of 8 arcmin around the pointing axis of the lecs and mecs instruments ( cusumano & mineo 1998 ) .",
    "the background spectra have been extracted from sky fields devoid of detectable sources and using the same regions on the detectors as the ones used for extracting spectra of abell  85 ( see below the definition of these regions ) .",
    "the total field of view of the mecs units is @xmath23 , but they are supported by a beryllium support that blocks photons with @xmath24 kev ; this effect is _ not _ taken into account in the effective area files ( fiore , private communication ) .",
    "therefore , we restricted our analysis to the area inside the support , i.e. , up to 8 arcmin from the detector axis .",
    "both instruments , lecs and mecs , have moderate spatial resolution , @xmath25 at 0.28  kev and @xmath26 at 6.4 kev ( fwhm ) respectively ( fiore et al .",
    "hence , we have defined sub - regions in the field of view in order to perform separate spectral analysis . the x - ray data in these regions were extracted with xselect 1.4 .",
    "table [ tab : regions ] resumes the characteristics of the regions we have used .",
    "figure [ fig : regionsbeppo ] shows the regions we have selected superposed on the x - ray map derived from the mecs23 data .",
    "this figure also shows the 90  cm radio continuum vla and rosat pspc maps ( isocontour lines ) . for the radio data , we have used the vla c - configuration , archival interferometric data ( programme i d ar279 ) .",
    "the data was obtained in july 1993 with total of 30 minutes of integration on abell  85 at the frequency of 333  mhz and bandwidth of 3.1  mhz . for reduction , the nrao ` aips ' software was employed . following the usual procedure of editing and amplitude and phase calibration ,",
    "the calibrated data was fourier transformed and the @xmath27 degree image was deconvoluted with ` clean ' algorithm .",

    "however , a single temperature plasma model is unable to provide a good fit for the spectrum of the central region of abell  85 when the photon energy is less than 0.4  kev : as is shown in figure [ fig : spectrecentre](a ) , there is a clear excess of soft x - ray photons .",
    "indeed , previous studies of abell  85 have suggested that this cluster houses a strong central cooling flow ( e.g. stewart et al .",

    "we can thus interpret the soft x - ray excess component as evidence for the presence of cool gas .",
    "therefore we have fitted the central region spectrum with a 2-temperature gas model .",
    "when we fix 2 or 3 parameters of the first thermal component , using the `` all field '' mean values , the fits are not significantly improved ( cf . table  [ tbl:2compcentre ] ) .",

    "the parameters of the first component are roughly the same as that obtained in a single component fit , but the temperature of the second component is found to be very small ( less than 0.1  kev at @xmath168 level ) .",

    "the results are summarized in table [ tbl:2compcentre ] .",
    "we have obtained , for the ic/3k emission , a spectral index of 0.4 but the reduced @xmath160 for the composite model is not statistically better than the one of a single mekal model . in fig .",
    "[ fig : vssrsmodelmekal ] we show the best fit model for the vssrs . extrapolating the model to higher energies ,",
    "the ic/3k mechanism starts to dominate the total x - ray flux beyond @xmath231kev ( a well know result ) , outside the range of the mecs detector .",
    "the difficulty found in disentangling the thermal from the non - thermal x - ray emission is due to two main factors : ( i ) the ic/3k emission is relatively weak compared to the thermal one and ( ii ) the bremsstrahlung emission is well approximated by a power - law in the energy interval observed by bepposax .    we have also tried a fit with a fixed value for the spectral index equal to 1 , i.e. , the same spectral index of the vssrs between 10 and 100  mhz ( see fig .",
    "3 of bagchi et al .",
    "again , the fit is not significantly improved but the flux of the ic/3k is not negligible .",
    "notice , however , that the best fit spectral index of 0.4 is consistent with the radio spectrum in the interval [ 1040 ]  mhz , where the spectrum seems to flatten .",
    "furthermore , we have modelled the ic/3k emission as a broken power - law , characterized by two power - law slopes and a breaking point .",
    "we could not obtain a robust fit letting the two slopes being free parameters .",
    "therefore , we fixed the steeper slope , @xmath217 , equal to the observed slope of the radio spectrum in the range [ 100400 ] mhz , i.e. , @xmath232 ( bagchi et al .",
    "1998 ) and fixed the shallower slope ( @xmath216 ) either to 1.0 ( from the radio spectrum ) or to 0.4 , our best fit with a single power - law ( cf .",
    "table  [ tbl:2compcentre ] ) .    in the first case , with @xmath233 ,",
    "the fit is only slightly better than those with a single power - law and the derived ic/3k flux is much smaller than the thermal flux .",
    "unfortunately , we can not obtain a meaningful value for the breaking point . in the second case ,",
    "@xmath234 the fit is still better and the breaking point is well determined at 7.4  kev .",
    "however , the derived fluxes for the thermal and the broken power - law components are almost the same , indicating the confusion in separating the thermal from the non - thermal emission .",
    "sarazin ( 1999 ) has computed the inverse compton spectra for a number of models with different relativistic electron population . for the models with steady particle injection ,",
    "the ic emission spectra in the combined mecs and lecs range would be well represented by a single power - law with slope @xmath235 , where @xmath236 is the logarithm slope of the relativistic electron distribution ( cf .",
    "12 of sarazin 1999 ) .    for the models with no injection of electrons but with an initial population",
    ", the ic emission could only be detectable if the initial population were injected in the cluster at redshift lower than 0.1 ( cf .",
    "13 of sarazin 1999 ) . in this case , a broken power - law is needed to reproduce the ic emission with @xmath237 and @xmath238 ( actually the emission has an exponential cut - off and these slopes are only valid in the range [ 0.110.0 ] kev ) .",
    "we have made fits in the regions we called 1st , 2nd , 3rd rings and n. vssrs . in the 3rd ring and n. vssrs regions ,",
    "the error bars are quite large due to the small number of counts and it is difficult to deduce strong results .",
    "the hydrogen column density and metallicity decrease from the centre to the 2nd ring , while the temperatures of the 1st and 2nd rings are quite larger than in the centre .",
    "in section [ sec : results ] , we have attempted to separate the thermal and non - thermal x - ray emission components at the vssrs and at the south blob regions , where radio observations have detected diffuse synchrotron radiation , showing the presence of magnetic fields and relativistic electrons . here",
    ", we estimate the volume averaged @xmath15 field in these zones , using the non - thermal fluxes ( cf .",
    "table  [ tbl:2compcentre ] ) .",
    "we wish to inject a cautionary note at this stage : in this section the @xmath15 values are expressed as actual estimates , where we have used the nominal results given in table  [ tbl:2compcentre ] .",
    "however , given the non - thermal x - ray fluxes errors bars , these fluxes should be regarded as upper limits .",
    "therefore all our estimates of the @xmath15 field intensities should be ideally treated as only lower limits .      in the first case ( mekal+pow ) , when the spectral indices of non - thermal x - ray and radio photons are both fixed at @xmath239 , the ic/3k flux ( @xmath240 ) is estimated to be @xmath241erg  s@xmath18@xmath3 in 210  kev range and the radio flux ( @xmath242 ) to be @xmath243erg  s@xmath18@xmath3 in 10100  mhz range .",
    "this leads to a field value of @xmath244 g .    in the second case ,",
    "when we have allowed the spectral index to vary , we have obtained the value of @xmath245 , with large error bars ( table  [ tbl:2compcentre ] ) .",
    "this value of spectral index seems roughly consistent with radio spectral shape in the range 1045  mhz ( bagchi , pislar & lima neto 1998 ) . in this case",
    "we have @xmath246erg  s@xmath18@xmath3 and @xmath247erg  s@xmath18@xmath3 . from these , we then obtain @xmath248 g .",
    "finally , we consider the more complex model where the non - thermal spectrum is represented by two power - law forms with a ` spectral break ' in - between ( mekal+2pow ) .",
    "when the low and the high frequency spectral segments are fixed _ a priori _ , with spectral indices @xmath239 and @xmath249 , we once more obtain the magnetic field as @xmath250 g ( but note that the ` break ' value for x - ray photons is not obtained ) .",
    "however , when @xmath216 is fixed at 0.4 and @xmath217 is fixed at 1.85 , we obtain a well constrained value ( 7.4 kev ) for the ` break ' in ic/3k spectrum ( table  [ tbl:2compcentre ] ) .",
    "it is possible to relate this break to a similar break in the radio spectrum since both come from a common electron energy spectrum .",
    "the frequencies of ic/3k photons ( @xmath251 ) and of synchrotron photons ( @xmath252 ) are related by : @xmath253^{-1 } \\ , .\\ ] ] the decametric radio spectrum for the vssrs shown in figure 3 of bagchi et al .",

    "this is obtained as @xmath257 g .",
    "putting together the above results obtained , using the above mean values and standard deviations , results in @xmath258 g .",
    "as per the caveat above , this really is the lower limit to the magnetic field value and should be treated as such .",
    "our new estimate using the _ bepposax _ data is consistent with our earlier estimate ( @xmath259 g ) using rosat data ( bagchi et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "currently , due to insufficient radio data , the spectral index value for the emission from the south blob is not available .",

    "the temperature detected in the south blob is higher than in the other regions of abell  85 .",
    "this result is similar to the one found by markevitch et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ( cf .",

    "( 1998 ) , that is , of a substructure falling in the main body of abell  85 .",
    "the higher temperature in this region , compared with either a region symmetrically opposed towards the north of abell  85 or a region farther to the south , may be explained by a shock that heats the icm .",
    "although , with bepposax , we can not measure temperatures southern from the south blob or much northern from the centre , the higher temperature that we do detect at the south blob and the 2nd ring tends to confirm this picture of merging substructure .",
    "we have also detected , with a @xmath168 level , an excess on neutral hydrogen compared to the galactic value ( from dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "this excess , about 1.5 times the galactic value , also supports the scenario where gas is pouring in this region .",
    "notice , that the @xmath78 measured over the entire 2nd ring ( which contains most of the south blob ) is substantially closer to the galactic value , suggesting that the localised excess at the south blob region is real .",
    "interestingly , the south blob presents a significantly lower abundance of metals compared to the other regions of abell  85 and to its mean value . the 2nd ring , which contains the south blob , has also the same low metal abundance .",
    "if we admit the scenario of durret et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , where a filament of very low surface brightness is falling into abell  85 , along the axis coming from abell  87 and , moreover , abell  87 is in fact composed by poor sub - clusters , then one can suppose that the gas in the filament falling into abell  85 has a rather low metallicity .",
    "this could explain the low abundance determined at the south blob as the mixture of the @xmath263 icm from abell  85 with a lower metal rich gas falling along the filament .",
    "if the south blob is indeed a place where a substructure is merging with the main body of abell  85 , then we may have a strong shock in this region .",
    "such a shock is bound to accelerate the icm electrons to relativistic energies and also may amplify stochastically the pre - existing magnetic fields ( enlin et al .",
    "1998 ; sarazin 1999 ) .",
    "these would in turn produce x - ray emission by ic/3k scattering and the radio synchrotron radiation .",

    "the non - thermal flux is only about 5% of the total flux and the power - law slope is @xmath264 ( @xmath230 ) .",
    "this corresponds to the slope of the relativistic electron energy spectrum of @xmath265 .",
    "the overall abundance detected with bepposax is very close to the one found by pislar et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and it is the usual value found in clusters with the same temperature of abell  85 .",
    "the total abundance determined with the mekal model is quite well constrained , mainly by the prominent fe k@xmath5 complex at @xmath266  kev .",
    "the mean value obtained for the whole cluster is @xmath267 with a @xmath168 error of 0.06 .",

    ". the higher abundance of calcium derived by us may be the result of dust evaporation in the hot icm  the calcium we observe in x - rays is completely ionized .",

    "the outermost ring shows an substantial increase in temperature , but its error bars are very large ( due to the small number of counts ) .    supporting the existence of a central cooling - flow is the fact that we have a better fit using a 2-temperature plasma model , with one of the components being very cold .",
