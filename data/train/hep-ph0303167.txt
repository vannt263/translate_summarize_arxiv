    "the standard model of particle interactions has been much studied and has passed numerous experimental tests @xcite . despite its experimental successes it is commonly believed that it is yet an incomplete model . within the standard model , for example , one does not know what controls the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry since the negative mass squared of the higgs particle is simply assumed .",
    "different models have been proposed to address the problem of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "technicolor theories @xcite and supersymmetric extensions @xcite of the standard model are two relevant examples .    in this paper",
    "we explore the possibility that the relativistic bose - einstein phenomenon , much studied in the literature @xcite , is the source of spontaneous symmetry breaking of a generic gauge theory .",
    "we introduce a chemical potential @xmath1 for some global symmetries of the higgs field .",
    "the generators associated to these symmetries are chosen to commute with the gauge transformations .",
    "a relevant property of the theory is that the chemical potential induces a negative mass squared for the higgs field at the tree level hence destabilizing the symmetric vacuum and triggering symmetry breaking .",
    "the local gauge symmetries are broken spontaneously and the associated gauge bosons acquire a standard mass term .",
    "this is so since we have chosen the global generator associated with the chemical potential to commute with the gauge transformations .",
    "in this way the mass of the higgs boson is intrinsically related to a given charge density while its potential is in fact ( at zero temperature ) the thermodynamical potential .",
    "while the properties of the massive gauge bosons at the tree level are identical to the ones induced by the conventional higgs mechanism , the higgs field encodes all of the information associated to this different way of symmetry breaking .",
    "it has specific non lorentz covariant dispersion relations since the introduction of the chemical potential differentiates between space and time .",
    "however the directly observable part of the theory feels lorentz breaking effects via radiative corrections involving the higgs field .",
    "the size of the corrections to the dispersion relations of a given particle is controlled by the relative coupling strength of the various particles with the higgs .",
    "we start our analysis in a pedagogical way by first reviewing how spontaneous symmetry breaking manifests itself in a relativistic non ideal ( i.e. self - interacting ) bosonic @xmath2 invariant theory with an associated non zero chemical potential . via this simple model",
    "we familiarize with the scalar field dispersion relations in the spontaneously broken phase .",
    "we then consider an example of a gauge theory in which spontaneous symmetry breaking is entirely due to the introduction of a specific chemical potential .",
    "the gauge symmetry is taken to be identical to the one of the standard model i.e. @xmath3 .",
    "the higgs sector of the theory is minimally extended to enable the inclusion of a chemical potential not associated with any of the gauge generators . in the standard model",
    "the higgs sector has an accidental @xmath4 global symmetry where the @xmath5 is gauged and the hypercharge is associated to the diagonal @xmath6 generator .",
    "we consider the extension where the higgs sector contains an extra @xmath7 symmetry . to this extra global symmetry",
    "we then associate a non zero chemical potential which enters with a negative mass squared term in the lagrangian for the higgs leading to the destabilization of the vacuum and spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "so the @xmath8 breaks to an unbroken @xmath9 with three of the gauge bosons acquiring a mass term while the photon remains massless .",
    "@xmath9 is the custodial symmetry which at the tree level guarantees the relation @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the mass of the electromagnetically charged gauge bosons , @xmath12 is the @xmath13 neutral gauge boson mass and @xmath14 is the weinberg angle .",
    "three of the four goldstone bosons , in the unitary gauge , become the longitudinal components of the massive gauge bosons while we are left with an extra massless ( i.e. gapless ) degree of freedom @xmath15 . in the theory",
    "we have one more singlet field which is the neutral higgs @xmath16 . due to the presence of the chemical potential a time dependent lorentz",
    "breaking mixing term between the @xmath16 and the @xmath15 field emerges .",
    "this is the term responsible for non conventional dispersion relations for the @xmath16 and @xmath15 field .",
    "the @xmath15 gap ( the energy at zero momentum ) is still zero while the @xmath16 gap is slightly higher than the mass associated to the potential curvature evaluated on the vacuum of the theory .",
    "hence we predict a higgs sector with very specific dispersion relations and mass spectrum .",
    "different models where the @xmath15 field is not light can also be constructed .",
    "all of the gauge bosons , at the tree level , posses standard lorentz covariant dispersion relations and the lorentz breaking effects for those are felt only via radiative corrections .",
    "the diagrams inducing lorentz breaking include the exchange of the higgs and/or @xmath15 particles .",
    "we have computed the relevant zero momentum one loop contribution to the @xmath17 and @xmath13 vacuum polarizations .",
    "the details of the computation are in the appendix .",
    "since the chemical potential differentiates between time and space and we have a scalar vacuum the dispersion relations are isotropic .",
    "theories with condensates of vectorial type have been studied in different realms of theoretical physics .",
    "to quantify the corrections with respect to the standard model , we have generalized the oblique parameter @xmath0 @xcite to have a lorentz structure @xmath18 where @xmath19 indicates the new physics contributions to the vacuum polarization of the vector bosons .",
    "the lorentz breaking sector preserves the custodial symmetry and we find @xmath20 . however there is an effect on @xmath0 due to the fact that the @xmath16 gap is different than the ordinary mass in the standard model yielding @xmath21 .",
    "the fermionic sector of the standard model has also been investigated .",
    "we have shown that for a generic fermion the dispersion relations are @xmath22 . at the one loop level due to",
    "the smallness of the yukawa coupling @xmath23 is small .",
    "effects of a large lepton number on the spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking for the electroweak theory at high temperature relevant for the early universe have been studied in the literature .",
    "the issue of lorentz breaking has attracted recently theoretical and experimental attention @xcite .",
    "for example in @xcite possible extensions of the standard model were studied in which lorentz symmetry is violated . in @xcite",
    "the authors investigate possible phenomenological consequences due to explicit lorentz breaking terms added to the standard model lagrangian . in the present case lorentz breaking is due to a net background charge density .    in section",

    "it has been shown that the chemical potential associated to a net background charge for a charged scalar field must be introduced at the lagrangian level as follows : @xmath24 and @xmath25 positive constants and @xmath26 and @xmath1 the associated chemical potential . substituting eq.([covariant ] ) in eq.([bose ] ) we have : @xmath27 the grand canonical partition function is : @xmath28\\,[d\\phi^{\\ast}]\\,\\exp\\left[\\int^\\beta_0 \\,d\\tau \\int_v\\,d^3x\\ , { \\cal",

    "so that all of the ultraviolet properties of the theory are identical to the one before adding the chemical potential at zero temperature .",
    "this observation allows us immediately to conclude that if a theory were renormalizable before adding the chemical potential it will remain renormalizable after having introduced it . on the other hand for small momenta and large @xmath1 we have a static field of mass squared @xmath46 and a massless state with @xmath47 dispersion relation .",
    "rotational symmetry remains intact here .",
    "however theories in which rotational symmetry breaks together with some internal global symmetries due to the introduction of a chemical potential have been studied in some detail in @xcite .",

    "however , theoretically a more satisfactory explanation of the origin of the higgs mechanism is needed . in the literature",

    "the chemical potential leaves intact the rotational subgroups of the lorentz transformations , so the effective lagrangian modifies as follows : @xmath152 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath153 is a coefficient effectively measuring the corrections due to modified dispersion relations for the gauge vectors . using the previous lagrangian",
    "the decay rate for the process @xmath154 is : @xmath155=\\frac{g^2 m_{\\mu}^5}{192\\pi^3}\\left(1 + \\frac{3}{2}\\delta\\right ) \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath156 is the muon mass and we neglected the electron mass .",
    "however the effects of a non zero electron mass are as in the standard model case @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath153 can be estimated using the vacuum polarizations presented in the previous section yielding : @xmath157 by choosing the renormalization scale @xmath115 to be of the order of the electroweak scale @xmath158 and @xmath159  gev we determine @xmath160 .",
    "precise and independent measurements of @xmath11 and the muon decay rate may observe deviations with respect to the standard model .",
    "finally we expect sizable corrections to the fermion dispersion relations in eq .",
    "( [ fermion - dr ] ) induced by the gauge boson exchanges .",
    "these arise in the fermion vacuum polarization at the two loop level and are expected to be of the order of @xmath161 .",
    "we have studied some of the effects of a net background charge associated to the global symmetry @xmath7 . when considering possible non abelian extensions of the higgs sector such as the ones naturally present in grand unified theories only chemical potentials corresponding to mutually commuting charges can be introduced .",
    "one also has to differentiate between chemical potentials introduced for global and local symmetries .",
    "the main difference relies on the fact that given a generic thermodynamic potential @xmath162 $ ] we need to impose the following constraints : @xmath163}{\\partial \\mu } \\",
    ", \\qquad   0= \\frac{\\partial \\omega[t;\\mu_{\\rm g},\\mu ] } { \\partial \\mu_{\\rm g } } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the temperature , @xmath1 is a generic chemical potential associated to a globally conserved charge and @xmath164 is related to a gauge symmetry .",
    "these relations express the fact that for charges associated with a global symmetry there is no particular reason why the universe should be neutral .",
    "the situation is more delicate for a gauge symmetry @xcite for which it is usually assumed that the universe must be globally neutral .",
    "actually this is strictly true only if the universe is gravitationally closed .",
    "we however take , following the literature , the second equation to hold .",
    "so , after having determined the thermodynamical potential evaluated on the physical vacuum of the theory one should determine the relations between the various chemical potentials . in general , a non zero @xmath165 chemical potential",
    "is induced to insure gauge neutrality .",
    "the gauge group @xmath3 admits two mutually commuting charges which are any linear combination of the hypercharge and weak isospin @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that in the present case , at zero temperature and in the absence of the chemical potential for the fermions , electroweak neutrality is guaranteed for a zero value of the chemical potentials associated to the two commuting gauge charges and hence our results are unaffected .",
    "we also stress that it is not possible to directly compare the higgs vacuum energy with the cosmological constant since other contributions are supposed to be present in the theory . due to these other unknown contributions a large chemical potential alone does not imply either a large charge or energy density .",
    "we have introduced a new mechanism able to explain the spontaneous symmetry breaking in a generic gauge theory as due to the presence of a net charge density background in the universe .",
    "the present mechanism requires the higgs field to posses global and gauged internal symmetries . to some of the globally conserved charges commuting with all of the gauge transformations we associate a non zero chemical potential",
    "this induces a negative type mass squared triggering spontaneous symmetry breaking of the global and local gauge transformations .",
    "we have studied the effects on the electroweak sector of the standard model as a relevant example in which the higgs sector is minimally extended to have an extra global @xmath7 symmetry with a non zero chemical potential .",
    "the bose - einstein condensation of the higgs induces new type of tree level dispersion relations specific for the higgs field while the dispersion relations of the gauge bosons and fermions remain unmodified .",
    "the latter are affected when considering higher order corrections involving the higgs field . to show how this occurs we explicitly evaluated them for the vacuum polarizations of the gauge bosons at zero external momentum .",
    "these corrections , due entirely to the new higgs sector of the theory , are known to affect some of the oblique parameters .",
    "we first suggested how to generalize the parameter @xmath0 to be applicable to our new higgs sector and then have shown that the value of @xmath0 is tiny and negative in sign .",
    "this is so since our model preserves the custodial symmetry .",
    "what is interesting is that @xmath0 is sensitive to the new way of breaking the symmetry .",
    "the fermion sector of the standard model is , on general grounds , affected by the new mechanism via higher order corrections .",
    "we expect for a generic fermion the appearance of modified dispersion relations of the type @xmath22 . at the one loop level due to",
    "the smallness of the yukawa coupling @xmath23 is small .",
    "spontaneous breaking of a gauge theory via bose - einstein condensation necessarily introduces lorentz breaking since a frame must be specified differentiating time from space .",
    "this must be contrasted with different type of lorentz violation due to an intrinsically modified gravitational theory .",
    "the advantage with our proposal is that it leads to distinctive and computable corrections .",
    "we recall that the issue of lorentz breaking has recently attracted much theoretical and experimental attention @xcite .",
    "for example in @xcite possible extensions of the standard model were studied in which lorentz symmetry is violated . in @xcite",
    "the authors investigate in some detail theoretical extensions and possible observational consequences of the standard model in the presence of lorentz breaking . here",
    "the underlying gravitational theory is not the cause of lorentz breaking which is due instead to having immersed the theory in a background charge .",
    "many new avenues are left unexplored .",
    "for example , one can imagine different types of higgs scenarios where the chemical potential effects and hence the lorentz breaking is more or less felt by the standard model particles",
    ". a very interesting possibility would be to study supersymmetric extensions of our model .",
    "since fermions and bosons have different statistics the chemical potential would also behave as an explicit source of supersymmetry breaking .",
