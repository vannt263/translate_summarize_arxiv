    "all phases of the interstellar medium ( ism ) are turbulent , and this turbulence has many effects . in the astrophysical literature , turbulence is often treated as yielding a simple addition to the thermal pressure , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the dispersion in the ( one - dimensional ) turbulent velocity , and @xmath14 for gas with a total number density @xmath15 and mass density @xmath16 . this approach is often adopted when analyzing the stratification of interstellar gas clouds and the ism as a whole , with the combined pressure gradients taken to balance the gravitational force per unit volume such that hydrostatic equilibrium is maintained by the total pressure .",
    "the turbulent pressure is believed to be especially important in the cold components of the ism , for which observed linewidths far exceed the values of @xmath17 inferred from excitation of atomic and molecular lines .",
    "models of effective hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction , usually assuming the turbulent and thermal velocity dispersions are constants independent of height , are often applied to observations of the large - scale galactic ism , and to observations of the ism in external galaxies ( e.g. ) .",
    "for example , showed that the observed atomic and molecular disk thicknesses in the milky way can be fit well by assuming effective hydrostatic equilibrium , and accounting for both the gas self - gravity and the external gravitational potential of stars and dark matter . @xcite and",
    "@xcite ( hereafter br06 ) used a simplified approach to hydrostatic equilibrium in order to estimate the midplane gas pressure in a sample of disk galaxies , adopting a single velocity dispersion for the gas , treating the gravitational potential as dominated by the stars , and assuming the stellar disk s scale height is independent of radius .",
    "@xcite extended the analysis of br06 but instead of adopting a constant scale height for the stellar disk , they assumed that the velocity dispersion for the stars is consistent with a state of marginal gravitational instability ( with toomre parameter @xmath18 ) for the corresponding stellar surface density .",
    "they then assumed hydrostatic equilibrium for all ( gaseous and stellar ) components separately , and computed the self - consistent midplane pressure , finding differences of order @xmath19 from the simplified br06 approach .",
    "although widely adopted , the effective hydrostatic equilibrium model for the large - scale ism has not , to our knowledge , been explicitly verified using actual turbulent flows .",
    "one of the goals of this work is to test this formulation systematically , using the solutions of time - dependent numerical hydrodynamic simulations of turbulent , multiphase gas .",
    "in addition to providing support against gravity , pressure also affects the phase balance in the ism . for a static system at a given mean density @xmath20",
    ", changing the pressure alters the proportions of mass divided between dense clouds and diffuse intercloud medium ; e.g. for cold and warm components in pressure equilibrium , the mass ratio of cold to warm gas is @xmath21/[1 - \\bar    n / n_{\\rm cold}]= [ \\bar n k t_{\\rm warm } - p]/[p - \\bar n k t_{\\rm cold}]$ ] . the mean density itself , however , depends on pressure through the condition of vertical hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "turbulent pressure , as it affects the response to external and self - gravity , can be expected to change both the mean density and the mass fractions of dense and diffuse gas . here , we investigate these effects quantitatively .",
    "the fraction of ism mass in dense gas is important from the point of view of galactic evolution , since this component is the immediate precursor to star formation .",
    "a recent observational study of external disk galaxies by br06 identified a linear relationship between the mean ratio of molecular - to - atomic mass , @xmath4 , and an estimate for the total midplane pressure @xmath22 , where @xmath8 is the stellar volume density and @xmath6 is the total gaseous surface density .",
    "br06 propose that the molecular fractions in widely - varying types of galaxies  and hence their respective star formation efficiencies  are therefore determined essentially by a single parameter , the midplane pressure . to investigate this proposal , we use multiphase turbulence simulations in which we independently vary the input galactic `` environmental '' parameters .",
    "the observational study of br06 focused on the dependence of @xmath23 on @xmath8 and @xmath6 , but another important  and independent  environmental parameter is the angular rotation rate @xmath24 ( and the associated epicyclic frequency @xmath25 ) . using our data sets from turbulent simulations , we compare the pressure estimate of br06 to the true value of the pressure , and also test how @xmath23 relates to the mean pressure measured in two different ways .",
    "we note that a number of recent numerical studies have investigated the formation of ism structures with internal densities reaching those similar to giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) .",
    "some studies have focused on how this may occur as a consequence of the collision of large - scale high - velocity flows that shock and cool , becoming turbulent at the same time .",
    "other studies have focused on the ability of self - gravitating instabilities to induce converging flows over sufficiently large scales that massive , high - column density structures similar to observed gmcs are created ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; these models include the galactic shear and rotation that are important on these large scales , and in some cases also include magnetic effects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as spiral arms are observed to be strongly associated with high molecular fractions and star formation , some studies have focused on the interaction between large - scale spiral shocks and self - gravity in inducing gmc formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the details of conversion from diffuse to dense gas by cooling downstream from spiral shock fronts has also recently been studied in the absence of self - gravity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "taken together , these and other recent studies have shown that significant quantities of dense gas form naturally as a result of large - scale ism dynamical processes .",
    "of course , dense gas in the ism is also returned to the diffuse phases by the energetic inputs from star formation . in the present work , by incorporating feedback , we are able to evolve our models until a quasi - steady state is reached .",
    "this enables an analysis of the correlations among statistical properties of the system , in terms of their influence on the fraction of dense gas when the system has reach a quasi - steady state of cloud formation and destruction .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in  2 we briefly summarize our numerical methods .",
    "the specification of model parameters and the results of statistical analysis in comparison to the vertical - equilibrium approximation are presented in  3 . in  4 , we discuss the molecular fraction and investigate how it relates to the ism pressure in our models .",
    "we summerize our results and discuss implications for ism structure and evolution in  5 .",
    "the analysis in this paper are based on time - dependent numerical hydrodynamic simulations of turbulent , multiphase , interstellar gas .",
    "details of our numerical methods are presented in a companion paper ( koyama & ostriker 2008 , hereafter paper i ) ; here , we briefly summarize the model properties and parameterizations .",
    "the models we use are two - dimensional , representing slices through the ism in radial - vertical ( @xmath26 ) planes .",
    "we include sheared galactic rotation , a radial gravitational force ( the centrifugal force and gravity balance in the unperturbed state , which assumes a rotation curve @xmath27 ) , and coriolis forces in the equations of motion , as well as gaseous self - gravity and vertical gravity representing the potential of the stellar disk .",
    "the gas is treated as a single fluid in chemical equilibrium , and we include ( volumetric ) radiative heating and cooling processes as a function of density and temperature appropriate to the range @xmath28 k. the thermal processes we incorporate include photoelectric heating from small grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , heating and ionization by cosmic rays and x - rays , heating by h@xmath29 formation and destruction , atomic line cooling from hydrogen lyman @xmath30 , cii , oi , fe ii , and si ii , rovibrational line cooling from h@xmath29 and co , and atomic and molecular collisions with grains .",
    "we adopt shearing - periodic boundary conditions in the radial direction .    to drive turbulence",
    ", we also include a model of stellar feedback : within `` hii regions '' ( which are defined by contours of the perturbed gravitational potential surrounding regions where the density has exceeded a specified threshold ) , the gas heating rate is increased by a factor 1,000 . as a consequence , gas within these `` hii regions '' heats to temperatures @xmath31k , irrespective of density .",
    "the detailed recipe for the feedback phenomenon is described in @xcite .",
    "our aim is not to represent star formation feedback in a fully realistic manner , but to drive turbulence in a way similar to that which occurs within the dense ism . in this sense ,",
    "our feedback prescription is similar in spirit to simulations of giant molecular clouds in which turbulence is applied via arbitrary forcing functions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , our results should be taken as demonstrating the physical importance of turbulence to setting properties such as the vertical thickness of the disk , not as giving quantitative predictions for what the value of the disk thickness , etc .",
    ", should be .",
    "in our local disk models , three free parameters are needed to characterize the `` galactic environment '' : the total surface density of the gas @xmath6 , the local epicyclic frequency @xmath5 , and the local stellar density @xmath8 . as we assume a flat rotation curve , @xmath32 where @xmath24 is the angular rotation rate at the center of our domain .",
    "the stellar density is used in order to specify the vertical gravity @xmath33 .",
    "following @xcite , we study four series of models to explore the parameter dependence of our results . for each series ,",
    "we hold two quantities fixed and vary a third quantity , as follows :    * series q : @xmath34 and @xmath35 are constant while @xmath6 varies ; * series k : @xmath5 and @xmath35 are constant while @xmath6 varies ; * series r : @xmath34 and @xmath8 are constant while @xmath6 varies ; * series s : @xmath6 and @xmath8 are constant while @xmath5 ( and @xmath24 ) varies",
    ".    since toomre s parameter is proportional to @xmath34 , series q and r would have constant gaseous @xmath36 if the sound speed @xmath17 were constant .",
    "the q and r series correspond to values of @xmath37 . assuming a constant stellar velocity dispersion , @xmath38 , so that the stellar toomre parameter ( hereafter @xmath39 ) would also have the same value for all members of series q. in all members of the r and s series and in the @xmath40 models of the q and k series , we take @xmath41 . in the k series , we use @xmath42 , while in the s series we use @xmath40 .",
    "this paper focuses on how turbulence affects the vertical structure of the galactic ism .",
    "an important aspect of our studies is to understand how the results differ from the situation in which turbulence is absent .",
    "thus , as baselines for comparison , we have two vertical non - turbulent model series : one in which the gas and stellar surface densities are proportional ( series hsp ) , and one in which the stellar surface density is constant ( series hsc ) .",
    "these correspond to dynamical series q and k ( for hsp ) and series r ( for hsc ) , respectively .",
    "these models are one - dimensional in the vertical ( @xmath43 ) direction ; each model represents the asymptotic hydrostatic equilibrium state which develops in the absence of any stellar feedback .",
    "figure [ fig : snapshot ] shows a snapshot of the gas pressure in a dynamical model from series q , compared to the hydrostatic model from series hsp .",
    "the density and temperature are shown for the same snapshot in figure 1 of paper i. in the dynamical model , the pressure overall increases toward the midplane , but there are significant variations associated with structure in the gas ; for the particular snapshot shown , there is also a high - pressure region near the left of the figure , which is associated with a locally - heated star formation feedback region .",
    "the hydrostatic model shows a secular increase in pressure towards the midplane .",
    "we begin by examining the vertical velocity dispersion of gas in all of the model series .",
    "figure [ fig : vz ] shows space- and time - averages ( weighted by mass ) of both the thermal velocity dispersion @xmath44 ( _ circles _ ) and the combined thermal + turbulent velocity dispersion @xmath45 ( _ triangles _ ) .",
    "the four panels correspond to the series q , k , r , and s. in series q and r , the mean thermal velocity dispersion decreases with increasing surface density .",
    "the reason for this is that the mass fraction of cold , dense gas increases with @xmath6 in all of these models ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this is because gravity is lower , and gas is less compressed ( both vertically , and horizontally by self - gravity ) , at low @xmath6 . in series",
    "k , on the other hand , the mean thermal speed has a local minimum at intermediate @xmath6 .",
    "again , this can be understood in terms of the mass fraction of warm gas , which is largest at low and high @xmath6 ( see @xcite ) in this series ; at high @xmath6 , the model is extremely active in terms of feedback because ( with constant @xmath5 ) the disk is quite unstable gravitationally .",
    "for all the series in which @xmath6 is the variable parameter ( i.e. q , k , and r ) , the turbulent part of the total velocity dispersion increases with @xmath6 ; this is because the higher-@xmath6 models have higher feedback rates , and therefore increasing ( or flat ) turbulence levels .",
    "for series s ( with constant @xmath6 ) , the turbulence decrease as @xmath24 increases , as high @xmath5 stabilizes the disk and prevents gravitational collapse and feedback ( see figure 11 in @xcite ) . for all series , the ( mass - weighted ) turbulent vertical velocity dispersion approaches or exceeds the ( mass - weighted ) thermal velocity dispersion for some part of parameter space , so that turbulent support of gas in the vertical gravitational field is expected to be important .",
    "next , we measure ( for all series ) the vertical scale height , using the following averaging : @xmath46 where @xmath43 is the vertical coordinate relative to the midplane .",
    "we further average the values of @xmath47 over time . in order to test",
    "whether the velocity dispersion can be used to obtain an accurate measure of the scale height , we also compute `` estimated '' vertical scale heights defined as : @xmath48^{1/2 } } = \\frac{\\sigma_z}{\\sqrt{4\\pi g \\rho _ * } } \\frac{1 } { a+\\left[a^2 + 1\\right]^{1/2}}\\label{hest_eq } \\\\ & = & \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll } \\displaystyle \\frac{\\sigma_z}{\\sqrt{4\\pi g\\rho_{\\ast } } } & ( \\sigma \\to 0)\\\\ \\displaystyle \\frac{\\sigma_z^2}{\\sqrt{8\\pi}g\\sigma } & ( \\rho_{\\ast } \\to 0 ) . \\end{array } \\right . \\ ] ] this formula ( see appendix for derivation ) accounts for both gas self - gravity and stellar gravity ; the limiting forms are for negligible gaseous and stellar gravity , respectively .    in equation ( [ hest_eq ] ) , @xmath49 is a dimensionless factor that measures the relative densities of the gaseous and stellar disks , @xmath50 the latter expression treats the stellar disk as an isothermal self - gravitating equilibrium , with @xmath51 , and shows that @xmath52 ( assuming that vertical and radial velocity dispersions are proportional ) .",
    "the formula ( [ hest_eq ] ) may be thought of as an extension of the usual non - self - gravitating scale height formula to account for the gravity of the gas . since @xmath53 , the correction factor depending on @xmath49",
    "is always @xmath54 .",
    "if the gas disk is much more gravitationally unstable than the stellar disk ( @xmath55 ) , the correction factor is large ; otherwise the correction factor is order - unity .",
    "figure [ fig : have ] shows the measured ( @xmath47 ) and `` predicted '' ( @xmath56 ) disk scale heights for all series of hydrodynamic models . for @xmath56 , we show results using for @xmath57 either the thermal velocity dispersion ( @xmath58 ; subscript @xmath59 ) or the total velocity dispersion ( @xmath60 ; subscript @xmath61 ) . to show how turbulence contributes to setting the disk thickness",
    ", @xmath47 is also shown for the hydrostatic models .",
    "the difference between @xmath47 in hydrostatic and hydrodynamic models can be quite large , up to a factor 10 in some cases .",
    "we note that @xmath47 of the hydrostatic models ( _ filled boxes _ )",
    "differs from @xmath62 ( _ open circles _ ) because the mass - weighted mean sound speed differs for hydrostatic and hydrodynamic models .",
    "overall , figure [ fig : have ] shows that the estimate for scale height @xmath63 that includes turbulence traces the measured @xmath47 quite well , for all the series .",
    "the difference between @xmath62 and @xmath63 increases with increasing @xmath6 , with quite large differences for some of the models in series q and r. this indicates that high surface density disks are supported largely by turbulent velocities , in these cases . to facilitate comparisons between estimated and measured value of the scale height , in the lower part of each panel we also show the ratios @xmath64 ( _ circles _ ) and @xmath65 ( _ triangles _ ) . at low values of @xmath6 in series q ,",
    "k , and r , both estimates of @xmath66 exceed the true measured value .",
    "it is notable that where the turbulent contributions are large , at high @xmath6 in series q , k , and r , the estimated and measured disk thicknesses are in quite good agreement ( within @xmath67 ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that if measurements of the vertical velocity dispersion together with the gaseous surface density and stellar surface density can be made observationally , they can be combined to yield an accurate estimate of the gas disk s thickness .",
    "the gaseous pressure , like the scale height , is often difficult to measure directly . as a consequence ,",
    "other proxies are often used to obtain an estimate of the value of the pressure , with an assumption that vertical equilibrium is satisfied . here",
    ", we test how well such pressure estimates agree with the directly - measured pressure , for our multiphase turbulent models .",
    "figure [ fig : pressure ] shows for all models in all hydrodynamic series the average gas pressure .",
    "we consider two different ways of averaging : weighting by mass @xmath68 ( _ open box _ ) , and weighting by volume @xmath2 ( _ open circle _ ) .",
    "the value @xmath68 is interesting because it characterizes the value of pressure experienced by the average atom or molecule , whereas @xmath2 is interesting because it represents the pressure in the diffuse ( non - self - gravitating ) part of the ism that is closest to star - forming regions .",
    "the mass- and volume- weighted averages are defined by the following : @xmath69 for @xmath68 , all zones in the domain are included , while for @xmath2 , the subscripts @xmath70 and @xmath71 indicate that only zones in the two horizontal planes closest to the midplane are included .",
    "time averaging is applied in all models after the above space averaging .",
    "we also show the same pressure averages for the hydrostatic series ( _ filled box _ and _ filled circle _ ) .",
    "interestingly , in the hydrodynamic models @xmath68 always exceeds @xmath2 by a large factor @xmath72 .",
    "this indicates that self - gravity is important in increasing the pressure above the `` ambient '' value , for much of the gas .",
    "pressures can not exceed the ambient midplane value without horizontal gradients , which are balanced by the gravity within individual clouds ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshot ] ) . in the hydrostatic models , @xmath68 ( _ filled boxes _ ) is generally slightly below @xmath2 ( _ filled circles _ ) , because the pressure at the midplane is the maximum within any system , and weighting by mass includes lower - pressure gas which reduces the average .",
    "( note that for the hydrostatic models , there are no horizontal gradients in any quantities ; see figure [ fig : snapshot ] . ) except in the most active disks , the mass - weighted averages for the hydrostatic models are close to the midplane values for the hydrodynamic models . in figure",
    "[ fig : pressure ] we also display the pressure estimate of br06 ( _ solid line _ ) defined as : @xmath73 where @xmath74 km / s is adopted .",
    "this line falls between @xmath68 and @xmath2 for all the hydrodynamic series .    for hydrostatic series hsp ( shown in the series q and k panels ) , the slope of the midplane pressure is close to",
    "that predicted by equation ( [ pbr_eq ] ) , while being offset to lower @xmath75 by a factor 2 - 3 .",
    "the difference in slope is because the medium has multiple phases , rather than a single phase at a given thermal sound speed .",
    "the offset is because ( i ) much of the mass in the hydrostatic models is at low temperatures , for which the sound speed is well below @xmath76 km / s , and ( ii ) equation ( [ pbr_eq ] ) does not include the gaseous vertical gravity , which is comparable to the stellar gravity when vertical velocity dispersion is low and the disk is very thin ( see below ) .",
    "these effects push @xmath75 in opposite directions , and hence partially compensate each other . for hydrostatic series hsc ( shown in the series r panel ) ,",
    "the prediction of equation ( [ pbr_eq ] ) departs significantly from the slope of the midplane pressure results , because in the hsc series ( which has @xmath77 constant ) vertical gravity is strongly dominated by gas rather than the stellar component at large @xmath6 .    in  [ scale_height ] , we defined an `` average '' vertical equilibrium using the total surface density and the total vertical velocity dispersion , and showed that this could yield an accurate measurement of the disk thickness . the same model ( see appendix ) can be used to estimate a midplane `` effective hydrostatic pressure , '' which we can compare to measured values .",
    "if @xmath66 is the scale height , then in equilibrium the mean midplane gas density is @xmath78 . using the total velocity dispersion ,",
    "the predicted total gas pressure at the midplane is then given by @xmath79 , which using equation ( [ hest_eq ] ) gives @xmath80^{1/2}\\right)\\cr & = & \\sigma \\sigma_z \\sqrt{2 g\\rho_{\\ast } } ( a+\\sqrt{a^2 + 1 } ) .",
    "\\label{eq : pnew}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the expression ( [ eq : pnew ] ) corresponds to an extension of the pressure estimate formula of br06 using the inverse of the @xmath49-dependent correction factor that appears in the scale height estimate ( [ hest_eq ] ) .",
    "this correction factor is @xmath81",
    ".    equation ( [ eq : pnew ] ) gives an estimate of the total midplane pressure , but the thermal pressure should represent only a fraction @xmath82 of @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the mass - weighted rms turbulent velocity dispersion in the vertical direction .",
    "thus , our estimate of the mean thermal pressure at the midplane is @xmath85 in figure [ fig : pressure2 ] , we compare the pressure estimate from equation ( [ eq : pnewth ] ) ( _ filled triangles _ ) with the measurements of midplane pressure . at large @xmath6 , the agreement is quite good , while at low @xmath6 the estimated midplane pressures lie slightly above the measured values .",
    "this behavior is similar to our results for estimated scale heights , which were in best agreement with the measured @xmath47 at large @xmath6 ( where the dense gas dominates the mass , and the velocity dispersion is turbulence - dominated ) .",
    "for all the series in which @xmath6 is the independent variable , we have fit the measured gas pressure to the formula : @xmath86 for @xmath87 and @xmath2 , we find the respective coefficients are @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively .",
    "the largest and smallest surface density models are excluded in the fits .",
    "the results of the fits are displayed as _ solid _ and _ dashed _ lines , respectively , in figure [ fig : pressure2 ] . to compare with the br06 formula",
    ", we also fit @xmath87 and @xmath90 to @xmath91 with @xmath74 km / s .",
    "we find @xmath92 and @xmath93 ; i.e. the br06 formula for pressure yields values that are typically a factor @xmath94 larger than our measured midplane pressures , and a factor @xmath95 below the mass - weighted mean values of pressure .",
    "as noted above , the mass - weighted average pressures are about ten times larger than the midplane pressures ; this is evident in the ratio of the fitting coefficients .",
    "finally , we note that for most models ( except at low @xmath6 ) , the measured midplane pressure exceeds the maximum pressure of the warm neutral medium , @xmath96 for our adopted heating and cooling functions .",
    "dense clouds that are externally confined by the warm medium can not have pressure exceeding @xmath97 unless they are internally stratified ( implying they are self - gravitating ) ; thus , @xmath97 is the largest the midplane pressure could be in the absence of self - gravity . equation ( [ eq : pnewth ] )",
    "can be solved for @xmath6 in terms of the midplane value of @xmath98 . the maximum surface density for an atomic - only disk without self - gravitating clouds is then obtained by setting @xmath99 , with the result @xmath100 times a function of @xmath49 that varies between 0.3 and 0.6 for @xmath101 . assuming @xmath102 and taking @xmath103 , the maximum surface density for a pure - atomic disk is @xmath104",
    "; this is consistent with the saturation levels for hi gas observed e.g. by @xcite .",
    "since the measured midplane pressure is a volume - weighted sum of the pressures in different phases , a mean value exceeding @xmath97 implies that self - gravitating dense clouds occupy a non - negligible fraction of the midplane volume , @xmath105 , with @xmath106 . in the next section",
    ", we turn to a discussion of the relationship between the dense - to - diffuse mass ratio and global parameters .",
    "in this section , we explore relationships between the dense gas fraction and `` environmental '' conditions , including the gas pressure and the gas surface density .",
    "we are motivated by observations that show high molecular fractions in environments  including spiral arms and galactic center regions  where both the total gas surface density and stellar density are high .",
    "in particular , br06 found for a number of disk systems that the mean ratio of molecular - to - atomic mass scales nearly linearly with the pressure estimate @xmath107 defined in equation ( [ pbr_eq ] ) .",
    "although our turbulent , multiphase simulations show that @xmath107 in fact overestimates the pressure of the typical volume element and underestimates the pressure of the typical mass element , @xmath107 nevertheless systematically increases in a similar way to both @xmath2 and @xmath68 .",
    "thus , it is interesting to test how the dense - to - diffuse gas mass ratio depends on the true values of pressure .",
    "in addition to empirical results suggesting a relation between mass ratio and pressure , there are theoretical reasons that the mass ratio should depend on the mean gaseous surface density .",
    "for example , if atomic gas is converted to molecular clouds through gravitational instabilities on a timescale @xmath108 , and molecular clouds are destroyed by star formation on a timescale @xmath109 , equating cloud formation and destruction rates implies @xmath110 , which is @xmath111 if the hi velocity dispersion and cloud destruction time are relatively constant .",
    "thus , it is interesting to explore dependence of @xmath112 on the surface density  which appears in both the effective hydrostatic pressure and the rate of self - gravitating instabilities .",
    "although our numerical model does not directly include formation / dissociation processes of h@xmath29 , we can nevertheless relate our results to observed gas phases in an approximate way , using density as a proxy .",
    "namely , we expect gravitationally bound dense clouds at @xmath113 @xmath114 to consist primarily of h@xmath29 , whereas diffuse gas at lower densities consists primarily of hi .",
    "we argue for this approximate identification based on the formation / dissociation equilibrium condition for @xmath115 molecules , which includes photodissociation and cosmic ray dissociation , and formation on dust grains : @xmath116 @xcite . here , @xmath117 is the molecular fraction , and @xmath118 is the atomic fraction .",
    "the fuv dissociation rate is limited by shielding , which depends on the optical depth in h@xmath29 lines and the extinction .",
    "formation on grains depends on the sticking probability .",
    "the details of the terms involved are listed in table [ tbl : param ] .",
    "we adopt fuv field strength @xmath119 , gas and dust temperature @xmath120 k , and cosmic - ray ionization rate of hydrogen atoms @xmath121s@xmath122 . for any total hydrogen column @xmath123 and volume density @xmath124",
    ", we can solve to obtain @xmath125 , the molecular fraction .",
    "figure [ fig : molecular ] shows , in the @xmath126 plane , the boundary ( _ solid line _ ) between the predominantly - atomic and predominantly - molecular regimes , which we define by the locus of points for which @xmath127 .",
    ".processes and parameters for h@xmath29 formation / dissociation [ cols= \" < , < , < ,",
    "< , < \" , ]     at any density , we can also define the jeans length @xmath128 , where @xmath129 ( we adopt @xmath120k ) .",
    "this defines a corresponding total column of gas , @xmath130 , that could be expected to be gravitationally bound .",
    "the boundary between gravitationally unbound ( low @xmath124 and @xmath131 ) and bound ( high @xmath124 and @xmath131 ) gas , based on this criterion , is shown in figure [ fig : molecular ] as a _ dashed _ line with @xmath132 .",
    "note that if instead of @xmath133 we had chosen as a length scale the diameter @xmath134 of sphere containing mass equal to the bonnor - ebert @xcite critical mass , @xmath135 , then @xmath136 .",
    "this would shift the unbound / bound line in the @xmath137 plane to the left by @xmath138 .",
    "we note that the gravitational binding criterion discussed above considers only support by thermal pressure .",
    "turbulence can lend further support against gravity , and this is particularly important for molecular gas , which is quite cold .",
    "for example , if we considered turbulence - supported clouds with velocity dispersion following the observed linewidth - size relation of galactic gmcs @xcite , then the column density separating gravitationally bound from unbound regions would have a constant value equal to half of the mean observed gmc column , amounting to @xmath139 . a higher normalization for the linewidth - size relation ( as occurs in galactic center regions ; see @xcite ) would further shift the unbound / bound limit to larger @xmath131 . thus , moderate - density molecular gas can in principle be gravitationally unbound under conditions of sufficiently high turbulence @xcite . for our current simulations , however , turbulence levels are not this high ( see discussion below ) .",
    "we have denoted the three different regions in the @xmath137 plane according to their expected chemical and gravitational properties .",
    "the crossing point of the two separation loci is at @xmath140 @xmath114 and @xmath141 ( av @xmath142 0.75 mag ) , with corresponding local jeans length of @xmath143 pc .",
    "this size is in fact slightly larger than the typical resolution limit of our simulations , @xmath144pc ; we show this limit in figure [ fig : molecular ] as a _ dotted _ line , with regions to the right resolved and those to the left below the resolution limit .",
    "the resolution limit crosses the hi / h@xmath29 separation curve at @xmath145 . because the resolution limit falls at larger @xmath131 than the bound / unbound separation nearly everywhere in the molecular domain , all zones at a given density that are resolved and molecular would also be gravitationally bound . in practice",
    ", clouds do not exceed @xmath146 pc in crossection ; we have marked this limit in the figure as a _ dotted _ line .    according to the limits shown in figure [ fig : molecular ] ,",
    "any resolved regions in our simulations at @xmath147 would be molecular .",
    "this is a conservative definition , since it omits some gas between @xmath148 with @xmath149 that could be molecular .",
    "however , gas at these densities could also be in the cold atomic phase ( which extends down to @xmath150 for the cooling curve we adopt ) ; we choose the stricter definition .",
    "we note that when the virial ratio ( @xmath142kinetic / gravitational energy ; see @xcite ) is measured for gas in the range @xmath151 ( most of which is at @xmath152 ) , the values are well above unity  implying that gas parcels in this density range are mostly found in non - self - gravitating regions with low surrounding column densities , to the left of the unbound / bound curve .",
    "this suggests that in practice very little high - column density gas that would be molecular is missed when we set the minimum threshold at @xmath153 . from the point of view of dynamics",
    ", this is because the density rises whenever any region becomes gravitationally bound , so low - density regions at high column are rapidly depopulated .",
    "we also note that the h@xmath29 formation time in dense , cold regions is expected to be short ( @xmath154 years from @xcite ) , because supersonic shocks increase the density above ambient values and accelerate the molecule formation process , which occurs at a rate @xmath155 .      following the discussion in the previous section ,",
    "we adopt a working definition of molecular gas as that at @xmath156 .",
    "atomic gas therefore consists of the lower - density complement , including both what would be observable as warm and as cold hi in 21 cm emission .",
    "the mass ratio of molecular to atomic hydrogen is then defined as @xmath157 where we apply space- and time - averages before taking the ratio .",
    "figure [ fig : h2p ] shows @xmath4 as a function of @xmath158 for all hydrodynamic and hydrostatic series ( we use @xmath159 as in br06 ) .",
    "we also show as a _ solid line _ the empirical fitting formula from the observational study of br06 ( see their eq.13 ) : @xmath160^{0.92}.   \\label{eq : rmol}\\ ] ] interestingly , we find that our results for @xmath4 follow the empirical result for some but not all series .",
    "in particular , the models in series q and r  which have values of @xmath24 that scale with @xmath6 in such a way as to keep the gaseous toomre parameter constant  are close to the br06 fit .",
    "the models in series k , which have constant @xmath5 and therefore high ( or low ) values of @xmath34 where @xmath107 is low ( or high , respectively ) , do not follow the empirical result of br06 , but instead show a ratio @xmath4 that is near unity independent of @xmath107 .",
    "this has two interesting implications .",
    "first , our models with @xmath161 have similar behavior to real galaxies , indicating that real systems evolve ( by converting their gas to stars ) in such a way as to have toomre parameter fall within a limited range of values .",
    "second , because the k series departs from the br06 result , our models suggest that the molecular fraction does not have a one - to - one relationship to the effective pressure parameter @xmath107 .",
    "comparing series q and k which have the same @xmath6 and @xmath8 , @xmath4 increases with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "for example , figure 8 shows that @xmath4 increases by factor 2.4 when @xmath24 ( and @xmath5 ) increases by factor @xmath162 , for the highest-@xmath6 ( @xmath163 ) model . for the @xmath164 model ,",
    "the @xmath4 increase is 60% for an @xmath24 increase by a factor @xmath165 , comparing the q and k series .",
    "series s , which varies @xmath5 at a given value of @xmath6 and @xmath8 , also shows departures from the empirical @xmath4 vs. @xmath107 relation .",
    "given that molecular gas in our models is primarily found in gravitationally - bound systems , it in fact makes sense that the molecular fraction should not have a one - to - one relationship to the parameter @xmath107 , since @xmath107 does not include any effects of galactic rotation . galactic rotation and shear",
    "are crucial for regulating the large - scale gravitational instabilities that create giant molecular clouds in real galaxies as well as in our models , so we believe that the molecular - to - atomic ratio must intrinsically be sensitive to environmental factors that are not captured in @xmath166 .",
    "thus , if observed galaxies _ do _ show a one - to - one relation between @xmath4 and @xmath107 , it implies that the environmental parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath8 are not all independent in real systems .    in figure",
    "[ fig : h2s ] , we show @xmath4 as a function of the surface density for all of our model series .",
    "the behavior is similar to that shown in figure [ fig : h2p ] because @xmath107 depends monotonically on @xmath6 for all our series : @xmath167 for series q and k ( which have @xmath168 ) , while @xmath169 for series r ( which has @xmath170 ) . from both figures figure [ fig : h2p ] and [ fig : h2s ] , it is evident that the hydrostatic models ( _ filled boxes _ ) generally have a much larger molecular component than both the hydrodynamic models and the empirical results , except at low gaseous surface density .",
    "this indicates that turbulence is essential for determining the phase balance between diffuse and dense gas in the ism as a whole . if the ism were a static system , it would be overwhelmingly molecular even at fairly moderate values of @xmath6 and @xmath8 . in real galaxies , turbulence limits",
    "gaseous settling into the midplane and the extreme self - compression that would otherwise ensue .    while we have argued that the molecular content of a galaxy can not ( in general ) be predicted solely from @xmath6 and @xmath8 because self - gravitating horizontal contraction is also responsive to the local rotation and shear rates",
    ", it still is plausible that the molecular fraction should reflect the _ true _ mean pressure in the ism .",
    "if molecular gas is collected in self - gravitating clouds , then since their internal pressure is higher than ambient levels , an increase in the molecular fraction should go hand - in - hand with a higher mass - weighted mean pressure @xmath171 . at the same time , ambient midplane pressures @xmath0 increase when the total gas surface density increases , and ( provided that @xmath5 is low enough ) larger @xmath6 also renders the disk susceptible to gravitational instabilities that would form dense , bound clouds and increase the molecular fraction .",
    "we explore these ideas by plotting in figure [ fig : h2pressure ] the molecular - to - atomic ratio against our two measures of mean gas pressure , @xmath171 and @xmath90 .",
    "we also fit the combined results for all series to single linear relations .",
    "these fits , overplotted in figure [ fig : h2pressure ] as _ solid _ and _ dotted _ lines , are @xmath172 $ ] and @xmath173 $ ] . for series q and r , the fits using @xmath171 are quite good , and the fits using @xmath2 are also fairly good ( series q and r also show better agreement with empirical results than the other series ) . for series",
    "k , the fit using @xmath174 is reasonably close to the models results , but the fit based on @xmath2 fails in a similar manner to that shown in figure ( [ fig : h2p ] ) and discussed above .",
    "the basic reason for this is that the midplane pressure , either directly measured or estimated using equation ( [ eq : pnewth ] ) , increases with increasing @xmath6 .",
    "however , the molecular - to - atomic ratio for series k does not strongly and secularly increase with @xmath6 due to the differences in rotational effects in this constant-@xmath5 series compared to the other series . at high values of @xmath6 in series k , the disk is extremely gravitationally unstable overall , and as a consequence is more active in producing feedback than other models at the same @xmath6 . as a consequence , a smaller fraction of the gas mass ends up being in the dense phase than in series q and r. overall , we conclude that @xmath4 is indeed well correlated with the mass - weighted mean pressure , @xmath171 , as ( almost definitionally ) is expected .",
    "the measured mean midplane pressure , which is more closely related to simple vertical - equilibrium pressure estimates , is less well correlated with @xmath23 when environmental parameters @xmath5 , @xmath8 , and @xmath6 are all independent .",
    "we have used numerical simulations of turbulent , multiphase , self - gravitating gas orbiting in the disks of model galaxies to study the relationships among pressure , the vertical distribution of gas , and the relative proportions of dense and diffuse gas . in particular",
    ", we compare the results on vertical stratification obtained from space - time averages of fully - dynamic  and often turbulence - dominated  systems with simple estimates based on single - component effective hydrostatic equilibria .",
    "we also investigate how vertical - equilibrium estimates for the pressure compare with measured mean values of the pressure in our models .",
    "empirical studies by br06 have identified a linear relation between the molecular - to - atomic mass ratio @xmath4 and a midplane ism pressure estimate , @xmath175 .",
    "we study the origin and implications of this relation by testing the correlations among @xmath4 , @xmath107 , and the directly - measured midplane and mean pressures in our models .",
    "our chief conclusions , and their implications , are as follows :    \\1 . the average disk scale height is well represented by estimates that assume hydrostatic equilibrium and an effective total pressure based on the total ( thermal + turbulent ) vertical velocity dispersion ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : have ] and eq . [ hest_eq ] ) .",
    "thus , provided that gas surface densities , vertical velocity dispersions , and stellar density can be measured , an accurate estimate for the disk thickness can be obtained .",
    "hydrostatic equilibrium with an effective turbulent pressure is commonly assumed in both galactic and extragalactic observational studies ( e.g. ) , but to our knowledge the relations that are generally adopted have not previously been tested with direct numerical simulations .",
    "our hydrodynamic studies demonstrate that for determining the scale height @xmath66 , the effective hydrostatic equilibrium assumption is indeed sufficient , even when turbulent support far exceeds thermal support ( and provided that magnetic effects are sub - dominant ; see below ) .",
    "thus , measured disk thicknesses in edge - on disk galaxies could in principle be used to determine the unobservable vertical velocity dispersion , and measured line - of - sight velocity dispersions in face - on galaxies could be used to determine the unobservable disk thickness .",
    "the basic reason the hydrostatic formula can be used to obtain an accurate measure of @xmath66 is that what is really being equated is the total vertical momentum flux @xmath176 averaged over the midplane , and the total vertical weight of the ism , @xmath177 , averaged over the horizontal direction .",
    "provided that the time - averaged value of the momentum per unit volume in the midplane does not change , momentum conservation including gravitational source terms demands that the difference between vertical momentum flux and vertical weight must be zero , independent of details of the dynamics .",
    "the formula @xmath178 $ ] is therefore fundamentally an expression of momentum conservation .",
    "mass - weighted mean pressures @xmath68 in our hydrodynamic models significantly differ from the mean midplane pressure @xmath2 , while these quantities are quite similar to each other in our static comparison models .",
    "typically , the hydrodynamic models yield values of @xmath179 an order of magnitude larger than @xmath90 .",
    "the difference can be attributed to self - gravitating condensation , which makes concentrated clouds with high internal pressure rather than a horizontally - uniform gas distribution with more moderate pressure .",
    "simple estimates of the pressure based on vertical hydrostatic equilibrium fall between mass - weighted and midplane values , with the formula used by br06 ( see our eq .",
    "[ pbr_eq ] ) comparable to the geometric mean @xmath180 . a single - component estimate for the midplane thermal pressure that accounts for self - gravity and the mean thermal and turbulent velocity dispersions ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : pnewth ] ) follows the measured midplane pressure fairly closely , especially at high @xmath6 .",
    "thus , if turbulent and thermal vertical velocity dispersions can be measured directly ( for face - on galaxies ) , a good estimate of the midplane total or thermal pressure can be computed via equation ( [ eq : pnew ] ) or ( [ eq : pnewth ] ) . for an edge - on system in which the scale height is measured ,",
    "the midplane total or thermal pressure can be estimated as @xmath181 .",
    "midplane pressure estimates based on large - scale observables that assume hydrostatic equilibrium can be quite accurate , but this depends on an accurate measure of the vertical velocity dispersion or vertical thickness .",
    "even if the velocity dispersion is not known , the _ relative _ midplane pressures of different regions within a galaxy ( or from one galaxy to another ) can be obtained using the hydrostatic formulae , provided the variation in the ( unknown ) velocity dispersion within the observational sample is small compared to the variation in the stellar volume and gaseous surface densities .",
    "midplane pressure estimates made in this way should not , however , be treated as a proxy for the pressure in the typical mass element , @xmath179 , which can be much larger than the pressure in the typical volume element .",
    "\\3 . based on calculations of molecular abundance as a function of hydrogen volume density @xmath124 and column density @xmath131 combined with the resolution and measured virial ratios in our simulations",
    ", we adopt a working definition of gas at @xmath182 as `` molecular '' and @xmath183 as `` atomic '' .",
    "we then investigate the ratio @xmath184 for all our models .",
    "we find that series q and r , which have rotation rate @xmath185 , show correlations between @xmath4 and @xmath107 ( or @xmath4 and @xmath6 ) that are similar to the empirical result reported by br06 , @xmath186 .",
    "on the other hand , series k and s , in which @xmath6 and @xmath24 do not vary together , depart from the empirical relation @xmath187 .",
    "we conclude that ( i ) the molecule fraction inherently depends on the rotational state of a galactic disk , not just on the local values of the stellar volume and gaseous surface densities @xmath8 and @xmath6 ; and ( ii ) the empirical relation @xmath188 identified by br06 implies that the third `` environmental parameter , '' the epicyclic frequency @xmath189 ( assuming a flat rotation curve ) , is not independent of @xmath8 and @xmath6 in real galaxies .",
    "this dependence can be accomplished by evolution : for example , disk galaxies may convert gas into stars until they reach a state in which the toomre parameter @xmath190 approaches a critical value .",
    "we have tested the correlation between @xmath4 and the measured pressures in our models , @xmath191 and @xmath192 , and find a good correlation in all series only for the latter .",
    "the correlation between @xmath193 and @xmath4 is potentially useful as a way to estimate the typical internal pressure within gravitationally - bound regions when only the total molecular - to - atomic mass is easily accessible , as for low - resolution observations .",
    "this internal pressure is important in the small - scale aspects of star formation such as determining the imf , as well as in molecular chemistry .",
    "the lack of correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath191 in series k implies that the molecular content can not in general be predicted solely from @xmath6 and @xmath8 ( i.e. without knowledge of @xmath5 ) , as noted above .",
    "this reflects the fact that the formation of self - gravitating clouds is regulated not just by gravitational processes and pressure , but also by angular momentum .",
    "\\5 . for our non - turbulent comparison models , we find that @xmath194 far exceeds observed values .",
    "this indicates that turbulence is essential to setting the observed phase balance in the ism .",
    "recent theoretical investigations of the origin of kennicutt - schmidt laws have focused on the dependence of star formation rates on the molecular , rather than total , gas surface density ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "since turbulence is crucial in determining the abundance of dense gas , in simulations that aim to compute this abundance realistically it is necessary to incorporate the feedback effects that drive turbulence , and to run on a fine enough mesh ( or with sufficient sph particles ) that the turbulence is well resolved . while technically challenging in global disk models ,",
    "local models may offer a more immediate route to this goal .",
    "_ caveats  _ the models analyzed in this paper are subject to a number of limitations , which could potentially affect some of our conclusions",
    ". the chief limitations of the simulations are",
    "that ( i ) they are two - dimensional , representing cuts in the @xmath26 plane , rather than three - dimensional ; ( ii ) we have adopted a very simple model to implement turbulent driving as a star formation feedback effect from hii regions , and we have not included other drivers of turbulence such as supernovae , spiral shocks , and shear instabilities ; ( iii ) we have not included magnetic fields ( or cosmic rays ) .",
    "we intend to pursue these extensions in future work .",
    "inclusion of magnetic fields and altered turbulent driving would certainly affect the specific quantitative findings for @xmath47 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 , and @xmath4 in our models .",
    "we believe , however , that the results we have emphasized regarding physical _ relationships _ are robust .",
    "in particular , with appropriate modifications to include magnetic stresses , the time - averaged vertical momentum flux through the midplane must still equal the time - averaged vertical weight if the mean vertical momentum is conserved .",
    "this can be used to predict the total midplane pressure ( including the magnetic pressure ) and @xmath66 given the values of @xmath6 , @xmath8 , and the thermal , turbulent , and alfvn velocities .",
    "thus , we anticipate that inclusion of magnetic fields and alternate turbulence sources would not fundamentally alter the conclusion that reasonable estimates of scale heights can be made using observable quantities even in highly - dynamic systems .",
    "further , we expect that our conclusions regarding the presence or absence of correlations between @xmath4 and @xmath193 or @xmath191 would continue to hold in models that include additional turbulence sources and magnetic fields , although the details of correlations might change .",
    "namely , angular momentum inherently must be important in permitting or preventing formation of dense , self - gravitating clouds .",
    "our present models account for angular momentum effects , and show that @xmath23 does not in general have a one - to - one relationship with @xmath195 or @xmath196 ; we expect this result would carry over into any model that incorporates sheared background rotation of the galactic disk .",
    "thus , if a one - to - one relationship between @xmath4 and @xmath196 indeed exists empirically , it implies that @xmath6 , @xmath8 , and @xmath5 are not all independent quantities in real galaxies .",

    "<S> finally , we note that @xmath4 in static comparison models far exceeds both the values in our turbulent hydrodynamic simulations and observed values of @xmath4 , when @xmath11 , indicating that incorporation of turbulence is crucial to obtaining a realistic molecular fraction in numerical models of the ism . </S>"
