    "molecular spintronics is at the convergence of two recent and rapidly developping fields . on the one hand ,",

    "@xcite on the other hand , spintronics , where the focus is placed on the electronic spin as a new useful degree of freedom .",
    "magnetic molecules - molecules having an intrinsic spin , possibly large @xcite - play , of course , an important role in molecular spintronics .",
    "several transport experiments have been performed in the past years on such magnetic molecules - specially on molecular magnets like @xmath3 derivatives , which are molecules with a large spin anisotropy , tending to align the spin along an easy - axis .",
    "@xcite theoretical calculations on transport in the incoherent regime for these molecules have been done , specially in the case where the electrodes have magnetic properties .",
    "@xcite other magnetic molecules are spin isotropic , and some work has been done already to study electronic transport with such spin - isotropic magnetic molecule .",
    "@xcite in ref .",
    "[ ] , the full counting statistics ( fcs ) for such a molecule placed between non - magnetic electrodes has been obtained . however , to the best of our knowledge , no work has been devoted to the electronic transport between ferromagnetic electrodes through a spin - isotropic magnetic molecule ; one of the aims of this paper to study this problem .",
    "experimentaly , transport through such a spin - isotropic magnetic molecule can be obtained for example with a magnetic atom trapped inside a @xmath4 molecule , which is placed between two electrodes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : levels]).@xcite    this paper focuses on the transport through a spin - isotropic magnetic molecule , in the regime of weak coupling to the leads . the primary goal is to compute the current , its zero - frequency fluctuations and more importantly to analyze the fluctuations of the total spin on the molecule .",
    "this is an important issue because of the mutual influence between the electronic current passing through the molecule and the molecular spin .",
    "we consider ferromagnetic electrodes with collinear alignments of electrodes ( parallel or anti - parallel , or situation with only one polarized electrode).@xcite the system displays a rich variety of behaviors : on the one hand the suppression of the current by spin - blockade and , on the other hand , unusually large fluctuations of the molecular spin .",
    "we are considering the temperature regime in which successive tunneling events through the dot are all incoherent ( incoherent tunneling regime ) , and describe them as a markovian process .",
    "such a situation is realized at a temperature @xmath5 which is much higher than the typical energy scale determined by @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath7 .",
    "we model the molecule as a quantum dot with a single resonant level , with infinite coulomb repulsion ( no double occupancy ) .",
    "the molecular spin @xmath8 , and the electronic spin on the dot level @xmath9 , interact through an exchange interaction , @xmath10 .",
    "the dot level is , therefore , split into two levels , corresponding to two eigenvalues of the total angular momentum , @xmath11 . for simplicity",
    ", we will work at temperatures much smaller than the applied bias voltage , at which electron transport happens _ only in one direction _ , and the bias window is infinitely sharp .",
    "@xcite we also choose the chemical potentials of the electrodes such that only the @xmath12 spin sector is in the bias window , and only states in this energy level take part in the transport ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : levels ] ) .",
    "the basic mechanism at work here is the exchange of spin between the itinerant electrons and the molecule : an incident spin - up electron , for example , can be collected as a spin - down electron ( spin - flip ) , if the molecular spin has its polarization along the reference axis increased by one .",
    "magnetic electrodes , with different densities of states for spin up / down electrons , leading to spin - depedent tunneling rates : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , can thus induce polarization of the molecular spin ( @xmath15 $ ] is the polarization of the @xmath16 electrode , and @xmath17 is the tunneling rate to the @xmath16 electrode ) .",
    "the standard method in the incoherent tunneling regime is to use master equations .",
    "this approach has been successfully implemented to compute numerically the current and the noise through such molecular systems.@xcite recently , analytical results were obtained for the full counting statistics in the case of non - magnetic electrodes.@xcite we use here an alternative method which allow us to obtain _ analytical formulas _ for the case of magnetic electrodes , for the current @xmath18 , the charge @xmath19 , the total spin @xmath1 and the fluctuations of these quantities .",
    "this method has been introduced by korotkov , for computing numerically fluctuations in the single - electron transistor .",
    "@xcite it uses a langevin approach , where the transport process is seen as random sequential jumps between neighbouring system states .",
    "we have extended this method , in order to obtain analytical results for the present problem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present a concise but self - contained explanation of the method . section iii presents and discusses the results we have obtained in the case of a molecular spin @xmath20 , for the mean current and its fluctuations , and for the @xmath2 component of the total spin @xmath1 and its fluctuations .",
    "section iv discusses how the results are modified in the case of higher spins .",
    "another method of calculation which can be used to obtain the same analytical results is shortly explained in section v , and section vi gives the conclusion .",
    "a few appendices contain some lengthy formulas , and analytical results for molecular spin @xmath21 .     and",
    "the electron spin , the occupied dot level is split between the @xmath22 levels ( with @xmath1 ranging from @xmath23 to @xmath24 ) and the @xmath25 levels ( with @xmath1 ranging from @xmath26 to @xmath27 ) , with a spliting @xmath28 .",
    "we chose the chemical potential of the electrodes such that the @xmath25 levels only are in the bias window .",

    "we give a short self - contained derivation of the method , only stressing the points which are different from the original work.@xcite      the time evolution is divided in terms of segments : a segment @xmath29 is defined as a series of random processes which begins with a reference state and finishes with the same state .",
    "this reference state is arbitrary , and all the physical quantities are of course independent of the choice of this state . as the time evolution is given by a markovian series of random transitions , two different segments are totally independent , and any time integral used to compute average or fluctuations can be written in terms of average over the segments . in our model , a state @xmath30 can be characterized by the occupation number of the dot level @xmath19 , the total angular momentum @xmath31 and its @xmath2-component@xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath32 .",

    "we have chosen equal bare transition rates for the left and right electrodes , @xmath144 ( formulas with general transition rates can be obtained easily with the same method ) . as can be seen on the table ,",

    "[ fig : i12 ] .",
    "the simplest case is the case of parallel polarizations ( p , dotted curve ) : the mean current is then constant ( value 3/10 ) , and the polarization of the leads has thus no effect .",
    "note that the fact that the current is constant is related to the choice we made for the density of states @xmath146 ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "indeed , we see that the total densitiy of states ( spin up + spin down ) in each electrode is constant .",
    "consider next the anti - parallel case ( ap ) .",
    "we see ( full curve on fig .",
    "[ fig : i12 ] ) that the mean current has a maximum for zero polarization , and decreases to zero when @xmath133 approaches @xmath148 .",
    "this behavior can be understood simply : when @xmath149 is large ( let us take for example @xmath133 close to 1 ) , the electrons coming from the left electrode have preferentially a spin up , while the electrons going to the right electrode have preferentially a spin down ; the transport of such an electron from the left to the right electrode implies thus a flip of the electron spin , and thus an increase of 1 of the @xmath2 component of the molecular spin . however , this will lead quickly to a maximally polarized molecular spin , for which such a spin exchange will be impossible .",
    "the only processes contributing to transport will then involve the electrons with a low density of state ( spin down in the left lead or spin up in the right one ) , for which the current goes to 0 when @xmath149 goes to 1 .",
    "this behavior is a case of _ spin blockade _ : for @xmath150 , an electron is blocked on the dot because its spin does not fit the collecting electrode spin .",
    "the case where the right electrode only is polarized ( rp , dash - dotted curve on fig .",
    "[ fig : i12 ] ) is similar . for @xmath151 ,",
    "the system reaches a state where the @xmath2 component of the molecular spin is maximally negative ( @xmath152 for the empty dot ) . in this state , spin - up",
    "electron can tunnel from the left electrode to the right electrode without any splin - flip , but as soon as a spin - down electron is tunneling from the left electrode , it is blocked on the dot because it can not flip to a spin - up electron and tunnel to the right electrode . because of the very large coulomb repulsion on the molecular level , the presence of this spin - down electron forbids any further transport of spin - up electron .",
    "this case is thus also a case of spin blockade , as in the ap case , but the coulomb repulsion on the molecular level plays here a central role .",
    "the decrease of the mean current with @xmath133 is a bit slower than in the ap case , as the process where an electron tunnel without any spin flip , and without involving small densities of states , is always possible when @xmath153 .",
    "finally , the case where the left electrode only is polarized ( lp , dashed curve on fig .",
    "[ fig : i12 ] ) has a totally different behavior . there",
    ", the current is slowly increasing when @xmath149 increases , and there is no spin blockade . indeed , as the density of states of both spins are important in the right electrode , it is always possible to have transport of an electron without spin flip , and involving large densitites of states .",
    "let us now consider the zero - frequency current fluctuations , shown on the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : i12 ] .",
    "again , we observe very different behavior for the four different cases of electrode polarizations . at @xmath154 ,",
    "the value of @xmath137 is @xmath155 . in the parallel case ( p , dotted curve ) ,",
    "@xmath137 increases with @xmath133 , and diverges as @xmath156 as @xmath149 approaches 1 ( see the inset in the figure ) .",
    "on the other hand , in the anti - parallel case ( ap , full curve ) , the current fluctuations are nearly maximal at @xmath154 ( with small shoulders near @xmath157 ) , and decrease to 0 as @xmath158 .",
    "this huge difference in behavior can be understood using the segment picture ; let us take for example @xmath133 close to 1 . in the parallel case , the most probable process contributing to transport is simply the transport of one spin - up electron , without any spin flip , and thus without exchanging angular momentum with the molecular spin .",
    "the most probable segment is thus a very short one , with a single electron transfered .",
    "however , an exchange of angular momentum ( spin flip for the electron , and modification of the @xmath2 component of the molecular spin ) can happen with a small probability ; when this happen , the system will then transfer again a very large number of electrons without any spin flip , and it will take a very long time before the @xmath2 component of the molecular spin recover its inital value .",
    "there is thus a small probability to have a very long segment , with many electrons transfered - the smaller the probability , the longer the segment .",
    "this presence of rare but arbitrary long segment when @xmath133 goes to 1 , in a `` background '' of very short segments , explains the divergence of @xmath137 in the parallel case .",
    "the situation is different for the anti - parallel case : for @xmath133 close to 1 , the molecular spin is with a high probability in a maximaly polarized state ( @xmath159 for the empty dot ) .",
    "the most probable process is again the transfer of a single electron without spin flip ( this produces a low current as it involves a small density of state in one of the electrodes ) .",
    "there is again a small probability of a spin - flip , which will bring the molecular spin in the state @xmath160 .",
    "however , at this point , the most probable process ( involving large densities of state in both electrodes ) tends to bring the molecular spin back to the @xmath159 state .",
    "the resulting segment is thus also short , with 2 ( or at most a few ) electrons tranferred . as this probability for such longer segments goes to zero when @xmath161 , and as the length of these segments is quite short ,",
    "we understand why the current fluctuations @xmath137 go to 0 when @xmath158 .    in the case",
    "where the right electrode only is polarized ( rp , dash - dotted curve ) , the current fluctuations also go to 0 as @xmath158 .",
    "note however the presence of broad shoulders , with a maximum of the fluctuations near @xmath162 . finally , in the case",
    "where the left electrode only is polarized ( lp , dashed curve ) , the fluctuations have a behavior similar to the one of the mean current , with a slow increase when @xmath149 increases .",
    "in many works about electronic transport in the incoherent regime , the emphasis is put on the statistics of the electronic current , and little attention is given to the statistics of other quantities ( see however ref . [ ] ) . here",
    "we study the statistics of the total spin of the molecule ( i.e. its @xmath2 component @xmath1 ) , which gives us precious information on the impact of the electronic current on the molecular spin .    the results for the mean value of the @xmath2 component of the molecular spin , @xmath140 , and the @xmath1 fluctuations @xmath141 , are shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : jz12 ] . note that these two quantities involve both the molecular spin when the dot is full ( @xmath1 ) and the molecular spin for the empty dot ( which is noted @xmath98 , but as the intrinsic molecular spin @xmath0 is also the total spin for an empty dot , @xmath1 reduces to @xmath98 for an empty dot ) .",
    "the mean value @xmath140 is an important quantity , as it shows how the current through the molecule is changing the polarization of its spin ( as without any current , one has simply @xmath164 ) .",
    "the fluctuations @xmath141 show how the molecular spin fluctuates around its mean value , it gives thus precious information on how precisely one could control the molecular spin polarization by applying a current .    in the parallel case ( p , dotted curve on the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : jz12 ] ) , the mean value @xmath140 is simply 0 for all @xmath133 . in the anti - parallel case ( ap , full curve )",
    ", @xmath140 is an non - linear odd function of @xmath133 , going from 0 to 1 for @xmath133 going from 0 to 1 .",
    "this behavior is easily understood . for @xmath165 for example , the spin - up electrons have a larger density of state than spin - down electrons in the left electrode , and it is the opposite in the right electrode .",
    "the system thus favors the transport of a spin - up electron from the left electrode into a spin - down electron in the right electrode ( compared to the process with the spins exchanged ) , and this process increase @xmath1 by 1 . on average",
    "@xmath140 will thus be positive for @xmath166 . for @xmath151",
    ", we have seen that current is 0 because of spin blockade . in this case , the system is frozen in the state where the dot is full , with @xmath167 , hence one has @xmath168 .",
    "the behavior is quite similar in the case where the left electrode only is polarized ( lp , dashed curve ) : @xmath140 is an odd function of @xmath133 , positive for @xmath166 .",
    "there are two main differences with the anti - parallel case .",
    "first , the slope at @xmath154 is smaller ( it is 1 for lp , and 2 for ap ) .",
    "next , @xmath140 does not reach 1 ( but 5/6 ) for @xmath151 .",
    "this is because the current is non - zero even for @xmath151 ( no spin - blockade ) , and thus the molecular spin oscillates from the value @xmath167 ( filled dot ) and @xmath169 ( empty dot ) .",
    "finally , the case where the right electrode only is polarized ( rp , dahs - dotted curve ) has an opposite sign , and the behaviour is simply linear , with @xmath170 .",
    "the fact that the sign is the opposite from the sign of the other cases ( @xmath171 for @xmath151 ) is due to the fact the tunneling of a spin - up electron to the right electrode ( dominant for @xmath166 ) is done either without spin flip ( if the electron coming from the left electrode is also a spin - up electron ) , or with a spin - flip which decreases @xmath1 by 1 ( if the electron coming from the left electrode is a spin - down electron ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath140 reaches the value @xmath172 for @xmath151 is again due to spin blockade , as in the anti - parallel case .",
    "let us now consider the fluctuations of @xmath1 around its mean value , @xmath141 ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : jz12 ] ) .",
    "note first that the value of @xmath141 for @xmath154 is @xmath173 .",
    "this value , which determines the overall scale of the fluctuations , is extremely large , and is discussed in more details below . in the parallel case ( p )",
    ", @xmath141 is increasing as @xmath149 increases , and has the same @xmath156 divergence as the current noise ( for the same reasons ) . in the other three cases ,",
    "@xmath141 is maximum at @xmath154 , and decreases as @xmath149 increases , with a much broader shapes for the cases with only one electrode polarized ( lp and rp ) compared to the anti - parallel case ( ap ) . in the anti - parallel case , and in the case where the right electrode only is polarized ( rp )",
    ", @xmath141 is 0 for @xmath174 , because of spin - blockade ( current is zero ) .",
    "but in the case where the left electrode only is polarized ( lp ) , @xmath175 for @xmath174 because there is no - spin blockade : for @xmath151 the molecular spin oscillates between the values @xmath169 and @xmath167 , leading to these non - zero fluctuations .",
    "finally , we note that the behavior of @xmath141 is very similar in the two cases where there is only one electrode polarized ( lp and rp ) ; this is quite remarkable , as the currents ( and the current noises ) in these two cases have a completely different behavior ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : i12 ] ) .",
    "as said above , the scale of these @xmath1 fluctuations is very large , with a value @xmath176 for @xmath154 .",
    "a natural normalization of these fluctuations , to take into account the value of the molecular spin , is to divide by @xmath177 ( note that @xmath178 ) .",
    "here , @xmath20 , which gives a normalized value of @xmath179 .",
    "this value has the dimension of a time , and should be compared with a typical time in the system . here",
    ", the natural time is just the inverse transtion rate @xmath180 , which gives the scale of the time to transfer an electron .",
    "the value of the @xmath1 fluctuations at @xmath154 is quite larger than this time scale .",
    "comparison with the value for the charge fluctuations @xmath139 , which is @xmath181 ( see table  [ table : ana12 ] ) shows also that the normalized @xmath1 fluctuations for @xmath154 are extremey large .",
    "even if these fluctuations decrease with increasing @xmath149 ( except in the parallel case ) , they remain quite large when @xmath149 is not close to 1 .",
    "one can thus speak of _ colossal spin fluctuations _ , and this implies that it is difficult to control the molecular spin with the current , except with electrodes having polarizations @xmath133 close to 1 .    in this respect ,",
    "the anti - parallel case is much more favourable than the case where only one electrode is polarized .",
    "one could for example think to use a setup with only one polarized electrode , to flip the molecular spin by reversing the current in the setup .",
    "indeed , reversing the voltage bias will make the system go from the lp case to the rp case . if @xmath182 for the polarized electrode , we see on the left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : jz12 ] that @xmath140 would change from approximatively @xmath183 ( case lp ) to @xmath184 ( case rp ) when the bias voltage is reversed .",
    "however , as the @xmath1 fluctuations are very large ( the normalized value is @xmath185 ) , it is difficult to say that the molecular spin is _",
    "controlled_. performing the same with two polarized electrodes in the anti - parallel polarization configuration would be more effective : reversing the bias voltage is then equivalent to the change @xmath186 , and with @xmath182 it would change @xmath187 from approximatively @xmath188 to @xmath189 .",
    "the normalized value of the @xmath1 fluctuations is then approximatively @xmath190 , which is much lower than in the previous case .",
    "in the previous section , we have shown the results obtained in the case of a molecular spin @xmath20 .",
    "the method we have presented is of course not limited to this value of the spin , and we discuss in this section how the results are changed when the molecular spin is larger than @xmath191 . note that the analytical results for @xmath21 are given in table  [ table : ana1e ] , in appendix  [ app : tableana1 ] .",
    "the plots one obtains with these results are qualitatively similar to the ones for @xmath20 .    in order to discuss the behavior at larger @xmath0",
    ", one should distinguish between the mean current ( and the current fluctuations ) on the one hand , and the mean value of @xmath1 ( and the @xmath1 fluctuations ) on the other hand .",
    "for the mean current , and the current fluctuations , there is very little change as one increases the spin , and the physical explanations we have given for @xmath20 apply for arbitrary spin .",
    "this is illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : ilarges ] , which shows the mean current @xmath136 ( left panel ) and the current fluctuations @xmath137 ( right panel ) as a function of the polarization @xmath133 , for the anti - parallel ( ap ) configuration , and for the values of the spin @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath192 .",
    "one can see that both the mean current and the current fluctuations decrease a little bit as the spin is increased , with very little change in the @xmath133 dependence . for larger values of @xmath0 , the curves will slowly converge towards a `` classical curve '' , obtained by considering a classical ( fixed ) spin .",
    "the situation for the mean of @xmath1 and its fluctuations is slightly different . first",
    ", as @xmath12 , it is natural to normalize the results for the different @xmath0 to compare them ; we normalize @xmath140 by @xmath193 , and the @xmath1 fluctuations by @xmath177 .",
    "the normalized mean of @xmath1 is shown on the left panel of fig  [ fig : jzlarges ] , for the case of anti - parallel polarizations ( ap ) , and for the values of the spin @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath192 . when @xmath161 , the molecular spin is maximaly polarized , and thus each curve reaches the value 1 for @xmath151 .",
    "however , the slope at @xmath154 increases when @xmath0 increases . by inspection of the formulas",
    ", we see that the slope at @xmath154 is given by @xmath194 .",
    "the molecular spin is thus more easily polarized when @xmath0 increases .",
    "when the molecular spin becomes large , we expect that it becomes more sensitive to the electrodes magnetizations , reaching even for small @xmath149 highly polarized states .",
    "the @xmath1 fluctuations , @xmath141 , normalized by @xmath177 , are shown on the right panel of fig  [ fig : jzlarges ] .",
    "two important characteristics appear on this figure .",
    "first , the maximum value of the normalized fluctuations , for @xmath154 , increase strongly when @xmath0 increase .",
    "this maximum is already very large for @xmath20 ( see the discussion in the previous section ) , but it is still much larger for larger @xmath0 . at @xmath154 , @xmath195 for @xmath20 , @xmath196 for @xmath21 , and @xmath197 for @xmath192 , @xmath198 .",
    "secondly , the width of the curves as a function of @xmath133 decreases as @xmath0 increases : the full width at half maximum is @xmath199 for @xmath20 , @xmath200 for s=1 and @xmath201 for @xmath192 .",
    "this means that for @xmath149 large enough , the normalized fluctuations decrease when @xmath0 is increased .",
    "for example , on the figure , we see that for @xmath202 , the normalized @xmath1 fluctuations for @xmath192 are smaller than those for @xmath20 .",
    "we expect this tendency to continue when @xmath0 is increased , with the normalized @xmath1 fluctuations for a large spin @xmath0 having the shape of a narrow peak with a very large maximum value .",
    "as soon as the electrodes have some magnetization , a larger spin is thus relatively easier to control than a small spin @xmath0 , as the normalized @xmath1 fluctuations can be much smaller .",
    "we discuss here shorlty another method of calculation , which can also be used to obtain analytical formulas for the averages and fluctuations of different quantities , and which can even give access to analytic expression for the higher moments .",
    "it is derived from the master equation approach to the full counting statistics , which was introduced in ref .",
    "[ ] , and adapted for a molecular quantum dot magnet ( placed between normal electrodes ) in ref .",
    "[ ] . a full explanation of the method can be found in these two references .    in the master equation approach ,",
    "a @xmath203 matrix @xmath204 determines the time evolution of the populations of the @xmath62 different states of the system : @xmath205 where @xmath206 is the vector containing the populations .",
    "any off - diagonal element @xmath207 of the matrix @xmath204 gives the transition probability from state @xmath208 to state @xmath209 . to obtain the full counting statistics of a given physical quantity , a counting field @xmath210",
    "is introduced in the matrix @xmath204 , by making the appropriate replacements of diagonal and non - diagonal elements .",
    "the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath211 then give access to the full counting statistics , as the cumulant generating function is simply proportionnal to the eigenvalue @xmath212 which satisfies @xmath213 .",
    "the full counting statistics is thus obtained by solving the equation : @xmath214 where the functions @xmath215 ( @xmath216 ) depend on the matrix @xmath204 modified by the counting field @xmath210 .",
    "the solution @xmath212 which satisfies @xmath217 then gives access to the cumulants @xmath218 of the quantity @xmath46 associated with the counting field @xmath210 : @xmath219 note that the first two cumulants ( @xmath220 and @xmath221 ) are simply the average and the fluctuations which have been calculated in the previous sections .",
    "in general , the cumulant of order @xmath62 can be expressed as a combination of the centered moments of order @xmath222.@xcite @xmath45 is the measuring time , which must be larger than all typical times in the system .",

    "with this alternative method , we have computed all the quantities shown in the previous sections of this article , and we verified that we could indeed recover the same formulas .",
    "this method allow to compute quite easily cumulants of order higher than 2 .",

    "in this paper , we have studied the incoherent transport between ferromagnetic electrodes through a magnetic molecule with an isotropic spin .",
    "the molecule is modeled as a single resonant level , with large electronic interaction forbidding double occupancy of the level .",
    "there is an exchange coupling between the molecular spin and the electronic spin on the molecular level . by extending an original method ( which was first introduced by korotkov in the study of noise of the singe - electron transistor  @xcite )",
    ", we have shown that it is possible to obtain analytical formulas for the average and fluctuations of all physical quantities of interest .",
    "the idea of the method is to separate the transport process in statistically independent segments , and to compute the average and fluctutations using the properties of individual segments and then averaging using the statistical distribution of all segments .",
    "we have focused on the current through the molecule and its fluctuations , and on the total spin of the molecule and its fluctuations .",
    "we limited the calculations to the case of a temperature @xmath5 much smaller than the bias voltage , and with only the level @xmath12 in the bias window , but using the same method it would be quite easy to generalize the results to higher temperatures , or to the case where the two levels @xmath88 are inside the bias window .    by considering several configurations of the magnetization of the electrodes ( both electrodes polarized with parallel or anti - parallel polarizations , or only one electrode polarized ) , we have shown that there is a rich variety of behaviors .",
    "depending on the electrode polarizations , the current can decrease or increase with the electrodes polarization ; for maximally polarized electrodes , it can be blocked due to spin blockade .",
    "the current fluctuations can show a non - monotonic behavior as polarization is increased .    with the study of @xmath1 ( the @xmath2 component of the total spin of the molecule )",
    ", we have been able to characterize how the electronic transport affects the molecular spin .",
    "if the results for the average of @xmath1 show , as expected , that it is possible to polarize the molecular spin by using magnetic electrodes ( non - zero average of @xmath1 whose sign depends on the sign of the current ) , the results for the fluctuations of @xmath1 show that these fluctuations are very large .",
    "this shows that it is effectively difficult to control the molecular spin with the current , except with electrodes having polarizations close enough to 1 .",
    "we have shown how these results evolve when increasing the bare molecular spin : the polarizability of the molecular spin increases near @xmath154 , and the fluctuations of @xmath1 are more peaked around @xmath154 .",
    "these large fluctuations of the molecular spin are of course a direct consequence of the isotropy of the molecular spin .",
    "the fluctuations would be severly reduced in molecular magnets , where a strong spin - anisotropy is present .",
    "we have also shown that we can obtain the same results using a different calculation , based on an extension of the method introduced by bagrets and nazarov  @xcite to compute the full counting statitics in coulomb blockade systems .",
    "in contrast to the segment method , this second method offers the possibility to compute the higher cumulants of the physical quantities , and we have shown as an example the results for the third and fourth cumulant of the electronic current .",
