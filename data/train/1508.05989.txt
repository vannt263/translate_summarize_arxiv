    "analyses of fermi - lat data by several groups have identified an emission of diffuse gamma rays distributed nearly spherically - symmetric about the galactic center , i.e. the galactic center excess ( gce )  @xcite ,  @xcite ( ccw ) .",
    "the gce is statistically significant , though its precise morphology and energy spectrum is still subject to systematic uncertainties that derive from the model fits .",
    "millisecond pulsars  @xcite , young pulsars  @xcite , and more generally a population of point source below the fermi - lat threshold  @xcite have been fit to the gce .",
    "other astrophysical sources such as cosmic ray protons  @xcite and inverse compton emission from high energy electrons  @xcite arising from burst - like events have also been discussed in the context of the gce .    a dark matter ( dm )",
    "annihilation explanation of the gce has generated considerable excitement  @xcite . in itself",
    ", there are a couple of challenges one must confront when attempting to connect the gce to a possible dm signal .",
    "first , the aforementioned emission from unresolved point sources and diffuse emission process are difficult to predict theoretically , which implies that the data itself is often used to understand the gamma ray emission from these sources .",
    "second , there is considerable freedom in dm interpretations of the excess , in that a wide range of masses and cross sections are able to fit the data .    with these points in mind , studies of other sources for a corroborating dm signal",
    "are especially important .",
    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) of the milky way are quintessential target for indirect dm searches  @xcite , and provide an independent cross check on a possible dm signal hinted at near the galactic center . indeed the lack of excess gamma - ray signal from dsphs imposes constraints on dm annihilation cross - section  @xcite , and also strongly constrains dm interpretations of the gce for a variety of different annihilation channels with 2 body final states .    in this paper",
    "we explore dm particle models that annihilate to a pair of on - shell scalar mediators which subsequently decay into @xmath0-quarks and @xmath1 leptons , and explore their compatibility with gce and dsph gamma ray observations .",
    "annihilation to 4-body final states have been considered within the context of earlier fermi - lat dsph observations and earlier analyses of the gce  @xcite . in comparison to these previous papers ,",
    "the goal of the paper is two - fold .",
    "first we revisit the annihilation of dm into higgs - like scalars , taking into account correlated systematic uncertainties derived by ccw .",
    "we then constrain the model parameter space using the new fermi - lat dsph pass-8 results  @xcite .",
    "a similar study , prior to recent pass-8 results , has been performed in the context of the nmssm  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in this paper we fit the gce in @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 channels in both a model - independent way and within the framework of a realistic @xmath5 model incorporating all of the aforementioned decay channels .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ setup ]",
    "we discuss our fits to the galactic center emission and the framework for the statistical analysis . in section  [ dsphs ]",
    ", we interpret the new dsph constraints in the context of our analysis . in section  [ results ]",
    "we present the results of our model - independent study . in section  [ model ] we describe the motivation and particle content of the @xmath5 model along with its possible realization in the context of gce phenomenology .",
    "finally we conclude in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "the direct production of hard photons from dm annihilation is typically loop suppressed  @xcite , so that photons produced are from decays of standard model ( sm ) particles . here",
    "we consider the dm particle , @xmath6 , annihilating to a pair of beyond standard model ( bsm ) scalar , @xmath7 , which in turn decays to various sm quarks and leptons .",
    "the continuous spectrum of gamma - rays arises from light mesons , produced via hadronization and/or decay of sm fermions .",
    "the gamma - ray differential flux from dm annihilation over a solid angle @xmath8 is given by , @xmath9 where the sum is extended over all annihilation channels into fermionic final states @xmath10 .",
    "the first term depends on particle physics properties - @xmath11 is the thermally averaged total cross section , @xmath12 is the dm mass , and @xmath13 is the prompt photon spectrum per annihilation into final state @xmath10 . the second term , known as the astrophysical j - factor , is obtained from the line of sight ( l.o.s ) integration over dm halo profile , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , with @xmath16 kpc and @xmath17 being the angle from the galactic center . to provide the most straightforward comparison to previous results we utilize the generalized navarro - frenk - white ( gnfw ) profile for the dm distribution  @xcite @xmath18 the scale radius @xmath19 , is chosen to be 20 kpc , and the scale density @xmath20 is determined by fixing the local dm density at the solar radius , @xmath21 gev/@xmath22  @xcite . for a dm interpretation of the gce ,",
    "the best fit is @xmath23  @xcite over a region of interest ( roi ) @xmath24 and @xmath25 . for these assumptions the averaged j - factor over the roi , @xmath26 ,",
    "is found to be @xmath27 gev@xmath28@xmath29sr@xmath30 .",
    "to fit to the gce , we use the results of ccw , who go into detail exploring multiple galactic diffuse emission ( gde ) models .",
    "the aforementioned analysis has been implemented by generating the prompt photon spectra using  @xcite and we verified that our results agree with  @xcite for @xmath31 and @xmath32 final states .",
    "next we have performed a global fit using a @xmath33 statistic defined by , @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the predicted and observed flux in the @xmath37-th energy bin and @xmath38 is the covariance matrix containing statistical and correlated systematic errors .",
    "ccw have estimated the uncertainties of the gce by studying 60 gde models and also studied the correlation in the spectrum along the galactic disc .",
    "ccw extract the residual signal and a set of systematic uncertainties , which dominates over the energy range of our interest and has high degree of correlation across energy bins . the effect of these systematic uncertainties are included in our analysis by means of the publicly available covariance matrix , @xmath38  @xcite .",
    "from a combined sample of 15 dsphs , fermi - lat has presented the upper bounds on @xmath11 in standard sm annihilation channels [ @xmath39 based on six years of data  @xcite .",
    "these results have improved the cross section constraints derived from previous combined samples  @xcite .",
    "our goal is to use these bounds to estimate the sensitivity to 4-fermion final states .    to deduce constraints on 4-body final states from the published fermi - lat constraints on 2-body final states we utilize the following procedure . for each of the 2-body and 4-body final states that we consider we calculate the photon spectrum , @xmath40 , and for each spectrum identify the peak energy of @xmath41 , which we define as @xmath42 .",
    "our motivation for this definition of @xmath42 comes from the fact that different channels with the same @xmath42 have roughly the same spectral shape . for all 2-body and 4-body channels , in figure  [ emax ]",
    "we show @xmath42 as a function of the dm mass .    as an example in fig .",
    "[ shape ] we show the shape of both @xmath40 and @xmath43 for the @xmath3 final state with @xmath44 gev , for the @xmath32 final state with @xmath45 gev , and for the @xmath46 final state with @xmath47 gev .",
    "all of these final states have the same @xmath42 .",
    "these figures show that at asymptotically low and high photon energies , the shapes of both @xmath40 and @xmath43 for the spectra with similar @xmath42 are similar .",
    "more generally , we derive an upper bound on @xmath11 at a given mass @xmath48 for a 4-body final state by matching its @xmath42 with the corresponding @xmath42 of a sm 2-body final state , at a mass @xmath49 .",
    "we determine the ratio of the total flux in our 4-body final state to the total flux from the 2-body sm final state , @xmath50 the lower photon energy limit of 0.5 gev is motivated by the lower energy cut - off in the fermi - lat dsphs study  @xcite .",
    "the simple approach we have outlined above is used to extract plausible bounds on 4-body states without having to run through a full maximum likelihood analysis .",
    "one question that we must address is how our 4-body final state upper bounds on @xmath11 depend on the particular choice of 2-body final state that we use for the scaling in equation  [ eq : scaling ] . to answer this question",
    "we have tested all 2-body scaling channels , and we generally find that the bounds obtained scaling to the @xmath32 and @xmath46 2-body final states agree within @xmath51 of each other . in the next section our bounds",

    "we compared these results with standard @xmath46 and @xmath32 final states .",
    "we also presented a well motivated @xmath5 model , where the lightest right - handed sneutrino ( @xmath166 ) is the dm candidate , which provides a realistic scenario incorporating all 4-body final states mentioned above .",
    "the main result of this paper is the constraint imposed on the @xmath90 plane for aforementioned 4-body channels by the reprocessed fermi - lat pass-8 data on dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "we found a wide range of dm masses that fit the gce in 4-body final states with distinct range of annihilation cross - sections characteristic of the final state .",
    "however a considerable area of the @xmath90 plane is disallowed by the dsph constraint , strongly constraining the dm interpretation of the gce .",
    "the scalar masses have limited impact on the analysis but @xmath68 provides the best fit to the spectra .",

    "compared to the @xmath2 final state , the dsphs are found to be considerably more constraining for @xmath69 and @xmath46 channels . on the other hand they are a less stringent constraint for the @xmath3 final state . out of the 95@xmath58 cl fit of @xmath181 gev and @xmath182 @xmath22/s ,",
    "a large area in the @xmath90 plane remains available if bounds are derived by scaling from the @xmath32 channel .",
