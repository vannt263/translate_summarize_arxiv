    "the study of black hole thermodynamics is certainly one of the most promising ways towards a deep understanding of the quantum nature of space and time .",
    "the pioneering works of bekenstein @xcite and hawking @xcite , based respectively on the study of the properties of black holes geometry rising from general relativity and a semiclassical combination of the latter with quantum field theory , would later give birth to the novel concept of space - time holography @xcite .",
    "it is then interesting to investigate the role of any possible extension of general relativity in the study of black hole thermodynamics in the hope of learning more about the nature of space - time at the quantum level .",
    "one of the old extensions of general relativity is the einstein - cartan theory of gravity . in this theory the intrinsic spin of a particle",
    "is naturally included in the geometric description of space - time using riemann - cartan geometry instead of the riemannian geometry , i.e. by introducing torsion besides the metric as another degree of freedom for space - time . in this theory",
    "the einstein field equations are replaced by what are commonly known as the cartan - sciama - kibble ( csk ) field equations , first discovered by cartan @xcite , then independently rediscovered later by kibble @xcite and sciama @xcite .",
    "ironically , the initial idea that led  . cartan to generalize the riemannian geometry and introduce the concept of torsion for space - time came from an analogy with the macroscopic concept of torsion in the physics of continuum media .",
    "this relation between space - time and continuum media stayed a mere analogy , though , up until 1967 when a. d. sakharov proposed that general relativity may after all be just a low - energy approximation to the dynamics of space - time in the same sense that elasticity is an approximation to the microstructure of solids @xcite .",
    "recently , various authors have investigated the idea of an eventual elasticity of space - time either by applying concepts from elasticity theory to explore its dynamics @xcite or by bringing novel interpretations to some fundamental concepts of modern cosmology such as inflation @xcite and cosmic strings @xcite by generalizing the three dimensional theory of defects to space - time .",
    "recently still , t. padmanabhan has taken up this idea of elastic space - time from a thermodynamic viewpoint and introduced an entropy functional to be associated with the elastic deformations @xcite . when extremized in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics , the entropy functional yields the equations of general relativity ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the functional implies that the contributions to the on - shell entropy of a bulk region of space - time reside only on the boundary of the region in accordance with the holographic principle .",
    "in addition , the entropy of spinless black holes is found to be proportional to the area of their event horizon in exact agreement with bekenstein - hawking formula .",
    "the ability of this approach to reproduce both the fundamental equations of general relativity and main results from the thermodynamics of black holes suggests that extending the approach into riemann - cartan space - times may provide a simple way to include spin in the study of black hole thermodynamics .",
    "the question then is whether it would be possible to construct a generalized functional that reproduces the full set of the csk field equations as well as familiar results from black hole thermodynamics .",
    "it is our aim in this paper to show that this is indeed possible .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ csk ] we introduce an entropy functional for space - times with torsion and show how the csk field equations emerge from varying the functional with respect to the deformation vector field . in sect .",
    "[ osef ] we use the csk field equations to obtain a general form for the on - shell functional in which the boundary contributions are separated from the bulk ones .",
    "we then examine two specific cases of matter fields with spin embedded in space - time with torsion for which the functional takes exactly the form obtained by padmanabhan for riemannian space - times . moving on to space - times with an event horizon ,",
    "we show in sect .",
    "[ ebhs ] how the bekenstein - hawking entropy formula for a black hole with spin is recovered in our approach .",
    "we conclude this work with a discussion section to highlight and comment our main results .",
    "the motivation behind the introduction of an entropy functional by padmanabhan @xcite was to consider , in the spirit of sakharov , space - time as a continuum medium subject at low - energy to elastic deformations characterized by the differential deformation vector field ( or the displacement vector field ) @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are coordinates in the elastic space - time before and after deformation respectively .",
    "matter , through its energy - moment tensor @xmath4 , is viewed in this approach as a default inside the medium that spoils translational invariance in the field @xmath5 .",
    "it contributes to the functional through a quadratic coupling with @xmath5 .",
    "further , in order not to get more than second - order differential equations when the functional is varied with respect to @xmath5 , the former is constrained to contain at most first - order covariant derivatives of the latter . in @xcite the same arguments were used to introduce a general expression for the functional but a different philosophy was adopted to arrive at its final form which we reproduce here to serve as the starting point for our construction of a generalized version : @xmath6.\\label{eqn1}\\ ] ] the constant @xmath7 was determined to be @xmath8 and the scalar @xmath9 was constrained , using one of the bianchi identities in riemannian geometry , to be @xmath10 with @xmath11 being the ricci scalar and @xmath12 a cosmological constant .    in order to generalize the above functional for riemann - cartan space - times in the presence of matter with non - zero spin we need to take into account torsion , characterized by the tensor @xmath13}}^{k}=\\frac{1}{2}({\\gamma_{ij}}^{k}-{\\gamma_{ji}}^{k})$ ] , as an additional degree of freedom in the geometry of space - time ( @xmath14 being the affine connection . ) on the other hand , to handle matter with spin we know that , besides the symmetric energy - momentum tensor @xmath4 , one must also take into account the contributions of the spin - angular momentum tensor @xmath15 which is antisymmetric in its first two indices .",
    "now , in our approach metric and torsion will be taken to be emergent properties of space - time rather then being fundamental dynamical quantities in the same sense proposed in @xcite regarding the metric of riemannian space - times .",
    "therefore , instead of the usual general relativistic definition of the spin - angular momentum tensor @xmath15 based on the variation with respect to torsion @xcite , it is the field - theoretic definition @xcite @xmath16 that should be adopted in our approach .",
    "@xmath17 being @xmath18 matrices in some representation @xmath19 of the lorentz group generators acting on the fields @xmath20 . from the one used in @xcite .",
    "also , we shall use through out this paper letters from the middle of the latin alphabet to denote holonomic space - time indices and letters from the beginning of the alphabet to denote both anholonomic tangent - space indices and group representation indices .",
    "] from the tensor @xmath15 one can build another tensor , also antisymmetric in its first two indices , called the spin - energy potential and related to @xmath15 by @xcite @xmath21 hence the spin property of matter gives rise to an additional tensor that should also appear as , among other things , a translational - invariance breaking term inside the functional , i.e. in a term analogous to @xmath22 in ( [ eqn1 ] ) .    now",
    "the way to construct a scalar functional quadratic in the field @xmath5 and containing first - order derivatives of this latter , using the various contributions coming from the tensors mentioned above , is to judiciously contract the different indices each tensor brings to the functional with those of the field @xmath5 and its derivatives . to help us",
    "find the right combination among the many possibilities , we start with the form displayed in ( [ eqn1 ] ) and successively add terms brought by the new ingredients in such a way that our generalized functional reduces to ( [ eqn1 ] ) in the absence of spin .    beginning with the translational - invariance breaking terms ,",
    "the analogue of the quadratic term @xmath22 in ( [ eqn1 ] ) that could be constructed from @xmath23 , given its antisymmetry in the first two indices , is @xmath24 with still one more index to be contracted away . by",
    "dimensional analysis , however , we know that @xmath25 has the dimension of an energy - momentum tensor @xcite while the torsion tensor @xmath26 has the same dimension as that of a derivative ( @xmath27 )",
    ". so the natural analogue of @xmath22 would be @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the trace of torsion .",
    "now there is still the possibility of producing a quadratic term by contracting two components of the field @xmath5 in an antisymmetric way with @xmath30 .",
    "indeed , if we introduce the oriented 2-surface @xmath31 constructed from the parallelogram formed by two components @xmath32 and @xmath33 , then @xmath31 is quadratic in the field @xmath5 and antisymmetric",
    ". hence we shall add @xmath34}w^{jk}$ ] as a third translational - invariance breaking term in the functional .",
    "next , note that in the absence of spin we had the quadratic term @xmath35 containing the contributions of the scalar curvature and the cosmological constant through @xmath9 .",
    "since the additional feature brought into the geometry by torsion is antisymmetry , we expect the analogue of @xmath36 to be a quadratic term that would rise as an antisymmetric coupling with the field @xmath5 and whose origin would be due to torsion .",
    "hence we use again the oriented 2-surface @xmath37 and introduce the term @xmath38 .",
    "the tensor @xmath39 is antisymmetric , coming from torsion , and whose explicit form should be determined using constraints from geometry as we did for @xmath40 in the absence of spin @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we shall use again one of the bianchi identities but in riemann - cartan space - time .    staying with the contributions of geometry ,",
    "it is clear that other ways of introducing torsion contracted with the field @xmath5 without the use of @xmath23 still exist . to guide us in the search for the right combination",
    "we simply proceed by building on the kinetic term in ( [ eqn1 ] ) consisting of the first two terms of the integrand .",
    "indeed , the simplest and most straightforward way to introduce a coupling between the fields @xmath26 and @xmath5 is to perform , in a way reminiscent of gauge theories , the following substitution @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the trace of @xmath26 . actually , a satisfactory justification for this seemingly _ ad hoc _ substitution will shortly emerge below .",
    "finally , by dimensional analysis we also learn that contracting the tensor @xmath23 with one component @xmath5 and one covariant derivative @xmath43 produces a scalar of the same dimension as the term @xmath22 .",
    "therefore we also add into the functional the following covariant scalar @xmath44 .",
    "in fact , when written in terms of @xmath15 using ( [ eqn3 ] ) , this term displays both a symmetric and antisymmetric coupling with regard to the two indices of @xmath43 as well as those of @xmath5 and @xmath33 . furthermore ,",
    "if we perform on this term the above mentioned substitution @xmath45 we see the emergence of precisely the quadratic term @xmath28 which we introduced above from different motivations , so that all the terms nicely hang together at the end .    putting all these terms together into a generalized entropy functional , this",
    "latter reads @xmath46,\\label{eqn4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used the relation ( [ eqn3 ] ) to trade everywhere @xmath23 for @xmath15 in order to be able later to compare our final results with those given in reference @xcite .",
    "the detailed form we get when substituting the explicit expression of @xmath47 is @xmath48.\\nonumber\\\\\\label{eqn5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in what follows we shall see that this functional reproduces both groups of field equations of cartan - sciama - kibble theory if we demand that it be extremized for any deformation vector field @xmath5 . to perform correctly the variation of ( [ eqn5 ] ) with respect to the field",
    "@xmath5 , we symbolically write the oriented 2-surface @xmath37 of the parallelogram as @xmath49 in order to take care of the oriented product .",
    "thus we have @xmath50 . when this is done in the variation of the functional , the condition @xmath51 for all @xmath5 yields @xmath52}u^{j}+\\,\\big(2\\alpha q_{i}\\delta_{jk}-2\\alpha q_{k}\\delta_{ij}+\\sigma_{ikj}\\big)\\nabla^{j}u^{k}\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\nonumber \\\\+\\,\\big[\\lambda g_{ij}+t_{ij}-\\theta_{ij}-2\\alpha\\nabla_{[i}q_{j]}+\\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla^{k}+2q^{k})(\\sigma_{ijk}+\\sigma_{kij}+\\sigma_{kji})\\big]u^{j}=0 . \\label{eqn6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] next , one may write the second - order derivatives of @xmath5 in ( [ eqn6 ] ) as a combination of first - order and zero - order derivatives if one uses the following contracted ricci identity in riemann - cartan geometry @xcite : @xmath53}u^{j}=-r_{ij}u^{j}-2{q_{ij}}^{k}\\nabla_{k}u^{j}$ ] . hence identity ( [ eqn6 ] ) becomes @xmath54\\nabla^{j}u^{k}\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\nonumber \\\\-\\,\\big[\\alpha r_{ij}-\\lambda g_{ij}-t_{ij}+\\theta_{ij}+2\\alpha\\nabla_{[i}q_{j]}-\\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla^{k}+2q^{k})(\\sigma_{ijk}+\\sigma_{kij}+\\sigma_{kji})\\big]u^{j}=0,\\nonumber\\\\\\label{eqn7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which , in turn , may be satisfied for any @xmath32 if and only if each of the factors vanishes separately , that is @xmath55 and @xmath56}+\\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla^{k}+2q^{k})(\\sigma_{ijk}+\\sigma_{kij}+\\sigma_{kji}).\\qquad\\label{eqn9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we recognize in ( [ eqn8 ] ) the first group of the csk field equations @xcite .",
    "now the second group of field equations of the csk theory has also emerged and it resides in ( [ eqn9 ] ) .",
    "this can readily be seen as follows . from ( [ eqn8 ] )",
    "one easily extracts the following identities : + @xmath57}+2\\alpha \\nabla^{k}q_{ijk}$ ] and @xmath58 . using these after taking the antisymmetric part of ( [ eqn9 ] ) and then comparing the result with the following bianchi identity in riemann - cartan geometry @xcite : @xmath59}=\\nabla^{k}q_{ijk}+2q^{k}q_{ijk}+2\\nabla_{[i}q_{j]}$ ] , immediately reveals what the antisymmetric tensor @xmath39 is : @xmath60}.\\label{eqn10}\\ ] ] it is a tensor built from torsion as we argued above that it would be . finally , substituting ( [ eqn10 ] ) into ( [ eqn9 ] ) , this latter reads @xmath61 this is the second group of the csk field equations comprising a cosmological constant .",
    "having built an entropy functional that reproduces the full set of the csk field equations when extremized , our aim is to apply it to the evaluation of the entropy of black holes with non - zero spin in space - times with torsion .",
    "before we do that , however , we shall first derive in the next section a general form for the on - shell functional and examine two specific cases of matter fields with non - zero spin .",
    "the study of the entropy functional we are going to conduct in this section will be on - shell , i.e. the csk field equations will be assumed to be satisfied in the bulk region of the space - time considered , so that entropy is kept extremized in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "when the functional ( [ eqn5 ] ) is integrated by parts and both groups of the csk field equations ( [ eqn8 ] ) and ( [ eqn11 ] ) are taken into account along with the constraint ( [ eqn10 ] ) on @xmath39 , the entropy functional becomes @xmath62}+8\\pi gq^{k}\\sigma_{ijk}\\big)w^{ij}\\big].\\label{eqn12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using stokes theorem on the first parentheses and the bianchi identity on the second , the functional also takes the following form @xmath63}\\big)w^{ij } , \\label{eqn13}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the determinant of the three - dimensional metric corresponding to the hypersurface @xmath65 bounding the integration region @xmath66 of space - time , and @xmath67 a unit vector normal to that hypersurface .",
    "we therefore conclude that the contributions to the on - shell entropy of a bulk region @xmath66 of riemann - cartan space - times do not reside exclusively on the boundary @xmath65 but do partially come from the bulk region @xmath66 as well .",
    "we shall nevertheless expose below two specific cases of matter fields for which we recover an entropy whose contributions solely come from the boundary @xmath65 and whose explicit expression coincides with the one found by padmanabhan for riemannian space - times . in what follows",
    "we shall first treat the case of the spin - half dirac field and then examine the case of spin fluids .",
    "the lagrangian of a free dirac field @xmath68 in a curved space - time with torsion is @xcite @xmath69}\\psi - m\\overline{\\psi}\\psi,\\label{eqn14}\\ ] ] where @xmath70}\\psi$ ] with @xmath71 being the riemannian part of the tangent - space connection and @xmath72 is the contortion tensor .",
    "@xmath73 are space - time dirac gamma matrices related to the constant tangent - space gamma matrices @xmath74 through the vielbeins @xmath75 . using the definition ( [ eqn2 ] ) with @xmath76}$ ] for dirac spinors @xcite",
    ", one finds that the spin - angular momentum tensor is given by @xmath77}\\psi , \\label{eqn15}\\ ] ] and hence is a totaly antisymmetric tensor . as a consequence , the third term in the first parentheses of ( [ eqn12 ] ) vanishes .",
    "but when using ( [ eqn8 ] ) to express torsion in terms of @xmath15 it follows that @xmath78 is also totaly antisymmetric and hence traceless .",
    "so the content of the second parentheses in ( [ eqn12 ] ) also vanishes . finally , recalling that in riemann - cartan space - times one uses in the covariant derivative an affine connection @xmath79 that is related to the christoffel connection @xmath80 by @xcite @xmath81 one easily sees from the total antisymmetry of torsion that @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the covariant derivative in riemannian space - times .",
    "hence , the form of the entropy functional for a riemann - cartan space - time in the presence of a dirac field reduces to that of space - time without torsion @xcite @xmath84 the effects of torsion , and therefore of spin , are nevertheless still present ; being encoded inside the deformation vector field @xmath5 .",
    "proceeding to the case of a space - time filled with a spin fluid we shall use the following standard definition @xcite : by a spin fluid we mean a perfect fluid of density @xmath85 , four - velocity @xmath86 , and whose spin - angular momentum tensor @xmath87 is given by @xmath88 @xmath89 is the spin - density assumed to satisfy the so - called frenkel condition @xmath90 .",
    "then from ( [ eqn8 ] ) we have @xmath91 , whence we immediately see that the previous frenkel condition produces a traceless torsion @xmath92 .",
    "integral ( [ eqn12 ] ) therefore reduces to @xmath93 further , the explicit expression one obtains for @xmath78 from ( [ eqn8 ] ) and ( [ eqn18 ] ) is @xmath94 .",
    "then , on using ( [ eqn16 ] ) we find that @xmath95 and so integral ( [ eqn19 ] ) gives back ( [ eqn17 ] ) as the on - shell entropy functional for space - time containing spin fluids .",
    "having obtained the general form of the on - shell entropy functional we now proceed to its evaluation in space - time with an event horizon created by a black hole with non - zero spin , i.e. either a rotating black hole or a static black hole with a non - zero quantum spin . for that purpose",
    ", we shall adopt the idea and follow the strategy that were introduced in @xcite for treating event horizons in an approach that views space - time as a continuum elastic medium .",
    "the idea is to view the forward translation in time @xmath96 as a byproduct of the deformation @xmath5 , which reads @xmath97 on a spacelike hypersurface whose unit normal being @xmath5 , whereas the event horizon is viewed as a singular point in the deformation field @xmath5 on which this latter satisfies @xmath98 .",
    "the strategy then consists of evaluating the functional in the rindler - like space near the horizon .    according to ( [ eqn8 ] )",
    ", torsion is algebraically related to the spin angular momentum so that torsion is vanishing outside the sources . hence integral ( [ eqn12 ] )",
    "greatly simplifies when the boundary enclosing the hole is taken to be the event horizon , for then ( [ eqn12 ] ) reduces to @xmath99 where we have introduced the four - acceleration @xmath100 of the field @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the next step is to go to the rindler - like space near the horizon to evaluate ( [ eqn20 ] ) .",
    "for that , we need a solution to the csk field equations , which reduce to einstein vacuum equations outside the sources .",
    "usually , when dealing with vacuum einstein equations one exploits the underling spherical symmetry and adopts the schwarzschild metric which is the unique static spherical - symmetric solution according to birkhoff s theorem .",
    "dealing with non - zero spin black holes , however , we do nt have spherical symmetry anymore but expect an axial - symmetric solution whose axis would coincide with that of spin .",
    "so our choice of space - time will be the kerr space - time .",
    "note that , concerning black holes with a quantum spin , our choice of space - time matches that of @xcite where kerr space - time is identified as a geometric model for the spinning electron . recall that the kerr metric around a black hole is specified by the mass @xmath101 and the angular momentum per unit mass @xmath102 of the hole . for the case of a quantum spin",
    ", it is @xmath103 that should play the role of the classical angular momentum @xmath104 , i.e. @xmath105 .",
    "now the kerr metric in boyer - lindquist coordinates may be written as follows @xcite @xmath106 from this metric which is singular for @xmath107 one deduces the radius of the event horizon @xmath108 , the area of the horizon @xmath109 , and the surface gravity @xmath110 @xmath111 before we proceed to the extraction of the rindler - like metric , we would like to make the following remark .",
    "it is well - known that according to ( [ eqn21 ] ) one gets a naked singularity whenever @xmath112 .",
    "so one might worry about such a singularity when dealing with quantum spins given that for a kerr electron @xcite , as well as for a nucleus , one has @xmath113 .",
    "for the case of macroscopic black holes , however , we are dealing not with one nucleus but with collapsed nuclear matter whose final spin scarcely averages to a non - zero value @xmath114 , so that the ratio @xmath115 stays far below the dangerous limit of producing a naked singularity .",
    "now , to extract the metric of the near - horizon region we follow @xcite and expand ( [ eqn21 ] ) in terms of the variable @xmath116 , keeping only the leading contribution . denoting by the subscript @xmath117 all quantities evaluated on the horizon the kerr metric takes , up to the conformal transformation @xmath118 , the following rindler - like form @xcite @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 . having this simple form of the metric we can now proceed , following @xcite , to the evaluation of ( [ eqn20 ] ) . remembering that the horizon sits at @xmath122 , integral ( [ eqn20 ] ) reduces to @xmath123 where we have integrated along the @xmath124-periodic euclideanized time @xmath125 that removes the conical singularity @xcite .",
    "next , we recall that for the levi - civit covariant derivative @xmath83 one has on the horizon for which @xmath126 the following limit @xmath127 @xcite ( see also @xcite . )",
    "thereby , the above integral evaluates to @xmath128 thus recovering the bekenstein - hawking formula for black holes with spin . in our approach , this last result is valid for black holes with an intrinsic quantum spin as well as for black holes with a classical spinning , i.e. the rotating black holes .",
    "by extending the construction of the entropy functional for space - times with torsion viewed as continuum elastic media , in order to study their thermodynamics , we have built a functional using arguments related to the physics of continuum media and their defects .",
    "we saw that the functional remarkably reproduces exactly both groups of the csk field equations when demanding that entropy be extremized in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics for all possible deformations of space - time .",
    "furthermore , the new terms that appeared in the generalized functional when torsion and spin are taken into account actually add a nice intuitive interpretation for the rising of space - time torsion from spin .",
    "indeed , we see from ( [ eqn5 ] ) that in addition to the quadratic coupling with the deformation vector field through the simple product of two components of the latter , the spin - angular momentum tensor has another quadratic coupling that is orientation - dependent . more precisely , it couples to the oriented 2-surface area formed by two components of the deformation field .",
    "thus , whereas the csk field equations ( [ eqn8 ] ) give a quantitative description of how space - time torsion rises from spin , this new form of coupling in the functional adds the following qualitative description . while energy - momentum deforms space - time in analogy to a bowling ball that bends a two - dimensional rubber sheet when placed on it , spin - angular momentum deforms space - time by changing also the orientation of each deformed infinitesimal area in analogy to an elastic rod that torques when the relative orientation of its edges gets twisted .",
    "the term @xmath44 enhances this analogy since it represents a contribution that evokes the `` moment '' of the deformation gradient .",
    "now , although every term of the functional ( [ eqn5 ] ) was motivated using physical arguments , our construction remains heuristic and the question of uniqueness of integral ( [ eqn5 ] ) has to be addressed here .",
    "in what follows we shall argue that integral ( [ eqn5 ] ) is actually the unique functional that when varied recovers exactly the csk field equations ( [ eqn8 ] ) and ( [ eqn11 ] ) .",
    "in fact , suppose there are other terms that might be added inside the integral to make it more general and still leave unchanged equations ( [ eqn8 ] ) and ( [ eqn11 ] ) .",
    "these additional terms , if any , could only appear in the second and third parenthesis of ( [ eqn5 ] ) since the structure of the first parenthesis is dictated by the functional in the absence of spin while the generality of the fourth parenthesis is already assured by the tensor @xmath39 .",
    "hence , the additional terms would be of the form @xmath129 and @xmath130 , where @xmath131 would be a symmetric tensor built quadratically ( for dimensional reasons ) from torsion and the spin - angular momentum while @xmath132 would be a third rank tensor linear in torsion and spin - angular momentum . when these terms are added to ( [ eqn5 ] ) and this latter is varied , one learns that in order for ( [ eqn8 ] ) and ( [ eqn11 ] ) to remain valid , one should impose on @xmath133 and @xmath134 the following constraints : @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "although the first of these constraints is an algebraic one and may easily be achieved in the framework of the csk theory by a simple combination of @xmath137 s and @xmath138 s , the second constraint would bring an additional dynamical equation to the theory , and hence could not be kept without departing from the csk theory in which dynamics emerges solely from ( [ eqn11 ] ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that integral ( [ eqn5 ] ) is the unique extension to riemann - cartan space - times of the entropy functional capable in the framework of our approach to lead exactly to the csk theory .",
    "this extension to riemann - cartan space - times of the functional also brings a new insight on the holographic principle concerning space - times with torsion . indeed , in sect .",
    "[ osef ] we saw that contrary to the case of zero - spin , the entropy of the bulk region of space - time does not rise solely from the boundary of the region but gets contributions from the bulk as well .",
    "hence , the fact that this same entropy when extremized yields the einstein - cartan gravity theory without any prior assumption of the latter suggests that , due to torsion , the holographic principle does not necessarily apply for gravity with spin in riemann - cartan space - times in general .",
    "we nevertheless saw two specific cases for which the system is indeed holographic and displays the same general formula for entropy found by padmanabhan for riemannian space - times .",
    "now , this unconformity with the holographic principle is not due primarily to torsion created by the spin angular momentum but more specifically to the trace of torsion that enters the bulk integral in ( [ eqn12 ] ) .",
    "space - times with torsion are thus holographic whenever the spin - angular momentum tensor of the system is traceless .",
    "this observation helps us better understand the relevance to holography of dirac fields and spin fluids .",
    "dirac fields and spin fluids make space - times with torsion holographic because of the tracelessness of their spin - angular momentum tensors giving rise to a traceless torsion . for dirac fields",
    "this comes from the anticommutation of the gamma matrices whereas for spin fluids it is thanks to the frenkel condition @xmath90 .",
    "conversely , denoting by @xmath139 the trace of the spin - angular momentum tensor @xmath15 then , since @xmath140 , we arrive upon using ( [ eqn12 ] ) at the following statement .",
    "if one ventures forth and adopts holography as a first principle then one would conclude from this that in space - times with torsion are allowed only systems whose spin - angular momentum tensor is either traceless or constrained to obey the following equation , @xmath141}+8\\pi g\\sigma^{k}\\sigma_{ijk}=0 $ ] .    finally , in sect .",
    "[ ebhs ] , applying our functional to space - times with an event horizon we saw that the bekenstein - hawking entropy formula is what is recovered for black holes with a classical spinning and/or a quantum spin . in the latter case",
    ", the explicit dependence on spin one gets from ( [ eqn25 ] ) is @xmath142 from this formula we see that in order for a black hole s quantum spin to bring a notable difference with respect to the thermodynamics of schwarzschild black holes , the average quadratic spin of the nucleons composing the black hole must be of order @xmath143 .",

    "thus , even if all the nucleon spins inside the black hole where aligned , which is very plausible in gravity with torsion given that spin - torsion interaction induces spin alignment in the presence of strong gravity inside collapsed matter @xcite , formula ( [ eqn26 ] ) shows that the quantum spin is far from being able to bring any significant contribution to the thermodynamics of macroscopic black holes .",

    "<S> by viewing space - time as a continuum elastic medium and introducing an entropy functional for its elastic deformations , t. padmanabhan has shown that general relativity emerges from varying the functional and that the latter suggests holography for gravity and yields the bekenstein - hawking entropy formula . in this paper we extend this idea to riemann - cartan space - times by constructing an entropy functional for the elastic deformations of space - times with torsion . </S>",

    "<S> our generalized functional shows that the contributions to the on - shell entropy of a bulk region in riemann - cartan space - times come from the boundary as well as the bulk and hence does not suggest that holography would also apply for gravity with spin in space - times with torsion . </S>",
