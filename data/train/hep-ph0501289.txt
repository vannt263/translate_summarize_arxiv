    "several years ago advances in non - relativistic effective theory made it possible to compute quarkonium properties at the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) .",
    "since the perturbative approach assumes that the non - relativistic energy scale @xmath3 is larger than the strong interaction scale @xmath4 , these computations apply to the lowest bottomonium states and heavy quark current spectral functions near threshold such as those relevant to top quark pair production .",
    "nnlo results have been obtained for matching coefficients @xcite , energy levels @xcite , wave functions at the origin @xcite and spectral functions  @xcite , principally for the @xmath0-wave states , which are the most important ones for applications @xcite .",
    "it was observed that the perturbative corrections are almost always very large .",
    "although the origin of these large corrections can sometimes be understood as being due to mass renormalization @xcite or large logarithms , it is currently believed that a complete third ( next - to - next - to - next - to - leading / nnnlo ) order calculation is necessary to describe accurately even the case of top quark pair production near threshold . that this is a difficult undertaking is reflected by the fact that partial results at nnnlo exist for various quantities @xcite , but only the @xmath0-wave ground state energy is currently fully known at third order @xcite ,",
    "save for an unknown constant @xmath5 in the coulomb potential . in this paper , we take one further step and compute the nnnlo corrections from the qcd coulomb potential to the @xmath0-wave energy levels and wave function at the origin for arbitrary principal quantum number @xmath1 , and to the @xmath0-wave green function ( spectral function ) relevant to top quark pair production . together with the known non - coulomb energy level corrections @xcite this determines the @xmath0-wave energy levels completely at third order for any @xmath1 .",
    "the correction to the green function and wave functions at the origin forms part of the complete third - order top quark pair production cross section .",
    "another motivation for first concentrating on the coulomb corrections is that the schrdinger equation with the coulomb potential can be solved numerically , and the result can be compared to the perturbative computation .",
    "this is no longer possible once the singular non - coulomb potentials are included , in which case the perturbative approach is the only option .",
    "comparing the perturbative approximation to the numerical solution allows us to estimate the convergence of the successive approximations .",
    "the computation of coulomb corrections can be phrased in the language of elementary quantum mechanics .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the heavy quark pole mass , and @xmath8 the coulomb potential of the strong force . with @xmath9",
    "the potential reads , up to the fourth order in the expansion in the strong coupling @xmath10 , @xmath11   + \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s}{4\\pi}\\right)^{\\!2 } \\bigg[a_2 +   \\big(2 a_1\\beta_0+\\beta_1\\big ) \\ln\\frac{\\mu^2}{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ { q}$}}^2 } +   \\beta_0 ^ 2 \\ln^2\\frac{\\mu^2}{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ { q}$}}^2}\\bigg ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\,+\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s}{4\\pi}\\right)^{\\!3 } \\bigg[a_3 + 8\\pi^2 c_a^3\\ln\\frac{\\nu^2}{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ { q}$}}^2 } +   \\big(3 a_2\\beta_0 + 2 a_1\\beta_1+\\beta_2\\big)\\ln\\frac{\\mu^2}{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ { q}$}}^2 } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace*{1.9cm}+ \\,\\big(3",

    "the constants @xmath18 , @xmath19 are given in @xcite , the @xmath20 term is from @xcite , while the three - loop constant term @xmath5 , currently unknown , is estimated to be 6240 ( @xmath21 ) and 3840 ( @xmath22 ) @xcite .",
    "the group theory factors for su(@xmath23 ) gauge theory ( @xmath24 in qcd ) are @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 denotes the number of quarks whose masses are smaller than @xmath29 and neglected ( @xmath21 for bottom systems , @xmath22 for top ) .",
    "@xmath10 refers to the strong coupling in the @xmath14 scheme at the renormalization scale @xmath30 , while @xmath31 is a scale necessary to define the separation of potential and ultrasoft effects .",
    "the dependence on this factorization scale cancels in physical quantities when the ultrasoft correction is included .",
    "when @xmath32 the spectrum of the hamiltonian reproduces the well - known bohr energy levels . this will be our zeroth order approximation .",
    "we consider quarkonium systems in which @xmath33 is small , and compute the spectrum in a perturbation expansion in @xmath10 .",
    "hence , the coefficient of @xmath34 in @xmath35 is considered a perturbation of the @xmath1th order , and the third - order result we are aiming at requires up to three insertions of the @xmath36 potential , but only one insertion of the order @xmath37 potential .",
    "we shall focus on the @xmath0-wave green function @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes a position eigenstate with eigenvalue @xmath40 , and compute the matrix element of the right - hand side of ( omitting the argument @xmath41 of the green function ) @xmath42 @xmath43 denotes the zeroth - order green function , and @xmath44 the @xmath1th order perturbation potential .",
    "the green function @xmath45 has single poles at the exact @xmath0-wave energy levels @xmath46 , such that @xmath47 inserting @xmath48 into this equation , we can determine @xmath49 and @xmath50 by comparing the expansion of ( [ nearpole ] ) in @xmath10 with ( [ expandedgreen ] ) near @xmath46 .",
    "we recall that @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "the details of the calculation are too lengthy to be reproduced here .",
    "however , we sketch the computation of the threefold insertion @xmath53 of @xmath54 in the appendix",
    ".    there is an equivalent quantum - field - theoretical description of the calculation , which is the appropriate one in the context of systematic higher - order computations of quarkonium properties @xcite .",
    "after all the quantum - mechanical description breaks down beyond some accuracy , since ( a ) the system is sensitive to the short - distance quantum fluctuations , and ( b ) the restriction to the quark - antiquark sector of the fock space is inadequate .",
    "systematic calculations therefore start from qcd and obtain effective lagrangians by systematically integrating out short - distance fluctuations ( @xmath55 ) as well as all massless degrees of freedom down to the ultrasoft energy scale @xmath3 , which characterizes the size of energy fluctuations in a quarkonium bound state .",
    "the result is an effective lagrangian , in which the potentials appear as matching coefficients @xcite .",
    "in particular the coulomb potential is regarded as the matching coefficient of a relevant operator , and differs from the wilson loop definition beginning at order @xmath37 .",
    "consequently , the @xmath56 term which appears in the static potential @xcite is absent , and replaced by a logarithm of the factorization scale @xmath31 @xcite as shown in ( [ fullcoulomb ] ) .",
    "the computation of coulomb corrections is based on the lagrangian @xmath57 & & + \\,\\int d^3{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ { r}$}}\\,\\left[\\psi^\\dagger \\psi\\right]\\!(x+{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ { r}$}}\\,)\\ , v({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ { r}$}})\\left[\\chi^\\dagger \\chi\\right]\\!(x),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the ( colour - singlet ) coulomb potential , and where the non - relativistic two - component field @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) destroys ( creates ) a heavy quark ( anti - quark ) .",
    "there are other terms in the effective lagrangian that have to be included for a complete nnnlo calculation .",
    "the point we wish to make here is that these are well - understood , and hence there is a well - defined procedure to separate the complete calculation into several simpler parts , of which the calculation of coulomb corrections is one .",
    "an important feature of ( [ pnrqcd ] ) is that the leading - order coulomb potential can not be treated as a perturbation , and must be included in the zeroth order approximation together with the bilinear terms .",
    "@xmath61 is essentially the propagator of this theory .",
    "we can also obtain @xmath45 in ( [ ge ] ) directly by computing the two point function @xmath62(x ) [ \\chi^\\dagger\\psi](0)|\\omega\\rangle,\\ ] ] with @xmath63 the fock space vacuum state .",
    "this makes it clear that the green function is closely related to inclusive heavy quark - anti - quark cross sections in @xmath64 collisions , where the case of the top quark is particularly interesting .",
    "in this section we present our result for the third - order correction from the coulomb potential to the @xmath0-wave energy levels and wave functions at the origin ( squared ) for arbitrary principal quantum number @xmath1 . the corrections ( notation as in ( [ energyexpansion],[psiexpansion ] ) )",
    "are parameterized as @xmath65 where @xmath66 stands for the correction , when only the coulomb potential is included in the effective lagrangian . by definition",
    "` @xmath67 ' denotes all the remaining corrections , which originate from additional potentials and an ultrasoft non - potential interaction .",
    "together with the non - coulomb third - order correction @xmath68 to energy level @xcite , we obtain a complete result for the bound state energies to order @xmath69 for any @xmath1 . for the wave function , however , @xmath70 is not yet known .",
    "we should emphasize that we define @xmath71 by the residue of the correlation function ( [ nrcorr ] ) of non - relativistic currents .",
    "the non - coulomb corrections arise from potentials which cause short - distance singularities , such that @xmath72 are factorization scheme - dependent quantities .",
    "this scheme - dependence is canceled by short - distance coefficients , which we do not discuss here , but which are known to the same order as @xmath72 is known ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "the energy corrections from the coulomb potential are organized as follows , @xmath74,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the harmonic sum .",
    "for later convenience we introduce the nested harmonic sums @xmath77 in the following we omit the argument of harmonic sums which is always understood to be the principal quantum number @xmath1 .",
    "the coefficients of the logarithmic terms are fixed by the renormalization group in terms of the @xmath13-function and the @xmath78 from lower orders .",

    ".    having determined @xmath139 , we are in the position to predict the masses of the excited @xmath0-level states at the third order .",
    "( an analysis of the complete spectrum at second order was performed in @xcite . )",
    "we focus on the spin - triplet states @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "the successive approximations up to the third order are shown in figure  [ fig:2s3s ] for @xmath160gev as a function of the renormalization scale .",
    "for @xmath30 between @xmath161gev and @xmath150gev it appears that the large third - order correction is welcome to bring the theoretical result closer to the observed masses .",
    "however , at the natural scales @xmath162gev ( @xmath163 ) and @xmath164gev ( @xmath165 ) the nnlo result agrees well with data and the nnnlo correction renders the prediction too large . as is apparent from the figure , the conclusion is that the perturbative computation of bottomonium masses is applicable only to the ground state , @xmath116 , while the excited states , involving larger distances , appear to be in the non - perturbative regime .",
    "it can be seen from ( [ mass2s],[mass3s ] ) that the nnnlo term for @xmath145 is dominated by the coulomb correction .",
    "we briefly discuss the situation for the toponium masses .",
    "toponium bound states do not exist in nature due to large decay width @xmath166gev of the top quark @xcite , however the remnant of the 1s toponium state should be visible as an enhancement in the cross section @xmath167 near threshold .",
    "the convergence of the series expansion for the toponium 1s mass is therefore a good measure for the accuracy to which the top quark mass might be determined from this cross section @xcite .",
    "the method suggested in @xcite relies on determining @xmath168 from the cross section measurement and obtaining the top quark @xmath14 mass from @xmath169 , since both relations are expected to be expressible in terms of well - behaved perturbative expansions . adopting @xmath170gev , @xmath22 , @xmath171mev and the natural scale @xmath172gev , where @xmath173 , we obtain @xmath174 the sum of the series varies only by about @xmath175mev when the scale is taken between @xmath176 and @xmath175gev , although the convergence is no longer satisfactory at the lower scale .",
    "the small uncertainty implies that @xmath169 can be determined with little theoretical error from the cross section .",
    "the largest uncertainty in the determination of the top quark @xmath177 mass then results from the unknown four - loop coefficient in the relation between the @xmath177 mass and the pole mass , which is needed to convert @xmath169 to the @xmath177 mass , as already observed in @xcite .",
    "this uncertainty is estimated to be around @xmath178mev ( see table  2 of @xcite ) .",
    "our conclusions are in good agreement with @xcite , where one of us investigated the direct determination of the top quark @xmath177 mass from @xmath179 also using the nnnlo result for the 1s energy level .",
    "we should emphasize that none of these estimates take into account electroweak corrections , which are non - negligible , and must be included in the mass relations and cross section prediction before a comparison with the experimental cross section can be attempted .",
    "in this section we turn to the discussion of the @xmath0-wave coulomb green function , and to the wave function of the origin squared ( residues of the green function at the bound state poles ) . since the third - order correction is not completely known , we include in this section only the coulomb corrections as defined in section  [ sec : result ] , i.e.  we also neglect the ( known ) non - coulomb correction at second order .",
    "the series expansions seem to be out of control for the wave functions in the bottomonium system , hence we focus on the case of the top quark and set @xmath22 .",
    "we also set @xmath180 .      the numerical version of the general result for the @xmath0-state coulomb wave function at the origin squared reads , for @xmath109 , @xmath181 , \\label{toppsi1}\\\\[0.2 cm ] \\big|\\psi_2(0)\\big|^2_c & = & \\frac{(m_t c_f\\alpha_s)^3}{64\\pi } \\bigg [ 1 + \\alpha_s \\big(-0.1769 + 3.661\\,l\\big )   + \\alpha_s^2 \\big(10.19 - 3.861\\,l + 8.933\\,l^2\\big )   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace*{-1 cm } + \\,\\alpha_s^3 \\big(- 20.36               + 6.446\\,\\ln\\left(\\frac{2\\nu}{m_t c_f \\alpha_s}\\right )                + 65.31\\,l - 19.09\\,l^2 + 18.17\\,l^3\\big )",

    "we re - expressed the expansion in terms of the ps mass , treating @xmath182 .",
    "however , we note that contrary to the energy levels , the introduction of the ps mass does not change qualitatively the behaviour of the expansion , neither would this be expected on theoretical grounds .",
    "our reference top quark mass is @xmath183gev , and the ultrasoft factorization scale is chosen to be @xmath184 such that the corresponding logarithm in ( [ toppsi1 ] ) vanishes .",
    "we also normalized the result to the lo wave function at the scale @xmath185gev .",
    "it is clearly seen from the figure that the approximations converge , and that the inclusion of the new third - order correction stabilizes the prediction further , provided @xmath30 is larger than about @xmath186gev .",
    "we find a similar behaviour for @xmath187 , where , however , the enhancement of the wave function relative to leading order is about @xmath188 ( @xmath163 ) and @xmath189 ( @xmath165 ) rather than roughly @xmath190 as at @xmath116 .",
    "it may be disconcerting that the perturbative expansion breaks down already at scales as large as @xmath191gev , where the strong coupling is still small .",
    "a more detailed analysis shows that this early breakdown is caused primarily by the @xmath192 terms in the coulomb potential .",
    "we also note that at @xmath193 , where @xmath173 , the series expansions shown above are sign - alternating in contrast to the corresponding expressions for the energy levels , which exhibit fixed - sign behaviour .",
    "it is a general fact that for sign - alternating series of a certain regularity , the convergence of the expansion is much improved by choosing a larger scale @xcite , since this renders the series coefficients _ and _ the expansion parameter @xmath10 smaller .",
    "this explains the stability seen in the figure towards scales larger than the natural scale @xmath193 , and suggests that an error estimate for @xmath71 from varying the scale between @xmath194 and @xmath195 may be misleadingly large .",
    "we shall see in the following subsection that this is indeed the case .",
    "in addition to the energy levels and wave functions at the origin we have also computed the full @xmath0-wave green function up to the third order in the presence of the coulomb potential as described in section  [ sec : outline ] .",
    "the result is expressed in terms of multiple sums that can be evaluated numerically only .",
    "the coulomb green function plays an important role in the calculation of inclusive top quark pair production @xmath196 near threshold @xcite , since the bulk of the cross section is given by @xmath197 where @xmath198 is the top quark electric charge , @xmath199 the top quark width , and @xmath200 accounts for the vector coupling to the @xmath201 boson . the convergence of the perturbative approximation up to the second order has been the subject of many investigations several years ago ( see the review @xcite ) .",
    "we are now in the position to extend this investigation to the third order as far as the corrections from the coulomb potential are concerned .",
    "we computed the perturbative expansion of the green function given in ( [ expandedgreen ] ) .",
    "this strict expansion is never a good approximation , because it contains terms of the form @xmath202^k,\\ ] ] which originate from the expansion of ( [ nearpole ] ) around @xmath203 rather than the true pole position .",
    "these terms become numerically large near @xmath204 , but they can be summed by adding the exact pole structure and subtracting the expanded structure to the appropriate order , see @xcite for the corresponding expressions . in the following",
    ", `` perturbative approximation '' means that this resummation is included .",
    "alternatively , we computed the green function ( [ ge ] ) numerically by solving the schrdinger equation with the coulomb potential ( [ fullcoulomb ] ) exactly , following the method described in @xcite",
    ". we shall refer to this as the `` exact result '' .",
    "the exact result contains an arbitrary number of insertions of the perturbation potentials @xmath54 , @xmath205 , @xmath206 .",
    "the leading difference to the third - order perturbative approximation consists of fourth - order terms of the form @xmath207 , @xmath208 etc .",
    "comparing the two results we obtain an estimate of the importance of these multiple insertions and of the convergence of the perturbative approximation .",
    "for the following numerical study we assume @xmath209gev ( @xmath210 ) , four - loop evolution of @xmath10 , @xmath211gev , and @xmath212gev .",
    "it is crucial for an accurate prediction of the cross section not to use the top quark pole mass as an input parameter @xcite .",
    "our result is presented in terms of the top - quark potential - subtracted mass @xmath183gev defined in ( [ psmass ] ) .",
    "the conversion to the top quark @xmath14 mass is given in @xcite .",
    "we implement the ps scheme by working with an order - dependent pole mass .",
    "that is , in the n@xmath213lo perturbative approximation we compute the top quark pole mass @xmath214 from @xmath183gev according to ( [ psmass ] ) including the terms up to order @xmath215 , and use @xmath214 as an input to the green function .",
    "for instance , for renormalization scale @xmath216gev we obtain @xmath217gev for @xmath218 .",
    "the energy argument of the green function is then @xmath219 with @xmath220 the center - of - mass energy of the @xmath64 collision .",
    "-6 cm    the upper plot in figure  [ fig : cs_order ] shows the convergence of the successive perturbative approximations to the exact result for the green function ( cross section ) at the renormalization scale @xmath216gev .",
    "the location of the `` peak '' position is indeed stable under the inclusion of higher - order corrections as expected in the ps scheme . on the other hand ,",
    "the corrections to the magnitude of the cross section near the peak are significant , decreasing from about @xmath221 at nlo to about @xmath222 at nnnlo .",
    "the corrections alternate in sign as expected from the behaviour of the series expansion of @xmath223 .",
    "an important observation is that the third - order perturbative approximation coincides with the exact result within @xmath224 .",
    "hence the higher - order insertions of the perturbation potentials are negligible .",
    "the convergence of the approximations then suggests that the residual error from yet higher perturbation coulomb potentials @xmath225 etc .",
    "should be less than @xmath190 .",
    "in the lower plot of figure  [ fig : cs_order ] we display the renormalization scale dependence of the third - order perturbative approximation ( solid lines , @xmath226gev from top to bottom ) .",
    "it is immediately apparent that the scale dependence is very small from @xmath227 to @xmath175gev , but the result for @xmath228gev is far away .",
    "we can trace this anomalous behaviour directly to the breakdown of the perturbative expansion for @xmath223 at scales below @xmath186gev discussed in the previous subsection and displayed in figure  [ fig : wf ] .",
    "the exact result ( dashed line ) does _ not _ exhibit this behaviour for @xmath228gev , hence we conclude that the multiple insertions of the perturbation potentials become large at small scales and destroy the agreement of the perturbative and exact result .",
    "indeed , we find that the series of multiple insertions is very slowly converging at small scales .",
    "we therefore learn the important lesson that the `` correct '' choice of scale in the perturbative approach is @xmath229gev , while choosing smaller scales would lead to misleadingly large uncertainties .",
    "the lower plot of figure  [ fig : cs_order ] indicates that the scale dependence is less than @xmath190 , similar in size to the truncation error estimated above .",
    "this discussion does not include the unknown third - order non - coulomb corrections , but it lends support to the optimistic interpretation that the magnitude of the @xmath230 threshold cross section can eventually be computed with an accuracy of a few percent .",
    "we computed the third - order corrections from the strong interaction coulomb potential to the energy levels and the wave functions at the origin of the @xmath0-waves bound states , and to the expectation value of the @xmath0-wave green function operator in the @xmath231 state .",
    "we view this as a first step towards a complete calculation of the third - order top quark pair production cross section @xmath196 near threshold .",
    "it also completes the expression for the @xmath0-wave quarkonium masses with accuracy @xmath69 for arbitrary principal quantum number @xmath1 , except for the unknown constant @xmath5 in the coulomb potential .",
    "we updated the determination of the bottom quark mass from the mass of the @xmath147 and obtain @xmath232 for the ps mass , with almost no modification compared to the second - order analysis @xcite .",
    "our numerical study of the coulomb corrections to the top quark pair production cross section near threshold shows that the perturbative approach ( mandatory once non - coulomb corrections are included ) works and led to the conclusion that the residual uncertainty from the coulomb corrections is less than @xmath190 .",

    "<S> we obtain analytic expressions for the third - order corrections due to the strong interaction coulomb potential to the @xmath0-wave green function , energy levels and wave functions at the origin for arbitrary principal quantum number @xmath1 . together with the known non - coulomb correction this results in the complete spectrum of @xmath0-states up to order @xmath2 . the numerical impact of these corrections on the upsilon spectrum and the top quark pair production cross section near threshold is estimated .    </S>",
