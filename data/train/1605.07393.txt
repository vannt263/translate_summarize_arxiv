    "the revival interest of multinucleon transfer between actinide nuclei at low - energy collisions , such as two @xmath1u , has arisen .",

    "the initial condition of reaction , such as the properties of projectile and target nuclei , is of vital importance for the microscopic transport model .",
    "we check the binding energy , the root - mean - square radius and the deformation of the initial nuclei , as well as their time evolution carefully . only those initially selected nuclei with no spurious particle emission and their properties , such as the binding energy , root - mean - square radius and deformation being stable within 1000fm / c are adopted .",
    "the orientations of the initial uranium nuclei in all events are sampled randomly with an equal probability . in the imqmd model , the time evolution of the reaction for each event at different impact parameters can be tracked .",

    "the predicted produced light uranium - like elements with @xmath40 92 , we find that they can reach the border of the proton - rich side of known nuclei in the nuclear map . because of the high fission barrier , the light uranium - like primary fragments can survive against fission more easily and de - excite through neutron evaporation leading to the production of proton - rich nuclei .",

    "it shows that the outgoing angles of primary fragments around ( 114,184 ) are within @xmath43 .      the calculated production cross sections for the residual fragments emitted at angle regions @xmath7=0@xmath4 - 10@xmath4, ...",

    "the dotted lines denote the position of the heaviest actinide element lr ( @xmath0=103 ) . after the de - excitation process ,",
    "the production cross sections for superheavy nuclei around the island of stability are smaller than 10@xmath39 mb .",
    "it is noted from the figure that the outgoing angles of unknown actinide and transactinide isotopes are around @xmath7=0@xmath4 - 60@xmath4 and 40@xmath4 - 50@xmath4 , respectively .      in order to further investigate the contribution to the production of residual fragments from different outgoing angles shown in fig.[residual - angle - known ] and the production mechanism of unknown neutron - rich nuclei ,",
    "we take the unknown uranium isotopes with @xmath5 244 as an example .",
    "the calculated angular distribution of residual fragments of uranium with @xmath5 244 is shown in fig.[unknown - u - angle ] . here",
    "the star symbols denote the total angular distribution of residual fragments of uranium with mass number @xmath5 244 and the contributions from the reactions within different impact parameter intervals are shown with the lines with different color and different symbols . for the reactions at the impact parameters @xmath44 6 fm , a double - hump distribution is observed , the left hump with smaller outgoing angles corresponds to the residues produced from the target - like primary fragments and the right ones with larger outgoing angles come from the projectile - like primary fragments . with the increasing of impact parameters , the width of the angular distribution for each hump decreases , and the peak of the left hump shifts from an angle of less than 10@xmath4 to about 32.5@xmath4 , while that of the right hump shifts from about 52.5@xmath4 to 47.5@xmath4 and the shift is much smaller compared with that of the left one .",
    "the total angular distribution of the residues by adding up the contributions from all impact parameters becomes flat with a wide hump around 30@xmath4 - 55@xmath4 , which is the superposition of the contributions from projectile - like and target - like primary fragments .",
    "the hump part of the angular distribution mainly comes from the reactions at impact parameters @xmath26=4 - 8 fm .        in order to track the origin of the two - hump behavior shown in fig.[unknown - u - angle ] , we further study the dependence of average excitation energies @xmath45 of primary fragments of uranium with @xmath5 244 and the average lifetime @xmath46 of composite system formed in the corresponding events on the outgoing angles and impact parameters . in fig.[excit - energy - time - u ] , the @xmath45 and the @xmath46 are taken for the primary fragments in a small interval of outgoing angles @xmath47=1@xmath4 and from the reactions within an impact parameter interval @xmath48=0.15 fm . in fig.[excit - energy - time - u ] ( a ) and ( b ) , one can find that the primary fragments of uranium with @xmath5 244 are separated into two branches in both panels : the upper one consists of the projectile - like primary fragments and the lower one consists of target - like primary fragments . and there",
    "also exists a correspondence between the excitation energy of primary fragments and the life time of corresponding composite system , i.e. the longer the lifetime of the composite system is , the higher the excitation energy of the primary fragments produced from the composite system is .",
    "further , the low excitation energy area of @xmath6 30 mev ( the blue area ) in panel ( a ) coincides with the area with short lifetime area of 200 - 400fm / c ( the light blue area ) in panel ( b ) .",
    "relating fig.[excit - energy - time - u ] ( a ) and ( b ) to fig.[unknown - u - angle ] , we can obtain a scene that most of the residual fragments of uranium with @xmath5 244 are produced among the reaction events , in which two uranium nuclei bombarding with impact parameters @xmath26=4 - 8 fm contact with each other for about 200 - 400 fm / c and then the composite system re - separate .",
    "another example is the production of unknown isotopes of rutherfordium ( @xmath0=104 ) with @xmath5 269 for investigating the production mechanism of unknown neutron - rich transactinide nuclei .",
    "fig.[excit - energy - time - u ] ( c ) and ( d ) show the average excitation energies of primary fragments with @xmath49 and @xmath5 269 and the average lifetimes of their corresponding transient composite systems as the function of impact parameters and outgoing angles . the same as in panels ( a ) and ( b ) , in fig.[excit - energy - time - u ] ( c ) and ( d )",
    "the primary fragments are also separated into two branches corresponding to projectile - like and target - like primary fragments , respectively .",
    "but if comparing these two panels with ( a ) and ( b ) more carefully , we can find large difference between the production of unknown rutherfordium isotopes ( @xmath5 269 ) and that of unknown uranium isotopes ( @xmath5 244 ) . for the rf case , because of a large number of nucleons ( 12 protons and over 19 neutrons ) being transferred , the collision time between projectile and target become much longer as is seen from panel ( d ) , where the shortest collision time is 400fm / c .",
    "thus the average excitation energies of primary fragments are all larger than 30 mev .",
    "moreover the reactions at larger impact parameter have much less contribution compared with the case of the production of unknown uranium isotopes .",
    "eventually , it leads to a very small cross section for the residual fragments of rf with @xmath5 269 .",
    "the outgoing angles of rutherfordium primary fragments are smaller compared with those of uranium primary fragments with @xmath5 244 due to the longer collision time of composite system ( because of the rotation of the composite system ) . from",
    "fig.[residual - angle - known ] , one sees that the production cross sections for the residual fragments of rf with @xmath5 269 are lower than 10@xmath50 mb and the outgoing angles are in a narrow interval of 40@xmath4 - 50@xmath4 . from",
    "fig.[residual - angle - known ] , fig.[excit - energy - time - u](c ) and fig.[excit - energy - time - u](d ) , we can deduce that those residues of rf come from such kind of reaction events , in which the projectile - like fragments capturing a large number of nucleons from target bring a relatively larger collective kinetic energy ( i.e. relatively lower excitation energies ) and exit with laboratory angles around @xmath7=40@xmath4 - 50@xmath4 .",
    "from these two examples , we can learn that for the unknown neutron - rich uranium residues , both projectile - like and target - like primary fragments with low excitation energies of @xmath51 mev provide the comparable contributions and thus the residual fragments have a wider angular distribution of @xmath7=30@xmath4 - 60@xmath4 .",
    "as the number of transferred protons and neutrons increases , the collision time between projectile and target needed increases for the corresponding reaction events and the excitation energies of primary fragments become higher .",
    "eventually , the production cross section for the residues of rf decreases quickly and the outgoing angle of residues becomes narrower .",
    "it is because the outgoing angles of residual fragments from projectile - like primary fragments decrease due to the rotation of the composite system .      in this work",
    "we apply the improved quantum molecular dynamics ( imqmd ) model incorporated with the statistical evaporation model ( the hivap code ) to study the reaction @xmath1u+@xmath1u at 7.0 mev / nucleon .",
    "the calculation results of the production cross sections for the primary and residual fragments with charge number from @xmath0=70 to 120 are presented .",
    "about sixty unknown neutron - rich isotopes from element ra ( @xmath0=88 ) to db ( @xmath0=105 ) with the production cross sections above the lower bound of 10@xmath39 mb among the residual fragments produced in the reaction are predicted .",
    "the outgoing angles of primary and residual fragments are also investigated .",
    "we find that for most of the unknown neutron - rich isotopes around uranium , the outgoing angles are in a wider range of @xmath7=30@xmath4 - 60@xmath4 , while for those of heavier transactinide isotopes of rf the outgoing angles are in a narrower range of 40@xmath4 - 50@xmath4 . in order to understand the production mechanism of unknown neutron - rich isotopes , we study the impact parameter dependence of the excitation energies of primary fragments of uranium isotopes with @xmath5 244 and that of rutherfordium isotopes with @xmath5 269 and the lifetimes of their corresponding composite systems . we find that for the former case the collision time between two uranium nuclei is shorter and the primary fragments producing those residual fragments have low excitation energies of @xmath51 mev and their outgoing angles covers a wider range of 30@xmath4 - 60@xmath4 . and for the later case the longer collision time is needed for the transfer of a large number of nucleons and thus it results in the higher excitation energies and smaller outgoing angles of primary fragments and eventually results in a very small production cross sections and a narrower outgoing angle range of 40@xmath4 - 50@xmath4 for the residual fragments of rf with @xmath5 269 .",
    "this study should be useful for us to select the suitable projectile and target to produce the unknown heavy neutron - rich isotopes .",
