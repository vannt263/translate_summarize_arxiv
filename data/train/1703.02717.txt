    "recent progress of optical clocks based on neutral atoms in optical lattices and on single ions in rf traps has led to fractional uncertainties of 10@xmath2 level@xcite . various implementation with different atomic species",
    "are being explored to reach and/or to reduce these uncertainties .",
    "it is pointed out that measurement of frequency ratio of different optical clocks is an essential step towards the redefinition of the second@xcite .",
    "the ratio measurement is of crucial importance also for testing the temporal variation of the fundamental physical constants@xcite . in the implementation with single ions ,",
    "the optical frequencies have been reported so far with @xmath3yb@xmath1@xcite , @xmath4sr@xmath1@xcite , @xmath5ca@xmath1@xcite , @xmath6hg@xmath1@xcite , @xmath7al@xmath1@xcite , @xmath0in@xmath1@xcite .",
    "in@xmath1 is assumed to be a promising candidate of the original single - ion optical clock proposed by dehmelt@xcite , and frequency measurements with fractional uncertainties in 10@xmath8 level have been reported previously@xcite .",
    "however , there has been no update since 2007 in contrast to other ions reporting repeated improvements in the level below 10@xmath9 .",
    "frequency discrepancy of about 1  khz by two research groups remains also unresolved@xcite .",
    "recent theoretical prediction of small black body radiation ( bbr ) shift revives the advantage of in@xmath1 as an ion of the iiia group@xcite .",
    "frequency measurement of in@xmath1 with more precision than those of previous reports will make in@xmath1 a useful candidate of the frequency ratio measurement .",
    "it should be also noted that in@xmath1 is a promising candidate of the multi - ion optical clock with enhanced stability @xcite . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate spectroscopy of the in@xmath1 clock transition in a new approach based on sympathetic cooling , and report its frequency measurement using a local frequency reference , utc(nict ) ( realization of universal coordinated time at nict ) and a sr optical lattice clock .     optical clock .",

    "( c ) schematic drawing of the ion chain configurations for our new approach . ]",
    "the ion - based optical clock requires methods of cooling and of state detection in addition to the access to the clock transition .",
    "the @xmath10s@xmath11-@xmath10p@xmath12 transitions to provide the two methods in the iiia group ions are located in the vacuum ultraviolet range , and technical difficulties to prepare the single - mode light sources prevent the implementation of the optical clocks .",
    "this difficulty has been resolved by quantum logic spectroscopy ( qls ) of al@xmath1 , in which another ion is used for the cooling and the detection@xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of the qls is high technical demands for the cooling to the ground state of motion , and repeated detection for fidelity state readout .",
    "in@xmath1 has an exceptional feature as an iiia group ion that the @xmath10s@xmath11-@xmath13p@xmath12 transition can supply direct state detection and laser cooling owing to its relatively large linewidth of 360 khz as shown in fig.[concept](a ) .",
    "this feature was employed to direct quantum state detection@xcite , and to bichromatic laser cooling@xcite .",
    "the bichromatic laser cooling requires two laser frequencies to stabilize the cooling .",
    "the previous implementations of the in@xmath1 optical clock rely on these methods@xcite .",
    "we demonstrate a new approach , which combines the concepts of sympathetic cooling used in qls , and of the direct state detection in the previous in@xmath1 optical clocks@xcite .",
    "choice of ca@xmath1 as shown in fig .",
    "[ concept](b ) provides an easier access to cooling using compact diode - laser - based systems @xcite .",
    "when doppler cooling is applied to a ca@xmath1 , a sympathetically cooled in@xmath1 can be prepared in a simpler way than by bichromatic cooling .",
    "the direct quantum state detection of the in@xmath1 allows an easier implementation of the optical clock than by qls .",
    "although the frequency inaccuracy achieved ultimately with this approach is limited by the doppler cooling limit temperature of ca@xmath1 , the sideband cooling to the ground state using the @xmath14s@xmath15-@xmath14d@xmath16 clock transition could be used to reduced the inaccuracy by time dilation@xcite .",
    "the ca@xmath1 can be used also as a probe for the trapping and surrounding fields .",
    "the use of the @xmath14s@xmath15-@xmath14p@xmath15 transition with a larger scattering rate provides a fast evaluation of micromotion and the magnetic field .",
    "more precise field evaluation might be implemented by using the clock transition .",
    "the minimum configuration for the sympathetic cooling is to add one ca@xmath1 .",
    "however , asymmetric application of the trapping field is necessary to locate the in@xmath1 at the same site in this configuration .",
    "it is essential to place the ion at the same site to avoid location - dependent systematic shifts .",
    "use of two ca@xmath1 ions instead of one enables a symmetric configuration depicted as ( i ) in fig.[concept](c ) .",
    "this configuration is very convenient for the clock transition spectroscopy , because it is relatively easily recovered whenever it changes into the configuration ( ii ) .",
    "the recovery was demonstrated with amplitude modulation on the cooling laser to destabilize the configuration ( ii ) only@xcite . in the present study",
    "we use an even simpler method to reduce the trapping rf voltage until the heavier ion comes back to the center .",
    "the configuration ( ii ) with a ca@xmath1 at the center might be used for probing the electromagnetic field at the center for more precise systematic shift evaluation in future . for these practical advantages we use an ion chain consisting of one in@xmath1 and two ca@xmath1 .",
    "we demonstrate spectroscopy of the clock transition using such an ion chain for the first time .",
    "the overview of the experimental setup is shown in fig . [ setup ] .",
    "a linear rf trap is fabricated with becu plates with gold plating on both surfaces to avoid charging due to the deep uv beams .",
    "two dc electrodes are segmented in three parts to supply confinement along the trap axis , while two rf electrodes have short slits as shown in fig .",
    "[ concept](c ) .",
    "the distance from the trap center to the electrode edge is 0.5  mm , and the width of the center dc electrode is 3  mm .",
    "the trap electrodes are fixed to insulators made of glass ceramic , and then attached to a support consisting of machined becu blocks installed in a octagon - shaped vacuum chamber made of non - magnetic stainless .",
    "the chamber with uv - grade sapphire windows is evacuated to a pressure below 10@xmath17  pa .",
    "the trap is driven with an rf frequency of 27  mhz and a dc with 500  v , which gives ca@xmath1 secular frequency of 4.0  mhz and 0.5  mhz for the radial and the axial directions respectively .",
    "these voltages give radial secular frequency of 1.4  mhz for in@xmath1 and in - phase mode frequency along the axial direction of 0.4 mhz for the configuration ( i ) , which bring the in@xmath1 in the lamb - dicke regime .      the light source system for ca@xmath1 consists of a 397-nm and a 866-nm extended - cavity diode lasers ( ecdls ) for laser cooling , and of a 423-nm ecdl , and a 380-nm diode laser for resonant photo ionization .",
    "spectral filtering with a filter cavity or a grating , and frequency stabilization using transfer cavity referenced to a frequency - stabilized he - ne laser are implemented to the 397-nm and 866-nm lasers @xcite .",
    "the light source system for in@xmath1 consists of a 411-nm ecdl for resonant photo - ionizaiton , a 230-nm source for detection and a 237-nm clock laser .",
    "the 230-nm radiation is generated by two - stage frequency doubling of an amplified 922-nm ecdl .",
    "the master laser is locked to a ule ( ultra low expansion ) cavity with a finesse of about 10,000 .",
    "about 200  mw of output from the amplifier is frequency - doubled twice , first in a periodically - poled lithium niobate ( ppln ) waveguide to 60  mw at 461  nm , then in a beta - barium borate ( bbo ) crystal placed in an enhancement cavity , to the final output of 1  mw at 230  nm .",
    "the 237  nm radiation for the clock transition is generated by two - stage frequency doubling of an amplified diode laser at 946  nm in a similar way , except the bulk ppln crystal in an enhancement cavity in the first stage instead of a waveguide .",
    "available output power at 237  nm is 15  mw .",
    "we stabilize the fundamental frequency of 946  nm to a high finesses ule cavity ( finesse 320,000 ) , and control the ule cavity at the measured zero - crossing temperature of 32.8  @xmath18c .",
    "the linear drift of the cavity resonance is substantially eliminated by an aom , to which counter - drifting frequency is introduced from a dds - based oscillator .",
    "this drift compensation suppressed the long - term drift below 0.05  hz / s .",
    "simultaneous detection of the two ion species is performed with an image - intensified ccd ( iccd ) camera for ca@xmath1 and a solar - blind photo - multiplier tube ( pmt ) with a quantum efficiency of 30% for in@xmath1 .",
    "the separate imaging of two wavelengths resolves the large chromatic aberration for 397 nm and 230 nm of the imaging lens with focal length of 50  mm and an effective aperture of 27  mm .",
    "the configuration of the ions is continuously monitored with the iccd camera , and is kept to the configuration  ( i ) .",
    "whenever the chain changes to the configuration  ( ii ) , the measurement is interrupted and the rf potential is lowered and then heightened for reordering the ions to ( i ) .",
    "this simple method of ion reordering relies on mass dependence of the pseudo potential , and is effective only when the heavier ion is placed to the center .",
    "details of the method will be reported elsewhere .",
    "spectroscopic data with the configuration ( ii ) are not recorded in the present experiments .",
    "the experimental procedure starts with optimization of the micromotion compensation voltages and the magnetic field using a single ca@xmath1 followed by loading of another ca@xmath1 and an in@xmath1 , then the spectra are recorded by scanning the clock laser frequency by acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) .",
    "the frequency of the clock laser is measured using an optical frequency comb during the spectrum measurement , and the clock transition frequency is determined after each measurement session by taking the average of the scan data .",
    "the stabilization of the clock laser to the transition was not yet implemented in the present study as the spectroscopy signal often falls unavailable due to the recurrent changes of ion configuration .",
    "the ca@xmath1 is loaded by resonant photo - ionization of thermal ca beam from an oven installed beneath the trap using the 423-nm and 380-nm lasers@xcite .",
    "the ion is laser - cooled with the 397-nm and 866-nm ecdls .",
    "the number of ca@xmath1 is adjusted to one for the optimization of the micromotion compensation voltages and the magnetic field .",
    "micromotion compensation for three directions is performed with the ca@xmath1 using the standard procedure based on the fluorescence - rf correlation technique @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field at the trap center is controlled by three pairs of coils orthogonally attached to the vacuum chamber .",
    "the coil currents to null the magnetic field are searched for by using the dark states formed in the @xmath14d@xmath19 state of ca@xmath1@xcite . by iterative minimization of the ca@xmath1 fluorescence with currents of each coil pair , a set of currents",
    "to minimize the magnetic field is found@xcite . after the optimization of the fields ,",
    "two ca@xmath1 are loaded in the similar way .",
    "the number of ca@xmath1 is adjusted to two by controlling the trap rf voltage@xcite . then an in@xmath1 is loaded by resonant photo - ionization with the 411-nm ecdl .",
    "the in@xmath1 is sympathetically cooled with the ca@xmath1 .",
    "the number of in@xmath1 is identified as dark sites in the iccd image , and is adjusted by ejecting extra in@xmath1 ions by controlling the trap rf voltage@xcite . by measuring the in - phase mode frequency of the chain , the final dark site is identified as in@xmath1 with the mass number of 115 .",
    "the quantum state detection of the in@xmath1 is performed using the pmt .",
    "only when the in@xmath1 is in the @xmath10s@xmath11 state the ion emits photons at 230  nm and gives detection of about 15 photons per 60  ms gate time with approximately 10@xmath20w of the 230-nm light .",
    "this count clearly distinguishes that from scattered light and the dark count of 3 , with a discrimination fidelity of about 90% .",
    "spectroscopy of the clock transition is performed by recording the excitation probability as a function of the aom frequency ( @xmath21 ) for scanning the clock laser frequency . in order to avoid shifts due to the lasers other than the clock laser ,",
    "the ca@xmath1 cooling lasers as well as the 230-nm in@xmath1 detection beam are blocked by mechanical shutters during the clock pulse irradiation periods .",
    "200 trials are made for a single @xmath21 to obtain the excitation probability in the following procedure .",
    "the first step is to prepare the in@xmath1 in the @xmath10s@xmath11 state in the configuration ( i ) .",
    "this is confirmed by the image on the iccd and the count of the pmt .",
    "then all laser beams are blocked by the shutters , and the 237-nm clock pulse for a duration of 20  ms illuminates the in@xmath1 .",
    "the clock laser power of about 1.1  @xmath20w before the shutter and the estimated spot size diameter 100  @xmath20 m at the trap center gives similar intensity as in the previous reports@xcite .",
    "after the clock pulse irradiation other lasers are turned on , and the quantum state of the in@xmath1 is determined by the 230-nm fluorescence for the detection period of 60  ms .",
    "the single cycle takes 100  ms on average including dead times of 0.8  ms to wait for the mechanical shutters to be settled and process time of about 20  ms by pc . while the shutter timings are precisely generated by a delay generator , the process time by pc fluctuates due to the non - real - time nature of the operating system . repeating this procedure typically 200 times the excitation probability for a single aom frequency @xmath22",

    "a we estimate the residual shift dependent linearly on @xmath34 with -912  hz / mt . the shift should be canceled at the zero magnetic field , but the measurements at low magnetic fields in session b , c show spectrum linewidths larger than 350  hz , which suggests that possible residual magnetic field in _ x_- and _ y_-directions is not smaller than 5  @xmath20 t .",

    "the second - order zeeman shift of in@xmath1 is known to be much smaller than those of other ions , and is given as 4.1@xmath46 hz / mt@xmath14@xcite , in which the square of the magnetic field @xmath47 includes contributions from the residual magnetic field and the alternating magnetic field due to unbalanced currents of the ion trap rf field .",
    "both contributions are estimated as much smaller than 0.1  hz . the ac - stark shift due to the clock laser beam",
    "is estimated by calculating the shifts of the @xmath10s@xmath11 and the @xmath13p@xmath11 states due to coupling to the energy levels listed in ref .",
    "we added uncertainty of 0.1 hz as the upper limit obtained by the calculation .",

    "the bbr shift of in@xmath1 is recognized as smaller than those of other optical clock candidates except al@xmath1 , and is estimated as 17  mhz at 300  k@xcite .",
    "the largest contribution in the temperature uncertainty comes from the rf electrodes continuously exposed to the rf drive .",
    "if we assume the temperature of the electrodes rises to as high as 200 @xmath18c , and the in@xmath1 ion sees the electrodes with 4@xmath48 solid angle , the bbr shift would be 0.1  hz . considering the actual solid angle much smaller and the electrode temperature not higher than this assumption , we estimate the bbr shift uncertainty smaller than 0.1  hz . the frequency shift due to the time dilation comes from the residual micromotion and secular motion of the in@xmath1 ion .",
    "the uncertainty by micromotion was estimated from the rf correlation signal using the single ca@xmath1 prior and after the frequency measurements in the standard method@xcite , and is estimated to be 0.4  hz . the rather large uncertainty comes from the low sensitivity of our rf correlation measurement of the radial direction ( @xmath49 in fig.[concept](c ) ) limited by small angle of one of the 397-nm laser beams , which could be improved in future by modifying the beam irradiation geometry .",
    "strict evaluation of the uncertainty due to residual secular motion by sideband spectra was not performed in the present study due to unavailability of a vacuum chamber port to probe the secular motion of in@xmath1 along all the directions .",
    "instead we estimated the worst case , in which vibrational wavepacket size of the ca@xmath1 is as large as the image on the iccd camera .",
    "the 3@xmath20 m rms size corresponds to the maximum rms velocity 5.7  m / s of in@xmath1 assuming the in - phase mode of the ion chain@xcite .",
    "this leads to the uncertainty of 0.7  hz . the gravitational shift is well characterized in other experiments done in the same floor of the laboratory building @xcite , and is 10.5  hz for in@xmath1 .",
    "the systematic shifts associated with the clock frequency scan is evaluated to be sufficiently small compared to other shifts .",
    "the clock transition frequency is determined to be 1  267  402  452  901  049.9  ( 6.9 )  hz from the measurements and the above discussions .",
    "figure [ f - comparison ] represents the comparison of the measured frequency with reported values . in the previous studies a methane - stabilized he - ne",
    "laser or a commercial cesium beam clock both calibrated at remote sites was used as a frequency reference @xcite .",
    "in contrast our measurement has been performed using two different frequency standards located in the same site , and , therefore , it presumably provides more reliable measurements .",
