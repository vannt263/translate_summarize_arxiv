    "the probability that the lamb and shepherd meet before the lamb goes over the precipice coincides with the _ splitting probability _ for the lamb to eventually reach the origin . in turn , this latter problem is equivalent to the splitting probability for unbiased diffusion that starts at @xmath10 to reach the left edge of an asymmetrically contracting cage , whose left and right edges are at @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , with @xmath3 and @xmath13 ( fig .",

    "the right boundary moves to the right at speed @xmath2 and the particle drifts to the right with speed @xmath7 in addition to its diffusion .",

    "let @xmath59 denote the position of the particle at time @xmath41 .",
    "we first compute the propagator @xmath60 for the particle in this cage , viz . , the probability for the particle to be at @xmath59 at time @xmath41 , by solving the forward fokker - planck equation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath61 with the initial and boundary conditions @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and with @xmath64 . here",

    "we now turn to our original question : what is the optimal strategy for the shepherd to catch her skittish lamb without driving it over the precipice ? in the shepherd s reference frame , the lamb approaches at speed @xmath7 while the precipice approaches at a higher speed @xmath2 .",
    "the probability to catch the lamb in this contracting cage is the splitting probability @xmath90 . what speed @xmath2 maximizes this splitting probability ?",
    "partial conclusions can be drawn by studying the limits of @xmath91 and @xmath92 . if @xmath93 , the splitting probability @xmath90 is a linear function of its initial position ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) @xmath94 the qualitative behavior of @xmath90 when @xmath92 can also be easily understood . in this limit ,",
