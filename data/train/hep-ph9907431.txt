    "the calculation of mass - dependent radiative corrections is complicated but can be performed to a large extent by using computer algebra . in recent years",
    "many algorithms have been developed and huge program packages were elaborated for this purpose ( for a review of existing packages see ref.@xcite ) . due to different mass scales of the particles in the standard model the method of asymptotic expansion @xcite - the expansion of feynman diagrams w.r.t .",
    "the ratio of different scale parameters - is becoming more and more popular .",
    "the calculation of radiative corrections to low energy processes e.g. , in particular those with light external fermions , in many cases reduces to the calculation of self - energy diagrams with external momentum at different scales .",
    "this is one of the reasons why the evaluation of two - loop self - energy diagrams is worth special attention . from the point of view of approximation methods",
    "two - loop self - energy diagrams can be divided into several classes :    * only one non - zero mass enters internal lines and the external momentum is on the same mass shell .",

    "a general recipe of reduction of arbitrary two - loop self - energy diagrams to a set of master integrals has been suggested by tarasov @xcite .",
    "the algorithm was implemented in form and then in mathematica @xcite . however",
    ", this method suffers from the drawback that in processing the reduction of scalar master integrals with shifted dimension to the generic dimension of space - time , powers of @xmath0 may arise which require the expansion of master integrals as series in @xmath1 , which is a difficult task .",

    "we present a form @xcite based package that allows to calculate arbitrary two - loop self energy diagrams with one non - zero mass and the external momentum on the ( nonvanishing ) mass shell .",
