    "nowadays it is a well established fact that according to the einstein theory of gravity @xmath3 of the mass and energy in the universe is in a strange form with unusual properties inconsistent with any type of matter known to us .",
    "it is generally called _ dark energy _ ( see e.g.  @xcite for recent reviews ) . in the last two decades or so numerous models",
    "have been suggested to explain this mysterious and dominant constituent of the universe .",
    "the majority of these theories can be classified in one the following three categories : 1 ) models based on a scalar field e.g. quintessence  @xcite and its variants such as k - essence  @xcite in which the kinetic term in the lagrangian has a non - standard form , and varying neutrino mass models  @xcite in which the accelerating expansion of the universe is generated by the variation of neutrinos mass due to their interaction with a light scalar field ; 2 ) modified gravity models in which dark energy is explained as the deviation of gravitational interaction from einstein theory of gravity .",
    "examples of such models include scalar - tensor  @xcite and @xmath4 gravity  @xcite , chameleon  @xcite , and dgp  @xcite ; 3 ) a cosmological constant - introduced by einstein himself  @xcite and interpreted by lematre as the energy density of vacuum  @xcite .",
    "it is phenomenologically the simplest of three categories , and is still the best fit to all observational data  @xcite .",
    "however , naive estimations of vacuum energy are @xmath5 to @xmath6 orders of magnitude larger than the observed dark energy  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , alternative explanations have been explored even before the observation of the accelerating expansion of the universe  @xcite .",
    "the main task of cosmologists today is discriminating between these models , in particular distinguishing the first two categories mentioned above from a cosmological constant .",
    "a notable difference between a cosmological constant and some of alternative models is the presence of a weak interaction between matter and dark energy .",
    "pure quintessence models , in which there is no interaction between the scalar field and matter are somehow pathological because all known fundamental particles , including neutrinos which have very small couplings , interact non - gravitationally with some other particles .",
    "even axiomatic weakly coupled particles such as axions  @xcite are expected to interact with gauge bosons such as gluons .",
    "fields in candidate extensions of the standard model are related to each others by symmetries , thus either by gauge interaction or by mass mixing . on the other hand , if a field such as quintessence interacts only with gravity , then naturally it should be considered to belong to the gravity sector .",
    "an example of such fields is dilaton which was first introduced in the context of kaluza - klein model for the unification of gravity and electromagnetic forces  @xcite , and is also associated with conformal gravity models , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "but gravity is a universal force and interacts with all other particles .",
    "thus , in contradiction with the assumption above , the quintessence field must have an interaction with other particles .",
    "in fact dilaton does have non - minimal interaction with other species , see for instance  @xcite .",
    "this makes the task of finding a candidate for a non - interacting quintessence field very difficult .",
    "a more problematic issue with pure quintessence models is the fact that they do not solve the coincidence problem of dark energy , i.e. why it becomes dominant only at late times and after galaxy formation .",
    "interacting quintessence models in which the quintessence field has a weak interaction with some matter species , in particular with dark matter , can solve or at least soften the huge fine - tuning of dark energy density with respect to matter in the early universe  @xcite .    in modified gravity models",
    "the deviation from the einstein theory of gravity can be , either written explicitly , or presented by introducing new fields , usually scalars , in the matter sector . the first presentation is called _ jourdan frame _ and the second _",
    "einstein frame_. because in the latter case the model looks very similar to an interacting quintessence model , it is necessary to find a proper definition that discriminates between what is called _ modified gravity _ and what is called _ interacting quintessence_. in modified gravity , the scalar field is usually related to a dilaton field , thus it has a geometrical origin and arises from a broken conformal symmetry  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the scalar field always interacts with the trace of energy - momentum tensor of matter  @xcite .",
    "the situation is not so straightforward for interaction between matter and scalar field in interacting quintessence models for which various types of interactions are considered in the literature , see for instance  @xcite . in many of these models in analogy with modified gravity , in particular @xmath4 models ,",
    "the interaction term is considered to be proportional to the trace of the energy - momentum tensor of matter , when we talk about the interaction term , we mean the modification of energy - momentum conservation equation due to an interaction . ] .    in this work",
    "we try to determine the interaction between dark matter and dark energy in a collisional description of interactions inspired by particle physics . using the boltzmann equation with a collisional term and some results from studies of the microphysics of dark energy condensate  @xcite",
    ", we show that the interaction can be described only approximately by spacetime dependent functions , and in general one needs the distribution in the phase space @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the 4-momentum , see sec .",
    "[ sec : interact ] for more details .",
    "however , at present and for foreseeable future , we can not observe the phase space distribution of dark energy .",
    "considering this fact , we use thermodynamical description of average energy - momentum and velocity to obtain approximate covariant expressions for interactions between matter and a scalar field as dark energy .",
    "this leads to a modification of energy - momentum conservation equation which explicitly deviates from modified gravity .",
    "their difference can be used as a mean for classifying models and discriminating these two categories in the data .    on the observational side , one has to find the best way of parametrizing cosmological evolution equations such that they admit discrimination between at least the three major categories of models discussed above . in preference",
    "they should not depend on the details which are neither well understood nor can be targeted with the precision of present and near future surveys .",
    "observations show that dark energy has negligible clustering ( see e.g.  @xcite for latest results ) . therefore , its dominant contribution is in the homogeneous component of the einstein and conservation equations .",
    "it also affects the evolution of anisotropies mainly through their dependence on the background cosmology . for this reason , irrespective of the way we measure the equation of state of dark energy - from observations of supernovae that are only sensitive to background cosmology , or from observations of matter perturbations by measuring lensing or galaxy distribution - we must extract parameters of background cosmology to determine the contribution of dark energy .",
    "consequently , it is crucial to understand how different models affect this component through a proper parametrization that facilitates the discrimination between various models .",
    "this is another goal of the present work .",
    "although there are few popular parametrizations  @xcite in the literature , specially for testing modification of the einstein theory of gravity at large scales , as we will show in this work , they are not suitable for discriminating between modified gravity and ( interacting)-quintessence models .",
    "we should remind that for @xmath0cdm model the growth rate @xmath9 is roughly scale independent .",
    "therefore , observation of the violation of this property would be a clear signature of inconsistency with standard cosmology .",
    "but the measurement of @xmath9 and the expansion rate @xmath10 by themselves are not enough for discriminating between modified gravity , quintessence , and interacting quintessence , and a parametrization that does not depend on the details of these models is necessary to highlight their differences .",
    "evidently , one can simply fit the data with models and compare their goodness of fit .",
    "but , this does not take into account the degeneracies and similarities",
    ". therefore , a smart parametrization and better data analysing methods are necessary . moreover , the fact that most popular modified gravity models can be formulated as an scalar field theory means that their differences from ( interacting)-quintessence must be understood and the parametrization must be performed in a way that it highlights these differences and help discrimination .    in this work",
    "we propose a new set of parameters to describe , in a model independent way , the effect of an interacting dark energy on the evolution of the expansion rate of the universe and another set of parameters for the growth rate .",
    "these quantities are the most sensitive measurables for discriminating between dark energy models .",
    "consequently , the ultimate goal of various measurement methods is to constrain cosmological and dark energy models by measuring one or both these quantities .",
    "for instance , galaxy distribution and lensing surveys determine the power spectrum of fluctuations for one or multiple redshift bins .",
    "future large surface and sensitive spectroscopic surveys such as euclid allow to determine the matter power spectrum for a statistically significant number of redshift bands , and thereby extract the growth rate , see e.g.  @xcite for the methodology applied to the wigglez dark energy survey .",
    "the bao measurements determine the expansion rate and angular diameter distance at one or multiple redshift bins , and can thereby estimate variation of these quantities .",
    "supernovae data measure the expansion rate directly , and the variation of @xmath11 can be extracted .",
    "therefore , parametrizations that we will discuss here are relevant for all measurement methods in cosmology .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : frieman ] we present a new parametrization for friedman equation in the context of a general interacting dark energy model . in ref .",
    "@xcite we defined a quantity @xmath12 and proposed it for the measurement of the equation of state of dark energy defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are pressure and energy density of dark energy respectively .",
    "it is specially suitable for measuring the deviation from a cosmological constant , see appendix [ app : a ] for the definition of @xmath16 and a review of its properties .",
    "in addition , we argued that in what concerns the sign of @xmath17 ( see equation ( [ gammade ] ) below for its definition ) , this quantity has distinct geometrical properties which make it less sensitive to uncertainties of other quantities such as @xmath18 or @xmath19 , respectively the present value of hubble constant and the density fraction of matter .",
    "the sign of @xmath17 is the discriminator between what is called phantom models which have @xmath20 , and normal scalar fields ( quintessence ) models and a cosmological constant for which @xmath21 .    using this parametrization and properties of @xmath16",
    ", we show that in presence of an interaction between dark energy and other components , one obtains different estimation for @xmath22 ( see next section for its definition ) from @xmath11 and from @xmath23 when data is analyzed with the null hypothesis of a @xmath0cdm model as dark energy . in this way one can predict the sensitivity of surveys to interacting dark energy models in a model - independent manner .",

    "[ sec : interact ] we describe phenomenological interactions for interacting quintessence models and compare it with modified gravity .",

    "[ sec : perturb ] we present evolution equations of over - density and velocity fields in each category of models for the interactions obtained in sec .",
    "[ sec : interact ] .",
    "then we describe how one can discriminate between interacting quintessence and modified gravity models by using matter power spectrum and its evolution , i.e. the growth rate of anisotropies . because the growth rate plays a special role in the discrimination between various dark energy models , in sec .",
    "[ sec : forecast ] we parametrize its evolution , and as an example of application , we obtain an order of magnitude estimate for the discrimination ability of the euclid mission  @xcite that measures both parameters of the homogeneous component ( the background cosmology ) and the evolution of growth rate of matter anisotropies .",
    "in addition , we compare our parametrization with other parametrizations that can be found in the literature which are usually designed to test the einstein theory of gravity .",
    "conclusions and outlines are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : outline ] .",

    "[ app : d ] we calculate an approximate analytical solution for the growth rate of matter anisotropies .    here",
    "we must emphasize that the predictions for future missions obtained in this work are only representative and order of magnitude estimations of what is expect from future surveys .",
    "they should be considered as a _",
    "_ ( quick and dirty ) , hand - shaking predictions .",
    "their purpose is only to show that it is possible to measure the new parameters with reasonable uncertainties .",
    "a proper prediction for future observation projects needs detailed consideration of instrumental response , simulation of data analysing procedure , and understanding of the sources of systematic and statistical errors .",
    "fulfilling these requests necessitates a dedicated investigation which is out of the scope of the present work that targets theoretical issues related to the discrimination between various dark energy models .",
    "in fact , a number of authors have performed predictions for uncertainties of various measured quantities by future missions , see for instance  @xcite .",
    "they usually consider models that can be classified as modified gravity according to the classification criteria discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : interact ] .",
    "nonetheless , some of their parameters can be related to quantities defined in this work , thus their predictions can be used to obtain a rough estimation for the expected uncertainties for the new parameters .    throughout this work we use einstein frame for modified gravity models unless it is explicitly specified . in this way",
    ", a unified description can be made for all interacting dark energy models based on a scalar field formulation .",
    "apriori the measurement of the equation of state of dark energy is simple .",
    "it is enough to measure the expansion rate of the universe @xmath26 , or a quantity related to it such as the luminosity distance @xmath27 at different redshifts .",
    "then , by modeling known constituents of the universe as non - interacting perfect fluids , one can fit the data and measure the effective equation of state of dark energy @xmath28 , defined as @xmath29 .",
    "the suffix _",
    "`` eff '' _ is used to remind that pressures and densities obtained in this way can be effective quantities rather than physical pressure and density of constituents , because we have neglected any interaction between components .",
    "therefore , from now on _ effective quantities _ mean quantities determined from data by considering a null hypothesis .    in practice",
    "however the life is not so simple .",
    "the density of a perfect fluid changes with redshift as @xmath30 ( @xmath31 is defined in ( [ gammade ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , at low redshifts when @xmath32 , the total density is not very sensitive to the value of @xmath31 or equivalently @xmath25 and their variation with @xmath33 , see appendix [ app : a ] for more details .",
    "this statement is independent of the type of data or proxy used for determining @xmath11 or @xmath27 . on the other hand , at high redshifts where @xmath11 is more sensitive to the equation of state ,",
    "dark energy is subdominant .",
    "moreover , it is more difficult to measure @xmath11 and @xmath27 at higher redshifts and measurement uncertainties can make the estimation of @xmath25 and its evolution unusable for discrimination between models .",
    "if constituents of the universe do not interact with each other , friedman equation which determines the evolution of expansion function @xmath34 can be written as : & & = = _ m ( 1+z)^3 + _ h ( 1+z)^4 + _ k ( 1+z)^2 + _ de ( 1+z)^3(z ) , [ friedmannoint ] + & & ( z ) = _ 0^z dz , p_de ( z ) w(z ) _ de [ gammade ] + & & in this class of models matter and radiation densities evolve only due to the expansion .",
    "this is a good approximation for all redshifts @xmath35 .    in interacting dark energy models matter and radiation terms in the right hand side of the friedman equation ( [ friedmannoint ] )",

    "i f_i(z ) ( 1+z)^3_i i= [ friedmanintde ] without lack of generality we assume that @xmath36 and all redshift dependent terms are included in @xmath17 . in quintessence models",
    "the coefficient of the curvature term also is constant because it is assumed to be related to geometry / gravity and independent of the behaviour of other components . at present observations are consistent with only gravitational interaction between various components in ( [ friedmanintde ] ) , thus additional interactions must be very weak . by definition and without lack of generality",
    "we consider @xmath37 .",
    "observations also show that @xmath38 , therefore throughout this work we assume @xmath39 unless it is explicitly mentioned .",
    "note that in the case of modified gravity models , a parametrization similar to ( [ friedmanintde ] ) can be defined both in einstein and jordan frames .",
    "a simple example for which an approximate expression for @xmath40 coefficients can be found is a model with a cosmological constant as dark energy and a slowly decaying dark matter .",
    "the decay remnants are assumed to be visible relativistic particles  @xcite . in this case : & & _ m ( 1 + z)^3 ( ) + _ b ( 1 + z)^3 + _ h ( 1 + z)^4 + _ m ( 1 + z)^4 ( 1 - ( ) ) + _ + & & [ totdens ] + & & f_m(t ) ( ) + ( 1+z ) ( 1 - ( ) ) , _ 0 , _ b = f_h = 1 ( z ) = 0 [ dmdecaycoeff ] where @xmath41 is the lifetime of dark matter and @xmath42 is the age of the universe .",
    "it is demonstrated that in this example , if the decay / interaction of dark matter is not considered in the data analysis , a @xmath43 can be obtained for dark energy , see  @xcite for more details about the set up and the proof .",
    "note that in ( [ dmdecaycoeff ] ) , we have included the contribution of relativistic remnants in @xmath44 .",
    "however , as this component has a redshift dependence similar to hot matter , it also makes sense to consider it as hot matter and add it to hot component .",
    "it is even possible to add this term to dark energy contribution , as long as it is small and induces only a slight deviation from a cosmological constant . in this case",
    ", one can show that the _ effective dark energy _ will have @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "the reason for such freedom is that we do not measure or take into account the decay remnants .",
    "this example clearly shows that parametrization ( [ friedmanintde ] ) is not unique when all the components and their interactions are not know .",
    "therefore , one has to be very careful about degeneracies when data are analyzed and interpreted .",
    "in particular , prior assumptions such as stability of matter and radiation components can affect measurements and conclusions .",

    "extension of this example to quintessence models without coupling to matter is straightforward and one simply needs to consider @xmath47 .",
    "a more interesting extension is to assume that the quintessence scalar field is one of the remnants of the decay of dark matter , which during cosmological time condensates and makes a classical quintessence field . in this case",
    ", it has been shown  @xcite that coefficients @xmath44 , @xmath48 , and equation of state of dark energy @xmath25 ( or equivalently @xmath17 ) are not independent .",

    "one way of measuring the presence of interaction without having to fit data to the large number of parameters in equations ( [ friedmanmgequiv ] ) and ( [ azintdmde ] ) , is to measure how different @xmath93 and @xmath94 are , because as we discussed in the previous section , when @xmath45 these effective quantities are not the same . to this end ,",

    "but , @xmath91 depends on @xmath25 or equivalently @xmath17 through an integral , see equation ( [ dah ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is less sensitive to the variation of @xmath17 with redshift .",
    "this is analogue to binning a data . evidently , a binned data is less noisy and has a smaller uncertainty .",
    "but , if the goal is to measure the variation of data , the binning can completely smear out small variations .",
    "therefore , irrespective of methods and measured proxies , we are limited by inherent properties of the physical system . in this respect ,",
    "the precision with which @xmath101 can be measured gives the ultimate sensitivity of an observation / data set to deviation from @xmath0cdm .",
    "in the previous section we used friedman equation for parametrizing interaction between matter and dark energy .",
    "evolution of their densities is ruled by energy - momentum conservation .",
    "but , in presence of non - gravitational interactions between constituents the energy - momentum tensor of each component @xmath105 is not separately conserved , and conservation equation can be only written for the total energy - momentum tensor @xmath106 defined as : & & t^ _",

    "in fact , equations in ( [ tqcons ] ) are inspired by perturbation theory in which for each perturbative order , the right hand sides of these equations are estimated by using quantities from one perturbative order lower .",
    "thus , they constitute an iterative set of equations from zero order ( free ) model in which @xmath113 , up to higher orders .",
    "this approach is not suitable for dark energy where we ignore , not only interactions but also the free model .",
    "therefore , a more general expression should be used : t^_m  ; = -q_m^ , t^ _  ; = -q_^ , t^_int  ; = q_m^+ q_^[tqmcons ] in these equations matter and dark energy tensors @xmath114 and @xmath115 have the same expression as in the absence of interaction , but with respect to fields which are not free .",
    "these expressions can be justified by considering the lagrangian of the model . in einstein frame",
    "the lagrangian for a weakly interacting system can be divided to free and interaction parts : = _",
    "i l_i + l_int [ ltot ] considering only local interactions , in the dynamics equations for the fields partial derivative of @xmath116 with respect to each field determines the interaction term .",
    "dynamic equations can be related to energy - momentum conservation equations ( [ tqcons ] )  @xcite .",
    "therefore , interaction currents @xmath117 and @xmath118 are generated by partial derivatives of @xmath116 with respect to the corresponding field .    in the previous section we explained that the scalar field in scalar - tensor modified gravity models is related to a dilaton .",
    "consequently , the interaction term is proportional to the trace of matter , see equation ( [ grgmener ] ) for an explicit example of @xmath4 models . in this case",
    "there is no interaction between scalar field and relativistic particles , and it can be shown that @xmath119  @xcite , i.e. @xmath120 and conservation equations in ( [ tqcons ] ) can be used .",
    "interaction current @xmath112 for these models can be written as : q^= c ( ) t_m ^[mgcurrent ] where @xmath121 . in @xmath1 models",
    "the coupling @xmath122 is a constant .",
    "here we consider @xmath123-dependence to cover more general cases .",
    "some authors have also considered @xmath124 for interacting quintessence models  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the interaction current of interacting dark energy models in literature is usually considered to be @xmath125 for cold dark matter i.e. similar to what is obtained for @xmath1 modified gravity models  @xcite .",
    "however , giving the fact that these models share some important properties with modified gravity models , such as the absence of interaction between relativistic matter and scalar field , we classify them in the modified gravity category .",
    "in fact , interactions in interacting quintessence models can be more diverse than this simple case . in the rest of this section",
    "we describe how they can be formulated without considering their details .    in the context of quantum field theory ,",
    "the lagrangian @xmath126 can be easily written for various types of fields and their interactions , see e.g.  @xcite . but these formulations are usually complicated , and are necessary if the microphysics of dark energy models is studied .",
    "there are various ways to write @xmath126 and/or @xmath106 with respect to macroscopic quantities which are apriori measurable from cosmological observations .",
    "for instance , one can use a fluid description for components .",
    "the lagrangian of a fluid is defined as  @xcite : & & l_f = ( p+ ) g _ u^u^+ ( p- ) g_g^ + g _ ^ [ lfluid ] + & & k + v , p k - v [ rhopdef ] where @xmath127 and @xmath128 are respectively kinetic and potential energy , and @xmath129 is the traceless shear tensor . note that if we impose the traceless condition on the lagrangian , the last term in the right hand side of equation ( [ lfluid ] ) becomes zero .",
    "therefore , this term must be considered as a lagrange multiplier , and traceless condition is imposed after determination of @xmath130  @xcite .",
    "it is easy to check that the lagrangian @xmath131 leads to the familiar expression for the energy - momentum tensor of a fluid : t^ , t^_f = ( + p ) u^u^- g^p + ^ [ tfluid ] transformation of a lagrangian written with respect to fields to a fluid description is easy , and one can determine the energy - momentum of interaction @xmath110 and the current @xmath112 defined in ( [ tqmcons ] ) directly and without any ambiguity , see appendix [ app : c ] .",
    "however , their descriptions as a function of density and pressure of the fluid depend on the self - interaction potential @xmath132 . for instance , a higgs - like interaction between a scalar and a fermion @xmath133 is described as @xmath134 if @xmath135 , and as @xmath136 if @xmath137 .",
    "therefore , when the objective is a general parametrization of interactions without considering details of the underlying model , this type of description is not very suitable .    a more serious problem of fluid description of interaction lagrangian is the fact that conservation equations in ( [ tqmcons ] ) are equivalent to field equations and can be obtained from them  @xcite .",
    "therefore , they do not contain quantum processes such as decay and scattering .",
    "it is well known that the boltzmann equation plays the role of intermediate between quantum and classical description of interacting systems  @xcite . in this case , components are defined by their phase space distribution @xmath138 where @xmath8 and @xmath139 are respectively momentum and spacetime coordinates .",
    "interactions are included as collision terms in the right hand side of the boltzmann equation  @xcite , from which one can obtain energy - momentum and number conservation equations directly : & & p^_f_i ( p , x ) - ^ _ p^p^ l[f_i ] = c_i(p , x ) [ boltzeq ] + & & n^ _ ; = d|p  c_i(p , x ) , d|p d^4p ( e^2 - ^2 - m_i^2 ) [ boltzn ] + & & t^_i  ; = d|p  p^c_i(p , x ) [ boltzt ] where @xmath140 is the number of internal degrees of freedom ( e.g. spin ) of species @xmath108 .",

    "the collisional terms are : c_m ( p , x ) & = & -_m m_m f_m(p , x ) - f_m(p , x ) d|p _",

    "the disadvantage of this approach is that it needs phase space distribution of components which is not always available , specially for dark energy .",
    "moreover , the absence of an explicit description for the lagrangian means that the total energy - momentum tensor needed for determining einstein equations and metric evolution , can be obtained only by solving equation ( [ boltzt ] ) for all components .",
    "these equations are differentio - integral and usually do nt have analytical solution .",
    "thus , in practice interacting models can be studied only numerically , otherwise one needs to consider some approximation .",
    "for instance , dark energy interaction with matter must be very weak .",
    "thus , @xmath147 .",
    "therefore , we can neglect its contribution in the total energy - momentum tensor and einstein equationscdm , one must be aware that in many models of this type , the approximation of weak interaction can be applied only at low redshifts .",
    "it is also expected that these models leave a detectable signature on the cmb spectrum  @xcite . ] . as for the integration of collision term in equations ( [ boltzn ] ) and ( [ boltzt ] ) , under some physically motivated assumptions",
    "they can be simplified and integrated .",
    "for instance , when dark matter is assumed to be an scalar , the expression for the scattering cross - section is very simple , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "it is simply proportional to the coupling constant and delta functions for energy - momentum conservation .",
    "it is expected that the mass of quintessence field be very small , specially much smaller than the mass of dark matter .",
    "the momentums of both components are also expected to be small . in this case their distribution at large momentums is strongly suppressed , and the cross - section around the peak of distribution can be considered to be approximately constant . under these simplifications , it is easy to see that scattering term in the right hand side of ( [ boltzt ] ) is proportional to integrals of the form : & & d|p_1  d|p_2  p_1^",
    "f_1(p_1,x )  f_2(p_2,x ) = n_1^d|p_2  f_2(p_2,x ) d|p_2  p_2^",

    "approximate expression for @xmath150 in ( [ urelate ] ) is valid when the distribution in momentum space is concentrated around a peak . using similar approximations the decay terms in the right hand side of ( [ boltzt ] )",
    "can be also described as a function of velocity and number vectors .",
    "finally , after grouping all the constant or approximately constant factors together , energy - momentum conservation equations for dark matter and dark energy can be written as : & & t^_m  ; -l_m n_m^+ a_ms n_m^u _ n_^ q_m^[tmconsmapprox ] + & & t^ _  ; l_n_m^+ a_s n_^ u_m n_m^q_^[tdeconsmapprox ] where constants @xmath151 and @xmath152 are decay width and scattering amplitude for species @xmath108 . in the rest of this work we use these equations as an approximation for energy - momentum conservation equations irrespective of dark matter type ( spin ) and details of interaction between two dark components .",
    "they affect constants @xmath151 and @xmath152 which are used as parameters .",
    "one can also add dark matter self - annihilation term to ( [ tmconsmapprox ] ) .",
    "but , it is easy to show that self - annihilation is proportional to @xmath153 .",
    "thus , it is significant only in dense regions i.e. at small spatial scales such as the central region of dark matter halos , which are in nonlinear regime and are not studied in the present work .",
    "here we only consider homogeneous and linear perturbations .",
    "therefore , the effect of annihilation is negligible .",
    "we remind that equation ( [ tmconsmapprox ] ) is not restricted to cold dark matter and can be also used for relativistic matter , for instance neutrinos in early universe , or a hot component at low redshifts .",
    "although in the rest of this work we consider the interaction terms described in this section , for what concerns the study of differences between modified gravity and interacting quintessence models , the formulation of anisotropies and discrimination methods explained in the next two sections can be applied to other choices of interactions .",

    "the reason is that we need @xmath184 , which in the phenomenological description of interactions is not known .",

    "we also consider @xmath301 . in this case after dividing equation ( [ growthratevol ] ) by @xmath302 , the evolution equation of growth rate becomes : + ( + 1 ) + ^2 +  _ m = 0 [ grwothtarelcdm ] after changing the variable from @xmath303 to @xmath304 , this equation changes to : + ( + 1 ) + ^2 +  _ m = 0 , x [ grwothtarelcdma ] by integrating the friedman equation for flat @xmath0cdm one obtains : & = & = x= [ mathh ] + e & = & = = [ hph2 ] for @xmath305 , @xmath306 and for @xmath307 , @xmath308 . to be able to solve ( [ grwothtarelcdma ] ) analytically we must assume @xmath309 is a constant .",
    "this is a good approximation if we are interested only on a small range of redshifts . under this assumption , the solution of ( [ grwothtarelcdma ] )",

    "a simple attempt to make ( [ fsol ] ) more precise is to take into account that @xmath309 depends on redshift .    to obtain an approximate solution for interacting dark energy models parametrized by coefficients @xmath300 in ( [ growthratevol ] ) , under the assumption that these corrections are small",
