    "the generation of non - classical states of photons @xcite represents a hot research topic of modern quantum optics and is vital for future applications .",
    "in particular , single photon emitters ( spes ) are of key importance in quantum communication @xcite , quantum metrology @xcite , and quantum information technologies @xcite , where strong anti - bunching of photons ( and sub - poissonian statistics ) is required .    at the same time",
    ", a possibility to induce non - classical behaviour of photons ultimately relies on the effective photon - photon interactions , which bring nonlinearity into otherwise linear optical systems .",
    "therefore , considering the typically small values of photon nonlinearity presently available , the search for an ideal system still persists @xcite .",
    "moreover , an issue of tunability often appears as a compulsory demand for future spes , accounting for the strong dependence of emission properties on the system parameters .",
    "examples of currently existing and recently proposed single photon emitters contain a large number of various nonlinear systems , spanning from cavity quantum electrodynamic ( cqed ) systems with a single atom @xcite or a quantum dot ( qd ) @xcite , photonic blockade by rydberg atoms @xcite , to four - level atomic systems @xcite , quantum optomechanical setups @xcite , confined cavity polaritons @xcite , and others @xcite .",
    "many of them depend on the strength of optical nonlinearity @xmath1 , accounting for the fact that large nonlinearity makes the photon energy spectrum non - equidistant , with consequent suppression of two photon state occupation .",
    "this effect was coined as photon blockade @xcite , given the similarity with electron blockade in quantum dot systems .",
    "however , an additional constraint is given by the cavity photon decay rate @xmath2 , demanding @xmath3 and posing the challenge of production of high finesse cavities or very large values of nonlinearity .",
    "an alternative unconventional photon blockade effect was recently proposed @xcite .",
    "the origin of anti - bunching there lies in quantum interference effects @xcite , and the condition @xmath3 is relaxed , while a small optical nonlinearity is still required for spe operation . with an initial system of interest corresponding to tunnel - coupled polaritonic micropillars @xcite , with significant experimental progress @xcite",
    "a number of studies reported similar effects in cqed systems with qds @xcite , coupled optomechanical cavities @xcite , doubly resonant microcavities @xcite or passive nonlinear cavities @xcite .",
    "other interesting proposals which also enable spe for modest values of nonlinearity include weakly coupled optomechanical systems with enhanced parametric interaction @xcite or critically coupled hybrid optomechanical systems @xcite .    here , we show that an unconventional photon blockade can be engineered in a dipolariton system @xcite , where direct exciton and indirect exciton @xcite transitions of a double quantum well ( qw ) are strongly coupled to each other , and direct excitons are",
    "additionally strongly coupled to a cavity mode of a zero - dimensional micropillar [ see sketch in fig .",
    "the emergent dipolariton quasiparticles were shown to be useful for the generation of thz radiation @xcite and enhancement of the nonlinear interparticle interaction due to its dipole - dipole nature @xcite .",
    "assuming low - intensity coherent pumping of the cavity mode , we perform master equation calculations and observe anti - bunching of photons originating from coherent coupling between the modes .",
    "we define the optimal parameters for the single photon emission using an ansatz wave function in a truncated fock space of the dipolariton system .",
    "finally , we show that the second order equal time correlation function of photons can be easily tuned via an applied electric field or tuning the pumping frequency .",
    "this enables on - the - flight change of spe properties necessary for future applications .",
    "we consider the system of a semiconductor micropillar  @xcite with a double quantum well embedded in the antinode of the optical resonator [ fig .",
    "1(a ) ] . the quantum wells ( qws )",
    "are strongly coupled via electronic tunneling @xmath4 , while the direct excitons from the left quantum well are additionally strongly coupled to the cavity mode ( c ) with rabi frequency @xmath5 .",
    "the detuning between indirect exciton ( ix ) and direct exciton ( dx ) levels can be conveniently tuned using external electric field @xmath6 .    .",
    "also , the applied electric field @xmath6 is tuned such that the direct exciton and indirect exciton modes are strongly coupled via tunneling with rate @xmath4 .",

    "here yellow ( @xmath5 ) and blue ( @xmath4 ) arrows correspond to linear couplings , red arrows ( @xmath7 ) denote weak optical pump , and @xmath8 are energy shifts due to nonlinearity . ]",
    "[ fig : sketch ]    the generic hamiltonian for the dipolariton system reads @xmath9 , and consists of coherent linear and nonlinear contributions .",
    "the linear part of the hamiltonian reads : @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are creation and annihilation operators for cavity photons , direct excitons and indirect excitons , respectively . here",
    "@xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the cavity mode , direct exciton and indirect exciton energies , and the first three terms of the hamiltonian describe the energy of the bare modes .",
    "the fourth and fifth terms correspond to the strong coupling between modes , where @xmath17 ( rabi splitting ) denotes the coupling constant between photons and direct excitons , and the tunnelling rate corresponding to dx  ix coupling is @xmath18 .",
    "the last two terms in the hamiltonian correspond to the optical pumping of the cavity mode with rate @xmath7 and frequency @xmath19 .",
    "the relevant processes given by the coherent linear couplings and nonlinear shifts are schematically depicted in fig .",
    "it is convenient to perform the unitary transformation @xmath20 , which redefines the overall energy scale and removes the time dependence of the pump term .",
    "the unitary operator reads @xmath21 $ ] , and it is useful to introduce the relevant detuning parameters @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 . implementing rotation ,",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath25 note that the photon - exciton detuning @xmath26 can be controlled during the growth stage by preparing micropillar cavities of different length , and the ix - dx detuning @xmath27 can be easily tuned by an applied electric field @xmath6 , where @xmath28 is an exciton detuning at zero applied field and @xmath29 is electric fiend corresponding to the crossing of the modes @xcite .    the nonlinear interactions between excitons are contained in the @xmath30 hamiltonian , given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote direct exciton , indirect exciton , and direct - indirect exciton interaction strengths .",
    "in general , the hamiltonian of the real dipolariton system involves both coherent and decoherent parts .",
    "the latter can be treated within the master equation for the density matrix @xmath35 written in the joint c - dx - ix fock space , being @xmath36 .",

    "( [ me ] ) describes pure dephasing in the system related to exciton scattering processes , characterised by the dephasing rate @xmath41 .",
    "while this term does not affect the occupation of the modes , it influences the temporal dynamics of the system , and should be accounted for in delay - dependent calculations .",
    "solving the dynamical equation to calculate the evolution of the density matrix @xmath42 , one can easily find the mean values of number operators @xmath43 , and the second order correlation function of photons , @xmath44 .",
    "while master equation simulations provide full information about the system behaviour , it is instructive to use a simplified approach based on a trial wave function , written in the form @xcite : @xmath45 represents the amplitude of the state , and we consider only the lowest fock states , assuming weak optical pumping .",
    "we can consider evolution of the system for the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath46 , where the last term accounts for the decay of the cavity mode . plugging the trial solution into the schrdinger equation @xmath47 , and assuming that the system is initially prepared in the @xmath48 state",
    ", we can find steady state values of the amplitudes .",
    "moreover , accounting for the weak pumping conditions , amplitudes can be found in an iterative manner , meaning that @xmath49 .",
    "the system of steady - state equations for amplitudes can be solved symbolically . however , the resulting expressions are too large to be presented here , and can only be analysed numerically .     and exciton detuning @xmath50 , which can be controlled by the applied electric field . ]",
    "[ fig : density_plots ]    the optimisation procedure can be realised as follows . from the six equations for the two - particle state amplitudes we are mostly interested in the two - photon state one ,",
    "it is given by a function of system parameters @xmath52 , where the rabi frequency @xmath5 , photon decay rate @xmath2 , exciton interaction constants , tunneling coupling @xmath4 and cavity detuning @xmath26 are intrinsic parameters of the sample which can be changed during the micropillar growth process only .",
    "in particular , the tunneling coupling @xmath4 is adjusted choosing the separation between quantum wells , and the cavity photon detuning @xmath26 is controlled by the cavity length @xmath53 ( or preparing an array of micropillars with different @xmath53 ) . at the same time , the detuning of the pumping laser @xmath54 can be changed in experiment using a source with adjustment of frequency and the ix - dx detuning @xmath55 is electric - field dependent , leading to a high degree of control . to achieve an optimal anti - bunching of photons one needs to find the parameters which yield nulling of both real and imaginary parts of the two - photon amplitude @xmath52 due to interference of different excitation paths [ fig .",
    "thus , we naturally choose @xmath54 and @xmath56 as optimisation parameters , while fixing the others . solving the system of two equations for optimal detuning @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    ", we can find that several branches of optimal solutions appear in a certain range of parameters .",
    "we consider a micropillar of @xmath59 m diameter with an embedded in@xmath60ga@xmath61as / gaas / in@xmath62ga@xmath63as double quantum well , where each qw has 10 nm width and the spacer width is 4 nm @xcite .",
    "the corresponding tunneling coupling and rabi frequency of the exciton - photon coupling are @xmath64 mev .",
    "the decay rate of the cavity mode is @xmath65 mev and we set the pumping to @xmath66 mev .",
    "the non - radiative exciton decay rates @xmath39 and @xmath40 are typically three orders of magnitude smaller that @xmath2 , and therefore we disregard them in master equation calculations .",
    "the exciton interaction constants for the given system can be estimated as @xmath67 mev @xcite , @xmath68 mev @xcite , and @xmath69 mev @xcite .",
    "the photonic detuning @xmath70 can be chosen in a wide range , while we note that the described photon blockade processes favour a negative value .",
    "in further calculations we fix @xmath71 mev .     shown as a function ix - dx exciton detuning @xmath50 for a fixed pump frequency @xmath72 mev , and pump intensity @xmath73 mev .",
    "green circle points the region of strong antibunching .",

    "[ fig : g2_dj ]    next we perform master equation calculations using the truncated fock space , where up to five particle states are retained for each mode .",

    ", we can calculate the photon occupation number and second - order correlation function for various values of pump and excitonic detunings .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "2(a , b ) .",
    "we note that there are several dips of @xmath0 associated to anti - bunching , which can be found in a broad range of parameters .",
    "finding these minima , one can also extract the optimal parameters which should be followed in order to have single photon emission .     and mean photon number @xmath74 are plotted as a function pump frequency @xmath75 for a fixed ix - dx exciton detuning @xmath76 mev and @xmath73 mev . ]",
    "[ fig : g2_d ]    using the optimisation procedure outlined before , we find the optimal pump and exciton detunings @xmath77 mev and @xmath78 mev , with the minimal value of second order coherence function @xmath79 .",
    "thus , we confirm that the dipolariton system indeed can serve as a setup where strong effective optical nonlinearity can be attained . finally , it is instructive to fix the pumping energy , e.g. , to @xmath72 mev and plot",
    "@xmath0 as a function of @xmath56",
    ". the result is shown in fig .",
    "3 , where both equal time second order coherence functions and mean photon numbers are plotted . we observe two slightly asymmetric minima , in the form of an inverted `` batman '' lineshape .",
    "the unconventional blockade window @xmath80 , defined as the detuning region at which @xmath0 drops below the @xmath81 level , can be estimated as @xmath82 mev . here",
    "an important improvement over previously considered systems is the possibility of on - the - flight control of the emission coherence properties , where ix - dx detuning is conveniently tuned by an electric field @xmath6 applied to the structure .",
    "additionally , we find that there are bunching regions accompanied with a strong reduction of the photon mean number ( marked by red arrows in fig",
    ". 3 ) .    also , we can perform a similar procedure , fixing the exciton detuning @xmath83 mev .",
    "the corresponding cross - section of the density plot is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : g2_d ] , showing that the statistics of the optical field emitted from the dipolariton system can be also controlled by the frequency of the laser pump .",
    "another quantity which characterises the single photon emitter is the second - order correlation function calculated for finite delay , @xmath84 . in particular , the positive derivative of this function with respect to variable @xmath85 represents a nonclassical behavior of the emitter .",
    "additionally , it is important for the experimental observation of the antibunching , where precise measurement of the equal time correlation function may be challenging .     calculated for different values of the pure dephasing of the excitons , being @xmath86 ( a ) and @xmath87ev ( b ) . ]",
    "[ fig : g2tau ]    using the master equation and quantum regression theorem we calculate the function @xmath88 starting from the steady state density matrix defined as @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "the result is shown in fig . 5 , where figures ( a ) and ( b ) were plotted for different values of excitonic dephasing @xmath41 .",
    "similarly to the case of two coupled polaritonic boxes , @xmath84 represents an oscillatory function with a period determined by the coupling parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 . assuming the excitonic pure dephasing to be absent , we find that @xmath84 experiences damped short period oscillations of @xmath90 order , with an additional long period harmonic behavior ( @xmath91 4 ps ) , shown in fig .",
    "however , accounting for the associated dephasing of excitons coming from the coulomb scattering , the calculated second order coherence function exhibits more pronounced short - scale oscillations [ fig .",
    "this can be related to the fact that while ix - dx rabi flopping is disrupted , the behaviour is mostly governed by the coherent c - dx oscillations of the period @xmath92 .",
    "we have considered a system of dipolaritons formed in a micropillar optical cavity .",
    "accounting for the linear couplings between cavity photon , direct exciton , and indirect exciton modes , and intrinsic nonlinearity for the excitons , we find associated unconventional photon blockade , leading to anti - bunching of the order @xmath93 .",
    "given the large parameter space of the system and its high sensitivity , we perform an optimisation procedure , where optimal pump detuning @xmath57 and ix - dx detuning @xmath94 can be easily adjusted to generate unconventional photon blockade .",
    "the current study thus facilitates the way towards tunable single photon sources relevant for various applications .",
