    "a schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in fig .  [ setup ] .",

    "the observation of the lateral casimir force is done using two test bodies whose surfaces are covered with longitudinal sinusoidal corrugations of the same period .",
    "the axes of the corrugations should be perfectly parallel . following @xcite",
    ", one can see that misalignment by @xmath4 of the axes of corrugations can lead to the loss of any lateral force . as the first test body , we have used a sinusoidally corrugated grating of size @xmath5 vertically mounted on the piezotube of an afm ( see fig .",
    "[ setup ] ) . here ,",
    "the corrugations have an average period @xmath6 nm ( i.e. , more than two times smaller than in refs .",
    "@xcite in order to achieve the regime where the pfa becomes inappropriate for the calculation of the lateral casimir force between the corrugated surfaces ) .",
    "the amplitude of corrugations on the grating @xmath7 nm was a factor of 1.45 larger than in refs .",
    "a @xmath8 m long v - shaped silicon nitride cantilever of the afm was first uniformly coated with 40 nm of al .",
    "this modification of cantilever was performed to improve its thermal and electric conductivity and prevent deformation due to differential thermal expansion in vacuum .",
    "a polystyrene sphere of a @xmath9 m diameter was placed at the end of the cantilever with conductive ag epoxy .",
    "next , a freshly cleaved mica sheet of @xmath10 m length , @xmath11 m width , and a few micrometer thickness was attached to the bottom of the sphere also with ag epoxy .",
    "then a second polystyrene sphere with a nominal diameter @xmath12 m was attached to the bottom free end of the mica sheet ( see fig .  [ setup ] ) .",
    "after imprint of corrugations on its surface ( see below ) , this last sphere was used as the second test body in the measurement of the lateral casimir force .",
    "we emphasize that the silver epoxy is rigid at all attachments . the first sphere and mica sheet are needed to isolate the laser reflection spot on the cantilever tip from the interaction region between the two corrugated surfaces . as a result , the effect of scattered light from the top and sides of the corrugated plate is substantially reduced .",
    "the resulting system ( cantilever , mica sheet and the attached two spheres ) was uniformly coated with a 10 nm layer of cr and then with a more than 50 nm layer of au in a thermal evaporator .",
    "uniformity of coating was ensured through rotation of the cantilever @xcite .",
    "the cr layer was used to improve the adhesion of the au coating and prevent its peeling during the imprint of the corrugations on the sphere .",
    "the lateral casimir force arises when the uniaxial corrugations on the two test bodies are perfectly aligned and have the same period @xmath13 @xcite . to ensure that these conditions are satisfied ,",
    "we have imprinted corrugations on the second sphere using the grating as a template . in order to obtain deeper corrugations than in refs .",
    "@xcite , a more sophisticated procedure was implemented . here , the template grating had a 300 nm au coating applied by the manufacturer on top of sinusoidal corrugations made of hard epoxy on a 3-mm - thick pyrex substrate .",
    "note that hard epoxy does not require the use of the oxide of al layer which was coated on the soft plastic grating in refs .",
    ". the smaller period of corrugations used here required the use of a precise stepper motor and piezocontrolled imprinting technique .",
    "the imprinting procedure was done as follows . at first",
    ", the second sphere was brought in contact with the grating using a micromanipulator .",
    "then a hard flat stylus ( see fig .  [ setup ] ) was moved in @xmath14 m steps using a stepper motor until it comes into contact with the other side of the sphere which is now sandwiched against the grating .",
    "next the imprinting was done by applying a voltage to the @xmath15 piezo to gently press the sphere between the grating and the hard flat stylus . to obtain deeper imprints while preserving sphericity some additional pressure was put on the sphere using the stepper motor .",
    "special care was needed at this step .",
    "if the applied pressure from the hard flat stylus was too much , the resulting rotation of the second sphere will cause the cantilever to break .",
    "there is less concern on the preservation of sphericity as polystyrene spheres are elastic .",
    "then the voltage on the @xmath15-piezo is reversed to remove the pressure on the sphere . with the help of the same stepper motor the hard flat stylus",
    "was gently removed and the sphere was then translated horizontally by around @xmath11 m to a different position on the grating .",
    "the last operation is necessary because the part of the grating used to imprint corrugations on the sphere might have changed its local amplitude during the imprinting process .",
    "this translation was performed preserving the orientation of the cantilever . the same imprinting procedure , but with application of larger pressure by means of the stepper motor , was done with a similar sphere in the second set of our measurements .",
    "after the imprint process was done , the system was left in vacuum for more than 2 hours to reach a stable equilibrium .",
    "the corrugations on the grating and on both spheres were examined using an afm and found to be rather homogeneous .",
    "this was done after the completion of the experiment .",
    "an afm scan of the au - coated corrugations of the vertical template grating is shown in fig .",
    "[ rghpl](a ) .",
    "the value of the amplitude of these corrugations @xmath16 , also measured using the afm , is indicated above .",
    "the variance of the stochastic roughness on the grating was estimated in the following way .",
    "the topography of the groove from an afm scan [ see fig .",
    "[ rghpl](a ) ] was fitted to a sine function .",
    "note that the top and bottom of corrugations are symmetric as expected for a sine .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ rghpl](b ) where a typical section of fig .",
    "[ rghpl](a ) along a @xmath17 plane is shown .",
    "then the difference of heights between the groove topography and the sine function was calculated at a sufficient number of intermediate points .",
    "the variance was found using these differences as the root - mean - square deviation between the two curves .",
    "a total 30 grooves were used to evaluate the average value of the variance leading to @xmath18 nm . in fig .",
    "[ rghsph](a ) we show an afm scan of the corrugations imprinted on the sphere used in the first set of our measurements .",
    "the amplitude of these corrugations over a @xmath19 area on the sphere was measured with an afm to be @xmath20 nm ( i.e. , an increase by a factor of 1.7 as compared with refs .",
    "figure  [ rghsph](b ) is a typical section of fig .",
    "[ rghsph](a ) along a @xmath17 plane .",
    "it illustrates a symmetry between the top and bottom of the imprinted corrugations .",
    "the variance of the stochastic roughness of the imprinted grooves @xmath21 was found using the same procedure as for a grating with the result @xmath22 nm .    in fig .",
    "[ sph1 ] the afm scan of a @xmath23 area of imprinted corrugations on the sphere used in the first set of measurements is demonstrated . here",
    ", the lighter tone shows higher points , as indicated in the additional scale . as is seen in fig .",
    "[ sph1 ] , the imprinting procedure did not destroy the sphericity of the imprinted surface .",
    "an afm scan of the sphere surface with imprinted corrugations used in the second set of our measurements was also performed .",
    "the amplitude of these corrugations was measured to be @xmath24 nm ( increase by a factor of 3.2 as compared with refs .",
    "the respective variance of the stochastic roughness in this case was @xmath25 nm . note that the relatively large values of the variance of the stochastic roughness presented above ( in comparison with the case of flat surfaces @xcite ) are explained by the fact that the r.m.s .",
    "deviation is calculated along the @xmath15-axis , i.e. , not perpendicular to the corrugated surface at most of the intermediate points . in fig .",
    "[ sph2 ] we show a @xmath23 area of the corrugations imprinted on the sphere used in the second set of our measurements . as can be seen in this figure ,",
    "the grooves are deeper than for the sphere used in the first set of measurements , and the sphericity of the surface is preserved .",
    "the diameters of the spheres with the imprinted corrugations used in the first and second set of measurements were measured to be @xmath26 m and @xmath27 m , respectively , using a scanning electron microscope ( sem ) .",
    "the sem was calibrated with a nist - traceable calibration grating which was independently cross calibrated with our interferometrically calibrated afm .",
    "the distinctive feature of our setup is that the lateral casimir force acting along the @xmath28-axis tangential to the corrugated sphere and a grating leads to the vertical bending of the cantilever .",
    "this bending is measured using bicell photodiodes a and b in fig .",
    "[ setup ] . whereas a force acting normal to the test bodies ( the normal casimir force ) leads to a torsional deflection of the cantilever .",
    "the torsional spring constant of the used cantilever @xmath29 was found to be 46 times larger than the bending spring constant @xmath30 ( see the next section ) . because of this the normal casimir force could lead to only a negligible change in the position of the second sphere and in the phase of the corrugations .",
    "thus the setup used is much more sensitive to detecting the lateral casimir force , while simultaneously suppressing the effect of the normal casimir force .",
    "the calibration of the cantilever ( i.e. , the determination of its spring constants ) , the measurement of the residual potential difference @xmath31 between the sphere and the plate , and the determination of the separation on contact @xmath32 were done by using both the normal and lateral electric forces .",
    "we begin with the determination of @xmath29 and @xmath31 by means of the normal electric force . for this purpose",
    "we have measured the torsional cantilever deflection due to the voltages @xmath33 applied to the grating while the sphere remained grounded .",
    "this was performed through the measurement of the difference signal between the bicell photodiodes shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] . to determine the parameters of our interest",
    ", the measured deflection signal @xmath34 at some separation @xmath35 between the zero levels of corrugations on the grating and on the sphere , where the casimir force is negligible , should be fitted to the theoretical expression for the normal electrostatic force between the corrugated surfaces . to attain these ends we begin with a brief derivation of such an expression in the sphere - plate configuration which is not available in the literature .    in the configuration of an ideal metal sphere above an ideal metal plate with smooth boundary surfaces the exact expression for the electric force is well known @xcite . in the range of separations from @xmath36 nm to @xmath37 m it can be represented @xcite by the following polynomial with a relative error less than @xmath38% @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the permittivity of free space and the numerical coefficients @xmath41 are given by @xmath42 the approximate expression for the electric force in the case when the surfaces of a sphere and a plate are covered with sinusoidal corrugations can be obtained using the pfa , as applied to electric forces . for this purpose",
    "we consider the separation along the @xmath15-axis between any two points @xmath43 on the corrugated sphere and @xmath44 on the corrugated plate @xmath45 here @xmath35 , as defined above , is the closest separation between a perfectly shaped sphere and a plate , and @xmath46 is the phase shift between the corrugations of both bodies .",
    "then , according to the pfa , the normal electric force between corrugated a sphere and a plate is obtained from eq .",

    "( [ eq7 ] ) , we applied a 3-dimensional finite element analysis ( fea ) using comsol multiphysics @xcite to numerically solve the poisson equation with appropriate boundary conditions in the configuration of corrugated sphere and plate . in the fea computation , it is difficult to use the whole corrugated sphere and plate due to computer limitations .",
    "this necessitates the use of truncated spheres and parts of the plates .",
    "such a replacement is justified as the primary contribution to the force comes from sphere - plate regions which are in close proximity .",
    "however , the error introduced by the truncation has to be independently confirmed to be negligible by varying the size of the regions of the sphere and plate used in the computations .",
    "computations were performed as a function of the common size @xmath51 of a truncated section of the corrugated sphere and a square corrugated plate . the separation distance and phase difference between the corrugations on both surfaces",
    "were set to @xmath52 nm and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "the system was enclosed in a grounded rectangular box which represents the boundary conditions at infinity .",
    "next , boundary conditions ( applied voltages ) identical to the experimental parameters were assigned to all objects .",
    "the rectangular enclosure and the sphere were both set to be grounded .",
    "the rectangular box was automatically set to be at infinity by comsol multiphysics .",
    "next the poisson equation was solved for the given boundary conditions . then the normal electrostatic force was calculated by integrating the @xmath54-component of the maxwell stress tensor over the surface of corrugated sphere and compared with eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) . to make sure that the solution converged , the size of the corrugated objects and the number of the surface mesh elements were both varied and the force recalculated . for each @xmath51 ,",
    "the number of the mesh elements was increased from one million to 22 millions until the calculated force converged .",
    "the size of the truncated section of the corrugated plate and sphere was increased from @xmath55 m to @xmath56 m .",
    "the convergence of the force was observed for @xmath57 m . the corresponding difference of eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) from the fea results varied from 36% to 2.8% when @xmath51 increased from @xmath58 m to @xmath59 m , respectively , with convergence at the largest values of @xmath51 .",

    "( [ eq7 ] ) is valid with an error less than 2.8% .",
    "it turns out that this error is almost phase independent and , thus , does not propagate to the lateral electric force .",
    "now we return to the experimental electrostatic calibrations using the normal electric force .",

    "we have presented details of the experimental setup , the original procedure allowing to imprint relatively deep corrugations using a metallized template grating on a sphere of about @xmath302 m radius , and the process of electrostatic calibrations giving the possibility to measure small forces and at short absolute separations with high precision .",

    "the maximum value of the lateral force as a function of separation was also investigated in the two sets of measurements .",
    "both the random and systematic errors of the measured forces and separations were found and the total experimental errors were calculated at a 95% confidence level .    the experimental data were compared with an approximate theory using the pfa and with the exact theory based on the scattering approach .",
    "note that exact calculation methods allowing the evaluation of the casimir force between bodies of arbitrary shape and made of any real material have been actively investigated since 2006 @xcite .",
    "however , until the present paper and the rapid communication @xcite there was no detailed comparison of exact theoretical results beyond the lifshitz theory taking into account such experimental conditions as real material properties of the test bodies , surface roughness and nonzero temperature with measurement data of any specific experiment . using the exact theory , the computed dependences of the lateral casimir force on the phase shift and of the maximum magnitude of the lateral force as a function of separation were found to be in agreement with the experimental data . regarding the pfa approach ,",
    "the computational results were found to be excluded by the data .",
    "this provides the quantitative confirmation for the fact that this experiment was performed outside the applicability region of the pfa and marks the beginning of investigations of diffraction effects in the phenomenon of the lateral casimir force .",
    "as was already noted in the introduction , the lateral casimir force might find applications in nanotechnology .",
    "specifically , it was proposed to use this effect for the frictionless transmission of lateral motion by means of a nanoscale rack and pinion without intermeshing cogs @xcite or in a ratchet with asymmetric corrugations driven by the casimir force @xcite .",

    "<S> the dependences of the lateral force on the phase shift between the corrugations on both test bodies were measured at different separations in two sets of measurements with different amplitudes of corrugations on the sphere . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum magnitude of the lateral force as a function of separation was also measured in two successive experiments . </S>",
    "<S> all measurement data were compared with the theoretical approach using the proximity force approximation and with the exact theory based on rayleigh expansions with no fitting parameters . in both cases real material properties of the test bodies and nonzero temperature </S>",
    "<S> were taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the data were found to be in a good agreement with the exact theory but deviate significantly from the predictions of the proximity force approximation approach . </S>",
    "<S> this provides the quantitative confirmation for the observation of diffraction - type effects that are disregarded within the pfa approach . </S>",
    "<S> possible applications of the phenomenon of the lateral casimir force in nanotechnology for the operation of micromachines are discussed . </S>"
