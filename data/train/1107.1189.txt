    "in the last decades , the study of ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) has been one of the most active areas in astroparticle physics  @xcite .",
    "the detection of extensive air showers ( eas ) created by uhecr in the atmosphere has been accomplished mainly with two detection methods .",
    "the first consists on detecting the particles of the cascade reaching the ground using an array of particle detectors .",
    "the second method uses telescopes to detect the fluorescence photons emitted by the particles in the shower as they travel through the atmosphere .",
    "only the latter method is able to directly measure the eas longitudinal development in the atmosphere , but is subject to a very low duty cycle ( @xmath2 ) , since it can only be used in clear moonless nights .",
    "the surface array and fluorescence techniques are used simultaneously at the pierre auger cosmic ray observatory  @xcite .    radio emission from eas",
    "was first observed by jelley et al .",
    "@xcite in 1964 .",
    "theoretical and experimental research in this area was very active in the sixties and early seventies .",
    "we refer the reader to a review by allan  @xcite and references therein .",
    "nevertheless , interest in this technique declined in the late seventies , mainly due to radio interference  @xcite .",
    "recent developments in high speed electronics and information technology have renewed interest in the detection of radio emission in the mhz range from the particles in eas .",
    "the radio detection technique is , in principle , sensitive to the longitudinal development of the shower , like the fluorescence technique , but its duty cycle is much higher , since it could be used anytime except during thunderstorms .",
    "this resurgence of the radio technique has taken form as new experiments have been developed , such as codalema  @xcite , lopes  @xcite and aera  @xcite , accompanied by new calculations of the radio emission in eas , which include analytical techniques with different levels of sophistication  @xcite , monte carlo methods  @xcite and semi - analytical methods  @xcite .    in this work we present zhaires  @xcite ( zhs+aires ) , a new simulation of radio emission in eas that combines the full shower simulation capabilities of aires  @xcite with specific algorithms developed to calculate the electric field emitted by particles in dense media showers , implemented in the well tested zhs code  @xcite .",
    "these algorithms are obtained from first principles , so no emission mechanism or model is presupposed .",
    "the radio emission calculations are done in parallel to the aires shower simulation : as each charged particle in the shower is propagated by aires in steps , each propagation step is taken as a single particle track and its contribution to the radio emission is calculated and added to the total electric field in both the time and frequency domains .",
    "this procedure naturally accounts for interference effects associated to the different space - time positions of the particles in the shower .",
    "other monte carlo simulations of radio emission of air showers exist , such as reas  @xcite , where the electron and positron tracks from corsika  @xcite simulations are first histogrammed and then used to generate random @xmath3 trajectories , which in turn are used for the radio emission calculations in the time domain only . an earlier version of this code , reas2  @xcite , was based only on geosynchrotron emission , but was shown to be inconsistent with later simulations  @xcite , which in turn are based on a pretty generic algorithm  @xcite that has been used for a long time to simulate pulses generated in dense media  @xcite .",
    "another difference is that zhaires uses a model for the variation of the refractive index with altitude , while reas uses a fixed refractive index equal to unity in its calculations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : emission ] we give a short overview of the main radio emission mechanisms in air showers and the specific formalism used for emission calculations in zhaires , including a model for the variation of the refractive index with altitude . in section [ sec:1dmodel ]",
    "we develop a one - dimensional toy model useful for understanding the main characteristics of the emission and stress the prominent role played by geometry . in section [ sec : results ] we show results of zhaires simulations , discussing the influence of the distance from the antenna to the shower core , the refractive index and the shower zenith angle on the electric field pulse .",
    "we also discuss the spectrum of the radio emission . in section [ sec : polarization ]",
    "we analyze the polarization of the electric field and discuss how it can be used to separate the contributions from various emission mechanisms .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusion ] we conclude the paper .",
    "in air showers , the dominant mechanism responsible for the radio emission is believed to be the deflection by the geomagnetic field of electrons and positrons in the shower  @xcite .",
    "several approaches have been developed to model this emission .",
    "since the direction of the lorentz force depends on charge , it leads to a spatial separation of electrons and positrons in the shower , that can be thought of as a moving macroscopic dipole and a transverse current traveling through the atmosphere at a speed @xmath4 along with the shower front , and which has been the basis for macroscopic calculations  @xcite .",
    "another approach , which is adopted in this work , is to calculate the emission for each particle trajectory , i.e. a microscopic approach  @xcite .",
    "the geomagnetic mechanism has a quite clear signature .",
    "its polarization is anti - parallel to the direction of the lorentz force , i.e. in the direction of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the speed of the particle in @xmath7 units and @xmath8 the geomagnetic field  @xcite .",
    "another emission mechanism also thought to be important in eas is the askaryan effect .",
    "it was first proposed by askaryan  @xcite , who suggested that coherent radiation could be emitted by showers in which a charge excess develops .",
    "this mechanism , which dominates the radio emission of showers in dense media , is also known as the charge excess mechanism . for a particle following a straight track at constant speed",
    ", it can be shown @xcite that : @xmath9\\ ] ]    so the electric field emitted by particles traveling along the shower axis lies in the plane defined by the direction of the shower axis ( @xmath6 ) and the observation direction @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , it is perpendicular to @xmath10 and its direction depends on the charge of the particle , pointing towards ( away from ) the shower axis for negative ( positive ) charges @xcite .",
    "this means that if there is no charge excess in the shower , the net electric field is zero .",
    "however it is well known that knock - on interactions and compton scattering incorporate electrons from molecules of the medium into the shower , leading to an excess of moving negative charges @xcite , which in turn are responsible for a net electric field with a radial polarization w.r.t . the shower core .",
    "the algorithms used for the calculation of radio emission in zhaires are based on zhs algorithms  @xcite .",
    "these were derived from first principles , namely from the lienard - wiechert potentials , and thus do not assume any emission mechanism .",
    "the full derivation can be seen in  @xcite for frequency domain calculations , and  @xcite for the time domain .",
    "the trajectories of shower particles are divided in tracks , which can be made arbitrarily small . both the speed of the particle and the direction to the observer are assumed not to vary over the track . in fig .",
    "[ fig : singletrack ] we show a schematic picture of such a track",
    ". a convenient division of trajectories in small tracks is already performed by monte carlo simulations of shower development in order to propagate the particles in the shower .",
    "the zhs algorithm is then used to calculate the contribution of each track to the net emission of the shower , accounting for any interference between tracks .",
    "this approach automatically takes into account the contribution to the electric field due to the start , end , and any change in the direction and energy of each particle track .",
    "thus any kind of deflection , scattering , creation or annihilation of a charged particle , due to any physical process used to simulate the shower is taken into account in the radio emission@xcite .    in the original zhs algorithms  @xcite",
    ", the field calculation is performed in the fraunhofer approximation . in this case",
    "the observer `` sees ''",
    "the radiation arriving from all the points in the shower at the same angle , and only changes in the phase of the contribution from each point are taken into account through a simple projection .",
    "this approach works well for showers in dense media , such as ice , since the size of the shower is much smaller than the typical distance to the antennas .",
    "but in the case of air showers , the distance to the observer is usually of the order of the shower size , and thus the fraunhofer approximation breaks down . in order to make the method valid for the closer observers in air showers ,",
    "we allow the distance and direction to the observer to change from one track to the next . the direction and distance to the antenna",
    "are still taken to be constant inside a single track ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : singletrack ] ) , i.e. we still use the fraunhofer approximation inside each track .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that this procedure reproduces the expected behavior @xmath11 of the field  @xcite , where @xmath12 is the distance between the charge and the observer .",
    "since we still use the fraunhofer approximation inside a single track of length l , the following condition has to be satisfied :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the wavelength of the emission . in the simulation ,",
    "the vast majority of tracks satisfy this condition for frequencies up to 300 mhz , which is much higher than the frequency of the maximum of the emission , @xmath15 mhz .",
    "if a particular track in the simulation does not satisfy this condition , e.g. a track passes very close to an antenna , it is further divided into several sub - tracks , and the field calculation is performed using a different r and @xmath16 for each sub - track .",
    "the positions @xmath17 , times @xmath18 and kinetic energies @xmath19 for the beginning and end points of the track are obtained directly from aires .",
    "this , along with the position @xmath20 of the antenna is all that is needed for the calculation of the contribution to the vector potential @xmath21 due to a given track : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the vector from the middle point of the track to the antenna , @xmath24 , @xmath25 $ ] is the projection of @xmath6 onto a plane perpendicular to @xmath10 , @xmath26 are the retarded ( detection ) times for the beginning and end of the track , respectively , @xmath27 is the average time for the track and @xmath28 is the heaviside step function ) for @xmath29 is used instead of eq .",
    "( [ eq : timefresnel ] ) if the denominator vanishes . ] .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : timefresnel ] ) is written in the radiation gauge , since we disregard the static term of the lienard - wiechert potentials in its derivation  @xcite .    to obtain the radio signal at each antenna for the shower as a whole",
    ", the contributions of each particle track to the vector potential @xmath30 are added up .",
    "this net vector potential is then differentiated with respect to time to obtain the net electric field as a function of time for each antenna . in the far field , this formalism is equivalent to the one used in  @xcite , as shown in  @xcite .",
    "besides the field calculations in the time domain , zhaires can calculate the radio emission in the frequency domain as well .",
    "the radiation term of the electric field is @xmath31 . applying this to the vector potential expression ( eq . [ eq : timefresnel ] )",
    "we obtain  @xcite : @xmath32    in the zhs formalism  @xcite , we use the following convention for the fourier transform : @xmath33 applying this fourier transform convention to eq .",
    "( [ eq : timefresnel - ef ] ) we obtain  @xcite : @xmath34 which is the expression we use for the fresnel regime frequency - domain calculations in zhaires",
    ". the contributions of each track to @xmath35 are added up to obtain the net spectrum at each antenna .",
    "as stated before , in zhaires we use a model for the variation of the refractive index @xmath0 with altitude in the atmosphere .",
    "in fact there is a strong dependence of @xmath0 on temperature , pressure and humidity .",
    "to take the dependence with altitude into account we use an exponential model for the variation of the refractivity @xmath36 with height @xmath37 , motivated by the exponential decrease of density with altitude , @xmath38 where @xmath39\\times 10 ^ 6 $ ] is the refractivity at an altitude @xmath37 in km and we used @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "these values reproduce the refractivity calculated in  @xcite up to @xmath42 km within less than @xmath43 .",
    "the values in @xcite take into account the humidity dependence of the refractivity , which increases the refractivity at low altitudes where the effect of a variable index of refraction is most important , since the shower has a larger number of particles . at higher altitudes ,",
    "the exponential model slightly overestimates the refractivity , but the effect of the variable index of refraction at these altitudes is much less important , since above 20 km the shower has barely started developing and the number of particles is small .",
    "it is also worth noting that since @xmath36 depends on temperature and humidity , there are large seasonal and even daily variations in the refractivity that are associated to atmospheric conditions and can not thus be accurately described by any model ) , as described in  @xcite . ] .",
    "the variable atmospheric refractive index would in principle make the radio emission follow a curved path .",
    "however , in @xcite it was shown that the effect of the deviation from a straight path on the time structure of the pulse is negligible , and thus in zhaires we assume that the radio emission follows a straight path from the emission point to the antenna . however , we explicitely take into account the effect of a variable refractive index in the propagation time of the signal . for this purpose",
    "we calculate an effective refractive index @xmath44 for each particle track in the zhaires shower simulation : @xmath45 where @xmath12 is the distance from the track to the observer , and @xmath46 is an infinitesimal length along that path whose altitude @xmath37 varies along the path .",
    "it is important to note that while @xmath44 is used for the calculation of the retarded times , @xmath47 is used for the angular dependence of the emission , given by the denominator of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : timefresnel ] ) and ( [ eq : freqfresnel ] ) , i.e. the cherenkov angle depends only on the refractive index at the emission altitude .",
    "we expect the effect of the variable refractive index to be more important at relatively low altitudes , where @xmath0 is larger .",
    "since @xmath0 in our model varies between @xmath48 at high altitudes and @xmath49 close to ground , we expect the effect of the variable @xmath0 on the pulse characteristics discussed in section [ sec:1dmodel ] ( such as start - time , duration and compression in time ) to be between the effects obtained for @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "this can be clearly seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : tdetxdepth ] and [ fig : fc - varn ] below .",
    "we can gain much understanding of the main features of the radio pulses in the time - domain with the aid of a very simple model .",
    "we show in this section that many of the characteristics of the pulse such as start - time , peak value of the electric field and duration in time , are mainly determined by the geometry of the system formed by the shower and the observer . in the model",
    "we assume a vertical atmospheric shower in which particles propagate along the shower axis at the speed of light @xmath7 , and we ignore their lateral spread . for the moment",
    "we assume a constant index of refraction @xmath0 .",
    "we do not make any assumption on the radio emission mechanism , and we just account for the retarded time , i.e. the radio signal is emitted at a time @xmath52 and reaches the observer located at a distance @xmath53 to the shower core at a later time @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is given by the electromagnetic wave travel time between the emission point and the observer . the model can also be applied to understand the radio emission properties in dense media  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : geotoy ] we show a sketch of the model .",
    "the origin of time @xmath56 is arbitrarily fixed at the time at which the shower front reaches ground .",

    "the start - time time of the electric field pulse is given by the minimum value of @xmath61 . by doing @xmath62",

    "due to relativistic effects associated to the speed of the shower ( assumed to be @xmath7 ) being larger than the speed of the radio waves ( @xmath70 ) , at a fixed detection time @xmath71 an observer at a distance @xmath53 from the shower core may see two different stages of shower development ( two different heights @xmath72 ) simultaneously .",

    "this apparent violation of causality is simply a relativistic effect due to the particles traveling faster that the speed of the pulse in the medium .",
    "when @xmath50 the shower is seen by any antenna away from the core in a `` causal '' way , from beginning to end , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : tdetxdepth ] , provided the observer is not located on the shower axis ( when @xmath50 and @xmath75 the whole shower is seen at the same instant of time ) .    when @xmath53 is sufficiently large or @xmath50 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : htmin ] ) ) , @xmath64 can become larger than the actual height at which the shower starts developing , namely the height @xmath76 where the first interaction occurs .",
    "the emission from heights above the first interaction point is due to the primary particle only and can be neglected . in that case ,",
    "the observer would start to see the onset of the pulse at a time corresponding to the height @xmath76 :    @xmath77    the height @xmath76 can be considered a physical limit on @xmath64 , which corresponds to the depth @xmath78 of the first interaction .",

    "[ fig : tdetxdepth ] by truncating the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : tdetxdepth ] at the minimum depth @xmath78 .",
    "so , for any given @xmath0 , there is a critical distance @xmath80 , at which @xmath81 :    @xmath82    for @xmath1 , as we move away from the shower axis the start time first increases linearly with @xmath53 ( following eq .",
    "( [ eq : tdetmin ] ) ) until @xmath83 . for larger @xmath53",
    "it follows the non - linear behavior of eq .",

    "for @xmath1 , observers at distances greater than @xmath80 will also see the shower in a `` causal '' way , starting at @xmath76 , and in this model they never see the shower at the cherenkov angle .",
    "the peak value of the radio pulse is mainly determined by three factors , namely , the distance from the shower to the observer , the number of charged particles in the shower , and also and in a very important way by geometrical effects associated to a time compression factor .",
    "the relation between the observer time and the shower height , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tdet ] ) and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tdetxdepth ] , is non linear .",
    "one can consider a given observer time interval and obtain from this relation the interval of the shower development that contributes to it .",
    "clearly , the portion of shower development that contributes will be large when the slope of this relation is small .",
    "we can define a compression factor @xmath85 taking the derivative of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tdet ] ) with respect to @xmath37 : @xmath86 } \\label{eq : compression}\\ ] ] the absolute value accounts for the fact that the derivative of @xmath61 with respect to @xmath37 changes sign when @xmath68 ( i.e. @xmath87 ) , corresponding to a reversal in the time sequence of the shower as seen by the observer .",
    "the inverse of the compression ( or doppler ) factor @xmath85 can be thought of as a measure of the compression in time  @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , a small value of @xmath85 implies that the emission from a relatively large portion of the shower contributes to the pulse in a relatively small interval of observer s time @xmath88 , increasing the pulse with respect to other cases in which the factor @xmath85 is larger .",
    "moreover , when @xmath89 ( i.e. @xmath90 ) then @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "this is related to the fact that the observer sees the shower at @xmath87 with an angle equal to the cherenkov angle , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : theta_start ] ) .",
    "in fact , since @xmath93 it is straightforward to show that the factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : compression ] ) is proportional to @xmath94 . as a consequence of @xmath91 , the factor @xmath95 in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : timefresnel ] ) goes to zero , tending to enhance the peak value of the pulse , seen at the cherenkov angle would have to vanish ( within the precision of our code ) at precisely the middle of the track ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : singletrack ] ) .",
    "this ( almost ) never happens , but if it does , the code uses the limit of eq .",
    "( [ eq : timefresnel ] ) for @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "also note that just like in reality ( and monte carlo too ) there is a finite time resolution ( we use @xmath97 ns in this work ) , which spreads very high ( and short ) vector potential peaks over the whole time bin . ]",
    "it is important to note that although a small @xmath85 induces a very big effect in the pulse in the 1d model where all particles follow the shower axis , in a real shower this effect will be less important due to the lateral and angular spread of the particles in the shower .",
    "the lateral and angular spread will change the observer angle and increase the compression factor at @xmath64 with respect to what the 1d model predicts ( @xmath98 ) , since @xmath99 .",
    "furthermore , the lateral spread of the particles in a real shower will also change the distance to the observer , smearing the arrival time of the signal .    as stated before ,",
    "the peak value of the pulse is also determined by other factors besides @xmath85 .",
    "there is a non - trivial interplay between the length and height of the part of the shower seen with a small compression factor , the number of particles in that region of the shower development , and the distance @xmath12 to the observer .",
    "a clear illustration of this interplay can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fc ] , where we plot @xmath85 as a function of @xmath37 along with a gaisser - hillas parameterization of shower development for a @xmath100 ev shower . when @xmath51 ( left panel ) the largest compression in time applies to the region around shower maximum for an observer at @xmath101  m , while for an observer at @xmath102  m the largest compression applies to a portion of the shower with fewer particles , below shower maximum .",
    "one could think that the peak of the pulse will always drop as @xmath53 increases and the observer gets further away from shower axis , but the factor @xmath85 can slow down this trend ( e.g. between @xmath102  m and @xmath101  m in fig .  [ fig : fc ] ) or even reverse it .",
    "moreover , as @xmath53 increases , the width of the peak in @xmath85 becomes larger ( this can be appreciated by inspection of the widths at values of @xmath103  ns / m in fig .  [",
    "fig : fc ] ) and this implies that a larger portion of the shower contributes quasi - simultaneously to the observed emission . on the other hand , as @xmath53 increases so does the distance from the emission point to the antenna , tending to decrease the signal .",
    "one can see that even in this simple 1d model the interplay of the various relevant variables is already very complicated and somewhat counter - intuitive . for observers at larger distances to the core ( e.g. @xmath104  m in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : tdetxdepth ] ) , the largest compression is achieved only at very high altitudes where the number of particles in the shower is much smaller than at shower maximum , and thus the peak value of the pulse is much smaller than that seen by an observer at @xmath102  m ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : tdetxdepth ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : fc ] ) .",
    "the 1d model also allows to understand the time duration of the electric pulse .",
    "the shower arrives at ground at @xmath105 and the signal from the shower when it reaches the ground arrives at the observer at a time @xmath106 . assuming that the emission is only due to the shower front , the time duration @xmath107 of the pulse , as seen by the observer , is then given by :    @xmath108    where @xmath66 is given by eq .",

    "( [ eq : t0 ] ) , but this does not change significantly the behavior of @xmath107 , which stays approximately linear with @xmath53 .",
    "so the observers see an increasingly wider pulse in time the farther they are from the shower core .",
    "another estimate for the variation of the pulse width with distance can be found in  @xcite .",
    "this approach is an oversimplification as it assumes that the shower still contributes to the pulse as it reaches ground level , so it needs to be modified for very inclined showers .",
    "in addition it also neglects the delays of the particles that lag behind the shower front and also contribute to the pulse , making it wider .",
    "still the simple expressions obtained can be quite useful to interpret the results from the full simulation , shown in the next section .",
    "the 1d model also allows to study the dependence of the pulse properties on the index of refraction . for the purpose of understanding the relevance of @xmath0 on the pulse",
    ", we first assume @xmath0 to be constant with height . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : tdetmin ] ) it is straightforward to deduce that the start - time of the pulse increases with @xmath0 because the propagation time of the signal from the height of emission to the observer increases with @xmath0 .",

    "( [ eq : delta_t ] ) , the time duration of the pulse decreases slightly with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "another dependence of the pulse properties on @xmath0 arises because the factor @xmath85 is also dependent on @xmath0 .",
    "an observer at a fixed given distance @xmath53 from the core will see different parts of the same shower with a small @xmath85 ( i.e. with a large compression in time ) for different values of @xmath0 , since @xmath64 ( which defines the altitude at which @xmath113 and the shower is seen with @xmath114 ) decreases with @xmath0 . to illustrate this",

    "another interesting work  @xcite , developed independently and in parallel with ours , deals with similar issues .",
    "the refractive index determines the angular distribution of the radiation at the emission point , as well as its propagation through the atmosphere and non trivial relativistic effects arise due to the refractive index @xmath1 .",
    "we have developed a simple 1-dimensional model to address the characteristics of the radio pulse , which qualitatively allows us to interpret the pulse height , width and its dependence on the refractive index and the distance from antenna to shower core @xcite .",
    "the intensity of the radio pulses is typically highest for those observers that see a region of the shower containing a large number of particles ( such as shower maximum ) with an angle close to the cherenkov angle .",
    "there is a non - trivial interplay between the distance from the emission point in the shower to the observation point , the angle between the particle direction and the observer , and the number of particles in the region of the emission , whose effects can only be accurately determined with monte carlo simulations such as those developed in this work .",
    "these key elements determine for instance that far from the shower axis inclined showers typically induce a more intense radiation than vertical ones @xcite as we show with our zhaires simulations .",
    "we have shown that the frequency at which the emission spectrum is maximum , which is in the range @xmath198-@xmath199  mhz for @xmath200 m , decreases as the distance @xmath53 from the antenna to the shower core increases ( for @xmath116  m see also @xcite ) .",
    "so most experiments , which typically are only sensitive to frequencies above @xmath199  mhz , in fact only measure the incoherent part of the spectrum , even very close to the shower core .",
    "we also observed that the signal at higher frequencies decreases more rapidly with @xmath53 than at the fully coherent 1 mhz range , where we observed a maximum in the emission at around @xmath201 m , similar to the one reported in @xcite .",
    "our results also suggest that this maximum is dependant on frequency and on observer direction w.r.t .",
    "the shower core .",
    "we have also explored the polarization properties of the radiation , confirming the expectation that the radiation is mainly polarized in the opposite direction to the lorentz force induced by the magnetic field of the earth  @xcite .",
    "far from the shower core , our simulations show that the polarization is compatible with the presence of a significant amount of radiation due to the askaryan effect , as in  @xcite .",
    "we have also shown , using a very simple model , that as the askaryan component of the emission becomes dominant over the geomagnetic one at larger distances to the core , the parameter @xmath161 changes its periodicity on the azimuthal angle of the observer . when both , the geomagnetic and askaryan components are significant , the periodicity is @xmath177 , but when the emission is dominated by the askaryan effect , a @xmath175 periodicity can be clearly appreciated . in inclined showers",
    "we have stressed the role played by the relative orientation of the shower axis and the magnetic field on the polarization .",
    "a significant vertical component of the electric field arises in inclined showers which calls for detection instruments able to observe it .",
