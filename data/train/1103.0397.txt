    "electrostatic interactions between rod - like and stripe - like charged objects play a substantial role in the many systems of condensed matter and soft condensed matter physics such as strongly correlated materials , liquid crystals , electrolytes , polymers , and bio - molecules . for example , superconductors and anti - ferromagnetic mott insulators are a vast class of strongly correlated systems which their quantum phases have been studied intensively .",
    "several evidences signifying the segregation of charged carriers into fluctuating stripes in cuprate superconductors have been augmented @xcite . in the ceramic samples @xmath10 co - doped with @xmath11 the charged stripes are seen by neutron diffraction as a static lattice modulation coherent with the low - temperature tetragonal modulation @xcite",
    ". nickelates @xcite ( @xmath12 ) are the other good empirical realities for observing the charged stripes at low temperatures .",
    "the relationship between correlations of charged stripes and high-@xmath13 superconductivity has been studied intensively in nickelates .",
    "more physical insights are gained by obtaining a closed form formula for the interaction of such stripes .",
    "indeed , the closed form gives us many useful information on the physical properties of the system such as orderings and correlations of the charged stripes and also the thermodynamic properties of the system .",
    "experimental evidences of such interactions are also observed in the colloidal world .",
    "actually in the colloidal solutions , macromolecules such as dna molecules , @xmath14 or @xmath15 virus , @xmath16 ribbons , crystalline boehmite ( alooh ) rods , etc.@xcite are intrinsically very anisotropic and have rod - like and ribbon - like shapes . in the context of orientational phase transition , it has been elucidated that the electrostatic interaction between the polyelectrolytes is lead to a twisting effect which enhances the concentration at the isotropic to nematic ( i - n ) phase transition .",
    "more findings are attained by making use of the form of the interaction energy between such objects .",
    "many efforts have been done to employ the analytical and numerical approaches for computing the electrostatic interaction of two rod - like charged objects . in a route developed work ,",
    "d. chapot et .",
    "al considered two anisotropic particles , separated by a large distance ( i.e a distance larger than their typical dimension ) and generalized the derjaguin , landau , verwey and overbeek ( dlvo ) calculations for the anisotropic molecules @xcite .",
    "they have obtained an expression for the interaction energy between the particles @xcite . however , because of performing various expansions , their expression is valid in the far field limit , i.e for inter - particles distance larger than both the debye length @xmath17 and the typical size of the colloid @xmath18 .",
    "meanwhile , the surface charge of the objects is involved in their calculations which should be obtained numerically . in the other hand , using molecular dynamics and monte carlo simulations the interplay between the electrostatic interactions and orientational correlations have been studied for a 1d array of charged rods @xcite .    despite of all simulations and analytical approaches ,",
    "the lake of a closed form formula for the interaction energy of such anisotropic particles is felt . in this paper",
    "we have obtained a _ closed form _",
    "formula for the interaction energy of two rod - like charged objects with lengths @xmath1 and @xmath2 and arbitrary orientations in three dimension , separated by @xmath0 . by using the closed form formula",
    "we have computed the thermodynamic functions of a one dimensional array of charged rods in which each rod interacts only with two nearest neighbors .",
    "although , the electrostatic interaction is long range and there are no practical realization to vindicate our assumption , one can get more insight about our finding closed form formula and its direct effects on the thermodynamic behaviors of a system .",
    "finally the relationship between the behavior of the specific heat and the electrostatic interaction energy is investigated .",
    "let us consider a system of two inflexible rod - like charged objects with lengths @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which are separated by a distance @xmath0 .",
    "the interaction energy between two such uniformly charged objects is given by the following formula @xcite _ int.=_-l_1^l_1_-l_2^l_2 [ formula1 ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 indicate the position vectors of two charge elements @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively . the inverse debye screening length , @xmath23 , does characterize the decay rate of the interaction energy in the far field limit .",

    "thus no variation is seen on the energy value of the two rods and @xmath71 . for the orientations which are indicated by @xmath66 ,",

    "we have plotted the function @xmath91 versus @xmath0 in fig.([phi ] ) . as it is clearly seen @xmath91",
