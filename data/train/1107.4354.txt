    "the standard model ( sm ) provides a very good description of experimental observables measured at high - energy colliders .",
    "the sm is a renormalizable theory and admits a perturbative description at scales of the order of the weak scale .",
    "the higgs boson  @xcite is the only element of the sm that has not been discovered , and plays an important role in ensuring the perturbative consistency of the theory . within the sm ,",
    "precision electroweak observables suggest a light higgs boson , with mass below about 180  gev .",
    "searches for a higgs particle are therefore some of the most important activities in high energy physics .",
    "currently , collider searches are performed at the lhc and the tevatron experiments , and tevatron data has already excluded the presence of a sm - like higgs boson with a mass in the range 158173  gev at the 95% confidence level  @xcite . at cern , the lhc is accumulating record high luminosities , and it is expected to probe the whole sm higgs mass region below  500 gev by the end of 2011 .",
    "the most challenging mass region for higgs searches at the lhc is the closest to the current lep bound of about 115  gev . in this low mass region ,",
    "the main search channel at the lhc comes from the higgs production via gluon fusion and its rare decay into two photons  @xcite . other relevant search channels , which require higher statistics , are weak boson fusion with @xmath11 and higgs associated production with weak vector bosons , with @xmath12 .",
    "it is expected that by the end of the year the associated production @xmath9 channels at the tevatron will be able to test the sm - higgs mass region close to the present lep bound  @xcite .",
    "in this note we concentrate on searches for neutral higgs bosons in the @xmath2-conserving minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite . in most of the mssm parameter space",
    "there is a light higgs boson with sm - like couplings to gauge bosons and a mass below 130  gev  @xcite .",
    "additional @xmath2-even , @xmath2-odd , and charged higgs bosons exist in this model and possess enhanced couplings to the third generation fermions  @xcite .",
    "searches for these non - standard higgs bosons are being performed at the tevatron and the lhc , with the lhc rapidly surpassing the tevatron capabilities in the main modes where neutral @xmath2-even and @xmath2-odd higgs bosons decay into @xmath13-lepton pairs  @xcite .    in previous articles",
    "we have studied the reach of both the tevatron and a 14  tev lhc in their searches for standard and non - standard higgs bosons of the mssm  @xcite .",
    "since the lhc is now operating at a center of mass energy of 7  tev , it is important to perform a realistic estimate of its reach in the first years of running .",
    "in the course of this analysis we stress the fact that in supersymmetry , the presence of more than one higgs doublet means that mixing between the neutral components can produce a state with sm - like gauge couplings but very different branching fractions from the sm higgs boson . in general , the @xmath14 width of the sm - like higgs boson is increased to a degree controlled by the @xmath2-odd mass @xmath3 , and this effect suppresses the rates into other states such as @xmath15 ( the diphoton suppression was also discussed in  @xcite , and more recently in  @xcite ) . for more specialized values of the soft supersymmetry - breaking parameters , the @xmath14 width can be suppressed and the rates into other states are enhanced .",
    "we study both of these possibilities in detail and demonstrate that when the main lhc searches for @xmath7 are weakened , either lhc nonstandard higgs searches can be used to probe the parameter space , or a statistical combination with the tevatron data may be used to provide evidence for the presence of @xmath7 . on the other hand , when @xmath10 is enhanced in the mssm",
    ", we show that the lhc will quickly reach discovery potential for the sm - like higgs boson , while non - standard higgs searches will provide a complementary search channel .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we discuss the statistical methods used in our analysis . in section 3",
    "we show the lhc results in different benchmark scenarios . in section 4",
    "we demonstrate that non - standard higgs boson searches , as well as searches for sm - like higgs bosons at the tevatron , offer power complementary to that of the sm - like higgs channels at the lhc . in section 5",
    "we conclude .",
    "searches for sm - like higgs bosons at hadron colliders are performed in a diverse set of channels , and the reach of sm - like higgs bosons searches has been thoroughly studied by the experimental collaborations .",
    "we base our analysis on the results of these experimental analyses , properly interpreting them in the mssm context and combining the significance of different channels .",
    "since the reaches for sm - like higgs bosons at cms and atlas are quite similar , for simplicity , we estimate the combined lhc reach by doubling the luminosity at the atlas experiment and assuming 5 fb@xmath0/channel / experiment ( i.e. , all channels are taken to 10 fb@xmath0 with @xmath16 rescaling ) .",
    "both the gaussian scaling of the statistical significance and the 2xatlas approximation are expected to preserve the qualitative features of the expected reach . for illustration",
    ", we also show results with 10 and 15 fb@xmath0/channel / experiment .",
    "the channels all include improvement factors as detailed in the atlas note  @xcite . in our plots",
    "we study the expected reach on the @xmath17 plane , fixing the values of the soft parameters . at each point on the plane the higgs spectrum , decay rates , and production cross sections",
    "are calculated with feynhiggs  @xcite , and a quantity @xmath18 is calculated for each channel as the ratio of the signal ( cross section times higgs decay branching ratio ) that can be probed at the 95% confidence level relative to the signal predicted by the mssm at that point .",
    "we combine the @xmath18 values from multiple channels in inverse quadrature , and the lhc is expected to have exclusion power for a point when the combined @xmath19 .",
    "more generally , @xmath18 is related to the expected statistical significance @xmath20 of discovery or exclusion via @xmath21 . in practice , the inverse quadrature combination results in a reach for the sm - like higgs boson that is 10 - 20% more conservative than the more precise combination performed by atlas  @xcite . to compensate",
    ", we apply an additional 15% improvement factor .",
    "when relevant , we also show contours of 3 and 5@xmath20 reach .",
    "we expect the results presented in this analysis to give a good estimate of the mssm bounds that would follow for a more precise combination of the atlas and cms results .    similarly to the case of the lhc , for the analysis involving tevatron data we estimate",
    "the reach by doubling the luminosity at the cdf experiment with a luminosity of 10  fb@xmath0  @xcite ( all channels are taken to 20 fb@xmath0 with @xmath16 rescaling . )",
    "we include a 30% improvement factor to account for ongoing analysis optimizations  @xcite and as performed for the lhc , the @xmath18 values from each channel are combined in inverse quadrature . in practice",
    "this combination is simple but effective for the tevatron , differing for the sm higgs by no more than about 6% from the results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the low mass region , with a mean deviation of less than a percent between 110 and 130 gev .",
    "we consider first two standard benchmark scenarios , known as the maximal and minimal mixing scenarios  @xcite , for the low - scale soft supersymmetry breaking parameters .",
    "the reach for the sm - like higgs boson is shown in these two models on the @xmath17 plane in fig .",
    "[ lhccombfig ] . for illustration",
    ", we give the results for 5 , 10 , and 15 fb@xmath0 of data per experiment .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ lhcnsfig ] we overlay the estimated reach for the neutral mssm higgs bosons with nonstandard gauge couplings in the maximal and minimal mixing scenarios . the 95% cl limit is derived from the expected limits given in the recent atlas @xmath22 search with 36 pb@xmath0 ( which are cut at @xmath23 gev ) , using the tree - level approximation that the reach in @xmath24 scales like @xmath25 and the useful property that the nonstandard higgs expected reach is robust against changes in the soft parameters  @xcite ( although some weak dependence on @xmath26 can appear for large values of @xmath26  @xcite . )",
    "this demonstrates the complementarity of the two types of higgs searches at the lhc : a statistical combination of the channels should be able to test the parameter space of the model , even though none of the particles @xmath27 can necessarily be probed on all of the model space .    in the regions of parameter space for which the sm - like higgs bottom and tau couplings are suppressed , analyzed in the small-@xmath28 scenario of fig .",
    "[ lhcsmallalphacombfig ] , the lhc will also be able to test the nonstandard higgs sector .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ lhcsmallalphacombnsfig ] , where the current 95% cl limit on the @xmath2-odd higgs mass is drawn as a dashed line . for the specific point we analyzed ,",
    "the current bounds already heavily constrain the region of parameters for which the branching ratio @xmath29 may be enhanced .",
    "this is a generic feature . in fig .",
    "[ lhcsmallalphacombnsfig ] we also show the projected reach of the @xmath22 channel with 5  fb@xmath0 per experiment . based on these results , we find that with the acquisition of 5  fb@xmath0/experiment , either the lhc will find both the sm - like higgs and evidence of non - standard higgs bosons , or the region in which the photon pair production is enhanced will be ruled out by both channels .",
    "in this article we have analyzed the 7 tev lhc capabilities to exclude , provide evidence for , or discover neutral higgs bosons in the mssm . at @xmath30 gev , in the maximal mixing scenario , for which the higgs mass is about 125 - 130  gev , the lhc is expected to discover or find evidence of a sm - like higgs boson ( the state provided by the doublet that is primarily responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking ) in a combination of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 channels with 5  fb@xmath0/experiment . in the same region of @xmath3 , evidence for @xmath7 is expected in the diphoton channel with @xmath33  fb@xmath0/experiment in the minimal mixing scenario , for which the higgs mass is about 115 - 120 gev . at lower values of @xmath3 , we have emphasized that the sm - like higgs can generically exhibit branching ratios different from those of the sm higgs in decays relevant for the main lhc search channels . in the most generic models for the soft parameters ,",
    "the @xmath15 modes are suppressed at low to moderate @xmath3 by a large increase in the @xmath14 width , an effect that is due to mixing between the two higgs doublets . in such cases",
    "we have shown that combinations with tevatron results and with nonstandard higgs boson searches at the lhc can provide an experimental handle on the parameter space .",
    "furthermore , with other specific choices of the soft parameters , the mixing can be such that the @xmath14 width is strongly suppressed , leading to an enhancement in the @xmath5 branching ratios , allowing the discovery of the sm - like higgs at 5  fb@xmath0 . because this feature is present at low @xmath3 and large @xmath24",
    "such models will be probed in the near future by the searches for standard and nonstandard higgs bosons .",
