    "optical squeezed states are used in many areas of quantum optics to improve the sensitivity of measurements to beyond the shot noise limit ( snl ) .",
    "for example , squeezed states can be used in interferometers  @xcite , spatial and spectroscopic measurements  @xcite , and potentially to improve the quantum noise limit of gravitational wave ( gw ) interferometers  @xcite .",
    "optical parametric amplifiers ( opa ) are often the systems of choice to produce squeezed states since , in theory , they can produce states with very high levels of squeezing .",
    "the level of squeezing that can be produced in these systems is limited by the introduction of noise from a variety of sources .",
    "the noise sources that have been reported to limit squeezing in these systems are pump noise  @xcite and seed noise  @xcite .    in experiments reported to date , the maximum amount of squeezing inferred before detection is around 7db  @xcite .",
    "this result , and in most results , the maximum squeezing is measured at sideband frequencies above 1mhz , rather than at lower frequencies where ideally , greater squeezing is predicted",
    ". there has been recent interest in producing squeezed states at lower frequencies , primarily for use in gravitational wave detectors . for such states",
    "the squeezing bandwidth should cover the gw detection band ( 10hz to 10khz ) .",
    "several results have been published below 300khz  @xcite with the lowest result 280hz  @xcite .",
    "these frequencies represent a different regime experimentally to the majority of squeezed state production and as such other potential limiting low frequency noise sources need to be considered .",
    "one such effect which is large at low frequencies in optical cavity systems is the photothermal - effect - induced noise  @xcite .",
    "this effect has not previously been reported in an opa system to our knowledge . by nature , photothermal effects are important at low frequencies and may be significant for limiting the generation of squeezed light in the gw detection band .",
    "this effect is investigated theoretically in an opa cavity system in this article .",
    "the photothermal effect can be described as the absorption of optical power in a medium causing a temperature change to the medium .",
    "this effect may be significant in most nonlinear crystals since many have relatively high absorption rates .",
    "for example , the crystal @xmath0 has the linear absorption rate of 4@xmath1@xmath2 at 532 nm  @xcite .",
    "high absorption rates coupled with the high circulating power required for strong nonlinearity result in a large amount of optical power absorbed into the crystal , which may cause a significant temperature change",
    ". the average temperature change due to the power absorbed in the crystal can be compensated for by using a temperature controller , and does not pose significant problems for most experimental systems .    instead , we focus our investigation on the effect of photothermally induced temperature fluctuations , caused by fluctuations in the circulating power in the opa cavity",
    ". the circulating power fluctuations could have classical and quantum origins , or in the case of a shot - noise - limited system , only quantum mechanical origin .",
    "the photothermal noise caused by thermal - expansive noise and thermal - refractive noise has two degrading effects on the production of squeezed light in the opa .",
    "the first effect is via fluctuations in the nonlinearity .",
    "this arises as the nonlinear strength is temperature dependent due to the phase matching condition .",
    "the second effect is via optical path length fluctuations .",
    "the temperature fluctuations cause the optical path length to change , potentially causing a detuning of the optical cavity .",
    "these effects appear as @xmath3 in variance , where @xmath4 is the thermal relaxation cutoff frequency of the nonlinear medium , and are therefore primarily significant at low frequencies .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in section  [ sect : field_equations ] , we write down the equations of motion for the fundamental and second - harmonic modes in an opa with extra terms required to take into account the photothermal effect . in section  [ sect : photothermal ] , we quantify the fluctuating photothermal effect . in section  [",
