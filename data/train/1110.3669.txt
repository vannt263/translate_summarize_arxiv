    "a different , `` foliated '' argument goes as follows : suppose that there exists a holomorphic line field transverse to @xmath1 ; this is a line bundle @xmath40 over @xmath1 , as we have seen in section 1 for each @xmath23 the line @xmath180 of @xmath40 is associated to a projective line @xmath181 of the projective plane ( this projective line passes through @xmath25 with direction given by @xmath180 ) .",
    "we take some riemannian metric in @xmath182 ; since there are neighborhoods of @xmath1 in @xmath40 and of @xmath1 in @xmath182 which are @xmath183 diffeomorphic ( as line bundles ) , for a small @xmath184 the discs centered at the points of @xmath1 of radius @xmath184 and contained in the projective lines @xmath185 are disjoint , so they form a holomorphic fibration .",

    "we observe that the extension is constant along each projective line @xmath181 .",
    "the only possibility is that these projective lines form a pencil issued from some point of the plane .",
    "proposition [ 25mar2011 ] implies that for a curve with sufficiently positive self - intersection we have at most one transverse holomorphic line field .",
    "the above example shows that such a line field may not exist at all .",
    "note that the construction of transverse line fields presented in proposition [ 25mar11 ] is done under the hypothesis that the curve has sufficiently negative self - intersection .",
    "the proposition [ atmostone ] is useful to get examples of non - existence of certain regular foliations when the self - intersection of @xmath1 is not sufficiently negative . in order to see this ,",
    "let us consider a pair @xmath0 obtained by the following procedure :    1 .",
    "we blow up the origin 0 of the polydisc @xmath186 , introducing an exceptional divisor ; we choose the point in this divisor which belongs to the strict transform of @xmath187 and blow up again .",
    "we keep doing this in order to get a chain of projective lines @xmath188 of self - intersection @xmath189 and a last projetive line @xmath190 of self - intersection @xmath191 ; there is a holomorphic projection @xmath192 from the resulting surface @xmath193 to @xmath194 , which collapses @xmath195 to 0 , and which is an isomorphism from the complement of this divisor to @xmath196 .",
    "denote by @xmath197 the point which belongs to the strict transform of @xmath187 and take the @xmath198-coordinate along @xmath190 in order to have @xmath199 .",
    "we take also a polydisc @xmath200 , for a small @xmath201 , around @xmath202 .",
    "2 .   let us consider a line bundle over a compact , holomorphic , smooth curve @xmath203 whose self - intersection satisfies @xmath204 ; we select some point in @xmath205 and introduce coordinates @xmath206 in a neighborhood @xmath207 of this point as to have @xmath208 contained in the linear fiber through @xmath209 for every @xmath210 .",
    "finally we glue @xmath207 to @xmath18 by means of a holomorphic diffeomorphism @xmath211 in order to get a holomorphic surface @xmath212 containing @xmath213 as a divisor whose components have the self - intersection numbers described above ; @xmath214 must send @xmath215 to @xmath216 , the @xmath210-axis into the @xmath217-axis and the @xmath218-axis transversely to the @xmath198-axis .",
    "we remark that @xmath205 has a unique field @xmath219 of transversal lines because @xmath220 ; by construction the line @xmath221 is different from @xmath222 .",

    "we develop here example [ example1 ] in order to understand the role of tangencies .",
    "let us consider in @xmath237 a smooth algebraic curve @xmath1 of degree @xmath238 and a holomorphic line field @xmath239 along @xmath1 .",
    "we have then a holomorphic map @xmath240 defined as @xmath241 ; its image is an algebraic curve @xmath242 . let us denote by @xmath243 the degree of @xmath244 as a map from @xmath1 onto @xmath245 .",
    "for instance , let us suppose that @xmath239 is induced by a pencil of lines issued from some point @xmath246 . then @xmath245 is a line in @xmath247 and @xmath248 has degree @xmath238 or @xmath249 according to @xmath250 or @xmath251 ( in this last case , @xmath252 is the tangent line to @xmath1 at @xmath253 .",
