    "in general , quantum field theories have been built in the context of local models .",
    "however , there exist physical situations that lead to non local interactions in a straightforward way .",
    "let us mention , for instance , wheeler and feynman s description of charged particles @xcite , string theories with non local vertices @xcite , and non local kinetic terms that appear when bosonizing fermions in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions @xcite @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , several recently considered non local field theories are related to the study of electronic systems in one spatial dimension ( 1d ) @xcite @xcite .",
    "indeed , in recent years the physics of 1d systems of strongly correlated particles has become a very interesting subject since one can take advantage of the simplicity of the models at hand and , at the same time , expect to make contact with experiments .",
    "for instance , the recently discovered carbon nanotubes are perfect experimental realizations of 1d conductors @xcite . on the other hand , as the dimensionality of a system decreases , charge screening effects become less important and the long - range interaction between electrons is expected to play a central role in determining the properties of the system .",
    "in fact , from a theoretical point of view the effects of long - range interactions have been recently discussed in connection to several problems such as the fermi - edge singularity @xcite , the insulator - metal transition @xcite , the role of the lattice through umklapp scattering and size dependent effects @xcite , etc . in the specific context of carbon nanotubes ,",
    "a low - energy theory including coulomb interactions has been also recently derived and analyzed @xcite .",
    "non local fermionic models have been also used in the study of fluctuation effects in low - dimensional spin - peierls systems @xcite .    as shown in @xcite ,",
    "starting from a non - local and non - covariant version of the thirring model @xcite , in which the fermionic densities and currents are coupled through bilocal , distance - dependent potentials , one can make direct contact with the `` g - ology '' model @xcite currently used to describe different scattering processes characterized by coupling functions @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "when one bosonizes this theory by either operational or functional methods , due to the contributions of @xmath3 ( backscattering ) @xcite and @xmath5 ( umklapp ) @xcite one finds an even more drastic departure from the local case .",
    "indeed , instead of the well - known integrable sine - gordon model ( sg ) one gets a non local extension of it , which , as far as we know , is not exactly solvable .",
    "recently , in ref.@xcite , the physical content of this model was explored by using the self - consistent harmonic approximation ( scha ) @xcite . as it is well - known",
    "the scha is a non controlled approximation , i.e. there is no perturbative parameter involved .",
    "it is then desirable to have an alternative analysis of this problem .",
    "this is the main motivation of the present work .",
    "we will apply the renormalization group ( rg ) technique @xcite , usually employed in local cases , to the non local sine - gordon model ( nlsg ) mentioned above . for simplicity",
    "we shall assume that non locality plays a role only in umklapp interactions ( @xmath5 ) whereas all other potentials are local , i.e. proportional to delta functions . in section 2",
    "we briefly show how the nlsg action is obtained from the non local thirring model . in section 3",
    "we derive the rg equations and compute the gap in the charge - density spectrum .",
    "this allows us to determine the effect of non contact @xmath5 couplings .",
    "finally , in section 4 , we discuss our results .",
    "let us sketch the derivation of the nlsg action .",
    "we start from the fermionic ( 1 + 1)-dimensional quantum field theory with euclidean action given by    @xmath7    where    @xmath8    is the unperturbed action associated to a linearized free dispersion relation .",
    "the contributions of the different scattering processes can be written as    @xmath9    and    @xmath10    where the @xmath11 are the usual two - dimensional dirac matrices and @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "the coupling potentials @xmath14 and @xmath15 are assumed to depend on the distance @xmath16 and can be expressed in terms of `` g - ology '' parameters as    @xmath17    in the above equations @xmath18 and @xmath19 are just numerical constants that could be set equal to one .",
    "we keep them to facilitate comparison of our results with those corresponding to the usual thirring model .",
    "indeed , this case is obtained by choosing @xmath20 and @xmath21 . on the other hand , the non - covariant limit @xmath20",
    ", @xmath22 gives one version ( @xmath23 ) of the tl model @xcite .",
    "the terms in the action containing @xmath4 and @xmath6 represent forward scattering events , in which the associated momentum transfer is small . in the @xmath4",
    "processes the two branches ( left and right - moving particles ) are coupled , whereas in the @xmath6 processes all four participating electrons belong to the same branch . on the other hand , @xmath3 and @xmath5",
    "are related to scattering diagrams with larger momentum transfers of the order of @xmath24 ( bs ) and @xmath25 ( us ) respectively ( this last contribution is important only if the band is half - filled ) . for simplicity , throughout this paper we will consider spinless electrons .",
    "the extension of our results to the spin-@xmath26 case with spin - flipping interactions , though not trivial , could be done by following the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite .    at this point",
    "we consider the partition function @xmath27 expressed as a functional integral over fermionic variables .",
    "the implementation of a generalized hubbard - stratonovich identity @xcite allows to write @xmath27 in terms of a fermionic determinant .",
    "although this determinant is highly non trivial , one can combine a chiral change in the fermionic path - integral measure with a formal expansion in @xmath28 in order to obtain a bosonic representation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "one thus establishes an equivalence between the original fermionic action and the following bosonic action depending on five scalars @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 : @xmath34\\\\ + \\frac{1}{2}{\\int d^2x\\,d^2y\\,}c_{\\mu } ( x ) u^{-1}_{(\\mu)}(x , y ) c_{\\mu } ( y ) + \\frac{{g ' } \\lambda c}{\\pi } { \\int d^2x\\ , } [ c_{(0 ) } ( x)f_{0}(x ) + i c_{(1 ) } ( x)f_{1}(x ) ] \\label{39}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 \\\\",
    "b(p)&=\\frac{1}{2}\\left[p_0 ^2 \\hat{v}_{(0)}^{-1 } ( p ) + p_1 ^2 ( \\hat{v}_{(1)}^{-1 } ( p ) - \\frac{g^2}{\\pi})\\right ] \\\\",
    "c(p)&=p_0p_1\\left(\\hat{v}_{(0)}^{-1 } ( p)- \\hat{v}_{(1)}^{-1 } ( p ) + \\frac{g^2}{\\pi}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath36    since the integrals in @xmath31 and @xmath32 are quadratic these fields are easily integrated out and one gets    @xmath37 } \\label{41}\\ ] ]    with    @xmath38 = s_{0 } + s_{int } \\label{42}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath39\\ ] ]    @xmath40\\\\ -\\frac{(\\lambda c)^2}{2\\pi^2}{\\int d^2x\\,d^2y\\,}g_{3 } ( x , y ) \\cos\\left[\\sqrt{4 \\pi}(\\varphi(x ) + \\varphi ( y ) ) -2i g ( \\phi(x ) + \\phi(y))\\right].\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    it is now convenient to diagonalize the quadratic part of the effective action by introducing the fields @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 :    @xmath44    where we have defined @xmath45 and @xmath46",
    ". we then obtain    @xmath47 , \\label{44}\\ ] ]    @xmath48\\\\-\\frac{(\\lambda c)^2}{2\\pi^2}{\\int d^2x\\,d^2y\\,}g_{3 } ( x , y ) \\cos\\sqrt{4\\pi}[\\phi(x ) + \\phi ( y)].\\label{45}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    one can see that the @xmath41 and @xmath42 fields become completely decoupled from @xmath43 . moreover , it becomes apparent that the @xmath43-dependent piece of the action @xmath49 is the only one containing potentially relevant contributions ( i.e. gapped modes ) .",
    "in this section we shall focus our attention on the non local action derived above . for simplicity , from now on we will consider the case in which @xmath50 and @xmath51 are constants ( local forward scattering ) and @xmath52 , i.e. a pure non local umklapp interaction .",
    "thus , we start from the action @xmath53={\\int\\frac{d^2p}{(2\\pi)^2}\\,}\\phi(p)\\frac{f(p)}{2}\\phi(-p ) -\\frac{(\\lambda c)^2}{2\\pi^2}{\\int d^2x\\,d^2y\\,}g_3(x , y)\\cos\\sqrt{4\\pi}[\\phi(x)+\\phi(y)]\\label{46}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] with    @xmath54    where we have now expressed all formulae in terms of @xmath18 coupling functions . in the local case ( @xmath55 ) the action ( [ 46 ] ) corresponds to the well - known sine - gordon model , which is an integrable , exactly solvable field theory .",
    "in particular , a rg analysis shows that the  stiffness constant \" , @xmath56 has to be lower than @xmath57 in order to have a relevant cosine interaction , i.e. to have a gap in the spectrum .",
    "recently , by reinterpreting bethe - ansatz results , zamolodchikov obtained the exact expression for this gap @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , as far as we know , the present non local version of the theory is not exactly soluble and one is then forced to consider an approximation . in ref .",
    "@xcite a scha was employed in order to estimate the energy gap .",
    "but this is a non controlled , non perturbative approximation . besides this general disadvantage ,",
    "the implementation of the scha technique led to a set of coupled algebraic equations that could be numerically solved only for very weak non locality .",
    "it is then natural to try another method to attack the problem and eventually improve the approximation .",
    "let us consider the wilsonian approach to the rg ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "first of all we restrict our analysis to a non local interaction of the form : @xmath58 with @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the second derivative of the delta function with respect to @xmath61 . at this point",
    "it is worth mentioning that rg calculations involving fermionic non local interactions already exist in the literature .",
    "for instance , the authors of ref.@xcite used a jordan - wigner fermion representation for the 1d heisenberg - ising model which includes not only a non local fermion - fermion interaction but also a linear fermion - lattice coupling . due to the curvature of the band , the non trivial fermion - lattice coupling and the presence of both forward and umklapp scattering , comparison of their rg equations with ours",
    "is not straightforward .",
    "let us point out , however , that in @xcite fermions corresponding to nearest - neighbor lattice sites interact through a potential of the form @xmath62 , i.e. a unique constant @xmath63 is associated to @xmath64 . as shown in the above equation ( [ g3 ] ) , in the present work we are interested in a coupling which depends at least on two constants @xmath65 and @xmath66 . in fact , the derivation of rg equations for these coupling constants will be our next task .    in condensed matter problems",
    "one is usually interested in the physics at long distances , compared to a lattice spacing of the order of @xmath67 . since",
    ", in momentum space , this corresponds to small @xmath68 , it is natural to consider correlations between fields with momenta @xmath69 , with s very large .",
    "these are the so called `` slow modes '' @xmath70 . on the other hand ,",
    "the `` fast modes '' @xmath71 are those carrying momenta that satisfy @xmath72 . in the present approach to rg these fast modes are integrated in the path integral framework , giving rise to an effective theory depending only on slow modes . from this action , in turn , one can read the flow equations for the couplings . indeed , writing the initial action as @xmath73 , to first order , after a suitable rescaling of coordinates and momenta and a redefinition of the fields ( see the appendix for details ) we obtain the following relationship between the original and rg transformed actions : @xmath74\\delta^2(x - y)-\\frac{\\epsilon - 4 k \\epsilon",
    "t}{\\lambda^2}\\,\\partial_1 ^ 2\\delta^2(x - y ) \\right)\\times \\\\ \\times \\cos\\sqrt{4\\pi}(\\phi(x ) + \\phi ( y ) ) = \\\\",
    "= \\frac{(\\lambda c)^2}{2\\pi^2}\\int d^{2}x\\,d^{2}y\\left(\\lambda \\delta^2 ( x - y)-\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\lambda^2}\\,\\partial_1 ^ 2\\delta^2(x - y)\\right ) \\cos\\sqrt{4\\pi}(\\phi(x ) + \\phi ( y ) ) = s_{int}^{'}.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    as usual , imposing the invariance of the action under rg , we get the flow equations for the couplings @xmath65 and @xmath66 :    @xmath75    @xmath76    where @xmath77 , with the initial conditions @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the solution of this system is elementary , yielding : @xmath80 + k \\epsilon_{0}\\exp[-4 k t],\\ ] ] @xmath81.\\ ] ] from the last equation one clearly sees that the non local piece of the interaction is irrelevant , as expected .",
    "concerning the local interaction one sees that it is relevant for @xmath82 , i.e. non locality does not modify this well - known condition already found for the local sg model .",
    "therefore , for @xmath82 , @xmath65 will grow with increasing t and there will be a gap in the cd spectrum which can be estimated by determining the value @xmath83 for which @xmath84 . from now on we shall restrict our analysis to the case @xmath82 .",
    "the gap is then given by @xmath85 , where @xmath86 .",
    "it is also convenient to define the dimensionless gap @xmath87 . from equation ( [ rg3 ] )",
    "one can thus derive an equation for @xmath88 which gives the behavior of the energy gap as function of the forward scattering potentials ( @xmath56 ) and the non local contribution of the umklapp scattering ( @xmath89 ) . before analyzing this non trivial equation it seems reasonable to check if it predicts sensible results for the local case . to this end",
    "we set @xmath90 and @xmath91 in ( [ rg3 ] ) , obtaining : @xmath92 this result can be compared with the exact solution obtained by zamolodchikov @xcite and with the approximated result given by the scha method @xcite .",
    "the corresponding expressions for the gap are respectively given by : @xmath93 and @xmath94 in order to compare @xmath95 and @xmath96 with @xmath97 in an efficient and easy to visualize way , we have computed the relative error @xmath98 as function of @xmath56 for both approximations .",
    "the results are depicted in fig.1 where one sees that our rg computation gives values of the gap closer to the exact values for a wide range of the stiffness constant @xmath56 .",
    "interestingly , the scha result works well when one approaches the end points of the interval .",
    "going back to the case @xmath99 , by combining eqs.([rg1 ] ) and ( [ rg2 ] ) one readily gets a phase diagram in the @xmath100 plane ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . there is a critical line given by @xmath101 .",
    "if the initial parameters are tuned to lie on this line , the system will flow to the tomonaga - luttinger fixed point , at the origin . in this case , of course , the system remains gapless . on the other hand ,",
    "for initial conditions outside the critical line , the system flows to strong coupling , giving rise to a gap @xmath88 , as mentioned above . for simplicity",
    "let us consider the case @xmath102 and define the variable @xmath103 .",
    "the gap equation can then be written as @xmath104 where @xmath105 .",
    "this equation is one of our main results . for fixed values of @xmath56 and @xmath106",
    "it gives the behaviour of the energy gap as function of the non local contribution to umklapp scattering , associated to non contact interactions .",
    "the form of this formula suggests that it could be easier to handle the inverted equation : @xmath107 where @xmath108 . in fig.3",
    "we show the numerical solution of this last equation for @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "we see that @xmath111 decreases for increasing @xmath89 , in qualitative agreement with the scha prediction @xcite .",
    "a quantitative comparison between both approximations is given in fig.4 , for the same fixed values of @xmath106 and @xmath56 .",
    "since the scha result obtained in @xcite is valid for small values of the coefficient associated to non locality , we have plotted the solutions in the interval @xmath112 .",
    "we find that the gap decay predicted by rg , for increasing non locality , is much slower than the one obtained through the gaussian approximation .    as a final comment",
    ", we note that the rg treatment for non local interactions depicted in this work can be extended to a more general coupling function including an arbitrary number of even powers of @xmath113 . in coordinate space",
    "such an interaction can be written as @xmath114 where @xmath115 .",
    "the corresponding set of rg equations for the @xmath116 can be obtained from the expansion of the cosine integral function which appears when one integrates the fast modes after the mode separation ( see appendix ) .",
    "the result is    @xmath117    the general solution of this system can be expressed as a combination of exponentials and the computation of the gap can not be done , in principle , in an analytical way .",
    "it is then illustrative to consider a particular case in which this calculation is simplified .",
    "indeed , for small @xmath118 , it can be proved by induction that the solutions of this system of equations are of the form :    @xmath119.\\ ] ]    in this limit one obtains the following expression for the gap : @xmath120 which is consistent with the conditions @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "in this paper we have considered a non local extension of the sine - gordon model .",
    "this theory is obtained when one bosonizes a non local and non covariant version of the thirring model used to describe certain 1d many - body systems .",
    "since the integrability of this non local sine - gordon model has not been proved , one needs to implement some approximation to study its physical content .",
    "we have performed a rg calculation up to first order in the coupling function @xmath5 , which in a condensed matter context is associated to the so called umklapp scattering .",
    "we obtained an expression for the energy gap as function of the non local piece of the interaction @xmath123 . for purely local interactions ( the exactly solvable sg ) our result seems to be a sensible approximation , improving the scha predictions for a wide range of forward interactions . in the non local case , in which no exact answer is known , we predict decreasing values for the gap for increasing values of @xmath123 , in qualitative agreement with a previous scha computation .",
    "we were able to give a precise comparison between both approximations in the interval @xmath124 , showing that the gap decrease , for increasing non locality , is much weaker according to the rg computation .",
    "since , as is well - known , the scha method is not a controlled approximation , the present results contribute to a better understanding of the physics of non local field theories .",
    "we think that our results are also of interest in the context of 1d many - body systems ( luttinger liquids ) in which most of the previous investigations involving umklapp scattering do not consider non local effects associated to long range interactions @xcite .",
    "this work was partially supported by universidad nacional de la plata and consejo nacional de investigaciones cientficas y tcnicas , conicet ( argentina ) .",
    "in order to illustrate the computation leading to the flow equations we first define the free bosonic propagator :        the next step is the analysis of @xmath49 , as given by the second term of equation ( [ 46 ] ) . for simplicity , in this appendix",
    "we disregard the overall constant @xmath128 .",
