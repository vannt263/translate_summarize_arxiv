    "ads / cft relates a set of conformal field theories to gravitational theories in ads @xcite .",
    "interesting field theory dynamics follows from simple relevant deformations of these cfts .",
    "the inclusion of multi - trace deformations has lead to many results @xcite , and in particular to recent attempts to drive a theory across a quantum phase transition @xcite . in addition , the role of multi - trace deformations in the holographic renormalization group has recently been emphasized in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . as a result , one would like to have as complete an understanding as possible of which multi - trace deformations are allowed , and when they can lead to useful dynamics .",
    "linear scalars in ads offer a good starting point for such analyses . within the bf window @xmath1",
    "there are two possible boundary conditions preserving conformal invariance @xcite , often called the standard and alternate quantizations @xcite .",
    "these fixed points are characterized by the existence of a single trace operator with dimensions @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively , where @xmath4 . from the bulk perspective",
    ", it is natural to think of these as generalized dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions respectively .",
    "there are many other boundary conditions that do not preserve conformal invariance but which correspond to multi - trace deformations of the aforementioned choices @xcite .",
    "for example , when it is relevant , the double trace deformation leads to an rg flow between the alternative and standard theories with the former being a uv fixed point and the later an ir fixed point .",
    "the obstruction to playing these games for @xmath5 ( outside the bf window ) is that the existence of the alternative fixed point would require an operator whose dimension is below the unitarity bound ( i.e. , @xmath6 ) .",
    "it is thus natural to suppose that only the standard fixed point exists in this regime .",
    "the details were studied in @xcite which largely confirmed this picture , though it should be remarked that the exact issued identified at the supposed alternative fixed point was not the existence of a ghost but , instead , an ir divergence and an associated null mode .",
    "nevertheless , ghosts do appear when this theory is deformed in various ways , including in both choosing the boundary metric to enact an ir cut - off and the addition of double - trace operators .",
    "it is thus hard to make sense of this fixed point and , indeed , at first glance it may also seem hard to make sense of double trace deformations of the standard fixed point .",
    "this result seems at odds with recent discussions of holographic fermi surfaces and quantum criticality @xcite .",
    "the reason for concern can be abstracted as follows to the setting of a scalar in ads .",
    "suppose that we couple the cft in standard quantization to a propagating boundary scalar field .",
    "consider : @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the action of the dual cft which contains an operator @xmath9 of dimension @xmath10 .",
    "note that the bf window corresponds to @xmath11 .",
    "the free operator dimension of @xmath12 is @xmath13 ( based on power counting using a canonical kinetic term ) from which the dimension of @xmath14 is @xmath15 ; thus the interaction term is relevant for @xmath11 . in this case",
    "we can ignore the kinetic term in the ir and integrate out @xmath12 ( treating it as non - propagating ) .",
    "this fixes @xmath16 and upon substitution in the action one finds @xmath17 which is just a double trace deformation of the cft in standard quantization .",
    "furthermore , sending @xmath18 corresponds to the uv fixed point , which is the alternative quantization .",
    "that is , for @xmath11 we may construct the alternate quantization from a good theory by starting with ( [ eq : couple ] ) , dropping the kinetic terms ( setting @xmath19 ) and sending @xmath20 .",
    "the mode @xmath12 , which is being integrated over , plays the role of an operator in @xmath21 with dimension @xmath3 ( from power counting with respect to the coupling term after setting @xmath22 = 0 $ ] ) .",
    "it also enacts the legendre transformation which relates the two theories @xcite .",
    "let us attempt to continue these arguments to @xmath23 .",
    "it is no longer valid to integrate out @xmath12 due to the importance of the kinetic terms . indeed , since @xmath24 in the ir we find the low energy theory is a cft decoupled from a free scalar field .",
    "the regime where one might expect to obtain a good theory is @xmath25 ( so that the decoupled scalar sector is ghost free ) . on the other hand , any @xmath26 should be allowed as @xmath27 simply induces condensation of the field @xmath28 without pathology , at least so long as appropriate higher order interaction terms ( such as @xmath29 ) are present .",
    "unfortunately , it turns out that ghosts appear even for @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "this may be seen by examining the two - point function of @xmath12 which , using large-@xmath30 factorization ( see for example @xcite ) , is given by @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the two point function of @xmath33 in the interacting cft .",
    "conformal invariance fixes @xmath34 ( where @xmath35 ) and the condition that the spectral density @xmath36 be positive for @xmath37 further requires @xmath38 .",
    "let us now examine @xmath39 for potential ghosts . for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict to the case @xmath40 ( where @xmath41 ) , though we expect similar results for larger @xmath42 .",
    "this case was studied explicitly in @xcite , which showed that ghosts arise for all values of @xmath26 and @xmath43 ( though we discuss only @xmath44 here ) . for @xmath45",
    "there is always a tachyonic pole with @xmath46 .",
    "expanding @xmath47 around this pole one can show that it has a negative residue . for @xmath27",
    "there are now two poles , which for large enough @xmath26 merge and move into the complex plane . in the real case one of these two poles is a ghost while the other is a non - ghost tachyon . as usual ,",
    "the complex case necessarily contains a ghost .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is clear that no ghost is present for @xmath48 studying the change in the corresponding pole perturbatively in @xmath14 would not have indicated the presence of ghosts .",
    "this suggests that the ghosts correspond to new poles that enter from @xmath49 and thus that , at least in some sense , they are a uv issue .",
    "indeed , since the coupling between the cft and @xmath12 is governed by an irrelevant interaction we expect to run into problems at energy scales above : @xmath50 one can show that the ghost found using ( [ eq : semi ] ) for @xmath51 always satisfies @xmath52 where which maximizes the expression @xmath53 , associated with the case @xmath54 . ]",
    "@xmath55 is a number which depends only on @xmath42 .",
    "so it is natural to expect that cutting off ( or appropriately modifying ) the theory at @xmath56 will banish our ghosts .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to construct examples in which this can be demonstrated precisely . but let us first comment on some related examples already known in the literature .",
    "the low energy theory for the fermions analyzed in @xcite and identified in @xcite was given by an action similar to ( [ eq : couple ] ) .",
    "the free fermion plays the role of our free scalar above , and the relativistic cft above is replaced by the strongly coupled theory dual to @xmath57 ( or an interesting generalization thereof ) .",
    "although the details are different , there were again two interesting cases distinguished by conditions analogous to the cases @xmath11 and @xmath5 above . in the former case the fermion kinetic terms could be ignored and the theory describes a non - fermi liquid without a well defined quasiparticle . in the later case the kinetic terms could not be ignored , resulting in a low energy fermionic quasiparticle different from , but similar to , a landau fermi liquid . for the case with a quasiparticle excitation it seems likely that the low energy effective",
    "action in @xcite leads to a propagator with ghost - poles .",
    "however , the saving grace in this case is the presence of a natural uv cutoff . recall that the full background considered in @xcite was just the extremal reissner nordstrom charged black hole .",
    "this background can be thought of as a domain wall solution between @xmath58 and @xmath57 , with the transition happening at an energy scale @xmath59 set by the chemical potential .",
    "this @xmath59 provides an effective uv cutoff on the @xmath57 theory .",
    "the kinetic terms ( analogous to @xmath43 ) and @xmath14 were computed in @xcite and one may check that they satisfy @xmath60 . as a result ,",
    "the above prediction of ghosts ( based on analyzing the low energy action ) is not reliable and one must instead consider the full rg flow .    in this way",
    ", the action ( [ eq : couple ] ) may generally be taken to model the ir regime of a domain wall flow between two different scale invariant fixed points .",
    "the low energy theory then naturally comes with a cutoff @xmath61 ; the scale where the domain wall begins to deviate from the ir fixed point .",
    "so long as we start with a good theory in the uv , we expect the _ full _ theory to be ghost - free .",
    "but it is easy to engineer models in which the ir fixed point has a field satisfying @xmath5 ( for the appropriately defined @xmath42 ) subject to an irrelevant double - trace deformation . in this case",
    "our discussion above implies that the low - energy effective kinetic terms and the low energy coupling will satisfy @xmath62 .",
    "the problem of the existence of negative norm states can be studied systematically on a case by case basis . here",
    "we take a much simpler approach and study the @xmath63 theory with a radial cutoff .",
    "this problem is then a simple generalization of the analysis in @xcite whose results will confirm the above intuition .",
    "this in turn increases one s confidence in the theories studied in @xcite .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in section [ ref ] we introduce a simple ` reference ' system involving a free scalar on the poincar patch of ads subject to a specific _ radial _ cut - off . while this is not equivalent to a uv cut - off ( since arbitrarily high momenta along the boundary are still allowed ) , it corresponds to a non - trivial ( and non - local , see e.g. @xcite ) deformation of an appropriate dual cft defined by removing the radial cut - off",
    "this theory is easy to study and ghost - free , but it is ill - defined at the quantum level due to an ir divergence in the two - point function ( of the sort seen in @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "section [ def thy ] then studies a two - parameter family of ( quadratic ) deformations of our reference theory .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that , without the radial cut - off , these deformations remove the ir divergence but also introduce ghosts .",
    "nevertheless , we show that ( at least in a certain regime of parameter space ) the ghosts may be banished by imposing a suitably strong radial cut - off .",
    "we close with some final discussion in section [ disc ] , which in particular shows that the models of section [ def thy ] suffice to give a ghost - free uv - modified version of all models studied in @xcite for which a certain uv coupling is positive .",
    "as stated above , the explicit model that we will study is that of a scalar field @xmath64 on ( poincar ) @xmath65 .",
    "we impose a radial cut - off at some @xmath66 in coordinates associated with the metric @xmath67 in particular , we take @xmath68 and note that @xmath69 is the poincar horizon .",
    "we focus on the mass range @xmath70 . for the moment , we analyze only a specific choice of boundary conditions discussed below . while this will turn out to lead to an ill - defined quantum theory , it is easy to study and will be of use in section [ def thy ] as a convenient reference system about which to deform .    to facilitate contact with the case @xmath71 ( no cut - off ) , we write the action in a form that parallels the @xmath71 action for neumann boundary conditions ( see @xcite ) , @xmath72 , \\ ] ] where @xmath73 $ ] , @xmath74 , @xmath75 denotes the surface @xmath66 and @xmath76 is the unit normal to this surface ( we denote the normal derivative by @xmath77 below ) .",
    "the boundary conditions must be chosen to make @xmath78 stationary .",
    "varying ( [ i n ] ) with respect to @xmath64 we obtain the boundary condition so that the b.c . plays the role of a source in the dual theory . ]",

    "@xmath86 is the dalembertian associated with the flat boundary metric , i.e. @xmath87 .    using the prescription of @xcite , we can read off the inner product associated with the action , including necessary contributions from the boundary kinetic terms on @xmath75 .",
    "we take the bulk klein - gordon current associated with a pair of solutions @xmath88 to be @xmath89 and introduce a corresponding boundary current @xmath90 where @xmath91 and the index @xmath92 ranges only over boundary directions .",

    "this eigenvalue may be used to classify the modes as ( @xmath103 ) , light - like ( @xmath104 ) and space - like or tachyonic ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "we will also consider the possibility of complex @xmath106 , and refer to the associated modes as  complex tachyons \" below .",

    "the radial profiles oscillate rapidly near the poincar horizon and it can be shown both solutions are plane - wave normalizable with respect to the inner product , see e.g. @xcite .",

    "the solution is completely specified by noting that the boundary condition ( [ bc r0 puren ] ) imposes a @xmath113-dependent relation between @xmath108 and @xmath109 , whose explicit form will not be important for the moment .",
    "the norm of these modes follows from expression and can be computed by the methods of @xcite and @xmath114 . but",
    "a self - adjointness argument requires the result to be proportional to a dirac delta - function , which can come only from the region near the horizon where the modes are plane - wave normalizeable .",

    "we reproduce the boundary condition @xmath116 , the uv behavior of ( [ ip general bc ] ) is guaranteed to agree with the neumann result of @xcite .    on the other hand ,",

    "as expected , the leading small momentum behavior is not modified by the radial cut - off at @xmath113 .",
    "but the second expression in ( [ 2pt ir n ] ) means that our reference theory suffers from the same ir divergence in the bulk two - point function identified in @xcite for @xmath119 ( this divergence also appeared in the pure cft context in @xcite ) .",
    "thus the theory is ill - defined at the quantum level .",
    "let us nevertheless complete the mode analysis for this theory .",
    "we next consider the light - like modes , i.e. @xmath120 , whose general profile is @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 are arbitrary constants .",

    "in addition , we exhibited a simple new class of examples in which the ghosts are banished by imposing a _ radial _ cut - off on the ads space . as discussed in @xcite , this corresponds to a non - local uv modification of the usual cft dual to bulk ads .",
    "we found a two - parameter family of such theories corresponding to further quadratic deformations which are ghost - free in a certain regime of parameter space .",
    "in particular , gathering the results found in the previous sections , leads to the phase diagram shown in figure [ pd ] . here",
    ", regions i and ii ( i.e. @xmath187 ) constitute the ghost - free regime .",
    "more specifically , in region i there are only time - like excitations whereas in region ii there is a non - ghost tachyon . on the dividing line @xmath225",
    "a light - like mode of zero norm is present with the associated ir divergence in the 2-point function .",
    "the remaining regions contain ghosts : in region iii there are two real momentum tachyons , one of which is a ghosts ; in region iv there are two complex tachyons , whose presence is tied to ghosts , as explained above ; finally , in region v there is one real tachyon with negative norm . here",
    "the dotted line that marks the boundary between the regions with two real ( iii ) and two complex tachyons ( iv ) is to be considered very approximate .",
    "we have not investigated this boundary in detail , though the fact that @xmath226 is positive for @xmath227 and vanishes for @xmath228 shows that it lies to the right of the @xmath26-axis and terminates at the origin . for small @xmath177 we can send the cutoff @xmath113 to zero and",
    "the boundary between region iii and iv satisfies @xmath229 .    ]",
    "it is natural to ask whether a similar simple radial cut - off can banish more general ghosts .",
    "consider for example the addition of a new term to @xmath230 involving @xmath231 ( a @xmath232 term with coefficient @xmath233 ) .",
    "the higher order boundary condition will then give rise to additional ghosts .",
    "our preliminary numerical investigations indicate that for @xmath234 there are no values of @xmath235 for which the theory is ghost - free , so that the ability to banish ghosts by using a simple radial cut - off is not generic .",
    "however , it is again likely that for at least some values of the parameters that a more complicated uv modification of the ir fixed point ( such as that associated with rg flow from a good uv theory ) that renders the theory ghost - free .",
    "we conclude by making explicit the sense in which the radial cut - off theories of section [ def thy ] are uv modifications of a theory with no cut - off .",
    "this may be done by comparing the two point functions of the theories with finite and vanishing @xmath113 in the deep ir , which we take to mean @xmath236 .",
    "this is in turn equivalent to studying expression ( [ ip general bc ] ) for the norms at small @xmath106 .",
    "we take the cut - off free theory to be given by the same action @xmath130 with couplings @xmath237 and @xmath119 .",
    "as noted in section [ def thy ] , our parametrization was chosen to behave smoothly as @xmath85 .",
    "the first two leading order terms in these two - point functions agree if we identify @xmath238 and @xmath239 as @xmath113-dependent functions of @xmath240 through    @xmath241    @xmath242}{2 \\kappa_c ( \\nu^2 - 1)(1 + r_0^{2\\nu } \\tilde{\\lambda})^2 } \\approx \\frac{2 \\nu}{\\nu + 1 } , \\ ] ]    where we have displayed the behavior for large @xmath113 .",
    "thus we see that given any @xmath243 and any positive the couplings diverge at @xmath244 , and the theories at each side of the pole are not smoothly connected as we vary @xmath113 . ]",
    "@xmath245 in the @xmath119 theory , for large @xmath113 the ir behavior is described by the universal values @xmath246 and @xmath247 since our analysis holds for @xmath248 we have @xmath249 and @xmath250 . in this sense , subjecting such @xmath119 theories to a radial cut - off at large @xmath113 renders them both ghost- and tachyon - free .    the expressions ( [ lambda tilde ] ) and ( [ kappa tilde ] ) can be interpreted as rg flows for the couplings @xmath214 and @xmath224 as a function of the cutoff @xmath113 .",
    "indeed they are solutions to the rg equations of @xcite where the multi - trace couplings ( or in the language of @xcite the boundary action @xmath251 ) are truncated to second order in boundary derivatives .",
    "the constant @xmath252 and @xmath253 are integration constants .",
    "since the wilsonian rg equations of @xcite are exact , and since the spectrum does not change under exact rg , the full solutions that include all higher derivative couplings ( but which continue to fix all other couplings to zero in the @xmath254 theory ) would necessarily describe radial cut - off theories with ghosts .",
    "in this case it is the truncation that leads to a well - defined ghost - free theory .",
