    "<S> casimir forces are typically attractive , acting along symmetry directions ( _ e.g. _ , the normal to the interacting surfaces @xcite ) . however , </S>",
    "<S> if the surfaces are corrugated , these forces may have a component parallel to the surface , which is commonly referred to as _ lateral _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lateral casimir force has been successfully measured and has been argued to enable interesting applications such as contactless transmission of lateral motion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the force still acts along local surface - normal directions and arises due to the broken mirror symmetry introduced by the corrugations . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it strongly depends on the mutual geometric lateral displacement between the corrugations on both surfaces , becoming zero when they are aligned and the lateral mirror symmetry is recovered . an alternative symmetry breaking leading to lateral forces </S>",

    "<S> the force does not depend on the lateral position of the particle due to the translational invariance of the surface and is consistent with the frictional force predicted to exist between surfaces in relative uniform motion @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the origin of this force can be traced back to the recently discovered spin - direction locking of electromagnetic evanescent waves @xcite , an example of spin - orbit coupling of light @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> lateral optical forces @xcite naturally arise from an asymmetric scattering by circularly polarized dipoles into electromagnetic modes of any neighboring surface or waveguide @xcite . in a similar way , the rotating particle experiences an imbalance between left- and right - handed helicities in the vacuum and thermal fluctuations associated with its electromagnetic response , which ultimately leads to the lateral casimir force predicted in this work .    </S>",
