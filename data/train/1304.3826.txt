    "in this section , we propose a transmission strategy that is based on multi - layer transmission and hybrid relaying .",
    "hybrid relaying is performed by having each relay forward part of the decoded messages , which amounts to partial decode - and - forward ( df ) , along with a compressed version of the received signal , thus adhering also to the compress - and - forward ( cf ) paradigm .",
    "the multi - layer strategy used at the source is designed so as to facilitate decoding at the destination based on the information received from the relays , as detailed below .",
    "the amount of information decodable at the relays depends on the generally different fading powers @xmath18 . to leverage the different channel qualities , we enable flexible decoding at the relays by adopting a multi - layer transmission strategy at the encoder . this approach was also considered in @xcite for the case of two relays that communicate to the decoder via multiple access gaussian channels .",

    "the following conditions are sufficient to guarantee that rates @xmath40 are decodable by the relays @xcite @xmath41 for @xmath36 .",
    "this is because , by ( [ eq : broadcast coding ] ) , condition ( [ eq : df rate ] ) with @xmath42 , namely @xmath43 ensures that not only relay 1 but all relays can decode message @xmath23 ; and , generalizing , the inequality ( [ eq : df rate ] ) for a given @xmath39 guarantees that not only relay @xmath39 can decode message @xmath37 after having decoded @xmath44 , but also all relays @xmath45 can .",
    "the signal @xmath38 , and thus message @xmath26 is decoded by the destination only as it will be described in the next subsection .",

    "this step will be detailed below .",
    "we denote as @xmath48 the portion of the backhaul capacity devoted to the transmission of the messages decoded by relay @xmath9 .    beside the rate allocated to the transmission of ( part of ) the decoded messages",

    "the compression strategy at relay @xmath9 is characterized by the test channel @xmath50 according to conventional rate - distortion theory arguments ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . moreover , since the received signals at different relays are correlated with each other , it is beneficial to adopt a distributed source coding strategy . here ,",

    "thus , the decoder can successfully retrieve the descriptions @xmath54 if the conditions @xcite @xmath55 are satisfied for all @xmath16 , where we defined @xmath56 as the capacity allocated by relay @xmath9 to communicate the compressed received signal @xmath49 to the decoder .",
    "it is recalled that ( [ eq : backhaul constraint cf ] ) is the rate needed to compress @xmath57 as @xmath58 given that the destination has side information given by the previously decompressed signals @xmath59 .    without claim of optimality , we assume gaussian test channel @xmath50 , so that the compressed signal @xmath49 can be expressed as @xmath60 where the compression noise @xmath61 is independent of the received signal @xmath12 to be compressed .",
    "we observe that assumption of the gaussian test channels ( [ eq : gaussian test channel ] ) does not involve any loss of optimality if the relays are allowed to perform only the cf strategy @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "we remark that the compression strategy ( [ eq : gaussian test channel ] ) at relay @xmath9 is characterized by a single parameter @xmath62 .",
    "the destination decoder is assumed to first recover the descriptions @xmath54 from the signals received by the relays .",
    "this step is successful as long as conditions ( [ eq : backhaul constraint cf ] ) are satisfied .",

    "we observe here that the sufficiency of ( [ eq : backhaul df ] ) for correct decoding hinges on the fact that signal @xmath34 encodes messages @xmath35 for @xmath36 , and not merely @xmath37 as in the more conventional multi - layer approach @xcite@xcite .",

    "<S> in this work , a relay channel is studied in which a source encoder communicates with a destination decoder through a number of out - of - band relays that are connected to the decoder through capacity - constrained digital backhaul links . </S>",
    "<S> this model is motivated by the uplink of cloud radio access networks . in this scenario , a novel transmission and relaying strategies </S>",
    "<S> are proposed in which multi - layer transmission is used , on the one hand , to adaptively leverage the different decoding capabilities of the relays and , on the other hand , to enable hybrid decode - and - forward ( df ) and compress - and - forward ( cf ) relaying . </S>",
    "<S> the hybrid relaying strategy allows each relay to forward part of the decoded messages and a compressed version of the received signal to the decoder . </S>",
    "<S> the problem of optimizing the power allocation across the layers and the compression test channels is formulated . </S>",
    "<S> albeit non - convex , the derived problem is found to belong to the class of so called complementary geometric programs ( cgps ) . using this observation , an iterative algorithm based on the homotopy method </S>",
    "<S> is proposed that achieves a stationary point of the original problem by solving a sequence of geometric programming ( gp ) , and thus convex , problems . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results are provided that show the effectiveness of the proposed multi - layer hybrid scheme in achieving performance close to a theoretical ( cutset ) upper bound .    </S>",
