    "eclipsing binaries are a major source of fundamental astrophysical parameters of stars such as mass and radius .",
    "these parameters can help us better understand and constrain the overall picture of stellar evolution and its consequences , including but not limited to exoplanet host star parameters and studies of galactic and extragalactic star formation and abundance evolution .",
    "in a recent review , @xcite list 190 stars with mass and radius known to better than @xmath1% , only 26 ( or @xmath2% ) of which have a mass greater than 3 @xmath3 .",
    "this paucity of data for intermediate to high mass stars in binary systems is alarming .",
    "in particular , binary star evolution of systems of this type are one formation channel for type ia supernovae @xcite , one of the most studied phenomenon in determining cosmological parameters . in recent years",
    "large scale photometric surveys such as the all sky automated survey ( asas ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have preceded other surveys looking for transiting exoplanets .",
    "the byproduct of these searches will be a very large number of well sampled eclipsing binary light curves .",
    "the impetus behind this work is to find candidate intermediate and high mass binary systems with the future goal of obtaining fundamental parameters by observing these systems spectroscopically and resolving double lines",
    ". the applicability and validity of this technique has been demonstrated for lower mass systems in the recent effort by @xcite .",
    "we are starting a systematic observing program of newly identified or neglected intermediate mass eclipsing binaries .",
    "as an example of the kind of analyses we wish to pursue , we show here a case study of the binary system hi mon ( hd 51076 ) .",
    "this system s variability was first noted in @xcite .",
    "the system was classified as an `` ob '' type system in @xcite and has been listed as an early b - type system since @xcite , although no spectra for the system have been published .",
    "spectroscopic investigations of such binaries with hot components are a critical part of any parametric analysis since the photometric colors are similar for all hot stars and are influenced by interstellar reddening .    the extraction and selection of candidate massive eclipsing binary light curves is described in section 2 .",
    "this is followed in section 3 by a discussion of the analyses of these systems and estimation of uncertainties associated with computed values .",
    "section 4 discusses the methods and results of the combined light curve and spectroscopic analysis performed on hi mon .",
    "the sample selection criteria are based upon an ongoing spectroscopic observing program with the deveny spectrograph ( formerly the white spectrograph on the 2.1 m telescope at kitt peak national observatory ) on the 1.8 m perkins telescope at the anderson mesa station of lowell observatory .",
    "we searched the all sky automated survey catalog of variable stars @xcite which is a subset of the 3rd data release @xcite .",
    "the asas catalog of variable stars lists preliminary orbital periods for the identified eclipsing binaries . furthermore , pilecki , pojmaski , & szczygie  have prepared an on - line catalog that provides estimates of the system parameters based upon the @xmath4 and @xmath5-band light curves .",
    "we visually inspected several thousand individual light curves and extracted photometry for those systems that met our specific criteria .",
    "first , systems were selected that were typically north of @xmath6 with a few exceptions near this cutoff limit .",
    "the most southern object is hd 122026 at @xmath7 while the most northern object is dr vul with a declination of @xmath8 .",
    "the data releases so far from the asas have reached a northern limit of @xmath9 , a hard limit for the time being . in order to meet the exposure time limits for our spectral resolving power of @xmath10",
    ", we adopted a limiting @xmath4 magnitude of 11 .",
    "we then selected only light curves that had a primary eclipse depth greater than 0.1 mag to include only systems with well defined photometric variations .",
    "in addition , to ensure that the secondary spectral lines will be readily detected , we chose light curves where the ratio of eclipse depths was not extreme .",
    "we avoided contact systems and selected those with `` ea '' and `` eb '' light curves in the definition of @xcite because we want to study systems where the stars have yet to interact with each other and have evolved thus far as individual stars .    with this first cut of light curves , we then found the corresponding @xmath11,@xmath12,@xmath13 magnitudes from the 2mass catalog @xcite for each object . using the maximum brightness from the asas @xmath14band light curve and the 2mass @xmath15 magnitude , we computed @xmath16 colors for each candidate object . for many objects",
    "there is an unknown amount of interstellar reddening , which will cause the @xmath16 color to increase and indicate a star with a cooler spectral type .",
    "therefore , to look for intermediate mass binary candidates ( @xmath17 ) , we used table a5 in @xcite to eliminate later spectral types based on the apparent @xmath18 , corresponding to a spectral type earlier than f0 v. to add an additional constraint , we also computed the reddening - free @xmath19 parameter in the infrared from @xcite with the 2mass values .",
    "stars with @xmath20 usually correspond to main sequence stars with mass greater than 1.4 @xmath21 .",
    "observational parameters for candidate systems meeting all criteria are listed in table 1 .",
    "column 1 lists the asas identification tag in the asas catalog of variable stars . in column 2",
    "we list an alternate object name , typically found in the simbad database . following this ,",
    "columns 3 and 4 contain the right ascension and declination of the objects in the 2000.0 epoch as found from the simbad astronomical database .",
    "columns 5 and 6 list the @xmath16 and @xmath19 values as discussed above .",
    "next is column 7 , showing the spectral classification found in the literature for each object while column 8 lists the reference for each entry .",
    "column 7 demonstrates that most of the systems are intermediate mass binaries with an a- or b - type primary star .",
    "column 9 lists whether the system was known to be a binary before the asas catalog of variable stars and gives the reference to the work where the system was first discovered to be a binary .",
    "we wish to note that only 21 of our 56 candidates listed in table 1 are contained in the on - line atlas of pilecki , pojmaski , & szczygie .",
    "for each system , we fit the @xmath14band light curve using the eclipsing light curve ( elc ) code of @xcite .",
    "the program solves for orbital and physical parameters relevant to the light curve .",
    "these parameters include the epoch of mid - eclipse of the primary star @xmath22 , the orbital period @xmath23 , the orbital inclination @xmath24 , the roche lobe filling factor of each star , the temperature of each star , and the eccentricity and longitude of periastron of the primary @xmath25 in cases with elliptical orbits . in elc , the primary is defined as the more massive star . it should be noted that the sizes and temperatures of the stars are relative , and without spectroscopic analysis , we can not determine their true values .",
    "in finding a best fit light curve for each system , our solutions with elc create @xmath26 simulated light curves and record the @xmath27 statistic associated with each light curve .",
    "we project @xmath27 over the range of each parameter of interest and focus on the region around @xmath28 .",
    "the resulting @xmath27 curves are not symmetric about the minimum , so our final estimate for the uncertainty of any particular parameter was the larger of the two adjoining @xmath29 values .",
    "the best fit values are listed in table 2 , with uncertainties listed in parentheses in units of the last digit quoted .",
    "column 1 in table 2 lists the asas i d and column 2 gives the alternate i d . the orbital period for each system",
    "is given in column 3 .",
    "the period uncertainties are smaller in the shorter period systems due to the large number of orbits covered in the asas .",
    "similarly , column 4 is the epoch of mid - eclipse of the primary .",
    "note that this is different than the epoch of periastron for binaries with eccentric orbits .",
    "the asas catalog of variable stars also lists @xmath23 and @xmath22 .",
    "our orbital periods do not differ greatly , but our reference epochs were chosen to be more recent than those listed in @xcite , reflecting times closer to when spectroscopic observations may be taken .",
    "next is the orbital inclination in column 5 , followed by the eccentricity of the orbit in column 6 , and the longitude of periastron in column 7 , where applicable .",
    "the value of the eccentricity found for bd+11 3569 of @xmath30 is only 3@xmath31 different than zero .",
    "we therefore estimate that given the typical uncertainty in the asas data , any system listed with @xmath32 probably has an eccentricity no greater than 0.01 .",
    "it should also be noted that the longitude of periastron given here follows the spectroscopic orbit definition , i.e. , measured from the plane of the sky through the center of mass to the primary .    to check the accuracy of our results",
    ", we can compare our values listed in table 2 with those previously published .",
    "for example , a detailed light curve study of yy sgr was made by @xcite .",
    "his fit gives a longitude of periastron of 214.52 @xmath33 0.46 deg , matching with our value of 214.1 @xmath33 0.5 deg within uncertainties .",
    "the eccentricity in lacy s work of 0.1573 @xmath33 0.0008 and the inclination of 88.89 @xmath33 0.12 deg are close to our derived values of 0.117 @xmath33 0.001 and 88.1 @xmath33 0.1 deg , respectively , but still differ by more than 3@xmath31 .",
    "this is most likely due to the differences in the data analyzed .",
    "the data set in @xcite consists of 717 measures most of which were made during eclipses where the above parameters are best constrained .",
    "our data set includes 601 measures more or less evenly distributed around the orbit , and thus eclipses are not as well measured and our resulting parameters are not as accurate nor as well constrained .",
    "future observations , specifically targeted to get data during eclipses , will help resolve these differences .",
    "one of our goals in selecting the candidates in tables 1 and 2 is to collect a set of data for early - type eclipsing binaries .",
    "using previously published spectral classifications we construct a histogram of the number of objects as a function of spectral type in figure 1 .",
    "this plot may be somewhat biased , as several spectral types are from @xcite .",
    "subtle differences in the he i 4471    line are the determinant for discerning late - b from early - a spectral types .",
    "early photographic plate spectra may not have been sufficiently sensitive to the changes in this temperature region , and we suspect several systems are consequently lumped into the `` a0 '' category .",
    "regardless , this plot shows that for the objects with published spectra , we have met our goal of finding systems earlier than f0 .",
    "in fact , we have more stars ( 30 ) hotter than a0 than stars ( 17 ) cooler than a0 .",
    "note that hd 60389 , with a spectral type estimate of g6 v does not appear in this figure .",
    "note also that not all systems discussed here have spectral types , and some previously known systems have spectral type estimates for both stars plotted in the histogram .",
    "light curve solutions for the full sample are given in the appendix .",
    "spectra for hi mon were obtained at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) 4-m blanco telescope between 2009 dec 23 and 2009 dec 27 .",
    "the rc - spectrograph was used with the g380 ( 1200 grooves mm@xmath34 ) grating in second order and blue collimator giving wavelength coverage from 3932 to 4750   with a three pixel resolution of @xmath35 . exposure times ranged from 150 to 180 s in order to obtain a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) @xmath36  pixel@xmath34 .",
    "helium - neon - argon comparison lamp spectra were obtained before and after each target observation , and bias and flat - field spectra were obtained nightly .",
    "the spectra were extracted and calibrated using standard routines in iraf .",
    "each continuum - rectified spectrum was then transformed to a common heliocentric wavelength grid in log @xmath37 increments .    to compute important astrophysical parameters for individual stars in double - lined spectroscopic binaries that are also eclipsing ,",
    "spectra need to be obtained near quadrature points ( times of maximum velocity separation ) .",
    "this will allow for the estimation of velocity semiamplitudes for each star in the system , and leads directly to an estimate of the mass ratio . to observe the binary system in such a configuration",
    ", one needs to observe the system at very specific times in its orbit .",
    "therefore , an accurate ephemeris from the more easily obtained photometric light curve data is desirable . using this ephemeris for hi mon as computed above , we observed the system near quadrature phases in order to test both the accuracy of our ephemerides and to test whether this approach can yield accurate ( @xmath38 uncertain ) astrophysical parameters for stars .",
    "two such observations near quadrature points ( orbital phase 0.31 and 0.75 ) are shown in figure 2 along with identified spectral features .",
    "radial velocities were measured using four spectral lines , @xmath374026 , h@xmath39 @xmath374101 , @xmath374143 , and h@xmath40 @xmath374340 .",
    "a template - fitting scheme @xcite was used that measures velocities by using model spectra weighted by a flux ratio to match both the shifts and line depths in the observed spectra .",
    "we found no evidence for emission or intrinsic line asymmetries in any spectral feature .",
    "the bstar2006 grid of stellar models from @xcite was used to derive template spectra .",
    "these models are based on the line - blanketed , non local thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) , plane - parallel , hydrostatic atmosphere code tlusty and the radiative transfer code synspec @xcite .",
    "the process of finding templates began by making initial estimates for temperatures , gravities , projected rotational velocities , and relative flux contributions from each star .",
    "parameters for model templates were then checked against spectral features in the tomographically reconstructed spectra of each star ( section 4.2 ) .",
    "the parameters were changed and new templates made after initial fits to the light and radial velocity curves ( section 4.3 ) indicated that slightly different values were more appropriate . the velocity analysis was performed again until the best fit was obtained .",
    "based on the relative line depths of spectral components , we were able to obtain an observational monochromatic flux ratio in the blue of @xmath41 .",
    "the four values for velocity from each spectrum for each component were averaged , and the standard deviation of the mean was calculated . each of these values are listed in table 3 , along with the observation date , orbital phase , and observed minus calculated values .",
    "we used the doppler tomography algorithm of @xcite to separate the primary and secondary spectra of hi  mon .",
    "this iterative method uses the eight observed composite spectra from outside eclipse phases , their observed velocity shifts , and an assumed monochromatic flux ratio to derive individual component spectra .",
    "the best flux ratio was the one that best matched the line depths in the reconstructions with those in the model spectra .",
    "figure 3 shows the reconstructed spectra for the primary and secondary , along with the best fit model spectra for each .",
    "the region containing the diffuse interstellar absorption band around @xmath374428  , and other interstellar features were removed when performing the reconstruction , as otherwise this introduced noise into the final reconstructed spectra .",
    "of particular importance are the fits of the wings of the h@xmath40 @xmath374340 line , as these are produced by linear stark broadening and are good estimators for the gravities of the stars .",
    "the relative depths of the @xmath374471 and @xmath374481 lines give an indication of the temperature in early b - type stars . note that fast rotation can lead to changing depths of these features , but these stars are not seen to be rotating quickly .",
    "the final reconstructed spectra were fitted with tlusty / synspec model synthesis spectra ( see section 4.1 ) .",
    "estimates listed in table 4 were made by comparing the reconstructed and model spectral line profiles against a grid of test values ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "spectral type estimates were obtained by comparing the effective temperature against table 2 of @xcite and table 3 of @xcite .",
    "the gravities of each star indicate they are main sequence objects , so final estimates for the spectral classifications are b0 v and b0.5 v.      elc was used to fit both the light curve and the radial velocity curves simultaneously .",
    "the parameters allowed to vary included the orbital period , epoch of primary eclipse , @xmath42 , inclination , mass ratio , primary velocity semiamplitude , effective temperatures of each star , and roche lobe filling factor for each star .",
    "the roche lobe filling factor is defined by @xcite as the ratio of the radius of the star toward the inner lagrangian point ( @xmath43 ) to the distance to @xmath43 from the center of the star , @xmath44 .",
    "nonzero eccentricities for hi  mon were explored during initial fitting , but rejected based on the higher @xmath45 values for those fits .",
    "hi  mon is therefore a `` false member '' of candidate eccentric systems listed in @xcite .",
    "the resulting best fit velocity curves are shown in figure 4 and the best fit light curve is shown in figure 5 . during eclipses ( at phase 0.0 and 0.5 in both figures 4 and 5 ) , bumps in the radial velocity curve can be seen due to the rotational doppler shifts of the unobscured portions of the eclipsed star .",
    "this changes the shape of the observed spectral features , and gives rise to the velocity change , a perturbation known as the rossiter - mclaughlin effect .    to estimate uncertainties based on our best fit",
    ", we used the nearly 40,000 recorded @xmath45 values for each fit to the light and radial velocity curves performed by elc .",
    "we projected the well explored @xmath45 surface onto each parameter of interest .",
    "the lowest @xmath45 value is found for each parameter and the 1-@xmath31 uncertainty estimated from the region where @xmath46 .",
    "these values are listed in table 5 for the circular orbital solution .",
    "astrophysical parameters of interest are listed in table 6 .",
    "comparing our results with those from the on - line catalog of pilecki , pojmaski , & szczygie  reveals a few differences .",
    "our inclination of 80.0 @xmath33 0.2 agrees well with their inclination of 80.9 . also matching reasonably well are our temperature ratios , 0.963 from our best fit , and 0.971 in their catalog .",
    "their estimations for polar radius of each star relative to its roche lobe polar radius are 0.793 and 0.830 for the primary and secondary , respectively .",
    "these values are systematically larger than the values we derive from our best elc fit , most likely due to the additional constraints from the spectra .",
    "the most discrepant set of values are for the temperatures of the individual stars .",
    "they list 8110 k for the primary and 7870 k for the secondary .",
    "they arrive at the value for the primary based on the @xmath47 color index .",
    "there are several problems with estimating the temperature of intermediate mass stars with only a color index .",
    "first , interstellar extinction has not been taken into account .",
    "distances for mid to early b - type stars of the magnitude ranges covered in the asas ( @xmath487 - 12 ) are going to be in excess of one kpc .",
    "since these intermediate mass stars are typically found in or near the galactic plane , where extinction is more pronounced , any estimation of the temperature based on photometry will be effected by an unknown amount .",
    "also , because the temperatures of intermediate mass binaries are high , their photometric colors sample the rayleigh - jeans tail of the energy distribution and the color differences are small . for example , the difference in @xmath47 is only 0.05 mag between a 20 kk star and a 25 kk star @xcite .",
    "both of these factors illustrate the need for spectroscopy to understand the nature of these intermediate mass binaries .      with a modest number of spectra ( 11 total )",
    ", we have determined the masses and radii of each component in hi  mon to better than 3@xmath49 accuracy , as is seen in table 6 .",
    "both stars are within their roche lobes but experience tidal distortion , as evidenced in the light curve in figure 5 .",
    "tidal evolution in the hi  mon system is also seen in the fact that the projected rotational velocities from the tomographic reconstructions ( table 4 ) and from the synchronous rates from elc ( table 6 ) are consistent within uncertainties .",
    "this indicates that the system has had sufficient time to undergo tidal evolution in order to attain synchronous rotation .    to make a more quantitative estimate of the age of the system",
    ", we used the effective temperatures and effective radii of each component from table 6 and plotted the two stars of hi  mon on a theoretical hertzsprung - russell ( h - r ) diagram to compare their locations with evolutionary tracks .",
    "since the stars are tidally distorted , the effective radius of each star is the radius of a sphere with the same volume .",
    "figure 6 shows evolutionary tracks from @xcite for stars of 12 and 15 @xmath21 and isochrones from @xcite for solar metallicity for ages of 1.5 , 2.5 , and 3.5 myr .",
    "the ages of the stars are most consistent with an age of 2.5 myr .",
    "the evolutionary tracks from @xcite are for nonrotating stellar models .",
    "the ratios of spin angular velocity to critical angular velocity are @xmath50 0.42 for the primary and 0.43 for the secondary .",
    "the evolutionary tracks for these moderate rotation rates are only slightly steeper and more extended in time than those illustrated @xcite .",
    "thus , our derived age is a lower limit .",
    "we can also estimate the distance to the system by fitting a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) to photometric measurements from the literature ( since our spectra were not flux calibrated ) .",
    "we used measurements from @xcite for @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath4 values , noting that the @xmath4-band measurement of maximum light from the asas light curve is consistent with these measures , meaning they were likely not taken during eclipse .",
    "in addition , we used 2mass @xcite measurements to constrain the near - ir part of the sed .",
    "strmgren photometric system measurements reported by @xcite were not consistent with the other photometry and were not used in the calculation of the sed .",
    "the sed fit is shown in figure 7 with the @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath4 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 magnitudes transformed to fluxes using the calibrations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "model spectra for each star from @xcite with parameters for our best fit from elc ( table 6 ) were scaled in the blue by the flux ratio ( also table 6 ) of 0.81 @xmath33 0.09 and added to form the total sed of the system .",
    "this fit of the sed results in a limb - darkened angular diameter for the primary of @xmath53 @xmath54as and a reddening of @xmath55 mag and a ratio of total - to - selective extinction of @xmath56 .",
    "this reddening value matches reasonably well with the values in the literature of 0.30 @xcite and 0.38 @xcite . combining this angular diameter with the physical radius for the primary from table 6 , we estimate the distance to hi  mon to be 2.26 @xmath33 0.04 kpc . by contrast , this value is not consistent with previous photometric distance estimates for hi  mon of 3.89 kpc @xcite and 3.98 kpc @xcite .",
    "hi  mon has galactic coordinates of @xmath57 and @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the closest galactic cluster is ngc 2311 that is located at @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "@xcite find a distance to the cluster of 2.2 @xmath33 0.4 kpc and a reddening of @xmath61 .",
    "however , they find an age for the cluster of @xmath0100 myr , making hi  mon far too young to be associated with ngc 2311 .",
    "the distance we find for hi  mon and its location suggest it is part of `` group a '' as defined by @xcite .",
    "this group is an association of luminous stars in the constellation of monoceros at a distance of about 2.2 kpc that is part of the local arm of the galaxy .",
    "this material is based on work supported by the national science foundation under grants ast@xmath620606861 and ast@xmath621009080 .",
    "this publication makes use of data products from the two micron all sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center / california institute of technology , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .",

    "figures of the light curves and fits for each of these systems are included in the on - line material as figure set a. these plots contain the asas data with uncertainties , phased to our derived orbits listed in table 2 .",
    "these best fit orbits are shown by green lines passing through the data between orbital phases @xmath63 to 1.2 to show the primary eclipse in its entirety .",
    "there are several systems that have interesting features in their light curves .",
    "for example , figure 26 shows the light curve for nsv 3433 .",
    "it shows one of the larger temperature differences between components in this sample .",
    "it also shows an illumination effect on the secondary by the flux of the hotter primary .",
    "the out - of - eclipse flux is higher just before and after the secondary eclipse , indicating that the side of the secondary facing the primary is slightly hotter and giving off more light at this orbital phase .",
    "figure 36 illustrates the light curve of hd 63818 .",
    "this system has a moderately high eccentricity ( 0.132 ) with @xmath64 , meaning the periastron of the orbit is close to the plane of the sky .",
    "this causes the secondary eclipse to be shifted from the circular case where it would be at 0.5 in orbital phase .",
    "a particularly illustrative example of this is tyc 1025 - 1524 - 1 seen in figure 57 .",
    "the widths of the eclipses are different owing to an eccentricity of 0.367 .",
    "periastron occurs near phase 0.02 ( @xmath65 ) , and the deeper , narrow eclipse at phase 0.0 results from the rapid and close passage of the secondary star in front of the primary star .",
    "several systems have very well constrained light curves such as hd 48866 in figure 16 and tt pyx seen in figure 40 that will make for highly accurate determinations of mass and radius when combined with double - lined spectroscopic orbits , and therefore , they represent the jewels of the collection .",
