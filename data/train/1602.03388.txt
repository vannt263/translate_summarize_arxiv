    "a biological cell is a marvel of natural engineering . within its cytoplasm",
    ", proteins collectively self - organize into dynamical assemblies which enable the cell to crawl or swim , replicate , and self - heal . in comparison , traditional human - engineered materials",
    "have remarkably limited functionality , since they are constrained by the laws of thermodynamics which forbid emergence of spontaneous motion or macroscopic work .",
    "the cell is freed from the rigid constraints of equilibrium because its biomolecules are ` active ' , converting energy into motion at the microscale , to maintain the cell out of equilibrium .",
    "the paradigm of _ active matter _ encompasses materials whose constituent elements , like the components of a cell , consume energy to generate forces and motion .",
    "the most plentiful source of active materials is biology itself , where active matter is found on scales ranging from the cell cytoskeleton to swarming bacterial colonies and flocking animals .",
    "further , it is now possible to construct artificial ` active materials ' from biomolecules or synthetic colloids which have a similar capability to convert energy into motion .",
    "these systems are poised to transform materials science , creating self - organizing materials capable of autonomous motion or adapting to their environments , thus mimicking the capabilities of living organisms .",
    "however , there is currently no predictive theory that enables designing components to self - organize into particular structures or perform particular functions .",
    "thus , a key goal of active matter is to develop such a theoretical framework , by starting from controllable experimental model systems and minimal computational models , and identifying relevant symmetry principles and conservation laws . in this review",
    ", we summarize recent progress toward this goal , arising from two recently developed model systems .    a reasonable starting point to classify active matter systems",
    "is based on two symmetries  one associated with how particles align with each other , and another associated with how activity enters the system .",
    "the first is familiar from equilibrium materials .",
    "particles with isotropic interactions ( _ e.g._spherical colloids ) form isotropic fluids at moderate densities , whereas elongated particles align to form orientationally ordered liquid crystals ( such as nematic liquid crystals used in displays ) .",
    "in contrast , the symmetry of the activity only applies to nonequilibrium , active systems .",
    "for example , a bird flying in the direction of its head undergoes directed motion and has polar activity , whereas a bacterium growing from both ends has nematic activity . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ [ fig : symmetries ] ] , these symmetries can be combined in different ways to generate different classes of behaviors .    motivated by flocks of animals , the first- and most - studied symmetry class is polar alignment and polar activity , or particles that align in the same direction as their neighbors and undergo head - directed motion , generating polar flocks .",
    "early theoretical work showed that hydrodynamic symmetry - based models can describe the macroscopic behaviors of such flocks , and demonstrated that active matter systems can exhibit behaviors not possible in equilibrium systems , such as long - range order in 2d @xcite .",
    "more recently , experimentalists have created active matter systems with other kinds of symmetries , leading to qualitatively new kinds of behaviors . in this review , we focus on two of these systems , where at first glance we might not expect coherent emergent behaviors : particles with polar activity but no interparticle alignment , and particles that align but experience nematic activity . in each case",
    ", we summarize experiments and modeling that discovered new ordered phases , and we identify the physics underlying these phases .    [ hbt ]    [ hbt ]",
    "we begin with the simplest model system in materials physics , hard sphere colloids .",
    "these are spherical , micron - sized particles with purely repulsive interactions arising from excluded volume .",
    "the particles can be suspended in a fluid ( 3d ) or sedimented at an interface ( 2d ) , and they form an isotropic gas at most densities . the active analog of a hard sphere is a ` self - propelled ' colloid that undergoes propulsion along a particular body axis . the closest experimental realization is a spherical particle that is asymmetrically coated with a catalyst ( _ e.g._platinum ) and placed in solvent with a fuel ( _ e.g._hydrogen peroxide ) .",
    "the on - board catalysis generates asymmetric concentrations of products , driving particle motion in a direction determined by its orientation @xcite .",
    "further , this orientation fluctuates due to thermal and athermal effects from the medium and hence undergoes rotational diffusion , thereby making the self - propelled colloid perform a persistent random walk .",
    "such a motion is characterized by a _ persistence length _ ( the average distance traveled by a particle before reorienting ) , which is set by the ratio of the self - propulsion velocity to the rotational diffusion constant .",
    "there have been numerous modeling and experimental studies of this minimal model system over the past five years , recently reviewed in @xcite .",
    "here we present a pedagogical overview of these results .",
    "although this material is composed of non - aligning particles with _ no attractive interactions _ , simulations showed that self - propelled colloids in 2d @xcite and 3d @xcite phase separate into dense macroscopic clusters and a dilute phase ( fig .  [ fig : activespheres]a - c ) .",
    "similar behavior was observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "the phase separation has all the hallmarks of equilibrium vapor - liquid phase coexistence . in equilibrium thermodynamics , the phase diagram of a vapor - liquid system as a function of density and temperature",
    "is described by the following terms : _",
    "i ) _ a _ binodal _ , which envelopes the region in paramater space where phase separation occurs ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : activespheres]b ) ; _ ii ) _ a _ spinodal _ , which demarcates a region within the binodal where phase separation proceeds without a nucleation barrier , with clusters arising spontaneously throughout the fluid and then undergoing power - law coarsening ; and _ iii ) _ a _ critical point _ where the binodal and spinodal meet , at which density fluctuations become macroscopic in size .",
    "active colloids exhibit all of these features @xcite .",
    "however , the usual role played by temperature in a gas - liquid system is now played by the inverse of the persistence length .    phase separation driven by particle self - propulsion is referred to as motility - induced phase separation ( mips ) .",
    "tailleur and cates @xcite showed that particles whose propulsion velocity is a decreasing function of local particle density , _",
    "e.g._due to interparticle collisions , are generically unstable to phase separation .",
    "the decreasing velocity leads to local particle accumulation , and hence further velocity reduction , generating a positive feedback loop .",
    "redner et al.@xcite showed that the phase behavior of active colloids in 2d could be described by considering the fluxes of particles into / out of a macroscopic cluster ( fig .",
    "[ fig : activespheres ] d ) the crucial observation is that a particle encountering a cluster surface is trapped by excluded volume interactions until its direction reorients away from the cluster . since the inward flux of such particles is proportional to the density in the dilute phase , there is a threshold density above which the cluster phase will grow .",
    "both approaches show that the persistence of particle propulsion directions leads to _ self - trapping _ , meaning a suppression of particle motions due to long - lived contacts between colliding particles . in summary , self - propulsion acts as an effective ( albeit transient ) interparticle attraction , driving emergent phenomena that passive hard spheres could never achieve .    while the gross bulk properties of self - propelled colloids are captured by the paradigm of gas - liquid phase separation ,",
    "there are several surprising and unique properties :    \\1 .",
    "the dense phase exhibits an unusual combination of structure and dynamics .",
    "when the particles are monodisperse , it exhibits the structural signatures of a liquid , hexatic , or crystal as the propulsion velocity increases , while polydisperse particles form active glasses @xcite . yet , even when the structure indicates a crystalline phase , the constituent particles are highly mobile , exhibiting diffusive behavior on long timescales @xcite , more typical of a liquid .",
    "moreover , mixtures of self - propelled and passive ( brownian ) particles tend to segregate , with the active particles driving crystallization of their passive neighbors @xcite . additionally , while macrophase separation implies that active colloidal fluids have an effective surface tension , cluster boundaries exhibit large fluctuations which were found to be consistent with negative surface tension balanced by interfacial stiffness@xcite .    \\2 .",
    "since self - propulsion acts as an effective attraction between repulsive colloids , one might expect that it would universally enhance coagulation of particles with attractive energetic interactions .",
    "however , self - propelled particles endowed with energetic interparticle attractions have a _ reentrant _ phase diagram @xcite ; _ i.e. _ , starting with an equilibrium system that is phase separated due to attractions , monotonically increasing self - propulsion first melts the system into a homogeneous fluid , and then returns it to a phase separated state .",
    "extension of the model in fig .",
    "[ fig : activespheres]d describes this effect  moderate propulsion strengths tend to break apart attraction - stabilized interactions , while strong propulsion leads to clustering via the self - trapping mechanism described above @xcite .",
    "importantly , the behavior at low propulsion strengths shows that the nonequilibrium properties of this system can not simply be mapped onto an equilibrium system of particles with energetic attractions .    \\3 .",
    "a pillar of materials theory is extensivity , which implies that boundary effects are local and studies of an isolated bulk system can be applied to real systems that are necessarily confined by boundaries .",
    "however , in active materials the effects of boundaries are profound and far reaching . for example",
    ", self - propelled colloids tend to accumulate at boundaries @xcite , and are concentrated in regions of high curvature @xcite . in another example , ratchets and funnels drive spontaneous flow in active fluids  @xcite .",
    "this effect has been used to direct bacterial motion  @xcite and harness bacterial power to propel microscopic gears  @xcite .",
    "we now consider active nematics , which consist of elongated particles whose activity enters with nematic ( head - tail ) symmetry .",
    "biological active nematics include confluent monolayers of fibroblast cells @xcite and growing cells that elongate over time @xcite .",
    "the first synthetic active nematic system considered was that of a vibrated monolayer of granular rods @xcite .",
    "subsequently a robust , _ in vitro _",
    "biomaterial system composed of length - stabilized microtubules driven by motor protein clusters has served as a prototype active nematic @xcite .",
    "synthetic and biological materials have also been combined , for example bacteria swimming in a lyotropic liquid crystal @xcite .",
    "there is a vast theoretical literature on active nematics ( recently reviewed in @xcite ) , beginning with seminal papers by ramaswamy and collaborators @xcite .",
    "diverse phenomenology have been uncovered and understood , including phase separation into unstable bands @xcite , convection rolls and oscillatory patterns @xcite , spontaneous flow transitions due to confinement @xcite , and anomalous rheological properties @xcite . here",
    ", we focus on the macroscale dynamics of dense 2d extensile systems ( the particles push outward along their body axis ) , which is governed by topological defects .    the primary descriptor of a nematic fluid is the director field , which characterizes the local orientation of the constituent particles at any point in the fluid .",
    "a topological defect is a compact distortion of the director field that arises where domains of differently oriented nematic regions meet .",
    "defects are characterized by a topological charge , which measures how much the director rotates around the defect . in nematics ,",
    "the most common ( and lowest charge ) defects are @xmath0 and @xmath1 defects associated with the director field rotating by @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : activenematics ] ) . in a passive nematic ,",
    "defects are primarily generated during sample preparation , and are static .",
    "nearby defects with opposite charge annihilate , lowering the elastic energy to approach the equilibrium state  a uniformly aligned state with ( quasi)-long - range orientational order .",
    "the behavior of defects in active nematics is dramatically different .",
    "after sample preparation , defects continue to arise spontaneously until the system reaches a nonequilibrium steady - state with a finite defect density , with equal rates of defect generation and annihilation .",
    "further , each @xmath0 defect moves along the direction of its ` head ' as if self - propelled ( fig .",
    "[ [ fig : activenematics ] ] ) . powered by these motions",
    ", active nematics can exhibit large - scale turbulent flows , despite being in the low reynolds number limit @xcite , where turbulent flows typically do not occur because the fluid viscosity damps out inertial motions .",
    "in contrast to high reynolds number turbulence , these flows exhibit an ` inverse energy cascade ' , where energy injected at the particle scale generates large - scale flows .",
    "these chaotic dynamics appear to destroy the ( quasi)-long - range order characteristic of an equilibrium nematic .",
    "remarkably , experiments on microtubule - based active nematics and simulations of extensile rods demonstrated that the defects themselves can acquire system - spanning orientational order @xcite .",
    "defect - ordered phases were subsequently found in several theoretical models for active nematics @xcite , suggesting they are a generic feature of active nematics .",
    "in contrast to equilibrium ordered phases of static topological defects ( _ e.g._twist grain boundaries in liquid crystals and flux line lattices in type ii superconductors ) , the ordered defects in active nematics are motile and transient , continually undergoing annihilation and rebirth .",
    "the mechanism of spontaneous defect generation and propulsion of the @xmath0 defects can be understood as follows ( fig .",
    "[ fig : activenematics]d ) .",
    "extensile filaments exert forces along their long axis in both directions .",
    "these forces balance when the nematic is perfectly flat .",
    "however , a small fluctuation in local orientational order causes a net force orthogonal to the direction of mean order , driving growth of the fluctuation and eventual nucleation of a @xmath3 defect pair from the flat nematic background .",
    "further , the distortion of the orientation field at a @xmath0 defect generates a net force along its axis , which propels the defect along its ` head ' .",
    "a number of computational and theoretical models have been developed , applicable to different experimental realizations of active nematics .",
    "these can be roughly categorized by whether they consider long - range fluid - mediated interactions ( @xcite ) , or assume that fluid - mediated interactions are absent ( such as vibrated rods or cell sheets ) or screened at large scales due to confinement in 2d @xcite .",
    "while all of these models capture spontaneous creation and self - propulsion of defects , interactions between defects are model - dependent , and which models most closely describe existing experimental systems requires further investigation",
    ".    * outlook . *",
    "the examples described above suggest that the symmetries of particle interactions and activity generation are a useful starting point for classifying the possible emergent behaviors in an active system .",
    "while inspiration and materials from biological systems were used to create new materials in these examples , researchers are also beginning to apply the physical understanding and theoretical frameworks developed for these materials to biology .",
    "for example , pattern formation in bacterial colonies has been described as motility - induced phase separation @xcite that is arrested by the logistic growth of the bacteria , and the mitotic spindle in a zenopus egg extract has been quantitatively modeled as an active nematic fluid @xcite .",
    "thus , the paradigm of active matter has the potential to achieve biology - inspired advances in materials physics , while in turn shedding new light on the emergence of function in biological systems .",
