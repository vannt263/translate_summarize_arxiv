    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are close binary star systems comprised of a white dwarf ( the primary ) that accretes matter from a less compact companion star ( the secondary ) in roche lobe overflow .",
    "there exist many types of cvs , providing unique laboratories in which to study various aspects of astrophysics .",
    "@xcite gives an overview of the field .",
    "the most fundamental characteristic of a cv is the period of its orbit , @xmath0 .",
    "when an eclipse is evident , the period is incontrovertible . in non - eclipsing cvs",
    ", the period may be found using radial velocities .",
    "often , a spectral contribution from the secondary star is present .",
    "this provides useful clues to the distance and the evolutionary state of the system .    in the current study , we discuss four cvs : gy hya , sdss j204448 - 045929 , v392 hya , and rxj1951.7 + 3716 .",
    "none of them have extensive spectroscopic studies in the literature .",
    "we report their basic properties ( period , spectral type of secondary ) and infer distances .",
    "all four stars have periods above 7 hours , the longest period being that of sdss j204448 - 045929 , @xmath1 d. as stated in @xcite ( hereafter tft04 ) , longer - period systems provide information on cv evolution ; in particular , many systems appear to have begun nuclear evolution prior to mass transfer @xcite .",
    "tft04 provide a background in long - period cv analysis .",
    "section 2 describes the observations and analysis , and  3 gives results . in  4 ,",
    "we provide a brief discussion .",
    "table  [ tab : journal ] lists the observations , all of which were taken with the 2.4-meter hiltner telescope at mdm observatory in kitt peak , arizona .",
    "we used the ` modular ' spectrograph , a 600 line mm@xmath2 grating , a 1-arcsec slit , and a site 2048@xmath3 ccd detector yielding 2   pixel@xmath2 from 4210 to 7560   ( vignetting severely toward the ends ) , and typical resolution of 3.5   fwhm . on most observing runs ,",
    "spectra of comparison lamps were taken whenever the telescope was moved to achieve accurate wavelength calibration . on some observing runs , comparison lamp spectra were not taken during the night , and the wavelength solution derived from lamps was shifted by an amount determined from the night - sky lines . for a detailed discussion of calibration procedures , see tft04 .",
    "our main objective was to find orbital periods . to this end , we measured radial velocities in the spectra using both absorption and emission lines , when possible .",
    "the absorption lines originate in the atmosphere of the secondary star .",
    "absorption line velocities were found using the iraf cross - correlation radial velocity package _ xcsao _ @xcite .",
    "the routine was run on the wavelength range 6000 to 6500  .",
    "uncertainties , based on the @xmath4-statistic of @xcite , are typically less than 10 km s@xmath2 . for a handful of low signal - to - noise exposures ,",
    "the cross - correlations were not formally significant , leading to unphysical velocities which were excluded from further analyses .",
    "emission line velocities were found by measuring the shift of h@xmath5 via the convolution technique of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this method consists of convolving two antisymmetric gaussians with the emission line , with an adjustable separation parameter , @xmath5 , and searching for the zero of the convolution .",
    "typical values of @xmath5 are 12 - 15  .",
    "the idea ( valid or not ) is that the two gaussians measure the wings of the line , which may arise in a symmetrical portion of the accretion - disk emission close to the white dwarf .",
    "the best parameters for the convolution function are found by searching for the largest value of @xmath5 which yields reliable results .",
    "this was done for all stars , regardless of line profile ( single- or double - peaked ) .",
    "we ran a period - search algorithm which fit general least - squares sinusoids of the form @xmath6 to the time series with a range of equally - spaced frequencies , @xmath7 .",
    "ideally , a periodogram of 1/@xmath8 versus frequency shows a lone peak corresponding to the true frequency . due to the uneven sampling of the time - series , alias ( false ) periods often appear in the periodogram .",
    "we used a monte carlo algorithm developed by @xcite to assess confidence with which the highest peak in the periodogram can be identified with the true orbital frequency .",
    "once the optimal period was found , we fit the time - series with sinusoids of the form @xmath9\\ ] ] using a hybrid linear least - square algorithm .",
    "this procedure is described in detail in tft04 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : folpl ] , radial velocity curves are shown , folded twice for continuity . when both absorption and emission line velocities are available , the radial velocity curves are folded using the weighted mean period .",
    "the parameters for the least - squares best - fit curves are given in table  [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "the absorption and emission line curves are very close to being @xmath10 cycle out - of - phase .",
    "if the curves are consistent with @xmath11 , the mass ratio of the secondary to the primary may be estimated to be @xmath12 .",
    "we caution the reader that the measured @xmath13 values may misrepresent the orbital motion of the components , especially @xmath14 which originates from the accretion disk . having the emission and absorption velocities",
    "@xmath10 cycle out - of - phase is a necessary , but not sufficient condition for the @xmath14 to represent the motion of the white dwarf .      for spectral decomposition",
    ", we prepared an average spectrum for each system in which the individual exposures were shifted to the absorption line rest frame .",
    "we have a collection of standard k- and m - star obtained with the same instrumental setup as the present data .",
    "these k and m stars were classified by @xcite and @xcite , respectively . the library of template spectra were scaled and subsequently subtracted from the averaged spectra in order to eliminate the absorption lines due to the secondary .",
    "we did not rotationally - broaden our template spectra prior to subtraction because the rotational broadening expected for the secondary stars is small compared to our spectral resolution .",
    "we examined the residual spectra by eye . in an ideal case ,",
    "the absorption lines would disappear entirely , leaving only the continuum and emission lines , but in reality the subtractions were never perfect .",
    "nonetheless , the subtractions were fairly good .",
    "in all the cases considered here , the spectral type of the secondary could be estimated to @xmath15 subclass , and the secondary s contribution to the flux could be estimated to @xmath16 .    using the known periods and spectral types , inferences about the systems",
    "have been made based on physical considerations and empirical relations .",
    "we assumed that the secondaries fill their roche lobes , and are undergoing mass transfer .",
    "note carefully that we _ did not _",
    "assume that the secondaries follow a main - sequence spectral type versus absolute magnitude ( sp-@xmath17 ) relationship .",
    "instead , we used a relationship between the surface brightness and the spectral type for normal stars derived by @xcite . to convert the surface brightness to @xmath17 ,",
    "we of course need a secondary - star radius @xmath18 .",
    "this is strongly constrained by the roche geometry and the orbital period . to estimate @xmath18 we begin with an analytical approximation to the roche lobe radius , given by @xcite , which shows that",
    ", at a given @xmath0 , @xmath18 is almost independent of the primary star mass @xmath19 , and is dependent only on the cube root of @xmath20 .",
    "we have no direct measure of @xmath20 , but we can estimate a range of plausible values using the evolutionary scenarios of @xcite as a guideline , at least for systems with @xmath21 h. armed with our estimate of the secondary s radius , we transformed the surface brightness to @xmath17 .",
    "the synthetic apparent magnitude of the secondary , @xmath22 , was found from the scaled template spectra used during spectral decomposition using the iraf task _ sbands _ and the @xcite tabulation of the @xmath23 passband .",
    "finally , visual extinction values , @xmath24 , were estimated from infrared dust maps of @xcite , and @xmath24 , @xmath22 , and @xmath17 were combined to yield a distance .",
    "the dust extinction estimate is imperfect , because ( a ) the ism can be patchy on scales smaller than the 6-arcmin resolution of the maps , and ( b ) the maps give estimates of the total extinction to the edge of the galaxy , rather than to the star of interest .",
    "however , for three of the four objects studied here , the galactic latitudes are high enough that the uncertain extinction should have a fairly minor effect on the distance .",

    "our spectroscopic observations span a baseline of 111 days . our spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : subspec ] ) shows weaker emission features and strong absorption lines , indicating a significant contribution from the secondary .",
    "the absorption line velocities have large amplitude ( @xmath26 @xmath27 km s@xmath2 ) and small scatter about a best - fit sinusoid of period , @xmath28 d , or 500 min .",

    "time - series photometry from @xcite shows an eclipse with a period of @xmath31 d ; our period is consistent with this .",
    "the emission lines were weak , thus a reliable fit to the h@xmath5 emission line velocities was not found and not included in fig .  [ fig : folpl ] .",
    "spectral decomposition of our flux - averaged spectrum shows a secondary of type k4 or k5 .",
    "the synthetic v magnitude of the secondary based on the decomposition is @xmath32 .",
    "this uncertainty includes both the uncertainty in spectral type and also in the factors used to multiply the template spectra .",

    "this corresponds to @xmath35 @xmath36 at this @xmath0 , which using surface brightnesses from @xcite in turn implies @xmath37 . assuming an extinction @xmath38 , this yielded a distance of @xmath39 pc .    with no reliable emission line velocities ,",
    "an estimate of the mass ratio could not be made .",
    "the fact that gy hya is an eclipsing system constrains the inclination to be greater than @xmath40 70 degrees .",

    "the subclass of sdss j204448 - 045929 ( sdss 2044 , for brevity ) is unknown , as it was recently discovered as a cv in the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "our data span 10 days and had high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios .",
    "the spectra showed intrinsically strong and narrow emission lines , most notably h@xmath5 .",
    "both the absorption and emission line velocities are measureable , although amplitudes are low .",
    "the orbital period , @xmath1 d , is unusually long for a cv .",
    "according to the _ the catalog and atlas of cvs : the living edition _",
    "@xcite , only 7@xmath29 of cvs with known periods ( 440 total , including sdss 2044 ) have periods above 9 hours .",
    "however , a 97@xmath29 monte carlo discriminatory power shows that our preferred period is very likely to be correct .",
    "we find that the absorption and emission line radial velocity curves in figure  [ fig : folpl ] are consistent with @xmath11 .",
    "this allows us to estimate a mass ratio , @xmath45 .",
    "given that the mass of the white dwarf needs to be less than the chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 @xmath34 , this requires that the secondary have a mass @xmath46 @xmath34 .",
    "the period of sdss 2044 ( @xmath47 h ) is well above the 10.0 h upper limit of the evolutionary scenarios of @xcite , so we could not use their results .",
    "given the above mass ratio constraints , we adopt a conservative range of mass for the secondary to be @xmath48 @xmath34 .",
    "the secondary s radius is dependent upon the cube - root of the mass , so the although the uncertainty in mass is large , the radius uncertainty is not : @xmath49 @xmath36 at @xmath1 d. given the range in @xmath50 and a conservative range in white dwarf mass of @xmath51 @xmath52 , the inclination is within @xmath53 degrees .",
    "a clean spectral decomposition gives a secondary spectral type of k4 or k5 , with corresponding synthetic v apparent magnitude of @xmath54 .",
    "using the radius for the secondary , the surface brightness is transformed into an absolute magnitude of @xmath55 . with an extinction of @xmath56",
    ", we find a distance of @xmath57 pc .",
    "similar to gy hya , v392 hya is also listed by @xcite as an unconfirmed u gem star ( dn ) .",

    "@xcite show a spectrum that spans @xmath58@xmath58 3800 - 5000  ; our spectral range is 4210 - 7560 .",
    "therefore , comparison is limited ; the only spectral feature in common is h@xmath25 emission .",
    "@xcite report two periods , @xmath40 8 h and @xmath40 12 h , derived from time - resolved spectroscopy . due to gaps in their time series",
    ", they were unable to distinguish between the two periods .",
    "our time series is comprised of a lone observation in 2002 , followed a year later by 4 consecutive nights , and finally 6 nights scattered through 2004 .",
    "figure  [ fig : v392hya_comp ] shows v392 hya in two different states during january 2004 and february 2003 .",
    "this is evident from the continua .",
    "the mean flux level differs by a factor of @xmath59 .",
    "differences in spectral features are seen , most notably the strength of h@xmath5 emission and the structure of the h@xmath25 line .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : line_features ] and figure  [ fig : v392hya_comp ] , the h@xmath5 line becomes thinner and stronger by a factor of @xmath60 in outburst .",
    "the h@xmath25 line changes from emission superposed on flat continuum during the lower state to emission superposed on a wider absorption line during the higher state .",
    "this is commonly thought to be due to the optically thick accretion disk .    despite the different states , the absorption line velocities from the late - type secondary are measureable in all our data and",
    "yield a best - fit period of @xmath61 d , or 468 min . a monte carlo simulation to discriminate between alias periods returns a confidence level of @xmath62 , which is the lowest for the stars presented in this paper .",
    "emission line velocities based on h@xmath5 had more scatter about the best - fit curve than the absorption line velocities , but fit reasonably well , as seen in figure  [ fig : folpl ] .",
    "the radial velocity curves for v392 hya are also consistent with @xmath11 , leading to an estimate of @xmath63 .",
    "this constrains the inclination to be @xmath64 degrees , assuming a conservative white dwarf mass of @xmath65 @xmath34 .",
    "spectral decomposition was done using the observations in quiescence since the absorption lines ( due to the secondary star ) were more prominent .",
    "visual inspection led to an inferred secondary of spectral type k5 or k6 , with corresponding synthetic v magnitude of @xmath66 . a k5/6 secondary with a period of @xmath67 h implied ( using @xcite ) a mass and radius of @xmath68 @xmath52 and @xmath69 @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "this radius translated the surface brightness calculation of @xcite into an absolute magnitude of @xmath71 , which , when combined with an extinction of 0.2 magnitudes and @xmath22 , gave an inferred distance of @xmath72 pc .",
    "@xcite classify rxj1951.7 + 3716 ( rx 1951 , hereafter ) as a cv , with no specified subclass .",
    "our data span 10 days in 2001 , with coverage over an 8-hour range in hour angle to discriminate the daily cycle alias .",
    "the mean flux level for the spectra is @xmath73 times higher than the other three objects in this paper . in figure",
    "[ fig : subspec ] , the small difference between the upper and lower spectra shows the weak , but present , contribution from the secondary .",
    "the emission lines ( particularly h@xmath5 and h@xmath25 ) are strong and narrow , yielding small uncertainty in emission line velocities ( see table  [ tab : velocities ] ) . despite the weakness of the secondary contribution ,",
    "absorption line velocities are measurable .",
    "the weighted mean period found is @xmath74 d. monte carlo simulations rule out other alias periods with a discriminatory power of @xmath75 . with a small @xmath26 of @xmath76 km s@xmath2 ,",
    "the inclination is expected to be low .",
    "we find that for a white dwarf mass range of @xmath77 @xmath34 and @xmath41 , @xmath78 degrees .",
    "the spectral type of the secondary is estimated to be k7.5 or m0.5 ; the lower spectrum in figure  [ fig : subspec ] is after an m0.5 star has been subtracted .",
    "the synthetic magnitude calculated for the secondary star is @xmath79 .",
    "a secondary mass of @xmath80 @xmath34 is extrapolated from @xcite since the period lies slightly above the cutoff of 10.0 hours . at @xmath81",
    "d , this mass range corresponds to a radius of @xmath82 @xmath70 .",
    "@xcite surface brightnesses were converted into an absolute magnitude of @xmath83 .",
    "the extinction value used is large ( @xmath84 ) due to the fact that rx 1951 is only @xmath85 degrees from the galactic plane .",
    "we find rx 1951 to be at a distance of @xmath86 pc .",
    "it is not surprising to find that this source is closer than the other three due to its greater apparent brightness .",
    "we find orbital periods for these four systems to be above 7 hours ; the period of sdss 2044 , @xmath1 d is notably long for a cv . in longer - period systems ,",
    "the secondaries are usually cooler than expected for main - sequence stars filling their roche lobes at the observed period @xcite . referring to the plot of spectral type vs. period in @xcite ,",
    "it is clear that the four secondary stars in this paper do not lie on zero - age main sequence ( zams ) evolutionary tracks , but rather are significantly cooler , most likely due to commencement of nuclear evolution prior to the onset of mass transfer @xcite .",
    "although the models of @xcite do not apply to periods above 10 hours , and thus may not be directly applied to sdss 2044 and rx 1951 , these two systems are the furthest from the zams .",
    "the systems in this paper have been selected based on their longer periods .",
    "therefore , they do not represent the full range in cv periods .",
    "for example , dwarf novae with hydrogen - rich secondaries have periods as short as 75 minutes .",
    "a goal of studying cvs is to obtain an accurate catalog of their population .",
    "to do so , different methods of cv discovery are essential , as is evident from the subset presently studied .",
    "v392 hya was identified in the edinburgh - cape blue object survey , while sdss 2044 and rx 1951 were discovered by sdss and rosat , respectively .",
    "the wide range in techniques and energies is beneficial for finding these systems .",
    "we find distances to the cvs via spectroscopic parallax .",
    "this method relies on surface brightness calculations of the secondary star filling its roche lobe , but more importantly upon accurate identification of the secondary s spectral type .",
    "we are able to detect and deduce the spectral type ( via spectral decomposition ) of the secondary star to within one subclass .",
    "this is sufficient to yield distances with 15@xmath29 uncertainty in favorable cases .",
