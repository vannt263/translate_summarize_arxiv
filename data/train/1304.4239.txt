    "six galaxies with measurable r23 fall under this classification .    in practice ,",
    "the objects described in # 3 are difficult to evaluate ; their imaged counterparts are sometimes ambiguous due to their faintness and uncertain position within the blind - search slit .",
    "therefore , in this paper we focus on the former two classes . for completeness , in tables 2 and 3",
    "we list the subset of these objects where r23 could be measured ; however , we do not consider them further in this paper .",
    "the deimos observations of these followup slit - masks were carried out in january 2011 and january 2012 .",
    "a summary of observations for each followup mask is given in table [ obstable ] . in four of the five masks",
    ", we used slit - widths and pas that were matched to the search data ( 1.5  wide and 90  east of north ) . on mask l , in order to better locate objects detected through blind spectroscopy , we used a slit orientation which is orthogonal to the venetian blind search slits .",
    "this method also allowed for narrower slits ( 1.2 ) .",
    "all observations were carried out using the the gg495 blocking filter with 830 g grating . under this configuration",
    ", we achieved a spectral resolution of 3.7    ( 2.9  ) for a source that fills the 1.5   ( 1.2 ) slit .",
    "the grating angle was chosen to give a central wavelength of 7270  , with blue coverage down to 5500  for most slits .",
    "the deimos spectra were reduced using the deep2 deimos data reduction pipeline @xcite , with an updated optical model for the 830 g grating ( p. capak , private communication ) .",
    "the data were flux calibrated using observations of several spectrophotometric standard stars , taken through a 1.5  slit at the parallactic angle .",
    "the stars used were g191b2b , gd50 , feige 66 , feige 67 , and hz 44 @xcite , and the data for each was taken from the eso spectrophotometric standard star database .",
    "sensitivity functions derived from these stars differ systematically between observations , with offsets up to 30% . after shifting the lower sensitivity functions to match the highest one , the observations agree at the 2 - 3% level , indicating an excellent relative calibration .",
    "finally , we have verified that the effects of differential atmospheric refraction have a negligible impact on our measured line flux ratios . in order to quantify possible differential slit losses",
    ", we calculate the component of the atmospheric refraction that falls perpendicular to the slit in each observation ( frame ) of each mask .",
    "the worst case occurs on mask l , where the slits are narrowest and the slit - pa was the furthest from parallactic . for these data , the refraction ( perpendicular to the slit ) between 6000   ( near [ ] ) and 8000   ( near [ ]  and h@xmath23 ) ranges from 0.04 to 033 @xcite .",
    "therefore , since the guiding was done in the r - band ( in between the observed wavelengths of the emission lines ) , we estimate the slit - losses on the red and blue parts of our spectra differ by no more than 4% ( for 1  seeing ) . in most frames ,",
    "the effect is even smaller , so we conclude that no systematic correction is needed to interpret our emission line ratios .      in order to derive stellar masses (  [ analysis ] ) , we use the wide range of imaging data provided by the cosmos team .",
    "a more detailed description of the catalogs can be found in @xcite and @xcite . in summary ,",
    "the photometric data include galex imaging , a wealth of ground - based , broad - band optical and near - infrared imaging , and the four _ spitzer_/irac bands .",
    "furthermore , our sed fits are improved by the inclusion of intermediate - band imaging , and updated subaru / suprimecam @xmath28-band data ( from observations made with the new , fully depleted , red - efficient ccds ) .",
    "since the optical and near - infrared photometry are performed in 3  apertures on data with homogenized psfs ( 1.5  fwhm ) , we apply a point source aperture correction of -0.28 magnitudes to all optical and near - infrared bands . for the irac data we use 3.8  diameter apertures , and apply point source aperture corrections of -0.29 , -0.33 , -0.51 , and -0.59 magnitudes to bands one through four .",
    "no aperture corrections are applied to the galex data , as these magnitudes were derived from fits to the psf .",
    "finally , we note that the recommended zero point offsets have been applied @xcite , and a galactic foreground extinction correction is made using the @xcite extinction curve with e(b - v ) = 0.019 .",
    "in total , we identify 47 galaxies at @xmath0 ; of these 34 have complete coverage of the r23 ( [ ] + [ ] / h@xmath23 ; @xcite ) metallicity indicator .",
    "their spectra are shown in figure [ allspec ] .",
    "the remaining 13 galaxies at these redshifts either have essential lines lost in the oh airglow spectrum , or are class # 3 objects ( described above ) , where the observed spectrum is especially faint because the galaxy may not be centered in the slit .",
    "only six class # 3 objects ( without mass measurements ) have r23 measurements ; their spectra are shown in grey at the bottom of figure [ allspec ] . excluding these objects",
    "leaves 28 galaxies with both mass and r23 constraints . in ",
    "3.3 we show that two of these galaxies may contain active nuclei , so we adopt a final sample that includes the remaining 26 star - forming objects .",
    "emission line fluxes are measured for all of the @xmath0 galaxies that we identified .",
    "gaussian profiles are fit to each line , and uncertainties are determined through a monte carlo simulation where noise is added to the spectrum and the fits are repeated . for [ ] , the two doublet components are fit simultaneously . as an example , figure [ example_spec ] shows a typical spectrum and the gaussian fits to the emission lines .    to facilitate a correction for h@xmath23  stellar absorption , we also measure emission line equivalent widths . because it can be difficult to assess the uncertainty on the continuum flux density when it is measured spectroscopically , we compare two methods . on one hand , we measure the equivalent widths directly from the spectra . in 25/28 objects in our sample , we detect continuum , although it is sometimes weak . as a second method",
    ", we compare the emission line fluxes from the deimos data to the continuum under the emission line from the sed fit ( described below ) . after accounting for a systematic offset ( because the emission line fluxes are subject to slit losses but the sed fits use total fluxes )",
    ", the equivalent widths measured by these different techniques agree to within 50% .",
    "we adopt this level of uncertainty on the h@xmath23   equivalent widths .",
    "finally , having measured the fluxes and equivalent widths of our emission lines , we apply a correction for the stellar absorption .",
    "because the stellar absorption component is much broader than the emission line , this correction depends on the spectral resolution . at the resolution of our data ,",
    "the correction is approximately 1    in equivalent width @xcite .",
    "while the amount of absorption also depends slightly on the age of the stellar population , the main source of uncertainty in this correction is from the observed h@xmath23   emission equivalent width , as discussed above .",
    "we propagate this error in our h@xmath23  fluxes and the metallicities that we infer in ",
    "[ calc_metal ] .",
    "stellar masses are determined by fitting template stellar populations to the broad- and intermediate - band photometry described in  2 .",
    "for this task , we use fast ( fitting and assessment of synthetic templates ; @xcite ) .",
    "the choice of population synthesis templates can have an important impact on the properties derived from seds , because the contribution from the ( infrared - bright ) thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) stars differs from model to model .",
    "the most widely used templates are bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ; bc03 ) , @xcite , and charlot & bruzual ( 2007 ; @xcite ) ; the latter two options provide a larger contribution from tp - agb stars ( and correspondingly smaller masses ) .",
    "nevertheless , the proper contribution from tp - agb stars remains a subject of debate @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to facilitate comparisons with the literature , we derive stellar masses using the bc03 models .",
    "we have verified that the charlot & bruzual and maraston et al .",
    "models produce stellar masses that are systematically smaller by approximately 0.1 dex .    in order to assure accurate stellar population constraints , it is also important to account for emission line contribution to our seds .",
    "( the stellar synthesis templates that we fit to the seds do not contain nebular features . failing to remove",
    "emission line contamination can result in incorrectly inferred ages and stellar masses ; @xcite . )",
    "we use our line fluxes to calculate the small contribution from [ ]  to the @xmath29-band , and [ ]  and h@xmath23  to the @xmath30-band . for the galaxies in our sample , we find that 1 - 5% of the @xmath31 band light and 2 - 15% of the @xmath32band light can be attributed to emission lines .",
    "these contributions are subtracted from the @xmath29 and @xmath32 band continuum flux densities .",
    "emission from h@xmath21 , on the other hand , falls between the @xmath28 and @xmath33 bands , so it does not contaminate any of the photometry in the present analysis .",
    "finally , we consider emission line contamination to the intermediate band photometry . in these cases",
    ", the corrections will be larger and more uncertain .",
    "therefore , we exclude the band at 624 nm that includes [ ] , and the band at 827 nm that covers [ ]  and h@xmath23 . the remaining ten intermediate bands should be relatively unaffected .",
    "the grid of stellar population parameters that we fit with fast include : a set of exponentially declining star formation histories with e - folding times , @xmath34 , ranging from 40 myr to 10 gyr ; characteristic stellar population ages ranging from 50 myr to the age of the universe at @xmath0 ; and @xmath35 for a @xcite extinction curve .",
    "additionally , we use a @xcite imf with metallicities of 0.004 , 0.008 , and 0.02 ( solar ) .",
    "supersolar metallicities are excluded , because , as we will show in  [ calc_metal ] , the galaxies in our sample mostly have subsolar to solar gas - phase metallicities .",
    "the derived stellar masses , sfrs , and visual extinction values are given in table [ derived ] .",
    "because of the intermediate band photometry , the dust extinction constraints exclude much of the allowed parameter space .",
    "therefore we use the sed - derived dust constraints to correct our emission line ratios , including these uncertainties in our error budget . in making this correction",
    ", we also account for the fact that nebular extinction is 2.3 times higher than stellar extinction on average @xcite .",
    "while the precise relation between stellar and nebular extinction remains controversial @xcite , we adopt the `` standard '' @xcite relation to allow comparison with other studies .    in  [ fmr_sec ] and [ model_sec ] we draw conclusions based on the sfrs that we have derived from these sed fits . in order to verify that the sfrs are reliable ,",
    "we have carried out an assessment of the systematic uncertainties by comparing sfrs derived from [ ] , h@xmath23 , and the sed fits .",
    "the results , outlined in the appendix , show that the agreement between the different diagnostics is good ; systematic offsets are smaller than 0.2 dex .",
    "this level of uncertainty does not affect our conclusions .      in order to measure the mz relation of star - forming galaxies , it is important to ensure that the observed emission lines do not originate from an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "the typical approach for low redshift galaxies is to use the [ ] / h@xmath23  and [ ] / h@xmath21   emission line ratios ( the canonical bpt diagram ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , for the redshift of our sample , h@xmath21  and [ ]  fall at infrared wavelengths .",
    "therefore , in lieu of followup spectroscopy , we turn to an alternate diagnostic : the mass - excitation ( mex ) diagram @xcite .",
    "this approach , shown in figure [ bpt_mex ] , uses stellar mass as a proxy for the h@xmath21/ [ ]  @xmath36 ratio ( relying on the mz relation ) .",
    "the resulting diagram appears qualitatively similar to the traditional bpt diagram , with agn falling towards the top and right of the plot . in this figure ,",
    "the data for our galaxies ( red points ) are compared to that from the sdss ( contours ) , and the solid black line demarcates the difference between star - forming galaxies , agn , and composite objects ( as defined by @xcite ) .",
    "while the evolution of mz relation compromises somewhat the use of this method , we note that two of our galaxies are found in the area identified as possible agn .",
    "since metallicity evolution works in the sense of shifting the proxy relation between h@xmath21/ [ ]  @xmath36 and mass , it shifts the star - forming locus ( and black threshold curves ) to the right in figure [ bpt_mex ] .",
    "therefore , the two objects in the agn or composite part of the sample may in fact be part of the non - agn distribution ; however , we take the conservative step of excluding them from further analysis .",
    "we list the measured and derived properties of the two candidate agn at the ends of tables [ meas ] and [ derived ] .",
    "interpreting metal abundance measurements requires that we account for systematic uncertainties .",
    "different methods for measuring strong oxygen abundances yield results which are offset by up to 0.7 dex @xcite . on one hand , photoionization models that are used to derive theoretical calibrations ( i.e.  @xcite ) are often based on simplistic assumptions about region geometries and ionizing spectra @xcite . on the other hand , empirical methods , which correlate line ratios with region electron temperatures ( i.e. @xcite ) , generally give lower metallicities than photoionization model - based calibrations @xcite . because electron temperature measurements may be overestimated",
    "when temperature and density gradients are present in regions , it is possible that the empirical calibrations are biased towards low metallicities @xcite .",
    "alternatively , @xcite have suggested that discrepancies between electron - temperature measurements and theoretical strong - line estimates can be explained if the electrons in regions deviate from an equilibrium maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "ultimately , the differences between metallicity calibrations are still not fully understood , but the systematic offsets can be accounted for using a set of transformation equations given by @xcite . in the sections that follow ( except for  6 ) , we use the calibration from kobulnicky & kewley ( 2004 ; hereafter kk04 ) , which is the mean of two theoretical r23 calibrations in the literature ( @xcite and @xcite ) . in ",
    "6 we instead use the calibration from @xcite so that we may compare our data to results from @xcite .",
    "metallicities derived from r23 can be degenerate , since this diagnostic is double valued . at high metallicities , the oxygen lines are weaker because cooling is efficient and the regions have lower electron temperatures . on the other hand , at low metallicities ,",
    "the overall decrease in oxygen relative to hydrogen also imprints a decrease in r23 with decreasing metallicity .",
    "the `` turnover '' metallicity that demarcates the transition between the upper and lower branches of r23 depends on the ionization parameter , where @xmath37 is the ionizing photon rate , @xmath29 is the radius of the region , @xmath38 is the hydrogen density , and @xmath39 is the speed of light .",
    "the parameterization @xmath40 is also commonly found in the literature .",
    "] , and differs among the calibrations that are in the literature . for the typical ionization parameters of our galaxies , and the kk04 calibration , the turnover metallicity is around 12+log(o / h ) @xmath41 , which is reached when log(r23)@xmath42 .",
    "many different methods have been suggested for breaking the degeneracy between the upper and lower branch .",
    "the most rigorous of these is to compare to an alternative metallicity diagnostic .",
    "@xcite advocate for the use of the [ ]  @xmath36/ [ ]   or [ ]  @xmath36 /h@xmath21  ratios to first provide a metallicity estimate that identifies the branch .",
    "however , this method is more challenging at @xmath43 ( requiring infrared spectroscopy to reach very faint [ ]  @xmath44 lines ) , and impossible from the ground at @xmath45 .",
    "the r23 diagnostic , on the other hand , can be measured from the ground out to @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "it is therefore imperative that we learn how to break the r23-metallicity degeneracy without observations of the [ ]  @xmath44 lines .",
    "here , we examine other methods for establishing the r23-branch that have been proposed in the literature .    in figure [ r23vmass ]",
    "we investigate the branch of r23 by plotting four different diagnostics as a function of stellar mass . for comparison ,",
    "we show the four h@xmath23-detected galaxies ( @xmath47 ) from the pears survey ( probing evolution and reionization spectroscopically ; @xcite ) . in the upper left panel , we show that r23 decreases with increasing stellar mass for most of our sample .",
    "furthermore , three of the four galaxies from xia et al . follow the trends from our emission line selected sample .",
    "this diagnostic paints a clear picture : if metallicity decreases as a function of decreasing mass , most of the galaxies in our sample must fall on the upper branch of the r23 indicator .",
    "the two lowest mass galaxies shown in figure [ r23vmass ] ( 1217842 from our sample , and 246 from xia et al . ) hint at a possible turnover at @xmath48 , indicating that these galaxies may fall on the lower branch of r23 .",
    "because it is not ideal to introduce a mass dependence on our metallicity derivations , we explore other emission line diagnostics in figure [ r23vmass ] .",
    "first , we compare to the emission line ratios of [ ] /h@xmath23  and log([]/ [ ] ) @xmath49 o32 as a function of stellar mass .",
    "these line ratios have been proposed to break the r23 degeneracy by @xcite , with low metallicity solutions being preferred when [ ] /h@xmath23@xmath50 and o32 @xmath51 . indeed ,",
    "figure [ r23vmass ] shows that the galaxies above these thresholds also prefer to have higher values of r23 ( and lower metallicities on the upper branch ) .",
    "nevertheless , we still see very little evidence for a substantial population of galaxies extending to metallicities below the r23 turnaround .",
    "the only object that passes both the o32 and [ ] /h@xmath23  thresholds is object 246 from @xcite .",
    "the inference of upper branch metallicities for 3/4 of the objects presented by @xcite contrasts with their lower branch assumption .",
    "these authors argued for lower metallicities because of the relatively high values of [ ] /h@xmath23  and o32 for most of their sample .",
    "however , comparison to the r23 vs mass plot ( upper left ) shows that for at least three of these galaxies , higher metallicity solutions are more plausible .",
    "( although the galaxies presented by @xcite may prefer higher o32 and ionization parameters than the remainder of our sample , metallicity is not a strong function of ionization parameter on the upper branch , so their galaxies still follow our r23-stellar mass correlation . )",
    "ultimately , caution is required when using [ ] /h@xmath23  and o32 to determine the branch of r23 , because these quantities are dependent on the ionization parameter .",
    "observations of high - redshift galaxies show that their line ratios are offset to high values of [ ] /h@xmath23  at a fixed [ ] /h@xmath21  @xcite .",
    "this offset is usually interpreted as evidence for a systematically high ionization parameter @xcite , suggesting that some galaxies deviate from the local metallicity vs. ionization parameter correlation . in summary , attempting to break the r23 degeneracy using quantities that depend on the ionization parameter could erroneously indicate lower branch solutions .    in figure [ r23vmass ]",
    ", we also investigate the use of h@xmath23  equivalent width to select low - metallicity galaxies . @xcite and @xcite have found that , for their emission line selected sample , galaxies are likely to have very low metallicities ( indicated by detectable [ ]  @xmath524363 emission ) when their h@xmath23  equivalent widths are more than 30   ( rest ) . however ,",
    "8/26 galaxies in our sample meet this criterion , and we do not detect [ ]  @xmath53 in any objects .",
    "what is more apparent in figure [ r23vmass ] , is that a cut in h@xmath23  equivalent width merely selects against galaxies with @xmath54 @xmath55 . as we show in ",

    "we infer that it is not straightforward to use h@xmath23  equivalent width to discriminate between upper and lower branch metallicities .",
    "guided by figure [ r23vmass ] we conclude that , in the absence of other metallicity diagnostics , the correlation between stellar mass and r23 is the preferred method to break the r23-degeneracy .",
    "this exercise shows that for @xmath0 galaxies , the maximum value of r23 is reached between @xmath56 and @xmath57 m@xmath2 .",

    "cowie & barger , on the other hand , take the approach of determining dust extinction from sed fits .",
    "however , they do not assume a higher dust extinction for nebular compared to stellar light , as their lower redshift sample suggests that these quantities are consistent .",
    "comparatively , the dust correction adopted by @xcite is cruder ; they use the same extinction ( @xmath396 ) for all galaxies .",
    "if this correction is accurate for the median of their sample , then at high ( low ) masses the dust correction will be underestimated ( overestimated ) , and metallicities will be overestimated ( underestimated ) .",
    "qualitatively , this effect could explain their steeper mz slope .",
    "additionally , it is worth noting that our data are inconsistent with an extrapolation of the savaglio et al .  relation . in the sections that follow , we take the results from @xcite as the best measurement of the high mass , intermediate - redshift mz relation .",
    "the addition of our low mass data allows for new constraints on the evolution of the mz relation . in figure [ mz_compare ]",
    "we compare to the local relation measured from the sdss @xcite . in the mass range @xmath397",
    ", we find a mean metallicity that is 0.12 dex lower than the local relation ( at @xmath398 ) .",
    "this trend confirms that metallicity evolution is relatively slow from intermediate to low redshifts . additionally , as our data are consistent with an extrapolation of the results from @xcite , we agree with their finding that metallicity evolution is more significant at lower masses than at higher masses .",
    "this trend is qualitatively consistent with downsizing in the later phases ( @xmath399 to today ) of galaxy evolution . after high mass galaxies have assembled most of their stars they have also made most of the metals that they will ever produce . at the same time , these higher mass galaxies are less effective at removing metals through winds , and they are also less efficient at accreting gas @xcite . as a result ,",
    "higher mass galaxies are less capable of changing their metallicities after they ve assembled most of their stars . under this scenario",
    ", we would expect lower mass galaxies to evolve onto the present mz relation at later cosmic times .",

    "we compare our data to theoretical predictions for the mz relation in  [ model_sec ] .      in figure [ lzfig ]",
    "we show the metallicity luminosity relation derived from our data .",
    "while the mz relation may represent a more fundamental correlation than the metallicity - luminosity relation , the latter allows comparison to studies where stellar - mass measurements have not been possible . here , we focus on the ultra - strong emission line ( usel ) sample presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "like the galaxies in our sample , the usels lie at intermediate redshifts and are emission line selected .",
    "however , the majority of the usels are low metallicity galaxies with detected [ ]  4363   emission . in figure [ lzfig ]",
    ", we compare the metallicity - luminosity relation of the usels to our sample . in order to make a fair comparison ,",
    "we have calculated the metallicities of the usels using r23 and kk04 , assuming lower - branch solutions .",
    "no correction for dust is applied , which @xcite argue is appropriate for these faint , low mass objects .",
    "it is worth noting that , under these assumptions , the majority of usels have 12 + log ( o / h ) @xmath400 , and would not be classified as extremely metal poor galaxies ( 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath401 ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , this classification changes when direct method metallicities are used : in this case , the oxygen abundances reported by @xcite are 0.03 - 0.74 dex lower ( 0.4 dex on average ) .",
    "figure [ lzfig ] shows clearly that the usels have lower metallicities than the emission - line selected galaxies in the present work .",
    "in fact , this trend is not surprising . because of the differing selections for the usels and the present sample , the former have h@xmath23  equivalent widths that are two times larger ( on average ) than the latter .",
    "this difference translates to higher specific ( mass - normalized ) sfrs for the usels .",
    "one possible explanation is that more actively star - forming galaxies will have b - band luminosities which are high for their stellar mass . in this scenario",
    ", galaxies that fall along the mz relation will move to the right when plotted in the luminosity - metallicity relation , as in figure [ lzfig ] .",
    "however , another explanation is possible . within the local mz relation ,",
    "galaxies with higher specific sfrs have lower metallicities and follow a mass - metallicity - sfr plane called the fundamental metallicity relation ( fmr ; @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the differing metallicities between the usels and the present sample supports the existence of the fmr in the relatively unexplored low mass , intermediate redshift regime .",
    "we next provide the first quantitative test of the fmr for intermediate redshift galaxies below @xmath402 .",
    "in the previous section , we showed that , for a fixed luminosity ( and possibly mass ) , galaxies with higher equivalent width emission lines ( i.  e.  the usels ) have lower metallicities .",
    "this result supports the idea that star formation drives some of the scatter in the mz relation , even out to intermediate redshifts . for local galaxies at fixed stellar mass ,",
    "objects with higher sfrs have lower metallicities than lower - sfr galaxies @xcite .",

    "this finding has recently been confirmed for a large sample of intermediate redshift ( @xmath403 ) galaxies from zcosmos @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , tests for evolution of the fmr have not yet been extended below @xmath404 m@xmath2 . here",
    ", we provide the first such test .    in light of the significant differences between metallicities derived from various calibrations @xcite ,",
    "it is essential that we use metallicities which are derived consistently with those in ( mannucci et al .",
    "2010 , 2011 ; the latter work extends the initial analysis to lower masses ) .",
    "these metallicities are based on the calibration from @xcite , which is semi - empirical .",
    "the high metallicities are derived from the photoionization models of @xcite , whereas the lower metallicities are constrained from direct @xmath405 measurements reported by @xcite . while the maiolino et al .",
    "calibration of r23 does not include a dependence on the ionization parameter , in other calibrations ( i.e.  kk04 ) this dependence is weak on the upper branch of r23 , where the present sample lies .",

    "we show the mz relation , with our data points color coded by three different sfr bins .",

    "this exercise shows clearly that a planar relation exists to lower masses at @xmath25 , with low sfr galaxies showing higher metallicities . to highlight the differences from the fmr ,",
    "the bottom panel shows the residuals from the local plane .",
    "here , we have included the uncertainty in the sed - derived sfr , as it enters into the metallicity that is predicted by the local fmr .",
    "overall , we see that most galaxies have metallicities that fall within 0.2 dex of the local fmr , however , at low masses and low sfrs there are more objects with @xmath411log ( o / h ) @xmath412 , so it is reasonable to question whether these galaxies deviate slightly from the fmr .",
    "therefore , we calculate the mean of the residuals , @xmath413log ( o / h)@xmath414 , and its uncertainty by using a maximum likelihood estimation to account for the individual measurement errors . under this approach ,",
    "the probability of observing a galaxy with a residual @xmath415 and error , @xmath416 is @xmath417 .",

    ", we show the likelihood functions for the mean of the fmr residuals .",
    "these calculations indicate only insignificant deviations from the local fmr . in table",
    "[ resid_table ] , we give the mean of the residuals and its uncertainty for the full sample and various subsamples . at first glance , we see two weakly significant deviations from the local plane : one among the lower mass ( @xmath62 m@xmath2 ) galaxies , and the other for those with intermediate sfrs ( green points ) .",
    "however , upon closer inspection we find that these trends arise solely because of one galaxy ( 23.5 + 2 - 0.33 ) with a metallicity 3.4@xmath422 above the fundamental plane .",
    "( furthermore , this galaxy has a strong influence on our calculation not because its residual is large , but rather because its errors are small . ) without this galaxy , the deviation disappears ( see the thin green curve in the inset of figure [ fmrfig ] ) , and the mean of the residuals fall within 1.5@xmath422 of zero for all of the subsamples listed in table [ resid_table ] .",
    "since any claims of a deviation from the fmr should be based on more than one object , we conclude that our data show no compelling evidence for evolution at @xmath423 .",

    "assigning some galaxies to the lower branch of r23 does not reduce this scatter .",
    "the amplitude of the residuals are larger ( or the about the same for a few galaxies ) when the lower metallicity solutions are adopted . in order to disentangle intrinsic scatter from increased measurement errors in faint galaxies",

    "then , focusing only on the galaxies with @xmath441 m@xmath2 , we generate 10,000 mock realizations of the fmr residuals , perturbing the data in figure 7 by their uncertainties .",
    "we calculate the rms about the fmr for each realization , and find a mean of 0.23 dex , in good agreement with observations .",

    "remarkably , the scatter about the fmr for the present sample is significantly smaller than the 0.4 dex rms found for similar mass galaxies in the local universe @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that the increased scatter in the low mass , @xmath406 fmr is likely the result of increased measurement uncertainties for faint galaxies .",
    "as we introduced in  1 , the mz relation is an important measure of galaxy evolution .",
    "galaxies are not closed boxes ; gas must be accreted from the igm to fuel star formation ( e.g.   @xcite ) , and galactic outflows are commonly observed at both low and high - redshift ( e.g.   @xcite ) .",
    "the mz relation provides an independent , albeit indirect , constraint on these gaseous flows . on one hand",
    ", the accretion of primordial gas will reduce the gas - phase metallicity in a galaxy .",
    "on the other hand , galactic winds can create a deviation from the closed - box model by lowering the gas fraction without changing the metallicity @xcite .",
    "combining our data with the higher mass mz relation provides an important increase in dynamic range that allows for more stringent constraints on models .",
    "our emission line selection of galaxies does not strongly bias our sample or hamper our ability to test theoretical models . in figure [ mz_compare ]",
    "we show that our sample is consistent with the deep2 mz relation reported by zahid et al .",
    "( 2011 ; at least in the limited mass range where our data overlap )",
    ". this agreement can be understood , since the fmr dependence on the sfr is relatively weak .",
    "for example , if the sfrs of our galaxies were biased high by a factor of several , then ( following the @xcite fmr ) an `` unbiased '' sample would have metallicities which are approximately 0.1 dex higher .",
    "an increase in metallicity this large is implausible , as it would imply a lack of metallicity evolution inconsistent with other studies .",
    "likewise , it is worth pointing out that the high s / n of the spectra shown in figures [ allspec ] and [ example_spec ] implies that our sample is not biased towards higher metallicities by a requirement for strong h@xmath23  emission .",
    "the objects which were excluded due to low s / n all fell among the class # 3 objects discussed in  2.1 ; these are either extremely faint , low - mass galaxies with uncertain optical counterparts , or brighter galaxies that fell partially outside our slit .",
    "these galaxies have poorer quality spectra overall ; it is unlikely that their exclusion biases our results .    in order to further verify that our sample is not biased by emission - line selection ,",
    "we place our galaxies on the sfr - m@xmath5 relation ( i.e.  the star - forming main sequence ) in the top panel of figure [ mz_models ] .",
    "this comparison demonstrates that our galaxies do not have extreme sfrs for their stellar masses .",
    "rather , they lie on an extrapolation of the relation reported by @xcite .",
    "our sample could only be significantly biased if the `` true '' sfr - m@xmath5 relation turns over and becomes steeper at low stellar masses .",
    "while this trend is predicted to occur when photoionization heating suppresses star formation in low mass halos , it is not expected to be important above @xmath444 @xcite .",
    "while beyond the scope of this paper , it is worth noting that we do not detect the flattening of the sfr - m@xmath5 relation at low masses which is reported by @xcite",
    ".      one set of models which have recently gained traction are those that adopt an equilibrium between mass inflow ( @xmath445 ) , outflow ( @xmath446 ) , and gas consumption via star formation ( @xmath447 ; @xcite ) .",
    "these models provide a relatively simple interpretation of the fmr as a manifestation of stochastic star formation .",
    "when a galaxy accretes gas , its metallicity is diluted and its star formation increases . the increased star formation serves to consume the extra gas and return the galaxy to its equilibrium .",
    "likewise , a pause in gas accretion will lower star formation rates and increase gas - phase metallicities until accretion resumes .",
    "these models not only predict a mz relation , but also the sfr - m@xmath5 relation that we have shown in figure [ mz_models ] . above . therefore , in the remainder of this section we leverage the two relations to gain the best possible constraints on the models .",
    "quantitatively , we can express the equilibrium condition as ( reproducing equation 1 from @xcite ) : @xmath448 following this assumption , @xcite and @xcite show that sfrs and metallicities can be written as : @xmath449 and @xmath450 the quantities in equations [ sfr_eq ] and [ zmodel ] are defined as follows :    1 .",
    "@xmath451 is taken to represent the mass fraction of oxygen in the ism .",
    "this quantity is converted to the units of 12 + log(o / h ) by taking log(@xmath451 ) = log(o / h ) + log ( @xmath452 ) . @xmath453 and @xmath454 are the atomic masses of oxygen and hydrogen .",
    "@xmath455 is the cosmological baryonic accretion rate , taken from @xcite .",

    "3 .   @xmath457 is a quantity that represents preventive ( rather than ejective ) feedback from gas heating .",
    "there are multiple forms of preventive feedback , and they combine multiplicatively . in the range of halo - masses where our objects lie ,",
    "the most important of these is gravitational heating from virial shock formation in accreted gas .",
    "following @xcite , we take the analytical form given by @xcite : @xmath458 at high masses star formation quenching associated with supermassive black holes becomes important .",
    "while we do not aim to constrain quenching , we implement it following @xcite : @xmath459 the mass scale that we have adopted for @xmath460 is for @xmath461 , and while it may be higher at earlier cosmic times @xcite , the exact scaling is unimportant in the present analysis . at the low mass end , we take the photoionization feedback to be unimportant ; as mentioned above , it is not expected to play a significant role at @xmath444 .",
    "finally , @xcite do note that heating by galactic winds may be important , but the physics of this effect is poorly understood . as such , they adopt an arbitrary parameterization of @xmath462 to consider its qualitative effects . as we will show below , this additional heating is not needed to reproduce the present data .",
    "@xmath463 is the nucleosynthetic yield of oxygen , which is between @xmath464 @xcite . since metallicity calibrations are uncertain @xcite , we take @xmath463 as a free parameter as we search for a normalization that best matches our observed mz relation . hence",

    "@xmath465 is the mass loading factor , which is defined as the ratio of the outflow rate to the sfr : @xmath466 . in the comparison that follows",
    ", we adopt mass - loading factors that correspond ( respectively ) to momentum- and energy- driven winds ( i.e. @xcite ) : @xmath467 @xmath468 the normalizations of these @xmath465 are taken from @xcite .",
    "in addition to these two parameterizations of @xmath465 , we compare to the case of no winds ( @xmath469 ) , also @xmath470 , where the mass loss rate is fixed to the sfr .",
    "finally , the quantity @xmath471 is the ratio of the metallicities of infalling gas and the ism : @xmath472 .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath471 allows for enriched inflows ( possibly from previously ejected material now being re - accreted from the galaxy halo ) .",
    "additionally , it appears in the model for sfr as a simple way to quantify the recycling of enriched halo gas into the ism ( i.e.  an additional source of fuel for star formation ) .",
    "the parameterization of @xmath473 is taken from momentum - driven wind simulations in @xcite : @xmath474 ( although they note that it is a `` crude '' parameterization ) .",
    "while we aim to test models beyond those that are momentum - driven , @xmath473 is not reported for these simulations .",
    "therefore we use this parameterization for all of the models with winds .",
    "for the no wind case we consider @xmath475 , since there can be no recycling of previously ejected material in this scenario .",
    "we consider the effects of modifying @xmath473 in the discussion below .",

    "figure [ mz_models ] shows that , without winds low mass galaxies make too many stars ( and metals ) , and are unable to get rid of the metals that they make .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath473 is not strictly zero in the no - wind simulation @xcite , since infalling gas can be enriched by other galaxies or could represent the accretion of a satellite galaxy .",

    "however , the metallicities predicted by this model turn up at higher masses , owing to the dependence on @xmath473 .",
    "equation [ zmodel ] shows that the predicted metallicities diverge as @xmath473 approaches unity at higher masses .",
    "while the disagreement between the model and data is only apparent in the highest mass bin , the upturn remains implausible .",
    "locally , the mz relation flattens to higher masses @xcite , so the model shown in figure [ mz_models ] crosses the @xmath485 relation at @xmath486 m@xmath2 .",
    "this observation suggests that the mass scaling for @xmath471 given by @xcite may be too steep at high masses .",
    "in addition to the mz relation , we compare the momentum - driven wind model to the sfr - m@xmath5 relation in the top panel of figure [ mz_models ] . in this case",

    "find that both simulations and semi - analytic models are unable to reproduce the population of low mass galaxies with high specific sfrs .",
    "given the uncertainty in @xmath473 , we next consider whether modifying this variable can produce a momentum driven wind model that is a good fit to both the mz and sfr - m@xmath5 data . if we remove the mass - dependence of @xmath473 in equation [ eq_az ] ( @xmath487 ) , the predicted sfr - m@xmath5 relation appears very similar to the constant wind model ( a good match to the data ) , but the predicted mz relation ( not shown ) is far too flat . in summary , modifying @xmath473 does not improve the agreement between the data and the momentum driven wind model .

    "in fact , an energy driven wind model with @xmath487 and @xmath488 appears very similar to the momentum driven wind model shown in _ both _ the top and bottom panels . for this model",
    ", the mz relation model reduces to a straight line that runs through all of the data , and sfrs are slightly under - predicted at low masses .",
    "ultimately , we can not distinguish the momentum driven model from an energy driven model with @xmath487 .",
    "however , we do note that this variable shows some mass dependence in the momentum - driven wind simulations @xcite , so it unlikely that this dependence is non - existent for energy - driven winds .",
    "we therefore conclude that energy - driven winds are unlikely to explain the data .",
    "recent simulations from hopkins et al .",
    "( 2012 ) have suggested that outflows depend strongly on gas surface density , so that winds from low density dwarf galaxies are dominated by energy - driving from supernovae and stellar winds .",
    "more massive star - forming galaxies with higher gas densities , on the other hand , are predicted to prefer momentum driven winds .",
    "the present data do not indicate a mass - dependent @xmath465 ; figure [ mz_models ] shows no evidence for steeper mz and sfr - m@xmath489 slopes towards lower masses .",
    "this analysis ( and figure [ mz_models ] ) shows that there may be a tension between the data and the equilibrium model .",
    "on one hand , models which best match the mz relation under - predict the amount of star formation in low mass galaxies ( and even intermediate masses probed by deep2 ) .",
    "likewise , models that best reproduce the sfr - m@xmath5 relation over - predict the metallicities of galaxies .",
    "this trend can be understood as a generic property of the models , because both equations [ sfr_eq ] and [ zmodel ] are proportional to @xmath490 ; changes in these model components alter the mz and sfr - m@xmath489 relation _ in the same manner_. however , if preventive feedback from gas heating has been overestimated ( @xmath457 underestimated in equations [ sfr_eq ] and [ zeta_grav ] ) , then sfrs can be increased without modifying the mz relation . in fact , @xcite note that @xmath491 is taken from simulations that do not include metal - line cooling @xcite , and raise the question of whether this effect is important . alternatively ,",
    "if @xmath457 is correct , then the data may suggest a deviation from the equilibrium model .    ultimately , we conclude that this disagreement remains subtle .",
    "while we have argued that emission line selection does not largely bias our results , we can not rule out a small effect . as an example , if the sfrs presented in figure [ mz_models ] are high by 0.1 dex , we would expect an unbiased sample to have an sfr-@xmath492 relation that agrees better with the momentum driven wind model at low masses . additionally , according to the fmr , sfrs which are 0.1 dex lower",
    "should be accompanied by metallicities which are around 0.03 dex higher , in even better agreement with the momentum driven wind mz relation . even without emission - line selection bias ,",
    "it is important to recall that the [ ] , h@xmath23 , and sed - based sfr indicators discussed in the appendix differ systematically by up to 0.2 dex . however , modifying the sfr under these scenarios can not satisfactorily bring the data in line with the momentum - driven model . even in the higher mass data alone , this model predicts a steeper sfr-@xmath493 relation than the deep2 result @xcite ; therefore , the discrepancy which we have identified is apparent in a magnitude - limited sample .",
    "we conclude that h@xmath21  followup spectroscopy of our sample ( combined with a mass selected control sample ) can definitively assess the effects of emission line selection , while simultaneously reducing errors on dust , sfr , and metallicity .",
    "we leave this work as the subject of a future paper .",
    "finally , it is worth pointing out that systematic uncertainties in our metallicity calibration can not explain the discrepancy between the data and models .",
    "@xcite show that local ( sdss ) mz relations have similar low mass slopes under most calibrations . the @xcite calibration and the direct - method electron temperature calibration @xcite are two exceptions both produce mz relations that are steeper than what we have used here .",
    "hence , if we calculated metallicities in the same way as tremonti et al . or by using electron temperatures , the tension between the data and models would be amplified . on the other hand ,",
    "the calibrations reported by @xcite and @xcite give mz relations that are flatter than most .",
    "however , we note that they also have metallicities around 0.5 - 0.7 dex lower than those from kk04",
    ". these lower metallicities would introduce other difficulties , as they would require normalizing yields that fall below the plausible range indicated in @xcite .",
    "in this work we have placed the first constraints on the low mass , intermediate redshift mz relation . by using emission line selection in the cosmos field ,",
    "we are able to efficiently identify and measure the metallicities from 26 galaxies reaching masses of @xmath1 m@xmath2 at @xmath494 . combined with previous measurements from magnitude limited samples , these data",
    "extend our knowledge of the mz relation to masses an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "this limit is comparable to the low mass limit of the local mz relation determined from sdss data .",
    "therefore , for the first time we are able to measure the metallicity evolution of intermediate redshift galaxies at @xmath495 m@xmath2 . compared to the @xmath485 relation reported by @xcite",
    ", we find an average metallicity that is 0.12 dex lower for galaxies with @xmath496 we show that this measurement is consistent with an mz relation that evolves more strongly at low stellar masses .",
    "we interpret this mass - dependent evolution as consistent with downsizing trends , where higher mass objects have less leverage to alter their gas - phase metallicities after most of their stars have been assembled .",
    "an important development in our understanding of metallicity evolution is the discovery that the scatter in the relation can be reduced by accounting for star formation .",
    "this measurement was quantified as a plane , and dubbed the fundamental metallicity relation ( fmr ) by @xcite . using the present sample , we find that a planar relation does indeed exist among low mass , intermediate redshift galaxies .",
    "consistent with the findings of mannucci et al .",
    ", we see no evidence for evolution of the fmr , as our emission - line selected sample falls in good agreement with their @xmath497 fmr @xcite .",
    "furthermore , while the lowest mass galaxies in our sample show significant scatter with respect to the fmr , we attribute this scatter to measurement uncertainties for faint galaxies . using a monte carlo simulation , we determine that the intrinsic scatter is consistent with zero , and should be less than 0.16 dex ( 95% confidence ) at @xmath62 m@xmath2 .",
    "the mz relation is an important probe of galaxy evolution models , as accretion and galactic outflows modulate the gas - phase metallicities of galaxies .",
    "hence , comparison to model predictions can help us to gain insight into galaxy formation .",
    "we have combined our mz relation with the sfr - m@xmath5 correlation that is also measured from our data , taking higher mass data from the literature @xcite .",
    "we compare to the family of models outlined in @xcite , where it is assumed that galaxies prefer to maintain an equilibrium between inflows , outflows , and star formation @xcite .",
    "we find that models which predict the mz relation may under - predict the sfrs of low mass galaxies , and at the same time , models that predict the sfrs of low mass galaxies tend to over - predict their metallicities . while this finding could represent a breakdown of the equilibrium model in low mass galaxies , it could alternatively be an indication that feedback from gas - heating has been overestimated in simulations ( i.e.  @xcite ) . to solidify this result ,",
    "we have begun h@xmath21  and [ ]   spectroscopy to followup the present sample and simultaneously measure a mass - selected control sample .",
    "these data will clarify the effects of emission line selection and greatly reduce the statistical uncertainties in our metallicity , dust , and sfr measurements .    to conclude",

    "in  [ fmr_sec ] and  [ model_sec ] we draw conclusions from sfrs that we derived from sed fits ; therefore , it is important that we use reliable sfrs . in order to assess systematic uncertainties",
    ", we compare this measurement to two additional sfr indicators : h@xmath23  and [ ] .",
    "for the h@xmath23  method , we use the dust extinction from the sed fits , scaled up by a factor of 2.3 to account for the difference between stellar and nebular extinction @xcite .",
    "we also correct the h@xmath23  fluxes for the small amount of stellar absorption , as discussed above .",
    "next , the h@xmath23  luminosities are converted to h@xmath21 , assuming a balmer decrement of 2.8 .",
    "we then use the h@xmath21-sfr calibration given by @xcite , scaled appropriately to a @xcite imf . to derive sfrs from [ ]  luminosity",
    ", we use the calibration given by @xcite , which includes an @xmath498 dependence , but does not require that the line measurement be corrected for dust .    in order to make a direct comparison to the sed - derived sfrs , we must correct the emission line fluxes for both slit losses and and extraction aperture losses . rather than model these losses ( which would not account for uncertainties in the absolute flux calibration ) ,",
    "we compare our data to narrowband imaging in cosmos .",
    "first , we infer the emission line flux from the narrowband ( nb816 ) photometry , using the methods outlined in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since the nb816 bandpass has a non - uniform throughput , we calculate a correction to this flux based on the relative throughput at the observed wavelengths of the emission lines .",
    "( this correction can be important , since it is not unusual that both of the [ ]  doublet lines are found away from the central wavelength of the nb816 filter . )",
    "because the cosmos catalog contains total magnitudes ( under the reasonable assumption that the galaxies are unresolved with 1.5  fwhm spatial resolution ) , the line fluxes inferred from narrowband imaging are not subject to aperture losses . for 17 galaxies in our sample with emission lines that are bright enough to be detected in the narrowband imaging , we can infer the aperture losses by comparing these narrowband imaging fluxes to our spectroscopic fluxes .",
    "we find typical correction factors of 1.1 - 2.0 , with a median of 1.4 .",
    "we adopt this average correction to explore systematic differences between star formation indicators .",
    "figure [ sfr_cf_fig ] compares the sfrs derived from the seds , h@xmath23 , and [ ] .",
    "in addition to the sed fits described in  3.2 ( which use exponentially declining star formation histories with @xmath34 as a free parameter ; red points ) , we also make the comparison for constant star - forming models ( blue points ) .",
    "this exercise shows that the sfrs derived using different methods are correlated , so that we can easily distinguish the galaxies with high and low sfrs .",
    "however , figure [ sfr_cf_fig ] also shows that there are systematic shifts as large as 0.2 dex between the different estimators . determining the most accurate star formation indicator is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "ultimately , a systematic uncertainty of 0.2 dex does not affect our conclusions . in ",
    "[ fmr_sec ] , we show that the scatter in the mz relation is correlated with sfrs . as with the local fmr , metallicity depends only weakly on the sfr , so that a 0.2 dex offset in sfr translates to a 0.03 dex shift in the metallicity predicted by the local fmr @xcite .",
    "this difference in metallicity is much smaller than the uncertainties on the fmr residuals shown in figure [ fmrfig ] .",
    "likewise , in  [ model_sec ] we use our sfr - m@xmath5 relation to constrain models . however , 0.2 dex of systematic uncertainty is small compared to the dynamic range of sfrs shown in figure [ mz_models ] .",
    "an systematic offset is unlikely to alter our conclusions , as the sfr - m@xmath5 trends discussed in  [ model_sec ] can be seen ( albeit less obviously ) from the higher mass data alone ."
