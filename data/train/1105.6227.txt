    "interacting binaries containing accreting white dwarfs constitute a large fraction of the population of bright galactic x - ray emitters . these systems , including both persistent and transient sources ,",
    "display a rich variety of properties , determined mainly by the strength of the white dwarf s magnetic field and the nature of the mass donor star ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "most accreting white dwarfs are found in cataclysmic variables , where accretion proceeds through roche - lobe overflow .",
    "the mass donor in these systems is typically a main sequence star or another white dwarf , but also sub - giant and giant companion stars have been observed .",
    "symbiotic systems , where a white dwarf accretes from the stellar wind of a massive supergiant , have also been detected as x - ray sources .",
    "the system discussed here is the only known x - ray binary composed by a white dwarf ( ) and a hot sub - dwarf star ( ) .",
    "hot sub - dwarfs are evolved low mass stars that lost most of their hydrogen envelopes and are believed to be in the helium core burning stage ( for a recent review on hot sub - dwarfs see @xcite ) .",
    "they are spectroscopically classified in different types : sdb ( with effective temperature t@xmath325,00028,000 k ) , sdob ( with t@xmath333,00040,000 k ) , and sdo ( with t@xmath840,000 k ) .",
    "one possible mechanism responsible for the loss of their hydrogen envelopes is non - conservative mass transfer in a binary @xcite .",
    "being one of the brightest hot sub - dwarfs ( apparent magnitude v=8.3 ) ,  has been the object of several studies in the optical / uv wavebands .",
    "the first spectroscopic observations led to its classification as a sub - dwarf of o6 spectral type @xcite and showed radial velocity variations , later found to be caused by orbital motion with a period of 1.55 days @xcite .",
    "no spectroscopic evidence for a secondary could be found , leading to the early suggestion that the companion could be a white dwarf @xcite .",
    "soft x - ray emission from the direction of  was first detected with the _ einstein observatory _ in 1979 , but it could be studied in detail only with a _",
    "rosat _ satellite observation performed in 1992 .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "data showed a very soft spectrum and led to the discovery of a strong modulation with a period of 13.2 s @xcite . while the periodicity clearly indicated the presence of a compact object , the poorly constrained spectral fit resulted in a large uncertainty in the x - ray luminosity , making it impossible to distinguish between a neutron star and a white dwarf .",
    "thanks to a long observation carried out with the satellite in may 2008 , we could establish that the subdwarf s companion is a white dwarf .",
    "its x - ray luminosity , well constrained by the high quality  spectrum , is much smaller than that expected from a neutron star accreting in the stellar wind of .",
    "the measurement of the x - ray pulse delays induced by the orbital motion , and the discovery of the x - ray eclipse , allowed us to derive the x - ray mass function and to constrain the system s inclination .",
    "this information , coupled to the accurately measured optical mass function , gives the masses of the two stars : m@xmath9 = 1.50 @xmath0 0.05 @xmath1 for the subdwarf  and m@xmath10 = 1.28@xmath00.05 @xmath1 for its white dwarf companion   @xcite .",

    "shocks are formed in the accretion column above the white dwarf and the hot plasma in the post - shock region emits hard x - rays .",
    "this hard component is usually fit with multi - temperature plasma models ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , but , as a first approximation , it can be described by a thermal bremsstrahlung with temperature kt@xmath330 ( m/@xmath1 ) r@xmath75 kev , where m is the white dwarf mass and r@xmath76 its radius in units of 10@xmath77 cm .",
    "part of the hard x - ray emission may be intercepted and reprocessed by the white dwarf surface , giving rise to uv and soft x - ray thermal emission , with blackbody temperature of tens of ev .",
    "the relative importance of the soft and hard component depends on several factors , including geometrical effects , the white dwarf mass , magnetic field , accretion rate per unit surface , with the consequence that the observed values of the ratio @xmath78 span a large range @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath78 @xmath310 observed for  is rather high , but not uncommon .",
    "for example , similar or larger values are found in eu uma , dp leo , and rx j10072016 @xcite .",
    "the blackbody temperature we derived for the soft component , as well as the dimensions of the emitting surface are well within the range of values measured for the polars . on the other hand , the best fit temperature of the bremsstrahlung component ,",
    "kt@xmath798 kev is rather small if one considers that , based on the relation mentioned above , massive white dwarfs should have the highest shock temperatures .",
    "this discrepancy might have to do with the unique properties of this white dwarf , which accretes from a low density stellar wind rather than through roche - lobe overflow .",
    "the intensity and configuration of the magnetic field is also relevant for the properties of the x - ray emission , and might explain the differences between this system and classical cataclysmic variables",
    ". an upper limit on the dipolar field of  can be set by the requirement that its magnetospheric radius , r@xmath80 , be smaller than the corotation radius r@xmath81 = ( g m@xmath10 p@xmath82/4@xmath56)@xmath83 = 9@xmath610@xmath84 cm . since r@xmath80 is defined by balancing the magnetic pressure and the ram pressure of the accreting matter , this translates in an upper limit on the white dwarf magnetic moment @xmath852@xmath610@xmath86 g cm@xmath62 .",
    "however , the above condition does not exclude the possibility that the source be in the sub - sonic propeller regime , in which r@xmath80@xmath24r@xmath81 , but the matter is too hot to accrete @xcite . using the equation that defines the transition between the accretion regime and the subsonic propeller regime @xcite , we obtain an upper limit @xmath88@xmath243 10@xmath89 g cm@xmath62 , corresponding to a field of the order of 1 kg at the white dwarf s surface .",
    "early type stars emit x - rays with relatively soft thermal spectra ( kt@xmath30.5 kev ) and luminosity proportional to the bolometric luminosity .",
    "the average relation l@xmath17 @xmath310@xmath90 l@xmath91 has been derived from the observations of main sequence , giant and supergiant stars of o spectral type . the x - ray emission is believed to originate from hot plasma heated by shocks and instabilities in the strong stellar winds of these stars @xcite . despite their very high effective temperature , o type sub - dwarfs are much fainter than main sequence stars , and , up to now , x - ray observations provided only an upper limit of @xmath310@xmath38 erg s@xmath5 for the sdo star bd 3@xmath132179 @xcite .",
    "the x - rays we detected during the eclipse are well described with a bremsstrahlung of temperature 0.5 kev and luminosity 2@xmath610@xmath7 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "given the bolometric luminosity of  l@xmath91=10@xmath92@xmath93 , this corresponds to a ratio l@xmath17/l@xmath91 = 7@xmath610@xmath70 .",
    "thus , both from the spectral and luminosity point of view , the observed x - ray flux is consistent with emission from . to our knowledge",
    ", this could be the first detection of x - ray emission from a sdo star .",
    "further observations of this system , as well as searches for x - ray emission from other members of this class , can provide interesting information on the properties of x - ray production in stellar winds spanning a large range of parameters , from hot sub - dwarfs to supergiants .",
    "is the only known x - ray binary containing a massive white dwarf accreting from a hot sub - dwarf . in principle , other systems of this kind , with a luminosity of @xmath310@xmath4 erg s@xmath5 , could be detected even at distances of several kpc by the current x - ray satellites .",
    "however , due to the very soft spectrum , the observed flux is very sensitive on the amount of interstellar absorption .",
    "for example , a column density of 3@xmath610@xmath94 @xmath23 would reduce by one order of magnitude the observed epic count rate of , making it difficult to identify other sources of this kind in the galactic plane only through x - ray observations (  is at galactic coordinates l=254@xmath13 , b=19@xmath13 ) .",
    "on the other hand , also from the point of view of the optical properties , this system seems quite uncommon .",
    "in fact ,  is rather atypical compared to other sdo stars @xcite , which on average are less massive ( m@xmath30.5 @xmath1 ) , less luminous , and have a higher surface gravity .",
    "this is probably a result of its evolution in a close binary in which a common envelope phase occurred , as clearly indicated by several arguments .",
    "the low h abundance ( x@xmath22@xmath30.19 , @xcite ) , suggests that  is the stripped core of an initially much more massive and larger star . also the high abundance of n and low abundance of c",
    "confirm that its present surface layers once belonged to the outer part of the hydrogen - burning core of a massive star .",
    "slightly different evolutionary scenarios have been proposed to explain this system .",
    "one possibility is that  descend from a fairly massive progenitor that began to fill its roche lobe before helium ignition ( case b evolution ) and is currently in a core he - burning phase @xcite . in this case",
    ", the mass of the he star is related to that of its progenitor by m@xmath95=0.043 m@xmath96 @xcite , implying that  was originally a star of @xmath38 @xmath1 .",
    "two other possibilities have been considered by @xcite .",
    "the first one is that  consist of a degenerate co core , surrounded by a helium envelope with a he - burning shell at its base . in this scenario",
    ", it would be the core of a progenitor of @xmath35 @xmath1 which lost mass during a common envelope event when it was on the early asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "alternatively ,  could be burning hydrogen in a shell , being the remnant of a star which shed its envelope while on the thermally pulsing agb .",
    "however , this possibility is disfavored since it predicts a mass of only @xmath30.6 @xmath1 for the sub - dwarf .    at the observed mass transfer rate , with only a small ( @xmath97 ) fraction of the total mass lost in the subdwarf s wind accreted , the white dwarf mass is increasing very slowly . at the end of the current he - burning phase ,  will expand and fill the roche - lobe , giving rise to a much higher mass transfer rate .",
    "this will produce a higher x - ray luminosity and possibly bright outbursts like the one seen in the helium nova v445 puppis @xcite , which could be the descendent of a system similar to .",
    "the amount of accreted mass , @xmath30.30.5 @xmath1 ( see figure 1 of @xcite ) , is sufficient to bring the , already quite heavy , white dwarf above the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "however , the fraction of mass that is effectively retained depends on the rate and composition of the accreting matter , on the mass , composition and temperature of the white dwarf , and on the poorly known relevance of other factors , such as , e.g. , rotation , magnetic fields , wind outflows .",
    "thus the fate of  is uncertain .",
    "evolutionary computations for  have been recently performed @xcite assuming the mass accumulation efficiency that takes into account the wind mass loss triggered by the he - shell flashes @xcite .",
    "these indicate that  will reach a mass of 1.4 @xmath1 after only a few 10@xmath98 years of roche - lobe overflow , during which @xmath3(56)@xmath610@xmath55 @xmath1 yr@xmath5 of he - rich matter are steadily converted to c and o , while the unburned matter is ejected by the system trough an optically thick wind .",
    "@xcite assumed that  is a co white dwarf that will explode as a type ia supernova when the chandrasekhar limit is reached .",
    "the fast rotation can increase the mass stability limit above the standard value for non - rotating stars , thus systems like  could be the progenitor of over - luminous type ia supernovae . while an one composition seems more likely for  in view of its large mass ,",
    "also in this case there are some uncertainties and other factors that might play a crucial role .",
    "for example , it has been pointed out that massive white dwarfs can have a co composition as a result of rapid rotation @xcite .",
    "if  is an one white dwarf , an accretion induced collapse ( aic ) might occur , instead than a type ia supernova explosion , leading to the formation of a millisecond pulsar .",
    "there is strong evidence that msp are old neutron stars which underwent magnetic field decay and spin - up due to accretion of mass and angular momentum in low mass x - ray binary systems ( lmxrb ) @xcite .",
    "this evolutionary scenario is supported by the observation of short period x ",
    "ray pulsations in the persistent and/or burst emission of several lmxrb , by the small eccentricity of msp with white dwarf companions in the galactic disk , and by the recent discovery of psr j1023 + 0038 @xcite , the long sought missing - link between the lmxrb and msp phase . on the other hand ,",
    "the formation of msp by aic of accreting white dwarfs ( e.g. , @xcite ) has been considered to reconcile the apparent discrepancy in the birthrate of lmxrb and msp , and it can not be excluded that a fraction of the msp population is formed through aic .",
    "the discovery of psr j1903 + 0327 , a galactic plane msp with a high eccentricity orbit ( e=0.44 ) around a solar mass main sequence star @xcite , gives further evidence for the possibility of directly forming young msp .",
    "the high spin rate and low magnetic field of  make it an ideal candidate for the direct formation of a msp though aic .",
    "is a unique system , but its x - ray properties are in several respects similar to those seen in white dwarfs of the polar and intermediate polar class .",
    "its spectrum consists of a very soft , strongly pulsed , thermal like emission plus a harder component dominating above @xmath31 kev .",
    "the two components have different pulse profiles and show small uncorrelated variations on long time scales .",
    "these similarities suggest that the x - ray emission properties depend mainly on the physical conditions near the white dwarf , with little influence of the large scale accretion scenario ( wind accretion in  wrt roche lobe overflow in cataclysmic variables ) .    with a dynamically measured",
    "mass of 1.28@xmath00.05 @xmath1 ,  is one of the most massive white dwarf currently known and the one with the shortest spin period , only a factor @xmath35 larger than the break - up limit .",
    "it is also the only known white dwarf accreting from the wind of a hot sub - dwarf star .",
    "this system is the outcome of a common envelope evolution , most likely of an original pair of stars with mass of @xmath3810 @xmath1 .",
    "its future evolution might lead to the formation of a neutron star through accretion induced collapse or to the explosion of a type ia supernova .",
    "both possibilities have interesting implications .",
    "accretion induced collapse of a fast - spinning and low magnetic field white dwarf could be a promising scenario for the direct formation of non - recycled millisecond pulsars . in the second case , being the result of the evolution of relatively massive stars ( @xmath389 @xmath1 ) , this would be a type ia supernova formation channel with a short delay time .",
    "future x - ray and optical observations can lead to more accurate determination of the system parameters , providing crucial information to investigate in more detail the past and future evolution of this system .",
    "for example , further observations of the orbital phases including the eclipse can give a more precise measurement of its duration , a better characterization of the x - ray emission from , as well as some information on the structure of its wind by measuring possible variations of n@xmath22 .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopy of the soft x - ray spectral component and deeper observations above a few kev are needed to better compare the properties of this peculiar x - ray binary with those of other accreting white dwarfs , and , in particular , to better constrain the magnetic field geometry and intensity .",
