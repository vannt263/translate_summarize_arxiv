    "during the final 0.2  2 myr of its life , an agb star will undergo radial pulses , which may allow dust condensation in the circumstellar envelope .",
    "radiation pressure on the dust grains and momentum coupling between the grains and the gas results in the formation of an additional slow , dense wind @xcite .",
    "this wind causes the star to lose 20  60% of its mass , truncating its subsequent evolution .",
    "agb stars are uniquely important to many aspects of galactic and stellar astronomy .",
    "mass - losing agb stars are the main source of long - term gas return to the interstellar medium ( ism ) , prolonging the star - formation life of gas - rich galaxies .",
    "agb winds are heavily enriched in li , c , n , f , and s - process elements , and are the largest source of dust input into the ism @xcite , making agb stars an important driver of chemical evolution in galaxies .",
    "the intermediate masses of agb stars make them ideal candidates for probing the star formation histories ( sfhs ) across much of a galaxy s lifetime .",
    "also , because they are widely distributed and easily detected , agb stars are excellent tracers of galactic structure . while unobscured agb stars are among the brightest stars in optical band - passes , they are best studied in the infrared ( ir ) and the near - ir , where emission from warm circumstellar dust peaks and circumstellar extinction is minimal",

    "dwarf irregular ( dirr ) galaxies in the local group provide us with ideal laboratories to study agb stars .",
    "most of these galaxies are undergoing recent or on - going star formation , resulting in a population of agb stars representative of the entire mass range rather than a snapshot of a single agb mass .",
    "the nearby dwarf irregular galaxies are populous enough to capture a substantial number of agb stars in the short - lived mass - loss phase , near enough to resolve the stellar population , and distant enough to encompass the entire galaxy with a small field of view .",
    "_ spitzer s _ ability to detect the entire agb population in a given galaxy also provides us with the means to study the mass and dust injection rate into the interstellar medium ( ism ) , the fate of the ism , and the effect on continued star formation and chemical evolution of the galaxy .",

    "the flux estimates presented here are , of course , overestimates , as they do not exclude the contribution from background galaxies .    in table",
    "[ tab : detstats ] , we also compare the summed flux of sources one magnitude above the trgb to that of one magnitude below the trgb . choosing to compare the relative fluxes within narrow magnitude intervals directly above and below the trgb makes this approach less susceptible to the effects of magnitude - dependent completeness and contamination ( from galaxies ) .",
    "we find that , in general , this ratio is higher for galaxies with more recent star formation .",
    "this correlation confirms that older stellar populations have fewer high - luminosity stars .",
    "ddo  210 and sextans  a do not follow the trend , but this is due to incompleteness within one magnitude below the trgb , since these galaxies are the most distant . lgs  3 is the only other galaxy that does not follow the trend ; this may be due to a combination of photometric incompleteness and low number counting statistics .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the number of super - trgb stars decreases as a galaxy ages , so that the older the stellar population , the higher the underlying stellar mass represented by each super - trgb star . following this premise ,",
    "the @xcite prescription for determining the total stellar mass of a galaxy based on the number of stars brighter than the trgb in the _ l_-band ( 3.76  ) yields stellar masses ranging from @xmath52 ( table  [ tab : compfrac ] ) , assuming an age of 2  gyr for the current super - trgb population and excluding estimates of the numbers of background galaxies from s - cosmos and foreground stars from @xcite .",
    "these masses are uncertain because they are determined using a single age population and because of incomplete sky coverage in some galaxies .",
    "if we adjust the age to coincide with past star formation events ( see  [ sec : compare ] ) , we find a wider range of stellar masses ( table  [ tab : compfrac ] ) . because of the assumption of a single - aged stellar population , our mass estimates , with the exception of the estimates for pegasus  dirr and wlm , are somewhat larger than , but are still within reasonable agreement to , those found by @xcite from the mass - to - metallicity relation .",
    "it is important to determine if photometric incompleteness affects our agb statistics .",

    "the location of the sextans  a trgb is unknown , but assuming it is near @xmath53  mag ( dotted line in fig .",

    "the brightest of these have the strongest mlrs and dominate each galaxy s integrated mlr .",
    "a few of these heavily mass - losing sources are also undetected in the optical ( orange points ) and may prove to be background galaxies .",
    "however , in leo  a , sextans  a , wlm , and ic  1613 , many of these optically obscured , heavily mass - losing sources ( 1 , 2 , 4 , and 5 sources , respectively ) are brighter than the background galaxy cut - off ( @xmath75  mag ) , and are likely true obscured agb stars .",
    "the majority of the agb candidates are in the superwind phase @xcite , i.e. , the mlrs exceed the nuclear - burning mass consumption rate ( @xmath76 ; long - dashed line in fig .  [",
    "fig : massloss ] ) .",
    "mass loss is the dominant evolutionary driver for these stars since they will expel their outer layers before exhausting their nuclear fuel .",
    "the timescale of the agb superwind phase is short ( @xmath20@xmath77  yr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if we assume that each galaxy hosts a broad range of agb star masses , then we may also assume that each agb star loses an average total of 1.5  @xmath63 .",
    "using the mean individual mlrs listed in table  [ tab : avgmlr ] ( averaged over all five combinations of dust composition and effective temperature ) , the superwind timescale we derive ranges from @xmath78  yr , which agrees well with previous estimates .",
    "a consequence of this short timescale is that the integrated mlr of low - mass galaxies may be highly time - variable , as is the case for star clusters @xcite , and must not be over - interpreted . within a few million years",
    ", a mere handful of new , strongly mass - losing agb stars may appear in some galaxies , but not in others , causing a strong increase in the integrated mlr of the former .",
    "therefore , we do not claim that the integrated mlrs quoted here are representative of any particular galaxy trait .",
    "as emphasized in papers i & ii , there are major uncertainties in deriving mlrs for agb stars using only 3.6 and 4.5   photometry .",
    "the first is a degeneracy between @xmath65 and @xmath79 : cool stars with small mlrs can have the same @xmath1 - [ 4.5]$ ] color as warmer stars with strong mlrs .",
    "this uncertainty most strongly affects the bluest agb candidates(@xmath1 - [ 4.5 ] < 0.5 $ ] ) , but is of little consequence for the redder agb candidates , where the mlr is much less sensitive to @xmath66 .",
    "this uncertainty may also be exacerbated by atmospheric molecular absorption , which can affect irac colors , although these effects have not yet been quantified @xcite .",
    "since the reddest agb stars also have the strongest mlrs , the integrated mlr for each galaxy and the individual mlrs for the red stars is robust .",
    "the second major uncertainty lies with the choice of the chemical composition of the agb winds . with no information about the wind compositions",
    ", we must make the unlikely assumption of a single composition for the entire agb population .",
    "the integrated mlrs computed for different wind compositions vary by up to a factor of eight .",
    "while these uncertainties affect the mlrs of individual sources , the integrated mlr is heavily affected by the unfortunate placement of background galaxies in the same region of the cmd as the mass - losing agb stars , as discussed above .",
    "while we have attempted to remove this contamination , we must still emphasize that the integrated mlrs reported here are meant as first - order estimates only .      while massive stars occasionally provide bursts of feedback to the ism when they explode as supernovae",
    ", it is the more numerous , mass - losing stars that dominate long - term gas return .",
    "gas return from massive stars occurs only during and shortly after a burst of star formation , whereas agb gas return is continuous over time and allows galaxies to gradually rebuild an ism while remaining in quiescensce with regard to star formation .",
    "a comparison between the the returned mass and the mass used to form stars ( @xmath80 ) , computed using current integrated mlrs ( bottom panel of table  [ tab : cummlr ] ) and the average sfrs over the last 1  gyr @xcite , shows that each galaxy in our sample has been undergoing a sfr that is unsustainable , with the exception of lgs  3 and ddo  210 . without another source of gas to the ism or a change in star formation rate",
    ", these galaxies will exhaust their supply of interstellar gas ( see table  [ tab : ism ] ) .",
    "we note that there are uncertainties associated with converting sfhs derived from partial fields to global sfhs , but we believe that these sfhs should be qualitatively representative of the galaxies .",
    "it is unlikely that these galaxies can accrete significant amounts of gas from their surrounding environments , as they are all isolated from other systems .",
    "if these galaxies are to maintain their current sfrs , there must be some non - dusty mass loss in addition to the dust - traced mass loss measured here .",
    "if the ism is replenished solely by stellar mass loss ( dusty plus non - dusty ) , then @xmath81 ( table  [ tab : ism ] ) reflects what fraction of the total stellar mass loss is traced by dust .",
    "we find that in sextans  a , wlm , and ic  1613 , dusty mass loss accounts for only 2%  4% of the total mass loss required to replenish the ism at a rate equal to the current sfr , while in phoenix , leo  a , and pegasus  dirr",
    ", this fraction rises to 22%  30% .",
    "previous work by @xcite and @xcite found that roughly 50% of the mass loss is traced by dust in globular clusters .",
    "the very large amount of non - dusty mass loss required to balance the sfrs in sextans  a , wlm , and ic  1613 suggests that the current sfrs in these galaxies are indeed unsustainable .",
    "the agb stars in lgs  3 and ddo  210 are losing mass at a rate faster than new stars are currently being formed .",
    "therefore , barring any outside influences , the mass loss traced by dust in these galaxies is sufficient to replenish the ism at a rate that can sustain the ism recycling rate indefinitely , eliminating the need for other gas return mechanisms such as non - dusty mass loss and gas accretion .    by comparing the mass in each galaxy with the current sfr and dusty mlr",
    ", we can compute the life expectancy of each galaxy , or the timescale before the galaxy runs out of gas .",
    "this timescale is known as the `` roberts time '' @xcite , corrected so that it now includes gas return :    @xmath82    the correction factor is referred to as the recycling factor .",
    "we find that leo  a and phoenix can survive as gas - rich dwarf galaxies for 17  gyr and 76 gyr , respectively , but that pegasus  dirr , sextans  a , wlm , and ic  1613 can continue star formation activity at the current rate for only 2.5  gyr  6.8  gyr , with wlm being the first galaxy to become inactive ( table  [ tab : ism ] ) . for leo  a , phoenix , and pegasus  dirr , dusty mass loss is responsible for an increase of 29%  40% over the uncorrected @xmath83 , while in the remaining three galaxies , dusty mass loss is responsible for a mere 2%  4% increase . for disk galaxies",
    ", @xcite finds that this increase can be significantly larger , although we note that those estimates include mass lost during all stages of stellar evolution .    assuming a closed - box model , and that the average sfr over the last 5  gyr represents the average rate over each galaxies lifetime , then when including gas return from dusty stellar mass loss , we find that the predicted gas - rich lifetimes of wlm and ic  1613 ( @xmath84 3.7 and 4.3  gyr , respectively , see table  [ tab : ism ] ) are shorter than the current estimate of the mean mass - weighted stellar ages for each galaxy ( @xmath85 6.7 and 7.7  gyr , respectively ; * ? ? ? * ) . even if we assume that dusty mass loss accounts for only 10% of the total mass loss , we still find lifetimes that are too short to allow for any current star formation in wlm and ic  1613 ( @xmath865.8 and 5.7  gyr , respectively ) .",
    "this indicates that either these galaxies have been accreting gas from the outside or that they have been very inefficient at using up their initial gas to form stars , although it is unclear what might cause the latter @xcite .",
    "we present part  iii of a _",
    "irac census of agb stars in eight local group dwarf irregular galaxies : phoenix , lgs  3 , ddo  210 , leo  a , pegasus  dirr , sextans  a , wlm , and ic  1613 .",
    "stars brighter than the 3.6   trgb are identified as agb candidates , and we find that 50%  100% of these sources are detected and identified as agb stars in broadband optical photometry .",
    "an optical completeness fraction of 70% agrees within the errors of all eight galaxies in our sample , suggesting that optical surveys of dwarf galaxies are underrepresenting the agb by 30%  40% , due to extinction from circumstellar dust .",
    "we find no trend of decreasing optical completeness with increasing metallicity , as would be expected assuming that dust is more efficiently produced at high metallicities .",
    "this suggests that dust production is not suppressed at low metallicity , although it may form in smaller quantities .",
    "we do however see that the fraction of moderately red ( dusty ) stars that are not obscured in the optical increases in galaxies with higher metallicity .      using the @xmath1 - [ 4.5]$ ] color excess , we compute average individual stellar mass - loss rates ranging from @xmath87 , agreeing well with estimates of agb mlrs in other studies .",
    "mass loss traced by dust does not appear to be inhibited at low metallicity .",
    "the integrated mlrs for each galaxy range from @xmath88 .",
    "normalized to the total stellar mass , we find a range of @xmath89 for lgs  3 , to @xmath90 for leo  a. these rates do not include mass loss that is unaccompanied by dust .",
    "a comparison of the recent ( within 1  gyr ) sfr and the current mlrs reveals that all but two of our galaxies ( lgs  3 and ddo  210 ) can not sustain their current sfr solely through ism gas return from the stellar mass - loss rates measured here .",
    "phoenix , leo  a , pegasus  dirr , sextans  a , wlm , and ic  1613 will all eventually extinguish their gas supply unless there is an additional supply of gas . in these galaxies , mass loss traced by dust can account for only 2% ",
    "30% of the material required to maintain the current sfr .",
