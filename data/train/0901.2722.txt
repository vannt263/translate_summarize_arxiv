    "numerous astronomical observations suggest that large magnetic fields are associated with neutron stars ( nss ) .",
    "indeed , evidence for the existence of binary nss is obtained from binary pulsars , in which one or both nss are seen to have a large magnetic field . in general relativity",
    "such binary systems can not be stationary because they emit gravitational waves ( gws ) which extract energy and angular momentum from the binary , inducing it to inspiral and merge . during the final stages of the inspiral",
    "the gw emission is expected to be strong enough to be relevant for the detectors now operative at design sensitivities and it promises to provide important information on the equation of state ( eos ) regulating the ns matter  @xcite .",
    "in addition to their importance as sources of gws , however , the merger of binary nss is likely to provide important information on the physics of short gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "the coalescence of the two nss , in fact , gives rise , either promptly or after some interval , to a system composed of a torus orbiting around a rapidly rotating black hole ( bh )  @xcite .",
    "the complex plasma physics accompanying this event is probably behind the `` engine '' powering grbs  @xcite .",
    "there is little doubt , therefore , about the importance of assessing the role played by magnetic fields in the inspiral and merger of binary nss . yet , determining this accurately is a remarkably difficult task requiring the solution of the einstein equations together with those of general - relativistic magnetohydrodynamics ( grmhd ) . so far ,",
    "only two grmhd simulations have been reported  @xcite , reaching different conclusions about the importance of very strong magnetic fields ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the aim of this letter is to go beyond these qualitative estimates and provide a first quantitative measurement of the influence of magnetic fields on both the inspiral and the merger of magnetized nss .    by considering a large range of magnetic fields , which includes values more realistic than those used in the works cited above , and two different masses , we find that magnetic fields generally grow _ after _ the merger , when the turbulent motions triggered during the merger by the kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instability amplify any initial poloidal magnetic field producing a toroidal one whose strength rapidly becomes comparable to the poloidal one .",
    "in addition , we find that magnetic fields can , at least in principle , play a role already _ during the inspiral _ if sufficiently strong .",
    "this is most likely due to the magnetic tension , which decreases the ns deformability , increases the compactness , and thus delays the time of merger . in practice",
    ", however , the influence of magnetic fields during the inspiral appears only for values @xmath10 which are unrealistic  @xcite . as a result",
    ", it is very unlikely that present detectors will be able to measure the presence of magnetic fields during the inspiral of nss .",
    "finally , we show that high - order numerical schemes are essential to draw robust conclusions while lower - order methods incorrectly suggest that even strong magnetic fields have no influence at all .",
    "all the results presented here were computed by solving the grmhd equations in the ideal mhd approximation ( _ i.e. _  assuming an infinite electrical conductivity ) and in dynamical spacetimes .",
    "the evolution of the spacetime was obtained using the ` ccatie ` code , a three - dimensional finite - differencing code providing a solution of a conformally traceless formulation of the einstein equations  @xcite .",
    "the grmhd equations were instead solved using the ` whisky ` code presented in  @xcite , thus adopting a flux - conservative formulation of the grmhd equations  @xcite and high - resolution shock - capturing schemes . in particular , we have computed the fluxes using the harten - lax - van leer - einfeldt ( hlle ) approximate riemann solver  @xcite , while the reconstruction was made using the @xmath11rd - order piecewise parabolic method  @xcite . furthermore , to guarantee the divergence - free character of the mhd equations we have employed the flux - constrained - transport approach  @xcite .",
    "the code has been validated against a series of tests in special relativity  @xcite and in full general relativity [ see  @xcite ] .",
    "the system of grmhd equations is closed by an eos and , as discussed in detail in  @xcite , the choice of the eos plays a fundamental role in the post - merger dynamics and significantly influences the survival time against gravitational collapse of the hyper - massive neutron star ( hmns ) likely produced by the merger .",
    "it is hence important that special attention is paid to use eoss that are physically realistic , as done in  @xcite within a conformally - flat description of the fields and a simplified treatment of the hydrodynamics .",
    "because we are here mostly concerned with computing a first quantitative estimate of the role played by magnetic fields rather than with a realistic description of the ns matter , we have employed the commonly used `` ideal - fluid '' eos in which the pressure @xmath12 is expressed as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the rest - mass density , @xmath15 is the specific internal energy and @xmath16 is the adiabatic exponent . while simple , such eos provides a reasonable approximation and we expect that the use of realistic eoss would not change the main results of this work .",
    "all equations are solved on a cartesian grid using the vertex - centered mesh - refinement scheme provided by the ` carpet ` driver  @xcite . differently from  @xcite",
    ", we use here larger fixed refined grids rather than smaller moving ones . while computationally more expensive , this choice reduces the violations in the divergence of the magnetic field due to interpolations in the buffer zones between refinement levels . in this way",
    ", the divergence of the magnetic field on the finest grid ( not including the buffer zones ) is zero to machine precision .",
    "we have used five refinement levels with a 180-degree rotational symmetry around the @xmath17 axis and a reflection symmetry across the @xmath18 plane ( in practice , we simulate only the region @xmath19 ) .",
    "the finest grid has a resolution of @xmath20 and extends up to @xmath21 ; the coarsest grid has @xmath22 and extends up to @xmath23 .",
    "our finest grid therefore contains both nss at all times and each ns is covered with @xmath24 points . in  @xcite the finest grid had @xmath25 , thus with @xmath26 points across each star , and  @xcite had @xmath27 points .",
    "so our resolution is higher than that in the above works , but it is only half of that in  @xcite , and it is barely sufficient to reach convergent results for the inspiral .",
    "the initial data are the same as used in  @xcite and were produced by  @xcite with the multi - domain spectral - method code lorene ( ` http://www.lorene.obspm.fr ` ) .",
    "the initial solutions for the binaries are obtained assuming a quasi - circular orbit , an irrotational velocity field , and a conformally - flat spatial metric .",
    "the matter is modelled using a polytropic eos @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "since no self - consistent solution is available yet for magnetized binaries , a poloidal magnetic field is added a - posteriori using the vector potential @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , @xmath33 parameterizes the strength of the magnetic field , @xmath34 defines where in the ns the magnetic field goes to zero , and @xmath35 determines the smoothness of the potential .",
    "the components of the magnetic field are then computed by taking the curl of the cartesian components of  @xmath36 to enforce that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero to machine precision . here",
    "we set @xmath37 , and @xmath38 to enforce that both the magnetic field and its first derivative are zero at @xmath39 . in  @xcite the magnetic field",
    "was built with an equivalent expression but with @xmath34 set to the pressure in the atmosphere , and in  @xcite the expression used is only slightly different , but @xmath34 is set to be @xmath40 of @xmath41 .",
    "both above works set @xmath42 .",
    "note that the magnetic fields are confined at all times inside the ns matter and hence they can not `` repel '' each other during the inspiral , as claimed in  @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     _ notes . _",

    "we take four different magnetizations ( indicated by the asterisk ) so that , for instance , @xmath58-@xmath61 is a low - mass binary with a maximum initial magnetic field @xmath62 [ the binaries with zero magnetic fields are the same as those evolved in  @xcite ] . in summary",
    ", we consider 8 different binaries that are either unmagnetized or with magnetic fields as large as @xmath63 .",
    "we reinforce a remark already made in the introduction : all astronomical observations and theoretical considerations suggest that the magnetic fields in binary ns systems just before the merger are much smaller than @xmath64",
    ". however , we do consider such large fields here , firstly to compare with those studied by  @xcite and by  @xcite , and secondly because by doing so we can determine important lower limits on the detectability of magnetic fields during the inspiral .",

    "a representative summary is offered in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which reports the @xmath65 component of the @xmath66 polarization ( modulo a phase difference , @xmath70 shows the same behaviour ) .",
    "more specifically , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] highlights the differences in the gws from binaries with different masses , namely @xmath67 ( thick line ) and @xmath68 ( thin line ) , when the initial magnetic field is either zero ( top panel ) or as high as @xmath71 ( bottom panel ) .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] clearly shows that when the nss are not magnetized , the high - mass binary has a larger - amplitude gw emission , it experiences an earlier merger and the hmns at these resolutions collapses to a rapidly rotating bh after only @xmath72 , while the hmns from the low - mass binary does not collapse .",
    "in contrast , when the nss are initially magnetized , the strong magnetic tension most likely reduces the tidal deformations and results in a delayed merger time ( defined as the time when the maximum rest - mass density has a first significant minimum ; _ cf . _",
    "fig  2 or 8 in  @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the additional pressure support coming from the intense magnetic fields is such that neither the high - mass nor the low - mass binary collapse promptly to a bh over the @xmath73 of the simulations ( see the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for a comparison of gws for high - mass binaries with different magnetic fields ) .",
    "overall , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that magnetic fields have a strong impact on the gws emitted after the merger but _ also _ during the inspiral , if sufficiently strong .",
    "if , on the other hand , the magnetic fields are more realistic , _ e.g. _  @xmath74 , then differences appear _ only _ after the merger . for compactness , comparisons of this type can not be presented here but will appear in a longer companion paper ( baiotti et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "while generic , this behaviour depends sensitively on the strength of the initial magnetic field and there exists a critical magnetic field below which the mhd effects during the inspiral are not important . in order to quantify this",
    "we have computed the overlap between two waveforms @xmath75 from binaries with initial magnetic fields @xmath76 as @xmath77 \\equiv \\frac{\\langle h_{_{\\rm        b1 } } | h_{_{\\rm b2 } } \\rangle}{\\sqrt{\\langle h_{_{\\rm b1 } } |      h_{_{\\rm b1 } } \\rangle \\langle h_{_{\\rm b2 } } | h_{_{\\rm b2 } }      \\rangle}}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the scalar product and is defined as @xmath79 and @xmath80 is the fourier transform of the gw @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the noise power spectral density of the detector ( we have here considered ligo ) .",
    "clearly , waveforms that are very similar have @xmath83 .",
    "a general view is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , which reports the overlaps between the unmagnetized binaries and binaries with different magnetizations , _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath84 $ ] , for the two masses considered here ( top and bottom panels , respectively ) .",
    "note that the overlap is relative to the inspiral only [ _ i.e. _  the integral   is cut off at the orbital frequency at merger ] since this is the phase for which our results are convergent ( becoming only consistent after the merger as a result of the development of turbulence ) and because the post - merger evolution can only further decrease @xmath1 .",
    "it is evident that for the high - mass binary ( top panel ) the influence of the magnetic field is noticeable only for very large magnetic fields ( @xmath85 for @xmath86 and @xmath87 for @xmath88 ) .",
    "this is true also for the low - mass binary ( bottom panel ) whose smaller compactness , however , leads to larger overlaps ( _ i.e. _  @xmath89 for @xmath90 ) . in view of these results , of the fact that nss just prior to merger are expected to have magnetic fields @xmath91  @xcite , and that present detectors are sensitive to @xmath92  @xcite",
    ", we conclude that it is very unlikely that the presence of realistic magnetic fields can be detected during the inspiral .",
    "overlap in inspiral waveforms from binaries with different magnetization ; the top and bottom panels refer to the high- and low - mass binaries , respectively.,scaledwidth=37.0% ]",
    "as discussed in detail in  @xcite , during the merger a shear layer develops in the region where the two nss enter in contact . across this layer , the tangential components of the velocity are discontinuous and this leads to the development of a kh instability and thus to the production of vortices [ _ cf . _  fig .",
    "16 of  @xcite ] .",
    "when poloidal magnetic fields are present , this hydrodynamical instability can lead to exponentially growing toroidal magnetic fields , thus increasing the energy stored in magnetic fields .",
    "this mechanism , already observed in newtonian simulations  @xcite but not before in general relativistic ones , is likely to be important for explaining the physics powering short grbs .",
    "taking @xmath60-@xmath93 as a reference , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the evolution of the maxima of the magnetic field @xmath94 ( thick line ) , and of its toroidal @xmath95 ( dashed line ) , and poloidal @xmath96 ( thin line ) components .",
    "a vertical dotted line marks the merger , occurring @xmath97 after the kh instability has started developing . clearly , as long as the kh instability is active , the toroidal magnetic field is amplified exponentially , until it reaches values comparable to the poloidal one ( this is different and more reasonable than what found by  @xcite , where the magnetic field reached energy equipartition values ) .",
    "note that the magnetic field grows considerably also when the hmns collapses to a bh as a result of magnetic - flux conservation in the collapsing ns matter .    as discussed in  @xcite and in  @xcite ,",
    "much in the development of the kh instability and in the subsequent magnetic field amplification depends on the resolution used .",
    "a detailed study of the turbulent regime and magnetic field amplification produced by the merger is extremely challenging and requires resolutions well above the ones that can be afforded now in grmhd simulations .",
    "nevertheless , on the basis of preliminary investigations with different resolutions , we expect the behaviour in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] to be qualitatively correct and , hence , that as long as the kh is active , the poloidal magnetic field is coiled into a toroidal one , increasing it exponentially to values comparable with the poloidal one .",
    "when equipartition among the components is reached , the large magnetic tension suppresses the kh instability , preventing a further growth of the toroidal magnetic field .",
    "an analysis of this process will be presented elsewhere .",
    "evolution of the maxima of the magnetic field @xmath98 ( thick solid line ) and of its toroidal @xmath95 ( dashed line ) and poloidal @xmath96 ( thin solid line ) components for the high - mass case with @xmath99 .",
    "the dotted line marks the merger time.,scaledwidth=37.0% ]",
    "as shown in  @xcite , the use of reconstruction schemes of sufficiently high order is _ essential _ for a correct calculation of the gw signal .",
    "this is stressed also in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , which presents a comparison in the gw emission from the high - mass binary for evolutions made using either a @xmath100nd - order minmod scheme ( top panel ) or a @xmath11rd - order ppm one ( bottom panel ) with the same grid structure and resolution used in the previous runs . in both cases",
    "a thick line refers to the unmagnetized binary while a thin line to the binary with @xmath90 . clearly ,",
    "while the evolutions with minmod show only minimal differences between the magnetized and unmagnetized case ( @xmath101 over the whole waveform ) , the evolutions using ppm show considerable differences ( @xmath102 ) , both during the inspiral and after the merger .",
    "more precisely , although we use exactly the same initial data , the binaries evolved with minmod merge almost two orbits earlier than those evolved with ppm [ _ cf . _  vertical dotted lines in fig",
    ".  [ fig4 ] ] . additionally , the unmagnetized binary evolved with minmod does not collapse to a bh , in contrast to what happens when using ppm at these resolutions .",
    "these differences are due to the numerical dissipation of the @xmath100nd - order method , which is inadequate at these resolutions .",
    "this could explain why the calculations in  @xcite , where a @xmath100nd - order reconstruction and a lower resolution were used , show only small differences between unmagnetized and magnetized binaries .",

    "we have presented accurate simulations of the inspiral and merger of magnetized nss and found that magnetic fields have an impact _ both _ during the inspiral and after the merger but only if sufficiently strong . comparing waveforms for different magnetizations",
    "we have found that for @xmath2 , the overlap @xmath3 and is quite insensitive to the mass of the nss . only for unrealistically large magnetic fields ( @xmath105 ) , the overlap decreases noticeably , becoming at our resolutions @xmath106 for stars with baryon masses @xmath107 , respectively . since the magnetic fields in nss just prior to merger are expected to be rather small ( @xmath108 )  @xcite , we conclude that it is very unlikely that the present detectors will be able to measure the presence of magnetic fields during the inspiral .",
    "magnetic fields could be however detectable after the merger and hence in the part of the spectrum at frequencies @xmath109 [ _ cf .",
    "_  spectra in  @xcite ] .",
    "another important result discussed here is the evidence that a kh instability develops during the merger , leading to the exponential growth of a toroidal magnetic field , the strength of which becomes comparable with the poloidal one .",
    "this additional magnetic field can modify the structure of the hmns and decrease the overlap after the merger .",
    "finally , we have provided concrete evidence that high - order methods are _ essential _ to draw robust conclusions and that instead lower - order methods incorrectly suggest that magnetic fields have no influence at all .",
