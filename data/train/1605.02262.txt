    "a lot of research has been done in astrophysics to understand the formation of massive stars and the feedback to their surrounding ism ( e.g. zinnecker et al . 2007 ;",
    "deharveng et al .",
    "2010 , and references therein )",
    ". however , many questions are still unclear .",
    "multi - wavelength observations are essential to deeply understand how the triggered star formation processes impact on the massive star formation process .",
    "young massive stars tend to form in clusters or groups .",
    "the formation of massive stars has an immense impact on their environment through ionizing radiation , heating of dust and expansions of their hii regions .",
    "these processes may trigger next generation of star formation by compressing neighboring molecular clouds to the point of gravitational instability .",
    "massive stars also have powerful winds which sweep up the surrounding gas , creating interstellar bubbles ( e.g. weaver et al .",
    "1977 ; churchwell et al .",
    "2006 ) . in the case of ob associations ,",
    "the released intense ultraviolet radiation may ionize the surrounding ism within tens of parsecs .",
    "a number of observations demonstrate hii regions can strongly affect star formation nearby .",
    "sugitani et al . (",
    "1989 ) showed the ratios of luminosity of the protostar to core mass in bright - rimmed clouds are much higher than those in dark globules .",
    "dobashi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) also showed that protostars associated with hii regions are more luminous than those in molecular clouds away from them , indicating hii regions favour massive stars or cluster formation in neighboring molecular clouds .",
    "moreover , in the hii region of w5 , karr and martin ( 2003 ) found the number of star - formation events per unit co covering area within the influence zone is 4.8 higher than outside .",
    "however , the role of expanding hii regions in triggering star formation is still poorly understood .",
    "for example , dale et al . ( 2007a , b ) argue that the main effect of an expanding hii region may simply be to expose stars that would have formed anyway .",
    "several mechanisms by which massive stars can affect the subsequent star formation in an hii region have been proposed .",
    "two of the most studied processes are known as `` radiatively driven implosion '' ( rdi ) ( e.g. lefloch & lazareff 1994 ; miao et al.2006 ; miao et al .",
    "2009 ) and `` collect and collapse '' ( c&c ) ( e.g. elmegreen & lada 1977 ; osterbrock 1989 ) . according to the model of `` rdi '' , the expanding ionization fronts caused by the uv radiations impact into pre - existing molecular clouds , leading to the formation of a cometary globule , where new stars may finally be born ( larosa 1983 ) .",
    "the `` c&c '' model invokes the standard picture of a slow moving d type ionization front with associated shock front that precedes the ionization front ( osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "dense gas may pile up between the two fronts . on a long time",
    "the compressed shocked layer becomes gravitationally unstable and then star formation will take place inside .",
    "observational evidence of both processes has been proposed in a number of hii regions ( e.g. deharveng & zavagno 2008 ; cichowolski et al .",
    "2009 ; paron et al .",
    "2011 ) . in this paper",
    ", we made a multi - wavelength study of sh2 - 163 to find out whether second - generation clusters are forming around .",
    "we also discussed the physical mechanisms which may trigger star formation in this region .",

    "the distance to sh2 - 163 has been estimated by several authors , using different methods .",
    "co observations by blitz et al .",
    "( 1982 ) shows it has a velocity of -44.9 @xmath2 3.8 km / s ( the local standard of rest velocity ) , corresponding to a kinematic distance of 2.3 @xmath2 0.7 kpc ( brand & blitz 1993 ) .",
    "a spectrophotometric distance of 2.7 @xmath2 0.9 kpc was derived by georgelin ( 1975 ) . according to russeil et al .",

    ", we found outflow activities driven by young star(s ) still deeply embedded .",
    "3.using 2mass photometry , we searched for embedded yso candidates in this region .",
    "the very good relations between co emission , infrared shell and ysos suggest that it is probably a triggered star formation region by the expansion of sh2 - 163 .",
    "we discard the so - called `` rdi '' and `` c&c '' processes taking place in sh2 - 163 , and propose another possibility that the shocked expanding layer , prior to the beginning of the instability , collides with these pre - existing molecular clouds ( a and b ) .",
    "star formation would take place at the interface between the layer and the cloud clumps .",

    "<S> , we found new outflow activities and massive star(s ) are forming inside . using 2mass photometry </S>",
    "<S> , we tried to search for embedded young stellar object ( yso ) candidates in this region . </S>",
    "<S> the very good relations between co emission , infrared shell and ysos suggest that it is probably a triggered star formation region by the expansion of sh2 - 163 . </S>",
