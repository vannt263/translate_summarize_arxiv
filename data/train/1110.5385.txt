    "identifying the functional importance of species is a fundamental step in describing community and ecosystem structure and function .",
    "it is essential for ecologists , conservation biologists , and resource managers to understand species relative importance so that they can make informed management decisions and effectively allocate limited conservation resources .",
    "rank - abundance curves @xcite are a classic tool used to describe the biodiversity and relative importance of species in a community .",
    "this approach generally assumes that the importance of the species is proportional to its abundance or biomass .",
    "alternative techniques include using functional measures like productivity in dominance ",
    "diversity curves @xcite , and more recent concepts such as network role equivalence @xcite , keystone species @xcite , ecosystem engineers @xcite , and more generally the concept of foundational species @xcite",
    ". however , quantifying the relative functional importance of species embedded in their communities remains a challenging problem . in this paper",
    ", we introduce a new approach to quantifying the relative functional importance of species in ecosystem networks termed _",
    "environ centrality_. while species importance can be defined in a variety of ways , here we specifically focus on their importance for energy  matter distribution in communities .",
    "while we focus on ecosystems , the methods are generally applicable to any complex system of conservative fluxes modeled as a network .",
    "one reason that the fundamental step of quantifying species functional importance has not been fully addressed is that indirect interactions complicate the assessment .",
    "organisms are embedded in an intricate web of interactions and it is this tangled network of relationships that enables indirect influences to become significant components of ecological and evolutionary interactions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , @xcite showed how invasive species can increase the prevalence and severity of disease in a community through trait - mediated indirect effects .",
    "trophic cascades are one type of trophic indirect effect that can have large and unexpected impacts on ecosystems @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite found that where wolf populations were extripated , mesopredator populations like coyotes were released from predator control .",
    "this then resulted in a four fold decrease in the survival rate of pronghorn fawns , a coyote prey item .",
    "thus , understanding the ecological and functional importance of species in their ecosystem requires understanding the full environment of direct and indirect influences .",
    "network models of ecosystems let ecologists quantify species importance and are a key tool for determining the importance of indirect influences that are distributed through these types of interactions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in these models , network _ nodes _ represent species , groups of species , or abiotic resource pools .",
    "although the nodes may be a species complex or non - living compartment of energy ",
    "matter , we generically refer to them as species throughout this paper for simplicity .",
    "links _ represent the flow of energy ",
    "matter from one node to another .",
    "these energy ",
    "matter flows can be created by several ecological processes including feeding , death , and excretion .",
    "this representation of complex ecosystem interactions lets ecologists apply mathematical and computational tools to learn more about the structure and function of ecosystems .",
    "these ecosystem networks can be represented by weighted and directed graphs so that a link not only implies a relationship between two nodes but it also indicates _ how much _ ( weighted ) energy ",
    "matter and _ from whom to whom _ ( directed ) the energy ",
    "matter is flowing .",
    "ecological network analyses ( ena ) are a collection of quantitative methods that systematically asses information from a full , complex network description .",
    "there are several specific implementations of this concept , such as ecopath @xcite , network environ analysis @xcite , econet @xcite , and netwrk @xcite .",
    "ena s throughflow analysis mathematically partitions ecosystem energy ",
    "matter flow across boundary , direct , and indirect paths in the network @xcite .",
    "this approach has been applied to analyze the structure and function of ecosystems .",
    "for example , @xcite used the technique to characterize mineral cycling in the hubbard brook ecosystem .",
    "more recently , @xcite and @xcite investigated nitrogen cycling in the neuse river estuary , and @xcite investigated the urban water metabolic system of beijing .",
    "ena lets scientist study the efferent and afferent holistic environments of species within a system boundary , which patten termed environs @xcite .",
    "based on the development and application of ena , systems ecologists have hypothesized that indirect energy  matter flows tend to dominate direct flows in ecosystems @xcite .",
    "@xcite found support for this hypothesis in large ecosystem models generated from a community assembly type algorithm , @xcite found supporting evidence for the hypothesis in 16 seasonal nitrogen cycling models for the neuse river estuary , and @xcite found general support for the hypothesis in 50 empirically - based trophic ecosystem models . a consequence of these large indirect energy ",
    "matter flows is that resources tend to be more evenly distributed in the systems @xcite . given this tendency , we hypothesized that indirect effects tend to homogenize the relative importance of the species , decreasing the relative influence any single species has on ecosystem functioning .",
    "this paper has three main objectives .",
    "first , we introduce a new metric of functional importance based on the throughflow analysis of ena and centrality concepts from social science .",
    "we contrast this measure with other existing centrality indexes to demonstrate its utility and uniqueness .",
    "second , we use this measure to characterize the relative importance of species in 50 trophic ecosystem models .",
    "third , we test two hypotheses regarding the functional organization of ecosystems .",
    "based on previous community analysis , we first hypothesized that there will tend to be a `` concentration of dominants '' or functionally more important species and a `` long tail '' of species with a lower and more similar importance .",
    "we expected that the ecosystem dominants would be compartments like detritus , particulate organic matter , and bacteria because of their critical role in recirculating energy ",
    "matter and connecting the green and brown food webs @xcite .",
    "we further tested the hypothesis that indirect effects tend to homogenize the relative importance of species .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the centrality concept and describe its use and diversity .",
    "we then describe the ena throughflow analysis that we use and introduce the environ centrality measure .",
    "section 4 describes our analytical approach to testing our hypotheses and section 5 describes our results .",
    "we conclude the paper by putting these results into a broader context .",
    "centrality is a concept used by scientists studying complex systems that was initially developed by social scientists to quantify the importance of individuals in network models @xcite .",
    "metrics based on this concept indicate how a node s position in the network contributes to its structural or functional importance .",
    "there are multiple centrality metrics with varying characteristics @xcite , but many tend to be well correlated @xcite . despite this correlation , differences between the measures can be useful .",
    "for example , degree centrality is based on the number of network edges directly touching a node and describes the local or proximate importance of the node .",
    "in contrast , eigenvector centrality describes the stable distribution of pathways ( i.e. at long pathways ) passing through the nodes , which provides a more global or whole network understanding of the nodes relative importance .",
    "these different measures have been well described in the literature , so here we focus on the ecological relevance of selected centrality measures .",
    "there are several approaches to quantitatively describing ecosystem networks @xcite .",
    "several metrics commonly used to describe food webs such as link density and connectance @xcite are what @xcite call group level indicators of centrality .",
    "link density is the average node degree in the network .",
    "connectance is link density proportional to the size of the network .",
    "degree centrality , and thus link density and connectance , is a _ local _ centrality metric because it only considers the immediately adjacent neighborhood of connected nodes .",
    "local centrality metrics may be a useful starting point for describing a food web , but they may not be the best descriptors of the organism s importance in energy ",
    "matter transference because they assume the influence is restricted to a local neighborhood .",
    "thus , they neglect the important indirect influences . from a trophic point of view , indirect effects become important in part because energy ",
    "matter is passed from one organism to another and may ultimately reenter the same organism through nutrient cycling , creating a well connected web of interactions @xcite .",
    "centrality metrics that incorporate indirect influences include betweenness centrality @xcite , eigenvector centrality @xcite , and weighted topological importance @xcite .",
    "these centrality metrics are more appropriate for many ecological applications than those that only consider direct influences , but still have important limitations .",
    "betweenness centrality considers the possible gatekeeper role that some nodes may play in the transfer of information , energy , and matter from two more distinct groups .",
    "while this metric can be useful , its focused on a particular type of bridging importance @xcite and was not intended to provide a more general metric of the importance of a node . in trophic or biogeochemical network models , eigenvector centrality effectively quantifies the equilibrium distribution of energy  matter flowing through the nodes , thus considering the direct and indirect interactions . however , there are two potential problems with this measure for ecological networks .",
    "first , it ignores the contribution of the initial transient effects that maybe important in some contexts , especially systems in which the strength of interaction decreases rapidly with path length like ecosystems @xcite .",
    "second , it only considers the dominant eigenvector , which depending on the structure of the network may not be an adequate approximation of the transfer dynamics @xcite .",
    "weighted topological importance quantifies the effect a species has on others in a community , which is great for understanding competition but does not provide information on how species contribute to global network properties such as total energy ",
    "matter throughflow . to address these limitations ,",
    "we introduce _ environ centrality _ , which uses weighted information , integrates direct and indirect effects , describes how species contribute to global network measures , and captures the transient dynamics as well as the equilibrium effects .",
    "as comprehensive summaries of ena methodology exist @xcite , here we focus on the components of ena necessary to calculate the centrality of species in ecosystem network models .",
    "we used the network environ analysis matlab@xmath0 function @xcite to implement these analyses .",
    "let a network model with @xmath1 nodes be represented by a matrix , @xmath2 , which defines the quantity of energy  matter being transferred from node @xmath3 to node @xmath4 .",
    "the structural component of @xmath5 is the adjacency matrix , @xmath6 , in which a 1 indicates a direct connection from @xmath3 to @xmath4 and 0 indicates none .",
    "matter entering the system at node @xmath4 is denoted by @xmath7 , whereas energy ",
    "matter leaving the system at node @xmath3 is @xmath8 .",
    "ena uses this system data to determine several ecosystem properties .",
    "first , the total flow through a node is defined as throughflow , which can be input @xmath9 or output @xmath10 oriented .",
    "ena typically assumes that the networks are at steady state ( e.g. , mass - balanced ) so @xmath11 .",
    "second , we calculate the direct flow intensity matrix @xmath12 .",
    "we focus on the output oriented direct flow intensity matrix , which is calculated as @xmath13",
    ". elements of @xmath12 are unitless and represent the direct flow intensity from node @xmath3 to node @xmath4 .",
    "third , raising @xmath12 to a power @xmath14 , gives the flow intensity between two compartments over all paths of length @xmath14 .",
    "the sum of flow intensities over all pathways in a network is defined as the integral flow matrix @xmath15 , which is    @xmath16    @xmath15 quantifies the intensity of output oriented throughflow from @xmath3 to @xmath4 over all pathways in the network . since ecological systems are thermodynamically open , the energy ",
    "matter must dissipate as path length increases causing the sum of flow intensities over all pathways to converge .",
    "thus , we can use the identity @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the identity matrix , to find the exact values of @xmath15 .",
    "multiplying the integral matrix @xmath15 by the input vector @xmath19 returns the output oriented node throughflow @xmath20 .",
    "this equation ensures that equation ( [ eq : n ] ) is a true partition of flow and that the flow elements are not double counted .",
    "total system throughflow ( @xmath21 ) is the sum of node throughflows and is a global measure of the total network activity or size of the system .",
    "thus , the integral matrix shows how @xmath22 is generated by species in an ecological network and incorporates energy ",
    "matter flux over all indirect pathways .",
    "environ centrality is calculated from the integral flow matrix and quantifies the relative importance of species in creating total system activity .",
    "environ centrality is a measure based on the ena output - oriented integral flow matrix , @xmath15 .",
    "we introduce three related environ centrality measures : input ( @xmath23 ) , output ( @xmath24 ) , and an average of the two ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "these are calculated as follows :    @xmath26    @xmath23 and @xmath24 indicate the relative importance of species in generating ecosystem activity from an input or output direction , respectively .",
    "@xmath25 determines the relative importance of species in ecosystem models by averaging the input and output importance .",
    "thus , @xmath25 quantifies the relative contribution of a node to the energy ",
    "matter exchange within a system .",
    "it is a global centrality measure of the functional importance of species because it incorporates direct and indirect pathways , weighting pathways by the amount of energy ",
    "matter flux intensity passing through a node .",
    "further , it captures the transient dynamics as well as the equilibrium dynamics and describes how a species contributes to total system activity .",
    "[ fig : rank ] shows an example rank - order distribution of @xmath25 for the georges bank ecosystem @xcite .",
    "ena is an input  output analysis in which it is possible to calculate output oriented and input oriented integral flow intensities @xcite .",
    "thus , it is possible to calculate the @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 for both of these orientations .",
    "the interpretation of output and input oriented integral flow intensities differ .",
    "the output orientation looks forward in time and follows the direction of the network arrows .",
    "the input orientation looks backward through the network , against the arrow directions , to see where the flow has come from .",
    "both orientations can be analytically useful independently and when jointly considered @xcite .",
    "as the purpose of this paper is to introduce environ centrality and illustrate its ecological significance , only the output oriented case is analyzed for simplicity .",
    "we expect the input oriented results to be similar , although the interpretation will differ .",
    "in this section we describe our experimental design to test our hypotheses .",
    "we first characterize the set of 50 empirically based ecosystem models we analyzed .",
    "we then explain our evaluation of the utility and uniqueness of @xmath27 .",
    "finally , we describe our approach for determining species dominance and the centrality homogenization in 50 ecosystem networks .",
    "we calculated @xmath25 for 50 empirically - based network models of ecosystem energy ",
    "matter flows ( table  [ tab : models ] ) .",
    "@xcite first assembled this data set to test the distinct systems ecology resource homogenization hypothesis .",
    "the collection is available from http://people.uncw.edu/borretts/research.html .",
    "models were selected that spanned a range of sizes from smaller , highly aggregated systems comprising 4 nodes to larger , less aggregated systems comprising 125 nodes .",
    "each network model traces trophic and non - trophic energy ",
    "matter transactions such as feeding , excretion , mortality , immigration and emigration and together represent 35 distinct ecosystems . to avoid a selection bias ,",
    "all models discovered in the literature that were created to model a specific ecosystem and that included empirical data were included in the data set ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details ) . to meet the ena steady - state assumption ,",
    "we balanced 15 of the 50 models using the avg2 algorithm , which @xcite demonstrated minimized balancing bias .      given the environ centrality metric , our first step was to evaluate its sensitivity and demonstrate its novelty .",
    "to illustrate its sensitivity , we compared @xmath25 values for four realizations of a hypothetical ecosystem flow network ( fig .",
    "[ fig : toy ] ) .",
    "the four realizations vary in their distribution of flow amongst the five internal direct pathways .",
    "this is evident in the direct flow intensity matrices , @xmath12 , and the subsequent integral flow matrices , @xmath15 .",
    "the direct flow intensity values in the second realization are 10% of those in the first , which is a universal extensive change .",
    "the distribution of flow intensities is the same , but in the second realization the total magnitude is less .",
    "realizations three and four have equal total flow intensities , but differ in how it is distributed .",
    "thus , this is an example of an intensive change .",
    "together , these realizations demonstrate @xmath25 s ability to capture both intensive and extensive network changes .",
    "in addition to @xmath25 , we also examined the average eigenvector centrality @xmath28 ( table  [ tab : cent ] ) since these were likely to be the most similar centrality measures .    to show @xmath25 s uniqueness",
    ", we compared its results in two ecosystem models to five commonly used centrality metrics : degree centrality ( @xmath29 ) , weighted degree centrality ( @xmath30 ) , weighted topological importance ( @xmath31 ) , and betweenness centrality ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the oyster reef and chesapeake bay models were selected as case studies to demonstrate the distributions of these five centrality metrics in empirical network models ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] ) .",
    "we calculated all metrics using common formulations ( table  [ tab : cent ] ) and then normalized each set of scores by its sum ( _ sensu _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , creating proportions to facilitate comparisons among the five metrics .",
    "in addition to the comparisons in fig .  [",
    "fig : comp ] , we compared @xmath25 and @xmath28 for four network models ; the oyster reef , chesapeak bay , bothnian bay , and northern benguela . finally , we calculated the spearman rank correlation of the @xmath25 and @xmath28 in the 50 empirically based ecosystem models listed in table  [ tab : models ] .",
    "we focus on these two centrality measures because they are most likely to be similar because they are both global pathway centralities .",
    "to address our hypothesis regarding the relative importance of species in ecosystems , we used the coefficient of variation ( @xmath33 ) to characterize the evenness of the @xmath25 distribution and to identify dominant species in 50 ecosystem models .",
    "although there are multiple methods for quantifying variation , we chose @xmath33 because it is a non - dimensional measure normalized to the mean values .",
    "this lets us compare the relative variation across systems , even if they differ in the number of species or @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , @xmath33 is sensitive to distribution skew @xcite , which we use to our advantage to identify dominant species .",
    "we considered ecosystems with a @xmath33 less than unity ( 1 ) to be low variance . to identify the dominant species",
    ", we ranked species according to their @xmath25 scores and calculated the @xmath33 for the entire community .",
    "we then progressively removed the highest ranking species until the @xmath33 of the remaining community @xmath25 was less than or equal to @xmath34 .",
    "a @xmath33 value of 0.5 is low enough to identify dominant species without being so low as to claim all species are dominant",
    ". it also identifies which species are responsible for the highest proportion of the variation in @xmath27 .",
    "all species removed before reaching the @xmath33 threshold are classified as dominant species with respect to the ecosystem flux of energy ",
    "thus , this approach determines both the evenness of non - dominant species , and identifies the dominant species .",
    "our final hypothesis was that indirect flows would homogenize the relative importance of species in generating @xmath22 .",
    "we addressed this hypothesis by comparing the relative importance of species in the direct flows to those of the integral flows . recall that equation",
    "[ eq : n ] calculates the integral flow intensity matrix @xmath15 that combines flow intensity over all boundary ( @xmath35 ) , direct ( @xmath36 ) , and indirect pathways ( @xmath37 ) . to find the relative importance of species from the perspective of the direct flows alone , we substituted @xmath12 for @xmath15 in equation  [ eq : ec ] to calculate _",
    "direct _ average environ centrality ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "we then compared @xmath38 to the integral average environ centrality ( @xmath25 ) to test the homogenizing effect of indirect relationships on @xmath25 .",
    "as the integral matrix includes boundary , direct , and indirect flow intensities , it is possible that observed homogenization could be caused by the boundary input as well as the indirect flows . to isolate the effect of the indirect flows , we also compared the @xmath38 to the @xmath25 calculated on @xmath39 instead of @xmath15 .",
    "homogenization of species importance was quantified by comparing the @xmath33 of @xmath38 and the @xmath33 of @xmath25 .",
    "we created a ratio of the two , @xmath40 , such that when the ratio is greater than unity ( 1 ) it indicates that the @xmath25 is more evenly distributed than @xmath38 .",
    "ratio values greater than unity indicate that indirect effects homogenize the importance of species in generating ecosystem activity .",
    "to establish the sensitivity of @xmath25 to both intensive and extensive changes , we applied it to four realizations of the hypothetical ecosystem model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : toy ] .",
    "the @xmath25 distributions for the realizations are clearly different ( fig .",
    "[ fig : toy]d ) . in the first realization ,",
    "the detritus box was more important and the importance of the primary producer was diminished . in the second realization in which the direct flow intensities were reduced by 90% ,",
    "the @xmath25 values are much more similar .",
    "this is because the drop in flow intensities is then transmitted through the longer pathways , effectively discounting them .",
    "however , there is no difference between the @xmath28 centrality distributions between realization one and two , demonstrating that eigenvector centrality is not sensitive to this extensive change .",
    "realizations three and four maintained the total magnitude of the network but have different distributions , which is an intensive change .",
    "the @xmath25 and @xmath28 distributions between realization three and four are different , demonstrating that both metrics are sensitive to these intensive changes . in the third realization ,",
    "one flux to the consumer compartment increased which caused it to become the second most central compartment .",
    "the detritus compartment also responded to the change , increasing its centrality from 0.26 to 0.30 . for the fourth realization ,",
    "the flux from detritivore to detritus increased , causing detritus to maintain its centrality from the previous realization at 0.30 and detritivores to increase its centrality to 0.30 as well .",
    "these four cases show that @xmath25 is sensitive enough to capture important differences between the model flow realizations , and specifically demonstrates its ability to capture both intensive and extensive changes to direct energy  matter flows .",
    "the comparison of the four centrality metrics to @xmath25 in the oyster reef and chesapeake bay ecosystem models ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] ) shows the different structural and functional importance of the species within each network and illustrates the unique perspective of @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath29 highlights which species were most connected within the network topology ( unweighted ) , yet was not always a predictor of which species would be most important in generating @xmath22 . there were several disparities between @xmath29 and @xmath25 which show that being the most connected does not necessarily result in being a key species in generating @xmath22 .",
    "for example , the suspended particulate nutrient node from the chesapeake bay model has a greatly reduced ranking in @xmath25 despite having the second largest @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 had similar mismatches with @xmath25 , and demonstrates that high or low magnitudes of direct flows are not always indicative of overall importance in generating ecosystem activity . in both models , @xmath31 consistently placed primary producers and herbivores ( i.e. filter feeders , phytoplankton , and zooplankton ) as species with the highest effect on others , yet these species ranked low in @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath32 distribution was the most distinct centrality metric .",
    "average eigenvector centrality should be the most similar to average environ centrality because they are both global centrality measures related to pathways or energy  matter flow ; however , we see from fig .  [",
    "fig : toy ] that they can differ . fig .",
    "[ fig : comp2 ] further illustrates differences between @xmath28 and @xmath25 .",
    "it shows both types of centralities for four cases : the oyster reef and chesapeake bay models used in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] and the bothnian bay and northern benguela ecosystem models .",
    "the centralities indicate a difference of the rank - order importance of the nodes for all models except the oyster reef .",
    "for example , @xmath25 suggests that bacteria , dom , mesozooplankton , and microzooplankton have a larger functional importance in the bothnian bay ecosystem than is suggested by the eigenvector centrality ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comp2]b ) .",
    "in contrast , eigenvector centrality indicates a very dominant importance of meiofauna , sediment carbon , and macrofauna .",
    "the two centralities also show a different rank importance of the nodes in the northern benguela ecosystem model . from the @xmath25 perspective",
    ", poc has a dominant importance , while most of the other species have very similar centralities .",
    "variation in @xmath28 is larger in all models , including oyster reef where the rank importance are the same .",
    "one interesting difference is the diminished importance of seals suggested by @xmath28 for fig .",
    "[ fig : comp2]d )",
    ". additionally , @xmath28 ranks bacteria in sediment poc as more important than sediment particulate carbon in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp2]c while the @xmath25 values are nearly the same .    to generalize our analysis , we calculated the spearman rank correlation between @xmath25 and @xmath28 for the 50 ecosystem network models ( table  [ tab : models ] ) .",
    "these correlations ranged from 0.2 to 1 and had a median value of 0.92 . as we expected , this suggests that these two centrality measures are typically , but not always , similar .",
    "our case studies in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp2 ] highlight how these small correlation differences can be ecologically meaningful .",
    "rank @xmath25 curves provide a tool to visualize the relative importance of species ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rank ] ) .",
    "the @xmath25 distribution of the georges bank illustrates the tendency for a few nodes to have high @xmath25 with most having relatively lower and even @xmath25 values .",
    "@xmath25 variation in the ecosystem models we analyzed was generally low ( table  [ tab : dom ] ) .",
    "twelve of the models have a @xmath41 less than @xmath34 and 30 of the models have a @xmath41 between @xmath34 and unity .",
    "however , eight of the models exhibit more variability with cv values larger than unity . in the models with a cv larger than @xmath34 , no more than three dominant species had to be removed before the @xmath33 of the remaining species fell below @xmath34 ( table  [ tab : dom ] ) .",
    "the median number of dominants was two .",
    "as expected , detritus and detrital recyclers are predominantly responsible for generating @xmath22 in most ecosystems , with water flagellates being the only non - detrital or bacterial species to rank as dominant @xmath25 contributors .",
    "the second hypothesis was that sub - dominant species would have a more even distribution of importance . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rank ] , the first two species were considered dominant species and the @xmath33 score for the whole ecosystem was 0.68 . however , once the dominants were removed the @xmath33 score of the remaining species was @xmath42 suggesting less variation in the importance of the remaining species .",
    "table  [ tab : dom ] identifies the @xmath33 value of the entire community , as well as the community without the dominant species for all 50 ecosystem models .",
    "after the dominant species were removed , the @xmath25 scores were relatively even , with an average @xmath33 score of @xmath43 .",
    "this indicates that the standard deviation was only 38% the magnitude of the mean .",
    "all the networks support our hypothesis that the importance of sub - dominant species would be relatively even .      the comparison of direct and integral @xmath25 in the oyster reef model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gncomp ] ) illustrates how the relative importance of species in generating @xmath22 can become more similar when indirect flows are considered .",
    "[ fig : cv ] shows that this is a general trend as 49 of the 50 network models ( 98% ) exhibited less variation in @xmath25 when indirect flows were considered .",
    "the ems estuary was the only network to not meet our expectation .",
    "furthermore , when boundary effects were excluded from our analysis , 33 of 50 ecosystems ( 66% ) exhibited homogenized importance due to indirect effects alone .",
    "thus , indirect effects appear to homogenize the importance of species in ecosystems .",
    "our results make two ecologically significant contributions .",
    "first , @xmath25 is a novel way to quantify the relative functional importance of species or functional groups in an ecosystem with respect to the global energy ",
    "matter exchange of a network .",
    "it is sensitive to both extensive and intensive changes , and incorporates indirect effects . with this metric",
    ", we gain new insight into the distribution of species contribution to the total system activity .",
    "second , the results highlight another critical consequence of indirect interactions in ecosystems ; they tend to make species functional importance more similar . if this pattern holds generally , it has important implications for conservation biology which we discuss below .",
    "our results support the hypothesis that ecosystems are comprised of a few functionally dominant species and a larger set of species with relatively similar functional importance .",
    "the smaller @xmath33 values for the remaining community after the dominants are excluded demonstrate that the top ranked species are responsible for a majority of the variation in @xmath25 and that most species in ecosystems have relatively low and even centralities .",
    "this is further evidence for the general dominance ",
    "diversity community patterns initially described by @xcite .",
    "the second hypothesis this paper tested concerned the effect of indirect flows on the species environ centralities .",
    "our results support the hypothesis that indirect effects tend to even the functional importance of species",
    ". indirect flows alone homogenized the importance of species in 66% of the ecosystem networks analyzed .",
    "the empirical literature is rich with examples of indirect relationships driving ecosystem reactions @xcite and our theoretical analysis provides evidence for another important consequence of indirect effects .",
    "the ems estuary was the only network in which the integral centrality @xmath25 was not more even than the direct environ centrality @xmath44 .",
    "this could be because of the extreme dominant centrality of the sediment poc in this model . after removing sediment poc from the @xmath25 variation analysis ,",
    "the @xmath33 declined 70% which was one of the largest percent drops in variation .",
    "it was also one of the few ecosystems to have a @xmath41 that was greater than unity .",
    "collectively , our homogenization results support the trend towards whole ecosystem management for conservation biology .",
    "although a few species may have a dominant functional importance , most species are contributing in similar ways .",
    "this could be interpreted as suggesting that losing the non - dominant species would have less significant impacts on the system , but this misses a fundamental aspect of the results .",
    "the homogenization of the species centralities is a consequence of the indirect interactions that are distributed across the network of relationships .",
    "this depends on the existing species and their pattern of direct and indirect connections .",
    "thus these results show that preserving the intact network is critical to maintain current ecosystem total energy ",
    "matter throughflow .      our comparison of centrality metrics in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] highlights the differences and similarities between these five metrics . in the case of @xmath30 and @xmath31 ,",
    "both metrics are calculated from the same matrix @xmath5 , but differ by the anchoring metric ( i.e. sum of energy  matter entering a node versus total energy  matter flowing in the network ) and the length of the pathways considered .",
    "this may explain the similarities between @xmath30 and @xmath31 as seen in the oyster reef model .",
    "average eigenvector centrality should be the most similar to average environ centrality because they are both global centrality measures related to pathways or flow .",
    "however , our results show that these centrality measures can be quite different .",
    "the results of the hypothetical ecosystem model are most instructive ( fig .",
    "[ fig : toy ] ) . the first and second model realizations whose direct flow intensity distributions are the same have the same @xmath28 distributions .",
    "the large drop in direct transfer efficiencies does not affect the equilibrium distribution of flows , thus the eigenvector centralities remain the same .",
    "this is unlike @xmath25 which does respond to the drop in transfer efficiency because it captures the transient flow dynamics as well as the equilibrium distribution .",
    "this demonstrates the ability of @xmath25 to capture extensive changes that @xmath28 does not .",
    "both @xmath25 and @xmath28 capture differences between realizations three and four , demonstrating that both are able to capture intensive changes to direct energy  matter flow .",
    "although @xmath25 and @xmath28 are well correlated , most centrality metrics tend to be well correlated @xcite , and small differences between metrics can be biologically important ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : comp2 ] ) .",
    "alternative centrality measures have different values .",
    "we do not expect one to be the universally correct analytical choice .",
    "if the goal is to understand the relative importance of nodes in generating the total system activity of a network model of conservative flows , the evidence presented here suggests that @xmath25 is a good choice .      despite the limitations of the set of ecosystem network models ( e.g. relatively few model authors , only 35 distinct ecosystems , some very small models @xmath45 , mass  balanced assumption ) , the consistency of the results suggests they are robust to model error . to verify the generality of these results ,",
    "this data set can be extended to include biogeochemically - based networks that may reflect different aspects of ecosystem organization @xcite as more models become available .",
    "our preliminary analysis suggest that these results may hold true for biogeochemically  based networks , but this remains a testable hypothesis .",
    "one important direction for future research is clarifying the relationship between alternative methods for quantifying the `` importance '' and `` effects '' species have on one another @xcite .",
    "for example , measure of distributed control among species in a network is calculated using the input and output oriented integral flow matrices .",
    "there are some clear conceptual differences , but since the underlying data and analytical goals are the same we expect there to be an interesting relationship between @xmath25 and distributed control",
    ". another possible comparison would be to calculate @xmath31 beyond path lengths of 10 to see how longer indirect relationships effect this centrality metric in an ena framework .",
    "this work makes three core contributions to ecology .",
    "first , we introduce a formal method called environ centrality to quantify the relative importance of species in generating ecosystem activity .",
    "this metric builds on the centrality concept from the social sciences and patten s environ concept , and can be considered in a manner similar to rank - abundance curves familiar to many ecologists .",
    "the main ecological advantages of environ centrality are that it is the only metric to date to include all direct and indirect effects of a weighted ecosystem network model , it is simple to calculate in the ena framework , and it should easily apply to network models of flow in other types of complex systems .",
    "further , it is sensitive to both extensive and intensive changes to direct flow intensities , and does not ignore the sometimes important transient dynamics like eigenvector centrality does .",
    "second , we applied environ centrality to find evidence that support the hypothesis that ecosystems are comprised of both a few functionally dominant species and a larger group of species with more similar importance .",
    "our results expose the central importance of detritus and decomposer species like bacteria and fungi in generating carbon throughflow activity in ecosystems .",
    "this result is not surprising , but it supports our claim that environ centrality is a useful ecological measure .",
    "third , this work shows that indirect effects tend to homogenize the functional importance of species .",
    "this is further evidence of the important consequences that different types of indirect effects can have in complex systems like ecosystems .",
    "this research and manuscript benefited form critiques by z.  long , a.stapleton , m.  freeze , a.  salas , d.  hines , and m.  lau .",
