    "ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions ( urhics ) enable the creation and study of superdense strongly interacting matter , possibly associated with the formation of novel phases where partons deconfine and chiral symmetry is restored  @xcite .",
    "one major finding by the experimental program at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory is the large azimuthal anisotropy of hadron transverse - momentum ( @xmath4 ) spectra in non - central nuclear collisions , the so - called elliptic flow  @xcite .",
    "it is quantified by the second harmonic coefficient , @xmath5 , in the fourier expansion of the azimuthal angle , @xmath6 , for the @xmath4-spectra of hadrons .",
    "experimental measurements suggest that the behavior of @xmath5 may be classified into three regimes . at high transverse momentum , @xmath7gev",
    ", the azimuthal anisotropy is believed to be due to the path - length dependence of high - energy partons as they traverse the hot medium and lose energy .",
    "we will not be concerned any further with this mechanism in the present work . at low transverse momentum , @xmath8gev , @xmath9 increases with @xmath4 essentially linearly but with a delayed onset for hadrons with increasing mass , giving rise to the so - called mass ordering of elliptic flow  @xcite .",
    "this regime is well described by hydrodynamic simulations and thus indicates a large degree of equilibration , encompassing more than 90% of the observed particles  @xcite . at intermediate transverse momenta",
    ", @xmath10gev@xmath11gev , @xmath5 saturates and exhibits a remarkable scaling between baryons and mesons  @xcite , @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the number of valence quarks contained in hadron @xmath14 . equation ( [ v2_pt_scaling ] ) ,",
    "also known as  constituent - quark number scaling \" ( cqns ) , has been successfully described in the framework of quark coalescence models , where quarks recombine into hadrons at the transition from partonic to hadronic matter  @xcite . in line with eq .",
    "( [ v2_pt_scaling ] ) , these models thus imply that the observed hadron elliptic flow can be reduced to a universal quark elliptic flow at hadronization .",
    "this assertion , however , requires several simplifying assumptions .",
    "first , interactions in the subsequent hadronic evolution ( between hadronization at @xmath15mev and kinetic freeze - out at @xmath16mev ) are neglected .",
    "furthermore , eq .  ( [ v2_pt_scaling ] ) can only be dervied in instantaneous quark coalescence models where energy conservation is violated and narrow hadron wave functions in momentum space are utilized .",
    "in addition , the underlying quark distribution functions are assumed to factorize in coordinate and momentum space , implying that the elliptic flow of the system is implemented point - by - point ( i.e. , locally ) , rather than through a space - dependent flow field which is a consequence of a collectively expanding source .",
    "the implementation of realistic space - momentum correlations into quark coalescence models has indeed been proved difficult  @xcite .",
    "finally , quark coalescence models typically do not comply with the principle of detailed balance , implying that the proper equilibrium limit can not be established .",
    "this hampers attempts to extend the description into the low-@xmath4 regime where thermalization is believed to prevail .",
    "this has become a more pressing issue once it was realized that cqns can be generalized to encompass both low and intermediate @xmath4 if @xmath9 is plotted versus transverse kinetic energy , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the hadron s transverse mass  @xcite . in this representation ,",
    "elliptic - flow data for all observed hadrons fall onto one universal curve for @xmath19 versus @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "progress on the above issues has been recently reported by reformulating the quark - coalescence process at hadronization in terms of resonant @xmath21 scattering ( @xmath22 : meson )  @xcite .",
    "implementing the underlying cross section into a boltzmann transport equation ( e.g. , in breit - wigner approximation ) not only guarantees energy - momentum conservation but also satisfies detailed balance and thus leads to the correct thermal - equilibrium limit .",
    "it has been verified  @xcite that the meson spectra resulting from the resonance recombination model ( rrm ) are compatible with cqns , eq .",
    "( [ v2_pt_scaling ] ) , in the factorized ( local ) approximation to @xmath5 .",
    "a further step has been taken in ref .",
    "@xcite where the rrm has been applied to more realistic quark distribution functions as generated by relativistic langevin simulations within an expanding qgp fireball  @xcite for semi - central au - au collisions at rhic .",
    "since the brownian - motion approximation underlying the langevin process is only reliable for relatively massive and/or high - momentum particles , @xmath23 , the results have been restricted to charm and strange quarks .",
    "under inclusion of the full space - momentum correlations imprinted on the quark distributions by the hydro - like flow fields of the expanding fireball , the elliptic flow of @xmath6 and @xmath24 mesons was found to exhibit cqns in @xmath25 from 0 to @xmath263gev , which encompasses both low and intermediate @xmath4 , i.e. , the quasi - thermal and kinetic regimes",
    ". however , several important questions remain , e.g. , the manifestation of cqns and @xmath25 scaling for bulk ( light ) particles in the low-@xmath4 ( thermal ) regime , the robustness and generality of the flow fields utilized in the fireball simulations or the role of reinteractions in the hadronic phase . a thorough understanding of these issues , in connection with a quantitative description of hadron data , is hoped to ultimately enable the extraction of quark distribution functions just prior to the conversion to hadronic degrees of freedom , and thus to quantitatively establish the presence of a collectively expanding partonic source in urhics .    in the present paper",
    "we conduct investigations of scaling properties of hadron spectra by focusing on the low-@xmath4 regime coupled with the assumption of complete kinetic equilibration .",
    "we will utilize the rrm to convert locally equilibrated quark distribution functions into hadron spectra using a blast - wave type quark source with realistic flow fields at the hadronization transition ( including space - momentum correlations characteristic of hydrodynamic simulations ) .",
    "contrary to earlier work  @xcite , we do not attempt to generate the flow fields from a dynamic evolution , but rather extract them from empirical fits to hadron @xmath4-spectra and elliptic flow .",
    "in fact , after verifying that resonance recombination converts collective , locally equilibrated quark distribution functions into equilibrium hadron distributions with identical ( space - momentum dependent ) collective properties , one can adopt the source parametrization at the hadron level and thus readily extend the description to baryons .",
    "for this part of the investigation we focus on multi - strange hadrons ( i.e. , hadrons containing at least 2 strange and/or anti - strange quarks ) which are believed to kinetically decouple close to the hadronization transition .",
    "this notion is supported by empirical blast - wave fits to rhic and sps data  @xcite , as well as by the putative absence of resonances that these hadrons could form in interactions with bulk particles such as pions , kaons or nucleons ( hadronic resonances drive the collective expansion of the hadronic phases in urhics ) .",
    "we refer to hadrons decoupling close to @xmath27 as  group - i \" particles , which are thus the prime candidates to infer properties of the quark phase just above the critical temperature . on the other hand , the most prominent bulk particles ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , etc . )",
    "are well - known to interact quasi - elastically via strong hadronic resonances , such as @xmath28(770 ) , @xmath29(892 ) and @xmath30(1232 ) , which renders their interactions operative until a kinetic freeze - out temperature , @xmath31 , which is significantly lower than the one of group - i particles , @xmath32 .",
    "we refer to hadrons decoupling at @xmath31 as  group - ii \" particles .",
    "clearly , a description of @xmath25 scaling in the low-@xmath4 regime would be incomplete ( to say the least ) without @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in an attempt to include these particles ,",
    "we adopt the simplest possible scenario of introducing a second source for group - ii particles by fitting their spectra and @xmath9 with a space - dependent elliptic flow field at @xmath31 .",
    "we then evaluate in how far such a minimalistic ( but in our opinion well - motivated ) sequential freeze - out can be compatible with cqns and @xmath25 scaling , and which mechanisms could be responsible for them . in doing",
    "so we also revisit the question of resonance feed - down contributions to the pion @xmath9 for which differing results seem to exist in previous works .",

    "an increase in @xmath72 leads to a rapid increase in @xmath5 at relatively large @xmath4 but to rather small changes at low @xmath4 . on the contrary ,",
    "increasing @xmath116 results in a more uniform increase of @xmath5 over a wide range of @xmath4 . as a result , a relatively large @xmath72 , combined with a relatively small eccentricity , i.e. , @xmath116 close to unity ,",
    "are favored in fitting the data .",
    "the rather tight correlation between those two parameters can be exhibited in pertinent contour plots indicating the  allowed regions \" for obtaining an acceptable fit to data given their error bars , see  fig .",
    "[ fig_contour ] .",
    "the central values of the contours for the two particle groups correspond to the values listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : rlfit ] .",
    "the contour for group - ii hadrons is tighter due to the larger number of data points for bulk particles .",
    "we first note that the contours clearly exclude each other corroborating the significant evolution that the collective flow field is undergoing in the hadronic phase .",
    "more specifically , the anisotropy parameter @xmath116 for group - ii particles is smaller than for group - i , which is in line with the general expectation that the fireball becomes more spherical in the expansion .",
    "however , the flow anisotropy @xmath72 extracted from the rl blast - wave fits favors a decrease from hadronization ( group - i ) to kinetic decoupling of the bulk ( group - ii ) .",
    "this is contrary to the expectation from hydrodynamic expansion that @xmath119 should increase if the in - plane acceleration is always larger than the out - of - plane acceleration ( @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the surface - flow rapidities along the @xmath122- and @xmath123-direction , respectively ; recall eq .",
    "( [ transverse_rapidity ] ) ) .",
    "we can not resolve this question within the present blast - wave model .",
    "a full hydrodynamic simulation could give more insight , possibly requiring substantial viscosity effects in the later stages of the hadronic evolution .",
    "to summarize this and the previous section , we have produced a space - dependent parameterization of anisotropic flow fields which , when implemented into a rather simple thermal blast - wave description of locally equilibrated matter , provides a good overall fit to a large body of hadron data in semi - central au - au data in the low-@xmath4 regime . as a key ingredient",
    "we have introduced the well established concept of sequential freeze - out including just two groups but with clearly distinct flow fields .",
    "a signature result of ideal hydrodynamical simulations of urhics is the mass splitting of the hadron @xmath9 when plotted as a function of hadron @xmath4 , with a larger @xmath9 for the lighter particles at a given @xmath4 . on the other hand , if the hydrodynamic results for the hadron @xmath9 are plotted versus @xmath25 ( at a given freeze - out temperature ) , the splitting nearly vanishes , but not entirely .",
    "in fact , a small reverse mass ordering of @xmath9 is found instead , as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite . in other words ,",
    "the hydro - induced mass splitting of @xmath5 between light and heavy particles is not large enough to render their @xmath126 curves degenerate .",
    "the sequential freeze - out picture advocated above may hold an explanation to this apparent discrepancy between hydrodynamic freeze - out ( at fixed temperature ) and experimental data ( which exhibit  perfect \" @xmath25 scaling ) : random thermal motion tends to isotropize @xmath4 distributions and thus counteracts (  dilutes \" ) the collective motion in producing nonzero @xmath9 .",
    "thus one should expect that a gap in freeze - out temperatures between , say , ( light ) pions and ( heavy ) @xmath95 baryons increases the mass splitting in a @xmath5 plot ( the thermal motion of pions is suppressed at lower temperatures ) , just enough to produce degeneracy in a @xmath126 representation .",
    "this appears to be a conspiracy of circumstances that leads to the empirically observed @xmath25-scaling .",
    "however , the underlying mechanism ( largely different hadronic rescattering cross sections ) is general in the sense that it applies to different centralities , system sizes and even collision energies , presumably coupled with a rather general ( local ) freeze - out criterion .",
    "it therefore could be a candidate for the origin of the widely observed @xmath25 scaling . in the following , we quantitatively test this idea by analyzing the scaling properties within our sequential freezeout 2-source ansatz .    - and @xmath13-scaling of @xmath9 for different hadrons obtained within the sequential freeze - out scenario with blast - wave parameters given in table [ tab : rlfit ] .",
    "the result of an slightly later freeze - out for pions at temperature 100 mev is also shown . ]    with the rl flow - field parameterizations and freeze - out temperatures for the two sources of group - i and group - ii particles summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : rlfit ] we proceed to display the @xmath13-scaled hadron-@xmath9 as a function of the @xmath13-scaled hadron-@xmath25 in fig .  [ fig_ket - scal ] .",
    "we find that all the hadrons-@xmath9 curves follow a generic scaling very well ( with slights deviations for the pions , on which we comment below ) , very similar to experiment .",
    "this agreement is , of course , not unexpected given that our results follow from fits to data , together with the notion that the data satisfy the scaling in the first place ( or even led to its discovery ) .",
    "the nontrivial insight here is that our  minimalistic \" approach of a sequential freeze - out scenario coupled with a rather simple parameterization of an anisotropic collective flow field , is sufficient to establish the scaling .",
    "we also recall that @xmath13-scaling in the equilibrated low-@xmath4 region is not a direct consequence of quark recombination , at least not for group - ii particles . to better exhibit the significance of the sequential freeze - out we compare in fig .",

    "one finds a considerable breaking of both @xmath25- and @xmath13-scaling . for the heavy particles , the increase in collective flow at the low freeze - out temperature results in an appreciable depletion of their @xmath9 at low @xmath25 ( mass ordering effect ) , thus spoiling their compatibility with scaling . on the other hand , for pion and kaon freeze - out at higher temperature the increased thermal motion in the local rest frame dilutes the collective elliptic flow considerably and suppresses their @xmath9 below the scaling curve especially toward higher @xmath25 .",
    "-scaling behavior of hadron-@xmath9 extracted from fig .",
    "[ fig_ket - scal ] ( thick solid line ) to results for interchanging the freeze - out configurations for group - i and group - ii particles .",
    "specifically , the @xmath95 baryon ( dash - dotted line ) is frozen out from the late source at @xmath127mev , while pions ( dotted line ) and kaons ( dashed line ) are frozen out from the early source at @xmath128mev ( source parameters as quoted in tab .",

    "[ fig_ket - scal ] .",
    "one may wonder whether feed - down corrections from heavier particles ( @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , etc . )",
    "could improve the situation .",
    "this question is addressed in detail in appendix  [ app_feeddown ] , with the finding that the combined effect of the decay pions increases the pion @xmath9 at @xmath133gev only a little ( by a few percent ) .",
    "it turns out , however , that a slight decrease of the pion freeze - out temperature from 110mev to , e.g. , 100mev increases the pion @xmath9 preferentially at higher @xmath25 , resulting in good agreement with the general scaling curve . in doing",
    "so we have not performed a possibly small re - adjustment of the flow parameters to attempt a more quantitative conclusion .",
    "the key mechanism is again a further suppression of the random thermal motion of the pions , thus augmenting the relative importance of the collective motion .",
    "a 5 - 10mev smaller freeze - out temperature is certainly compatible with experimental data , and also not unreasonable from the theoretical point of view .",
    "pions have large resonant cross sections on all major particle types of the bulk ( pion , kaon and nucleon ) , and their mass being the smallest makes it plausible that their momentum spectra are frozen the latest ( mass ordering of thermal relaxation times ) .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the scaling properties of hadron elliptic flow in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions , which have received considerable attention since the experimental data suggest the existence of a universal behavior possibly related to a collectively expanding partonic source .",
    "we have focused our investigations on the low-@xmath4 regime ( @xmath8gev ) where rhic data ( and hydrodynamic analysis thereof ) support the assumption of a locally equilibrated medium .    in the first part of this work",
    "we have pursued the earlier idea that hadronization of the putative partonic system at rhic proceeds through coalescence of quarks and antiquarks .",
    "its implementation in the thermal regime requires a recombination model which obeys 4-momentum conservation and detailed balance to encode the correct equilibrium limit . the resonance recombination model ( rrm )",
    "satisfies these requirements .",
    "the flow field has been modeled by a blast - wave ansatz with azimuthal asymmetries which give rise to space - momentum correlations characteristic for a collectively expanding source .",
    "using rrm we have shown that an expanding parton source converts into hadron spectra with the same collective source properties , which , to our knowledge , has not been achieved in existing models of quark coalescence .",
    "we have utilized this connection to extract quark distributions just above the critical temperature for au - au collisions at rhic from measured @xmath4 spectra and elliptic flow of multi - strange hadrons which are believed to undergo negligible final - state interactions in the hadronic phase ( group - i particles ) .",
    "bulk particles with large hadronic cross sections ( e.g. , pion , kaons and nucleons ) can not be approximated by decoupling at the hadronization transition .",
    "we have included these particles ( group - ii ) in our analysis by constructing another flow field at the typical kinetic freeze - out temperature of 110  mev , and fitting the blast - wave parameters to their @xmath4 spectra and elliptic flow .",
    "group - ii hadrons are therefore not really sensitive to quark recombination . however , we find that the sequential freeze - out picture with just two sources is well compatible with the empirically observed kinetic - energy and constituent - quark number scaling ( where the latter is not directly linked to recombination ) .",
    "the sequential freeze - out naturally corrects for a slight breaking of @xmath25 scaling present in a hydrodynamic flow description for a uniform freeze - out .",
    "in particular , a smaller temperature is instrumental in suppressing the random thermal motion of the light pions and in this way bring up their @xmath9 toward the universal curve . in the thermal regime ,",
    "cqns of elliptic flow simply follows from the universal _ linear _ curve resulting from @xmath25 scaling ( i.e. , it is not directly linked to recombination ) .",
    "an important task of future work will be an extension of our studies to the intermediate-@xmath4 region . here",
    ", the onset of the kinetic regime occurs and thus off - equilibrium effects become important .",
    "while this increases the sensitivity to quark degrees of freedom , it also requires a more detailed knowledge of the reinteractions of particles , both in the qgp and hadronic phase .",
    "initial studies using langevin simulations for strange and heavy quarks have been reported  @xcite , but the scaling properties found there clearly require a deeper understanding , including the effects of baryon formation and a more microscopic description of the elastic ( as well as radiative ) interactions in the qgp and hadronic matter .",

    "the decay pions generally have steeper @xmath4-spectra than directly produced pions , except for pions from @xmath28 decays , similar to the observations made in refs .",

    "the phase - space also affects the @xmath9 of decay pions .",
    "the momenta of pions from resonances with large @xmath42 values ( like the @xmath28 ) tend to dilute the @xmath9 more due to the random orientation of the decay momentum , most notably at low momenta ( where the decay momentum in the parent s rest frame is comparable to the parent momentum ) . on the other hand , pions from resonances with small @xmath42 values ( like the @xmath30 )",
    "are essentially aligned with the parent and thus preserve the elliptic flow of the parent . for those pions ,",
    "the @xmath9 could be larger than that of the parent at the same @xmath4 , since the momentum of the resonance is shared by several daughters .",
    "however , since the dominant source of secondary pions are @xmath28 decays , the total pion-@xmath9 might not be much affected by resonance decays .",
