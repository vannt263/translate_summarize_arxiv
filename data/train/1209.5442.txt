    "the dichotomy of color , star - formation rate , morphology , etc .  between spirals and early - type galaxies ( etgs ) was established nearly a century ago , and has been highly refined over the past decade ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "despite long - standing empirical measurements , the physical processes that divide the two populations are still uncertain . the main challenge is to identify the mechanism(s ) that quench star - formation ( sf ) and that inhibited it over the past @xmath6gyr .",
    "dramatically different scenarios have been proposed for how star formation is quenched .",
    "ejective feedback is generally caused by the galaxy itself , and includes super winds that expel gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or more general heating and stripping of the gas @xcite , as well as mergers .",
    "conversely , preventative feedback , such as shock - heating of the gas prior to its accretion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or the disruption of in - falling clouds and their diffusion into the galaxy s gaseous halo @xcite , are consequences of etgs living in massive halos .",
    "[ fig1 ]    the paradigm of ` red and dead ' galaxies as quiescent , passively evolving stellar systems is being reconsidered in light of findings that a non - negligible fraction of them contain gas and dust , and a subset have experienced recent sf ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is also a high incidence of field etgs with molecular gas ( 22% , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath0  gas ( 40% , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ionized gas ( 73% , * ? ? ?",
    "the gas masses are often comparable to those of spirals in both atomic and molecular phases , with @xmath7 m@xmath8 @xcite and @xmath9 m@xmath8 ( figure  6 of * ? ? ?",
    "the corresponding sfrs reach up to a few @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , most etgs are quenched , and remain so .",
    "these observations raise a new series of challenges : what is the source of the interstellar gas ? on what time scale(s ) did it arrive ? given this reservoir of cool gas , why does the sfr remain low ?",
    "gas entering etgs from their large - scale surroundings must pass through their circumgalactic medium ( cgm ) , where it is detectable with sensitive uv absorption - line tracers ( limiting column density @xmath11 ) .",
    "quasar absorption line studies have attempted to link @xmath0  absorption ( generally @xmath12  only ) and nearby galaxies , but the results have been inconclusive , suffering from small sample sizes and the inability to control for galaxy type and sfr .",
    "@xcite showed that @xmath12  absorption is common around galaxies of a wide range of morphological types , whereas @xcite showed that strong @xmath0  absorbers ( @xmath13 ) do not correlate with etgs ( see their figure  13 ) .",
    "@xcite found ubiquitous @xmath0  around @xmath14l@xmath15 galaxies at 350@xmath16scales , but could not separate galaxies by type .",
    "most recently , @xcite found that strong @xmath12  absorption ( @xmath17 ) arises in galaxy halos  including less massive etgs  within @xmath18 , but the majority of their pairs lie at large radii ( only 3 pairs at @xmath19 ) .",
    "careful selection of qso sightlines is therefore crucial to study the dependence of cgm gas within 150@xmath16 , and spectroscopy of the host galaxies is important to measure the current sfr and galaxy metallicities .",
    "we designed the cos - halos survey to probe the inner cgm of @xmath20 galaxies at @xmath21 and to test the prevailing theoretical picture of `` hot '' and `` cold '' accretion , which might be related to the observed star formation dichotomy in galaxies @xcite .",
    "cos - halos has several distinct advantages over previous work for assessing the amount and properties of cgm surrounding etgs : ( 1 ) it systematically covers impact parameters @xmath22 kpc and stellar masses @xmath23 with galaxies from both color - magnitude sequences selected prior to knowledge of absorption , ( 2 ) the wavelength range of cos and the galaxy redshifts ( @xmath24 ) generally allow for measurements of the weaker @xmath0  lyman series lines that give better column densities and line broadening parameters than @xmath12  alone , and ( 3 ) the galaxies are well characterized by ground - based optical measurements of their stellar masses , sfrs , and metallicities .",
    "cos - halos has previously found that highly ionized @xmath25  in the halos of etgs occurs at much lower incidence than in star - forming galaxies , such that the presence of @xmath25  out to @xmath26 is related to star formation @xcite .",
    "we will present the full analysis of the @xmath0  absorption for our complete sample of 50 galaxies in a future paper ( tumlinson et al .",
    "2012 , in preparation ) . in this letter , we present results for 16  etgs from cos - halos , showing that their associated @xmath0  gas is plentiful (   [ plentiful ] ) , bound (   [ bound ] ) , cold (   [ cold ] ) , and may represent a large mass of baryons in their cgm (   [ mass ] ) .",
    "the cos - halos survey obtained 39 spectra of qsos at @xmath27 with the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ; * ? ? ? * ) onboard the hubble space telescope ( hst ) under program go-11598 ( pi tumlinson ) .",
    "these data were reduced , co - added , and continuum - normalized with procedures outlined by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we measured column densities for the absorption associated with targeted galaxies using both the apparent optical depth technique ( aod ; * ? ? ? * ) and iterative voigt profile fitting with the measured cos line spread function @xcite .",
    "our measurements for @xmath0  column density are weighted averages of unsaturated lyman lines or profile fits to damped absorption . where all available lyman series lines are saturated we set a lower limit to @xmath28  with the highest - order detected lyman line . the multi - component voigt profile fitting yields @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 for components within each system that are used in   [ cold ] .",
    "the medium - resolution keck and magellan spectroscopy used to derive the properties of the galaxies in the sample ( sfrs , metallicities , etc ) are described fully by @xcite .",
    "the resulting sample contains 16 galaxies classified as passive and/or early type , based on their lack of star - formation ( @xmath32 m@xmath8 yr@xmath33 , * ? ? ?",
    "we caution that these fields have not been uniformly surveyed for all galaxies down to low luminosity limits to eliminate all other possible associations , but these observations empirically describe the distribution of gas around etgs as a function of impact parameter , whatever its source .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows an example of an etg and star - forming galaxy from our sample .",
    "the composite image from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) is shown , along with the @xmath12  absorption owing to the galaxy .",
    "both galaxies have similar @xmath0  column densities and absorption profiles .",
    "figure  [ lya_wr_rho ] plots the @xmath12  rest - frame equivalent width @xmath34 , as a function of impact parameter @xmath35 , and shows the remarkable similarity in @xmath0  strength between the etg ( red ) and sf ( blue ) samples",
    ". a ks test on @xmath34 does not provide significant evidence against the null hypothesis that the two distributions are drawn from the same parent population ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) .",
    "the four @xmath12  non - detections drive the difference in the ks statistic , and offer a hint that the distributions may be slightly different , but we can not separate the distributions in a statistical fashion ; a larger sample of etgs will be needed to show if this difference is real .",
    "we also calculated the `` covering fraction '' @xmath38 of @xmath0  detections .",
    "even if we conservatively assume that the absorbers have the @xmath28  given by the lower limits for saturated lines , we find that the covering fraction above @xmath39 is @xmath40 for sf galaxies , and @xmath41 for the etgs .",
    "this column density has significance as the threshold above which @xcite predicted essentially no absorbers surrounding halos at the etg mass scale , owing to the transition between hot and cold accretion .",
    "our covering fraction result rules out @xmath42 at @xmath4399.9% confidence .",
    "the corresponding covering fractions at @xmath44 are @xmath45 ( sf ) and @xmath46 ( etgs ) , again consistent to within the statistical errors of 0.15 - 0.2 .",
    "thus we find that strong @xmath0  absorption is common around the etgs , and that to the limits of our survey , it does not appear significantly less often or weaker than in the halos of star - forming galaxies .",
    "the detected @xmath0  shows a strong relationship to the targeted etgs",
    ". it is found at separations consistent with being well inside the virial radius ( @xmath47 kpc ) , and it is closely associated with the stars in velocity space .",
    "figure  [ lya_kinematics ] shows the _ full _ velocity range of the detected @xmath0  absorption with respect to the systemic velocity of the galaxy s stars ( set to @xmath48 ) .",
    "the relative errors between absorption and galaxy redshift ( i.e. between the wavelength solutions of the optical and cos spectroscopy ) is @xmath49 .",
    "the filled symbols mark centroid velocities of the fitted components , while the range bars show the full width at zero absorption , a measure of the greatest kinematic extent of the detected @xmath0 .",
    "these velocities are plotted with respect to the inferred dark matter halo mass , which is derived from the photometrically - estimated stellar mass using the mean relation from @xcite .",
    "the dashed curves show the escape velocity from the halos as a function of mass , at distances of 50 , 100 , and 150 kpc ( from outside to inside ) .",
    "nearly all the detected @xmath0  is found at velocities below the escape velocity .",
    "this is true even if we increase the velocity ranges by @xmath50 to account for unconstrained projection effects ( since relative doppler shifts are a sightline - projected lower limit to the true 3d space motion ) .",
    "it is also possible that some of the detected ionized gas is in fact bound to satellite galaxies in the vicinity of the targeted galaxy @xmath28@xmath51 . ]",
    "; if so , the kinematics suggest that the satellites are themselves bound and would be counted among the cgm mass budget for the host galaxy .",
    "we conclude that the detected hi is predominantly bound to its host galaxy , and not escaping at the time it is observed .",
    "because cos - halos typically covers multiple lyman series lines at @xmath52 ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) , we can often derive line - broadening parameters that are not available when relying solely on @xmath12  ( which is almost always saturated ) .",
    "we perform profile fits to derive @xmath28  and doppler @xmath30 for each component , where possible .",
    "these line widths provide robust upper limits on the gas temperature under the assumption that the broadening is purely thermal , @xmath53 . from the measured doppler parameters ( figure  [ nhi_vs_b ] ) we can firmly establish temperature upper limits of @xmath54 ( @xmath55 @xmath56 ) , with 80% at @xmath57 k ( @xmath58 @xmath56 ) .",
    "these line widths are upper limits based on the observed profiles , and can only decrease if the observed profile turns out to be composed of narrower unresolved components , or is significantly affected by non - thermal broadening ( which has shown to be common ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) '' ( bla ) absorption hidden in the profiles ; we can not draw any conclusions about the presence or absence an additional hot gas component in etgs . ] .",
    "we therefore conclude that the detected @xmath0  traces mainly `` cool '' ( possibly photoionized ) gas , at temperatures well below the @xmath59 virial temperatures of halos in this mass range .",
    "these temperatures resemble the expectations for the `` cold mode '' of galaxy gas accretion .",
    "together with the finding that the detected gas is plentiful and bound , this finding suggests that the deposition of cold gas into galaxy halos ( from the inside or the outside ) and/or the formation of clouds at @xmath60 are not fully quenched even in galaxies that have ceased to form stars .",
    "the total mass of cool gas in etg halos is of interest in comparison to their stellar masses and interstellar gas reservoirs .",
    "having measured the covering fraction and typical column density , we can estimate the detected @xmath0  mass from physical arguments and simple models .",
    "the simplest possible mass estimate comes from multiplying a surface density by an area : @xmath61 where we have taken a typical @xmath62 , at which the hit rate is @xmath63 for etgs , and @xmath64 .",
    "this mass of @xmath0  is strictly a lower limit because we have taken the typical minimum @xmath28  permitted by the profiles of saturated lines and surveyed a radius that may not encompass the full cgm mass ( c.f .",
    "the corresponding total mass of cgm hydrogen is @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the typical neutral fraction in the gas .",
    "thus the ionization correction is the major factor in setting the total mass , but the ionization conditions , and thus the total mass of the cgm gas , depend on the unknown temperature and density of the detected material .",
    "modestly overdense gas in the cgm should be exposed to the cosmic ionizing background radiation , which will further suppress the neutral faction and imply a much larger mass .    to estimate",
    "what cgm masses are possible for the etgs we show a simple halo model in figure  [ lya_nhi_rho ] that uses a power - law gas density profile exposed to a uniform ionizing background and held at fixed temperature .",
    "the gas density follows a power - law dependence with radius , @xmath67 , with @xmath68 , normalized to a specific cosmic overdensity @xmath69 at @xmath70 .",
    "the photoionization equilibrium solutions were derived using cloudy @xcite models and including ionization by the haardt & madau photoionizing background ( for @xmath71 ) and the temperature - dependent collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) .",
    "we neglect any photoionizing contribution from the nearby etgs since their star - formation rates are not high enough to contribute significantly to the 1  ryd background in their halos @xcite .",
    "overdensities of @xmath72 are required to match the etg @xmath0  detections with @xmath73 .",
    "this profile gives a total mass of @xmath74 .",
    "the lower model adopts @xmath75 , and is a better match to the non - detections .",
    "note that the results depend less on the chosen temperature than on the density normalization . from these simple models we conclude that the detected cgm is consistent with a mass @xmath76 @xmath77 .",
    "this mass is significant by comparison with the _ interstellar _ gas masses detected in other etgs (   1 ) . at the high end",
    "these masses are potentially significant reservoirs of `` missing baryons '' in the budgets of these massive halos .",
    "we emphasize that these simple models are not rigorous derivations of the ionization correction , from which the actual gas column densities @xmath78 can be inferred .",
    "we will publish separately a full analysis of the gas column densities based on models calibrated to the many available metal lines in these absorbers ( j.  k. werk et al . in preparation ) .",
    "rather , these simple estimates show that etgs harbor a significant mass of cold , bound gas in their cgm .",
    "the cos - halos survey has detected significant quantities of cool , likely photoionized gas bound to the halos of massive early - type galaxies .",
    "the cool gas does not appear to be correlated with star - formation , in stark contrast with @xmath25 , which is strongly dependent on the presence or absence of star - formation @xcite .",
    "the cool gas reservoir may contribute @xmath79 of gas to the halos of etgs , comparable to the interstellar reservoirs (   1 ) , and exists at well below the halo virial temperatures .",
    "this material is typically well within the escape velocities of the host galaxies , so it may be re - accreted by the galaxies and eventually used for star - formation .",
    "the question then becomes , why does the gas not do so ?",
    "these etgs have been quenched , in the usual sense that they are no longer forming stars .",
    "these strong @xmath0  absorbers and the cool cgm they trace were predicted to disappear at the end of cold accretion , which should not operate in halos at this mass @xcite . if @xmath80 is typical of the star forming galaxies in cos - halos as well as the etgs , then the etgs probably have less mass in their cgm _ relative to their stellar and halo masses _ than the sf galaxies ( at least in cool gas ) .",
    "this might be the signature of quenching that can suppress but not completely remove cold gas from the halo , or that the gas can reaccrete long after quenching .",
    "it is also possible that the quenching mechanism _ did _",
    "remove all the cgm gas , after which cold clouds re - accrete from the igm or reform from thermal instabilities in the hot corona .",
    "models that attempt to explain the formation and evolution of etgs will need to account for this significant budget of cold gas in their halos . while it is possible that some of this gas is the direct product of ejection by supernovae while star - formation was occurring , it is perhaps more likely to be gas cooled from their hot halos or falling in from the igm . in this case ,",
    "preventive feedback may act to slow its accretion , allowing only small budgets of interstellar gas to enter the ism and form stars .",
    "some of it ( especially the stronger systems ) may be bound to satellites that are themselves bound to the host , and thus present or future contributors to the diffuse cgm . in any case , our findings indicate that the quiescence of star formation in etgs generally can not be attributed exclusively to the quenching of gas in their circumgalactic medium .",
