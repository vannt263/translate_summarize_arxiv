    "recently non - relativistic version of ads / cft correspondence has received a lot of interest(a partial list of them is@xcite ) .",
    "non - relativistic cfts ( nrcfts ) , are invariant under schrdinger group , which contains galilean group as a subgroup@xcite .",
    "actually the schrdinger group has two elements more than the galilean group : non - relativistic scale and special conformal transformation . under nonrelativistic - scaling ( nr - scale ) time and space scale",
    "differently    [ nrscale ] te^ t , xe^x and the special conformal transformation is given by t x    these transformations must combine with an appropriate change of fields for the action to be invariant .",
    "it is also known ( see @xcite and references therein ) that the schrdinger algebra can be derived from relativistic conformal algebra in one higher dimension . to see this ,",
    "let us consider a complex massless scalar field in @xmath0 dimensions which is invariant under conformal group @xmath1    s= d^d+1x _ ^^. by going to the light - cone coordinate    t= , = , and taking @xmath2 to have a definite momentum in @xmath3 direction , @xmath4 , we arrive at    [ flatfreeaction ] s = dt d^d-1x ( -i m^_t+i m_t^+_i^i^ ) which is the free schrdinger action in @xmath5 dimensions and is invariant under schrdinger group .",
    "therefore the schrdinger group may be thought of as a subgroup of conformal group in one higher dimension that does not mix modes with different momentum @xmath6 along the null direction @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "an important quantity in field theories is energy - momentum tensor , which must be traceless in weyl invariant theories on a curved space .",
    "actually this symmetry is anomalous and one interesting feature of @xmath7 correspondence is that the weyl anomaly of boundary field theory can be computed from gravity dual @xcite .",
    "in analogy with relativistic case , the energy - momentum tensor of nrcfts must obey the trace identity , and one may expect that by using the holographic renormalization for non - relativistic backgrounds ( see@xcite ) an anomaly appears in the ward identity of energy - momentum tensor .",
    "so it is interesting to consider nrcfts on curved special space and study the issue of weyl anomaly for these theories .",
    "let us review some aspects of the cfts on curved spaces @xcite .",
    "indeed it is well known that _ _",
    "weyl__@xmath8_diff _ invariant theories are invariant under the conformal group of the background . to see this ,",
    "consider the weyl transformation    g_e^ g _ , and note also that under the conformal transformations the metric changes by a factor which can be absorbed by a weyl transformation .",
    "motivated by this definition of weyl transformation , we will define the nr - weyl symmetry which guaranties that the theory becomes invariant under nr - scale transformation ( [ nrscale ] ) on flat space .    as in the relativistic case where scale invariance implies that the improved energy - momentum tensor is traceless @xcite    ^_=0",
    ", the nr - scale symmetry implies that the _ non - relativistic trace _ of improved energy - momentum tensor is zero too    [ trace ] 2t^00-t^i_i=0 .",
    "on the other hand it is known that relativistic weyl symmetry breaks at the quantum level @xcite ^_=(g _ ) , where the anomaly @xmath9 depends on the geometry of space .",
    "a natural question is whether the equation ( [ trace ] ) holds at the quantum level too ? actually we find that nrcfts do not admit _ geometric anomaly _ , i.e. nr - weyl anomaly is zero for free nrcfts on curved spatial space , though nr - weyl anomaly can appear in the interacting theories .",
    "this is different from the relativistic case where the free cfts admit weyl anomaly as well .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we give a definition of nr - weyl symmetry . in section 3",
    "we calculate the nr - weyl anomaly . in section 4",
    "we analyze anomaly from light - cone point of view .",
    "we end in section 5 with conclusions and some comments .",
    "when a relativistic field theory on curved space has weyl symmetry , it becomes a cft on flat space . in a similar way we can define nr - weyl symmetry for nr - field theory on curved spacial space in such way that a nr - weyl invariant filed theory becomes nrcft on the flat space ) , though in all cases that we will consider the special conformal transformation is also a symmetry of action in flat space ] .",
    "in other words nr - scale symmetry must be in the residual symmetries of nr - weyl invariant field theory when the metric becomes flat .",
    "now consider the following transformation    [ nrw ] h_ij = e^h_ij  ,  t=e^t where @xmath10 is the metric of special space and @xmath11 is a constant .",
    "suppose a field theory is invariant under the above transformation , it is easy to see that it becomes a nrcft in flat space . actually under nr - scaling ( [ nrscale ] ) ,",
    "the time and flat metric transform as @xmath12 and this factors can be absorbed by a nr - weyl transformation such that the action remain invariant .",
    "so symmetry under ( [ nrw ] ) guaranties the field theory becomes invariant under non - relativistic scale transformation ( [ nrscale ] ) in flat space .",
    "hence we take the ( [ nrw ] ) for the definition of nr - weyl transformation .",
    "to proceed let us consider the simplest case ; free schrodinger field in 2 + 1 dimensions on a curved spatial space    [ freeaction ] s_free = dt d^2x h = dt d^2x h ( i m^_t - i m _",
    "t^-h^ij_j^_i ) , where @xmath6 is mass of the particle .",
    "this action is invariant under nr - weyl transformation ( [ nrw ] ) if @xmath13 transforms in the following way :    [ wpesi ] ^(x , t)=e^-(x , t ) nr - weyl symmetry implies that    [ noether ] h_ij+ _ = 0 .",
    "the first term is spatial part of canonical energy - momentum tensor [ emtf ] t^ij_f==h^ij(i m ^_t - i m _ t^-^k^_k)+^j^^i+^i^^j . by making use of this expression , the equation ( [ noether ] ) can be recast to the following form    [ nrtrace ] h_ijt^ij - im^_t+im_t^=0 .",
    "one could also add interacting terms to the action which preserve the nr - weyl symmetry .",
    "for example the following interactions are nr - weyl invariant :    [ interactions]d^2x h ^^ , d^2x h d^2y h ^(x)^(x ) ( y)(y ) the first one describes non - relativistic bosons interacting via a @xmath14 function potential with strength @xmath15 @xcite , while the second one describes non - relativistic particles interacting through a @xmath16 potential .",
    "we now examine the validity of classical identity ( [ nrtrace ] ) at the quantum level .",
    "quantum anomaly comes from the renormalization of the theory .",
    "actually the matrix elements of energy - momentum tensor are divergent and must be regularized before taking trace in ( [ nrtrace ] ) , and it is not clear whether the regularized energy - momentum tensor obeys nr - trace identity ( [ nrtrace ] ) .",
    "let us first consider the free field ( [ freeaction ] ) , which can be expanded in terms of energy eigenstates , @xmath17 :    [ solution ] ( x , t)=c _",
    "n a_n _ n(x ) e^-i_n t    according to canonical quantization we have ( by appropriate choice of @xmath18 in ( [ solution ] ) )    = _ n , m .",
    "the vacuum state is defined by @xmath19 , and the exited states can be built by acting on @xmath20 with the creation operators .",
    "since there is no negative energy in non - relativistic case the mode expansion ( [ solution ] ) does not contain creation operator , @xmath21 , the expectation value of free energy - momentum tensor ( [ emtf ] ) between any states is finite and so nr - trace identity ( [ nrtrace ] ) holds at the quantum level for free nrcfts . in other words unlike relativistic case , there is no _ geometric anomaly _ in nrcft s .    on the other hand for interacting theories",
    ", classical symmetry can be broken due to quantum corrections .",
    "indeed nr - weyl transformation ( [ nrw ] ) includes time scaling and thus the scale of energy is changed by this transformation . if @xmath22 function is nonzero , this implies that the shift of the coupling constant , @xmath15 , under nr - weyl transformation is gg-(g ) , and the lagrangian is changed in the following way -(g ) , so that the classical identity ( [ nrtrace ] ) will be corrected by the quantum correction as follows @xcite : [ nrwanomaly ] 2t^tt - t^i_i==- . therefore the nr - weyl anomaly is given by @xmath22 function which depends on the details of interaction and the geometry of space . to clarify how the geometry of space enters the calculating of @xmath23 function",
    ", we will compute the @xmath23 function for an interacting bosonic system on a sphere in the next section .",
    "consider a system of bosonic particles in @xmath24 dimensions interacting via a @xmath14-function potential on a sphere .",
    "the action of this system can be derived by taking nr limit from the relativistic @xmath25 theory , and is given by ( we set @xmath26 ) [ iaction ] s = dt d^2x h ( i ^_t - i _",
    "t^-h^ij_i_j^+^^ )    the free field solution on sphere can be expanded in terms of spherical harmonic functions @xmath27 :    ( x , t)=_l , m a_l , my_l , m ( , ) e^-i e_l t where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is radius of the sphere .",
    "the feynman propagator in position space is    [ feynmanpropagator ] d_f(x , t , x,t)&=&0|t ( x , t ) ^(x,t)|0=(t - t)_l , m y_l , m ( , ) y^*_l , m( , )e^-i e_l ( t - t ) + & = & _ l , m y_l , m ( , ) y^*_l , m( ,  ) while in the momentum space it is given by    d_f(l , m,,l,m,)&=d^2x h d^2x h dt dt e^i ( t- t)y^*_l , m(x ) y_l,m(x ) 0|t ( x , t ) ^(x,t)|0&=r^2(2)(- ) _ l , l_m , m    now consider the two - point function(see fig[2pointfunction ] )     function in ( [ feynmanpropagator ] ) and normal ordering in action ( [ iaction ] ) all loop contributions are zero .",
    "so the mass and field are not renormalized .        to evaluate the @xmath22 function , we must compute the four - point function at one - loop level by inserting a _ renormalization condition _ at scale @xmath30 , which we assume to be    [ rc ] ( l_1,l_2,l_3,l_4,m_1,m_2,m_3,m_4 ) _    l_2=l_4=0 , l_1=l_3= m_1=m_2=m_3=m_4=0    = -ig where @xmath31 is the four - point function in the momentum space . function and normalization due to integration over @xmath32s , and also external propagators ]",

    ". renormalization condition ( [ rc ] ) implies that the counterterm , @xmath34 , must be        [ counterterm ] g = ^_l_5,l_6 ( l_5,l_6,0,0|l,0)^2 . leading to a non zero @xmath22 function defining by @xmath35 , and the nr - weyl anomaly",

    ", we must take angular momentum @xmath37 to be large .",
    "also we approximate the sum in ( [ counterterm ] ) by integration and calculate the integral for large @xmath38 . by using the asymptotic expression for clebsh - gordon coefficients @xcite",

    "the anomaly can be read from ( [ nrwanomalysphere ] ) as follows    [ flatanomaly ] = ^^in agreement with the result of @xcite .",
    "as noted in the introduction , nrcfts can be derived from cfts in one higher dimension by light - cone procedure . in this section",
    "we generalize this approach to the curved space .",
    "since cfts on curved space are weyl invariant , let us start with the _ _ weyl__@xmath40_diff_-invariant complex massless scalar filed in 3 + 1 dimensions [ s ] s_1",
    "+ 3=d^4x g ( g^ _ _ ^- r ^ ) this action is invariant under relativistic weyl transformation g^,e^(x ) g^ , , ( x)e^(x ) which implies that the energy - momentum tensor is traceless    [ rtrace ] ^_=0 , this identity receives quantum anomaly    [ ranomaly ] ^_=(g _ ) which depends on the geometry of space - time .    to study nr - field theory on curved spatial space",
    "we choose the following form for the metric    [ fixedmetric ] ds^2=-dx^2_0+dx^2_3+h_ijdx^idx^j .",
    "going to the light cone coordinates    [ lcmetric ] ds^2=-2dtd+h_ijdx^idx^j and assuming that the @xmath2 has a definite light - cone momentum @xmath4 , the equation ( [ s ] ) becomes    [ action2 ] s_1 + 2=dt d^2x h ( i m^_t - i m_t^+h^ij_i_j^- r_h ^ ) . from the equation ( [ rtrace ] ) or by using noether current , one can show that the energy - momentum tensor of above action , @xmath41 , satisfies the following equation    2t^tt - t^i _ i=0 .",
    "if the light - cone procedure works in quantum level , the equation ( [ ranomaly ] ) should reduce to    [ lcanomaly ] 2t^tt - t^i_i=(h_ij ) . on the other hand we saw in section 2 that nr - weyl anomaly occurs only in interacting theories .",
    "actually by the same approach of section 2 one can show that nr - weyl anomaly is zero for ( [ action2 ] ) and indeed the equation ( [ lcanomaly ] ) is not correct .",
    "thus the light - cone procedure dose not lead to the correct result at the quantum level .",
    "therefore a natural question would be what is the symmetry of the action ( [ action2 ] ) ? since we have started from a _ _ weyl__@xmath8_diff_-invariant action and then the metric has been fixed in the form of ( [ fixedmetric ] ) and also we have kept a sector with a definite light - cone momentum , the residual symmetry of the equation ( [ action2 ] ) consists of those transformations , @xmath42 , that satisfy the following conditions [ symmetry ] ockv ( ) and=0 where @xmath43 is the set of conformal killing vectors of the metric ( [ lcmetric ] ) .    in order for the action ( [ action2 ] ) to have nontrivial symmetry , ) for every @xmath10 ] the metric @xmath10 must have ckv .",
    "if we write ( [ action2 ] ) on a compact 2 dimensional manifold , we have only two choices , @xmath45 with 6 ckv and @xmath46 whit 2 ckv",
    ". the conformal killing vectors of ( [ lcmetric ] ) which satisfy ( [ symmetry ] ) for @xmath45 are    & h=_t , p_=_&l_1=_+ _ ,  l_2=_+ _ ,  l_3= _    so the symmetry algebra of ( [ action2 ] ) on sphere is @xmath47 . in other words ,",
    "the action is only invariant under the isometry of sphere , not by those c.k.vs which give a factor to the metric of sphere .",
    "also we have @xmath48 symmetry for torus .",
    "with definition of weyl transformation in nr field theories , we have shown that nr - weyl anomaly is not a geometric effect and only appears in interacting theories .",
    "an important difference between the weyl symmetry which we have defined in ( [ nrw ] ) and those in the relativistic case is that the relativistic weyl transformation is local , while the nr - weyl transformation is not local in the sense that @xmath11 in ( [ nrw ] ) is not a function of position .",
    "actually the free action is not invariant under local nrweyl transformation",
    ". it would be interesting to write down an action with local nr - weyl symmetry and study the theory on flat space with conformal symmetry in special space@xcite ( see @xcite for affine extension a class of nonrelativistic algebras including non centrally - extended schrodinger algebra and galilean conformal algebra ( gca ) in 2 + 1 dimensions ) .",
    "we have also discussed anomaly from light - cone point of view , where we have observed that the light cone procedure dose not work at the quantum level and it would be interesting to explore the exact relation between nrcfts and cfts in one higher dimension at the quantum level @xcite .",
    "s = dt d^dx ( ^2 - ( ) ^z ) due to the presence of the _ negative energy _ , one would expect that such theories admit _ geometric anomaly_.
