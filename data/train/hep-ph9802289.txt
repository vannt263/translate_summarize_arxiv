    "the @xmath1 and @xmath2 parameters have been determined using the constraints from the measurements of @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath26 and from the limit on @xmath33 : @xmath34 contrary to similar studies in this field , which claim a rather symmetric interval of variation for @xmath20 , around zero @xcite , the negative @xmath20 region is excluded at about 93@xmath35 c.l ..    present measurements assume the unitarity of the ckm matrix . in this framework the value of @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be also deduced .",
    "they are : @xmath38 the value of @xmath39 has an accuracy similar to the one expected after the first years of running at b factories .",
    "the region centered on zero is favoured for @xmath37 in accordance with the anzats of @xcite .",
    "values of the angle @xmath9 larger or equal to @xmath40 are disfavoured ( @xmath41 ) and present determinations of @xmath20 and @xmath21 allow to predict , in a precise way , the value for the ratio ( using the model of @xcite ) : @xmath42    the other parametrization of the ckm matrix , proposed in @xcite has been studied .",
    "the four corresponding parameters , which are angles , have been determined : @xmath18 @xmath19 present values of @xmath17 agree with the maximal cp violation scenario proposed in @xcite .    the internal consistency of the standard model expectation for cp violation , expressed by a single phase parameter in the c.k.m .",
    "matrix , has been verified by removing , in turn , the different constraints imposed by the external parameters .",
    "no anomaly has been noticed with respect to the central values used in the present analysis , in agreement with the small value of the @xmath43 of the fit of @xmath20 and @xmath21 alone .",
    "this study has mainly quantified the needed accuracy on the different determinations of these parameters so that they bring useful constraints in the determination of @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in this respect ,",
    "present uncertainties on @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 have important contributions .",
    "low values of @xmath46 , below 0.6 , are not compatible with the present analysis at 90@xmath35 c.l ..    @xmath33 is expected to lie within 1@xmath47 between 8 and 16 @xmath48 .",
    "a measurement of this parameter seems to be possible at lep .",
    "more accurate measurements , still expected at cleo and lep , and more precise evaluations of non perturbative qcd parameters from lattice qcd , will improve these results in the coming years , before the start up of b factories . a tau / charm factory providing accurate values for @xmath49 and @xmath50",
