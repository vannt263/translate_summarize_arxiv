    "the importance of the quadrupole of a binary system relies mainly in its connection to gravitational radiation via einstein s famous quadrupole formula  @xcite .",
    "this formula is beautifully confirmed by taylor s binary pulsar  @xcite , the indirect proof of the existence of gravitational waves , for which hulse and taylor have been awarded with the nobel price in 1993 .",
    "direct detection of gravity waves will ( hopefully ) be realized in the next few years by the numerous experiments operating today .",
    "the question whether gravitational waves from binary systems can be detected via their effects on the propagation of photons has been addressed repeatedly in the past . in @xcite to @xcite the deflection angle and the time delay caused by a gravity wave passing through the path of the photon is analyzed from different points of view , and only in 1998 the solid conclusion to this problem was given by kopeikin et al .",
    "@xcite : these effects are too faint to be detectable today .    in  @xcite the problem is faced in full generality , determining the time delay , @xmath1 , and deflection angle , @xmath2 caused by a localized source of gravitational radiation , @xmath3 acting as a deflector of light ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . in  @xcite ,",
    "a multipole expansion for the energy momentum tensor of the source is used . in",
    "@xcite this expansion is truncated at the quadrupole and the resulting gravitational field is expressed in terms of the deflector mass , its angular momentum and quadrupole .    in this paper",
    "we study the effect of the lens quadrupole not on gravity wave production , but on the scalar potential which is responsible for lensing .",
    "especially , we want to compute its contribution to microlensing .",
    "the quadrupole is the lowest multipole contributing to the emission of gravitational waves .",
    "the scalar potential , however , contains also the larger monopole and dipole contributions .",
    "navely , one might expect that therefore the quadrupole is irrelevant , unobservable .",
    "we shall show here that this is not the case .",
    "for impact parameters close to the critical line , which are those with large amplification , the quadrupole contribution to the amplification is significantly enhanced and can become observable . furthermore , mass and angular momentum are conserved quantities , while the quadrupole is in general time dependent",
    ". it will therefore introduce a time - dependence in the microlensing signal which we determine .",
    "a direct detection of such a modulation can give important information about the quadrupole of the lens and therefore on the gravitational radiation it emits .",
    "this can be very useful for the observation of gravitational radiation from the system .",
    "but even if the effect is not observed directly , because of the under sampling of data or because the period of the lens system is of the same order than the time - scale of microlensing event , it has to be taken into account as a possible source of error in static parameters estimations , especially for high amplification events . we conclude the paper with a rate estimation , taking into account only compact binaries of our galaxy as example .",
    "however , we observe that , more generally , such a modulation effect can be given by any object with a varying quadrupole .",
    "our result gives a new tool to determine the quadrupole of a unknown system independent of its nature .",
    "we stress that the modulation can be detected only if the period of the system is smaller than the time - scale of microlensing _",
    "i.e. _ for relatively compact binaries with periods of less than about 30 days .",
    "+   the light from a source @xmath4 is lensed by a deflector ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the impact parameter @xmath6 is a vector in the lens plane .",
    "the distances of @xmath5 from the observer and from the light source respectively are @xmath7 and @xmath8 , title=\"fig:\",width=340 ] +    we work in the thin lens approximation , which means that we may project the lens mass distribution into a plane and we consider impact parameters @xmath9 much smaller than the distances @xmath7 and @xmath10 in figure  1 .",
    "furthermore , we assume the condition @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the frequency of the binary , so that retardation inside the lens plane can be neglected .",
    "we employ the center of mass system , _",
    "i.e. _ the coordinate system where the center of mass of the binary is at rest at position @xmath13 .",
    "up to the quadrupole , the gravitational lens potential is then given by  @xcite [ psi ] ( , t^*)=d  , where we have set @xmath14 and @xmath15 denotes retarded time , @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 is the unit vector pointing from the source to the observer , @xmath18 is the total mass of the system , @xmath19 is its angular momentum and @xmath20 is the transverse traceless quadrupole tensor , projected into the plane normal to @xmath17 , @xmath21i_{ij}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath22 denotes the energy momentum tensor of the source and @xmath23 is the energy density . since the background spacetime is minkowski , spatial index positions are irrelevant . the time delay and the deflection angle can be expressed in terms of @xmath24 as  @xcite = -4 + 2m(4rr_0 )  , _ i=4_i  .",
    "the amplification of a far away light source with @xmath25 , is now easily determined as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the jacobian of the lens map ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , [ aij ] a_ij=_ij-4r_i_j(,t^ * ) .    without loss of generality , we fix the orientation of the coordinate system so that the @xmath28 axis is aligned with the impact vector and the third axis is normal to the lens plane . hence @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 . from eqs .",
    "( [ psi],[aij ] ) one then obtains the following expression for @xmath33 , @xmath34~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we use that in our coordinate system @xmath35 is entirely determined by @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the quadrupole tensor @xmath38 has to be evaluated at retarded time @xmath39 t he largest term containing the quadrupole @xmath40 is suppressed with respect to the monopole @xmath41 , by a factor @xmath42 . if @xmath43 denotes the mayor half axis of the binary , we have @xmath44 , hence the suppression is of the order of @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , one might suggest that systems with large orbits have the strongest contribution from the quadrupole .",
    "this is true , but in this case the time variation may not be visible if the period of the system is larger than the duration of the event , @xmath46 . here",
    "@xmath47 is the source velocity ( projected into the lens plane ) .",
    "furthermore , our expansion breaks down at @xmath48 since higher multipoles can no longer be neglected and the microlensing event probes the full matter distribution of the lens . this more complex phenomenon has been studied extensively in the literature , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite to @xcite . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to @xmath49 , say .",
    "we are mainly interested in compact binaries which usually also generate a significant amount of gravitational waves .",
    "the amplification is largest close to the critical line defined by @xmath50 . neglecting the sub - dominant contributions this corresponds to the einstein radius @xmath51 , the critical impact parameter . for large amplification , @xmath52 . to illustrate this",
    ", we consider a binary with angular momentum normal to the lens plane , and take into account only the dominant contribution from the quadrupole in eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) , @xmath53 .",
    "we parameterize the quadrupole term by @xmath54 here @xmath55 is a dimensionless function of order unity which contains the information about the time dependence of the quadrupole and hence , e.g. on the frequency of the gravitational gave emitted by the system .",
    "the amplification can then be approximated by [ muapprox ] ^-1 1- @xmath56 ^ 4@xmath57  , =  . we want to consider the case @xmath58 with @xmath59 . in this case",
    "we have to lowest order in the small parameters @xmath60 and @xmath1 [ muapprox2 ] =  .",
    "we conclude that the contribution from the quadrupole is significant if the ratio @xmath61 is significant , say larger than a few percent .    as usual , our ray optical approach gives rise to a divergence of the amplification when the impact parameter approaches the critical value @xmath62 .",
    "the amplification grows indefinitely when @xmath63 decreases toward the critical value . at distances smaller than @xmath64",
    "there are in principle multiple images , but they are too close together to be resolved by present optical telescopes . the divergences in the geometrical optics treatment is removed in the correct treatment using wave optics  @xcite .",
    "in this section we present some examples for the modulation of the magnification by microlensing by compact binaries in our galaxy .",
    "it is worth to stress that such a modulation can be produced by any system having a varying quadrupole , and our result can be applied to more general cases than the ones discussed here . in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] we choose for the bs two equal masses @xmath65 in circular orbit in the lens plane so that the spin is aligned with the 3-axis , @xmath66 .",
    "we consider a background source moving with 100km / s relative to the lens @xmath67 .",
    "+ in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the amplification is plotted as function of time for a neutron star or white dwarf binary . a rotation period of @xmath68sec , corresponding to an orbital radius of @xmath69 km is assumed .",
    "the binary is placed at distance @xmath70pc .",
    "the impact parameter is @xmath71 yielding an amplification of about @xmath72 .",
    "this is very close to the critical impact parameter @xmath73 km which gives infinite amplification ( within a ray optical treatment ) .",
    "the quadrupole modulation amounts to @xmath74 of the static contribution at maximum amplification .",
    "our nave estimate gives a relative contribution @xmath75 from the quadrupole , which is in the right ballpark .",
    "+ in the second example , plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we take a deflector somewhat further away , @xmath76pc , and consider a binary with period , @xmath77sec @xmath78days . for this system , @xmath79 km",
    "the impact parameter of this case is @xmath80 yielding a maximal amplification of about 7 .",
    "the quadrupole modulation amounts still to 11@xmath81 at maximum . here",
    "the modulation signal is less significant since @xmath82 is larger , and also the period of the system is significantly longer .",
    "the amplification is plotted as a function of time .",
    "the dashed line represents the mass ( static ) contribution and the solid line is the total ( mass + quadrupole ) signal .",
    "this corresponds to a microlensing event by a neutron star or white dwarf binary with parameters @xmath83day and @xmath84 .",
    "the impact parameter is @xmath85.,width=264,height=264 ]     as fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , but for a binary with parameters @xmath86 days , @xmath87 , @xmath88.,width=264,height=264 ]    in order to gain a good _ qualitative _ intuition of this phenomenon one can visualize the lines of equal amplification for a lens system .",
    "for a point - mass they are circles around the deflector .",
    "if a non - vanishing quadrupole moment is present , the circle of divergence as well as the circles of equal amplification are deformed as shown in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "they are simply the solutions of the equation @xmath89 and @xmath90 constant respectively , as a function of the angle between @xmath6 and the direction of the vector relating the two stars of the binary .",
    "this vector rotates with the period of the system and with it the deformed circles .",
    "the observed modulation of the amplification comes from the rotation of the non - circular curves of constant amplification in the lens plane .",
    "the deformation of the circles is quite faint but since the amplification becomes so large close to the critical line , the quadrupole is nevertheless observable .",
    "furthermore , our _ quantitative _ examples show that quadrupole modulations of high importance can appear using quite reasonable parameters for the lensing system , and for this reason , even if the modulations can not be detected directly , they have to be included in the error budget for microlensing events with high magnification , @xmath91 , if one wants to reach an accuracy in the predicted light curve of about 10% or better .",
    "we stress that the modulation can only be observed if the period of the binary is shorter than the time interval over which the amplification is significant .",
    "+     example of lines of equal amplification for a binary system .",
    "the dots indicate the position of the stars and the center of mass respectively . , width=264,height=264 ]    it is interesting that observing such an event in the lisa range of frequencies , permits at the same time to determine the frequency and direction of the binary as source for gravitational waves",
    ". this will allow to detect the corresponding gravity wave signal out of the confusion noise in the lisa data  @xcite .",
    "the idea to detect gravity waves via microlensing has been studied in  @xcite , and more recently in  @xcite , but in these works the gravity wave source and the static lens are two different objects , the first being far enough from the second to make the quadrupole time dependence discussed here unimportant .",
    "+ in this paper we consider the quadrupole variation of the deflector itself and we study its contribution to the scalar lens potential .",
    "the effect from the also emitted dynamical gravitational wave is much smaller than the one considered here in the frequency range we are interested in ( @xmath92 ) , since it is proportional to the second time derivative of the quadrupole .",
    "+ however , measuring the modulation of @xmath33 provides access to information about the variation of @xmath38 itself .",
    "for example , it allows to predict the frequency and amplitude of the gravity waves emitted by the system .",
    "as we have seen above , in order for the modulation to be measurable , the microlensing event has to reach rather high magnification .",
    "configuration for the bulge survey .",
    "the black triangle represents the volume used to determine @xmath93 . , width=264 ]",
    "we focus on a galactic bulge survey where the observed field is about @xmath94 centered on galactic coordinates @xmath95 , @xmath96 , which contains about @xmath97 bulge stars  @xcite . using the binary population model of tutukov ",
    "yungelson  @xcite we can estimate the number of galactic black hole , neutron star and white dwarf binaries to be about @xmath98 . within the volume swept by the light rays coming from our sources , we expect to find about a fraction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) @xmath99 of these binaries , leading to @xmath100 . here",
    "@xmath101kpc is the radius of the galactic disk and @xmath102pc is its thickness and @xmath103kpc is the apparent thickness of the galactic disc in the direction of the survey .",
    "+ the cross section @xmath104 of the events for which the modulation is visible is about @xmath105 . with this",
    "the fraction @xmath106 of the observed field covered by a binary per unit time is given @xmath107 , where @xmath47 is the center of mass velocity of the source with respect to the binary and @xmath108 is the area of the observed field . with @xmath76pc and @xmath109km",
    "/ sec we obtain an event rate = ~0.1  events / year  .",
    "note also , that we have taken into account only microlensing by compact binaries .",
    "main sequence binaries which are sufficiently close , so that @xmath49 , say may very well contribute a more substantial event rate .",
    "furthermore , the modulations might be due to different objects with a varying quadrupole , e.g cosmic strings  @xcite .",
    "this event rate seems not out of reach of observations and it is already interesting to investigate whether such an event is not present in existing microlensing surveys , that is whether a varying quadrupole behavior may fit one of the exotic microlensing events detected so far .    even if the modulation can not be detected directly , the contributions from the quadrupole and the angular momentum are sufficiently important that they have to be included in the error budget for microlensing events with high magnification , @xmath91 , if one wants to reach an accuracy in the predicted light curve of about 10% .",
    "let us finally estimate the contribution of the dipole .",
    "the dominant effect coming from the spin is the term @xmath110 . parameterizing @xmath111 , where @xmath112 denotes the frequency of the binary and@xmath113 is the orbital velocity .",
    "hence @xmath114 its relative contribution is of the order of @xmath115 , where @xmath116 denotes the orbital velocity of the binary , @xmath117 when @xmath63 approaches @xmath64 also this term is parametrically enhanced leading to a magnification [ spin ] _ s  .",
    "this term is significant only for very compact and therefore very fast binaries , @xmath118 km  @xmath119 km , which then have to be sufficiently close so that @xmath64 is relatively small and @xmath120 is still significant for @xmath121 .",
    "more precisely one finds @xmath122 hence we need @xmath123 for the spin amplification to amount to at least @xmath124 .",
    "this looks quite unreasonable for amplifications which are not gigantic .",
    "this term is also more difficult to disentangle from the monopole since it is time independent like the latter .",
    "in this paper we have derived and discussed a new effect which leads to a modulation of the light curve on microlensing events from compact time dependent source where the impact parameter @xmath63 is larger than the size of the source . a simple analysis of the amplification modulation of such an event allows to determine important parameters of the lens quadrupole such as its frequency and its amplitude .",
    "these can then be used to predict the gravitational radiation emitted from the system .",
    "this effect is of particular importance in microlensing events by compact binaries .",
    "the relative contribution to the magnification from the quadrupole being of the order of @xmath125 , the effect is most significant for high magnification . a rate estimation for galactic compact binaries shows that typical microlensing surveys towards the galactic bulge should detect about one such event every decade .",
    "but even in cases where it is not observed directly , the effect has to be included in the error budget for the microlensing light curve .",
