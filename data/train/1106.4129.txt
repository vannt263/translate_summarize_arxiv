    "the theoretical understanding of out - of - equilibrium systems , and in particular non - equilibrium steady states , is nowadays one of the major quests of statistical physics .",
    "these systems exhibit a great variety of behavior , including genuinely non - equilibrium phase transitions and critical phenomena , ubiquitous strong - coupling regimes , recurrent absence of lower critical dimension , etc .",
    "numerous partial results have been obtained at various levels , but all - purpose , analytical , and systematic methods to treat non - equilibrium problems are scarce .",
    "the nonperturbative renormalization group ( nprg ) is one such method , and this paper is devoted to detail its implementation for out - of - equilibrium systems . indeed , many remarkable results have already been obtained in statistical physics using the nprg approach not only at equilibrium in systems such as frustrated magnets @xcite , the random field or random bond ising model @xcite , membranes @xcite , bosonic systems @xcite , but also out - of - equilibrium , where one can mention important advances in reaction - diffusion systems @xcite , and for the kardar - parisi - zhang universality class @xcite .    the starting point for applying nprg methods is a field theory .",
    "such a field theory is usually obtained by following one of two possible routes .",
    "either one starts from an effective mesoscopic description in terms of a langevin equation and one then resorts to the janssen - de dominicis formalism @xcite to construct a functional integral representation of this equation , upon introducing an additional martin - siggia - rose response field @xcite . or , and",
    "this is the other route , one starts from a microscopic master equation that can be mapped onto a functional integral following the doi - peliti procedure @xcite . when both descriptions coexist the resulting field theories are of course equivalent ( see however @xcite for important subtleties in the derivation of the equivalence of the janssen - de dominicis and doi - peliti field theories ) .",
    "both field theoretical formulations are derived in discrete time , and a crucial ambiguity arises when performing the continuous - time limit @xcite .",
    "this problem implies the choice of a prescription in the continuum version ( usually related to the it@xmath0 s or stratonovitch s discretization scheme ) , the consequences of which still deserve discussions ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . roughly speaking ,",
    "the janssen - de dominicis transformation for instance involves a determinant which depends on the original discretization of time .",
    "this determinant can be conveniently set to unity upon adopting it@xmath0 s discretization scheme and imposing the related prescription in subsequent calculations .",
    "this prescription is easily implemented in perturbation theory : it amounts to cancel out tadpole diagrams @xcite .",
    "the implications of this choice of time - discretization within the nprg formalism have yet to be clarified and is one of the main subjects of this paper .",
    "we shall first identify the consequences of it@xmath0 s discretization in nprg flow equations and then device a simple procedure to systematically encode them .",
    "this will be the opportunity to review some other important technical aspects arising when implementing , out - of - equilibrium , the most popular approximation scheme of the exact nprg equation , the derivative expansion @xcite .    to guide us in the task of understanding the consequences of it@xmath0 s discretization in the nprg framework , we first review , in section [ disc ] , the discrete - time version of non - equilibriumfield theories ensuing from the two standard janssen - de dominicis and doi - peliti procedures , analyze causality issues , and recall the usual prescription to encode it@xmath0 s discretization in perturbation theory . section [ nprg ] is dedicated to expounding the specificities of the nprg framework when applied to non - equilibriumsystems .",
    "causality issues are postponed to section [ ito ] , which focusses on identifying the relevant prescription associated with it@xmath0 s time - discretization in the nprg context , and where we propose a simple `` regularization '' procedure to encode it .",
    "even though it can be ( and has been ) applied to genuinely out - of - equilibrium problems , we illustrate it , in section  [ modela ] , to a relaxation - towards - equilibrium problem , the critical dynamics of model a. in section [ supersymmetry ] , we show that for such models satisfying time - reversal symmetry , one can build a supersymmetric formulation of nprg . not only this formulation is elegant and convenient for actual calculations but , more importantly here , it is free from any ambiguity regarding the continuous - time limit @xcite .",
    "once the supersymmetric nprg formalism is set up , it is applied to model a , which allows us to check that the two approaches yield identical results .",
    "as it constitutes the basis of the following discussions , we start by recalling the derivation of the field theory associated with an out - of - equilibrium stochastic model .",
    "we review the two standard procedures , starting from a langevin equation or starting from a master equation . in both cases",
    ", the choice made for the continuous - time limit plays an important technical role both perturbatively and nonperturbatively .",
    "many models ( such as reaction - diffusion systems ) are defined at a microscopic scale by a set of dynamical rules .",
    "the time evolution of these systems is governed by a master equation , which , in an operator representation , can be written as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the ket associated with the probability law of the system , @xmath3 are the fock states ( number states ) and @xmath4 is the operator , expressed in terms of creation and annihilation operators , representing the kernel of the master equation .",
    "( [ master ] ) can be cast into a field theory following the doi - peliti procedure @xcite .",
    "we do not review it in detail here ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , but merely stress a few points regarding the ordering of discrete times .",
    "the mean value of an observable @xmath5 at time @xmath6 can be expressed in the operator representation as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the projection state satisfying @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the procedure consists in splitting the evolution operator @xmath11 in @xmath12 time slices of width @xmath13 and in inserting in each a closure relation written in terms of the coherent states @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 . at first order in @xmath13 and after re - exponentiation , it writes @xmath17 by computing the usual nonvanishing overlap @xmath18 of coherent states , one deduces ( at first order in @xmath13 ) the generating functional @xmath19 = \\displaystyle \\int \\prod_{\\alpha=0}^n   \\frac{d^2 \\phi_\\alpha}{\\pi } \\exp\\left(-\\sum_{k=1}^n \\phi_k^*(\\phi_k-\\phi_{k-1})+\\tau \\sum_{k=1}^n { \\cal w}(\\phi_k^*,\\phi_{k-1})+j_k\\phi_k+\\bar{j}_k\\phi_k^*\\right)\\ ] ] where the initial conditions and final time contributions have been omitted since our focus is on stationary states and a loss of memory of initial conditions is assumed ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite for details ) .",

    "the discrete sums become integrals over time and @xmath24 tends to @xmath25 . as we shall see in the following , this continuous version of the model becomes ambiguous when the inverse of the operator @xmath26 , that is @xmath27 , appears at coinciding times . to remove these ambiguities ,",

    "an example of a field theory derived from a master equation such as eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) is that of branching and annihilating random walks in the universality class of directed percolation @xcite .",

    "we ignore this for the moment as we will show in section [ ito ] that it can be easily taken into account _ a posteriori_.    as in equilibrium , one wants to generate , through progressively averaging over fluctuations , a sequence of scale - dependent models , whose effective actions @xmath121 interpolate smoothly between the bare action @xmath122 of the initial model and its effective action @xmath123 , that is , the ( non - equilibriumanalogue of the ) gibbs free energy .",
