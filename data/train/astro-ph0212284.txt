    "while clusters of galaxies are relatively simple dynamical systems that consist of dark matter , stars , and x - ray  emitting hot gas , their thermal evolution is not yet fully understood . this is clearly illustrated by the well - known inconsistency of the observed x - ray luminosity - temperature ( @xmath7-@xmath8 ) relation , @xmath9 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) against the simple self - similar prediction @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "conventionally this is interpreted as evidence for preheating of intracluster gas ; additional heating tends to increase the temperature and the core size of the cluster , and to decrease the central density and the luminosity .",
    "since the effect is stronger for less massive systems , the slope of @xmath7-@xmath8 relation becomes steeper than that of the self - similar prediction @xcite .",
    "in addition , the mass - temperature ( @xmath11-@xmath8 ) relation of clusters is also poorly determined .",
    "although it is conventionally assumed that the gas shock heating is efficient enough and the temperature of the intracluster gas reaches the corresponding virial temperature of the hosting halos , this should be regarded as a simple working hypothesis . nevertheless , the cosmological parameters derived from the cluster abundances are sensitive to the adopted @xmath11-@xmath8 relation . while this has already been recognized for some time ( e.g. , figs.5d and 6d of kitayama & suto 1997 ) , @xcite recently showed in a quantitative manner that the use of the observed @xmath11-@xmath8 relation by @xcite decreases the value of the mass fluctuation amplitude at @xmath12mpc , @xmath6 , by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the hubble constant @xmath15 in units of 100 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 [ we use , however , the dimensionless hubble constant @xmath17 in the following analysis ] .",
    "therefore , the independent derivation of the cluster @xmath11-@xmath8 relation is important both in understanding the thermal history of the intracluster gas and in determining the cosmological parameters .",
    "our primary aim in this paper is to find the @xmath11-@xmath8 relation of clusters that reproduces the observed @xmath7-@xmath8 relation and x - ray temperature function ( xtf ) .",
    "the reason we focus on @xmath11-@xmath8 relation is as follows : since recent @xmath18-body simulations strongly indicate the universality of the density profile of the hosting halos of clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , the intracluster gas density profile in hydrostatic equilibrium with the underlying dark matter can be computed @xcite for a given mass of the halo .",
    "this enables one to make a reliable prediction for the @xmath7-@xmath8 relation once the @xmath11-@xmath8 relation is specified . in turn",
    ", one can obtain the @xmath11-@xmath8 relation that reproduces the observed @xmath7-@xmath8 relation without assuming an ad hoc model for the thermal evolution of intracluster gas .    in what follows ,",
    "we parameterize the @xmath11-@xmath8 relation as a single power law , and derive the best - fit values of their amplitude and slope from the observed @xmath7-@xmath8 relation and the xtf .",
    "the result is compared with the recent observational studies by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also discuss the implications for the value of @xmath6 from cluster abundances . throughout the paper",
    ", we adopt a conventional @xmath2cdm model with density parameter @xmath19 , cosmological constant @xmath20 , dimensionless hubble constant @xmath5 , and baryon density parameter @xmath21 .",
    "we first outline the model of the dark matter halo and the isothermal gas density profile embedded in the halo , which are essential in predicting the x - ray luminosity of clusters as a function of the mass of the hosting halo .",
    "we adopt the specific density profile of dark matter halos of mass @xmath22 , given as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the mean density of the universe at @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the present critical density , @xmath27 is the characteristic density excess , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the virial radius and the scale radius of the halo , respectively . in practice , we focus on two specific profiles : @xmath30 @xcite and @xmath31 , indicated by higher resolution simulations @xcite .    the virial radius @xmath28 is defined according to the spherical collapse model as @xmath32 and the approximation for the critical overdensity @xmath33 can be found in @xcite .",
    "the two parameters @xmath29 and @xmath28 are related via the concentration parameter , @xmath34 in the case of @xmath30 , we use an approximate fitting function with the same functional form as that of @xcite , @xmath35 since the @xmath36-@xmath22 relation has a fairly large intrinsic scatter , we adopt the same value of the power - law index ( @xmath37 ) as indicated by @xcite , but perform our own fit to their figure 4 to determine the value of the coefficient @xmath38 . in fact , the original coefficient given by @xcite does not seem to fit their data , and we find @xmath39 . the quoted errors do not represent the fitting error to the mean relation , but correspond to @xmath40 for the intrinsic distribution around the mean relation . the uncertainty with respect to the adopted power - law index ( @xmath37 ) is effectively included in the above quoted errors for @xmath38 . for @xmath41 ,",
    "we rescale the amplitude of the concentration parameter according to @xcite as @xmath42 .",
    "the condition that the total mass inside @xmath28 is equal to @xmath22 relates @xmath43 to @xmath36 as @xmath44 where @xmath45     & \\alpha=3/2 .",

    "the gas temperature @xmath58 is determined from the @xmath11-@xmath8 relation , as described in detail in ",
    "[ sec : masstemp ] .",
    "the central gas density @xmath59 is computed so that @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the hot gas fraction of baryon mass in the cluster described in  [ sec : fhot ] .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of clusters is computed as @xmath62^{2}r^{2}dr.\\ ] ] in practice , we adopt the bolometric cooling function of @xcite for @xmath63 .",
    "as emphasized in the above , we are mainly interested in the @xmath11-@xmath8 relation of clusters .",
    "most of previous theoretical studies adopted the self - similar relation for the @xmath11-@xmath8 relation : @xmath64 .",
    "recent observations , however , indicate a departure from this relation .",
    "@xcite , for instance , obtained @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the total mass enclosed within the radius @xmath67 at which the mean interior density is @xmath68 times the critical density of the universe , and @xmath69 is the emission - weighted temperature .",
    "@xcite estimated @xmath70 from the observed x - ray luminosity density profile assuming that the gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "similarly @xcite found @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the gas - mass  weighted temperature within @xmath73 ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .    in order to generalize the various choices in the @xmath11-@xmath8 relation",
    ", we adopt the parameterization @xmath74 for reference , the self - similar model @xmath75 with equation  ( [ eq : tvir ] ) corresponds to @xmath76 . since @xmath70 and @xmath77 quoted in equations  ( [ eq : finogu ] ) and ( [ eq : allen ] ) are different from @xmath22 , we translate them to @xmath22 , properly taking into account the dark matter density profiles as described in appendix  [ sec : massconvert ] ( the relations between @xmath66 and @xmath22 for several different values for the overdensity @xmath68 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : f09 ] below ) .",
    "in doing so , we also convert the cluster data at the individual redshifts into those at @xmath78 , taking into account the difference of the hubble parameter at @xmath25 and @xmath15 for our assumed cosmology ( @xmath3 , @xmath20 , and @xmath79 ) .",
    "then we find that the observed samples are well fitted to the relations @xmath80 for @xcite , and @xmath81 for @xcite .",
    "hot gas fraction @xmath61 also plays a central role in predicting the x - ray luminosity of clusters . in many theoretical analyses",
    ", it is often assumed that @xmath61 is independent of the mass of the hosting halos just for simplicity .",
    "of course , this is not a good approximation because the gas in less massive systems is expected to have cooled more efficiently at high redshifts on average , and thus @xmath61 should be a monotonically increasing function of the halo mass .",
    "this qualitative feature is supported by both observations and hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "@xcite , for instance , measured the gas mass fraction within @xmath82 as a function of gas temperature in the range @xmath83 . extrapolating their result to lower temperatures , and assuming for simplicity that the gas mass fraction at the virial radius is equal to that at @xmath82 , we obtain @xmath84.\\ ] ] this is our fiducial model for the hot gas fraction in the present analysis , and for comparison , we also consider a simple model @xmath85 , in which the gas mass fraction is independent of halo mass and gas temperature",
    ".    strictly speaking , we have to convert the value of the gas fraction of @xcite defined at @xmath82 to that at the virial radius . in practice , however , the observational error of the value is significantly larger than the difference of the conversion , and thus we assume here that @xmath86 .",
    "we put an additional condition that the hot gas to baryon fraction in clusters inside their virial radius does not exceed the cosmological baryon fraction for our assumed cosmological parameters ( @xmath3 and @xmath87 ) .",
    "in fact , the observed gas to dark matter fraction has a large scatter ( see fig .",
    "14 of mohr et al . 1999 ) and is consistent with the upper bound that we set here . actually , if we adopt the observational @xmath11-@xmath8 relation of @xcite , we can constrain the gas mass fraction so as to reproduce the observed @xmath7-@xmath8 relation and xtf . as shown in appendix b ,",
    "the resulting constraint is fairly consistent with equation  ( [ eq : fhotobs500 ] ) .",
    "as mentioned above , the simple self - similar model prediction @xmath10 is too shallow to be consistent with the observation ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "this means that heating / cooling processes in addition to the shock heating are important in the thermal evolution of intracluster gas .",
    "apart from the physical mechanism of the additional thermal processes , there are three possibilities that might modify the mass dependence of x - ray luminosity ( see eq .  [ [ eq : lx ] ] ) and steepen the resulting @xmath7-@xmath8 relation .",
    "first , the gas density profile may be significantly flatter for less massive systems .",
    "second , the mass dependence of the hot gas mass fraction is strong as @xmath88 .",
    "finally , the mass - temperature relation is @xmath89 . in practice",
    ", a realistic model should be a combination of those three effects to some extent .",
    "the gas density profile can be specified completely from the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption . as for the hot gas mass fraction , we adopt the observed relation as well as the simple constant fraction",
    ". then the model described in the previous section enables one to compute the x - ray luminosity of a given halo , and to examine whether the observed @xmath7-@xmath8 relation can be reproduced from observed @xmath11-@xmath8 relation and the gas mass fraction .    before doing so ,",
    "let us first look at the @xmath7-@xmath8 relation _ predicted _ from the observed @xmath11-@xmath8 relations ( eqs .",
    "[ [ eq : mtobsfitf ] ] and [ [ eq : mtobsfita ] ] ) and gas mass fraction ( eq .  [ [ eq : fhotobs500 ] ] ) combined with the isothermal gas density profile ( eq .",
    "[ [ eq : rhogas ] ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : f01 ] compares those predictions against 52 x - ray clusters with temperature higher than 2.5  kev from the sample of @xcite ( excluding the two clusters with no reliable estimates for their temperatures ) . for comparison",
    ", we also plot the result for the self - similar model ( eq .  [ [ eq : tvir ] ] ) .",
    "incidentally , we performed all the analysis below both for @xmath30 and @xmath90 , but their difference turns out to be very small .",
    "thus , we show the results for @xmath30 except for the combined contour plot ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : f08 ] below ) .",
    "this clearly illustrates that the predicted @xmath7-@xmath8 relation is very sensitive to the assumed @xmath11-@xmath8 relation ; as is well known , the simple self - similar model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f01 ] , _ dashed line _ ) is inconsistent with the observations by a wide margin . if the halo density profile is well described by equation ( [ eq : nfw ] ) with @xmath91 , the @xmath11-@xmath8 relation of @xcite ( @xcite ; fig .",
    "[ fig : f01 ] , _ dotted line _ ) is in good agreement and that of @xcite ( @xcite ; _ solid line _ ) leads to an acceptable result .",
    "this conclusion in turn indicates that the @xmath7-@xmath8 relation provides a good diagnosis of the underlying @xmath11-@xmath8 relation , which is as yet poorly determined observationally .",
    "therefore , we next attempt to find the range of parameters ( @xmath92 and @xmath93 in eq .",
    "[ [ eq : mtparam ] ] ) which reproduces the observed @xmath7-@xmath8 relation .",
    "as is clear from figure  [ fig : f01 ] , the observed data have intrinsic dispersions .",
    "thus , we first divide the cluster sample in nine temperature bins so that each bin contains five or six clusters .",
    "then we compute the mean temperature , and the mean luminosity and the standard deviation of clusters in each bin .",
    "the results are plotted by open circles with error bars for the luminosity in figure  [ fig : f02 ] .",
    "then we perform a @xmath94 fit to the binned data .",
    "the result is plotted as confidence contours on the @xmath95-@xmath92 plane in figure  [ fig : f03 ] .",
    "we estimate the _ relative _ confidence levels with respect to the best - fit values assuming that @xmath96 follows the @xmath94 distribution of the 2 degrees of freedom ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the best - fit parameters that minimize the value of @xmath94 .",
    "upper and lower panels correspond to the gas mass fraction of @xmath99 and of equation  ( [ eq : fhotobs500 ] ) from @xcite .",
    "the three contour curves represent the 1 , 2 , and 3@xmath100 confidence levels derived from the value of @xmath101 .",
    "crosses show the positions of the best - fit values indicated in each panel . for comparison , we plot the self - similar model prediction , and observational estimates by @xcite and @xcite as open triangles , open circles , and filled circles , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : f03 ] rephrases the visual impression from figure  [ fig : f01 ] in a more quantitative way ; the @xmath11-@xmath8 relation of @xcite is inside the 1@xmath100 contour and that of @xcite is located just outside the 3@xmath100 confidence level , and marginally consistent within the large error - bars .",
    "while the concentration parameter of dark matter halos has a fairly broad distribution corresponding to @xmath102 in equation ( [ eq : c_bullock ] ) , it does not lead to any significant difference ( compare dotted and dot - dashed lines with solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : f03 ] ) .",
    "thus , we fix the proportional constant of the concentration parameter @xmath103 in what follows .",
    "the resulting @xmath7-@xmath8 and @xmath11-@xmath8 relations for the best - fit parameters are plotted in figures  [ fig : f02 ] and [ fig : f04 ] . while our best - fit models actually reproduce the observed @xmath7-@xmath8 relation ( the best - fit value of @xmath94 per degree of freedom is shown in each panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : f03 ] ) , they also seem to be in reasonable agreement with the _ observed _ @xmath11-@xmath8 relation .",
    "one can also infer the empirical shape of the @xmath11-@xmath8 relation from the requirement that it reproduces the observed xtf of clusters . comparing with that from the @xmath7-@xmath8 relation",
    ", this methodology provides a fairly ( even if not entirely ) independent constraint on the @xmath11-@xmath8 relation , mainly in two important aspects : ( 1 ) the model dependence on the density profile enters only through the flux limit , @xmath104 , of the observed sample , and ( 2 ) the prediction , on the other hand , is sensitive to the adopted mass function of dark matter halos , and therefore to the value of @xmath6 in particular ( remember that we fix the other cosmological parameters in the present analysis ) .    for this purpose , we again use the 54 x - ray clusters with temperature higher than 2.5  kev from the sample of @xcite .",
    "the corresponding flux limit is @xmath105 erg s@xmath16 @xmath106 in the ( 0.12.4 )  kev band , and the total sky coverage is @xmath107 sr . for definiteness",
    ", we adopt the gas mass fraction given by equation  ( [ eq : fhotobs500 ] ) . as for the halo mass function ,",
    "we adopt both an analytic model by @xcite and a fitting model to the numerical simulations by @xcite , @xmath108 we define the rms variance of linear density field @xmath109 as @xmath110 k^{2}dk,\\ ] ] where @xmath111 and @xmath112 is the linear power spectrum .",
    "we perform the @xmath94 fit to the data with respect to the three free parameters : @xmath92 and @xmath93 in equation  ( [ eq : mtparam ] ) , and @xmath6 .    in order to avoid uncertainties in constructing the conventional xtf data ( e.g. , the definition of @xmath113 as discussed by @xcite ) , we directly use the number count of clusters with the flux limit @xmath104 per unit solid angle of the sky , appropriated binned according to their temperatures . in practice , we divide both the data and our predictions into five temperature bins ( 2.53.6 , 3.65.0 , 5.06.4 , 6.48.0 , and @xmath1148.0 kev ) , so that the errors do not correlate with one another , and perform the @xmath94 fit .",
    "we assign the poisson error to the number count in each bin .",
    "the result is plotted as confidence contours on the @xmath95-@xmath115 plane in figure  [ fig : f05 ] .",
    "again we estimate the _ relative _ confidence levels with respect to the best - fit values assuming that @xmath116 follows the @xmath94 distribution of the 2 degrees of freedom , where @xmath97 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the best - fit parameters that minimize the value of @xmath94 , and @xmath119 is the value of @xmath6 minimizing the @xmath94 with given @xmath93 , and @xmath115 .",
    "upper and lower panels of figure  [ fig : f05 ] correspond to the mass functions of @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the three solid contour curves represent the 1 , 2 , and 3@xmath100 confidence levels derived from the @xmath94 fit , with the filled squares indicating the points of the highest significance .",
    "dotted contours , on the other hand , indicate the best - fit value of @xmath6 at the given location on the @xmath95-@xmath115 plane . the self - similar model prediction , and observational estimates by @xcite and @xcite , are plotted by open triangles , open circles , and filled circles , respectively .",
    "the upper panel in figure  [ fig : xtf_bestmt ] illustrates that the best - fit model reproduces the observed xtf nicely .",
    "again just for comparison , we plot the self - similar model predictions , which do not fit the observed xtf at all .",
    "moreover , the lower panel indicates that the degree of fit is indeed sensitive to the value of @xmath6 ; the best - fit value is 0.70.8 .",
    "although the above conclusion may seem inconsistent with the previous claims ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) that the self - similar model does fit the observed xtf with @xmath120 , it can be explained by the following reasons .",
    "first , the previous xtf data had much larger errors and thus still allowed a wider range of theoretical models .",
    "second , the latest xtf data that we adopted have a systematically smaller amplitude at @xmath121kev than the previous ones ( see fig",
    ".  6 of * ? ? ?",
    "third , the adopted @xmath7-@xmath8 relation is different ; our current self - similar model corresponds to @xmath122 , while the previous analyses used ( sometimes implicitly ) @xmath123 to construct the `` observed '' xtf data via the conventional @xmath113 method ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". finally , the recent mass function of @xcite predicts more massive halos than that of @xcite , which has been widely used in the previous analyses .",
    "figure  [ fig : xtf_ssmt5 ] demonstrates the above features . for a direct comparison with the analyses of @xcite",
    ", we adopt @xmath124 and the @xmath7-@xmath8 relation from equation ( 3 ) of @xcite , with their fiducial choice for the other parameters .",
    "the goodness of the fit turns out to be significantly degraded compared to the previous result , mainly because of the systematically smaller amplitude of the xtf , as well as reduced error bars .",
    "nevertheless , this methodology fully reproduces the best - fit value of @xmath120 , as in the previous one .",
    "in fact , the combination of those effects also explains why the reanalysis of the cluster abundance by @xcite yielded @xmath125 in the standard @xmath2cdm model when adopting the @xmath11-@xmath8 relation of @xcite .",
    "incidentally , the smaller value of @xmath6 seems consistent with the recent joint analysis of cosmic microwave background and large - scale structure @xcite , which suggests @xmath126 .",
    "we have presented the constraints on the ( empirically parameterized ) mass - temperature relation of galaxy clusters from the two different observational data , the luminosity - temperature relation and the temperature function .",
    "we summarize in figure  [ fig : f08 ] our constraints on the @xmath127-@xmath115 plane , adopting the observed gas mass fraction ( eq .  [ [ eq : fhotobs500 ] ] ) .",
    "the fact that the simple self - similar evolution model @xmath128 fails to explain the observed @xmath7-@xmath8 relation is well known and not at all new .",
    "rather , it should be noted that the mass - temperature relation of galaxy clusters is fairly well constrained by combining the observed @xmath7-@xmath8 relation and xtf .",
    "it is encouraging that @xmath129 barely satisfy the two constraints simultaneously .",
    "this conclusion applies for @xmath130 as long as the dark halo density profile is described by equation ( [ eq : nfw ] ) .",
    "in addition , our analysis implies that the amplitude of the mass variance @xmath6 in the standard @xmath2cdm model should be 0.70.8 .",
    "these values are significantly smaller than the previous estimates @xcite but in better agreement with more recent results @xcite .",
    "since our current analysis has adopted a simple parameterized model for the mass - temperature relation , the result should be understood by a physical model of the thermal evolution of the intracluster gas .",
    "for instance , our result may be qualitatively explained by a kind of phenomenological heating of @xmath131kev . we plan to examine the implications for the possible heating sources from the derived mass - temperature relation of galaxy clusters using the monte - carlo modeling of merger trees .",

    "thus , if @xmath140 is given , one can compute @xmath67 and @xmath141 from the following relation @xmath142 figure  [ fig : f09 ] plots @xmath141 ( _ upper panels _ ) and @xmath67 ( _ lower panels _ ) for several choices of @xmath68 .",
    "the strategy that we have adopted in the present paper is to determine the permitted parameter region of the @xmath11-@xmath8 relation of clusters from the @xmath7-@xmath8 relation and xtf , _ assuming _ a specific model for the hot gas mass fraction @xmath143 inspired by the observation . in principle , however , we may repeat the similar procedure and derive the constraints on @xmath144 , assuming the observed @xmath11-@xmath8 relation instead . since the observational uncertainty for the hot gas mass fraction ( eq .  [ [ eq : fhotobs500 ] ] ) that we adopted is fairly large , this approach is useful in understanding the dependence of our conclusion on the model for the gas mass fraction .    for this purpose ,",
    "we also parameterize the gas mass fraction by a single power law , @xmath145 and perform the @xmath94 fit to the @xmath7-@xmath8 relation varying the two free parameters , @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "we repeat the similar fitting xtf with @xmath146 , @xmath148 and @xmath6 .",
    "the result is plotted in figure  [ fig : f10 ] , where we use the observed @xmath11-@xmath8 relation of @xcite .",
    "solid contour curves represent the 1 , 2 , and 3@xmath100 confidence levels derived from the @xmath94 fit to the @xmath7-@xmath8 relation , while dotted curves show the 1 , 2 , and 3@xmath100 confidence levels from the xtf .",
    "clearly , both constraints again are simultaneously satisfied for @xmath149 , and in fact agree with the observed gas mass fraction of @xcite .",
    "we also plot the condition that @xmath150 by a dashed line , so that the hot gas fraction does not exceed the cosmological average of the baryon fraction ( assuming that @xmath151 and @xmath3 ) .",
    "if this condition should be satisfied , the acceptable parameter range almost exactly corresponds to the observed gas mass fraction of @xcite ."
