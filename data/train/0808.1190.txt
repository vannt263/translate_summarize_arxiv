    "restricted open - shell theory @xcite and in particular restricted open - shell kohn - sham theory ( roks ) @xcite has gained renewed interest in recent years due to its application in the simulation of photoreactions @xcite . while the concept of restricted open - shell theory is seemingly simple , only part of the states of interest are accessible in present implementations .",
    "for the high - spin case ( multiplicity = number of unpaired electrons + 1 ) the situation is simple : only one slater determinant is needed for the description of the wavefunction .",
    "the most trivial case is the one with but one unpaired electron which gives rise to a doublet that is described by a single determinant in a straightforward way . for most single - determinant cases ,",
    "results very similar to the unrestricted theory are obtained and the use of the restricted theory is not necessary . for low - spin cases the situation is much more involved and from a purely mathematical view one might doubt if these cases can be analysed at all .",
    "one of the general criticisms concerning open - shell theory has already been addressed by roothaan in his original restricted open - shell hartree - fock ( rohf ) paper @xcite : he showed that although orbital - dependent operators are obtained , the equations can be augmented to a hermitean formulation by the use of projection operators .",
    "this guarantees diagonalization to real eigenvalues . for low - spin cases",
    "there is the additional problem of orbital rotations leading to unphysical localization which has also been noted as sudden polarization in related approaches @xcite , and there is a lot of confusion in the literature due to the difficulty in correctly interpreting and avoiding this phenomenon of unphysical orbital localization .",
    "undesired rotations can in be avoided by exploiting spatial symmetry or by state averaging ; general self - consistent solutions for the restricted open - shell problem are difficult to achieve @xcite . in recent years",
    "we have shown for the case of restricted open - shell kohn - sham theory , that by proper modification of the off - diagonal elements of the kohn - sham matrix these localizations can even be avoided in self - consistent calculations for first - principles molecular dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "the parameters used in these algorithms are case dependent ( localized / delocalized situations ) ; up to now no unique approach exists that would efficiently converge to the correct solution for all cases . finally , if one wants to use kohn - sham instead of hartree - fock expressions , there is the question how the energy expression for a multi - determinant approach should be determined . in roks",
    "@xcite we use the energy expression as proposed in the sum method @xcite .",
    "this expression reduces to the rohf terms if it is used with the exact energy expectation values of the open - shell slater determinants , instead of inserting the kohn - sham expressions .",
    "+ practical roks dynamics calculations are presently restricted to the case of two unpaired electrons which is by far the most important case for the description of photoreactions .",
    "this restriction has several reasons : 1 .",
    "while the concept is clear , there is , to our knowledge , no explicit formulation of the energy expression for arbitrary low spin states in the kohn - sham literature .",
    "2 . based on an energy expression ,",
    "single - electron roks equations have to be derived for the particular spin densities involved .",
    "algorithms for the self - consistent solution of the equations for n electrons must be developed and tested . in the present paper , we address points 1 and 2 .",
    "+ we simplify the derivation , which corresponds to deriving an energy expression for a spin - adapted configuration , by neglecting the possibility of symmetry - determined degeneracy as it may be present in atoms ( @xmath0=0 $ ] ) or in diatomic molecules ( @xmath1=0 $ ] ) .",
    "the treatment of such highly symmetric systems hardly plays a role in molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "instead we use the occupation pattern as a symmetry like suggested in a similar way by the work of ziegler , rauk and baerends @xcite , daul @xcite , and noodleman @xcite . on this basis",
    "it is possible to compute , for example not only the lowest singlet state , but the singlet states with zero , two , and so on , unpaired electrons .",
    "( note that the singlet state with zero unpaired electrons is not necessarily the lowest one . ) in calculations based on the sum method , in addition to the occupation pattern high spatial symmetry was exploited for the computation of multiplets in the context of ligand field theory ( see @xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "we do not make use of radial or cylindrical symmetry ( or of approximate radial symmetry , if a central metal atom is in an environment ) .",
    "this means that for example , for two unpaired p electrons we can not compute @xmath2d , @xmath3d , @xmath2p , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , but just t@xmath7 and s@xmath7 .",
    "higher states are only accessible as local minima .",
    "ignoring the fact that an atom might be in an environment with a particular symmetry seems appropriate for reactive molecular dynamics simulations , where the spatial symmetry and the degree of degeneracy should be free to change at any time .",
    "note that the restriction of not treating symmetry - determined degeneracy explicitly , does not mean that degeneracy can not be described at all .",
    "it just means that degeneracy is determined at the single - configuration level - which may turn out to be wrong in comparison with a multi - configuration approach .",
    "+ in the next section , the energy expression for n unpaired electrons is derived . in the following two sections , first the general form of the roks operators for n electrons is given and then the explicit symmetry determined parameters of these operators are specified for up to five unpaired electrons .",
