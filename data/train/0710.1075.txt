    "an atomic @xmath0 system with zeeman sublevels of the ground state , which are sufficiently long lived to store qubits , plays a very important role in quantum computations .",
    "superpositions of such states can store quantum information for sufficiently long time to make various quantum algorithms feasible  @xcite .",
    "therefore , researchers frequently consider such states in their proposals  @xcite and use them in their experiments  @xcite .",
    "access to a good quantum memory is necessary , but not sufficient , to realize quantum computation .",
    "it is also important to be able to perform quantum operations on such coded qubits with high fidelity differing from unity by @xmath5 or less  @xcite .",
    "although there is no direct , strong coupling between the zeeman sublevels , one can efficiently manipulate populations of the states using the two - photon raman transition involving an auxiliary level , for example , state @xmath6 in the @xmath0 configuration , as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "this method of qubit encoding and manipulation has many different implementations .",
    "there are single atoms or ions modeled by different level configuration systems : a three - level @xmath0 system  @xcite , a four - level system with three levels in @xmath0 configuration , and one additional long - lived level , which does not participate in the transition  @xcite , a six - level double @xmath0 system , which consists of two @xmath0 systems behaving exactly in parallel  @xcite .",
    "there are also solid - state implementations : quantum dots modeled by the @xmath0-type  @xcite three - level system and superconducting quantum interference devices modeled by the @xmath0-type three - level system  @xcite . in all these systems",
    "it is easy to store qubits and it is easy to perform single qubit gates just by turning the lasers on and off , to drive transitions for a proper period of time .",
    "moreover , @xmath0-type systems are also perfect to realize the multiple qubit gates , as for example the crucial for quantum computation controlled not gate  @xcite , because one can place two or more such systems in a microcavity and couple one transition in each @xmath0-type structure to the cavity field mode .",
    "then , qubit interactions are mediated by the cavity field mode .",
    "another way to realize two qubit gates is to perform the joint detection of photons leaking out of two separate cavities with trapped @xmath0-type systems  @xcite .",
    "since there are many advantages of devices composed of @xmath0-type systems and cavities , such systems are very popular elements of various quantum information processing schemes .",
    "however , there is one important drawback of such schemes  the population transferred to the intermediate level diminishes the fidelity of quantum operations performed with them . to avoid the destructive effect of populating the intermediate level",
    ", one can decide to work in the decoherence - free space  @xcite or , alternatively , one can assume that the cavity mode and the laser fields are far detuned from their respective transitions , as to make the population of the intermediate state negligible .",
    "the latter approach is referred to as adiabatic elimination . in realistic situations with not extremely large values of detunings , the population of the intermediate level is small but noticeable enough to significantly deteriorate the quality of quantum operations .",
    "-type raman transition : a key ingredient of different quantum devices.,width=188 ]    in this paper , we propose a scheme for fine tuning of the quantum operations performed via raman transitions in the atomic @xmath0 system driven on one transition by a classical field , and on the other by a quantum cavity field .",
    "we discuss the conditional evolution of the @xmath0 system in a situation when the adiabatic elimination is not made , and we show that it is possible to take advantage of the fact that the intermediate state population oscillates rapidly , periodically approaching zero , which can be used to improve the quality of quantum gates based on the raman transitions in the @xmath0 system .",
    "it turns out that it is possible , by setting appropriate values for the detuning , to make the population of the intermediate state negligible at the time the quantum operation is completed , and in this way we are able to increase significantly the fidelity of the operation .",
    "such fine tuning of the quantum operations works well even for small detunings and , therefore , it can prove useful when one wants to perform quantum operations with high fidelity .",
    "we have found a discrete set of detunings for which perfect operations are possible if there is no damping .",
    "we have also found approximate analytical solutions describing the evolution of the @xmath0 system including both the cavity damping and spontaneous emission .",
    "numerical results for higher values of the cavity decay rate and spontaneous emission rate show , somewhat unexpectedly , that the spontaneous emission can play a stabilizing role improving the result of quantum operation when the cavity decay rate becomes sufficiently large .",
    "we shortly address the issue of fine tuning for the nonrectangular pulses .",
    "let us consider two basic operations , which can be performed on qubit - encoding states of the @xmath0-type level structures : the @xmath1 pulse operation and the @xmath2 pulse operation .",
    "these two basic operations can be used to realize a number of important quantum information tasks as , for example , generation of maximally entangled states  @xcite , quantum information transfer  @xcite , or the performing of controlled two qubit gates  @xcite .",
    "we consider an atom in @xmath0 configuration trapped in a cavity .",
    "the long - lived states @xmath7 and @xmath8 of the atom are coupled via the intermediate level @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lv ] ) .",
    "the @xmath9 transition is coupled to the cavity mode with a frequency @xmath10 and coupling strength @xmath11 .",
    "the second transition is driven by a classical laser field with the coupling strength @xmath12 .",
    "the frequency of the laser field is @xmath13 .",
    "both the classical laser field and the quantized cavity mode are detuned from the corresponding transition frequencies by @xmath14 .",
    "the population transfer between long - lived states @xmath7 and @xmath8 take place only when both transitions @xmath9 and @xmath15 are driven .",
    "therefore , the qubit is safe if the laser is turned off .",
    "if we want to perform the @xmath1 pulse operation or the @xmath2 pulse operation then all we need to do is turning the laser on for a proper period of time .",
    "the evolution of the @xmath0-type quantum systems is determined by the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian ( we set @xmath16 here and in the following ) : @xmath17 where @xmath4 is the spontaneous emission rate from the atomic state @xmath6 , and @xmath3 is the cavity decay rate . in expression  ( [ eq : hamiltonian0l ] ) we also introduce the flip operators @xmath18 , where .",

    "it is evident from  ( [ eq:5 ] ) that the excited atomic state population shows oscillatory behavior .",
    "since the qubit is coded into the lower states , the fidelity of quantum operations performed on the qubit is reduced when some amount of population is present in the intermediate level . to overcome this problem ,",
    "the upper level is usually adiabatically eliminated by choosing the detuning so large as to make the intermediate state population negligible .",
    "there is , however , an important drawback of this approach  it is necessary to use very large values of the detuning to achieve fidelities of the quantum operations sufficient for quantum computation .",
    "it would require @xmath39 to get the fidelity different from unity by amount smaller than @xmath5 .",
    "such detunings lead to long operation times , which are very challenging for optical cavities .    here",

    ", we understand a unitary operation transforming a given initial state into another ( desired ) quantum state . the quantum operation is perfect if the desired state is produced with the fidelity equal to unity .",

    "the periodicity appears when the two frequencies @xmath59 , given by  ( [ eq:1 ] ) , are commensurate , i.e. , their ratio is a ratio of integers . taking absolute values of the two frequencies we can distinguish between the `` fast '' @xmath60 and `` slow '' @xmath61 frequency , where @xmath62 from  ( [ eq:7 ] ) and  ( [ eq:10 ] ) it is easy to check that the frequencies @xmath61 , @xmath60 , and @xmath63 are all commensurate , so the evolution is periodic .",

    "of course , transparency of the mirror leads to a damping of the cavity field mode .",

    "the situation is thus more complex than for the rectangular pulses discussed in previous sections . nevertheless , even in this case",
    "the idea of fine tuning is useful for finding the operation time .",
    "we illustrate the problem with few examples .",

    "the normalization to the same pulse area ensures , on resonance , the same final state at time @xmath187 after the pulse for different pulse shapes .",
    "the sine square pulse shape is given by the function ( normalized to the same area ) @xmath190    the two pulse shapes are of different character .",
    "the trapezium is close to the rectangle when the rise and fall times are short .",
    "the sine square pulse is much narrower and changes smoothly over the whole duration time @xmath187 . for the rectangle pulse",

    "we replace the oscillation frequency @xmath155 of the intermediate state population with an `` average frequency '' @xmath192 where @xmath193 which gives @xmath194 with @xmath195 given by  ( [ eq:34 ] ) . applying such a replacement we can calculate the `` period '' @xmath67 using  ( [ eq:16 ] ) and the time @xmath65 for the considered operation using @xmath48 defined by  ( [ eq:12 ] ) .",
    "the pulse is characterized by one parameter  the mean square amplitude defined by  ( [ eq:37 ] ) . for pulses with smooth rise and fall times ,",
    "the evolution is no longer periodic , so the time @xmath67 is not really the period , but for small values of @xmath46 ( @xmath196 ) , the time @xmath65 calculated in this way is still a good approximation for the optimal operation time .",

    "the fidelity , assuming the pulse duration @xmath200 , is equal to @xmath202 for the trapezium pulse and to @xmath203 for the sine square pulse .",
