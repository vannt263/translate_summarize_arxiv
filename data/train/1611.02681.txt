    "the essence of the phenomenon of anderson localization @xcite is conventionally understood in terms of spatial localization of a quantum particle by disorder in the absence of interactions of the particle with other particles , or any other degrees of freedom in the system for that matter .",
    "a key feature of anderson localization is the sharp boundary between continua of localized and delocalized single - particle states , as the particle energy is varied . for a macroscopic noninteracting electron system , this means a quantum phase transition at temperature @xmath0 , namely the anderson transition between the metallic and insulating phases , with changing , e.g. , fermi energy .",
    "localization theory has been under intensive development up until recently , culminating in a rich variety of the universality classes of the anderson transition depending on the underlying symmetries and topologies  @xcite . for the generic case of a random scalar potential ,",
    "however , all single - particle states , independently of their energy , are localized for @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the space dimension , and ( in the absence of a magnetic field leading to the quantum hall effect or the spin - orbit coupling ) for @xmath3 , the latter being the lower critical dimensionality for the metal - insulator transition for this type of disorder .",
    "the key question in this area is how the inelastic transitions due to electron - electron interactions affect anderson localization at nonzero @xmath4 .",
    "more specifically , one may wonder about the resulting @xmath4 dependence of the electrical conductivity @xmath5 in the phase that is insulating at zero @xmath4 .",
    "it was about a third of a century ago that two important advances were made in order to answer the latter question .",
    "on the one hand , it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that short - range interactions in a disordered system with localized single - particle states do not destroy localization also at nonzero @xmath4 , implying that @xmath6 in the absence of a zero-@xmath4 mobility edge , at least in the strongly disordered limit .",
    "the reasoning was based on a perturbation series analysis of the tentative single - particle decay through the excitation of localized particle - hole pairs .    on the other hand ,",
    "it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that inelastic electron - electron scattering in the weakly disordered limit leads to a finite dephasing rate and thus to a nonzero @xmath7 , even for the case of @xmath8 where all single - particle states are localized .",
    "the calculation rested on a self - consistent description of nyquist noise produced by delocalized electrons .",
    "the latter approach offered an appealing picture of the weak - localization limit for disordered fermi liquids @xcite .",
    "assuming that the two arguments  @xcite , taken at face value , are correct , a disordered interacting system with localized single - particle states must undergo a finite-@xmath4 localization - delocalization transition with changing strength of disorder . if disorder is not too strong ( the condition relevant to lattice models ) , the localization - delocalization transition must also occur as @xmath4 is changed .",
    "in other words , at certain finite @xmath4 , inelastic scattering due to electron - electron interactions should lead to a delocalization ( `` many - body delocalization '' ) of electrons that are localized in the absence of interactions . at that time , however , and up until the last decade , this logical construction , although obviously having fundamental theoretical implications , was not commonly appreciated as an essential part of the conceptual framework for disorder - induced phase transitions .",
    "important early ideas in this direction ( in particular , the very possibility of a finite-@xmath4 localization - delocalization transition ) were put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "interest in the problem was revived in the context of anderson localization in fock space .",
    "the concept of viewing higher - order electron - electron scattering as the anderson localization problem on a certain graph ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) in fock space was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite with the aim to study the hybridization of a highly excited single - particle state , as a function of its energy , in a quantum dot .",
    "this concept has become a central element in subsequent developments , see ref .",
    "@xcite for the recent overview .    while ref .",
    "@xcite dealt with a closed zero - dimensional system , subsequent works addressed the problem of localization in a spatially extended many - body system at finite @xmath4 , with one of the goals being to resolve the dichotomy between the early results of refs .",

    "two papers  @xcite , studying the interaction - induced decay of a single - particle state for the short - ranged interaction in the spirit of refs .",

    "both papers  @xcite arrived at the conclusion that there is a finite-@xmath4 localization - delocalization transition , with @xmath7 being zero on the low-@xmath4 side of the transition and nonzero on the other side .",
    "the result was obtained by means of a mapping on the bethe - lattice problem in the vicinity of the transition in ref .",
    "@xcite and a self - consistent treatment of the perturbation series in ref .  @xcite .",
    "signatures of a many - body localization - delocalization transition in interacting systems were observed experimentally in indium - oxide films  @xcite as well as in a @xmath1 system of fermionic atoms placed in two incommensurate optical lattices  @xcite and in a @xmath3 system of cold bosonic atoms  @xcite .",
    "many - body localization was studied experimentally also in arrays of coupled one - dimensional optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to revisit the scaling of the position of the many - body delocalization transition ( in terms of a critical strength of disorder or a critical temperature ) with the strength of ( weak ) interaction in a broad class of models specified in sec .",

    "the position of the many - body delocalization transition in many - body systems is a highly nontrivial problem .",
    "indeed , a naive thouless criterion that compares a matrix element with the level spacing of directly coupled states may be very deceptive .",
    "for example , in an extended system with localized single - particle states the level spacing of many - body states coupled to a given typical many - body state is inversely proportional to the system volume @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the linear size of the system . employing the above naive criterion",
    ", one would arrive at the conclusion that in the thermodynamic limit @xmath11 all many - body states are extended for an arbitrary weak ( but finite ) interaction and at arbitrary low temperature @xmath12 , in contradiction with refs .",
    "a problem with the above naive argumentation becomes particularly obvious if one notices that it could be also applied to the situation in which different localization volumes are fully decoupled , and thus many - body states are definitely localized .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , as a solution to this problem , it was proposed to consider single - particle excitations . specifically , following essentially the arguments of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , the criterion for the many - body localization - delocalization transition was identified ( up to a logarithmic factor ) by comparing the typical interaction matrix element with the typical level spacing of final ( three - particle : two electrons and a hole ) states for the decay of a single - electron excitation .",
    "the obtained position of the transition was determined by the critical condition for a bethe lattice  @xcite in fock space  @xcite .    while the approches used in refs .",
    "@xcite were different , the results for the transition temperature @xmath13 are the same , up to a numerical prefactor , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent detailed discussion .",

    "in particular , in refs .  @xcite and @xcite , the importance of spectral diffusion for delocalization of collective excitations was emphasized .",
    "the essence of the spectral diffusion is that transitions that take place in a many - body system shift resonant conditions for other transitions .",
    "recently , it was shown that the spectral diffusion plays an essential role in determining the scaling of the many - body delocalization transition in a finite system with power - law interactions @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite where manifestations of spectral diffusion in this context were observed experimentally ) .",
    "the aim of the present work is to show that a similar mechanism leads to enhancement of many - body delocalization in quantum dots and in extended systems with short - range interaction , and to determine the correct scaling of the delocalization thresholds .    on the technical level , refs .",
    "@xcite neglected diagonal ( in the single - particle basis ) terms of the interaction , retaining only matrix elements of interaction with all four indices being distinct . the usual argument behind this approximation refers to the hartree - fock basis that includes such diagonal terms on the single - particle level .",
    "we will show below , however , that such an approximation is , in fact , too naive : the spectral diffusion driven by such matrix elements changes the localization - delocalization threshold parametrically .",
    "when addressing extended systems in this work , we consider a model with finite - range interaction . at the same time , while in one - dimensional systems , the relevant matrix elements of the long - range coulomb interaction is expected to be effectively short - ranged , in higher - dimensional ( 2d and 3d ) systems , the coulomb interaction was shown to lead to the delocalization of excitations at arbitrary temperatures @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the delocalization occurs when the spatial dimensionality exceeds the half of the exponent of the power - law decay of random long - range interactions .",

    "to summarize , we have shown that taking into account the spectral diffusion , which originates from diagonal matrix elements of the interaction , parametrically enhances the delocalization threshold in many - body systems .",
    "this happens both in quantum - dot models and in spatially extended models with localized single - particle states . in particular , in an electronic system of the latter type , the critical temperature @xmath13 of the delocalization transition scales with the interaction strength @xmath48 according to ( eq .  [ tc12 ] ) , which is parametrically lower than the previous result ( [ tc - ext - nsd ] ) of refs .",
    "@xcite .    before closing , let us discuss some further implications of our work as well as directions for future research .",
    "\\(i ) our analysis shows that the localization transitions in quantum - dot many - body problems have a lot of similarity to those in tight - binding models on tree - like graphs , such as rrg @xcite and sparse random - matrix @xcite models .",
    "the essential difference is in the fact that for the effective tight - binding model of quantum dot there are small loops [ e.g. , performing the processes @xmath225 and @xmath226 in opposite order results in the same state ] and that the corresponding amplitudes partially cancel .",
    "this cancelation affects the analysis of logarithmic corrections to the scaling of the delocalization threshold , see sec .",
    "[ s3a4 ] . at the present stage ,",
    "we are only able to give boundaries , eq .",
    "( [ estimate - mu ] ) , for the power of the logarithm @xmath143 in the scaling law , eq .",
    "( [ nc - log - mu ] ) . an accurate determination of @xmath143 remains an important research prospect .",
    "further , it would be interesting to study whether ( and , if yes , then how ) the above difference between the quantum - dot problem and the rrg affects also the critical behavior at the transition",
    ". in particular , one can study the scaling of the wave function statistics ( inverse participation ratios ) , and the level statistics in the quantum - dot problem , at criticality and near the transition .",
    "\\(ii ) the problem of exact determination of the power of the logarithmic factor in the scaling of the threshold applies also to spatially extended models with localized single - particle states , see a comment below eq .",
    "( [ tc12 ] ) .",
    "clearly , the scaling of observables at and near the transition in this class of many - body systems is of great interest as well .",
    "three of us have argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , by using a relation of the delocalization of a quasiparticle excitation by `` ballistic '' paths to the bethe lattice , that the quasiparticle relaxation rate and the conductivity scale near critical point as @xmath227.\\ ] ] while the spectral diffusion modifies @xmath13 , it does not seem to affect the argument in favor of this scaling . indeed , for a spatially extended system , the @xmath133-dependence of the @xmath133-th order effective matrix element for a quasiparticle decay remains for large @xmath133 the same as in the bethe - lattice problem also with spectral diffusion taken into account . clearly , the above argument is not rigorous since it discards other contributions to the quasiparticle decay .",
    "a rigorous derivation of the critical behavior in a many - body problem remains an outstanding challenge for future research .",
    "it is worth mentioning that an experimental evidence in favor of an exponential vanishing of the conductivity at the threshold was recently obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite in a 2d system on the localized side of the superconductor - insulator transition .",
    "\\(iii ) several numerical studies of 1d systems have reported a subdiffusive transport on the delocalized side of the transition @xcite .",
    "the existence of such a phase has been ascribed to rare ( griffiths - type ) events @xcite .",
    "an important question is whether this subdiffusive phase really exists in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "recent work @xcite observed a substantial flow of the corresponding fractal dimension with the system size ( in a certain analogy with ref .",
    "@xcite for rrg ) , which suggests that the thermodynamic - limit behavior might differ essentially from the one observed numerically in relatively small systems .",
    "signatures of many - body localization were also studied in systems without quenched disorder  @xcite . a distinction between the models with and without quenched disorder in the problem of many - body localization",
    "was emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite . in a related line of reasoning ,",
    "it was conjectured in refs .",
    "@xcite that the rare events of the `` hot bubble '' type may destroy the many - body localized phase .",
    "it is interesting to note that the rare events were argued to lead both to suppression and to enhancement of localization , see discussion in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "it remains an open issue to understand whether the rare - region effects of both types can be captured within the scheme developed in the present work , with the spectral diffusion included .",
    "\\(iv ) a verification of the analytical predictions for the scaling of the many - body localization threshold by means of numerical simulations would be of great interest .",
    "several papers addressed this scaling in the framework of the electronic quantum - dot problem fifteen to twenty years ago @xcite with contradictory conclusions .",
    "clearly , exploring somewhat larger systems would be favorable for a clear identification of the power - law exponent .",
    "also , it would be probably easier to distinguish between different types of scaling in the spin - quantum - dot model formulated in sec .",
    "[ s2c ] .    in the case of spatially extended models , phase diagrams in the interaction - disorder plane",
    "have been established numerically in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "while a determination of the scaling of the critical disorder with interaction strength has not been attempted in these works , it appears to be feasible ( although clearly not simple ) .",
    "as an approach complementary to exact diagonalization , a numerical evaluation of a sum over forward - approximation paths @xcite might be used for this purpose .",
    "\\(v ) it is worth emphasizing that , when considering spatially extended systems in this work , we assumed ( following refs .",
    "@xcite ) that the single - particle localization length may be considered as an energy - independent quantity .",
    "this approximation is clearly justified if one considers a lattice model with an energy somewhere in the middle part of the band . on the other hand , for systems defined in a spatial continuum , one encounters a situation in which there are states with arbitrarily big single - particle localization length ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for the discussion of many - body localization in systems with energy - dependent single - particle localization length ) .",
    "of course , these are highly excited states whose thermal occupation is exponentially low , so that their effect is not clear a priori and has to be carefully investigated .",
    "an analysis shows  @xcite that scattering between thermal and high - energy states eliminates the finite - temperature many - body localization transition , rendering many - body states delocalized in the thermodynamic limit at arbitrarily low ( but still non - zero ) temperature .",
    "in such a situation , the critical temperature identified in the present work will become a crossover temperature below which the conductivity tends to zero in a faster - than - activation fashion .",
