    "doped and undoped manganese oxides , such as r@xmath6a@xmath7mno@xmath8 , where r denotes a rare earth and a an alkaline earth , have a very complex phase diagram  @xcite depending on temperature , doping , ionic radius of the involved elements or magnetization .",
    "they have been thoroughly investigated because of the cmr effect and have been found to have a rich phase diagram including ferromagnetic ( fm ) , antiferromagnetic ( afm ) , insulating , metallic and charge ordered states .",
    "quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems with well separated mno@xmath9-(bi)layers exist .",
    "a comprehensive understanding of their properties certainly requires treatment of the phononic degrees of freedom and of the orbital degeneracy including coulomb repulsion , which however would pose overwhelming difficulties , especially in more than one dimension .",
    "the much simpler fm kondo lattice model  @xcite captures some of the properties of these materials , namely the hopping of the itinerant manganese @xmath10 electrons via the intermediate oxygen ions ( double exchange ) and their strong hund s rule coupling to the @xmath11 corespin formed by the localized manganese @xmath12 electrons .",
    "an additional antiferromagnetic coupling between the corespins is often included to account for superexchange of the @xmath12 electrons . even for this model ,",
    "full quantum mechanical calculations are difficult in more than one dimension , and it has therefore been proposed to replace the @xmath12 corespin by a classical spin .",
    "@xcite while this approximation has been criticized ,  @xcite it has been shown to yield good results at low but finite temperatures .",
    "@xcite as the ferromagnetic coupling @xmath13 of the itinerant electrons to the corespins is far larger than the hopping strength or the antiferromagnetic superexchange @xmath0 , energy scales can be separated and the model can thereby be considerably simplified . in the customary @xmath14 approach and in the second order",

    "double occupancies are thus suppressed and coulomb repulsion is usually neglected .",
    "the fm kondo lattice model with classical corespins has been extensively investigated .",

    "two - orbital models have been treated , mainly with classical phonons but without coulomb repulsion .",

    "@xcite stripes were reported in a kondo model applied to cuprates with different parameter values.@xcite    in previous papers,@xcite we have studied the one - dimensional model by monte carlo techniques similar to those used before .",
    "careful analysis of the data showed , however , that instead of phase separation there are independent small fm polarons .",

    "a thorough examination of a variety of observables showed that , like in 1d , there is no phase separation but holes enter the system by forming independent fm polarons with a single hole inside .    in the present paper we provide a phase diagram of the two - dimensional model as a function of corespin coupling @xmath0 and hole doping up to @xmath18 .",
    "we thoroughly examine the transition from the polaronic to the homogeneous ferromagnetic phase . at moderate to large @xmath0",

    "polarons are favored over phase separation by entropy , and their dependence on temperature is therefore of interest .",
    "previous studies have mostly employed an inverse temperature of @xmath19 ( corresponding to an experimentally relevant temperature of 50 - 100k , depending on hopping strength ) .",
    "we show that further lowering the temperature actually _ strengthens _ the polarons , even though the effect of entropy is reduced , i.e. , they are also energetically favored . only at small @xmath0 ,",
    "low temperatures enhance a tendency to phase separation and toward diagonal chains of holes .",
    "we also investigate the 3d model where we likewise find independent polarons at small doping , and in addition a polaron lattice at higher doping .",
