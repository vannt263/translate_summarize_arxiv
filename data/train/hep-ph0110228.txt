    "the most unsatisfactory feature of the standard model is our lack of knowledge of the actual mechanism that breaks the electroweak gauge symmetry and generates the particle masses . in the standard model",
    "the breaking occurs by a complex higgs boson doublet .",
    "three components of this doublet become the longitudinal polarisation states of the massive vector gauge bosons ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) , while the remaining component manifests itself as a neutral massive scalar higgs particle . on the other hand",
    "the minimal supersymetric model contains two higgs boson doublets .",
    "three fields are taken by the vector bosons and remaining five become physical particles : a pair of charged boson @xmath5 , two scalars @xmath6 , @xmath7 and one pseudoscalar @xmath8 .",
    "many more complicated mass generation models have been proposed , but their common feature is that the couplings of the higgs bosons to fermions increase with the fermion mass .",
    "thus for leptons the @xmath9 coupling dominates over the @xmath10 , @xmath11 couplings . the experimental observation which breaks @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , universality by favouring @xmath0 events",
    "could be an indication of the presence of a higgs scalar .",
    "whenever such a departure from lepton universality is observed a simple helicity correlation test can be performed which will clearly indicate that the @xmath0 pairs have scalar boson origin as opposed to arising from vector boson decay . we will show that correlation of polarisations of the outgoing @xmath14 leptons are very different for @xmath15 decays from that for @xmath2 decays .",
    "the distinction arises because the vector bosons @xmath16 decay into either @xmath17 or @xmath18 whereas the scalar higgs bosons @xmath19 into @xmath20 or @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes the @xmath14 pairs spin configurations .",
    "we present the algorithm for the interfacing the @xmath14 lepton decay package tauola - a library of monte carlo programs to simulate decays of @xmath14 leptons @xcite with `` any '' production generator to include spin effects in the elementary @xmath23 process @xcite .",
    "the approximate spin correlation are calculated from the information stored in the hepevt common block @xcite filled by `` any '' @xmath14 production program as described in ref.@xcite . as a demonstration example",
    "the interface is combined with the jetset generator , however it should work in the same manner with the pythia @xcite , herwig or isajet generators as well .",
    "in fact , such an interface can be considered as a separate software project , to some degree independent both from the specific problem of @xmath14 production and its decay .",
    "+ the aim of this interface is _ not _ to replace the matrix element calculations , but rather to provide a method of calculating / estimating spin effects in cases when spin effects would not be taken care of , at all .",
    "such an approach is limited for the treatment of longitudinal spin degrees only and to the case of particle production and decay in the ultra - relativistic limit .",
    "the approximation consists of reconstructing information of the elementary @xmath24 body process @xmath25 , burried inside multi - body production process such as for example @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 etc .",
