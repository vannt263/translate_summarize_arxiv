    "the interest in gaussian states is both theoretical as well as experimental since simple analytical tools are available and , on the experimental side , optical components effecting gaussian processes are readily available in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "quantum optical systems give rise to interesting nonclassical behavior such as photon antibunching and sub - poissonian photon statistics owing to the discreetness or photon nature of the radiation field @xcite .",

    "physical realizations and measurements of the second - order coherence function @xmath1 of light have been studied earlier via a degenerate parametric amplifier ( dpa ) @xcite .    the early work on parametric amplification @xcite has led to a wealth of research , for instance , in sub - poissonian statistics and squeezed light @xcite , squeezing in the output of a cavity field @xcite , quantum noise , measurement , and amplification @xcite , and photon antibunching @xcite .",
    "the need to formulate measurable conditions to discern the classical or nonclassical behavior of a dynamical system is important and so several criteria exist for nonclassicality .",
    "in particular , the use of the glauber - sudarshan p function to determine the existence or nonexistence of a quasiprobability distribution @xmath2 that would characterize whether the system has a classical counterpart or not @xcite .",
    "the existent differing criteria for nonclassicality actually complement each other since nonclassicality criteria derived from the one - time function @xmath2 is actually complemented by the nonclassicality criteria involving the two - time coherence function @xmath1 .",
    "note that nonclassicality information provide by @xmath1 can not be obtained solely from @xmath2 .    in a recent work @xcite ,",

    "the hamiltonian for degenerate parametric amplification , in the interaction picture , is @xmath4 the system is initially in a thermal state @xmath5 and a after a preparation time @xmath6 , the system temporally develops into a gaussian state and so @xcite @xmath7 @xmath8 with the displacement @xmath9 and the squeezing @xmath10 operators , where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the photon annihilation ( creation ) operator , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",

    "the quantum mechanical seconde - order , degree of coherence is given by @xcite @xmath25 where all the expectation values are traces with the gaussian density operator , viz .",

    ", the system evolves to the gaussian state @xmath24 and a photon is annihilated at time @xmath6 , the system then develops in time and after a time @xmath26 another photon is annihilated @xcite .",
    "therefore , two photon are annihilated in a time separation @xmath26 when the system is in the gaussian density state @xmath24 .",
    "it is important to remark that we do not suppose statistically stationary fields @xcite .",
    "therefore , owing to the @xmath26 dependence of the number of photons in the cavity in the denominator of equation ( 6 ) , the system asymptotically , as @xmath27 , approaches a finite limit without supposing any sort of dissipative processes @xcite .",
    "the coherence function @xmath1 is a function of @xmath28 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and the average number of photons @xmath29 in the initial thermal state ( 3 ) , where the preparation time @xmath6 is the time that it takes the system to dynamically generate the gaussian density @xmath24 given by ( 2 ) from the initial thermal state @xmath5 given by ( 3 ) .",
    "note that the limit @xmath30 is a combined limit whereby @xmath31 also approaches zero resulting in a correlation function which has a power law decay as @xmath32 rather than an exponential law decay as @xmath32 as is the case in the presence of squeezing when @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the correlation function ( 6 ) deals with the product of two - time operators .",
    "however , a complete statistical description of a field involves only the expectation value of any function of the operators @xmath11 and @xmath34 .",
    "a characteristic function contains all the necessary information to reconstruct the density matrix for the state of the field .",
    "now @xcite @xmath35 @xmath36 accordingly , for any operator function @xmath37 , one has that @xmath38 = \\textup{tr}[\\hat{\\rho}_{g } \\mathcal{\\hat{o}}\\big{(}\\hat{a}(\\tau),\\hat{a}^\\dag ( \\tau)\\big{)}]\\ ] ] @xmath39    one obtains for the characteristic function @xmath40\\exp{(|\\eta|^2/2)}\\ ] ] @xmath41\\ ] ] @xmath42 @xmath43 where    @xmath44 @xmath45\\big { [ } -\\frac{1}{2}\\sinh(\\omega\\tau)\\ ] ] @xmath46 } \\bigg{)}\\ ] ] and @xmath47    the expectation value @xmath48 $ ] can be calculated by differentiation of the characteristic function @xmath0 with respect to @xmath49 and @xmath50 as independent variables , viz .",

    "one has the normalization condition @xmath57 ; however , @xmath2 would not describe probabilities , even if positive , of mutually exclusive states since coherent states are not orthogonal .",
    "in fact , coherent states are over complete .",
    "the quasiprobability distribution @xmath2 is related to the characteristic function @xmath0 via the two - dimensional fourier transform @xmath58 the characteristic function @xmath0 is a well - behaved function whereas the integral ( 16 ) is not always well - behaved , for instance , if @xmath0 diverges as @xmath59 , then @xmath2 can only be expressed in terms of generalized functions .",
    "nonetheless , @xmath2 can be still used to calculate moments of products of @xmath11 and @xmath34 .",
    "it is important to remark that knowledge of @xmath2 without further knowledge of the dynamics governing the system , can only be used to calculate equal - time properties of the system and does not allow us to calculate , for instance , correlation functions , in particular , the quantum mechanical , second - order degrees of coherence @xmath1 . the determination of the latter requires , in addition , to @xmath2 the temporal behavior @xmath60 .",
    "the integral ( 16 ) can be carried out for the characteristic function ( 9 ) and so @xmath61 where @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66    the existence of a real - valued function @xmath2 requires that @xmath67 , which with the aid of ( 18 ) , gives that @xmath68 where the equality hold when @xmath69 and @xmath70 at @xmath71 .",
    "note that criterion ( 19 ) does not depend on the coherent amplitude @xmath20 , which appears via @xmath72 .",
    "also , if inequality ( 19 ) is initially satisfied at @xmath71 , then as time goes on the inequality will be violated since the squeezing continues indefinitely and so no matter the value of @xmath29 , eventually as @xmath26 increases the dynamics will always lead to nonclassical states .",
    "the existence of @xmath2 requires also that it must vanish as @xmath73 .",
    "the bilinear form @xmath74 in the exponential in ( 17 ) can be diagonalized in the variables @xmath75 and @xmath76 resulting in the eigenvalues @xmath77 and @xmath78 that must be nonnegative which requirement gives rise to the same condition ( 19 ) for the existence of a genuine probability distribution @xmath2 .",
    "two simple examples follow directly from ( 16 ) . for the displaced vacuum state for @xmath79 , one obtains , since @xmath80 , that @xmath81 , the coherent state .",
    "similarly , for @xmath82 one obtains for the displaced thermal state that @xmath83 , which becomes the previous example in the vacuum limit when @xmath84 .",
    "the necessary and sufficient condition for nonclassicality is then @xmath85 which is based only on knowledge of @xmath2 .",
    "note that ( 20 ) is independent of the value of the coherent parameter @xmath20 .",
    "as indicated above , mere knowledge of @xmath2 does not allow the calculation of the quantum mechanical correlation functions additional knowledge of the the dynamics of the system is necessary , for instance , @xmath60 for @xmath79 .",
    "nonclassical light can be characterized differently , for instance , with the aid of the quantum degree of second - order coherence @xmath1 by the nonclassical inequalities @xmath86 where the first inequality represents the sub - poissonian statistics , or photon - number squeezing , while the second gives rise to antibunched light .",
    "hence a measurement of @xmath1 can be used to determine the nonclassicality of the field .",
    "the two nonclassical effects often occur together but each can occur in the absence of the other .",
    "similarly , one can derive the nonclassical inequality @xcite @xmath87 that is , @xmath1 can be farther away from unity than it was initially at @xmath71 .",
    "accordingly , in the determination of the nonclassicality of the field , situations may arise where some of the observable nonclassical characteristics such as squeezing and sub - poissonian statistics are lost while @xmath88 still remains nonclassical , that is , inequality ( 20 ) holds true while some of the inequalities in ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) are violated .",
    "these situations do arise since the nonclassicality condition ( 20 ) is independent of the value of the coherent amplitude @xmath20 whereas the nonclassicality conditions ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) do depend on the value of @xmath20 .",
    "another sufficient condition for nonclassicality is determined by the mandel @xmath3 parameter related to the photon - number variance @xcite @xmath89 where @xmath90 implies that @xmath88 assumes negative values and thus the field must be nonclassical with sub - poissonian statistics .",
    "condition @xmath91 is equivalent to the first condition in equation ( 21 ) since @xmath92 $ ] .",
    "it important to remark that the latter equality holds only at @xmath71 when both @xmath93 and @xmath94 represent one - time functions .",
    "the correlation function @xmath1 is a two - time function for @xmath95 whereas @xmath3 is a one - time function for @xmath96 .",
    "note that if the mandel @xmath3 parameter is positive , then no conclusion can be drawn on the nonclassical nature of the radiation field .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath97 requires knowledge of the characteristic function @xmath0 or the quasiprobability distribution @xmath2 and by taking successive derivatives .",
    "such knowledge involves only one - time functions ; whereas the correlation function @xmath1 is a two - time function thus the nonclassicality determined by differing criteria complement each other .",
    "owing to the equivalence of the nonclassical conditions given by the first of equation ( 21 ) and the mandel condition @xmath98 , we need study only numerically the relation of the nonclassical inequalities ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) for the coherence function @xmath1 and compare them to the nonclassical condition ( 20 ) for the quasiprobability distribution @xmath2 .",
    "it is important to remark that the nonclassicality criteria ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) for @xmath1 depend strongly of the value of the coherent amplitude @xmath20 whereas the nonclassicality criterion ( 20 ) for @xmath88 is actually independent of the value of @xmath20 .",
    "the coherence function @xmath1 is rather sensitive to the value of @xmath20 .",
    "this will allow us to determine if the system can exhibit quantum behavior even though the known nonclassicality conditions given by both equations ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) for the coherence function @xmath1 are violated or , conversely , if the system exhibits nonclassical behavior even though the nonclassicality criterion ( 20 ) for @xmath88 is violated .",
    "it is interesting that equation ( 20 ) for the nonclassicality of @xmath2 is independent of the coherent parameter @xmath20 since the eigenvalues of the quadratic form @xmath74 in the exponential in ( 17 ) are independent of @xmath20 while the coherence function @xmath1 is rather sensitive to the value of @xmath20 .",
    "the validity of any one of the inequalities in equations ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) is sufficient but none of them is actually necessary for nonclassicality . on the other hand , the nonclassicality criterion ( 20 ) for",
    "the one - time function @xmath88 may not determine the nonclassicality of the two - time correlation function @xmath1 and conversely .",
    "therefore , condition ( 20 ) can not be a necessary and sufficient condition for nonclassicality since when violated , implying thereby the system is in a classical state , nonetheless the two - time correlation function exhibits nonclassical behavior .",
    "the numerical results for @xmath1 , as given by figures 5 and 6 , attest to this conclusion , where ( 20 ) gives classical behavior from condition ( 20 ) for @xmath2 for @xmath99 , since @xmath100 for @xmath101 , whereas , both figures 5 and 6 indicate nonclassical behavior for @xmath102 . to minimize intensity fluctuations , it is always optimal to squeeze the amplitude quadrature , that is , to choose @xmath103 , which we impose on all our numerical work .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the strictly classical features of the correlation function @xmath1 for @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 since @xmath1 violates the nonclassical inequalities given by equations ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) .",
    "note , however , that the nonclassical inequality ( 20 ) is satisfied for @xmath107 since @xmath108 .",
    "accordingly , a quasiprobability distribution @xmath2 does not exist since @xmath2 does not vanish as @xmath73 nonetheless the correlation @xmath1 exhibits classical behavior .",
    "thus the nonclassical nature of the radiation field , according to the @xmath2 criteria , does not imply that the correlation @xmath1 must behave nonclassically .    in order to show the strong dependence of the coherence function @xmath1 on the coherent parameter @xmath20 , we show in figure 3 the behavior of @xmath1 for the same values @xmath109 and @xmath105 as those in figures 1 but with the value of @xmath110 . in figure 3 ,",
    "both nonclassical inequalities in ( 21 ) are satisfied . in figure 4",
    ", we plot the variable associated with inequality ( 22 ) that shows classicality for @xmath111 and nonclassicality for @xmath112 .",
    "thus the nonclassical nature of the radiation field , according to the @xmath2 criteria ( 20 ) , can give rise also to mixed classical / nonclassical behavior in the correlation @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath113 gives the critical value of @xmath114 , for given @xmath29 and @xmath115 , for which the inequality sign of the second inequality in ( 21 ) changes direction . that is , a critical point from classicality to nonclassicality .",
    "for instance , for the cases in figures 1 and 3 , @xmath109 , @xmath105 , the critical value is @xmath116 .",
    "that is , @xmath117 for @xmath118 and @xmath119 for @xmath120 .",
    "figures 5 and 6 show the mixed classical / nonclassical nature of both @xmath1 and @xmath121 for @xmath122 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 . in view of inequalities ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) , both functions have nonclassical behavior for @xmath123 and classical for @xmath124 .",
    "the nonclassicality criterion ( 20 ) indicates that a quasiprobability distribution @xmath2 exhibits classical behavior for @xmath125 and nonclassical for @xmath126 .",
    "therefore , studies of the temporal second - order quantum mechanical correlation function @xmath1 , for instance , using a hanbury brown - twiss intensity interferometer modified for homodyne detection @xcite , will show the nonclassical nature of the correlation .",
    "this is contrary to what the nonclassicality criterion ( 20 ) would indicate .",
    "one must recall that the difference between criterion ( 20 ) and criteria ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) is that the former is based on one - time measurement or behavior of the system whereas the latter involves two - time measurements .",
