    "idempotent mathematics can be treated as a result of a dequantization of the traditional mathematics over numerical fields as the planck constant @xmath13 tends to zero taking imaginary values .",
    "this point of view was presented by g.  l.  litvinov and v.  p.  maslov @xcite , see also @xcite . in other words ,",
    "idempotent mathematics is an asymptotic version of the traditional mathematics over the fields of real and complex numbers .",
    "the basic paradigm is expressed in terms of an _",
    "idempotent correspondence principle_. this principle is closely related to the well - known correspondence principle of n.  bohr in quantum theory .",
    "actually , there exists a heuristic correspondence between important , interesting , and useful constructions and results of the traditional mathematics over fields and analogous constructions and results over idempotent semirings and semifields ( i.e. , semirings and semifields with idempotent addition ) .    a systematic and consistent application of the idempotent correspondence principle leads to a variety of results , often quite unexpected .",
    "as a result , in parallel with the traditional mathematics over fields , its `` shadow , '' the idempotent mathematics , appears .",
    "this `` shadow '' stands approximately in the same relation to the traditional mathematics as does classical physics to quantum theory , see fig .  1",

    "the term ` tropical semirings ' was introduced in computer science to denote discrete versions of the max - plus algebra @xmath1 or min - plus algebra @xmath2 and their subalgebras ; ( discrete ) semirings of this type were called tropical semirings by dominic perrin in honour of imre simon ( who is a brasilian mathematician and computer scientist ) because of his pioneering activity in this area , see @xcite .",
    "more recently the situation and terminology have changed . for the most part of modern authors",
    "` tropical ' means ` over @xmath44 ( or @xmath51 ) ' and tropical semirings are idempotent semifields @xmath44 and @xmath51 . the terms ` max - plus ' and ` min - plus ' are often used in the same sense .",
    "now the term ` tropical mathematics ' usually means ` mathematics over @xmath44 or @xmath51 ' , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "terms ` tropicalization ' and ` tropification ' ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) mean exactly dequantization and quantization in our sense . in any case , tropical mathematics is a natural and very important part of idempotent mathematics .    note that in papers @xcite n.  n.  vorobjev developed a version of idempotent linear algebra ( with important applications , e.g. , to mathematical economics ) and predicted many aspects of the future extended theory .",
    "he used the terms ` extremal algebras ' and ` extremal mathematics ' for idempotent semirings and idempotent mathematics .",
    "unfortunately , n.  n.  vorobjev s papers and ideas were forgotten for a long period , so his remarkable terminology is not in use any more .",
    "the first known paper on idempotent ( linear ) algebra is due to s.  kleene @xcite .",
    "systems of linear algebraic equations over an exotic idempotent semiring of all formal languages over a fixed finite alphabet are examined in this work ; however , s.  kleene s ideas are very general and universal . since then , dozens of authors investigated matrices with coefficients belonging to an idempotent semiring and the corresponding applications to discrete mathematics , computer science , computer languages , linguistic problems , finite automata , optimization problems on graphs , discrete event systems and petry nets , stochastic systems , computer performance evaluation , computational problems etc .",
    "this subject is very well known and well presented in the corresponding literature , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the idempotent linear algebra is treated in the papers of p.  butkovi @xcite and e.  wagneur @xcite in the present volume .",
    "idempotent abstract algebra is not so well developed yet ( on the other hand , from a formal point of view , the lattice theory and the theory of ordered groups and semigroups are parts of idempotent algebra ) .",
    "however , there are many interesting results and applications presented , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "in particular , an idempotent version of the main theorem of algebra holds @xcite for radicable idempotent semifields ( a semiring @xmath57 is _ radicable _ if the equation @xmath58 has a solution @xmath59 for any @xmath60 and any positive integer @xmath61 ) . it is proved that @xmath44 and other radicable semifields are algebraically closed in a natural sense @xcite .",
    "idempotent analysis was initially constructed by v.  p.  maslov and his collaborators and then developed by many authors .",

    "is closely related to the lattice theory , theory of vector lattices , and theory of ordered spaces . moreover , this partial order allows to model a number of basic `` topological '' concepts and results of idempotent analysis at the purely algebraic level ; this line of reasoning was examined systematically in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "calculus deals mainly with functions whose values are numbers . the idempotent analog of a numerical function is a map @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is an arbitrary set and @xmath14 is an idempotent semiring",
    ". functions with values in @xmath14 can be added , multiplied by each other , and multiplied by elements of @xmath14 pointwise .",
    "the idempotent analog of a linear functional space is a set of @xmath14-valued functions that is closed under addition of functions and multiplication of functions by elements of @xmath14 , or an @xmath14-semimodule .",
    "consider , e.g. , the @xmath14-semimodule @xmath70 of all functions @xmath68 that are bounded in the sense of the standard order on @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath71 , then the idempotent analog of integration is defined by the formula @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "indeed , a riemann sum of the form @xmath74 corresponds to the expression @xmath75 , which tends to the right - hand side of  ( 1 ) as @xmath76 .",
    "of course , this is a purely heuristic argument .",
    "formula  ( 1 ) defines the _ idempotent _ ( or _ maslov _ ) _ integral _ not only for functions taking values in @xmath1 , but also in the general case when any of bounded ( from above ) subsets of  @xmath14 has the least upper bound .",
    "an _ idempotent _ ( or _ maslov _ ) _ measure _ on @xmath69 is defined by @xmath77 , where @xmath78 .",
    "the integral with respect to this measure is defined by @xmath79    obviously , if @xmath80 , then the standard order @xmath62 is opposite to the conventional order @xmath81 , so in this case equation  ( 2 ) assumes the form @xmath82 where @xmath83 is understood in the sense of the conventional order @xmath81 .",
    "note that the so - called pseudo - analysis ( see a survey paper of e.  pap @xcite published in the present volume ) is related to a special part of idempotent analysis ; however , this pseudo - analysis is not a proper part of idempotent mathematics in the general case .",
    "maslov measures are nonnegative ( in the sense of the standard order ) just as probability measures .",
    "the analogy between idempotent and probability measures leads to important relations between optimization theory and probability theory . by the present time",
    "idempotent analogues of many objects of stochastic calculus have been constructed and investigated , such as max - plus martingales , max - plus stochastic differential equations , and others .",
    "these results allow , for example , to transfer powerful stochastic methods to the optimization theory .",
    "this was noticed and examined by many authors ( g.  salut , p.  del moral , m.  akian , j .-",

    "see @xcite and especially the book of a.  a.  puhalskii @xcite .",
    "many other idempotent analogs may be given , in particular , for basic constructions and theorems of functional analysis .",
    "idempotent functional analysis is an abstract version of idempotent analysis . for the sake of simplicity",
    "take @xmath84 and let @xmath69 be an arbitrary set .",
    "the idempotent integration can be defined by the formula ( 1 ) , see above .",
    "the functional @xmath85 is linear over @xmath14 and its values correspond to limiting values of the corresponding analogs of lebesgue ( or riemann ) sums .",
    "an idempotent scalar product of functions @xmath86 and @xmath87 is defined by the formula @xmath88 so it is natural to construct idempotent analogs of integral operators in the form @xmath89 where @xmath90 is an element of a space of functions defined on a set @xmath91 , and @xmath92 is an @xmath14-valued function on @xmath93 . of course",
    ", expressions of this type are standard in optimization problems .",
    "recall that the definitions and constructions described above can be extended to the case of idempotent semirings which are conditionally complete in the sense of the standard order .",
    "using the maslov integration , one can construct various function spaces as well as idempotent versions of the theory of generalized functions ( distributions ) .",
    "for some concrete idempotent function spaces it was proved that every ` good ' linear operator ( in the idempotent sense ) can be presented in the form ( 3 ) ; this is an idempotent version of the kernel theorem of l.  schwartz ; results of this type were proved by v.  n.  kolokoltsov , p.  s.  dudnikov and s.  n.  samborski , i.  singer , m.  a.  shubin and others , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "so every ` good ' linear functional can be presented in the form @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is an idempotent scalar product .    in the framework of idempotent functional analysis results of this type",
    "can be proved in a very general situation . in @xcite an algebraic version of the idempotent functional analysis",
    "is developed ; this means that basic ( topological ) notions and results are simulated in purely algebraic terms .",
    "the treatment covers the subject from basic concepts and results ( e.g. , idempotent analogs of the well - known theorems of hahn - banach , riesz , and riesz - fisher ) to idempotent analogs of a.  grothendieck s concepts and results on topological tensor products , nuclear spaces and operators .",
    "an abstract version of the kernel theorem is formulated .",
    "note that the passage from the usual theory to idempotent functional analysis may be very nontrivial ; for example , there are many non - isomorphic idempotent hilbert spaces",
    ". important results on idempotent functional analysis ( duality and separation theorems ) are recently published by g.  cohen , s.  gaubert , and j .-",
    "quadrat @xcite ; see also a finite dimensional version of the separation theorem in @xcite .",
    "three papers on this subject by m.  akian , s.  gaubert , v.  kolokoltsov , g.  cohen , j .-",
    "quadrat , i.  singer , and c.  walsh @xcite are published in this volume .",
    "there is an `` idempotent '' version of the theory of linear representations of groups and semigroups and the abstract harmonic analysis , see , e.g. , @xcite . in the framework of this theory",
    "the well - known legendre transform can be treated as an idempotent version of the traditional fourier transform ( this observation is due to v.  p.  maslov ) .",
    "basic equations of quantum theory are linear ; this is the superposition principle in quantum mechanics .",
    "the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation , the basic equation of classical mechanics , is nonlinear in the conventional sense .",
    "however , it is linear over the semirings @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , different versions of the bellman equation , the basic equation of optimization theory , are linear over suitable idempotent semirings ; this is v.  p.  maslov s idempotent superposition principle , see @xcite .",
    "for instance , the finite - dimensional stationary bellman equation can be written in the form @xmath96 , where @xmath69 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 are matrices with coefficients in an idempotent semiring @xmath14 and the unknown matrix @xmath69 is determined by @xmath97 and @xmath98 . in particular , standard problems of dynamic programming and the well - known shortest path problem correspond to the cases @xmath71 and @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "it is known that principal optimization algorithms for finite graphs correspond to standard methods for solving systems of linear equations of this type ( i.e. , over semirings ) .",
    "specifically , bellman s shortest path algorithm corresponds to a version of jacobi s algorithm , ford s algorithm corresponds to the gauss ",
    "seidel iterative scheme , etc .",
    "the linearity of the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation over @xmath2 and @xmath1 , which is the result of the maslov dequantization of the schrdinger equation , is closely related to the ( conventional ) linearity of the schrdinger equation and can be deduced from this linearity .",
    "thus , it is possible to borrow standard ideas and methods of linear analysis and apply them to a new area .",
    "the action functional @xmath100 can be considered as a function taking the set of curves ( trajectories ) to the set of real numbers which can be treated as elements of @xmath2 . in this case",
    "the minimum of the action functional can be viewed as the maslov integral of this function over the set of trajectories or an idempotent analog of the euclidean version of the feynman path integral .",
    "the minimum of the action functional corresponds to the maximum of @xmath101 , i.e. idempotent integral @xmath102 .",
    "thus the least action principle can be considered as an idempotent version of the well - known feynman approach to quantum mechanics .",
    "the representation of a solution to the schrdinger equation in terms of the feynman integral corresponds to the lax ",
    "olenik solution formula for the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation .",
    "the idempotent superposition principle indicates that there exist important nonlinear ( in the traditional sense ) problems that are linear over idempotent semirings .",
    "the linear idempotent functional analysis is a natural tool for investigation of those nonlinear infinite - dimensional problems that possess this property .",
    "an idempotent version of real algebraic geometry was discovered in the report of o.  viro for the barcelona congress @xcite .",
    "starting from the idempotent correspondence principle o.  viro constructed a piecewise - linear geometry of polyhedra of a special kind in finite dimensional euclidean spaces as a result of the maslov dequantization of real algebraic geometry .",
    "he indicated important applications in real algebraic geometry ( e.g. , in the framework of hilbert s 16th problem for constructing real algebraic varieties with prescribed properties and parameters ) and relations to complex algebraic geometry and amoebas in the sense of i.  m.  gelfand , m.  m.  kapranov , and a.  v.  zelevinsky ( see their book @xcite and @xcite )",
    ". then complex algebraic geometry was dequantized by g.  mikhalkin and the result turned out to be the same ; this new ` idempotent ' ( or asymptotic ) geometry is now often called the _ tropical algebraic geometry _ , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "there is a natural relation between the maslov dequantization and amoebas .",
    "suppose @xmath103 is a complex torus , where @xmath104 is the group of nonzero complex numbers under multiplication .",
    "for @xmath105 and a positive real number @xmath45 denote by @xmath106 the element @xmath107 suppose @xmath108 is a complex algebraic variety ; denote by @xmath109 the set @xmath110 .",

    "thus @xmath14 can be treated as a generalized ( extended ) logic with logical operations @xmath10 ( disjuction ) and @xmath15 ( conjunction ) .",
    "ideas of this kind are discussed in many books and papers with respect to generalized versions of logic and especially quantum logic , see , e.g. , @xcite . in the present volume",

    "if @xmath14 is a lattice ( i.e. @xmath144 and @xmath145 ) , then generalized fuzzy sets coincide with @xmath146-fuzzy sets in the sense of j.  a.  goguen @xcite .",

    "generalized theories can be noncommutative ; they seem to be more qualitative and less quantitative with respect to the classical theories presented in @xcite .",
    "we see that idempotent analysis and the theories of ( generalized ) fuzzy sets and possibility have the same objects , i.e. functions taking their values in semirings",
