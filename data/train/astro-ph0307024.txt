    "the photometric calibration of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) is based on a relatively new , five - filter , wide - band photometric system ( @xmath0 ) defined by @xcite .",
    "this system offers three astrophysical advantages over the established johnson - cousins @xmath1 system : ( 1 ) sharper cutoffs of the band edges , ( 2 ) minimal overlap of spectral regions between filters , and ( 3 ) filter breaks chosen to exclude the strongest night sky emission lines .",
    "we note the sdss @xmath2 filter is open on the red end .",
    "therefore , the system transformation coefficients are strongly dependent upon the choice of detector that observers use to match the standard star network .    to support the calibration of the sdss",
    ", @xcite developed the @xmath0 standard star system using the u.s .",
    "naval observatory flagstaff station 1-m telescope , which is essentially a northern hemisphere and equatorial network . as part of the noao surveys program ,",
    "we have extended our work to establish @xmath0 standard stars in the southern hemisphere .",
    "these new standards are tied to the existing northern and equatorial network @xcite developed for the sdss @xcite .",
    "the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) @xcite is a multi - wavelength program which uses the great space - based , and some of the largest ground - based , observatories to obtain deep imaging and spectroscopy of selected fields encompassing both the hubble deep field north and the chandra deep field south ( cdf  s ) .",
    "these fields are among the most studied areas in the sky .",
    "several programs are currently underway to probe the cdf  s to an unprecedented depth in several spectral regimes .",
    "these include ground - based studies in the optical ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the infrared ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observations of this field are also planned as part of the sirtf legacy and hst treasury programs , the latter using the new advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) .",
    "this last program , the hst ",
    "acs observations , is baselined to perform @xmath3 imaging @xcite ; hence , @xmath0 standard stars would be immediately useful to the goods observers and others .    until this report",
    ", no one has defined standard stars in the @xmath0 filter system in or near the cdf  s to use for photometric calibration . as part of our noao survey program ,",
    "we have observed the central region of the cdf ",
    "s to create local @xmath0 standards , presented herein , to facilitate other investigators use of these filters .",
    "further , the placement of standard stars within the cdf  s should ensure future observations , facilitating the study of long - term time variable phenomena and transient events in the region .    in this paper , we present details of our observations in  2",
    ", we describe the data reductions in  3 , and we present the @xmath0 magnitudes and colors of the cdf  s standard stars in  4 .",
    "we will examine remaining sources within the cdf ",
    "s in a future paper .",
    "for this study we targeted the center of the cdf",
    " s field at j2000 coordinates @xmath4 03:32:28 , @xmath527:48:30 @xcite [ @xmath6 . due to the nature of the sdss ,",
    "most of the existing standard stars used to calibrate these cdf  s local standards were on or near the equator .",
    "we selected the standard stars used as the basis for this work from the northern and equatorial @xmath0 network @xcite , since they are currently the only standard stars for this filter system .",
    "we may use additional standards being developed by our noao survey program for future refinement of cdf ",
    "s field object magnitudes .",
    "the data were collected with the ctio 0.9-m telescope using the tek2k#3 ccd operating at the cassegrain focus .",
    "this `` grade-1 '' ccd is thinned and has an anti - reflection coating , resulting in high quantum efficiency similar to that of the detector used to establish the initial standard system .",
    "observers have used this ccd in a stable configuration on this telescope since october 1995 .",
    "the imager is controlled by arcon software ( version 3.3 ) and operated in multiple amplifier read mode .",
    "the average gain and read noise values for each of the amplifiers are listed in table  [ gains ] .",
    "the ccd has 24@xmath7 pixels which gives a scale of 0.396  arcsec / pixel and results in a 13.5 arc - minute field of view .",
    "we observed with the ctio sdss @xmath0 filter set .    a current , machine - readable version of transmission curves for the ctio @xmath0 filter set is not available .",
    "for future use , however , we have requested a full spectral transmission scan for this filter set .",
    "likewise , a current machine - readable version of the ccd spectral response is not available . in the meantime , we have generated preliminary response functions for the ctio-0.9m+tek2k#3+@xmath0 filter system based upon ( 1 ) the @xmath0 filter transmission curves from the manufacturer ( custom scientific ) for an identical filter set , ( 2 ) the ctio tek2k quantum efficiency from the gif plot at the ctio ccd information website , and the aluminum reflectances from @xcite as reproduced by @xcite ( we assume two aluminum reflecting surfaces in the system ) .",
    "machine - readable tables of these preliminary filter responses are available at our public access urldtucker / southern_ugriz / index.html ] , where updated versions will be posted as new data become available .",
    "in figure  [ response ] we plot these ctio-0.9m+tek2k#3+@xmath0 filter system responses and , for comparison , those from the usno-1.0m+tek1k+@xmath0 filter system used to set up the original @xmath0 standard star network .",
    "the two system responses look quite similar .",
    "given the uncertainties in calculating the ctio @xmath0 response function , these curves are not inconsistent with the results we report later in this paper ( see   3 below ) .",
    "the values for the instrumental color terms we measure for our ctio-0.9 m data are typically quite small  ranging on average from about 0.02 to 0.06  mag per magnitude in color .",
    "( we must emphasize , though , that for the most accurate photometry  i.e. , systematic errors less than a few percent  instrumental color terms must be solved for and applied when converting ctio-0.9 m @xmath0 photometry to the usno standard system . )",
    "we have examined linearity of the ctio system using the dome flat lamps on different observing runs and found the response to be stable , linear , and repeatable from 0@xmath862,000 dn .",
    "these tests are usually performed once per observing run , weather `` permitting . ''",
    "figure  [ linearity ] shows the weighted average of the ccd response as a function of exposure time for three separate linearity sequences taken in may 2002 .",
    "figure  [ deviation ] gives the deviation from linearity by exposure time for the same data .",
    "other tests show identical responses .",
    "the full results will be published in the final paper at the end of the program .",
    "we have also examined linearity ( and shutter response ) by moving a cluster around the detector in a `` grid '' to look for measurement repeatability .",
    "preliminary results show no significant deviation of derived magnitudes from these tests .",
    "the supernovae monitoring group at ctio has made its shutter timing maps available to us , indicating expected deviations of @xmath9 ( 1.2 milli - mags ) from center to edge of the ccd for our minimum exposure of five seconds .",
    "based on the shutter data obtained by this group , the shutter exposure timing is stable and repeatable .",
    "we collect and median - combine calibration frames daily , usually during the afternoons .",
    "these consisted of a minimum of 10 bias and dome flat frames ( 10 per @xmath10 filter ) .",
    "the dome flats were obtained with a color balance filter . because of a lack of photons , we did not obtain @xmath11 dome flats .",
    "the dome flat images help us monitor the status of the ccd and look for changes in the flat - field structure .",
    "in addition , twilight sky flats were collected in all five filters during one or both of the twilight periods on each observable night .",
    "these were median - combined at the end of each observing run to produce a `` master '' twilight flat and used in the reduction of the data frames .",
    "we chose this approach to maintain consistency with the original standard network . at some point during each observing run , we usually collected long dark frames to monitor changes in the hot pixels on the ccd and to look for light leaks .",
    "we generated fringe correction frames using the long program object exposures .",
    "these were applied to the @xmath12 and @xmath2 band images .    during a typical night in our standards program ,",
    "we observe five or six existing standard fields three times each  at the start , near the middle , and at the end of the night  in order to establish an extinction and color term baseline . between these extended standard sequences , we usually alternate one or two program fields and one to three standard fields .",
    "we use these to monitor the extinction values established by the longer extinction scans .",
    "this observing method allows us to maximize the number of target fields while continuously monitoring the atmosphere for changes .",
    "exposure times for the established standard fields ranged from 5 to 240 seconds , with a mean of 7.9 seconds for the shortest exposures ( generally the @xmath13 filters ) .",
    "the program observations  performed under apparently clear conditions on nine different nights spanning three separate observing runs in 2001  september , 2002  february , and 2002  october  consisted of two separate exposure cycles , resulting in eighteen data points per filter .",
    "we obtained two additional @xmath14 band observations under obviously non - photometric conditions during the september 2001 observing run .",
    "these later observations were obtained to use in a differential search for short period variable stars but were not included in the calculations of the final magnitudes .",
    "after processing , we determined that our observations from 2002  october  5 were not photometric , so we discarded them from our final calculations of the calibrated magnitudes , leaving a total of sixteen photometric data points per filter .",
    "table  [ obs ] lists the circumstances of all our observations of the cdf  s field .",
    "the first two columns give the ut and modified julian date ( mjd jd @xmath15 2400000.5 , where jd is the julian date . ] ) of the observation ; the third column gives the approximate airmass at the start of the observation sequence .",
    "the exposure times ( in seconds ) for each filter appear in column four , and the last column gives the observer impression and reduction decisions concerning the sky conditions during the observations .",
    "we performed reductions using version v8.0 of the sdss software pipeline mtpipe ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , an earlier version of which was used in the setup of the original @xmath0 standard star network @xcite .",
    "this pipeline consists of four main packages :    * premtframes , which creates the directory structure for the reduction of a night s data , including parameter files needed as input for the other three packages , and runs quality - assurance tests on the raw data .",
    "* mtframes , which processes the images and performs object detection and aperture photometry on target field images .",
    "the processing steps include zero subtraction , flat - field and fringe - frame correction .",
    "* excal , which takes the aperture photometry lists for the standard star target fields ( i.e. , stars from @xcite ) , identifies the individual standard stars within those fields , and fits the observed raw counts and known @xmath0 magnitudes to a set of photometric equations to obtain extinction and zero point coefficients . the output from this package allows us to monitor the stability of the night .",
    "the default analysis block is three hours , but can be changed as required based upon the data present and upon trends in the reductions .",
    "a minimum of ten standard stars are required for the night to be useable .",
    "* kali , which applies the fitted photometric equations to the aperture photometry lists of program target fields for the appropriate analysis block ( e.g. , the cdf  s field ) .",
    "we note a few small differences between the methods employed in the current reductions and those used in setting up the original @xmath0 standard star network of @xcite .",
    "first , since we tailored our current effort towards calibrating standard stars which are typically much fainter than the @xcite standards ( which were generally in the range @xmath16  12 ) , we chose a smaller extraction size for our aperture photometry to reduce or minimize the background sky contribution to the noise .",
    "for the @xcite standards , we employed a 24-diameter aperture in order to avoid problems associated with defocusing the brightest stars ( required for some the observations ) . in the current program ,",
    "we have chosen a 14.86-diameter aperture .",
    "this smaller aperture reduces the effects of sky noise for the fainter cdf  s target stars ; as an added bonus , this size is the one used in the photometric calibration of the sdss 2.5 m data @xcite .",
    "tests on the fainter standards in @xcite show no significant deviations from the published magnitudes using this smaller extraction aperture .",
    "second , the current version of mtpipe uses photometric equations which are slightly modified from the form described in  4.2 of @xcite .",
    "the photometric equations employed in the current paper are the following :    @xmath17 \\nonumber \\\\                &    & + c_{u } [ ( u'-g')_{\\rm o } - ( u'-g')_{\\rm o , zp } ] [ x - x_{\\rm zp}]\\ ; , \\\\ g'_{\\rm inst } & = & g'_{\\rm o } + a_{g } + k_{g } x \\nonumber \\\\                &    & + b_{g } [ ( g'-r')_{\\rm o } - ( g'-r')_{\\rm o , zp } ] \\nonumber \\\\                &    & + c_{g } [ ( g'-r')_{\\rm o } - ( g'-r')_{\\rm o , zp } ] [ x - x_{\\rm zp}]\\ ; , \\\\ r'_{\\rm inst } & = & r'_{\\rm o } + a_{r } + k_{r } x \\nonumber \\\\                &    & + b_{r } [ ( r'-i')_{\\rm o } - ( r'-i')_{\\rm o , zp } ] \\nonumber \\\\                &    & + c_{r } [ ( r'-i')_{\\rm o } - ( r'-i')_{\\rm o , zp } ] [ x - x_{\\rm zp}]\\ ; , \\\\ i'_{\\rm inst } & = & i'_{\\rm o } + a_{i } + k_{i } x \\nonumber \\\\                &    & + b_{i } [ ( i'-z')_{\\rm o } - ( i'-z')_{\\rm o , zp } ] \\nonumber \\\\                &    & + c_{i } [ ( i'-z')_{\\rm o } - ( i'-z')_{\\rm o , zp } ] [ x - x_{\\rm zp}]\\ ; , \\\\",
    "z'_{\\rm inst } & = & z'_{\\rm o } + a_{z } + k_{z } x \\nonumber \\\\                &    & + b_{z } [ ( i'-z')_{\\rm o } - ( i'-z')_{\\rm o , zp } ] \\nonumber \\\\                &    & + c_{z } [ ( i'-z')_{\\rm o } - ( i'-z')_{\\rm o , zp } ] [ x - x_{\\rm zp } ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    taking the @xmath18 equation as an example , we note that @xmath19 is the measured instrumental magnitude , @xmath20 is the extra - atmospheric magnitude , @xmath21 is the extra - atmospheric color , @xmath22 is the nightly zero point , @xmath23 is the first order extinction coefficient , @xmath24 is the system transform coefficient , @xmath25 is the second order ( color ) extinction coefficient , and @xmath26 is the airmass of the observation .",
    "the zeropoint constants , @xmath27 and @xmath28 were defined , respectively , to be the average standard star observation airmass @xmath29 = 1.3 and the `` cosmic color , '' as listed in table  3 of @xcite .",
    "note that the above equations differ from their analogs in @xcite by the inclusion of zeropoint colors in the system transform ( `` b '' ) terms .",
    "( note also that there are some differences in the calibration methodology used in the current paper as opposed to that now used in standard photometric calibrations of the sdss imaging data .",
    "in particular , standard sdss calibrations now use different values for the zeropoint colors ; further , standard sdss calibrations now index the @xmath12 filter to @xmath30 and not to @xmath31 ; for more details see @xcite . )",
    "third , in @xcite , since we used one telescope ( the usno 1-m ) for all the observations in setting up the original @xmath0 standard star network , we set all values of the system transform ( `` b '' ) coefficients identically to zero . here , we are using a different telescope , so we solve for these `` b '' terms .",
    "fourth , instead of using the first - order inverse photometric equations to convert from instrumental magnitudes to calibrated magnitudes in kali ( eqs .",
    "9  13 of @xcite ) , the current version of mtpipe does this conversion by solving the above equations iteratively .    finally , since none of the @xmath32 and @xmath33 colors of the final set of cdf ",
    "s standards are very red , no red leak corrections were applied to the cdf  s @xmath11 magnitudes .    with these caveats in mind ,",
    "the night characterization data from mtpipe for each of the photometric nights included in this project are given in table  [ coeffs ] .",
    "these data include the mjd of observation ( column 1 ) , filter ( column 2 ) , zero points ( column 3 ) , system transformation terms ( column 4 ) , and first - order extinction terms ( columns 5 through 7 ) .",
    "note that the zero points and system tranformation terms are solved on a night - by - night basis ; since it is not uncommon for the first - order extinctions to vary during a night , we typically solve for them in 3-hour - long blocks of time .",
    "finally , columns 8 and 9 give the rms errors for , and numbers of , the standard stars observed that night which were used in the photometric solutions .",
    "the weighted mean averages are listed by filter at the bottom of the table as an aid to observers looking for mean site values . in a footnote",
    ", we also list the second order extinction terms derived in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ zplot ] shows the photometric zeropoint versus mjd for each filter .",
    "we see the slight degradation of telescope throughput with time , a result of the mirror not being re - aluminized over the course of this program to date .",
    "figure 5 of @xcite shows similar trends for the usno-1.0 m telescope , but the effect of re - aluminization is clearly seen .",
    "figure  [ kplot ] shows the first order extinction coefficients for each reduction block by mjd .",
    "as shown , all the nights used for these data were well behaved .",
    "finally , figure  [ std - rms ] shows the residuals of the excal solution for each filter by mjd for each of the standard stars used in the photometric solution .",
    "the plot is in the sense ( observed @xmath15 true ) , where `` true '' comes from @xcite . this plot may be slightly misleading since we did night - by - night solutions rather than a global solution .    at this point in the reduction process using mtpipe , we had sixteen calibrated object lists for the cdf ",
    "s , one list for each of the sixteen photometric exposures of this field .",
    "we combined these lists by taking the ( unweighted ) mean magnitude of each object in each filter . to avoid problems associated with signal - to - noise mismatches between the long and the short exposures",
    ", we only included in the mean magnitudes those measurements having photon noise errors of @xmath34  mag .",
    "we excluded saturated measurements from the mean magnitude calculations .",
    "the resulting list of candidate cdf ",
    "s standards contains 355 objects .",
    "we culled this list using the following criteria :    * the mean magnitude in @xmath14 must have been derived from at least ten good individual measurements .",
    "* the standard deviation of the individual measurements in @xmath14 must be less than 0.10  mag ( to avoid variables ) .",
    "* the error in the mean magnitude in @xmath14 ( standard deviation of the mean ) must be less than 0.03  mag ( to be useful as a standard star ) .",
    "* the mean magnitude in @xmath14 must be less than 18.0 , which is approximately the limit of our present data to achieve an error in the mean @xmath14 magnitude of less than 0.03  mag .",
    "after culling the mtpipe output using the above criteria , only 24 objects remained as candidate standard stars .",
    "then , we ran sextractor @xcite on one of our long cdf  s exposures to obtain the automated star - galaxy classifier value . any object",
    "classified as non - stellar either by sextractor , or by eye , was removed from the list of candidate standards .",
    "this resulted in removal of two galaxies .",
    "further , we used the eso imaging survey ( eis ) stellar catalog @xcite to confirm our star - galaxy separation for the brighter objects in our frames , and we deferred to the much deeper eis catalog classification for our fainter sources",
    ". finally , we performed a coordinate match with the combo-17 survey @xcite @xmath35 sources to obtain cross reference designations .",
    "the final list presented here contains 22 cdf ",
    "s standard stars .",
    "here , we present the calibrated magnitude and color data for each star in our final list of cdf  s local standards .",
    "table  [ stdstars ] shows the cdf  s standard stars arranged in order of increasing @xmath14-band magnitude and contains the combo-17 designation and the right ascension and declination ( j2000 ) in the first three columns .",
    "the next five columns give the @xmath14 band magnitudes and four color indices .",
    "these five columns are linked with the following five columns ( 9 - 13 ) which give the estimated rms error  i.e. , the standard deviation of the mean  of the measurements . as a note , during the reductions we calculated the five filter magnitudes .",
    "we report colors here as an observational aid .",
    "the associated uncertainties for the colors are derived from the magnitude errors added in quadrature . as such",
    ", they may be slightly overestimated , since magnitude errors in different filters tend to be correlated .",
    "the last five columns of this table list the number of individual measurements , by filter , that were used to determine the final magnitudes .",
    "finally , table  [ crossref ] gives the combo-17 and eso imaging survey ( eis ) @xcite designations with the coordinates ( j2000 ) for each of the stars in the final standard list . as with table",
    "[ stdstars ] , this list is arranged in order of increasing @xmath14-band magnitude .",
    "a finder chart , based upon on one of our long @xmath14 band images and showing the location of each of these standard stars , appears in figure  [ cdfs - finder ] .",
    "we present a histogram of the distribution of @xmath36 colors of the cdf  s local standards in figure  [ histogram ] .",
    "figure  [ mag - sig ] shows the estimated rms errors ( the standard deviation of the mean ) in the calibrated magnitudes versus the calibrated magnitude for the cdf  s local standards in each of the five filters .",
    "figure  [ color - sig ] shows the rms errors for the calibrated magnitudes versus the color for the cdf  s local standards in each of the filters .",
    "we began this effort in september 2000 using the 0.9-m at ctio and the same observers and reduction software that were used in the setup of the original @xmath0 standard network described in @xcite .",
    "we undertook this effort to provide a uniform set of standard stars in the @xmath0 system across the sky with the goal to provide future investigators a convenient starting grid to establish tertiary standards for their own work , without the need for an extensive end - to - end standardization effort .",
    "observations of this field will continue through the course of our survey program .",
    "as they become available , updated magnitudes and colors , along with all of the southern standard stars , will be posted our a public access url mentioned previously .",
    "we estimate that the entire grid of standard star from this project will become available for public dissemination by mid-2005 .",
