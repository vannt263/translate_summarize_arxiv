    "the last steps of this exciting development were the results of the sno @xcite and kamland experiments @xcite : the sno experiment provided a model - independent proof of solar @xmath1 transitions and the terrestrial disappearance of @xmath2 reactor neutrinos in the kamland experiment has shown that the puzzle of the solar neutrino deficit is solved by neutrino oscillations @xcite .",

    "these lecture notes are motivated by this development and aim at supplying the theoretical background for understanding and assessing it . in view of the importance of neutrino oscillations in this context",
    ", we will give a thorough discussion of vacuum neutrino oscillations and matter effects @xcite ( see section [ neuosc ] ) ; the description of the latter is tailored for an understanding of the flavour transformation of solar neutrinos and effects in earth matter .",
    "then , in section [ dvsm ] , we will switch to the subject of the neutrino nature , which is a question of principal interest but has no impact on neutrino oscillations ; we will work out the difference between dirac and majorana neutrinos and the basics of majorana neutrino effects .",

    "this selection will necessarily be biased due to personal interest and prejudices .",

    "the first observation is that  as the nc interactions are flavour - blind  neutrino - flavour production and detection proceeds solely via cc interactions with the hamiltonian density @xmath3 the next observation is that flavour transitions are induced by neutrino mixing : @xmath4 this relation means that the left - handed flavour fields are not identical with the left - handed components of the neutrino mass eigenfields @xmath5 corresponding to the mass @xmath6 , but are related via a matrix @xmath7 , which is determined by the neutrino mass term which will be discussed in section 3 . here",
    "we simply assume the existence of the mixing matrix @xmath7 and the neutrino masses @xmath6 .",

    "a _ sterile neutrino _ is defined as a neutral massive fermion which mixes with the active neutrinos , but has negligible couplings to the w and z bosons .",

    "neutrinos are never directly observed ; thus , for the description of neutrino oscillations it is required to consider the complete neutrino production ",
    "detection chain and to use only those quantities or particles which are really observed or manipulated in an experiment @xcite .",

    "we start with a consideration of the detector particle which is central to the first issue above @xcite . in all experiments",

    "( [ p ] ) .",
    "however , since all attempts up to now to find limitations of ( [ p ] ) accessible to experiment were in vain , the standard formula for the probability of neutrino oscillations in vacuum seems to be very robust .",
    "matter effects @xcite play a very important role in neutrino oscillations . here",
    "we confine ourselves to the case of ordinary matter , which is non - relativistic , electrically neutral and without preferred spin orientation .",

    "however , soft breaking of lepton numbers occurs at the _ high _ scale @xmath552 .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that this assumption yields a perfectly viable theory with interesting properties : all 1-loop flavour - changing vertices are finite because of soft @xmath574 breaking ; for @xmath575 , such vertices where the boson leg is a neutral scalar and the exchanged boson is a charged scalar do not decouple in the limit @xmath576 ( for @xmath577 there is decoupling ) ; diagrams with a @xmath226 or a @xmath578 and box diagrams always decouple . as a consequence ,",
    "the amplitudes of @xmath516 , @xmath579 are suppressed by @xmath580 , whereas , e.g. , the amplitude of @xmath581 tends to a constant for @xmath576 and is suppressed  though much less than the previous amplitudes  because it contains a product of four yukawa couplings .",

    "thus we obtain the result @xmath584 where @xmath585 is the solar mixing angle . summarizing",

    "the above results are stable under radiative corrections because the mass matrix ( [ z2massmatrix ] ) was realized by the symmetries @xmath587 , which are softly broken , and @xmath582 , which has to be broken spontaneously in order to achieve @xmath588 .",

    ", there are still many things we would like to know . for instance , are neutrinos dirac or majorana particles ?",
    "what are the absolute neutrino masses ?",
    "of what type is the neutrino mass spectrum ?",
    "do neutrinos have sizeable magnetic moments ?    as for field - theoretical models of neutrino masses and mixing , theorists are groping in the dark . as it has turned out ,",
    "neutrino mass spectra and the neutrino mixing matrix are very different from the quark sector .",
    "though there are many ideas , very few of them account naturally for some of the neutrino properties . despite the big increase in our knowledge about neutrinos even basic questions for model building have no answer at the moment .",
    "some of the basic questions are the following : is the neutrino mass and mixing problem independent of the general fermion mass problem ?",
    "are neutrino masses small by radiative , seesaw or other mechanisms ?",
    "is the solution for the neutrino mass and mixing problem situated at the tev scale or the gut scale ?",
    "do we need a flavour symmetry for its solution and , if yes , of what type is this symmetry ?",
    "we want to stress that it is no problem to _ accommodate _ neutrino masses and mixing in theories , but the problem is to _ explain _ the specific features for neutrinos . as for the neutrino nature",
    ", there is a theoretical bias toward majorana nature , e.g. from the seesaw mechanism and guts , in particular , from guts based on @xmath592 . for the time being , there are simply not enough clues for a definite mechanism for neutrino masses and mixing",
    ". among others , possible future clues provided by experiment would be an atmospheric mixing angle very close to @xmath593 , which would point toward a non - abelian flavour symmetry ; knowledge of the value of @xmath594 and the neutrino mass spectrum , which would teach us more about the mass matrix ; discovery of scalars with masses @xmath595 1 tev , which would show that fermion masses are most probably generated by the higgs mechanism ; discovery of susy partners of ordinary particles , which would assure us that we have to take susy into account in model building .",
    "evidence for flavour - changing decays like @xmath516 , @xmath596 , etc .",
    "would also give a valuable input .    at any rate",
    ", ongoing and future experiments will continue to provide us with exciting results , which will enhance the prospects of constructing viable mechanisms for explaining the specific neutrino features .",
