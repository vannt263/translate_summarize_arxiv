    "convection in a thin horizontal layer of an isotropic fluid heated from below by a heat current @xmath19 is well known as rayleigh - bnard convection ( rbc ) @xcite .",
    "when the fluid is a nematic liquid crystal ( nlc ) , this phenomenon is altered in interesting ways.@xcite nlc molecules are long , rod - like objects which are orientationally ordered relative to their neighbors , but whose centers of mass have no positional order @xcite .",
    "the axis parallel to the average orientation is called the director @xmath20 . by confining the nlc between two properly treated parallel plates @xcite , one can obtain a sample with uniform planar ( parallel to the surfaces , i.e. in the x - y plane ) or homeotropic ( perpendicular to the surfaces , or parallel to the z - axis ) alignment of @xmath20 . the alignment can be re - inforced by the application of a magnetic field @xmath21 parallel to the intended direction of @xmath20 .",
    "this is so because the diamagnetic susceptibility is anisotropic , usually being larger in the direction parallel to the long axis of the molecules .",
    "the phenomena which occur near the onset of convection depend on the orientation of @xmath20 and @xmath22 .",
    "@xcite in this paper we are concerned with a horizontal layer of a _ homeotropically _ aligned nlc in a vertical magnetic field ( @xmath23 ) and heated from below . in that case , @xmath24 is parallel to @xmath20 when the system is in the conduction state . at a critical temperature difference @xmath25",
    "the fluid will undergo a transition from conduction to convection .",
    "the precise value of @xmath26 , the nature of the bifurcation at @xmath26 , and the pattern - formation phenomena beyond @xmath26 are expected to depend in interesting ways upon @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "a feature common to the homeotropic nlc and to an isotropic fluid heated from below is that the system is isotropic in the horizontal plane .",
    "thus the convection pattern may form with no preference being given to a particular horizontal axis unless the experimental apparatus introduces an asymmetry . in both cases , the convection is driven by the buoyancy force .",
    "however , the mechanism in the nlc case is more involved.@xcite the usual destabilization due to the thermally - induced density gradient is opposed by the stiffness of the director field which is coupled to and distorted by any flow . since relaxation times of the director field are much longer than thermal relaxation times , it is possible for director fluctuations and temperature / velocity fluctuations to be out of phase as they grow in amplitude .",
    "the existence of two very different time scales and this phase shift typically lead to an oscillatory instability ( also known as overstability ) , _ i.e. _ the bifurcation at which these time - periodic perturbations acquire a positive growth rate is a hopf bifurcation.@xcite this case is closely analogous to convection in binary - fluid mixtures with a negative separation ratio.@xcite in that case , concentration gradients oppose convection , and concentration diffusion has the slow and heat diffusion the fast time scale . as in the binary mixtures ,",
    "the hopf bifurcation in the nlc case is subcritical @xcite . for the nlc the fully developed nonlinear",
    "state no longer is time periodic . instead , the statistically stationary state above the bifurcation is one of spatio - temporal chaos with a typical time scale which is about two orders of magnitude slower than the theoretical inverse hopf frequency.@xcite however , it is possible to actually measure the hopf frequency by looking at the growth or decay of small perturbations which are either deliberately introduced @xcite or which occur spontaneously when the system is close to the conduction state and near the bifurcation point .",
    "a linear stability analysis of this system was carried out by several investigators @xcite .",
    "a very detailed analysis was presented by feng , decker , pesch , and kramer ( fdpk ) @xcite .",
    "these authors also provided a weakly - nonlinear analysis , which allowed the distinction between sub- and supercritical bifurcations .",
    "quantitative bifurcation diagrams were predicted for the nematic liquid crystal mbba . in the present work we repeated and",
    "slightly extended the calculations for the material 5cb ( see below ) used in our experiments .",
    "since the material parameters of mbba and 5cb are similar , we found qualitatively the same bifurcation sequences as a function of the field .",
    "here we outline briefly the theoretical results and their relationship to our experimental results .    as the magnetic field",
    "is increased , a subcritical hopf bifurcation - line is expected to terminate at @xmath27 in a codimension - two point ( ctp ) beyond which the perturbations which first acquire a positive growth rate are at zero frequency . close to but beyond the ctp this stationary bifurcation",
    "is predicted to also be subcritical . at an even higher field",
    "@xmath28 a tricritical point ( tcp ) is predicted to exist beyond which the primary bifurcation is expected to become supercritical . to our knowledge",
    "there are no predictions about the patterns which should form beyond either the subcritical hopf bifurcation below the ctp or the subcritical stationary bifurcation between the ctp and the tcp . although there are no explicit predictions of the patterns for @xmath29 , in analogy to isotropic fluids one might expect convection rolls above the supercritical bifurcation , unless non - boussinesq effects@xcite yield a transcritical bifurcation to hexagons .",
    "the phenomena described above were previously explored only partially by experiment . except for recent measurements at relatively small fields @xcite ,",
    "the experiments have been qualitative or semi - quantitative @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we report the results of an extensive sytematic experimental investigation of this system which covered a wide range of magnetic fields @xmath1 . in agreement with previous work @xcite",
    ", we find a subcritical hopf bifurcation at relatively small @xmath1 which terminates in a codimension - two point ( ctp ) .",
    "the ctp is located at a slightly higher field than the theoretical prediction .",
    "we measured the hopf frequency @xmath30 from visualizations of the spontaneous small - amplitude early transients just above @xmath31 .",
    "except for the influence of the small shift of the ctp , we found @xmath30 to be in quantitative agreement with the theory .",
    "from these transients , we also determined the critical wavevector @xmath32 , and found it to be typically a few percent smaller than the theoretical value .",
    "the reason for this small difference between theory and experiment is not known .",
    "as reported previously @xcite , we found the convecting nonlinear state for @xmath0 above @xmath33 to be one of spatio - temporal chaos ( stc ) .",
    "except at very small @xmath1 , its characteristic wavenumber was smaller than @xmath11 and insensitive to @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "a long - time average of the structure factor of this state was consistent with the expected rotational invariance of the system . depending on @xmath1 , the lower limit @xmath34 at which this chaotic state made its hysteretic transition back to the conduction state",
    "was found to be 10 to 25% below @xmath35 .",
    "the convective heat transport was consistent with that of an isotropic fluid with an average conductivity given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the conductivities perpendicular and parallel to @xmath20 respectively .",
    "this suggests a thorough randomization of the director orientations by the flow .    beyond the ctp we found a subcritical stationary bifurcation , as had been predicted @xcite .",
    "the finite - amplitude state which evolved was also a state of stc , but beyond a certain field value greater than @xmath27 it had distinctly different properties from the chaotic state at lower @xmath1 .",
    "this difference was clearly evident from a discontinuity ( as a function of @xmath1 ) of the characteristic wavenumber of the nonlinear state , which was larger at the larger fields .",
    "there is no theoretical guidance for the interpretation of these experimentally observed phenomena .",
    "the range @xmath39 was investigated for two cells with aspect ratios @xmath40 and 5.01 .",
    "we refer to them as cells 5 and 6 respectively ( for details see sect .",
    "[ sec : expt ] below ) .",
    "we found a primary bifurcation to a state with a _",
    "hexagonal _ flow pattern . within our resolution",
    "this bifurcation was non - hysteretic and the nusselt number @xmath41 grew continuously from zero .",
    "the appearance of hexagons rather than rolls is attributable to non - boussinesq effects @xcite which occur when the up - down symmetry is lifted by variations of the fluid properties over the cell height .",
    "theoretically the bifurcation to hexagons is transcritical , and there should also be hysteresis associated with it .",
    "however , the hysteresis is often so small that it is unobservable even though hexagons are found over a substantial range.@xcite at sufficiently large @xmath42 the hexagons become unstable with respect to rolls.@xcite since @xmath31 decreases with the cell thickness @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) , the range of stability of hexagons should depend on the thickness of the fluid sample .",
    "however , for the _ thinner _ fluid layer of cell 5 , the existence range of hexagons was limited by a different secondary instability and grew from zero very near the tcp to @xmath45 at the highest fields available to us . at this stability limit",
    "a hysteretic transition yielded the chaotic state , and stationary rolls were never found .",
    "with decreasing @xmath0 , the chaotic state persisted down to @xmath34 somewhat smaller than @xmath31 . for the thicker fluid layer of cell 6 ,",
    "typically @xmath31 was about 2 @xmath46c , and hexagons were found only up to @xmath47 even at high fields . for @xmath48 , a pattern of rolls _",
    "not _ exhibiting stc was observed , as expected for a weakly non - boussinesq system . at",
    "even higher @xmath49 and consistent with the measurements in cell 5 , a hysteretic secondary bifurcation again yielded the chaotic state .",
    "the quantitative aspects of the instabilities are determined by four dimensionless parameters which are formed from combinations of the fluid properties @xcite .",
    "they are @xcite the prandtl number    @xmath50    the ratio between the director - relaxation time and the heat - diffusion time    @xmath51    the rayleigh number    @xmath52    and the dimensionless magnetic field    @xmath53    with the fredericksz field    @xmath54    in these equations @xmath55 is one of the viscosity coefficients , @xmath56 is the thermal diffusivity parallel to @xmath20 , @xmath57 is one of the elastic constants of the director field , @xmath58 is the anisotropy of the diamagnetic susceptibility , @xmath59 is the isobaric thermal expension coefficient , and @xmath60 is the gravitational acceleration . the time scale of transients and pattern dynamics is measured in terms of the thermal diffusion time    @xmath61    both @xmath7 and @xmath62 are easily varied in an experiment , and may be regarded as two independent control parameters .",
    "the availability of @xmath7 in addition to @xmath62 makes it possible to explore an entire line of instabilities .",
    "the parameters @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 are essentially fixed once a particular nlc and temperature range have been chosen , and even between different nlcs there is not a great range at our disposal .",
    "for 5cb at 25.6@xmath66 ( the material and mean temperature used in this work ) , we have @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the value of @xmath65 is typically several minutes , but depends on the thickness of the fluid layer .",
    "it is given in the next section for each of our cells .",
    "the critical value @xmath69 of @xmath62 and the fluid parameters determine the critical temperature difference @xmath31 for a sample of a given thickness @xmath43 .",
    "the realistic experimental requirement that @xmath70 a few @xmath66c dictates that the sample thickness should be a few @xmath71 .",

    "we followed closely the calculational methods of fdpk . in order to insure a sufficient resolution of any boundary layers we used chebycheff modes in the galerkin method ( no more than 20 were required )",
    "the apparatus used in this work was described previously @xcite .",
    "we made measurements using three circular cells of different thicknesses , identified as cells 4 , 5 , and 6 .",
    "@xcite the thickness and radius were @xmath78 , @xmath79 for cell 4 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 for cell 5 , and @xmath82 , @xmath83 for cell 6 .",

    "defect - free homeotropic samples were prepared by applying a magnetic field while cooling the bath , and thus the sapphire top plate of the sample , from above the isotropic - nematic transition temperature @xmath87 to @xmath88 . during this process ,",
    "the bottom plate naturally lagged behind , and thus an adverse density gradient existed . in the nematic / isotropic two - phase region",
    "even the relatively small thermal gradients associated with small cooling rates induced convection @xcite .",
    "when the cooling was too rapid and the field too small this led to a nematic sample with defects which remained frozen . by using cooling rates of @xmath89c / hour in the presence of a field of @xmath90 over the temperature interval 36 to 34@xmath66c ( @xmath91c ) and annealing at 34@xmath66c for an hour or two the defects healed and a defect - free homeotropic sample could be prepared .",
    "further cooling could then be at least ten times as rapid without introducing new defects because the threshold for convection in the nematic phase is large . before each experimental run",
    ", the procedure was repeated .",
    "the critical temperature differences for the onset of convection were determined from heat - transport measurements . these are usually expressed in terms of the nusselt number    @xmath92    where @xmath38 is the conductivity of the homeotropically aligned sample @xcite , and    @xmath93    is the effective conductivity and contains contributions from diffusive heat conduction and from hydrodynamic - flow advection .",
