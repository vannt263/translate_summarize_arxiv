    "entanglement is a property of quantum state which has been studied intensively in recent years as a specific nonlocal quantum mechanical correlation@xcite and it becomes recently a key feature of quantum information theory@xcite .",
    "when the entanglement is generated , observation or manipulation of it in practice constitutes a major obstacle , because of the fragility of quantum entanglement to the decoherence induced by environment .",
    "therefore , how to generate , maintain and control the entanglement in the presence of dissipative coupling of the system to the environment is of utmost importance in the implementation of quantum information processing .",
    "however , similar to the superposition of two coherent electromagnetic waves which enable us to learn some global information from a localized spatial area , people expect that the entanglement , which roots in the same superposition principle , can enable us to learn some global properties from a small part of the system",
    ". this observation may be one of the main motivations in the recent studies @xcite on the role of entanglement between a small part , e.g. a block consisting of one or more sites , and the rest of the system in the quantum phase transition .",
    "these results suggested that the local entanglement may be used as a good marker of quantum phase transition .",
    "then over the past few years there has been an ongoing effort to characterize the entanglement properties of condensed matter systems and apply them in quantum information .",
    "the quantum entanglement in solid state systems such as spin chains is an important emerging field@xcite .",
    "spin chain are natural candidates for realization of entanglement , and spin effects have been investigated in many other systems , such as superconductors@xcite , quantum dots@xcite and trapped ions@xcite .",
    "a most known models in the spin chains is heisenberg model and ising model as a special case of heisenberg model .",
    "the heisenberg model can describe interaction of qubits not only in solid physical systems but also in many other systems such as quantum dots@xcite , nuclear spin@xcite , cavity qed@xcite , optical lattice@xcite , quantum computation@xcite and controlled - not gate@xcite .    in recent years the two - qubit thermal entanglement which includes spin - spin interactions@xcite , and spin - orbit coupling@xcite ( dzyaloshinskii@xcite - moriya@xcite interaction ) has been studied .",
    "entanglement in two - qubit state has been well studied in the literature along various kind of three - qubit entanglement states@xcite .",
    "the three - qubit entanglement states have been shown to possess advantage over the two - qubit states in quantum teleportation@xcite , dense coding@xcite and quantum cloning@xcite .",
    "more specificly , both quantitative and qualitative behavior of the entanglement in two - qubit and three - qubit systems are different .",
    "the concurrence is always increasing in a two - qubit model versus dm parameter while it is both increasing and decreasing versus dm for a three - qubit model.the position where the concurrence is maximum or zero for a three - qubit model corresponds to the quantum critical point of the infinite size system while it is not the case for a two - qubit model .",
    "moreover , the pairwise entanglement can be defined as symmetric and non - symmetric ones with differente properties for three - qubit as will be discussed in this article .",
    "in addition to the above facts , recently some novel magnetic systems with antiferromagnetic ( af ) properties , such as @xmath0@xcite , @xmath1@xcite , @xmath2@xcite , @xmath3 , @xmath4@xcite and @xmath5@xcite , were discovered in the category of quasi - one dimensional materials which are known to belong to an antisymmetric interaction of the form @xmath6 which is known as the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm)interaction@xcite .",
    "thus , investigation of the quantum effects in such spin models requires more research in this direction .    in this paper , we have investigated the influence of the the anisotropy coupling , magnetic field and the @xmath7-component dm interaction on the non - symmetric ( @xmath8 ) and symmetric pairwise ( @xmath9 ) ground state and thermal entanglement of the three - qubit @xmath10 and ising models in a magnetic field and in the presence of dm interaction .",
    "we will show that the dm interaction , anisotropy and magnetic field parameters are efficient control parameters of entanglement . increasing the dm coupling and anisotropy have a different effects on the entanglement and can enhance or reduce the entanglement , whereas these parameter just increase the entanglement in two - qubit @xcite counterpart .",
    "however we show that at @xmath11 the 3-qubit quantum phase transition points of this system correspond to those ones at thermodynamic limit@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of n - qubit @xmath10 model with @xmath7-component of dm interaction is    [ eq4 ] h(,)=_i^n , where @xmath12 is the exchange coupling , @xmath13 is the strength of @xmath7 component dm interaction and @xmath14 defines the easy - axis anisotropy which can be positive or negative .",
    "the positive or negative @xmath12 corresponds to the antiferromagnetic ( af ) or ferromagnetic ( f ) cases , respectively .",
    "@xmath15 refers to the @xmath16-component of pauli matrix at site @xmath17 .",
    "a @xmath18-rotation around @xmath7 axis on odd ( or even ) sites maps the f case ( @xmath19 ) to the af case with the opposite sign of anisotropy , [ eq5 ] h(j,)=_i^n ,  j=||>0 .",
    "so we can restrict ourselves to af case ( @xmath20 ) with @xmath21 and arbitrary anisotropy ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) without loss of generality .",
    "we can also restore the ising model with dm interaction ( idm ) in the limit @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian is given by [ eq5-b ] h(,)=_i^n .",
    "it should be noticed that both af ( corresponds to the positive anisotropy in @xmath10 with @xmath26 ) and f cases ( corresponds to the negative anisotropy in @xmath10 with @xmath26 ) have to be considered separately , since the mentioned symmetry can not be justified for eq.([eq5-b ] ) .",
    "we will consider the above hamiltonians ( eqs.([eq5 ] , [ eq5-b ] ) ) on a string of 3-qubits and obtain the entanglement of them in terms of the model parameters .",
    "the entanglement of two - qubit can be measured by the concurrence which is defined as@xcite [ eq1 ] c_ij=\\{2(_k)-_k=1 ^ 4_k,0 } where @xmath27 ( k=1,2,3,4 ) are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the following operator [ eq2 ] r=_ij(_i^y_j^y)_ij^(_i^y_j^y ) , @xmath28 is the density matrix of pair @xmath17 and @xmath29 spins and asterisk denotes the complex conjugate . for a system in equilibrium at temperature @xmath30 the state of a system",
