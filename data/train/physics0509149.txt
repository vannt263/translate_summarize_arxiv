    "in recent literature a lot of attention has been given to systems that are able to sense electromagnetic near fields ( evanescent waves ) and even to `` amplify '' them .",
    "the superlens proposed by pendry@xcite is one of such systems .",
    "his superlens is based on a veselago medium@xcite slab .",
    "the real parts of the permittivity and the permeability of the veselago slab are both negative at a certain wavelength .",
    "thus , the eigenwaves in the slab are _ backward _ waves , i.e. the wave phase and group velocities are antiparallel .",
    "this provides negative refraction and focusing of waves in a planar slab , as was outlined by veselago.@xcite however , pendry discovered that there was also a possibility to excite surface plasmon - polaritons on the slab surfaces and , due to that , amplify near fields@xcite .",
    "the slab thickness can be of the order of the wavelength , so that the plasmon - polaritons excited at both sides of the slab are strongly coupled . under certain conditions the plasmon - polariton excited at the back surface of the slab has a much stronger amplitude than that at the front surface .",
    "such amplification of evanescent waves is the key principle in subwavelength imaging .",
    "known experimental realizations of volumetric artificial materials with negative parameters are highly anisotropic structures that utilize dense arrays of parallel thin conducting wires and variations of split - ring resonators@xcite",
    ". proposed isotropic arrangements use orthogonal sets of split rings@xcite and also three - dimensional arrays of wires@xcite . at the same time , there have been achievements in modeling of veselago materials ( and pendry lens ) with the help of @xmath0-circuits or transmission - line ( tl ) based structures.@xcite these networks do not rely on resonant response from particular inclusions , and the period of the mesh can be made very small as compared with the wavelength .",
    "these features allow realization of broadband and low - loss devices , which is extremely difficult if resonant inclusions are used .",
    "the transmission - line network approach has been successfully realized in one- and two - dimensional networks , but up to now there have been doubts if it is possible to design a three - dimensional ( 3d ) circuit analogy of the veselago medium .",
    "the difficulties arise from the fact that such a 3d network requires a common ground connector .",
    "any realization of such a ground will effectively work as a dense mesh of interconnected conductors that blocks propagation of the electromagnetic waves practically the same way as a solid metal does ( the structural period must be much less than the wavelength in order to realize an effectively uniform artificial material ) . in this paper",
    "we introduce isotropic three - dimensional transmission - line networks that overcome this difficulty .    in the tl - based networks that we study , the electromagnetic energy propagates through tl sections .",
    "the inside of every tl section is effectively screened from the inside of the other sections and from the outer space .",
    "this can be very naturally imagined with a 3d cubic - cell network of interconnected coaxial cable segments : the inner conductors of the segments are soldered at the network nodes ; the same is done for the outer conductors .",
    "the whole system appears as a 3d pipe network where every pipe holds a central conductor and those conductors are crossing at the node points inside the pipes .",
    "a loaded tl network can be realized now by placing loading elements inside the `` pipes '' . to couple the waves propagating inside the tl sections with the free - space waves one will have to apply a kind of antenna array with every antenna feeding a particular tl segment .    when using transmission lines loaded with bulk elements we speak of waves in the meaning of discrete waves of voltages and currents defined at the loading positions .",
    "let us note that in the tl sections _ as such _ the usual , forward waves propagate . only because of the loading the discrete voltage and current waves appear as backward ones when appropriate loading impedances are used .",
    "while completing this manuscript , we learned about another possible design of a 3d transmission - line analogy of a backward - wave material described in ref .",
    "that design is based on kron s formal representation of maxwell s equations as an equivalent electric circuit.@xcite in ref .",
    "12 only 1d propagation was studied analytically and 3d properties were analyzed numerically .",
    "the proposed structure of 3d super - resolution lens consists of two forward - wave ( fw ) regions and one backward - wave ( bw ) region .",
    "the 3d forward - wave networks can be realized with simple transmission lines and the 3d backward - wave network with inductively and capacitively loaded transmission lines .",
    "one unit cell of the bw network is shown in fig .",
    "[ 3d_zy_tl_unit_cell ] ( the unit cell enclosed by the dotted line ) . in the 3d structure",

    "such approximation is possible at low frequencies . without the transmission line segments",
