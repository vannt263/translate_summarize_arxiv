    "entanglement generation , be it for atoms or photons , spurs a great deal of interest in quantum information processing@xcite and quantum cryptography@xcite",
    ". fundamental tests of quantum mechanics often require the presence of highly entangled states . for many practical purposes ,",
    "the polarisation states of photons provide the most favoured qubits@xcite .",
    "the reason is that photons possess very long lifetimes and an ease in distribution .",
    "the main disadvantage of employing photons is that it is difficult to create an effective interaction between them and hence they are difficult to entangle . nevertheless , in recent years",
    ", much progress has been made in the development of sources for the generation of multiphoton entanglement@xcite and the generation of single photons on demand@xcite .    the most common way to create mulitphoton entanglement",
    "is to generate the photons within the same source .",
    "this applies to parametric downconversion@xcite , which is currently used in many experiments , and to the atomic cascade@xcite , which was the first source demonstrating a violation of bell s famous inequality@xcite .",
    "parametric downconversion schemes are in principle scalable to multiphoton entanglement . however , this is intrinsically inefficient@xcite .",
    "another way to _ probabilistically _ produce multiphoton entanglement is to create single photons on demand using strongly coupled atom - cavity systems@xcite or quantum dot technology@xcite .",
    "afterwards these photons are brought to overlap on a beamsplitter within their coherence time and a successful postselective and entangling measurement should be performed on the output ports@xcite . schemes for the generation of photon entanglement with linear - optics setups are widely known@xcite and offer the advantage of being able to tailor a variety of multiphoton states .",
    "the main disadvantage of these schemes is that they are non - deterministic and the probability for the successful generation of a certain multiphoton state decreases in general rapidly with the number of photons involved .",
    "schemes that are less flexible but allow for the _ deterministic _ generation of multiphoton entanglement have been proposed by gheri",
    "_ et al._@xcite and lange and kimble@xcite .",
    "both proposals require only a single atom - cavity system and employ certain features of the photon generation process .",
    "the basic idea is to prepare the atom in a superposition of ground states which is then mapped step by step onto the state of each newly generated photon . during this process , the state of the first photon is highly entangled with the state of the atom inside the resonator .",
    "the state of each subsequently created photon can thus become strongly correlated to the state of all the others . in order to produce @xmath0 entangled photons usuable as qubits ,",
    "the schemes@xcite require to subsequently perform at least @xmath0 coherent operations on the same atom - cavity system and they are therefore relatively sensitive to decoherence in the case of the generation of several photons .    here , we describe a scheme that allows for the generation of @xmath0 highly entangled photons in @xmath0 spatially separated modes of the free radiation field in a _ push button_-like experiment .",
    "we are able to engineer a wide range of multiphoton states which could then directly be used as an input for linear optics quantum computing schemes or quantum cryptography .",
    "the experimental setup consists of @xmath0 identical atom - cavity systems and we assume that the frequency is for all photons the same .",
    "the proposed scheme is very robust and requires essentially only the following two steps .",
    "initially , the atoms have to be prepared in a highly entangled stable ground state",
    ". this initialisation step can be realised with the help of postselective measurements on the collective emission from the cavities through a multiport beamsplitter .",
    "once successfull , another set of @xmath0 photons can be generated using the same procedure as for the generation of single photons on demand@xcite . during this step",
    ", the state of the atoms is mapped onto the state of @xmath0 newly generated photons .    as in the entangled photon pair creation scheme by lim and beige@xcite ,",
    "there is no need for the photons to be emitted at the same time .",
    "furthermore , the adiabatic passage used for the excitation of the cavity mode can be performed with a very high fidelity@xcite .",
    "the scheme is resilient against phase errors , i.e.  there is no need to control the relative phases between the different atom - cavity systems , since the initial state is a product state and phase fluctuations only affect a global phase with no physical consequences .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     as an example , we now describe the preparation of two atom - cavity systems in a maximally entangled state .",
    "this state can then be used as an input state for the generation of a maximally entangled photon pair on demand . the corresponding experimental setup for the initialisation step",
    "is shown in figure [ exsetup ] .",
    "for the simple case @xmath1 , the multiport beamsplitter consists only of a single 50:50 beamsplitter and the transition matrix elements @xmath2 become @xmath3 .",
    "initially , the system should be prepared in the state @xmath4 .",
    "afterwards , the stirap process described above , transfers the system according to eq .",
    "( [ ski ] ) into the state @xmath5 ~.\\ ] ] suppose , a `` @xmath6 '' polarised photon is detected at detector @xmath7 and a `` @xmath8 '' polarised photon is detected in detector @xmath9 , then the state of the system becomes @xmath10 ~,\\ ] ] which describes two atoms in a maximally entangled state .",
    "the same maximally entangled state of the atoms is also prepared in the case where a `` @xmath8 '' polarised photon is measured at detector @xmath7 and a `` @xmath6 '' polarised photon is measured at detector @xmath9 .",
    "the probability that both detectors find a photon with the same polarisation equals zero and the probability for the initialisation step to be successful is close to @xmath11 for a wide range of experimental parameters .",
    "suppose the system has already been prepared in a highly entangled state @xmath12 involving only the atomic ground states @xmath13 and @xmath14 while there are no photons in the resonators .",
    "mapping of this state onto the state of @xmath0 newly generated photons then requires only a single @xmath15-polarised laser pulse coupling simultaneously to the @xmath16 and the @xmath17 transition of each atom .",
    "at the same time , the cavity field should interact with the @xmath18 and the @xmath19 transition of each atom .",
    "the corresponding time evolution for atom - cavity system @xmath20 is then described by the hamiltonian @xmath21 the mapping process consists of a simple stirap process , as described in section 2 , and should be applied to all atom - cavity systems simultaneously . for simplicity , we assume again that the cavity coupling constants @xmath22 are for all transitions and subsystems the same",
    ". then the effect of the so - called counterintuitive pulse sequence on system @xmath20 corresponds in direct analogy to eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) to the operator @xmath23 note that the mapping step transfers each initial state of the form @xmath24 into a state with all atoms in @xmath25 and one photon with @xmath26 in cavity 1 , one photon with @xmath27 in cavity 2 and so on .",
    "since the underlying stirap process is coherent , the final state is a superposition of all these states",
    ".    once created , one photon leaks out through the outcoupling mirror of each cavity into a separate mode of the free radiation field .",
    "thereby the state of the system becomes @xmath28 defined by eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) . the probability for the generation of the final multiphoton state ( [ map ] )",
    "can , at least in principle , be arbitrarily close to one .",
    "suppose no measurements are performed beyond the outcoupling mirrors of the cavities , whether photons have been created or not .",
    "if the system has initially been prepared in the maximally entangled state ( [ fun ] ) , the final state ( [ map ] ) equals @xmath29 ) is an atomic ground state and its life time is not restricted by spontaneous emission from the atoms .",
    "in recent years , several proposals for the measurement - induced generation of entanglement have been made.@xcite other authors analysed the possibility to map the state of an atom - cavity system onto a photon@xcite . here",
    "we combine all these ideas with a scheme for the generation of single photons on demand@xcite and propose an experiment for the generation of multiphoton entanglement on demand .",
    "a more detailed description of the presented scheme will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
