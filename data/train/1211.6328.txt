    "@xcite it was possible to provide the small polaron model with open boundary conditions while keeping its integrability intact .",
    "these integrable boundary conditions are encoded in @xmath1-number valued @xmath2-matrix solutions to the reflection equations @xcite .",
    "diagonal boundary matrices correspond to boundary chemical potentials in the hamiltonian . in this case",
    "the small polaron model is equivalent to the spin-1/2 xxz heisenberg chain with boundary magnetic fields by means of a jordan - wigner transformation , similarly as in the case of periodic boundary conditions where this equivalence holds up to a boundary twist depending on the particle number @xcite . as a consequence",
    "the spectrum of the open small polaron model can be obtained using bethe ansatz methods @xcite . for general non - diagonal solutions to the reflection equations",
    "this equivalence does not hold as a consequence of the non - local nature of the jordan - wigner transformation .",
    "furthermore , the underlying grading implies that solutions to the reflection equations for the small polaron model are _ super matrices _ @xcite . in the corresponding hamiltonian the resulting additional boundary terms",
    "do not conserve particle number and have anti - commuting scalars , i.e.  odd grassmann numbers , as amplitudes .",
    "the fact that the @xmath0 symmetry of the model is broken implies that in general there is no simple eigenstate ( e.g.  the fock vacuum ) of the model which can be used as a reference state for the algebraic bethe ansatz .",
    "therefore , alternative approaches such as functional bethe ansatz methods have to be employed to analyze the spectrum of the model .",
    "this situation is , in fact , very similar to the case of non - diagonal boundary magnetic fields in the spin-@xmath3 heisenberg chains : in the approaches used so far the solution of the spectral problem relies on constraints between the boundary fields at the two ends of the chain or restrictions on the anisotropy , or it is limited to small finite systems thereby reducing their usefulness to study this system in the thermodynamic limit @xcite . in a previous publication @xcite",
    "we have investigated the applicability of bethe ansatz methods in the simpler case of a model of free fermions with similar open boundary conditions .",
    "we found that for a certain class of non - diagonal boundary super matrices , a unitary transformation on the auxiliary space allowed for an exact solution of the free fermion model .",
    "furthermore , the functional equations obtained there could be easily generalized to describe the spectrum of the model for arbitrary non - diagonal boundary fields .",
    "unfortunatley , this approach can not be applied directly to the small polaron model .    in the present paper",
    "we initiate a study as to whether the nilpotency of the off - diagonal boundary parameters in a graded model allows to bypass some of the problems arising in the case of the spin-1/2 xxz chain with non - diagonal boundary fields .",
    "following ideas @xcite developed in the context of the spin-1/2 xxz heisenberg chain and later generalized to the xyz chain @xcite and integrable higher spin xxz models @xcite we adapt the fusion procedure @xcite for the transfer matrix of the quantum chain to the graded case of the small polaron model .",
    "we derive the fusion hierarchy of functional equations for a commuting family of transfer matrices for the small polaron model . assuming the existence of a certain limit we formulate the spectral problem of this model for periodic and general open boundary conditions in terms of functional tq - equations . for periodic and diagonal open boundary conditions these equations",
    "are shown to coincide with the known result obtained from using the algebraic bethe ansatz .",
    "for special values of the interaction parameter related to roots of unity of the anisotropy parameter we derive truncation identities for the fusion of the relevant objects , in particular the transfer matrices . using these identities",
    "the fusion hierarchy reduces to a set of relations between finitely many quantities .",
