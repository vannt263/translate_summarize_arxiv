    "it is well known that this kind of modeling with differential equations is valid only if _ one unity _ of @xmath1 ( or @xmath6 ) represents a _ large number _ of prey ( or predator ) _",

    "large _ is generally not specified but it is widely admitted that around @xmath7 the law of large numbers begins to do its job and that figures like @xmath8 are completely safe if one wants to use continuous variables and differential equations . +   + the objective of this paper is to show that the threshold of @xmath7 is not always acceptable and that , in some circumstances , even @xmath8 can not be considered as secure when we deduce biological consequences , like persistence , from the behavior of a model with continuous variables . for that purpose",
    "we propose a stochastic model , where the dynamic of the prey is governed by a birth and death process while , for mathematical simplicity , we keep the predator variable as a continuous one .",
    "the development will make clear that this simplification does not affect the conclusions of the paper .",
    "the proposed model is such that the dynamic of the process is locally approximated ( when the number of preys is large ) by a differential system which is precisely of predator - prey type like ( [ syst1 ] ) .",
    "we agree that , in many respects , our model is biologically questionable but our objective is not to contribute to biological understanding of prey - predator relationship but just to point out some mathematical phenomenon which is likely to be present in many models and which might be responsible for erroneous interpretations .",
    "+   + the first section is devoted to the presentation of the stochastic model , the second to the presentation of some surprising simulations , the third to the analysis of the differential system that governs the dynamics of the mean of the stochastic process and the forth to the explanations of the surprising aspects of the simulations .",
    "the last two sections are devoted to methodological and bibliographical comments .",
    "+   + from the mathematical point of view the material and results presented here are classical .",
    "the paper is intended principally for non mathematically oriented readers who are not necessarily aware of these questions .",
    "we tried to avoid all mathematical technicalities and for this purpose we made an important use of results from computer simulations .",
    "all the references to existing literature related to these questions are rejected to the last two sections .",
    "the variable @xmath9 is an integer which is the number of preys at time @xmath10 .",

    "+   + assume that @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 is of the order of unity . then , during elapsed time @xmath22 the number of events ( death or birth ) is of the order of @xmath23 .",
    "this is a bit lengthy to simulate ( at least with a desk computer ) but , due to that great number of events , the process defined by ( [ lambda ] ) , ( [ proba ] ) , ( [ vary ] ) is accurately approximated on the interval @xmath24 $ ] by the diffusion process ( see appendix a for a derivation ) :    @xmath25-\\sigma_x w_t   \\\\[8pt ]   \\displaystyle y(t+dt)&= & y(t ) + dt [ ( \\mu(x(t))-m)y(t)]+ \\sigma_y w_t     \\end{array }   \\right .\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 is a sequence of independent gaussian variables with mean @xmath27 and standard deviation @xmath28 with :    @xmath29    @xmath30 this diffusion process is not a good approximation of the jump process when @xmath1 is small . for an accurate description one must switch to the jump process for small values of @xmath1 but , since this is not our point here ,",
    "we restrict us to the consideration of the stochastic ( with continuous variables ) diffusion like process : @xmath31+\\sigma_x w_t   \\\\[8pt ]   \\displaystyle y(t+dt)&= & y(t ) + dt [ ( \\mu(x(t))-m)y(t)]+ \\sigma_y w_t   \\end{array }   \\right .\\ ] ] the first line in ( [ syst2 ] ) states that when the number of prey is smaller than @xmath28 it has to be @xmath27 .",

    "this model depends on a parameter @xmath0 .",
    "this model has the following properties :    * since the model is derived from the birth and death process @xmath38 is interpreted as the number of individuals for @xmath1 units of preys . *",
    "the standard deviation is proportional to @xmath39 : the biggest is @xmath0 the more `` deterministic '' is the process . *",
    "the diffusion process is degenerate ( i.e. the dimension of the random noise is not @xmath40 but @xmath28 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that only @xmath1 is considered as a discrete variable , not @xmath6 . *",
    "when @xmath38 is large ( greater than @xmath7 ) the dynamic of the model is accurately approximated ( at least for small durations ) by the classical deterministic differential prey - predator model ( [ syst4 ] ) which is the same as system ( [ syst1 ] ) with @xmath41 after a change of time units .",
    "we shall first simulate this system and then explain the observed simulations .",

    "the duration is @xmath51 and @xmath0 is fixed at @xmath52 ( above ) and @xmath53 ( below ) .",

    "we do not see any difference between the two records .",
    "these regular oscillations are those predicted by the deterministic prey - predator model .",
    "since the value of @xmath1 during the oscillations is around @xmath28 which corresponds to such a great number of individuals we are definitely not surprised that the continuous deterministic system is a good approximation .",

    "mixed mode oscillation _ with a random successions of large and small oscillations which could not be produced by a deterministic two dimensional system . with @xmath43",
    "we observe an extinction of the two populations which is confirmed on fig.[fig-3 ] where we observe that none of @xmath54 runs for @xmath43 is persistent at time @xmath55 .",

    "[ table-1 ] we have the empirical probabilities of extinction with respect to @xmath0 ( computed on 1000 runs ) and mean and standard deviation of @xmath56 computed on trajectories ending with extinction for @xmath58 .",

    "the results are presented in both @xmath61 and @xmath62 variables ( black trajectories ) . in the same variables we have simulated from system ( [ syst4 ] )",
    "the `` safety trajectory '' corresponding to @xmath57 individuals , that is to say : the  safety trajectory \" was obtained by dichotomy and the observed width @xmath63 of the funnel is given on the table [ table-2 ] with corresponding rough evaluations of @xmath64 and @xmath65 around the funnel .    * * fig.[10 - 9 ] * : all the runs are widely below the `` safety trajectory '' . *",

    "* fig.[10 - 7 ] * : all the runs are widely above the `` safety trajectory '' and reach ultimately the vertical line corresponding to @xmath28 individual .    we observe that when @xmath0 decreases the strength of the randomness increases and at the same time the width of the funnel decreases .",
    "these opposite trends are responsible for the sharp transition from extinction to persistence as @xmath0 grows from @xmath66 to @xmath67 .",
    "we are used to the fact that continuous differential models works rather well in fluid dynamics and chemical kinetics despite the ultimate discrete nature of fluids . we know that this efficiency is related to the very large number of atoms in the process .",
    "von foerster , lotka , volterra and others popularized the formalism of chemical kinetics in the domain of population dynamics ; they were certainly aware of the limits of such an approach but , in the absence of computers and with a far less developed probability theory , it was a way to progress .",
    "+   + now , thanks to computers and probability theory , we have good models for small populations .",
    "unfortunately these models are still expensive in term of computer time and deterministic or diffusion models ( stochastic differential equations ) with continuous variable are still unavoidable . in a diffusion model the size of the population considered is directly related to the strength ( standard deviation ) of the random term .",
    "+   + _ the example of prey - predator interaction presented here shows that the qualitative behavior of such models may depend strongly on the size of the population even when it is very large .",
    "_      the deterministic prey - predator model ( [ syst4 ] ) approximate the dynamics for @xmath68 $ ] and @xmath69 $ ] of the birth and death model defined by ( [ lambda ] ) , ( [ proba ] ) , ( [ vary ] ) and its diffusion approximation ( [ syst2 ] ) .",
    "this model ( [ syst4 ] ) is the very classical deterministic prey - predator model which is proposed in every text book as a first improvement of the lotka - volterra model .",
    "the separation of time scales for prey and predator dynamics introduced by the presence of the parameter @xmath17 in the first equation has the following classical explanation . using a change of time unit ( [ syst4 ] ) rewrites : @xmath70 \\\\[8pt ]   \\displaystyle \\frac{dy}{d\\tau}&= & \\varepsilon ( \\mu(x ) - \\delta)y\\;\\;\\;;\\;\\;\\ ; \\varepsilon m = \\delta      \\end{array }   \\right .\\ ] ] if we use the same mass unit for @xmath1 and @xmath6 then @xmath17 is a yield factor .",
    "a yield factor like @xmath71 is acceptable in ecology ( one needs @xmath72 kg . of dry grass to get @xmath28 kg . of cow ) . for bigger @xmath17 like @xmath73 the sharp transition that we presented",
    "is still present but less spectacular .",
    "+   + as previously said we admit that our birth and death model is questionable with respect to its biological signification .",
    "there are certainly many different models for individual behavior with the same deterministic equation approximating the mean of the process .",
    "since our point relies on the diffusion approximation for such models our conclusions are valid as long as such approximation is correct . in the case of birth and death processes it works provided that the number of individuals is greater than @xmath7-@xmath74 which is our case . for more elaborated models at the individual scale ( for instance physiologically structured preys ) this point remains to be considered .",
    "let us say two words about `` canard solutions '' .",
    "in a system with two time scales like : @xmath75 \\\\[8pt ]   \\displaystyle \\frac{dy}{dt}&= & g(x , y )    \\end{array }   \\right .\\ ] ] consider the curve @xmath76 defined by the equation @xmath77 ; this curve split in two regions :    * the attracting one made of points such that , in the neighborhood , the vector field converges to @xmath76 , * the repelling one made of points where , in the neighborhood , the vector field diverges from @xmath76 ,    separated by equilibria .",
    "`` canard '' _ solution is a solution of the differential system which follows , for some duration , the attracting part of @xmath76 at a distance of the order of @xmath17 and , after that , _ follows also _ the repelling part at a distance of order @xmath17 .",
    "some `` canards '' are _ robust _ which means that they persist under small changes in the model , others are not . +   +",
    "the presence of a `` safety funnel '' like the one described in section @xmath78 is related to the presence of two `` canard solutions '' in ( [ syst4 ] ) .    *",
    "the solution @xmath79 which corresponds to the absence of prey , * a solution following the cubic from the right to the left , which has no analytic expression but which existence can be proved by continuity arguments .",
    "the first `` canard '' is robust but the second is not .",
    "this is the reason why , the sharp transition between @xmath66 and @xmath67 individuals occurs for a rather short interval of values of the parameter @xmath46 . as a consequence , to some extend",
    ", our example is exceptional , not `` generic ''",
    ". this will be the case in most two dimensional systems , but this do not invalid our point since robust `` canard '' ( different from trivial `` canard '' corresponding to the absence of some population ) are generically present for dimension @xmath78 and more .",
    "( above left , right ) @xmath80 ( below left , right),width=377 ]    an easy way to understand it is to imagine that our parameter @xmath46 is of the form : @xmath81 which mimics , for instance , some seasonal dependence of the mortality rate .",
    "this non autonomous system can be considered as a three dimensional system and we see that the `` canard '' value for @xmath46 is crossed periodically . we have done a simulation in the case : @xmath82 and the results are shown on fig [ fig21 ] .",
    "for @xmath83 we observe no difference between the deterministic model ( @xmath1 in blue , @xmath6 in black ) and the diffusion approximation ( @xmath1 in red , @xmath6 in black ) ; for @xmath84 we observe a very slight deviation between red and blue curves ; for @xmath85 we observe a very big difference with now a mixed mode oscillation in the diffusion process ; for @xmath3 the mixed mode oscillation leads to extinction .      in population dynamics",
    "every body agrees that deterministic models are just crude approximations of reality . only individually based models , stochastic by essence ,",
    "can represent correctly the evolution of real ecosystems .",
    "the example presented here is just one more argument against the danger of using deterministic differential equations without care .",
    "+   + _ but it is by no mean an argument against the study of continuous deterministic differential models of populations dynamics ! _ +   + actually there are many good reasons for continuing to explore systems of ordinary differential equations :    * some models are mathematically appealing . for instance the proof of the exclusion principle for the most general model of competition in the chemostat @xcite , despite its poor ecological contents , remains an interesting mathematical challenge for mathematicians . *",
    "more interesting is the use of easily tractable mathematical models to formalize some ecological issue and clarify the discussion .",
    "an interesting example of this use of differential equations is given by the discussion on `` ratio dependent '' models initiated by the paper of ardity and ginsburg @xcite .",
    "* in our example , the understanding of the diffusion model , relies on very particular and recently ( see bibliographical comments ) discovered properties of _ deterministic _ differential systems : the `` canard solutions '' .    by the way ,",
    "far from being an article of propaganda against the use of deterministic differential systems , our paper supports the importance of a thorough understanding of the properties of ordinary differential systems in population dynamics .",
    "in particular it shows that the classical deterministic definition of persistence : @xmath86 must be enriched by some consideration about the `` size '' of @xmath87 .",
    "there is no doubt that our mathematical understanding of the phenomena outlined in the present paper will considerably increase in the future . but",
    "this will require high mathematical sophistication and time .",
    "unfortunately , in the mean time , biologist will use models and computer simulations which are not completely safe .",
    "it urges to provide them with computer routines which are safe of numerical artifacts associated to the true nature of a population : _ a more or less large number of individuals_. considering our present mathematical knowledge this certainly can be done in a comparatively short time but it needs quite a lot of people working on the design of safe computer software .",
    "this was done in the past for the needs of industry ( for instance digital wind tunnels ) , medicin ( medical imaging ) this could be the case for microbial ecology but it depends of decisions at the level of scientific policies .",
    "the question of the inadequacy of deterministic continuous modeling is firmly addressed by d. mollison @xcite in a paper which criticize the biological interpretations of a previous paper by murray et al .",
