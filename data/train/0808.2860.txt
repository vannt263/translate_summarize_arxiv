    "the recent development of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ( grmhd ) codes ( e.g. , @xcite ) has finally allowed realistic numerical simulations of magnetized accretion disks around black holes ( bhs ) .",
    "this has led to a better understanding of the inner regions of these disks ( e.g. @xcite ) and of their role in launching relativistic jets ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one of the interesting new results is the recognition that magnetic fields alter the structure of the accretion flow near and inside the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "this may result in large deviations from the traditional picture of a vanishing torque at the isco @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggested that the zero - torque condition is likely to be a good approximation for geometrically thin disks .",
    "this was confirmed by @xcite who , using a global height - integrated model , showed that modifications to the stress profile are negligibly small for disk thicknesses @xmath3 less than about a tenth of the local radius @xmath4 .",
    "their work was , however , based on a hydrodynamic model with @xmath5-viscosity and did not explicitly include magnetic fields .",
    "numerical mhd simulations by @xcite using a pseudo - newtonian potential , and by @xcite using a grmhd code , indicated that magnetic torques are indeed important inside the isco .",
    "in particular , these authors found no evidence for a `` stress edge , '' leading them to argue that simple disk models based on the zero - torque condition ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter nt73 ) may be seriously wrong . if true this would undermine recent efforts to estimate of the spin parameters of bhs using the nt73 model @xcite .",
    "the mhd simulations carried out so far have considered non - radiating accretion flows that are geometrically rather thick .",
    "the one exception is the recent work of @xcite who considered a thin disk with @xmath6 in a pseudo - newtonian potential . in this paper , we describe global 3d grmhd simulations of a thin disk ( @xmath7 ) around a non - spinning bh and compare our simulated model with the nt73 model .",
    "we use units with @xmath8 , e.g. the horizon is at @xmath9 and the isco is at @xmath10 . we report results in boyer - lindquist ( bl ) coordinates ( @xmath11 , @xmath4 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) , referred to as the coordinate frame . in the expressions below",
    "@xmath14 refers to the determinant of the metric .",
    "the fluid @xmath15-velocity and the magnetic field @xmath15-vector ( see , e.g. , @xcite for definitions ) are given by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and the rest - mass density , internal energy density , thermal pressure , and magnetic pressure as measured in the fluid comoving frame are @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 with adiabatic index @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "the total pressure is @xmath23 .",
    "simulations were performed using a 3d grmhd code harm @xcite in kerr - schild coordinates using the interpolation scheme described by @xcite , inversion scheme described by @xcite and @xcite , and other advances described by @xcite . for our fiducial model we used a 3d grid with resolution @xmath24 corresponding to : ( i ) 512 cells in @xmath4 , logarithmically spaced from @xmath25 to @xmath26 with `` outflow '' boundary conditions ; ( ii ) 128 cells in @xmath12 going from 0 to @xmath27 , non - uniformly spaced so that roughly half the cells are concentrated in the disk\\pi/2 $ ] for code coordinate @xmath28 with @xmath29 , giving roughly @xmath30 more angular resolution compared to equation  ( 8) with @xmath31 in @xcite . ] ; ( iii ) 32 cells in @xmath13 , uniformly spaced from @xmath32 to @xmath33 .",
    "cells at the disk equator had physical sizes roughly in the ratio of 2:1:7 in @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , which ensured that the turbulence was roughly isotropic in cartesian coordinates , optimal for accurately resolving the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) . to test convergence",
    "we also used resolutions of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "we also carried out 2d simulations with resolution of up to @xmath40 , but we do not discuss these results because turbulence decayed on an orbital time - scale ( i.e. cowling s anti - dynamo theorem holds ) .",
    "we began the simulation with an equilibrium torus @xcite with inner edge at @xmath41 and pressure maximum at @xmath42 and adjusted the model parameters so the torus had @xmath43 at @xmath44 .",
    "we found that placing the torus at a smaller radius led to results too sensitive to the initial mass distribution .",
    "we define @xmath45 to be the density - weighted root mean square angular thickness of the disk at any given @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath46^{1/2 } , \\label{hoverr}\\ ] ] or written as @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "we also consider the mean density - weighted thickness : @xmath49 .",
    "we embedded the torus with a weak magnetic field with @xmath50 .",
    "the initial field consisted of two poloidal loops centered at @xmath51 and @xmath52 to model a disorganized field with no net flux .",
    "( during the simulation , there is no organized flux threading the disk but some organized flux threads the bh . )",
    "the field strength was randomly perturbed by 50% to seed the mri instability .",
    "recent grmhd simulations @xcite indicate that the results for the disk ( but not the jet ) should be roughly independent of the initial field geometry .",
    "the mri is initially resolved with much of the torus having @xmath53 cells per wavelength of the fastest growing mri mode .    in order to keep the accretion disk thin , an ad hoc cooling / heating function was added to the energy - momentum equations as a covariant source term ( @xmath54 ) with @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the fluid proper time .",
    "the gas cooling time ( @xmath57 ) was set to @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the keplerian frequency .",
    "thus the gas was driven towards @xmath60 , which we defined as that value of @xmath19 for which the specific entropy of the gas would be equal to the constant specific entropy ( e.g. , @xmath61 ) of the initial solution .",
    "the simulation ran for a time of @xmath62 , corresponding to @xmath63 orbits at the isco ( @xmath64 ) and @xmath65 orbits at the initial inner edge of the torus .",
    "the results reported here correspond to averages computed over the period @xmath66 , when the accretion flow had reached a quasi - steady state inside a radius of about @xmath67 .",
    "figure  [ thicknessplot ] shows that the simulated disk had a thickness ( given by eq .",
    "[ thickness ] ) of @xmath68 over the radius range of interest .",
    "the mean absolute thickness @xmath69 was smaller : @xmath70 . at the isco",
    ", the two definitions of thickness gave @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "( eq . [ thickness ] ) as a function of radius @xmath4 ( solid line ) .",
    "simulation results were averaged over the time interval @xmath66 .",
    "also shown is the mean absolute thickness @xmath69 ( dashed line ) .",
    "the vertical dotted line corresponds to the position of the isco .",
    "the initial torus had its inner edge at @xmath72.,width=316 ]",
    "the flux of mass and specific angular momentum are given by @xmath73 respectively , where @xmath74 is the @xmath4-@xmath13 component of the stress - energy tensor , and @xmath75 the specific energy flux @xmath76 is found by replacing @xmath77 with @xmath78 in the above equations . in equation ( [ ldot ] ) , the term @xmath79 represents the specific angular momentum advected inward with the accretion flow .",
    "similarly , @xmath80 represents outflow of specific angular momentum as a result of the magnetic shear stress . in steady state ,",
    "each of these terms is independent of @xmath11 , and their sum is independent of both @xmath4 and @xmath11 .     of the inflowing magnetized gas ( solid line ) , compared to the idealized profile assumed in the nt73 disk model ( dashed line ) .",
    "the horizontal dotted curve shows the net flux of angular momentum @xmath81 .",
    "this is independent of @xmath4 up to @xmath82 , indicating the simulation has achieved steady state well - beyond the isco.,width=316 ]    figure  [ angmmtm ] compares the time - averaged profile of @xmath79 from the simulation , averaged over an angular range @xmath83 around the disk mid - plane ( 2 to 3 density scale heights ) , with that predicted by nt73 . in the latter ,",
    "@xmath79 is equal to the keplerian specific angular momentum for all radii down to the isco ; inside the isco , @xmath79 is taken to be constant since , by assumption , no angular momentum is removed from the gas in the plunging region .",
    "the @xmath79 profile from the simulation shows modest deviations from this idealized profile : ( i ) @xmath79 is slightly sub - keplerian outside the isco ; ( ii ) @xmath79 continues to decrease for a range of @xmath4 inside the isco ; ( iii ) @xmath79 becomes essentially independent of @xmath4 close to the horizon .",
    "the surprising feature of fig .",
    "2 is that the two curves are so close to each other inside the isco . while it is true that the profile of @xmath79 from the simulation drops inside the isco to a value of @xmath84 , this value is only 2.0% less than the nt73 value of @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the magnetic coupling that technically operates inside @xmath86 does not have much real effect on the accreting gas . at the isco @xmath87 , which is @xmath88 of @xmath79 .",
    "further , @xmath76 at the horizon is @xmath89 , which is only slightly different from the nt73 value of @xmath90 , showing that the accretion efficiency is not enhanced by magnetic fields . for two - dimensional simulations of thicker disks with @xmath91 , @xcite found that @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "it appears that @xmath94 deviates from the nt73 value roughly proportional to @xmath45 and so thinner disks should be even closer to nt73 .",
    "these results are converged since , between a resolution of @xmath95 and @xmath96 , the value of @xmath94 changes by less than @xmath97 and @xmath76 changes by less than @xmath98 .",
    "viscosity coefficient ( solid line ) .",
    "the non - zero stress in the plunging region causes only a minor deviation from the nt73 result for the flux of specific angular momentum.,width=316 ]    figure  [ fluidstress ] shows the time - average of the normalized shear stress @xmath99 where @xmath100 as equation ( 5.6.1b ) in nt73 and @xmath101 is the orthonormal stress - energy tensor components in the comoving frame .",
    "we restrict the integral to fluid with @xmath102 , i.e. , only gravitationally bound fluid ( no disk wind ) ; this lowers the value of @xmath103 near the horizon by 50% .",
    "figure  [ fluidstress ] also shows the space - time averaged viscosity parameter @xmath104 that is roughly @xmath105 outside the isco . between the isco and @xmath106 , @xmath5 rises to @xmath107 and finally drops to @xmath108 near the horizon .",
    "there are non - vanishing stresses inside the isco and the `` stress edge '' is near the horizon .",
    "these stresses appear due to organized magnetic flux , but evidently do not cause significant transport of angular momentum ( fig .",
    "[ angmmtm ] ) and are not expected to be a significant source of dissipation and radiation .    another way of evaluating the degree of coupling is to consider , by analogy with steady state flows , the locations of `` critical points , '' defined as the radii at which various volume - averaged outgoing characteristic speeds vanish in the coordinate frame . for our grmhd simulation ,",
    "the fast magnetosonic radius is located at @xmath109 showing that , even for this relatively thin accretion disk , magnetic fields do enhance the communication between the disk and the plunging region . on the other hand ,",
    "the alfvn critical point is much further out at @xmath110 . since alfvn waves play an important role in angular momentum transport",
    ", this suggests that the shear coupling via magnetic fields is weak , unlike the suggestion of @xcite and @xcite .    for fitting disk models to observations",
    "the most useful quantity is the rate of dissipation of energy as a function of radius , since this is what determines the radiation emitted by the accretion disk . as a simple estimate , consider the standard theory of viscous disks in which the energy dissipation rate is equal to the local shear stress multiplied by @xmath111 ( this is not necessarily valid for an mhd fluid , and is even less valid in the plunging region ) .",
    "in contrast to the standard model , which assumes a vanishing torque at the isco , we find @xmath112 at @xmath113 .",
    "this modification to the inner boundary condition will cause the luminosity of the disk outside the isco to increase by about 4% .    , which measures the relative magnitude of turbulent fluctuations in the accreting gas .",
    "the fluid becomes mostly laminar inside the isco.,width=316 ]    figure  [ turbulence ] shows one measure of the magnitude of turbulent fluctuations , @xmath114 time and angle - averaged as for fig .  [ angmmtm ] .",
    "we see that the gas at radii @xmath115 is highly turbulent due to the mri",
    ". however , the gas flow is fairly smooth at smaller radii , suggesting that there is little dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy inside the isco .",
    "for a geometrically thin accretion disk with @xmath116 ( fig .",
    "1 ) around a non - spinning bh , we find that the specific angular momentum profile @xmath117 of the accreting magnetized gas is quite similar to that assumed in the idealized model of nt73 ( fig .",
    "2 ) . specifically , @xmath79 is slightly smaller than , but nearly equal to , the keplerian value of @xmath118 for radii outside the isco , and is almost independent of @xmath4 inside the isco . at the bh horizon ,",
    "the value of @xmath79 deviates from the nt73 value by only 2.0% .",
    "this result suggests that the nt73 model is a good approximation for thin disks .",
    "however , fast magnetosonic waves from radii as small as @xmath119 can escape the plunging region and communicate magnetic stresses between the disk and the plunging regions , which means that the zero - torque condition assumed in the nt model is not perfectly valid .",
    "nevertheless , the normalized outward flux of angular momentum @xmath80 at the isco is only @xmath88 of the inward flux @xmath120 .",
    "thus , the magnetic coupling across the isco is quantitatively weak . as a result",
    ", we estimate the luminosity of the disk to be enhanced by no more than a few percent .    we find that turbulent activity is pronounced at radii beyond about @xmath67 , and that the flow is nearly laminar inside the isco .",
    "this suggests that the bulk of the dissipation occurs outside the isco in the disk proper , not in the plunging region . in our next paper we plan to discuss the energy dissipation profile of 3d grmhd simulations , which is ultimately what determines the observed radiation .",
    "future studies should also investigate the dependence of these results on @xmath45 , magnetic field geometry , black hole spin ( e.g. @xcite ) , cooling , resistivity and viscosity , and mass distribution .",
    "the results reported here are in qualitative agreement with those obtained by @xcite .",
    "they carried out a 3d non - relativistic mhd simulation in a pseudo - newtonian potential , whereas ours is a fully relativistic grmhd simulation .",
    "also , their initial torus had its inner radius at the isco , @xmath121 , whereas our torus initially had @xmath72 .",
    "this might explain some differences in our results , e.g. , their turbulence edge is at @xmath122 whereas ours is at @xmath123 ( compare their fig .  3 with our fig .  4 ) .",
    "indeed , we find that our results are sensitive to the initial conditions if we place the inner edge of the torus much inside @xmath124 . despite these differences",
    "the two simulations agree on the main result , viz .",
    ", for a geometrically thin disk , the isco does behave like a physical boundary separating the disk proper from the plunging region .",
    "@xcite suggest a larger deviation from nt73 , but they considered a torus with a larger value of @xmath45 and did not use a self - consistent dissipation model .",
    "a study of the actual dissipation in the simulation , the goal of our next paper , will hopefully resolve these differences .",
