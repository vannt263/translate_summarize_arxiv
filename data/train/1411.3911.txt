    "( it reproduces in part section 2.1 of @xcite ) another similar conjecture is explored - the seemingly almost random behaviour of digits in the base 3 representations of powers @xmath4 .",
    "this conjecture seems to confirm well - it passes even the tests inspired by the central limit theorem and the law of the iterated logarithm .",
    "especially remarkable is fig.[oscilat1 ] below showing oscillations with amplitudes almost as required by the law of the iterated logarithm .    in section [ pi ] , similar pictures for the sequences of digits in the decimal representations of the numbers @xmath0 , @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    "are obtained .",
    "the result looks surprising : instead of oscillations with amplitudes required by the law of the iterated logarithm , we observe _ convergence to zero _ !",
    "if , for such `` analytically '' defined irrational numbers , the observed behaviour remains intact _ ad infinitum _",
    ", then the seeming randomness of their digits is only a limited one .",
    "throughout this section , it is assumed that @xmath9 are positive integers such that @xmath10 is irrational , i.e. , @xmath11 for any integers @xmath12 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath13 the * @xmath14-th digit * in the canonical base @xmath15 representation of the number @xmath16 , and by @xmath17 - the * sum of digits * in this representation .",
    "let us consider base @xmath15 representations of powers @xmath18 .",
    "imagine , for a moment , that , for fixed @xmath19 , most of the digits @xmath20 behave like as statistically independent random variables taking the values @xmath21 with equal probabilities @xmath22 .",
    "then , the ( pseudo ) mean value and ( pseudo ) variance of @xmath20 should be @xmath23 the total number of digits in the base @xmath15 representation of @xmath18 is @xmath24 , hence , the ( pseudo ) mean value of the sum of digits @xmath25 should be @xmath26 and , because of the assumed ( pseudo ) independence of digits , its ( pseudo ) variance should be @xmath27 . as the final consequence , the corresponding centered and normed variable @xmath28 should tend to behave as a standard normally distributed random variable with probability density @xmath29 .",
    "one can try to verify this conclusion experimentally .",
    "for example , let us compute @xmath30 for @xmath16 up to @xmath31 , and let us draw the histogram of the corresponding centered and normed variable @xmath32 ( see fig .",
    "[ histo1 ] ) .",
    "as we see , this variable behaves , indeed , almost exactly , as a standard normally distributed random variable ( the solid curve ) .    ,",
    "scaledwidth=80.0% ]    observing such a phenomenon `` out there '' , one could conjecture that the sum of digits @xmath33 , as a function of @xmath16 , behaves almost as @xmath34 , i.e. , almost * linearly * in @xmath16 .    an even more advanced idea for testing randomness of sequences of digits",
    "was proposed in @xcite - let us use the law of the iterated logarithm .",
    "namely , let us try to estimate the amplitude of the possible deviations of @xmath33 from @xmath34 by `` applying '' the law of the iterated logarithm .",
    "let us consider the following centered and normed ( pseudo ) random variables : @xmath35 by summing up these variables for @xmath14 from @xmath36 to @xmath37 , we obtain a sequence of ( pseudo ) random variables : @xmath38 that  must obey `` the law of the iterated logarithm .",
    "namely , if the sequence @xmath33 behaves , indeed , as a ' ' typical \" sum of equally distributed random variables , then @xmath39 and @xmath40 of the fraction @xmath41 must be @xmath42 and @xmath43 correspondingly ( @xmath44 stands for the natural logarithm ) .",
    "therefore , it seems , we could conjecture that , if @xmath45 then @xmath46    in particular , this would mean that @xmath47 and , for @xmath48 this would mean ( note that @xmath49 ) : @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52    , scaledwidth=80.0% ]    however , the real behaviour of the expression @xmath53 until @xmath54 does not show convergence of oscillations to the segment @xmath55 $ ] ( see fig . [ oscilat1 ] , obtained by juris erenoks ) .",
    "although @xmath53 is oscillating almost as required by the law of the iterated logarithm , very many of its values lay outside the segment @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "could we hope to prove the above estimate of @xmath33 ?",
    "to my knowledge , the best result on this problem is due to c. l. stewart .",
    "it follows from his theorem 2 in @xcite ( put @xmath57 ) , that @xmath58 where the constant @xmath59 can be effectively computed from @xmath60 .",
    "since then , no better than @xmath61 lower bounds of @xmath33 have been proved .",
    "in section [ powers ] above , the central limit theorem ( fig .",
    "[ histo1 ] ) and the law of the iterated logarithm ( fig .",
    "[ oscilat1 ] ) were used to verify the conjecture that the sum of digits of the base 3 representation of @xmath4 behaves closely to the expected behaviour of the sum of the first @xmath16 members of a sequence of independent random variables taking the values @xmath62 with equal probabilities @xmath63 .",
    "imagine , for a moment , that the digits in the decimal representation of some real number x behave , indeed , like as statistically independent random variables taking the values @xmath7 with equal probabilities @xmath8 .",
    "then , the ( pseudo ) mean value and ( pseudo ) variance of @xmath16-th digit would be ( see the formulas above ) @xmath64 and @xmath65 correspondingly . and , the ( pseudo ) mean value of the sum of the first @xmath16 digits @xmath66 would be @xmath67 , and , because of the assumed ( pseudo ) independence of digits , its ( pseudo ) variance would be @xmath68 .",
    "let us try to estimate the amplitude of the possible deviations of @xmath66 from the expected mean @xmath69 by  applying \" the law of the iterated logarithm .",
    "let us introduce the necessary centered and normed ( pseudo ) random variables : @xmath70 ( @xmath71 denotes the @xmath14-th digit ) . by summing up these variables for @xmath14 from @xmath36 to @xmath16",
