    "the extracted fusion barrier distributions have been found to be very sensitive to the structure of the colliding nuclei @xcite , and thus the barrier distribution method has opened up the possibility of exploiting the heavy - ion fusion reaction as a `` quantum tunneling microscope '' in order to investigate both the static and dynamical properties of atomic nuclei .",
    "the same barrier distribution interpretation can be applied to the scattering process as well . in particular ,",

    "we next ask ourselves the question of how best to define a similar test function for a scattering problem . in the pure classical approach , in the limit of a strong coulomb field , the differential cross sections for elastic scattering at @xmath22 is given by , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the rutherford cross section .",
    "thus , the ratio @xmath25 is the classical reflection probability @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , and the appropriate test function for scattering is @xcite , @xmath28 in realistic systems , due to the effect of nuclear distortion , the differential cross section deviates from the rutherford cross section even at energies below the barrier . using the semi - classical perturbation theory , we have derived a semi - classical formula for the backward scattering which takes into account the nuclear effect to the leading order @xcite .",
    "the result for a scattering angle @xmath29 reads , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the total ( coulomb + nuclear ) @xmath32-matrix at energy @xmath2 and angular momentum @xmath33 , with @xmath34 being the usual sommerfeld parameter .",

    ", both functions have a similar , relatively narrow , width , and their integral over @xmath2 is unity .",
    "we may thus consider that the quasi - elastic test function is an excellent analogue of the one for fusion , and we exploit this fact in studying barrier structures in heavy - ion scattering .    in the presence of the channel couplings , the fusion and the quasi - elastic cross sections may be given as a weighted sum of the cross sections for uncoupled eigenchannels , @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the fusion and the elastic cross sections for a potential in the eigenchannel @xmath53 .",

    "there are certain attractive experimental advantages to measuring the quasi - elastic cross section @xmath4 rather than the fusion cross sections @xmath55 to extract a representation of the barrier distribution .",
    "these are : i ) less accuracy is required in the data for taking the first derivative rather than the second derivative , ii ) whereas measuring the fusion cross section requires specialized recoil separators ( electrostatic deflector / velocity filter ) usually of low acceptance and efficiency , the measurement of @xmath4 needs only very simple charged - particle detectors , not necessarily possessing good resolution either in energy or in charge , and iii ) several effective energies can be measured at a single - beam energy , since , in the semi - classical approximation , each scattering angle corresponds to scattering at a certain angular momentum , and the cross section can be scaled in energy by taking into account the centrifugal correction . estimating the centrifugal potential at the coulomb turning point @xmath56 , the effective energy may be expressed as @xcite @xmath57",
    "therefore , one expects that the function @xmath58 evaluated at an angle @xmath29 will correspond to the quasi - elastic test function ( [ qeltest ] ) at the effective energy given by eq .",

    "this last point not only improves the efficiency of the experiment , but also allows the use of a cyclotron accelerator where the relatively small energy steps required for barrier distribution experiments can not be obtained from the machine itself @xcite . moreover , these advantages all point to greater ease of measurement with low - intensity exotic beams , which will be discussed in the next section .",

    "evidently , the scaling does work well , both at energies below and above the coulomb barrier , although it becomes less good as the scattering angle decreases @xcite .",
    "low - energy radioactive beams have become increasingly available in recent years , and heavy - ion fusion reactions involving neutron - rich nuclei have been performed for a few systems @xcite .",
    "new generation facilities have been under construction at several laboratories , and many more reaction measurements with exotic beams at low energies will be performed in the near future . although it would still be difficult to perform high - precision measurements of fusion cross sections with radioactive beams , the measurement of the quasi - elastic barrier distribution , which can be obtained much more easily than the fusion counterpart as we discussed in the previous section , may be feasible .",
    "since the quasi - elastic barrier distribution contains similar information as the fusion barrier distribution , the quasi - elastic measurements at backward angles may open up a novel way to probe the structure of exotic neutron - rich nuclei .",

    "4 shows the excitation function of the quasi - elastic scattering ( upper panel ) and the quasi - elastic barrier distribution ( lower panel ) for this system .",
    "the solid and dashed lines are results of coupled - channels calculations where @xmath63 mg is assumed to be a rotational or a vibrational nucleus , respectively .",
    "we include the quadrupole excitations in @xmath63 mg up to the second member ( that is , the first 4@xmath64 state in the rotational band for the rotational coupling , or the double phonon state for the vibrational coupling ) .",
    "in addition , we include the single octupole phonon excitation at 2.615 mev in @xmath62pb .",
    "we use a version of the computer code ccfull @xcite in order to integrate the coupled - channels equations .",
    "one clearly sees well separated peaks in the quasi - elastic barrier distribution both for the rotational and for the vibrational couplings .",
    "moreover , the two lines are considerably different at energies around and above the coulomb barrier , although the two results are rather similar below the barrier .",
    "we can thus expect that the quasi - elastic barrier distribution can indeed be utilized to discriminate between the rotational and the vibrational nature of the quadrupole collectivity in @xmath63 mg , although these results might be somewhat perturbed by other effects which are not considered in the present calculations , such as double octupole - phonon excitations in the target , transfer processes or hexadecapole deformations .",
    "we mention that the distorted - wave born approximation ( dwba ) yields identical results for both rotational and vibrational couplings ( to first order ) . in order to discriminate whether the transitions are vibration - like or rotation - like , at least second - step processes ( reorientation and/or couplings to higher members ) are necessary .",
    "the coupling effect plays a more important role in low - energy reactions than at high and intermediate energies .",
    "therefore , we expect that quasi - elastic scattering around the coulomb barrier will provide a useful means to allow the detailed study of the structure of neutron - rich nuclei in the near future ."
