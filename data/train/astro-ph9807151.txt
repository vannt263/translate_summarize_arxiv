    "in recent years a number of authors have investigated the microlensing of extended stellar sources .",
    "( hereafter snw95 ) have shown that the light curves of extended sources can exhibit a significant chromatic dependence , essentially because limb darkening renders the effective radius of the star a function of wavelength .",
    "thus , in addition to improving constraints on the lens parameters , modelling the microlensing of extended sources provides a powerful tool for gravitational imaging stellar surfaces .    in this contribution",
    "we describe how microlensing light curves of extended sources may be used as a test of stellar atmosphere models .",
    "we generate artificial light curves , assuming a particular model atmosphere , and use the backus - gilbert numerical inversion method to estimate the radial stellar intensity profile from the observed light curves .",
    "the ( time dependent ) integrated flux , @xmath0 , from an extended stellar source of radius , @xmath1 , lensed by a point lens is given by ( c.f .",
    "snw95 ) @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the projected distance from the lens to the element of the stellar surface and the amplification function , @xmath4 , takes its usual analytic form for a point source .",
    "( note that @xmath3 is a function of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "if we assume that the projected stellar surface displays circular symmetry ",
    "i.e. @xmath8  we may write the above equation in the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 and the kernel function , @xmath11 , is obtained by integrating over @xmath6 .",
    "a solution to this integral equation for @xmath12 can be obtained by applying the backus - gilbert inversion procedure .",
    "this method takes account of the smoothing effect of the kernel function and reconstructs a regularised estimator of @xmath12 which optimises the trade - off between the bias and variance of the estimator . for details of the method",
    "in order to test the feasibility of reconstructing stellar surface profiles , we assumed a simple , linear , limb darkening law with coefficient , @xmath13 .",
    "we generated microlensed light curves of typically 100 data points , with an even sampling rate , and gaussian noise added to the photometry at a level of typically 2% of the baseline flux .",
    "in most cases we took the impact parameter and the einstein radius equal to the stellar radius .",
    "we considered two model atmospheres :    @xmath14 ; @xmath15 ; @xmath16 , @xmath17    @xmath18 ; @xmath19 ; @xmath20 , @xmath21    where the johnson @xmath22 and @xmath23 band linear limb darkening coefficients are from .",
    "we carried out inversions of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 band intensity profiles for these models , and investigated the effect of changing the impact parameter , stellar radius , light curve sampling rate and photometric accuracy .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] illustrates the reconstructed @xmath23 band profile for model ( 2 ) , for the case of the impact parameter and stellar radius equal to the einstein radius of the lens .",
    "the errors on the recovered solution are determined from the covariance matrix of the backus - gilbert estimator .",
    "we can see that the reconstructed profile is significantly biased for @xmath24 , due to the smoothing effect of the kernel function , but the true profile is well recovered over the interval @xmath25 .",
    "we now briefly summarise the results of varying the stellar and lens parameters .",
    "* the inversions generally recover the true profiles well over the interval @xmath25 , for a wide range of @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath13 . *",
    "increasing the einstein radius improves significantly the inversions for @xmath28 , but no improvement is seen for @xmath24 . * reducing the impact parameter ( i.e. a transit event ) significantly improves the accuracy of the reconstruction for @xmath28 and reduces the bias for @xmath24 . for impact parameters greater than the stellar radius , however , the reconstruction deteriorates rapidly for all @xmath29 . *",
    "even with photometric errors of 10% a reasonable recovery of @xmath12 is still obtained over the interval @xmath25 ; on the other hand , reducing the errors to only 0.2% does _ not _ improve the recovery for @xmath24 , however .",
    "this is because the bias is primarily due to the ill - posedness of the kernel over this range , and not due to the photometric errors . *",
    "the reconstructions become unacceptably noisy when the number of light curve data points is reduced to @xmath30 , but there is little further improvement in accuracy above @xmath31 .",
    "our results indicate that  with realistic light curve sampling and photometric errors  one can accurately reconstruct , at least in part , the multicolour radial intensity profiles of extended stellar sources from their microlensed light curves , provided that the impact parameter of the lens is comparable to the stellar radius .",
    "the smoothing properties of the kernel function result in a biased solution for @xmath24 , unless the lensing event is a transit with small impact parameter .",
    "nevertheless , the accurate recovery over the interval @xmath25 is a robust result over a wide range of stellar temperatures and limb darkening coefficients . despite the narrow width of this ` good fit ' annulus , it is still adequate to usefully discriminate between different model atmospheres ",
    "e.g. two models with the same temperature but with @xmath15 and @xmath32 .",
    "thus , we conclude that broad band microlensed photometric light curves are a powerful tool for investigating extended stellar sources and testing model stellar atmospheres , and form a useful adjoint to spectroscopic and polarimetric microlensing signatures .",
    "we are currently investigating the application of inversion techniques to more realistic model atmospheres and stellar intensity profiles ."
