    "surface plasma waves ( spw ) are collective oscillations supported by bounded media , which propagate along an interface of two media with different signs of the real part of dielectric response function .",
    "what distinguishes them from volume plasma waves ( which can propagate in both unbounded and bounded media ) is that their field is localized near the interface along which they propagate .",
    "they also have different spectral and attenuation properties than volume plasma waves  @xcite .",
    "surface plasma waves have been studied extensively since their theoretical prediction  @xcite and experimental detection  @xcite in 1950s and 1960s .",
    "there has been a significant advance in theoretical and experimental investigations of surface plasma waves in various bounded plasma structures , both in the field of plasma science [ see refs  @xcite and references therein ] and in the fields of condensed matter and surface science [ see , e.g. , a review  @xcite ] .",
    "currently , there is a renewed interest in surface plasma waves due to their ability to concentrate light in subwavelength structures , enabling to create spw - based circuits that can couple photonics and electronics at nanoscale .",
    "this offers a route to faster and smaller devices , and opens up possibilities to new technologies employing surface plasma waves  @xcite .",
    "these developments require a solid understanding of spw properties in bounded metallic and semiconductor structures .",
    "the properties of surface plasma waves are defined , among other things , by the dielectric properties of the medium that sustains them .",
    "the latter are often ( e.g. , in metals , for which the electrons are strongly degenerate ) significantly affected by the quantum nature of the charge carriers  @xcite .",
    "this can affect the properties of spw in a non - trivial way , via modification of analytic properties of the medium response .",
    "in particular , quantum effects ( due to pauli blocking and overlapping wave functions of free charge carriers in the medium  @xcite ) , when significant , can modify the dispersion , damping  @xcite and spatial attenuation of spw  @xcite supported by a bounded medium .",
    "recently , the properties of surface plasma waves in a semi - bounded degenerate plasma have been analyzed using quantum hydrodynamical approach  @xcite , and a soon after  with a more rigorous kinetic approach  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the effects of quantum recoil and quantum degeneracy of plasma electrons on spw properties have beeen analyzed .    in this paper , we show another important consequence of quantum degeneracy of electrons on spw properties , exemplified by a simple case of spw in a semi - bounded collisionless plasma with degenerate electrons .",
    "namely , we show that such system supports _ two _ types of spw , with different frequencies and qualitatively different temporal attenuation , in contrast to a case of non - degenerate semi - bounded plasma that only supports one ( `` conventional '' ) type of spw  @xcite .",
    "the new type of surface oscillations predicted here is shown to become dominant over the `` conventional '' surface oscillations at large times , and should therefore become observable , e.g. , by analyzing a spectrum of the reflected light in experimental setups for excitation of surface plasmons in thin metal films by an incident light using otto or kretschmann configurations  @xcite . at large wavelengths ,",
    "the frequency difference between these two types of surface oscillations approaches a third of the metal s plasma frequency , and thus the absorption lines in the reflected light spectrum , corresponding to excitation of surface waves of these two types , should be clearly separated and detectable .",
    "we consider a semi - bounded , nonrelativistic collisionless plasma with degenerate mobile electrons ( @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the electron temperature in energy units , @xmath2 is the electron fermi energy ) , and immobile ions ; the equilibrium number densities of electrons and ions are equal , @xmath3 ( quasineutrality ) .",
    "the plasma is assumed to be confined to a region @xmath4 , with mirror reflection of plasma particles at the boundary @xmath5 separating the plasma from a vacuum at @xmath6 .",
    "we will look at spws in the non - retarded limit , when their phase velocity is small compared with the speed of light . in this limit ,",
    "the spw field is purely electrostatic , hence we can restrain ourselves to considering only electrostatic oscillations in the considered system . following the discussion of ref .",

    "we thus see that our system supports two distinct types of surface oscillations , with different frequencies and temporal attenuation : ( i ) exponentially damped surface oscillations ( [ eq : rho(t)_poles ] ) with frequency @xmath126 , due to the poles of @xmath58  @xcite ; and ( ii ) power - law attenuated surface oscillations ( [ eq : rho(t)_cuts_kx!=0 ] ) , ( [ eq : rho(t)_cuts_kx=0 ] ) , and ( [ eq : rho(t)_cuts_kx = kxc ] ) with frequency @xmath127 , due to the branch cuts of @xmath58 . since the power - law attenuation is slower than the exponential attenuation , these oscillations should become dominant at large times , and should become observable in principle , e.g. , by analyzing a spectrum of the reflected light in experimental setups for excitation of surface waves in thin metal films by an incident light using otto or kretschmann configurations  @xcite . at small values of @xmath128 ,",
    "the frequency difference between these two types of surface oscillations approaches a third of the metal s plasma frequency , @xmath129 , and thus the absorption lines in the reflected light spectrum , corresponding to excitation of surface waves of these two types , should be clearly separated and detectable .",
    "it is interesting to note that , as seen from ( [ eq : rho(t)_cuts_kx!=0 ] ) , ( [ eq : rho(t)_cuts_kx=0 ] ) , and ( [ eq : rho(t)_cuts_kx = kxc ] ) , different @xmath105 components in the wave packet , making up the field of the surface oscillation of this type , are attenuated at different rates . since @xmath130 decays slower than @xmath131 or @xmath132 , the small-@xmath105 part of the wave packet becomes dominant over the large-@xmath105 part at large times .",
    "this corresponds to penetration of the charge perturbation away from the surface and deeper into plasma .",
    "we should stress that the reported prediction of the new type of surface waves due to the contribution of cuts of @xmath52 is a result of rigorous solution of the initial value problem , and would not have been possible to make by just seeking for solutions of the vlasov equation ( [ eq : vlasov ] ) in the form @xmath133 ( in fact , the latter would be conceptually wrong , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the presented analysis relies on several assumptions discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , of which perhaps the most critical ones are the neglect of the quantum recoil ( which does not play a significant role unless the wavelengths are extremely short ) , and the assumptions of collisionless plasma and of the sharp perfectly reflecting boundary confining the plasma . relaxing",
    "the first two assumption should not change the results qualitatively  @xcite , and there should still be two types of the surface waves when the quantum recoil is retained in the model .",
    "indeed , with quantum recoil retained , the function @xmath66 will still have the branch cuts in the lower semi - plane of complex @xmath36 , whose contribution would still lead to the second type of surface oscillations reported here . yet relaxing the assumption of",
    "the sharp plasma boundary may affect the results obtained here in a non - trivial way .",
    "firstly , the smooth boundary leads to a new resonant damping of surface oscillations , significantly increasing the exponential damping rate @xmath134 in ( [ eq : rho(t)_poles ] )  @xcite . secondly , allowing for boundary smoothness ( with a simultaneous account for the quantum tunneling , as they both have the same spatial scales )",
    "should change the analytic properties of @xmath58 in the lower semiplane @xmath81 of complex @xmath36 plane , and thus may change its branch cuts and their contribution into ( [ eq : inv_laplace ] ) .",
    "the generalization of this study to the case of non - sharp plasma boundary is however beyond the scope of this paper and is left for future work .",
    "we have studied the temporal evolution of initial perturbation of a semi - bounded degenerate quantum plasma with a sharp boundary , in the electrostatic limit . by rigorously solving the initial value problem for the set of coupled vlasov - poisson equations describing the system kinetics , we have found that the part of electric potential corresponding to surface waves can be represented , at large times , as a sum of two terms , one corresponding to `` conventional '' surface wave , the other corresponding to a new type of surface waves .",
    "this new surface wave has a larger frequency than the `` conventional '' surface wave ( in fact , its frequency corresponds to the frequency of a volume plasmon with the same wavelength , @xmath117 ) , and a slower temporal attenuation ( power - law attenuation versus the exponential damping of the `` conventional '' wave ) , making it dominant at large times .",
    "these two types of surface waves should in principle be detectable as separate waves in sensitive enough experiments on exciting surface waves in a metal film by an incident light beam ( using otto or kretschmann configurations ) . the new type of surface waves predicted here may prove to be important for designing future plasmonic devices and technologies employing interaction of light with collective surface modes .",
