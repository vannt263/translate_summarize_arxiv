    "optical implementations of quantum information technologies based on the spatial degree of freedom of single photons have at their disposal several approaches to embody a qubit or qudit structure into this continuous variable .",
    "for instance , one can encode the qubit in the spatial parity of the photon s one - dimensional transverse modes @xcite or one can truncate ( via filtering ) the infinite - dimensional discrete hilbert space of laguerre - gaussian @xcite or hermite - gaussian @xcite modes in which the photon s two - dimensional transverse distribution may be expanded . in simpler approaches , however , the qubits and qudits can be encoded either in the discretized transverse position ",
    "momentum of the photons @xcite or their angular - position ",
    "orbital - angular - momentum variables @xcite . here",
    ", we consider this former type of spatial encoding where the discretization of the one - dimensional transverse modes is achieved by making the photons pass through an aperture with @xmath0 slits [ e.g. , see fig .",
    "[ fig : qudit_transform](a ) for @xmath1 @xcite",
    ". hereafter we will refer to them as spatial qubits and qudits .",
    "recently , considerable effort has been directed toward finding methods to measure spatial qubits and qudits .",
    "this is a fundamental issue for any possible application since the extraction of information from a quantum system requires the performance of a measurement . in this respect ,",
    "@xcite have shown that the spatial filtering in transverse positions at the near and far field of a double slit corresponds to projections in the poles and equator of the bloch sphere [ fig .  [",
    "fig : qudit_transform](b ) ] , respectively .",
    "this enabled characterization of the entanglement @xcite and quantum tomography @xcite of two - photon spatial qubits .",
    "later , taguchi _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite went a step further and showed that any vector over the bloch sphere can be measured by moving a `` pointlike '' detector in a transverse position between the near field and the far field of the double slit , both achieved with the help of a lens system [ fig .",
    "[ fig : qudit_transform](a ) ] . despite successfully accessing the whole bloch sphere ,",
    "this method is difficult and time consuming in practice since it requires moving the detection system for each measurement .",
    "also , the detection efficiency decreases when the detector moves away from the diffraction envelope peak(s ) , which demands artificial compensation in the count rates when a pair of basis vectors is measured in asymmetric positions around the optical axis .",
    "a different approach for measuring only the _ equatorial _ states of spatial qubits and qudits has been recently developed by one of us and co - workers @xcite .",
    "there , phase shifts were imprinted in each slit of the array ( by a spatial light modulator ) and after this the photon was detected in a fixed transverse position in the focal plane of a lens , corresponding to an equally weighted superposition of the `` which - slit '' states without any relative phase .",
    "this enabled the postselection of noncanonical mutually unbiased basis ( mub ) and the realization of the so - called mub tomography @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we generalize on this latter scheme and propose a measurement strategy which can , probabilistically , reproduce the statistics of _ any _ observables , not only those with equatorial eigenvectors .",
    "the strategy is as follows : first , we implement a two - outcome positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) , which , with a given success probability , transforms the spatial qubit state into a convenient form .",
    "then , the successfully transformed qubit is detected in a fixed transverse position . by recording and normalizing the count rates for two such measurements , corresponding to two orthogonal projectors of @xcite",
    ", we can reproduce the statistics of the observable .",
    "thus , the method presented here requires neither moving the detection system nor compensation in the count rates and can be implemented with the current technology of multipixel liquid - crystal displays .",
    "in addition , it can be straightforwardly extended to higher dimensions and may be a valuable tool in optical implementations of quantum information protocols with spatial qubits and qudits .",
    "assume that a source produces a monochromatic single - photon field with an arbitrary spatial shape .",
    "if the photon is made to pass through a double slit [ as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qudit_transform](a ) ] , its quantum state right after it will be given by a @xmath2 density matrix , @xmath3 , which can be pure or mixed depending on the coherence properties of the source and the relevant dimensions of the double slit @xcite .",
    "typically , @xmath3 is written in the basis @xmath4 , which represents the slit where the photon was transmitted , so that @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "taguchi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that when the photon propagates through a lens system and is detected by varying the transverse position ( @xmath9 ) of a pointlike detector between its focal plane ( far field ) and image plane ( near field ) , one can access the whole bloch sphere surface of the spatial qubit [ fig .

    "this quantity does not give , directly , information about observable quantities for the spatial qubits . in order to measure observables here",

    "( [ spa_projec ] ) are orthogonal , and are thereby the eigenstates of the observable .",

    "in addition , when a pair of basis vectors is measured in asymmetric positions around the optical axis , the detection efficiency between them is different due to the diffraction envelope .",
    "one must then compensate for this by using the theoretically expected ratios between the corresponding values of the diffraction envelope at those positions .",
    "the measurements of observables whose eigenvectors lie in the great circle connecting @xmath27 and @xmath28 [ red ( vertical ) circle in fig .",
    "[ fig : qudit_transform](b ) ] are the _ only _ ones which do not require compensation .",
    "here we present an alternative strategy for measuring observables for spatial qubits , which is divided into two steps .",
    "the first step of our strategy is the implementation of a two - outcome povm whose goal is to transform , probabilistically , the initial state of the spatial qubit into a convenient form which will be discussed in the second step .",
    "the physical implementation of a povm requires the extension of the hilbert space of the system to be measured .",
    "this can be provided by an ancillary quantum system , or _",
    "ancilla _ @xcite . here",
    ", the ancilla for the spatial qubit will be the photon polarization .",
    "therefore , the hilbert space of this larger system is @xmath41 , where @xmath42(@xmath43 ) is the hilbert space of the spatial ( polarization ) qubit . assuming that the systems are initially independent , we start by preparing the ancilla in a known state , say with horizontal polarization @xmath44",
    ". then , we let them evolve subjected to a controlled interaction given by a unitary operator @xmath45 acting on @xmath41 .",
    "this interaction entangles the spatial and polarization degrees of freedom and , after it , we measure the ancilla in the basis @xmath46 ( where @xmath47 denotes vertical polarization ) .",
    "the povm will then emerge as the residual effect on the spatial qubit due to the entanglement created by @xmath45 .",
    "finally , we evaluate the postmeasurement state of the spatial qubit and the probability for each of the two possible outcomes .",
    "let @xmath48 be the elements of the povm just described , where the subscript @xmath49 labels the two possible outcomes .",
    "mathematically , they can be written as @xmath50 one can easily check that all properties of a povm are satisfied : hermiticity , @xmath51 ; positivity , @xmath52 , @xmath53 ; and completeness , @xmath54 , where @xmath55 represents the identity on @xmath42 . for our purposes",

    "it is easy to see that @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the identity on @xmath41 .",
    "this unitary operation rotates the photon polarization by @xmath61 and adds a phase shift @xmath62 , conditional to the passage of the photon through the slit @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , after @xmath45 , spatial and polarization degrees of freedom become entangled and the projective measurement @xmath64 on the ancilla polarization accomplishes the povm on the spatial qubit .",
    "if the state of the spatial qubit prior to the measurement is @xmath3 and the outcome of the measurement is @xmath65 , then the postmeasurement state of the system is @xmath66 the denominator gives the probability ( @xmath67 ) for the outcome @xmath65 , or equivalently , the probability that the state @xmath68 has been prepared .",
    "explicitly , if @xmath69 , the postmeasurement state using eqs .",
    "( [ rho_spa_qb ] ) and ( [ povm_el])([rotation ] ) , will be given by ( omitting the polarization ) @xmath70 and it is prepared with probability @xmath71    an experimentally feasible way of realizing this povm is sketched in the box shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : povm ] .",
    "first , the photon incident on the double slit is prepared with polarization @xmath44 , so that after transmission its quantum state will be @xmath72 with @xmath3 given by eq .",
    "( [ rho_spa_qb ] ) .",
    "second , a rotating half - wave plate ( hwp ) behind each slit of the double slit , followed by a phase shifter ( ps ) in one of the slits , implements the conditional unitary operation given by eqs .",
    "( [ unitary ] ) and ( [ rotation ] ) , which couples spatial and polarization degrees of freedom . finally , the polarization is measured in the basis @xmath46 with a polarizer @xcite .",
    "clearly , to build such a device in a homemade fashion is difficult in practice given the very small dimensions ( @xmath22 and @xmath21 ) of the apertures ( usually , tens of micrometers ) .",
    "however it can be easily implemented with the help of programmable liquid - crystal displays ( lcds ) .",
    "lcds are multipixel optical devices which can , in a controlled way , rotate the light polarization according to the pixel s variable phase retardance .",
    "recently , they have been used to manipulate the amplitude @xcite and phase @xcite of spatial qudits with high accuracy , which ensures the feasibility of the povm described here , even for high - dimensional qudits as we discuss later .",

    "hence , by choosing two sets ( @xmath33 ) corresponding to two orthogonal spatial projectors , we will be able to reproduce the statistics of the observable associated with these basis vectors . denoting the probability for each outcome as @xmath84",
    ", we get @xmath85 such that @xmath86 . experimentally ,",
    "this will be achieved by recording the count rate for each set @xmath83 and then normalizing the obtained data .",
    "the role of the povm @xmath87 ( [ povm_el ] ) in the context of measurement of observables is now clear .",
    "it transforms the initial state ( [ rho_spa_qb ] ) into state ( [ rho_h ] ) with the angles given by eq .",
    "( [ angles_cond ] ) , such that its new matrix elements are ( up to normalization @xmath75 ) identical to those elements in the sum of the probability ( [ prob_spa ] ) for the corresponding spatial postselection .",
    "this is done with probability @xmath75 .",
    "after that , the detection in the point @xmath74 enables the sum in the detection probability density to be independent of @xmath88 , as can be seen in eq .",
    "( [ density_p ] ) . therefore , after normalizing the count rates we obtain the relation ( [ prob_equal ] ) .",
    "although probabilistic , our method requires neither the displacement of the detection system nor compensation in the measured count rates , since the detector will always be kept fixed at the maximum of the diffraction envelope in the point @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the possibility of using programmable lcds can result in a considerable reduction in experiment time , since instead of positioning the detector for each measurement , we have only to update the predefined configuration @xmath83 in the lcd and record the counts for each measurement .",
    "the extension of this method to spatial qudits is straightforward .",
    "first , assume that in all the previous equations where a sum appears , it runs from 1 to @xmath0 .",
    "then , in the unitary transformation ( [ unitary ] ) we set the polarization rotations and phase shifters behind each slit such that @xmath89 where @xmath63 labels the slit and @xmath82 the measurement . after measuring , in the same way as before ,",
    "@xmath0 sets @xmath90 corresponding to @xmath0 orthogonal spatial projectors and normalizing the data we achieve the relation ( [ prob_equal ] ) .",
    "in summary , we have presented an alternative measurement strategy for spatial qubits which can , probabilistically , reproduce the statistics of any observable for this system . unlike spatial postselection @xcite , our method requires neither moving the detection system nor compensation in the count rates .",
    "in addition , its extension for measuring high - dimensional qudits is straightforward .",
    "the more challenging step of the strategy would comprise the realization of the povm , but , as suggested here , this could be achieved with the help of programmable multipixel liquid - crystal displays .",
    "we anticipate that this strategy can be a valuable tool in a variety of optical implementations of quantum information protocols with spatial qubits and qudits such as , for instance , remote state preparation , quantum state discrimination , and entanglement concentration .",

    ", the statistics obtained at both outputs would reproduce that of an observable . for qudits ,",
