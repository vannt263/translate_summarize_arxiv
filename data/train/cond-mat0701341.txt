    "[ specialorientations ] , width=288 ]    it is clear from this discussion that to minimize ahf - induced decoherence , cancellation conditions for all the shells with finite ahf coupling constant should be carefully avoided by properly selecting the applied magnetic field strength ( or , in electron spin resonance , the corresponding microwave cavity frequency ) .",
    "furthermore , away from the cancellation condition peaks , the e - shell nuclei ( nearest neighbors to the p nucleus ) have the strongest ahf coupling by far , so that they dominate the echo modulations by more than an order of magnitude , as seen in fig .",

    "we have verified this numerically by calculating how @xmath34 and @xmath35 vary with respect to changing the magnetic field direction about an axis that rotates from @xmath124 $ ] to @xmath125 $ ] .",
    "although we did not analyze full two - dimensional changes in direction , we do extract a characteristic scale of @xmath126 for both @xmath127 and @xmath128 of the e - shell nuclei , which we expect to be general .",
    "in addition to @xmath51 , we must also consider how an error in the magnetic field direction away from @xmath129 $ ] or @xmath125 $ ] affects @xmath71 for those nuclei which are not expected , ideally , to contribute . for such nuclei ,",
    "@xmath130 we find that @xmath131 .",
    "thus , with a one degree error in the magnetic field direction and a field strength of @xmath106 , the sites that are not supposed to contribute to eseem when the field is oriented along @xmath124 $ ] or @xmath125 $ ] could , if occupied by a @xmath11si nucleus , actually provide modulations up to about @xmath132 .",
    "this , however , scales quadratically with the angle error , so an error of @xmath132 of a degree would keep these errors below the @xmath133 threshold often quoted for quantum error correction .",
    "we have studied si : p donor electron spin decoherence due to ahf interaction , which is an important dephasing mechanism in si .",
    "we clarify the electron spin echo envelope modulation in the si : p system and the resonance - like contributions from nuclear spins in various shells away from the p atoms .",
    "our theory is in excellent quantitative agreement with experiment .",
    "most importantly , we suggest an approach to minimize the decoherence effect of ahf interaction by avoiding the cancellation conditions and orienting an applied magnetic field along directions that can periodically eliminate the contributions from the dominant e - shell nuclei .",
    "we quantitatively analyze the sensitivity of this strategy to errors in timing and magnetic field orientation .    in principle",
    ", one can eliminate the problem of nuclear spin decoherence through isotopic purification , removing the @xmath11si .",
    "after purification , those donors that still have @xmath11si nuclei in the e - shell may be disqualified as qubits .",
    "our strategy provides an alternative solution to this problem that provides the quantum computer architect with more flexibility .",
