    "the ground - state baryon octet as well as the vector - meson octet played a vital role in shaping our understanding of the symmetries of the strong interactions ( for an overview , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . according to coleman s theorem @xcite , the multiplet structure of the light hadrons is related to an approximate su(3 ) symmetry of the ground state of qcd .",
    "in fact , in the limit of massless up , down , and strange quarks , the qcd lagrangian exhibits a chiral @xmath0 symmetry , which is assumed to be dynamically broken down to @xmath1 in the ground state . as a result of this mechanism one expects the appearance of eight massless goldstone bosons @xcite , which are identified with the members of the pseudoscalar meson octet .",
    "the masses of the pseudoscalars in the real world are attributed to an explicit chiral symmetry breaking due to the finite quark masses .",
    "the masses of hadrons other than the goldstone bosons stay finite in the chiral limit .",
    "symmetry considerations not only affect the spectrum of qcd but also put constraints on the interaction among hadrons .",
    "the dynamics of hadrons may be described in terms of an effective field theory @xcite . to that end ,",
    "one considers the most general lagrangian compatible with the symmetries of the underlying theory . given a power - counting scheme",
    ", one may then calculate observables in terms of perturbation theory or , alternatively , by applying non - perturbative methods such as solving integral equations . while the interaction of the pseudoscalar octet @xmath2 with the baryon octet is largely constrained by spontaneous symmetry breaking ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , this is not the case for the coupling of the vector - meson octet to the baryon octet .",
    "moreover , when describing the dynamics of vector mesons in a lagrangian framework , one inevitably faces the following challenge .",
    "effective lagrangians for vector particles ( spin @xmath3 , parity @xmath4 ) are constructed with lorentz four - vector fields @xmath5 or anti - symmetric tensor fields @xmath6 with four and six independent fields , respectively ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "therefore , one imposes constraints which , for an interacting theory , may lead to relations among the coupling constants of the lagrangian .",
    "for example , by applying a dirac constraint analysis @xcite to the interaction of the pion triplet with the delta quadruplet , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the number of independent coupling constants reduces from three at the lagrangian level to a single coupling .",
    "additional constraints beyond the consistency at the classical level may be obtained if we require the theory to be perturbatively renormalizable in the sense of effective field theory @xcite .",
    "an investigation of this type for the pure vector - meson sector results in a massive yang - mills theory @xcite . _ all _ case studies found a reduction in the number of parameters which seemed to be independent from the point of view of constructing the most general lagrangian .",
    "this is of particular importance when working with purely phenomenological lagrangians , because one is likely to introduce more structures , and thus seemingly free parameters , than allowed by a self - consistent treatment .    in the present article ,",
    "we want to focus on the lowest - order effective lagrangian for the interaction of the vector - meson octet with the ground - state baryon octet . for that purpose , in sec .",

    "a common procedure for the quantization of a classical system with given symmetries is to first construct the lagrangian of the system , which is assumed to be invariant under the corresponding transformation of the dynamical variables , and then to perform the transition to the hamiltonian in terms of a legendre transformation . on the one hand ,",
    "the lagrangian formalism is suitable for satisfying lorentz invariance and other symmetries , on the other hand , the hamiltonian formalism is needed to calculate the @xmath7 matrix @xcite . for a system including constraints , we perform the transition from the lagrangian to the hamiltonian by applying dirac s constraint analysis to be discussed below @xcite . the quantization of the constrained system is performed using path - integral methods @xcite .    in the following , we will summarize dirac s constraint analysis in terms of a classical system with a finite number @xmath8 of degrees of freedom ( dof ) . to start with",

    "we assume that @xmath14 does not explicitly depend on time and that the @xmath15 appear in monomials of maximal degree 2 in @xmath14 : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath18 is a symmetric @xmath19 matrix , @xmath20 . to perform the transition to the hamilton formalism , one needs to introduce the momenta @xmath21 conjugate to the coordinates @xmath10 , @xmath22 or @xmath23 because the hamiltonian is a function of @xmath24 , one needs to be able to invert eq .",
    "( [ pi ] ) to go over from the set of dynamical variables @xmath25 to @xmath24 . to uniquely solve eq .",

    "however , in the case that the determinant vanishes , the theory is singular and one can not pass from the lagrange function to the hamiltonian formulation in the standard manner . in this case , we make use of a method originally proposed by dirac @xcite .    in a singular system , we are not able to determine all velocities as functions of the coordinates and the independent momenta .",
    "let the unsolvable @xmath31 be the first @xmath32 velocities @xmath33 .",
    "the so - called _ primary _ constraints occur as follows .",

    "using @xmath38 we consider the so - called _ total _ or _ extended _ hamilton function @xcite @xmath39 where the @xmath40 , @xmath41 , are lagrange multipliers taking care of the primary constraints and the @xmath42 are the solutions to eq .",

    "the time evolution of the primary constraints @xmath44 is given by the poisson bracket with the total hamilton function , leading to the consistency conditions @xmath47 the `` weak '' equality sign refers to the fact that the conditions hold only after the evaluation of poisson brackets .",
    "either all the @xmath40 can be determined from these equations , or new constraints arise .",
    "the number of these secondary constraints corresponds to the number of @xmath48 s ( or linear combinations thereof ) which could not be determined .",
    "again one demands the conservation in time of these ( new ) constraints and tries to solve the remaining @xmath48 s from these equations , etc .",
    "the number of physical degrees of freedom is given by the initial number of degrees of freedom ( coordinates plus momenta ) minus the number of constraints . in order for a theory to be consistent",
    ", the chain of new constraints has to terminate such that at the end of the procedure the correct number of degrees of freedom has been generated . using this consistency condition",

    "( [ lagrangian ] ) .",
    "the ellipses stand for an infinite string of `` nonrenormalizable '' higher - order interactions as well as for interactions with other hadrons .",
    "we make the assumption that the `` nonrenormalizable '' interactions are suppressed by powers of some large scale and concentrate , at the present time , on the leading - order lagrangians @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 given by    @xmath59    we have taken these lagrangians to be invariant under the infinitesimal _ global _",
