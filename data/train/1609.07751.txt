    "the study of hadronic properties at finite temperature @xmath2 is one of the theoretical ingredients needed to understand the behaviour of matter created in relativistic heavy ion collision experiments , such as those in rhic and lhc ( alice ) . in particular , the qcd transition involving chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement plays a crucial role , as it is clear from the many recent advances of lattice groups in the study of the phase diagram and other thermodynamical properties @xcite . for vanishing baryon chemical potential ,",
    "the qcd transition is a crossover for 2 + 1 flavours with physical quark masses , the transition temperature being about @xmath5 150 - 160 mev , determined by the vanishing behaviour of the quark condensate and the peak of the scalar susceptibility . in the chiral limit",
    "it becomes a second - order phase transition consistent with the @xmath6-model universality class @xcite , which is supported in lattice simulations by the mass and temperature scaling of thermodynamical quantities as well as chiral partner degeneration @xcite .",
    "the expected reduction in the transition temperature from the physical mass case to the chiral limit one based on those analysis is about 15 - 20@xmath7 @xcite .    from the theoretical side , it is therefore important to provide solid analysis of this chiral restoration pattern based on effective theories , given the limitations of perturbative qcd at those temperature scales .",
    "such effective description should start from a proper understanding of the lightest component , i.e. the pion gas .",
    "pions are actually the most abundant particles after a heavy ion collision and most of their properties from hadronization to thermal freeze - out can be reasonably described within the temperature range where effective theories are applicable .",
    "in fact , approaches based on effective theories for the lightest mesons provide a good description of the physics involved , especially in what concerns the effect of the lightest resonances , as we discuss below .",
    "a more accurate treatment of thermodynamic quantities near @xmath8 would require including heavier degrees of freedom , which can be efficiently achieved through the hadron resonance gas framework @xcite .    a systematic and model - independent framework that takes into account the relevant light meson degrees of freedom and their interactions is chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite .",
    "the effective chpt lagrangian is constructed as a derivative and mass expansion @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes generically a meson energy scale compared to the chiral scale @xmath11 1 gev .",
    "the lowest order lagrangian @xmath12 is the non - linear sigma model ( nlsm ) .",
    "thus , chiral restoring behaviour is qualitatively obtained within chpt through the vanishing quark condensate for different orders @xcite , although a critical description is not obtained in the chiral limit . despite the model - independent character of the chpt predictions for chiral restoration , the low-@xmath2 nature of this theory implies a continuous behaviour for order parameters and susceptibilities , even in the chiral limit .",
    "thus , the quark condensate is a dropping continuous function around the critical point and the scalar susceptibility grows also continuously .",
    "in addition , chpt is unable to describe resonant states , which play a crucial role in the description of the hadronic medium .",
    "some of these limitations are improved within the unitarized framework at finite temperature @xcite , which provides an accurate description of several effects of interest in a heavy - ion environment , such as thermal resonances and transport coefficients @xcite .",
    "it provides also a novel understanding of the role of the @xmath13 @xmath14 thermal pole ( a broad resonant state ) in chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "thus , the scalar susceptibility saturated with this @xmath15-like state within the so - called inverse amplitude method ( iam ) unitarization , develops a maximum near @xmath8 @xcite compatible with lattice data and chiral partners in the scalar - pseudoscalar sector are understood through degeneration of correlators and susceptibilities .",
    "the role of the @xmath4 state for chiral restoration could become more complicated if its possible tetraquark component is also considered at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "a complementary approach is the large-@xmath1 one , where @xmath1 is the number of light nambu - goldstone bosons ( ngb ) . within this framework , the lowest order chiral effective lagrangian for low - energy qcd will be the @xmath0 nlsm , whose corresponding symmetry breaking pattern is @xmath16 .",
    "as we have just commented , the latter is believed to take place in chiral symmetry restoration for @xmath17 , since @xmath6 and @xmath18 are respectively isomorphic to the isospin groups @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in this limit ,",
    "many of the features discussed above arise naturally . for instance , the pion scattering amplitude generates the @xmath4 resonance in accordance with scattering and pole data .",
    "when extended at finite temperature , thermal unitarity holds exactly and the thermal pole gives rise to a saturated scalar susceptibility diverging in the chiral limit at the critical temperature as a second - order phase transition @xcite . within a similar context , it is worth mentioning also recent large-@xmath1 analysis in the vector @xmath21 model regarding the @xmath15 spectral properties at finite @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the large-@xmath1 framework for the nlsm has been analyzed in earlier works under various approximations . at @xmath22 , functional methods were developed in @xcite ; the scattering amplitude , including its renormalizability , was studied in the chiral limit in @xcite and to leading order in mass corrections in @xcite . at finite temperature , apart from the previously mentioned work @xcite , the free energy and the quark condensate within a saddle - point approximation for the auxiliary field were analyzed in @xcite .",
    "other studies in the chiral limit that also utilize functional methods @xcite provide a chiral restoring analysis and the @xmath2-dependence of the pion decay constant @xcite .",
    "a later work @xcite studied the nlsm as the infinite coupling limit of the @xmath21 vector model , their results for the nlo pressure in the chiral limit not being fully consistent with those in @xcite .",
    "various renormalization - group studies of the critical properties of this model were compiled in @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will analyze the leading large-@xmath1 contributions to the quark condensate and the scalar susceptibility , derived diagrammatically from the partition function or the free energy .",
    "since we are mostly interested in the study of the critical behaviour , we will restrict to the leading order in the chiral limit , which has the additional advantage of yielding results that are not to be renormalized . the scalar susceptibility and the analysis of the critical behaviour are new from this work .",
    "in addition , another motivation for the present study and a prominent difference with respect to previous analysis is that we will work directly within the diagrammatic approach to the partition function , identifying the dominant contributions to the free energy .",
    "thus , that approach will not introduce additional assumptions within the auxiliary field method , such as saddle point approximations , but will require a careful evaluation of the diagrams and effective vertices involved .",
    "in fact , for the susceptibility analysis we will deal with a resummation of an infinite set of closed ring diagrams , which will confirm qualitatively the analysis performed previously in terms of pion scattering and the thermal @xmath4 saturation .",
    "that comparison is also another motivation for the present work . we will need to calculate the large-@xmath1 free energy up to order @xmath23 in order to extract properly the leading order susceptibility near the chiral limit , which actually means going beyond previous analysis of the nlsm for large @xmath1 . in this sense , our present study aims to set up the correct diagrammatic framework for future analysis beyond the chiral limit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we will present our main formalism in section [ sec : form ] , the detailed diagrammatic analysis will be performed in section [ sec : diag ] and the results will be presented in section [ sec : res ] , where we compare the obtained critical behaviour with previous theoretical approaches , as well as with lattice results for critical exponents .",

    "the light quark condensate behaves as an order parameter for chiral symmetry restoration in the chiral limit :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the light quark mass , @xmath43 with @xmath44 the number of light flavours and we have used the standard relation between the ngb mass and the quark mass @xmath45 , related also to the @xmath22 quark condensate in the chiral limit @xmath46 .",
    "the quark condensate correlator defines the scalar susceptibility , namely :    @xmath47}. \\label{chil4q}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    an important comment is that throughout this work , we will be interested only in the chiral limit @xmath48 , which , as explained above , should capture the essential features of the chiral phase transition , both for the quark condensate and for the scalar susceptibility .",
    "however , from their previous definitions and , we see that it is necessary to keep @xmath27 finite and send it to zero only after differentiation .",
    "thus , we will consider the large-@xmath1 leading contribution for finite mass and then we will keep only the relevant terms in the @xmath27 expansion near the chiral limit .",
    "this is a distinctive feature with respect to previous large-@xmath1 nlsm analysis at finite @xmath2 , which analyze @xmath49 within the limit of massless pions , but not its @xmath27 corrections @xcite , particularly relevant for the case of @xmath50 , since , from its divergent nature near the transition it is indeed expected to behave as an @xmath51 quantity @xcite , which we will also obtain in this approach by keeping the relevant @xmath23 terms .    in the following analysis",
    ", the free energy density will be expressed in terms of different thermal functions .",

    "thus , defining @xmath57 as the tadpole function with @xmath58 the free pion propagator , we have :    @xmath59 , \\label{g1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath60 the matsubara frequencies , @xmath61 the renormalization chpt scale and @xmath62 the euler gamma function .",
    "we follow the same notation as in @xcite .",

    "in order to identify the leading order contribution in the large-@xmath1 limit for fixed mass @xmath27 , it is useful to examine the different possible terms for a given number of vertices , i.e. , to a certain order in the expansion of the interaction part of the lagrangian ( [ nlsm ] ) in the free energy .",
    "thus , we first extract the constant term @xmath67 which is @xmath68 and we will denote by @xmath69 the leading contribution for @xmath70 vertices at large @xmath1 for fixed @xmath27 . the contribution with zero vertices",
    "is that coming from the free kinetic pion part of the nlsm lagrangian ; this corresponds to the free partition function of a @xmath1-component massive boson gas :    @xmath71 , \\label{z0}\\ ] ]    which is also @xmath68 .",
    "the contributions @xmath72 and @xmath73 are given by diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) in figure [ fig : parfun ] , respectively .",
    "we also keep the space - time dimension @xmath74 in the dimensional regularization scheme .",
    "the free energy is divergent and needs renormalization , as it is discussed in detail within the chpt expansion in @xcite .",
    "renormalization within the large-@xmath1 framework can also be carried out by including suitable higher order lagrangians in derivatives and masses .",
    "this is reviewed for the scattering amplitude at @xmath22 in @xcite and for @xmath75 in @xcite . at the order considered in this work , as we will see , the dominant contribution is finite",
    ", so we will not need to implement explicitly such renormalization procedure .",
    "and up to @xmath3 .",
    "the black squares denote the effective vertex depicted in figure [ fig : massvertex ] .",
    "the dashed lines in ( e ) indicate multiple insertions of this vertex along the central loop . ]",
    "the one - vertex contribution corresponds to the first order in the expansion of the interaction lagrangian in ( [ nlsm ] ) . in the mass term ,",
    "i.e. , the one with the @xmath76 function , we get the maximal contribution in @xmath1 by contracting all pion pairs with the same isospin indices , so that @xmath77 with @xmath78 in .",
    "therefore , we have to sum all tadpole insertions in the vertex as given by the function @xmath76 in the lagrangian , which we attain by defining an effective vertex as indicated in figure [ fig : massvertex ] . on the other hand",
    ", one realizes that contractions involving the interaction derivative term in the lagrangian ( the term proportional to the function @xmath79 in ) give always subdominant contributions in @xmath1 since @xmath80 by parity , so those contributions are @xmath81 in the large-@xmath1 expansion of the free energy .",
    "we point out that the combinatoric factors shown in figure [ fig : massvertex ] remain the same as those obtained from the @xmath82 expansion of the mass vertex in ( [ nlsm ] ) .",
    "this is because our analysis , albeit diagrammatical , is not describing any specific scattering process as in previous analysis @xcite but closed diagrams for the free energy , so we do not have to consider extra factors in the resummation given by the function @xmath83 .",
    "another significative difference with the scattering case is that here derivative vertices do not show up to leading order .",

    ". corresponds to @xmath86 in @xcite . ] the above contribution @xmath87 corresponds to the connected diagram ( c ) in figure [ fig : parfun ] .",
    "the topology of this diagram is the same as in chpt @xcite but here effective mass vertices enter and derivative vertices are absent .    for two vertices , following the above considerations , the dominant contribution in @xmath1 , which is again @xmath68 , is obtained by taking the two vertices as the two mass effective vertices of figure [ fig : massvertex ] .",
    "the corresponding connected diagram is shown in figure [ fig : parfun ] ( d ) .",
    "thus , those effective vertices count as @xmath82 each , the external bubbles connected to the vertex also count as @xmath1 , and the internal bubble connecting the two vertices counts an additional @xmath88 coming from @xmath89 .",
    "any other combination is subleading , including the derivative vertices in ( [ nlsm ] ) . hence , even if the @xmath90 contractions in @xmath31 are taken maximally in @xmath1 , since @xmath91 can not be contracted at the same point one ends for diagram ( d ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : parfun ] with the structure @xmath92 for one mass vertex and one derivative vertex and @xmath93 for two derivative vertex , instead of the @xmath94 structure of the two mass vertices .",
    "following the same arguments , other topologies of diagrams considered in the chpt expansion @xcite are subdominant for large @xmath1 at finite mass , like diagram ( a ) in figure [ fig : otherdiagrams ] .",

    "thus , at each vertex there will be an additional @xmath97 factor , where @xmath98 is the integer labelling the power @xmath99 at vertex @xmath100 .",
    "hence , we end up with a modified effective vertex function for that diagram , namely :    @xmath101=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-x}}-1 . \\label{modeffvert}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in addition , we have to multiply by 2 from the two ways to contract @xmath102 and by @xmath103 from the lagrangian expansion , so that the leading @xmath68 term for @xmath96 is :    @xmath104 ^ 2 g_2(m , t ) + { { \\cal o}}(n^0)= -\\frac{nm^3t}{32\\pi}\\left[\\tilde g\\left(\\frac{t^2}{12f^2}\\right)\\right]^2 + { { \\cal o}}(m^4\\log m , n^0 ) \\label{z2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath105 in and using the expansions and around the massless limit .",
    "now , for three or more vertices @xmath70 , following the previous arguments , the dominant connected diagrams are those with only effective mass vertices and @xmath106 bubbles .",
    "those bubbles can be either closed around one of the vertices or connecting a subset of them , so that two given vertices are connected at most with two lines .",
    "examples of these general @xmath68 foam or super - daisy type diagrams @xcite are diagram ( e ) in figure [ fig : parfun ] and diagrams ( b ) and ( c ) in figure [ fig : otherdiagrams ] .",
    "however , a crucial point of our present approach is that only a subclass of those foam diagrams is dominant to leading order in the @xmath27 expansion , namely the ring or daisy diagrams of the type depicted in figure [ fig : parfun ] . to understand this , note first that any of those generic diagrams contains a product of the type @xmath107 , multiplied by the corresponding effective vertices ( which are functions of @xmath78 only ) , with @xmath108 the number of loops and @xmath109 given in .",
    "hence , we see that the minimum power of @xmath95 in a foam diagram is obtained when setting @xmath110 to its maximum allowed value , which is @xmath111 and hence @xmath112 , which corresponds to the loop function @xmath113 connecting those @xmath70 single bubbles , and the other @xmath114 .",
    "including also the effective vertices described above , that combination corresponds to the ring diagrams depicted in figure [ fig : parfun](e ) , whose @xmath27 counting is then @xmath115 times a function of @xmath116 , near the chiral limit .",
    "other foam diagrams are subleading , like diagram ( b ) in figure [ fig : otherdiagrams ] which is proportional to @xmath117 and so on for other diagrams like diagram ( c ) in figure [ fig : otherdiagrams ] .",
    "we recall that the dominance of ring diagrams near the infrared region is a known feature of thermal field theory @xcite and allows us precisely to extract the @xmath3 term needed to calculate the leading order of the scalar susceptibility .",
    "in addition , and as announced above , to this leading order all the results are finite , since the @xmath22 corrections are subleading . therefore , at this level of approximation we will not need to discuss the renormalization details of the calculation in terms of the infinite set of coupling constants arising from higher order lagrangians @xcite . within that standard large-@xmath1 approach , we can consider then that those low - energy constants of higher order are subleading .",
    "we will just keep in mind that they may introduce subleading corrections to our expressions , which for instance could modify numerically the transition temperature , as we discuss below .",
    "the energy density up to @xmath3 in the large-@xmath1 limit is obtained then by summing all ring diagrams , taking into account that we have to multiply by : i ) @xmath118^n$ ] from the modified effective vertices , which count all the ways to take in each effective vertex the two pion lines shared with the adjacent vertices , ii ) by @xmath119 for the two possible ways to take those shared lines in every link , iii ) by @xmath120 from the series expansion of the interaction lagrangian , iv ) by @xmath121 , which are the topologically different ways of sorting @xmath70 points in a circle , and v ) by @xmath122 from the loops .",
    "finally we obtain :    @xmath123-\\frac{mt}{4\\pi f^2}h ' \\left[\\frac{t^2}{12f^2}\\right]\\right\\ }   \\nonumber\\\\   & - & \\frac{nm^3t}{8\\pi}h\\left[-\\frac{1}{2 } \\tilde g\\left(\\frac{t^2}{12f^2}\\right)\\ \\right ]    + { { \\cal o}}\\left[m^4\\log m , n^0\\right ] , \\label{zorderm3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath124 . the combinatoric factor given here resembles that obtained for a finite - temperature effective higgs potential in @xcite .",
    "we remark that the result is meaningful only as a expansion around the chiral limit @xmath48 so we can extract the leading order for the quark condensate and the scalar susceptibility in that limit .",
    "although the mass expansion performed here could yield mass corrections to the free energy , quark condensate and scalar susceptibility , we must be careful at this point .",
    "the @xmath95 expansion that we have carried out here comes from two different dimensionless parameters , namely @xmath54 and @xmath125 .",
    "thus , while we expect the behaviour of thermal functions to be dominated by the chiral limit contribution in the high temperature regime @xmath126 , @xmath125 is a pure @xmath22 parameter coming from the mass vertex in the lagrangian . therefore , mass corrections might not be reliable for physical masses .",
    "a related complication introduced by the large-@xmath1 resummation is that , as showed above , from @xmath96 onwards the effective vertex is actually @xmath127 , with @xmath128 given in , which may introduce spurious divergences near @xmath129 when keeping a finite mass @xmath95 . for these reasons",
    ", we will stick here to the strict chiral limit @xmath48 since it ensures that those two dimensionless scales can be treated as perturbatively equivalent .",
    "thus , we will keep only the @xmath130 term in for the condensate and the @xmath131 term for the scalar susceptibility . in this work",
    "we are interested in the critical behaviour of the large-@xmath1 expansion and , therefore , it makes sense to restrict to the chiral limit as a first approximation to the problem . a proper treatment of finite mass effects within the large-@xmath1 expansion would require in principle to sum all types of foam diagrams like that in figure [ fig : otherdiagrams ] ( c ) .",
    "from the analysis of the previous section , we can easily extract the quark condensate in the chiral and large-@xmath1 limits , from and :    @xmath132    where we denote by @xmath133 the temperature at which the quark condensate vanishes , and @xmath134 .",
    "the result is certainly expected from the chiral limit analysis in @xcite , where the same temperature dependence is found for the scaling of the effective sigma field @xmath135 .",
    "although the identification @xmath136 is very natural from the viewpoint of the quark model assignment , note that within our present approach we do not need to introduce any such @xmath15 field , since we have the exact leading mass dependence of the free energy .",
    "the above result is also numerically compatible with the condensate obtained from the large-@xmath1 framework in @xcite , which relies on a saddle point approximation developed via the auxiliary field method and depends on a cutoff parameter .",
    "therefore , the quark condensate at this level of approximation vanishes at @xmath129 and , more importantly , is not defined above @xmath129 , unlike the chpt expression which is just a polynomial whose leading order is recovered just by expanding in powers of @xmath137 , namely @xmath138 ; this corresponds to the leading order chpt result in the chiral limit for @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "note also that , consistently with previous studies @xcite @xmath129 is independent of @xmath1 to leading order . as for the particular value of the transition temperature @xmath129 , taking the standard value for the pion decay constant in the chiral limit @xmath139 87.1 mev yields @xmath140 174.24 mev , which is high compared to the restoration temperature in the chiral limit expected from lattice data .",
    "however , the present approach is not meant to provide a @xmath129 close to such lattice values , mostly because is based only on ngb degrees of freedom .",
    "heavier states in the partition function would contribute significantly to reduce the condensate and @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "in addition , higher order lagrangians could modify the @xmath22 value of the condensate and hence the critical temperature .",
    "what is more meaningful is to compare the result with the standard chpt analysis to different orders in the chiral limit @xcite , as we show in figure [ fig : cond ] .",
    "the value of @xmath129 is reduced with respect to the nnlo chpt while kept within the expected uncertainty given by a @xmath82 expansion near @xmath17 .",
    "actually , from the chiral expansion of we get already a factor of @xmath141 reduction in @xmath129 with respect to leading order chpt .     in the chiral limit compared to the chpt results for different orders as obtained in @xcite ]",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the main improvement of the large-@xmath1 analysis with respect to the chpt one is that the system undergoes a second - order phase transition , as corresponds to qcd in the chiral limit , which is clear from the analytic expression and from figure [ fig : cond ] .",
    "the system does not undergo a first - order phase transition since there are not jump discontinuities in the order parameter ; the latter behaviour is seen for instance when considering auxiliar field methods to analyze finite - temperature effects in an @xmath6 nonlinear model @xcite .",
    "this second - order critical behaviour will be confirmed by our analysis of the scalar susceptibility below .    despite the fact that we can not access from this approach the region @xmath142 , let us analyze further the analytic behaviour of the condensate below @xmath129 . at this point",
    "it is important to recall the critical behaviour observed in lattice qcd . in @xcite , the scaling with the quark mass and the temperature of lattice data",
    "is fitted reasonably well to the three - dimensional @xmath143 and @xmath6 universality classes ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "thus , the quark condensate is expected to scale in the chiral limit @xmath144 as the second - order behaviour @xmath145 for @xmath146 , where the value of the critical exponent @xmath147 is given in table [ tab : critexp ] for the cases considered in @xcite .",
    "our value is then @xmath148 from , which is not far from the lattice observations , still within the @xmath82 expected error , although giving a stronger critical behaviour .",
    "note that , as commented above , we are including only goldstone bosons and not heavier states and hence we must consider our framework as a qualitative description of the transition , which actually captures its main critical features and certainly improves over standard low-@xmath2 expansions such as chpt . in fact , the critical behaviour is meant to be controlled by goldstone bosons below the transition @xcite .",

    "after taking into account the mass expansions of all the functions involved we find the following remarkably simple expression :    @xmath149    expression diverges below @xmath129 as a second - order phase transition , as qcd in the chiral limit and confirming our previous analysis of the condensate .",
    "actually , the critical behaviour with @xmath2 and @xmath95 for @xmath143 and @xmath6 3d models is given by @xmath150 for @xmath151 and @xmath48 , where the values of the critical exponent @xmath152 are given in table [ tab : critexp ] .",
    "therefore , we reproduce the expected mass behaviour for @xmath50 and we obtain a critical exponent slightly above but not far from those models , which reproduce fairly well the critical behaviour of lattice qcd @xcite . as explained above , this is more than reasonable for a description based only on the lightest ngb which again lies within the expected numerical uncertainty while capturing the main features of the chiral transition .",
    "note also that , consistently , from we recover the leading order chpt expression for the thermal part of the susceptibility in the chiral limit @xcite as @xmath153 .",
    "the @xmath22 vanishes at this order and is included in the @xmath154 neglected corrections in .",
    "finally , we also compare our results with the analysis performed in @xcite and @xcite , from which one can define a scalar susceptibility saturated by the thermal @xmath4 state , with a mass corresponding to that scalar resonance defined as @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is the position of the pole in the second riemann sheet of the scattering partial wave with isospin and angular momentum @xmath14 calculated also at finite temperature within the large-@xmath1 limit in @xcite and with the iam in @xcite around the chiral limit . in order",
    "that such saturated susceptibility complies properly with the expected low-@xmath2 behaviour given by the lo chpt in the chiral limit , we define it as    @xmath157    neglecting the @xmath22 logarithmic contribution near @xmath158 , and we plot @xmath159 for different approaches , which is then @xmath1-independent .",
    "the results are showed in figure [ fig : suscep ] , where we also include the chpt chiral limit one for comparison , which to leading order is just a constant with the normalization chosen .",
    "higher order chpt corrections yield smoothly growing functions of @xmath2 . in the saturated large-@xmath1 case",
    ", we have used the parameters of the so called grayer fit in @xcite .",
    "saturated one defined through , considered in @xcite at large @xmath1 , where the results with grayer fit have been considered .",
    "we also include the saturated susceptibility with the iam @xcite in the chiral limit and the chpt lo chiral limit result for comparison .",
    "temperatures are rescaled to the critical temperature for each case , namely @xmath160 mev for the present approach , @xmath161 mev for the saturated large-@xmath1 one , @xmath162 mev for the saturated iam and @xmath163 mev for the chpt chiral limit one . ]",
    "first of all , we observe that the values of the critical temperature differ considerably between the free - energy analysis , like the one we present here or chpt , and those based on thermal @xmath4 saturation ( either iam or large-@xmath1 ) .",
    "as we have commented above , the numerical value of @xmath129 obtained from the present approach is presumably affected by higher order terms and does not account for any physical state other than the ngb ones .",
    "in contrast , the saturation approach incorporates successfully the thermal @xmath4 , relying on a good description of the physical @xmath22 pole consistent with scattering data and the quoted pdg values for that state .",
    "in fact , the critical temperature of that approach is closer to the expected values from lattice analysis , which highlights the importance of that thermal state .",
    "nevertheless , the most important result here has to do with the critical behaviour , so that in order to provide a clearer comparison of the two approaches in that sense , we have represented the susceptibility in terms of @xmath164 , where @xmath129 is different for each method .",
    "as it can be seen from figure [ fig : suscep ] , although the critical exponent for the saturated @xmath165 are larger ( the numerical results are given also in table [ tab : critexp ] in table [ tab : critexp ] differ from those quoted in @xcite by small numerical corrections which come from taking more points close to the transition temperature in the present work . ] ) , they depart later from the low-@xmath2 chpt value , so in the end the two approaches remain very close near the critical region .",
    "this is an important check of consistency between those two different ways to determine @xmath50 , concerning its critical behaviour .",
    "in this work we have analyzed the quark condensate and the scalar susceptibility of a gas of @xmath1 goldstone bosons to leading order in @xmath1 in the chiral limit . to obtain the leading behavior of the susceptibility",
    "requires to compute up to @xmath23 corrections in the free energy ( which come from an infinite set of closed ring diagrams ) . to this order ,",
    "the results are directly finite and then , it is no necessary to add higher order lagrangian counterterms within the usual large-@xmath1 framework .",
    "this diagrammatic treatment in terms of thermal effective vertices and dominant diagrams would allow to extend this analysis beyond the chiral limit or for higher orders in the @xmath82 expansion .",
    "our results show a critical behaviour in reasonable agreement with the universality classes expected for lattice simulations of the chiral transition , both for the quark condensate and for the scalar susceptibility , within the numerical uncertainties expected for a large-@xmath1 approach .",
    "this is particularly realized in the critical exponents for those quantities .",
    "the quark condensate improves over nnlo chpt in the sense that it reduces the value of its vanishing point and , more importantly , it behaves as the order parameter of a second - order transition , the critical @xmath129 being @xmath1-independent to leading order .",
    "the differences in the critical temperature with respect to chpt remain within the expected @xmath82 uncertainty .",
    "likewise , the scalar susceptibility that we have calculated here diverges at the same @xmath129 as the condensate vanishing , as it should .",
    "in fact , another motivation of the present work was to test the consistency of a recent approach based on saturating the scalar susceptibility with the thermal @xmath4 resonance pole .",
    "our present analysis shows a reasonable agreement between the two methods regarding the critical behaviour in terms of @xmath164 .",
    "however , the value of @xmath129 is much lower in the saturated approaches that in those based on the partition function , like chpt or the one we present here .",
    "this is most likely due to having incorporated properly the physical @xmath4 state and its thermal dependence , which somehow mimics the influence of higher order contributions in the perturbative chiral approach .    to obtain higher order corrections in",
    "the mass expansion would require to sum additional infinite sets of diagrams , the so - called foam diagrams .",
    "this would be especially interesting for the case of the scalar susceptibility , since in principle it should lead to a change from a divergent second - order transition to a smooth peak characteristic of a crossover , as observed in lattice simulations .",
    "that analysis is beyond the scope of this work and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the present study can be useful as a first approach to this problem , setting up the diagrammatic framework for future studies while extending previous analysis in a nontrivial way and capturing the main features of chiral restoration in qcd .",
