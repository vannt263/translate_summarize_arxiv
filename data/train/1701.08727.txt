    "away from the edge , the system forms a monocrystal that spans the interior of the droplet . immediately adjacent to the droplet edge",
    ", the lattice is aligned with the edge . where the orientation of the interior region does not match that of the edge , grain boundaries form , a few lattice spacings from the boundary .",
    "these grain boundaries are delineated by a chain of polarized dislocations ( 5 - 7 pairs ) .",
    "[ fig : edgegrain ] ]    given the small number of particles in our system , the extent to which our data are well - modeled by kthny theory is quite surprising .",
    "this agreement is only possible because the orientation of the droplet edge , which is delineated by a line of pinned particles ( see fig .  [ fig : confocal_plus_trajectoires ] ) , does not propagate into the interior of the droplet . in the fluid phase",
    ", this is expected , since orientational correlations decay exponentially over lengths of a few interparticle spacings  this decay is evident in the @xmath110 curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : g6s ] ( a ) . in the crystal phase , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : edgegrain ] , the orientation inherited from the droplet edge is destroyed by a series of grain boundaries that run around the inner perimeter of the droplet .",
    "these grain boundaries separate an interior monocrystalline region from an outside layer , a few interparticle spacings wide , which is aligned with the edge of the droplet .",
    "evidently , the strain fields associated with these grain boundaries are not large enough to significantly disrupt the phase behavior of the material in the interior region . in the hexatic , it is not immediately clear how the system accommodates the presence of the droplet edge , since grain boundaries are difficult to identify unambiguously in this phase .",
    "the concurrence between our findings and previous work on larger systems of dipolar repulsive particles extends to quantitative agreement on the transition values of the interaction parameter @xmath55 @xcite , although the sparsity our data , as well as the error bars for @xmath55 shown for example in fig .",
