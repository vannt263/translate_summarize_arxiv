    "the dynamics of the lyness recurrence @xmath11 specially when @xmath12 has focused the attention of many researchers in the last years and it is now completely understood in its main features after the independent research of bastien & rogalski @xcite and zeeman @xcite , and the later work of beukers & cushman @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "in particular all possible periods of the recurrences generated by are known and for any @xmath13 infinitely many different prime periods appear .",
    "however there are still some open problems concerning the dynamics of rational points . with the computer experiments in mind , and following @xcite , it is interesting to know the existence of rational periodic sequences . the lyness map @xmath14 associated to , leaves invariant the elliptic curves and @xmath2 the curve is not elliptic .",
    "we study these values separately . ] @xmath15 and the map action can be described in terms of the group law action of them . in consequence",
    "several tools for studying the rational periodic orbits on them are available .",
    "in particular , from mazur s torsion theorem ( see for example @xcite ) , we know that , under the above hypotheses , the rational periodic points can only have ( prime ) periods @xmath16 and @xmath17 our first result proves that almost all these periods appear for the lyness recurrence for suitable @xmath18 and rational initial conditions .    [ teo ] for any @xmath19 there are @xmath20 and rational initial conditions @xmath21 such that the sequence generated by is @xmath10-periodic .",
    "moreover these values of @xmath10 are the only possible prime periods for rational initial conditions and @xmath1 .",
    "notice that the value @xmath22 is the only one in mazur s list that is not in the list given in the theorem .",
    "following @xcite it is possible to interpret that this period corresponds to the case @xmath23 see remark  [ infinity ] in section  [ totq ] .",
    "concerning the rational periodic points in @xmath24 for the lyness map with @xmath12 it is proved in @xcite that it only can have periods @xmath25 and @xmath26    taking @xmath27 and @xmath28 we obtain trivially 1-periodic integer sequences .",
    "the existence of positive rational periodic points of period 5 is well known and simple : they only exist when @xmath29 and in this case all rational initial conditions give rise to them because the recurrence is globally 5-periodic . on the other hand ,",
    "as far as we know , the case of period 9 has resisted all previous analysis . in particular , the conjecture  2 of zeeman , @xcite says that there are no such points and their existence is left in problem . ]",
    "1 bis of @xcite as an open question .",
    "we prove that there are some values of @xmath2 for which the lyness recurrences have positive rational periodic sequences of period 9 and , even more , that this happens for infinitely many values of @xmath8 see more details in theorem [ teoa ] .",
    "it is known , see again @xcite , that the periodic points of period 9 of @xmath30 are on the elliptic curve @xmath31 and they have positive coordinates only when @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the biggest root of @xmath34 see also subsection  [ grouplaw ] .    by using magma ( @xcite ) , and after several trials , we have found some positive rational points on the above curve proving that the zeeman s conjecture  2 has a negative answer .",
    "the simplest one that we have obtained is @xmath35 .",
    "notice that the sequence  , taking @xmath36 and the initial condition @xmath37 , @xmath38 gives @xmath39 other positive rational points that we have found are @xmath40 and many others with much bigger entries .",
    "our main result proves that there are infinitely many positive rational values of the parameter @xmath2 giving rise to @xmath7periodic positive rational orbits .",
    "[ teoa ] there are infinitely many values @xmath41 for which there exist initial conditions @xmath42 such that the sequence given by the lyness recurrence is @xmath7periodic . furthermore , the closure of these values of @xmath2 contains the real interval @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the biggest root of @xmath45    notice that there is a small gap between the values @xmath46 and @xmath47 where we do not know if there are or not rational values of @xmath2 for which the lyness recurrence has positive rational periodic orbits of period 9 . as we will see in the proof of the theorem the gap",
    "is provoked by our approach and it seems to us that it is not intrinsic to the problem , see the comments in section  [ periode9 ] , after the proof of the theorem .    from the classical results of mordell , see for example ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch.viii ) , it is well known that the set of rational points on an elliptic curve @xmath48 over @xmath49 together with the point at infinity , form an additive group @xmath50 and @xmath51 where @xmath52 is called the rank of @xmath50 and @xmath53 is the torsion of the group .",
    "notice that @xmath54 is a measure of the amount of rational points that the curve contains .",
    "the torsion part @xmath53 is well understood from the results of mazur already quoted , and it contains at most 16 points . for the elliptic curve it is easy to check that @xmath55 fixed any @xmath56 among all the allowed possibilities , it is not known if the rank of the elliptic curves having @xmath57 for some @xmath52 , has an upper bound , but it is believed that it has not ( see the related conjecture viii.10.1 in @xcite ) . as far as we know , nowadays when @xmath58 the highest known rank is greater or equal than  28 while when @xmath59 the highest known rank is  4 , see @xcite .",
    "we have found values of @xmath2 for which the algebraic curve   has ranks @xmath60 or @xmath61 .",
    "for instance @xmath62 appears for @xmath63 and the value 4 happens for @xmath64 a key point to obtain these results is the following theorem , which extends the results of @xcite , given for the cases of torsion points with order 5 or 6 , and proves the universality of the level curves invariant for the lyness map .",

    "this means that for any elliptic curve @xmath48 over any field @xmath72 ( not of characteristic 2 or 3 ) with a point @xmath73 of order @xmath10 , there exist unique values @xmath74 and a unique isomorphism between @xmath48 and @xmath75 sending the zero point of @xmath48 to @xmath76 and the point @xmath77 to @xmath78 .",
    "moreover , given a finite @xmath10 , the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath79 can be easily obtained from the computations made in subsection  [ grouplaw ] .    from a dynamical viewpoint",
    "the above result implies that the lyness map is an affine model for most birrational maps on elliptic curves .",
    "this result is similar to the one described by jogia , roberts and vivaldy in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3 ) , where they use the weierstrass normal form .",
    "moreover , notice that in our result the sum operation takes the extremely easy form @xmath80)=[xy : az^2+yz : xz]$ ] ( see section [ grouplaw ] ) .",
    "once for some value @xmath18 a periodic orbit in @xmath81 of period @xmath7 for @xmath30 is obtained , it is not difficult to obtain infinitely many different 9-periodic orbits by using the group law on the curve .",
    "for instance , for a given @xmath8 we know that if a point @xmath82 is on then @xmath83 is also on it .",
    "in particular for @xmath36 if we write @xmath84 we get @xmath85 and @xmath86 can be obtained for instance by plugging @xmath87 in and choosing a suitable solution  @xmath88 taking @xmath89 we find @xmath90 which also gives rise to a 9-periodic orbit in @xmath81 .",
    "taking now @xmath91 as starting point for the procedure we obtain a new initial condition for a 9-periodic orbit : @xmath92 and so on .",
    "in general we have the following result , see subsection  [ grouplaw ] .    [ propob ]",
    "if @xmath41 is a value for which there exist an initial condition @xmath93 such that the sequence   is @xmath7periodic , then there exist infinite many different rational initial conditions giving rise to @xmath7periodic sequences .",
    "moreover the points corresponding to these initial conditions fill densely the elliptic curve ( [ 9p ] ) .    observe that such a point @xmath93 always gives rise to a point on the elliptic curve given by which is not a torsion point , because all the @xmath7-torsion points are not in @xmath94 see again subsection  [ grouplaw ] .",
    "the case of 5-periodic points is studied in section  [ periode5 ] , proving that for @xmath29 there are some elliptic curves @xmath95 with rank @xmath62 and , as a consequence , ovals without points with rational coordinates .",
    "finally , last section is devoted to give rational values of @xmath2 for which the lyness map @xmath30 has as many periods as possible , of course with rational initial conditions .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following .",
    "in subsection [ grouplaw ] we recall some known results which describe the action of the lyness map in terms of a linear translation over elliptic curves .",
    "subsection  [ nf ] is devoted to prove theorem  [ nft ] about the lyness normal form . in section  [ totq ]",
    "we prove theorem  [ teo ] , while the proof our main result , theorem [ teoa ] , and all our outcomes on rational 9-periodic points of are presented in section [ periode9 ] .",
    "section  [ periode5 ] studies the number of rational points on the elliptic curves invariant for @xmath96 and the last section deals with the problem of finding a concrete @xmath30 with as many periods as possible .",
    "the results of this subsection are well known , we refer the reader to references @xcite for instance to get more details .",
    "as mentioned above , the phase space of the discrete dynamical system defined by the map is foliated by the family curves @xmath97    this family is formed by elliptic curves except for a few values of @xmath79 .",

    "hence , from the above expressions of @xmath126 we can obtain the values of @xmath79 corresponding to a given period .",
    "for instance , for period 9 we impose that @xmath127 , or equivalently @xmath128 which gives @xmath129 . from this equality",

    "let @xmath111 be a point of @xmath48 such that @xmath132 for @xmath133 is never the neutral element @xmath134 . recall that when the elliptic curve is defined over @xmath135 there are at most sixteen points @xmath111 with rational entries not satisfying this property due the mazur classification of the torsion subgroup of @xmath50 .",
    "then the adherence of the set @xmath136 is :    * either all the curve @xmath48 , when @xmath111 belongs to the connected component of @xmath48 which does not contains the neutral element @xmath137 ; or * the connected component containing @xmath137 when @xmath111 belongs to it .",
    "this result is due to the fact that there is a continuous isomorphism between @xmath138 with this operation and the group @xmath139 , with the operation @xmath140 see for instance corollary 2.3.1 of ( * ? ? ?",
    "v.2 ) . clearly , by using this construction , proposition  [ propob ] follows .",
    "notice that when an elliptic curve is given by @xmath65 the bounded component never contains  @xmath137 .",
    "it is known that any elliptic curve having a point @xmath77 that is not a 2 or a 3 torsion point can be written in the so called tate normal form @xmath141 where @xmath77 is sent to @xmath142 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "our proof will follow by showing that the curves @xmath65 can be transformed into the ones of the tate normal form .",
    "in projective coordinates these curves write as @xmath143 and the curves @xmath65 as @xmath144 with the change of variables @xmath145 and the relations @xmath146 both families of curves are equivalent and the theorem follows .",
    "observe that the case @xmath147 corresponds to a curve with a @xmath61torsion point . as we will see in the proof of theorem  [ teoa ] one advantage of this normal form",
    "is that it is symmetric with respect to @xmath148 and @xmath88    from theorem  [ nft ] we have that all the known results on elliptic curves with a point of order greater than 4 can be applied to the corresponding lyness curves .",
    "in particular we find inside @xmath149 the curves with high rank and prescribed torsion given in @xcite or we can use the list of  elliptic curve data \" for curves in cremona form ( @xcite ) , taking advantage of the magma or sage softwares that allow to identify a given elliptic curve in it .",
    "as was explained in subsection  [ grouplaw ] the curves @xmath65 are elliptic for all values of @xmath2 and @xmath79 except for @xmath150 , with @xmath151 given in ( [ hchc ] ) .",
    "on the curves corresponding to these values there could be , for the rational periodic orbits , some periods that are not in the list given by mazur s theorem . in this section",
    "we prove that no new period appears .",
    "[ genere0 ] the periods of the rational periodic orbits of @xmath30 lying on the curves @xmath65 for @xmath152 are @xmath153 and 12 .",
    "it is well known that the case @xmath154 is globally 6-periodic .",
    "so from now on we consider that @xmath155 we start the study of the rational cubic curves @xmath156 , where @xmath151 are given in ( [ hchc ] ) and moreover @xmath157 . by setting @xmath158",
    ", we have @xmath159 note that @xmath154 implies that @xmath160 ; @xmath161 implies that @xmath162 ; and @xmath163 implies that @xmath164 .",
    "observe also that since @xmath2 and @xmath165 are in @xmath135 then @xmath166    by using again a computer algebra software we obtain the following joint parametrization of both curves @xmath156 :    @xmath167 moreover @xmath168    on each curve @xmath156 the lyness map @xmath30 can be seen as @xmath169 where @xmath170 has to be determined . by using we",
    "obtain that @xmath171 is the linear fractional transformation @xmath172 where recall that @xmath166 therefore the dynamics of @xmath30 on each of the curves @xmath156 is completely determined by the dynamics of the maps @xmath170 .",
    "it is a well - known fact that if a linear fractional map , @xmath173 , has a periodic orbit of prime period @xmath174 , @xmath175 then it is is globally @xmath174-periodic .",
    "moreover this happens if and only if either :    * @xmath176 and @xmath177 and in this case @xmath178 is @xmath179-periodic ; or * @xmath180 and @xmath181 is a primitive @xmath174-root of the unity and in this case @xmath178 is @xmath174-periodic .",
    "hence , apart of the fixed points , the maps @xmath170 can have @xmath174-periodic solutions , @xmath182 , if and only if @xmath183    the condition that @xmath184 is a primitive @xmath174-root of the unity , implies that @xmath185    it is also a well - known fact that the only rational values of @xmath186 , where @xmath148 is a rational multiple of @xmath187 are @xmath62,@xmath188,@xmath189 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 6.16 ) or @xcite ) .",
    "this fact implies that @xmath190 the only allowed valued is @xmath191 , which implies that @xmath192 and so the corresponding map @xmath171 is not periodic .",
    "hence , only the fixed points of @xmath30 appear on this family of curves .    concerning the case @xmath98 ,",
    "observe that @xmath193 .",
    "when @xmath29 there are no periodic orbits on this level set . when @xmath194 the three straight lines forming this set are mapped one into the other in cyclical order by @xmath195 and so they are invariant under @xmath196 the cyclical order determined by @xmath30 is : @xmath197 the restriction of @xmath198 on @xmath199 is given by @xmath200 hence the dynamics of @xmath198 is determined by the dynamics of the linear fractional map @xmath201 one of its fixed points corresponds to the continua of three periodic points of @xmath30 given in table  1 . by using again the characterization of the periodicity of the linear fractional maps we obtain that @xmath171 is periodic only when @xmath202    it remains to study the case @xmath203 .",
    "in this situation @xmath204 and @xmath30 sends the straight line to the hyperbola and vice versa .",
    "so both level sets are invariant under @xmath205 the restriction of @xmath206 on @xmath207 is given by @xmath208 hence the dynamics of @xmath206 is determined by the linear fractional map @xmath209 which has fixed points only when @xmath210 they give rise to 2-periodic points of @xmath30 when @xmath211 and to a fixed point when @xmath212 arguing as in the case @xmath213 , the map @xmath171 is @xmath174-periodic , @xmath214 only when @xmath215 this happens if and only if @xmath216 and @xmath217 or equivalently when @xmath218 ( recall that the case @xmath154 is already considered ) .",
    "the case @xmath219 gives a @xmath61-periodic map @xmath171 and @xmath220 a @xmath221-periodic map .",
    "these cases correspond , respectively , to the existence of continua of @xmath222 and @xmath4 periodic points for @xmath30 on @xmath223 .      from lemma  [ genere0 ] we know that when @xmath152 the possible periods on @xmath65 are in the list given in the statement . for those points on the elliptic curves @xmath65 for all values of @xmath2 and @xmath224 we can apply mazur s theorem and we obtain that the only possible periods are the ones of the statement together with the period 4 .",
    "the points of ( prime ) period 4 can be discarded by observing that in subsection  [ grouplaw ] we prove that @xmath225 it is also possible to perform a direct study with resultants of the system @xmath226 . from this study",

    "so , from now one we can assume that the 12 periodic points lie on an elliptic curve @xmath65 .",
    "first of all , given @xmath228 , it is easy to obtain that there is a rational periodic point with period 1 if and only if @xmath229 is a square in @xmath135 and that there is one with period 2 if and only if @xmath230 is a square in @xmath135 . by using the expressions of @xmath126 given in section 2.1 ( or by using the known results for the tate curve @xcite ) , we get that the explicit parameterization of the values of @xmath2 and @xmath79 for which @xmath78 can have order 12 is @xmath231 for some @xmath232 . hence , to have a rational periodic points with periods 1 and 12 , we need rational numbers @xmath233 such that @xmath234 is a square in @xmath135 .",
    "we will show that this only happens for the values @xmath235 and @xmath236 , which do not give prime period 12 .",
    "multiplying by @xmath237 , we need to search for rational solutions of the equation @xmath238 .",
    "a standard change of variables , similar to the one used used in section  [ periode9 ] , shows that this genus one curve is isomorphic to the elliptic curve with corresponding number in the cremona s list equal to 15a8 , which has only four rational points .",
    "these points correspond to the points with @xmath235 and @xmath239 .    similarly , to have rational periodic points with periods 2 and 12 , we need rational numbers @xmath233 such that @xmath240 is a square in @xmath135 .",
    "arguing as in the previous case we arrive to the equation @xmath241 which number in cremona s list is 39a4 and has only the two rational points corresponding to @xmath242 .",
    "so the result follows .      in order to find 9 or 10 rational periodic points for @xmath243",
    ", one can not just naively search for points , since their coordinates are too big .",
    "so we use the following strategy .",
    "first , with the same formulas that in the proof of theorem  [ nft ] , we transform the equations @xmath244 for their corresponding @xmath245 and @xmath246 to a weierstrass equation .",
    "we need to find non - torsion points on these elliptic curves .",
    "since the weierstrass equations have too big coefficients , we apply @xmath179-descent procedure with magma in order to get an equivalent quartic equation with smaller coefficients for the corresponding elliptic curves .",
    "we get that they are equivalent respectively to @xmath247 and @xmath248 these are still not sufficient simple to be able to find ( non - torsion ) rational points , so we do another transformation . in the first case , we apply @xmath61-descent in order to obtain another form , this case as intersection of two quadrics ( in the projective space ) .",
