    "a number of codes were built in the past to compute the structure and the emission of photoionized media . with time , these codes became more and more sophisticated , and able to treat a larger number of situations . in the sixties",
    "they were specially designed for planetary nebulae and hii regions , i.e. for dilute and optically thin media ( except in the lyman continuum ) ionized by the thermal radiation of a hot star , and were rapidly used also for ionization by a non thermal continua extending in the x - ray range , i.e. for the narrow line region of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . at the same time",
    "another generation of codes was developed for optically thin hot collisionally ionized media , and used for the solar corona , for supernova remnants , and for the hot intergalactic gas . at the end of the seventies , observations of compact x - ray sources implying the presence of a thomson thick medium incited ross ( 1979 ) to develop a radiative transfer method for the continuum using a modified version of the kompaneets equation . in the same paper he introduced the",
    "so - called  escape probability \" approximation to take into account diffusion and absorption into the lines .",
    "this approximation was thereafter amply used for the broad line region : this was the beginning of the local escape probability era , with the fiducial paper of kwan & krolik ( 1981 ) aimed at studying the broad line region of agn ( blr ) , immediately followed by a similar computation for the atmospheres of x - ray binary stars ( kallman and mccray 1982 ) from which derived .",
    "the most popular of these codes is , designed by ferland ( cf .",
    "for instance ferland & rees 1988 ) and continuously updated since this time ( cf .",
    "ferland 1996 , ferland et al . 1998 ) .",
    "these codes are not only used for relatively  cold \" clouds like the blr , but also for warm photoionized media ( broad absorption line region in quasars and  warm absorbers \" in agn , shock heated media , etc ... ) .    at the other extreme ( i.e. for dense ,",
    "non irradiated , and semi - infinite media ) model atmosphere codes have been developed since the fifties with an emphasis put onto the computation of line transfer , which was treated completely , but with the lte approximation .",
    "non lte effects were introduced in the sixties , and extensively studied in the seventies , with the state of the art being beautifully exposed in mihalas book ( 1978 ) . since this time many improvments have been made in the numerical methods , in particular aiming at taking into account a large number of atoms and levels , cf . for introductory reviews",
    "rutten 1995 , hubeny 1997 .    in the nineties appeared the urgent need for  intermediate \" codes , valid for thick or semi - infinite dense media , eventually hot , irradiated by a non thermal continuum extending in the hard x - rays , to cover the whole range of situations encompassed in agn and in binary stars .",
    "several codes were then built , mainly to compute the em - ission spectrum of accretion disks , irradiated or not by an x - ray continuum .",
    "for irradiated disks , they were either of  photoionization type \" , using the kompaneets equation ( ross & fabian , 1993 , based on the ross 1979 code ) , or coupling an existing photoionization code to a monte carlo computation ( zycki et al .",
    "1994 ) , to take into account compton diffusions . on the other hand ,",
    "sophisticated model atmosphere codes were transformed to be applied to accretion disk structure and emission ( hubeny , 1990 , hubeny & hubeny 1997 and 1998 ) , but without the external irradiation by an x - ray continuum .",
    "owing to the high optical thickness of the medium in several frequency ranges , such codes require that the transfer of both the continuum and the lines be solved in an  exact \" way ,",
    "i.e. avoiding approximations such as local escape approximation ( for the lines ) or one stream approximation ( for the continuum ) . since the medium is generally dense and sometimes close to lte , they require that all processes and inverse processes be carefully handled . being irradiated by an x - ray continuum , the medium contains a large number of ionic species , from low to high ionization , which should all be introduced in the computation .",
    "finally , the medium being hot and thick , not only thomson , but also compton scattering , should be taken into account .",
    "we have undertaken to build a code in order to satisfy these requirements .",
    "precisely we have built several interconnected codes , which allow more flexibility .",
    "the ensemble is far from being perfect and still contains several approximations which restrict its use , but we intend to improve it in the future .",
    "we have presently four codes .",
    "one of them ( ) is designed to study the structure of a warm or hot thick photoionized gas , and to compute its emission - reflection - transmission spectrum from the infrared up to about 20 kev .",
    "it solves the energy balance , the ionization and the statistical equilibria , the transfer equations , in a plane - parallel geometry , for the lines and continuum .",
    "then , given the thermal and ionization stratification , the computation of the emitted spectrum from 1 kev to a few hundre - ds kev is performed with which uses a monte - carlo method taking into account direct and inverse compton scattering ( it allows also to study various geometries ) . adresses the case of more diluted and thin media , and is similar to with however some differences , and is specially devoted to the computation of the line fluxes , including very weak lines , using the most recent available atomic data and a full treatment of the statistical equilibrium equations for a great number of levels .",
    "these codes can be used to model a wide variety of astrophysical media , particularly those in which the energy transport is purely radiative , but also plasmas heated by other mechanisms ( viscosity , shocks , energetic particules ... ) .",
    "they have already been used in several published papers ( collin - souffrin et al .",
    "1996 , czerny & dumont 1998 , porquet et al .",
    "1998 , abrassart 1999 ) .",
    "the three codes , and , are described in other papers ( abrassart 2000 , dumont & porquet 2000 ) . in this paper",
    "we present and we discuss a few simple cases , schematized by a slab of gas irradiated on one side or on both sides . as far as possible we will perf - orm comparisons with in the range of parameters where both codes can be used , to assess the validity of .",
    "however detailed comparisons are not possible , as they use quite different transfer methods in particular .",

    "owing to the representation of the ions made in the code it does not give an accurate determination of the weak lines .",
    "for a detailed determination of the line spectrum of some ions , it should be complemented by .",
    "we briefly summarize below the physical processes ( sect .",

    "3 ) , the thermal equilibrium , ( sect .",
    "4 ) , focussing only on the aspects which are not treated in a standard way . the coupling of and",
    "is briefly described in sect . 5 , and some applications are presented in sect .",
    "in the physical state of the gas ( temperature , ion abundances and level populations of all ionic species ) is computed at each depth , assuming stationary state , i.e. local balance between ionizations and recombinations of ions , excitations and deexcitations , local energy balance ( equality of heating due to absorption and cooling due to local emission ) , and finally total energy balance ( equality between inward and outward fluxes ) .    due to the large range of density and temperature inside the medium , many physical processes",
    "play a role at some place and should therefore be taken into account .",
    "ionization equilibrium equations include radiative ionizations by continuum and line photons , collisional ionizations and recombinations , radiative and dielectronic recombinations , charge transfer by h and he atoms , the auger effects , and ionizations by high energy electrons arising from ionizations by x - ray photons .",
    "energy balance equations include free - free , free - bound and line cooling , and compton heating / cooling .",
    "the emission - absorption mechanisms for the continuum include free - free and free - bound processes , two - photon process , and thomson scattering .",
    "special care is given to recombinations to ground state , which are very important from an observational point of view in the x - ray range .",
    "they are treated differently according to the relative values of @xmath4 to the photon energy bin , in order to get an accurate frequency dependence .",
    "hydrogen and hydrogen - like ions are treated as 6-level atoms .",
    "levels 2s and 2p are treated separately , while full l - mixing is assumed for higher levels .",
    "all processes including collisional and radiative ionizations and recombinations are taken into account for each level ( cf .",
    "mihalas 1978 ) .",
    "recombinations onto levels @xmath5 are not taken into account , which amounts to assuming that the higher levels are in lte with the continuum , which is generally true in the conditions for which this code is presently used . in the future we plane to add several other levels , and to sum the contributions of the higher levels as it is done for instance in .",
    "level populations are then obtained as usual by matrix inversion .    in order to save computation time ,",
    "non h - like ions are presently treated with a rough approximation : interlocking between excited levels is neglected and populations of the excited levels are computed separately using a two - level approximation .",
    "this approximation does not predict correctly the details of the line spectrum , since it neglects subordinate lines .",
    "nevertheless recombinations onto excited states are taken into account in the ionization equilibrium and the transfer of these photons is treated in an approximative way as proposed by canfield & ricchiazzi ( 1980 ) .",
    "we assume also that each recombination produces a resonant photon after cascades .",

    "inverse processes ( except dielectronic recombinations ) are computed through the equations of detailed balance . in the case of a gas close to lte",
    ", we neglect dielectronic recombinations for consistency to insure the balance for each process .",
    "all induced processes are taken into account .",
    "the equations are not recalled as they have been given in previously quoted papers .",

    "though the iron k lines constitute a complex system described in band d.l .",
    "et al . ( 1990 ) , we assume presently only one  mean \" line per ion with an oscillator strength equal to 0.4 , as suggested by band .",
    "more detailed computations are not required as far as the doppler broadening of the lines ( or compton broadening as well , see abrassart 2000 ) is much larger than the distance between the lines , as it is the case in agn .    in other computations of the line",

    "an important quantity will be used all along this paper , the illumination ( or  ionization \" ) parameter . among several definitions used in the literature ,",
    "we adopt the following :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the frequency integrated flux incident on one side of the slab and @xmath21 is the hydrogen number density at this surface . note that it does not preclude the possibility of having also a flux incident on the back side of the slab .",
    "we call the attention on the fact that all along this paper we will * mimic * a semi - isotropic and not a mono - directional illumination .",
    "we want to study , on one hand media with an optical thickness larger than unity in a range of frequency rich in emission or in absorption lines , on the other hand media with a very inhomogeneous structure .",
    "for instance if the illuminated side has a temperature of a few 10@xmath22 k , while the temperature is only a few 10@xmath1 k on the back side of the cloud , the spectrum emitted by the illuminated side is mainly formed in hot layers where the absorption coefficient is weak at all wavelengths and thomson diffusion is dominant ( we shall call it the *  reflected spectrum \" though it does not correspond to pure reflection * ) . on the contrary the spectrum emitted by the backside of the slab is formed in cold layers where",
    "absorption must be carefully taken into account ( we shall call it the  outward spectrum \" ) .",
    "note also that , even if the incident illumination is mono - directional , the  transmitted spectrum \" is almost isotropic since the thomson thickness , @xmath23 , is larger than unity .",
    "it is therefore not differentiated from the  outward spectrum \" even when the incident source is not located on the line of sight .",
    "it is possible to estimate an approximate transmitted spectrum using the expression @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the incident flux , in an aim of comparison .",
    "the transfer is treated with the eddington two - stream approximation , i.e. the intensity is assumed to be constant in each hemisphere .",
    "the transfer equations can then be written :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the distance to the illuminated edge , @xmath28 is the absorption coefficient , @xmath29 is the diffusion coefficient - here it is due to thomson scattering - and @xmath30 is the emissivity ( all these quantities are local and depend on the frequency @xmath31 except @xmath29 ) .",
    "note that this approximation is closer to the semi - isotropic case than to the normal case .",
    "we have already mentioned that it is appropriate for the reflected and for the transmitted flux when the thomson thickness is larger than unity .",
    "it is also appropriate for a semi - isotropic illumination , if the source of radiation is extended ( like for instance in the disk - corona model of agn , or in the blob model of collin - souffrin et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the mean intensity @xmath32 is equal to @xmath33 , while the flux f defined as usual by @xmath34 is equal to @xmath35 ; so that the reflected flux is equal to @xmath36 , and the outward flux to @xmath37 .",
    "the optical depth and the total optical depth are defined as :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the total thickness of the slab , and the source function as :    @xmath40    both sides of the slab can be illuminated by an external radiation , so the boundary conditions are , at @xmath41 :    @xmath42    and at @xmath43 :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the back - side flux ( it is equal to zero in many of the following computations ) .",
    "the formal solution of the transfer equations between @xmath46 and @xmath27 gives :    @xmath47    assuming that @xmath48 is nearly constant in the interval @xmath49 , one gets :    @xmath50   \\label{eq - trans6}\\ ] ]    with a similar equation for @xmath51 .",
    "guessing the initial value of @xmath52 fails because calculations diverge , unless this initial value is provided with an extreme precision : the predicted value should differ from the real one at all frequencies by less than @xmath53 .",
    "this problem has also been pointed out by coleman ( 1993 ) .",

    "we divide the sl - ab into a set of plane - parallel layers with the density @xmath21 given in each layer .",
    "note that the code can easily be coupled with a prescription for the density or for the pressure , such as a constant pressure , or a pressure given by hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "presently the slab is divided in about 300 layers .",
    "the geometrical thickness of each layer is sm - aller close to the surfaces than in the middle of the slab because of the rapid variation of the physical paramet - ers ( the optical thickness , the temperature , the ionization state ) .    - for each layer , starting from the illuminated side , where @xmath59 is given by eq .",

    "the source function , the opacity and the emissivity , are computed .",
    "as they depend on @xmath32 , we use eq .",

    "- the whole calculation is repeated until convergence .",
    "it is stopped when energy balance is achieved for the whole slab ( i.e. when the flux entering on both sides of the slab is equal to the flux coming out from both sides ) .",
    "the drawback of this method is that it requires a large number of iterations to get a complete convergence of the model .",
    "the iteration starts by assuming given values for @xmath51 .",
    "if this initialisation is not adequate , convergence problems are encountered .",
    "we have chosen for the first iteration @xmath51 equal to @xmath65 multiplied by a factor of the order of unity , which works reasonably well .",
    "actually the convergence of @xmath51 ( as well as of the temperature and the ionization state ) is reached within less than 1@xmath66 after only a relatively small number of iterations in the layers corresponding to about one thomson thickness .",
    "this property is interesting as far as the outward spectrum is negligible , which is the case in the euv and x - ray range .",
    "it can also be used to determine the ionization state and the temperature of the layers where compton diffusion takes place ( cf . sect .",

    "the model is a slab with the following characteristics :    - a constant density 10@xmath67 @xmath68 ,    - a column density 10@xmath69 @xmath3 ;    - it is illuminated on one side by an incident power law continuum proportional to @xmath70 from 0.1 ev to 100 kev ,    - the illumination parameter is @xmath71 erg cm s@xmath72 ;    - there is no illumination on the other side ;    - the abundances are ( in number ) : h : 1 , he : 0.085 , c : 3.3 10@xmath73 , n : 9.1 10@xmath74 , o : 6.6 10@xmath73 , ne : 8.3 10@xmath74 , mg : 2.6 10@xmath74 , si : 3.3 10@xmath74 , s : 1.6 10@xmath74 , fe : 3.2 10@xmath74 .    in the following",
    "we will call this our  reference model \" . all along the paper",
    "we will use the same density and the same spectral distribution of the illuminating radiation , so we will not specify these parameters anymore . note that , for this peculiar spectral distribution , @xmath75 and the ratio of incident ionizing photon number to hydrogen densities , u , are related by : @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the maximum and minimum photon frequencies .",
    "we want to stress here the importance of the backward intensity .",
    "it can not be neglected as it participates to the ionization , to the level population , and to the energy balance .",
    "for instance in a purely scattering medium the returning flux varies as @xmath79 , so when @xmath23 is much larger than unity , all the incident flux is reflected .",
    "thus the temperature of the first layer at the illuminated side ( which depends on the sum of incident plus returning radiation ) should increase with the column density for a given incident flux ( except possibly in cases of very high values of the illumination parameter ) .",
    "[ fig - gtitancloudyt - col ] shows the dependence of the surface temperature on the column density @xmath80 .",
    "the model is similar to the reference one except that the illumination parameter is equal to 100 erg cm s@xmath72 and the column density is varying .",
    "we see that the surface temperature is constant up to about @xmath81 @xmath3 , but after it increases from 2 10@xmath82 k to 2.7 10@xmath82 k for @xmath80 increasing from @xmath83 to @xmath84 @xmath3 .",
    "it saturates when a large fraction of the slab becomes close to lte , and the returning flux becomes constant . with ( version 9004 )",
    "the surface temperature does not depend on the column density ( for a correct comparison the illumination parameter in must be multiplied by a factor @xmath85 to account for the semi - isotropic approximation used in ) .",
    "[ fig - gt - fii ] displays the dependence of the surface temperature on an assigned ratio @xmath86 independent of the frequency .",
    "we see that a modest returning flux ( 20@xmath66 ) is sufficient to account for the 60@xmath66 increase of the surface temperature reached for @xmath87 @xmath3 , with respect to a very small column density . to understand this behaviour",
    ", one should remember that the spectral distribution of the reflected flux contains a much larger proportion of euv radiation than the incident continuum , in particular in the lines .",
    "so the illumination parameter is increased by a larger amount than the ratio of the integrated reflected over incident continuum .",
    "we can also guess that the increase of the temperature at the illuminated surface with respect to will be compensated by a decrease at the back side , because of energy conservation ( cf .",
    "[ fig - gtemptitclouc22 - 24 ] ) .",
    "radiative transfer of the lines is treated in the same way as the continuum , the line profile being represented by several frequencies distributed symmetrically around the line center .",
    "we assume that even if large macroscopic velocities are present , they do not play any role in the line transfer , in other words that the thickness of the slab is much smaller than the scale length of the velocity gradient .",
    "we also assume that the lines do not overlap , which is valid as far as multiplets are treated globally , and if the microscopic turbulent velocity is not much larger than the thermal velocity ( doing this we neglect line fluorescence due to the overlap of two lines , like the heii balmer@xmath88 line and the hydrogen ly@xmath6 line , whose wavelengths differ only by a fraction 4 10@xmath73 ) .    finally we assume presently complete redistribution in all the lines .",
    "we intend to include partial redistribution for resonance lines like ly@xmath6 in the near future . for the moment",
    "partial redistribution in these lines can be mimicked by assuming complete redistribution in a pure doppler profile , as the line photons diffuse more in space than in frequency , owing to the absence of enlargment of the lower level .",
    "a doppler profile can also be used for strongly interlocked lines , and in any case , it does not differ strongly from a voigt profile when @xmath89 is smaller than @xmath90 so the medium is optically thin in the damping wings .",
    "note that partial redistribution is less important in dense media , like irradiated accretion disks in agn , than in dilute media , owing to collisional redistribution .",
    "the line profile @xmath91 is a symmetrical voigt function .",
    "the doppler width @xmath92 and the damping constant depend on the temperature and on the density , and consequently vary with @xmath27 .",
    "it may happen that the temperature decreases by two orders of magnitude from the illuminated to the back side , so @xmath92 decreases by one order of magnitude .",
    "this must be taken into account to choose the points in the profile . to solve the statistical equilibrium equations one needs to know the total line intensity weighted by the profile @xmath93 , and to treat the thermal and ionization equilibria one simply integrates the line intensity over the frequencies @xmath94 .",
    "for intense lines the first integral is dominated by the doppler core , and the second by the wings . in the case of a saturated line with strong wings , the set of frequencies chosen to describe the line must cover a range from a few tenths @xmath92 to a few hundreds @xmath92 and at least 10 points are necessary for a correct representation of the profile .",

    "we see on this figure that @xmath102 and @xmath107 are almost always identical .",
    "it is first due to the fact that the slab is very thick , so @xmath100 is much larger than @xmath108 except very close to the back side , and second because @xmath109 is always @xmath110 , as all the lines displayed on the figure are intense .",
    "but @xmath102 differs considerably from @xmath99 in the region where the lines are formed ( i.e. the region where @xmath99 is not equal to zero and where the ion is present ) .",
    "in particular @xmath99 is negative in an important fraction of the line formation region for h@xmath6 , l@xmath6 , and oviii l@xmath6 , while @xmath102 is a positive quantity .    as a consequence",
    "the line spectrum is not correctly computed when escape probabilities are used .",
    "this can be seen on table [ table-1 ] which gives the equivalent widths ( negative if the line is in absorption , positive if it is in emission ) of some intense lines from both sides of the slab .",
    "several of these lines are in absorption , either from the illuminated or from the dark side , which is impossible with the escape probability approximation .",

    "all this implies that the continuum emitted from both sides ( including for instance the lyman discontinuity ) is completely converged , and only the few non converged lines are not well computed , in particular those emitted by the back side ( but they are negligible in the whole energy balance ) . since we do not claim to compute a correct line spectrum before the subordinate lines are implemented in the code , we think that this approximation is sufficient for our present purpose .",

    "it is not always clear which approximations are used in the different codes .",
    "basically the computation of the diffuse radiation field seems to be similar in all codes , except in ross & fabian ( 1993 ) and in subsequent works using this code , where it is computed using the kompaneets equation .",
    "( ferland 1996 ) , ( kallman & krolik , 1995 for the last version ) , ( netzer 1990 , 1993 ) , use a modified version of the  on the spot \" approximation , which amounts to assuming a kind of escape probability for the diffuse continuum , and one stream approximation in the transfer equation .",
    "these approximations are correct only for a continuum optical thickness smaller than unity ( effective or total opacity ) , and when the properties of the cloud do not vary considerably between the point where a photon is emitted and the point where it is reabsorbed . in particular one very important requirement for studying hot and thick media is to take into account the radiation returning from the backside of the slab , even when it is not illuminated . as the medium is optically thick in a large frequency range ,",
    "this radiation is intense and modifies the physical state of the whole slab , including the illuminated side(see fig .",
    "[ fig - gtitancloudyt - col ] ) .",
    "all previous photoionization codes , except that of collin - souffrin and dumont ( s. ) ( 1986 ) , treat line transfer by the so - called local escape probability formalism , which uses the probability that a line photon emitted at a given point can escape * in a single flight * from the cloud , assuming that the rest of the cloud is homogeneous and has the same properties as the emitting layer .",
    "it amounts to identifying the divergence flux of the statistical equilibrium equations with the escape probability intervening in the line emerging flux .",
    "this approximation is valid only in the case of complete frequency redistribution , absence of line interlocking , and * if the medium is homogeneous*. its use can have severe consequences on the emission line spectrum and on the energy balance when these conditions are not fulfilled as it was often discussed , see for example by collin & s.dumont ( 1986 ) or elitzur ( 1984 ) .",
    "we introduce here the divergence flux in the aim to show that our results are completely different from those obtained by the escape probability formalism .        where @xmath91 and @xmath153 are the absorption and emission line profiles , @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 are the usual radiative ( einstein ) and collisional excitation and deexcitation coefficients , and @xmath32 is the angle averaged intensity .",
    "let us now define the _ divergence flux _ of the transition , @xmath159 :                  according to this equation the divergence flux seems to be equal to the probability that , once emitted at a distance @xmath27 from the surface , a photon can escape from the medium , which is called the  escape probability \" @xmath167 .",
    "several estimates of the escape probability are used in the literature ( see for example kwan & krolik , 1981 , rees , netzer & ferland , 1989 , kallman & mccray , 1982 , ko & kallman , 1994 ) , to account for partial redistribution , for line or continuum interlocking , and for continuum absorption .",
    "for instance several ways to take into account the continuum opacity ( or the overlapping of two lines ) have been proposed ( elitzur & netzer , 1984 , netzer , elitzur & ferland , 1985 ) . in the case of the broad line region of agn , which is optically thin for the continuum underlying the main lines , collin - souffrin et al .",
    "( 1981 ) , avrett & loeser ( 1988 ) , have discussed the influence of different approximations for partial or complete redistribution , and how they compare to an exact transfer treatment , and collin - souffrin & dumont s. ( 1986 ) have shown that the escape probability approximation is roughly valid ( it can however lead to a decrease by a factor as large as two of the ratio of a lower to a higher transition , such as h@xmath6/h@xmath88 or l@xmath6/h@xmath6 )",
    ".    however these approximations are not valid if @xmath174 is of the order of unity at the line frequency and if the line photons are created in one place and absorbed in another place where the physical conditions are different .",
    "this happens for instance for euv and soft x - ray lines created in the hot region and absorbed in ionizing he@xmath175 ions in a cooler region .",
    "if the local escape probability approximation breaks down , it has a severe consequence : _ the emitted line spectrum and the thermal and the ionization balance are not correctly computed_. for instance the divergence flux takes frequently negative values in our computations , even for intense lines , and even in the reflected spectrum .",
    "this is not allowed with escape probabilities .",
    "we illustrate this discussion with some examples in sect ."
