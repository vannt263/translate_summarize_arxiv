    "with the rapid development of computer processors , numerical simulations using the monte carlo method have become a well established tool for the study of proteins , polymers and spin - glass models . when a monte carlo simulation using metropolis importance sampling @xcite is carried out at a fixed temperature ,",
    "the quality of the data depends on the distance from criticality , and therefore , multiple computer runs should be performed for each temperature . in order to speed up the simulation several methods have been suggested to overcome problems such as slow dynamics which makes the metropolis algorithm inefficient , and to study systems with a rough energy landscape with multiple local minima in free energy .",
    "important examples are the cluster - flip swendsen - wang algorithm @xcite , which has been used to reduce critical slowing down at second order phase transitions , the multicanonical method @xcite which was introduced to overcome the barrier between coexisting phases at first order phase transitions , the broad histogram method @xcite which directly calculates the density of states with only one computer run , and the flat histogram method @xcite which generates a flat histogram in energy space similar to multicanonical simulations .",
    "the drawback of the flat histogram method is the slow diffusion of the random walk which is the same as in the multicanonical method .",
    "nevertheless , no method is more efficient than that recently proposed by wang and landau @xcite which allows one to get around these difficulties even for large systems .    in this work we present results of simulations of three - dimensional lattice polymer chains @xcite using wang - landau sampling , and calculate thermodynamic properties of the system .",
    "the method is described in sec .",
    "iii provides a brief background on the algorithm .",
    "the results are given in sec .",
    "iv and we summarize and conclude in sec . v.",
    "we consider a homopolymer consisting of @xmath0 monomers which may assume any self avoiding walk ( saw ) configuration on a three - dimensional lattice . assuming that the polymer is in a bad solvent",
    ", there is an effective monomer - monomer attraction in addition to the self - avoidance constraint representing excluded volume . for every pair of nonbonded nearest - neighbor monomers the energy of the polymer",
    "is reduced by @xmath1 ( see fig . [ inter ] ) .    [ !",
    "htb ]     therefore , the interaction between two nonbonded monomers @xmath2 and @xmath3 is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the lattice constant .",
    "the hamiltonian for the model can be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 @xmath8 if the site @xmath2 is occupied ( vacant ) , and the sum is over nearest - neighbor pairs @xcite .",
    "( the sum is understood to exclude pairs of bonded segments along the chain ) .",
    "we are interested in the equilibrium properties at temperature @xmath9 .",
    "( in the following , temperature is measured in units of @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the boltzman s constant . )    in order to generate a markov process for sampling configurations we have first to define a protocol of movements .",
    "we used the so - called reptation or _",
    "`` slithering snake '' _ move which consists of randomly adding a monomer to one end of the chain and removing a monomer from the other end , maintining the size of the polymer constant .",
    "we define one monte carlo step as @xmath0 attempted moves . at certain moments , one end of the chain may not be able to move , but successive motions of the other end release it from the trap .",
    "the wang - landau algorithm calculates the density of states @xmath12 by carrying out a random walk in energy space with an acceptance probability proportional to @xmath13 instead of the usual boltzmann weight @xmath14 used in the conventional monte carlo simulation . the probability of energy @xmath15 changes therefore from @xmath16 in the metropolis scheme to an almost constant probability in the wang - landau method . as a result",
    "the probability minimum which appears at first order phase transitions , for example , practically vanishes .",
    "the simulation is performed such that if @xmath17 is the energy of the current configuration and @xmath18 is the energy of a possible new configuration , the acceptance probability is given by @xmath19.\\ ] ] for each accepted configuration we accumulate an energy histogram @xmath20 . since the density of states is not known _ a priori _ , wang and landau proposed to set @xmath21 initially , for all energy levels .    to study large systems the energy space is divided into bins and the random walk",
    "is carried out independently in each segment . as the random walk in energy space",
    "is performed , whenever a move to a configuration with energy @xmath15 is accepted the density of states is updated by multiplying it by a  modification factor \" @xmath22 that accelerates the diffusion of the random walk , and an unit is added to the histogram @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath23 the initial choice of @xmath24 is @xmath25 .",
    "the density of states is multiplied by @xmath24 until the accumulated histogram @xmath20 is flat .",
    "we then reduce @xmath24 by setting @xmath26 and resetting @xmath27 for all energy values .",
    "this process is repeated ; the simulation converges to the true value of @xmath12 when @xmath24 is approximately @xmath28 . in our simulations",
    "the criterion of flatness was taken as each value of the histogram reaching at least @xmath29 of the mean value @xmath30 .",
    "the histograms are generally checked after each @xmath31 monte carlo steps .",
    "in this section we present results obtained for chains of lattice homopolymers using the wang - landau algorithm and compare them with those obtained using metropolis algorithm importance sampling . in fig .",
    "[ g50 ] we show the density of states for a chain of @xmath32 monomers .",
    "the ground state of this chain is @xmath33 . ]",
    "the ground state is achieved by shaping a configuration rolled up like a snail ( see fig .",
    "[ caracol ] ) .",
    "the energy of this configuration is obtained by counting the number of nonbonded nearest - neighbor pairs . in our simulations",
    "the polymer was always set initially in this configuration and , using the algorithm described above , the density of states was estimated as a result of a random walk in the energy space .    .",
    "in this case the energy is @xmath33 . ]    knowing the density of states , one can calculate any thermodynamic property @xmath34 of the system through the canonical average @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the microcanonical average of observable @xmath34 obtained during the simulation , @xmath12 is the density of states for each energy level @xmath15 , and @xmath37 is the partition function @xmath38    in monte carlo simulations using metropolis sampling we fix the temperature and determine the thermodynamic average @xmath39 . therefore a new simulation is needed for each value of temperature . in wang - landau sampling we estimate the density of states and then calculate any thermodynamic property of interest by means of a simple algebraic operation .",
    "the computational time in our simulations was about ten times smaller using the wang - landau method as compared with the metropolis algorithm .    in fig .",

    "[ dr2wlmt ] .",
    "the coil - globule phase transition is characterized by a peak in the derivative of @xmath43 similar to the specific heat .",
    "we believe that the low - temperature peak corresponds to excitations of the surface of the typlically compact , folded configuration .",
    "this effect is more pronounced in short chains .",
    "an advantage of this algorithm is that we can readily calculate the free energy and entropy , quantities that are not directly accessible in conventional monte carlo simulations . in terms of the density of states",

    "the entropy is a key thermodynamic quantity that can not be calculated directly by conventional monte carlo simulation .",
    "it can be estimated by integration over other thermodynamic quantities , such as specific heat , but these calculations are somewhat unreliable since the specific heat itself is not easy to estimate accurately . with an accurate density of states estimated by the wang - landau method , the entropy can be calculated simply using @xmath47    in fig .",

    "we show that the density of states directly obtained by this algorithm enables one to calculate thermodynamic properties even for large systems with only one computer run .",
    "we also note from the temperature dependence of the specific heat and the mean square end - to - end distance that the low - temperature region is better explored by this method than by standard monte carlo simulation .",
