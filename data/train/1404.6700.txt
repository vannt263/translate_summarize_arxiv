    "recently , wireless sensor networks ( wsns ) have attracted a great deal of research interest because of their unique features that allow a wide range of applications in the areas of defence , environment , health and home @xcite .",
    "wsns are usually composed of a large number of densely deployed sensing devices which can transmit their data to the desired destination through multihop relays @xcite . considering the traditional wireless networks such as cellular systems ,",
    "the primary goal in such systems is to provide high qos and bandwidth efficiency .",
    "the base stations have easy access to the power supply and the mobile user can replace or recharge exhausted batteries in the handset @xcite .",
    "however , power conservation is getting more important , especially for wsns .",
    "one of the most important constraints on wsns is the low power consumption requirement as sensor nodes carry limited , generally irreplaceable , power sources . therefore , low complexity and high energy efficiency are the most important design characteristics for wsns . in a cooperative wsn , nodes relay signals to each other in order to propagate redundant copies of the same signals to the destination nodes . among the existing relaying schemes , the amplify - and - forward ( af ) and the decode - and - forward ( df ) are the most popular approaches @xcite . in the af scheme ,",
    "the relay nodes amplify the received signal and rebroadcast the amplified signals toward the destination nodes . in the df scheme",
    ", the relay nodes first decode the received signals and then regenerate new signals to the destination nodes subsequently .",
    "some power allocation methods have been proposed for wsns to obtain the best possible signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) or best possible quality of service ( qos ) @xcite at the destinations . by adjusting appropriately the power levels used for the links between the sources , the relays and the destinations ,",
    "significant performance gains can be obtained for a given power budget .",
    "most of the research on power allocation for wsns are based on the assumption of perfect synchronization and available channel state information ( csi ) at each node .",
    "a wsn is said to have full csi when all of its nodes have access to accurate and up - to - date csi .",
    "when full csi is available to all the nodes , the power of each node can be optimally allocated to improve the system efficiency and lower the outage probability @xcite or bit error rate ( ber ) @xcite .    in wsns",
    ", some power allocation problems can be formulated as centralized or distributed optimization problems subject to power constraints on certain groups of signals . for the centralized schemes @xcite ,",
    "a network controller is required which is responsible for monitoring the information of the whole network such as the csi and snr , calculating the optimum power allocation parameters of each link and sending them to all nodes via feedback channels .",
    "this scheme considers all the available links but it has two major drawbacks .",
    "the first one is the high computational burden and storage demand at the network controller .",
    "the second one is that it requires a significant amount of control information provided by feedback channels which leads to a loss in bandwidth efficiency . for the distributed schemes @xcite , each node only needs to have the knowledge of its partner information and calculate its own power allocation parameter .",
    "therefore , a distributed scheme requires less control information and is ideally suited to wsns .",
    "however , the performance of distributed schemes is inferior to centralized schemes @xcite .    due to the inherent limitations in the sensor node size , power and cost @xcite ,",
    "they are only able to communicate in a short range .",
    "therefore , multihop communication @xcite is employed to enhance the coverage of wsns . by using multihop transmissions , the rapid decay of the received signal which is caused by the increased transmission distance",
    "can be overcome .",
    "moreover , pathways around the obstacles between the source and destination can be provided to avoid the signal shadowing @xcite .",
    "several works about power allocation of multihop transmission systems have been proposed in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the work reported in @xcite develops a cross - layer model for multihop communication and analyzes the energy consumption of multihop topologies with equal distance and optimal node spacing .",
    "centralized and distributed schemes for power allocation are presented to minimize the total transmission power under a constraint on the ber at the destination in @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "two optimal power allocation schemes are proposed to maximize the instantaneous received snr under short - term and long - term power constraints . in @xcite ,",
    "the outage probability is considered as the optimization criterion to derive the optimal power allocation schemes under a given power budget for both regenerative and non - regenerative systems .    in this paper , we consider a general multihop wsn where the af relaying scheme is employed .",
    "the proposed strategy is to jointly design the linear receivers and the power allocation parameters that contain the optimal complex amplification coefficients for each relay node via an alternating optimization approach @xcite .",
    "two kinds of linear receivers are designed , the minimum mean - square error ( mmse ) receiver and the maximum sum - rate ( msr ) receiver .",
    "they can be considered as solutions to constrained optimization problems where the objective function is the mean - square error ( mse ) cost function or the sum - rate ( sr ) and the constraint is a bound on the power levels among the relay nodes .",
    "then , the constrained mmse or msr expressions for the linear receiver and the power allocation parameter can be derived .",
    "the major novelty in these strategies presented here is that they are applicable to general multihop wsns with multi source nodes and destination nodes , as opposed to the simple two - hop wsns with one pair of source - destination nodes @xcite . unlike the previous works on the power allocation for multihop systems in @xcite-@xcite , in our work",
    ", the power allocation and receiver coefficients are jointly optimized .",
    "the joint strategies were proposed for a two - hop wsn with multiple relay nodes in our previous work @xcite . in order to increase the applicability of our investigation , in this paper ,",
    "we develop joint strategies for general multihop wsns .",
    "they can be considered as an extension of the strategies proposed for the two - hop wsns and more complex mathematical derivations are presented . moreover ,",
    "different kinds of power constraints can be considered and compared .",
    "for the mmse receiver , we present three strategies where the allocation of power level across the relay nodes is subject to global , local and individual power constraints . another fundamental contribution of this work is the derivation of a closed - form solution for the lagrangian multiplier ( @xmath0 ) that arises in the expressions of the power allocation parameters . for the msr receiver , the local power constraints are considered .",
    "we propose a strategy that employs iterations with the generalized rayleigh quotient @xcite to solve the optimization problem in an alternating fashion .",
    "some preliminary results of these work have been reported in @xcite .",
    "the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as :    1 ) : :    constrained mmse expressions for the design of linear receivers and    power allocation parameters for multihop wsns .",
    "the constraints include    the global , local and individual power constraints .",

    "consider a general @xmath1-hop wireless sensor network ( wsn ) with multiple parallel relay nodes for each hop , as shown in fig .",
    "the wsn consists of @xmath2 source nodes , @xmath3 destination nodes and @xmath4 relay nodes which are separated into @xmath5 groups : @xmath6 , @xmath7 , ... , @xmath8 .",
    "the index refers to the number of nodes after a given phase of transmission starting with @xmath9 and going up to @xmath5 .",
    "the proposed optimization algorithms in this paper refer to a particular instance , for which the roles of the nodes acted as sources , relays and destinations have been pre - detemined . in subsequent time slots these roles",
    "can be swapped so that all nodes can actually work as potential sources .",
    "we concentrate on a time division scheme with perfect synchronization , for which all signals are transmitted and received in separate time slots .",
    "the sources first broadcast the @xmath10 signal vector * s * which contains @xmath2 signals in parallel to the first group of relay nodes .",
    "we consider an amplify - and - forward ( af ) cooperation protocol in this paper .",
    "an extension to other cooperation protocols is straightforward .",
    "each group of relay nodes receives the signals , amplifies and rebroadcasts them to the next group of relay nodes ( or the destination nodes ) . in practice ,",
    "we need to consider the constraints on the transmission policy . for example , each transmitting node would transmit during only one phase . in our wsn system , we assume that each group of relay nodes transmits the signal to the nearest group of relay nodes ( or the destination nodes ) directly .",

    "the proposed joint msr designs can be stated as an alternating maximization strategy based on the sr defined in ( 47 ) that follows a similar procedure to the one above .",
    "in this section , we assess the performance of our proposed joint designs of the linear receiver and power allocation methods and compare them with the equal power allocation method which allocates the same transmitting power level equally for all links from the relay nodes . for the purpose of fairness ,",
    "we assume that the total transmitting power for all relay nodes in the network is the same which can be indicated as @xmath223 .",

    "the quasi - static fading channel ( block fading channel ) is considered in our simulations whose elements are rayleigh random variables ( with zero mean and unit variance ) and assumed to be invariant during the transmission of each packet . in our simulations ,",
    "the channel is assumed to be known at the destination nodes . for channel estimation algorithms for wsns and other low - complexity parameter estimation algorithms ,",
    "one refers to @xcite and @xcite . during each phase ,",
    "the sources transmit the qpsk modulated packets with 1500 symbols .",
    "the noise at the destination nodes is modeled as circularly symmetric complex gaussian random variables with zero mean . a perfect ( error free ) feedback channel between destination nodes and relay nodes",
    "is assumed to transmit the amplification coefficients .    for the mmse design , it can be seen from fig .",
    "5 that our three proposed methods achieve a better performance than the equal power allocation method . among them , the method with a global constraint has the best performance whereas the method with individual constraints has the worst performance .",
    "this result is what we expect because a global constraint provides the largest degrees of freedom for allocating the power among the relay nodes whereas an individual constraint provides the least . for the msr design",
    ", it can be seen from fig . 6",
    "that our proposed method achieves a better sum - rate performance than the equal power allocation method . using the power method to calculate the dominant eigenvector yields a very similar result to the qr algorithm but requires a lower complexity .            besides the equal power allocation scheme , a mmse power allocation scheme reported in @xcite where",
    "only the local power constraints are considered has also been used for comparison .",
    "it can be seen from fig . 7",
    "that our proposed mmse and msr designs can achieve a very similar or better performance .",
    "further advantage is that our proposed schemes only optimize the relay amplifying vectors ( or diagonal matrices ) whereas in @xcite the optimal relay amplifying matrices are needed which requires more feedback transmissions as well as information exchanges among relay nodes in each group .",
    "note that in order to have a fair comparison , we only employ power allocation schemes for the relay nodes and assume every source node has unit transmitting power in the simulations .     and equal power allocation scheme.,width=336 ]    in practice",
    ", the feedback channel can not be error free . in order to study the impact of feedback channel errors on the performance",
    ", we employ the binary symmetric channel ( bsc ) as the model for the feedback channel and quantize each complex amplification coefficient to an 8-bit binary value ( 4 bits for the real part , 4 bits for the imaginary part ) .",
    "the error probability ( pe ) of the bsc is fixed at @xmath226 .",
    "the dashed curves in fig . 5 and fig . 6",
    "show the performance degradation compared to the performance when using a perfect feedback channel . to show the performance tendency of the bsc for other values of pe",

    "the performance curves are shown in fig . 8 and fig .",
    "9 , which illustrate the ber and the sum - rate performance versus pe of our two proposed joint designs of the receivers .",
    "it can be seen that along with the increase in pe , their performance becomes   worse .",
    "finally , we replace the perfect csi with the estimated channel coefficients to compute the receive filters and power allocation parameters at the destinations .",
    "we employ the beacon channel estimation which was proposed in @xcite .",
    "10 illustrates the impact of the channel estimation on the performance of our proposed mmse and smr design with local constraints by comparing it to the performance of perfect csi .",
    "the quantity @xmath228 denotes the number of training sequence symbols per data packet .",
    "please note that in these simulations perfect feedback channel is considered and the qr algorithm is used in the msr design .",
    "for both the mmse and msr designs , it can be seen that when @xmath228 is set to 10 , the beacon channel estimation leads to an obvious performance degradation compared to the perfect csi .",
    "however , when @xmath228 is increased to 50 , the beacon channel estimation can achieve a similar performance to the perfect csi .",
    "other scenarios and network topologies have been investigated and the results show that the proposed algorithms work very well with channel estimation algorithms and a small number of training  symbols .",
    "in this paper , we have presented alternating optimization algorithms for receive filter design and power adjustment which can be applied to general multihop wsns .",
    "mmse and msr criteria have been considered in the development of the algorithmic solutions .",
    "simulations have shown that our proposed algorithms achieve a significant better performance than the equal power allocation and power allocation scheme in @xcite .",
    "a possible extension of this work is employing low - complexity adaptive algorithms to compute the linear receiver and power allocation parameters .",
