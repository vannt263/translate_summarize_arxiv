    "low energy electrons obeying the relativistic dirac equation have been reported in so - called dirac materials such as graphene.@xcite many intriguing physical properties of dirac fermions have been investigated both theoretically and experimentally , including the unconventional quantum hall effect , klein tunneling , suppressed back scattering , and so on.@xcite dirac materials are also reported in topological insulators,@xcite iron pnictides,@xcite organic conductors,@xcite inverse perovskite,@xcite and the vo@xmath0tio@xmath0 interface,@xcite with the list is rapidly growing these days .",
    "the effective hamiltonian in all those systems is characterized by the pauli matrices , which is essential to manifest spinor - related phenomena .",
    "recently , an anisotropic dirac cone in srmnbi@xmath0 was found by a density functional theory ( dft ) calculation and confirmed by angle revolved photoemission spectroscopy and quantum oscillations.@xcite it is characterized by linear dispersions with strong anisotropy in the momentum - dependent fermi velocity .",
    "such a dirac band near the fermi level mainly results from the bi square net layer,@xcite and is responsible for a finite berry phase in the shubnikov  de haas oscillations@xcite and the linear - field dependence of the magnetoresistance.@xcite similar behavior was also found in camnbi@xmath0 with the same bi square net.@xcite this indicates that the low energy electron motion in the bi square net can be described by the dirac hamiltonian .",
    "so far , however , the origin of the dirac fermions in the bi squre net has not yet been investigated clearly .",
    "so , this paper is devoted to studying the origin of the anisotropic dirac electrons observed in srmnbi@xmath0 and camnbi@xmath0 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii explains the crystal structure of the two compounds and the details of the dft calculation . in section iii",
    ", the dft band structures containing the dirac dispersion are presented . in section iv , we clarify the mechanism of the anisotropic dirac dispersion as well as the chirality of the dirac electron by using a tight binding ( tb ) method . also , the effect of the spin ",

    "finally , we conclude our paper in section v.     ( color online ) crystal structures of ( a ) srmnbi@xmath0 and ( b ) camnbi@xmath0 , whose crystal symmetries and atomic positions are listed in table i. bi(1 ) and bi(2 ) indicate the first and second types of bi atoms , respectively .",

    "the primitive unit cell , which is used for the dft calculation , has the same volume as that of the conventional unit cell for ( b ) but for ( a ) , it is one - half of that.,width=321 ]",
    "figure 1 shows the crystal structures of srmnbi@xmath0 ( sg 139 , i4/mmm ) and camnbi@xmath0 ( sg 129 , p4/nmm ) .",
    "both compounds contain a square net of bi atoms which are indicated by the red ( dark gray ) balls .",
    "the sr or ca atoms are located at the pyramid top of four base bi atoms , where the vertical distance varies from 2.5 to 2.7  . each sr or ca layer",
    "has a checkerboard ordering with respect to the bi square net .",
    "there exist other buffer layers containing mn - bi tetrahedrons .",
    "so there are two types of bi atoms in the unit cell : bi(1 ) in the square net and bi(2 ) in the mn - bi layer .",
    "the stacking configuration of the two alkaline earth atomic layers above and below the bi square net is different for srmnbi@xmath0 from that of camnbi@xmath0 .",
    "as one can see in fig . 1 or more schematically in fig . 5",
    ", each sr ( ca ) of one side appears at the overlapped ( alternate ) position of the same element at the other side .",
    "due to this difference , srmnbi@xmath0 ( camnbi@xmath0 ) has a body - centered ( primitive ) tetragonal bravais lattice .",
    "the experimental structural parameters of camnbi@xmath0 and srmnbi@xmath0 are listed in table i.    .[table1 ] experimental structural parameters used for the dft calculation .",
    "bi(1 ) and bi(2 ) indicate the first and second types of bi atoms , respectively , as shown in fig . 1 . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      on the bi square net and their next - nearest hopping strengths @xmath1 ( solid ) and @xmath2 ( dashed ) which contribute to the formation of dirac bands .",
    "the gray circles are the schematic representation of the perturbation potential by the stacked sr or ca layers .",
    "( a ) srbi lattice has the overlapped stacking of sr atoms near the bi square net to induce different @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "( b ) cabi lattice has the alternate stacking of ca atoms near the bi square net to induce the same @xmath1 and @xmath2.,width=321 ]    in the description of camnbi@xmath0 , the ca atoms are located at @xmath3 and @xmath4 , as shown in fig .",
    "similarly , the ca @xmath5 orbitals are hybridized with the bi @xmath6 orbitals .",
    "so a 14@xmath714 tb hamiltonian @xmath8 is given below with the onsite energy @xmath9 of the ca @xmath5 orbital .",
    "@xmath10 the matrix elements of @xmath11 are listed in table iv .    in figs .",
    "8(a ) and 8(b ) , we compare the band structures obtained by the dft and tb methods , respectively .",
    "qualitative agreement is obtained by using the tb parameters @xmath12 ev , @xmath13 ev , and @xmath14 ev . in contrast to the srbi layer , the degeneracy along the line - type fs is not lifted , as can be seen from fig .",
    "8(d ) clearly shows the almost zero gap along the continuous line @xmath15 .    the distinct electronic structures between the srbi and the cabi lattices arise from the different arrangements of the alkaline earth atoms with respect to the bi square net .",
    "this can be understood using perturbation theory for the first - order degenerate states .",
    "the two degenerate states along @xmath15 are unperturbed eigenstates .",
    "the perturbation potential @xmath16 by the adjacent @xmath17 ( = sr or ca ) atomic layers gives the following energy eigenvalue difference ( see the appendix for a detailed derivation ) .",
    "@xmath18 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the coupling terms of @xmath19 between the next - nearest neighboring orbitals , as illustrated in fig .",
    "9 . when two @xmath17 atomic layers have overlapped stacking as in the case of srbi , the perturbation @xmath19 results in @xmath20 as shown in fig .",
    "for this reason , a linear dispersion of @xmath21 is obtained along @xmath15 .",
    "this is consistent with the anisotropic dirac cone feature of srmnbi@xmath0 .",
    "but , when two @xmath17 atomic layers have alternate stacking as in cabi , @xmath22 , as is shown in fig .",
    "this causes @xmath23 .",
    "so the degeneracy is not lifted , which is consistent with the result for camnbi@xmath0 .      in the anisotropic dirac band of the srbi lattice ,",
    "the original two bands in the folded zone are associated with symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of two bi sublattice orbitals . in other words ,",
    "the eigenstate is @xmath24 at a certain * k * on one side of the dirac point , while it is @xmath25 on the other side .",
    "a state with @xmath26 needs to be changed continuously to another state with @xmath27 around the dirac point .",
    "if we associate @xmath28 with up / down spinor states , the momentum * k * and the ( pseudo)spinor are coupled to each other , giving rise to a specific chirality .",
    "together with the linear variation of the energy eigenvalues with @xmath29 , this coupling is generally described by the weyl equation , which involves the pauli matrices @xmath30 .",
    "such a hamiltonian gives a value for berry s phase of @xmath31 when a state is scattered back to the original @xmath32 state while going around @xmath33 .",
    "for this reason , the back scattering is suppressed , as is known for graphene and materials with strong spin ",
    "orbit couplings.@xcite this also can explain the abnormal phase observed in the quantum oscillation experiments .    in order to study the chirality",
    ", we express an eigenstate as a superposition of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , that is , @xmath36 .",
    "one needs to find a unitary matrix that transforms @xmath37 into spinor states with @xmath38 .",
    "such a transformation @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 for a given @xmath41 , one obtains the expectation values of @xmath42 as @xmath43 with @xmath44 . for @xmath45 , they are evaluated as @xmath46 , @xmath47 . for @xmath48 , @xmath49 , which vanishes as long as @xmath50 ,",

    ", we calculate @xmath52 for each of the hole and electron tb states , to represent two - component vector fields @xmath53 . as shown in fig .",
    "10(a ) , there are four dirac points in the first brillouin zone , @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",

    "for all cases , the vector rotates by 2@xmath31 along the closed @xmath32 loop , i.e. , it has a winding number of 1 .",
    "also when @xmath58 , the hole is purely a @xmath59 state at negative ( positive ) @xmath56 as we expect , but it is reversed for the electron case .",
    "so the chirality is the opposite for the hole state from the electron state . from fig .",
    "10(b ) , the arrow rotates clockwise as one follows the contour line counter - clockwise in both hole and electron states around ( @xmath60 , @xmath60 ) or ( @xmath61 , @xmath61 ) .",
    "in contrast , around ( @xmath61 , @xmath60 ) or ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) , the rotation is the opposite , as shown in fig .",

    "for the case of srbi without an soc , @xmath72 , we simply use the @xmath53 results of fig .",

    "is shown in fig .",
    "11(a ) .",
    "the soc - induced splitting does not need to occur at every @xmath32 point where the @xmath109 band crosses the @xmath101 band . in order to explain this",
    ", we show the @xmath110 bands whose local orbitals are given by @xmath111 and @xmath112 without taking into consideration @xmath85 .",
    "those bands have no hybridization with each other , as can be seen in fig .",
    "along the direction from @xmath113 to m , each @xmath114 band crosses the @xmath115 bands twice .",
    "the leading contribution of the perturbation @xmath85 is of second order , which is given by @xmath116 .",
    "the main factor is due to the fact that @xmath117 is non - vanishing only when the values of @xmath118 are equal to each other for @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "for this reason , @xmath121 breaks the degeneracy only at the point where two crossing bands have the same @xmath118 .",
    "the linear crossing behavior along lines of high symmetry is quite common in ( transition ) metal compounds . but srmnbi@xmath0 possesses distinguishing features that cause the anisotropic dirac fermions as observed in experiments .",
    "the main factors can be summarized as follows .",
    "first , the bi @xmath6 band is folded due to the unit cell doubling .",
    "this gives rise to a linear crossing of folded bands without lifting the degeneracy , which is rather common .",
    "second , the two - fold rotational symmetry of the perturbing potential by adjacent atomic layers lifts the degeneracy except at the dirac point .",
    "third , and most importantly , the anisotropic dirac cone mainly contributes to the electronic properties at the fermi level .",
    "we have seen that most of the other bands are absent near the fermi level .",
    "this is because the mn - related bands are well spin - polarized and separated away from the fermi level due to the antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "also the dirac cone exhibits an exceedingly high fermi velocity compared to the other fermi pockets , dominating the electron transport properties . in these respects",
    ", srmnbi@xmath0 is quite unique .",
    "the chirality that we obtained for srbi , i.e. , in fig .",
    "10 , is almost identical to that of graphene .",
    "a superficial difference of srmnbi@xmath0 from graphene is that the dirac cone is highly anisotropic .",
    "so , the contribution of the anisotropy to the transport properties deserves further investigation .",
    "also it is not clear how the two types of dirac cone shown in figs . 10(b ) and 10(c ) are related to each other .",
    "for example , two inequivalent dirac cones in graphene are related by the time - reversal transformation .",
    "furthermore , srmnbi@xmath0 contains a significant soc of bi , in contrast to graphene .",
    "as one can see in fig .",
    "3(a ) , it has a sizable energy gap at the dirac point and a significant electron ",
    "hole asymmetry due to the soc .",
    "in such a case , berry s phase can not be quantized to be @xmath122 , as it is in graphene .",
    "rather it should show a deviation from @xmath31 .",
    "we have not included the interlayer interaction in the tb calculation of the srbi and cabi layers .",
    "such an omission is reasonable from the highly two dimensional nature of the fermi surfaces in the dft result in fig .",
    "it is far from being a completely two dimensional system , as one can see a little dump near the @xmath123=0 for the anisotropic fermi pocket in fig .",
    "4 . a slight dispersion will originate from the indirect coupling through the insulating mnbi layers . in spite of there being little interlayer interaction ,",
    "the anisotropic dirac behavior is equally reproduced by the dft method , i.e. , the dft results shown in figs .",
    "3(a ) and ( b ) , in comparison with the tb results , figs .",
    "7(c ) and 8(c ) , respectively .",
    "this suggests that the indirect coupling does not destroy the anisotropic dirac nature , which explains the dirac fermions observed in some three dimensional systems such as iron pnictides , topological insulators , organic conductors , and so on .",
    "the dft results show the presence of an anisotropic dirac cone in srmnbi@xmath0 .",
    "but , in camnbi@xmath0 the band crossing occurs along a continuous line in momentum space . from the tb analysis ,",
    "we conclude that the anisotropic potential created by the sr atoms is a main factor for the anisotropic dirac band .",
    "our study indicates that the nature of the dirac dispersion is sensitive to the nearest neighbor interaction in the bi square net .",
    "so , it would be interesting to investigate the dirac nature of the bi square net with further changes , such as structural distortions or magnetism .",
    "this work was supported by the national research foundation of korea ( nrf ) funded by the ministry of education , science and technology ( grants nos .",

    "a single bi square net layer is regarded as an unperturbed system . at each @xmath32 with @xmath124 , two bands touch at the fermi wavevectors as shown in fig .",
    "their symmetries are given by @xmath125 and @xmath28 .",
    "the unperturbed eigenvalues are @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",

    "the @xmath32 line of the band crossing satisfies @xmath133 .",
    "the dirac point @xmath134 has @xmath135 .",
    "also , from @xmath125 , the unperturbed eigenstates can be written as a linear combination of local orbitals , such as @xmath136 and @xmath137 with the lattice vector @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "so they are expressed by @xmath140 e^{i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}},\\ ] ] where @xmath141 and @xmath142 give the bonding and anti - bonding states , respectively .",
    "now we consider the perturbation by the additional potential of @xmath17 ( = sr or ca ) atomic layers .",
    "each @xmath17 atomic potential is assumed to be an isotropic potential @xmath143 , to give the total potential @xmath144 for the case illustrated in fig .",
