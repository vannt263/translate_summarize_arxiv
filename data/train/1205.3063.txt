    "the investigation of quantum and statistical properties of bose - gases in low and especially in one dimension ( 1d ) has evoked indefatigable interest in atomic optics and condensed matter physics for the last few decades , see e.g. @xcite . in particular , at finite temperatures for a 1d or 2d ideal bose gases a true bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) can only be reached in the presence of a suitable trapping potential @xcite , and the critical temperature for the phase transition depends on the shape of trapping potential , which is usually harmonic in practice , cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "low - dimensional systems have been studied using atoms in highly deformed traps @xcite where effects of dimensional reduction become important @xcite .",
    "alternative systems are bosonic quasiparticles , where light and matter are coupled in a coherent way ",
    "see e.g. @xcite . here quantum and statistical properties of light bose - quasiparticles , like excitons @xcite , magnons @xcite and polaritons ( see e.g. @xcite ) have been considered .",
    "for example , exciton - polaritons occurring in quantum well structures placed in microcavities can be treated as a _",
    "2d gas _ of bosonic particles having an effective mass which is many orders smaller than the mass of an electron in vacuum .",
    "this allows to study relatively high - temperature phase transitions in low - dimensional bosonic systems .",
    "recently , the evidence of a kosterlitz - thouless phase transition  cf .",
    "@xcite , superfluid behaviour of exciton - polaritons in such systems , has been reported by many labs , @xcite . however , in the current semiconductor structures the thermalization time is in the picoseconds domain and comparable with the particle lifetime , thus we deal here with non - equilibrium `` condensates '' @xcite , for which dissipative and optical pumping effects play a crucial role , cf .",
    "the characteristic temperatures for these condensates are a few ten kelvins , which is far above the atomic condensates , but still far below room temperature .",
    "recently room - temperature bose - einstein - condensation of photons has been observed @xcite , where the photons are confined in a 2d curved - mirror optical microresonator filled with a dye solution .",
    "thermalization of the photon gas is established by thermal contact between the photons and the dye solution , using repeated absorption and re - emission processes in the dye solution @xcite .",
    "frequent collisions , on a timescale much faster than the excited state lifetime lead to a decoupling of photons and dye molecules , thus the relevant particles are not polaritons but photons ( see @xcite ) in these experiments .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss a different approach to reach a high ( room and beyond ) temperature phase transition with mixed matter - field states - polaritons in an atomic medium .",
    "in particular , dressed - sate polaritons , where a light field is coherently and strongly coupled to a two - level atom , leading to a bosonic quasiparticle ( in a suitable limit ) are attractive candidate due to their potentially longer lifetime , cf , @xcite . in this system thermal equilibrium of coupled atom - light ( dressed ) states",
    "can be achieved experimentally within a nanosecond domain and is limited by the natural lifetime of the two - level atoms . here ,",
    "optical collisions ( ocs ) with buffer gas atoms can lead to thermalization , experimentally evidence for a thermal quasi - equilibrium of coupled atom - light states has been found @xcite . the obtained time of thermalization have been about ten times shorter than the natural lifetime at full optical power . here , the limited available power in the light field prevented a full thermalization .",
    "to overcome this problem , in @xcite special metallic waveguides of various configurations with the length up to a few millimeters have been considered for trapping the polaritons inside , similar to waveguides and closed resonators examined for the confinement of microwave irradiation , cf .",
    "the lifetime of photon - like polaritons trapped in the waveguide can be longer than the thermalization time , and is mainly determined by the cavity @xmath0-factor .",
    "thus we expect in such a waveguide that for a large and negative atom - field detuning a high - temperature phase transition to a superradiant state of the polaritons can be reached @xcite .    in the paper we study thermodynamic and critical properties of dressed state polaritons trapped in a biconical waveguide , i.e. metallic microtubes with different geometry @xcite .",
    "in this case one can study the thermodynamics of a 1d quantum gas , which exhibits a high temperature phase transition to a bec in the case of a trapping potential which is more confining than harmonic @xcite .",
    "for this reason we consider waveguides with a biconical shape , which leads to a trapping potential in propagation direction . throughout the paper , we assume the strong coupling limit , i.e. the eigenstates of the coupled atom - light system are treated as polaritons . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the waveguide cavity model for confinement of the optical mode . to be more specific , we consider field properties in an empty lossless metallic biconical waveguide cavity ( bwc ) where the photons are confined in transversal and trapped in longitudinal dimension . in sec .",
    "iii we give a quantum description of the atom - field interaction in the waveguide , and the problem of specifying waveguide parameters in the limit of weak trapping is considered .",
    "thermodynamic properties of the 1d ideal gas of photon - like polaritons are examined , where we find a phase transition to a bec state at experimentally feasible temperatures . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss the dynamical properties of condensed lb polartions . in the conclusion ,",
    "we summarize the results obtained .",
    "we start by describing the problem of photon trapping in the empty bwc , sketched in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "we assume metallic boundary conditions , and for the case of simplicity the cavity is assumed to be lossless .",
    "the radius of the cylindrically symmetric waveguide depends on @xmath1 following @xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 being a function increasing monotonically with @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath6 for @xmath7 , similar to bottle resonators based on glass materials ( and with relatively large diameter ) , see ref .",
    "we here focus on waveguides with a maximal diameter that is close to the wavelength of the optical field . in this limit",
    "it is possible to guarantee a spacing of the transverse modes above the thermal energy , which allows for the transverse mode quantum numbers to be frozen .",
    "the system becomes effectively one - dimensional , with a continuum of longitudinal modes above a low frequency cutoff . for a suitable density of states",

    "let us briefly summarize the results obtained .",
    "we have considered the problem the thermodynamics for polaritons emerging due to the interaction of two - level rubidium atoms with an optical field in the presence of ocs with buffer gas particles .",
    "we assume the optical field to be trapped inside a biconical waveguide filled with rubidium atoms , and we find conditions for effective trapping of the coupled atom - light system .",
    "in particular , we find a phase transition to a bec of polaritons if relation is fulfilled , a condition that substantially depends on a cavity mode structure and @xmath12-parameter characterizing slow changing of waveguide radius along longitudinal coordinate .",
    "we analyze the problem of bec formation for lower branch atomic polaritons trapped in the bwc under the quasiclassical approach ( [ eq17 ] ) , ( [ eq25 _ ] ) , and we find that atomic polaritons formed in the waveguide may be treated as 1d ideal gas of bosonic quasiparticles in the framework of current experimental results achieved for the thermalization of coupled atom - light states in the presence of strong atom - field coupling regime .    even though the character of the dressed - state polaritons discussed in the paper is nearly photon - like , they represent mixed states of photons and excitations of two - level atomic system . in this sense",
    "they are physically close to exciton - polaritons obtained in semiconductor microcavities , cf .",
    "however , our estimations show that the critical temperature of the bec phase transition can exceed the temperature of 530 k currently used in experiments , thus being high enough to be observed using appropriate waveguide parameters and cavity modes .",
    "such high critical temperatures can not be achieved for exciton - polaritons in the current narrow - band semiconductor microstructures due to exciton ionization effects .",
    "the main reason for the high transition temperature is the photon - like character of the polaritons , i.e. their low effective mass .",
    "this , together with the thermalization due to optical collisions , may allow to experimentally observe a high temperature phase transition of dressed state polaritons using realistic parameters .",
    "in a more detailed study we have investigated the case of a biconical cavity leading to a linear trapping potential of polariton gas .",
    "we are aware that the transverse decoherence rate needs to be studied in more detail for the considered system to ensure the strong coupling limit . using variational techniques we find",
    "the ground state wavefunction to be airy - shaped , where the width @xmath252 exhibits small amplitude oscillations in time around a stationary state when the bec is excited , with a characteristic period in the picosecond domain for current experiments .",
    "the results obtained indicate that the observation of a corresponding thermodynamic phase transition is possible already in current experimental setups , given the described waveguide structures are prepared with the required accuracy .",
