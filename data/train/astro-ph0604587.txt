    "the dissipative baryonic matter cools and condenses in dark matter halo @xcite .",
    "@xcite described the halo response to this condensation assuming a spherical profile with circular orbits and adiabatic disk growth @xcite .",
    "for an adiabatic change , the angular momentum is invariant : @xmath1 . then , given the distribution of the baryonic disk @xmath2 and the initial dark matter distribution @xmath3 , the final distribution of dark matter @xmath4 must satisfy @xmath5 where @xmath6 is mass fraction of the disk .",
    "further studies of this model include @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite find that the adiabatic contraction approximation is in agreement with their simulations .    despite the wide usage of the adiabatic contraction approximation ,",
    "discrepancies between observations and theoretical predictions motivate a detailed check of its validity .",
    "first , @xcite simply assumes that the disk growth time is much longer than the dark matter halo dynamical time . however , individual halos may grow simultaneously with their disks and have different assembly histories @xcite .",
    "cosmological simulations of the galaxy formation have shown that gas accretion in cdm halos proceeds in two distinct modes depending on the mass of the halo @xcite . in massive halos ,",
    "gas accretion is dominated by `` hot mode '' in which gas is first heated up to the virial temperature of the halo and then cools to settle gradually into the halo centre . by contrast",
    ", gas accretion into small halos is dominated by `` cold mode '' in which cold gas sinks in a dynamical time without being shock heated .",
    "these scenarios may affect the validity of the adiabatic contraction formula .",
    "secondly , dark matter is not arranged on circular orbits and therefore @xmath7 is not strictly conserved .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite report that the approximation overestimates the contraction measured in simulations .",
    "moreover , recently @xcite claimed similar findings in a cosmological simulation .",
    "these authors suggest that the discrepancy is due to the circular orbit assumption .    in this paper",
    ", we use idealised numerical experiments to investigate the effect of the two assumptions in the adiabatic contraction approximation ( eq . [ eq_ad ] ) and provide physical intuition for the numerical trends . in  [ sec : timing ] , we use one - dimensional simulations which incorporate dark matter halo mass accretion history as well as gas cooling to test the adiabatic disk growth assumption in realistic forming halo . we find that disk growth time scale is always longer than dynamical time of the halo in many cases . we also show that the continued dark - matter mass accretion has little affect in the inner halo . in  [ sec : halo ] , we test the circular orbit assumption using high resolution n - body simulations with cosmological dark matter halo initial conditions . as expected , we find that radial orbits reduce the dark matter halo response to disk growth predicted by the simple circular - orbit approach . however , in order to maintain an isotropic velocity distribution in cuspy halos , a circular population is much larger than radial orbit population .",
    "this explains the often - observed consistency between simulations of a dark - matter cuspy halo to disk growth .",
    "we study typical cdm halos in  [ sec : typical ] and summarise in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we investigate a dark matter halo response to disk growth for several different halo and disk growth time scales using one - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations ( see appendix a and * ? ? ?",
    "we use @xmath8 equal - mass shells to represent the dark matter distribution and 500 equal - mass shells to represent the gas distribution .",
    "the evolution of every gas shell is followed until it cools below @xmath9k ; thereafter its mass is assigned to an exponential disk .",
    "the scale - length of the disk , @xmath10 , is fixed to @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the virial radius of the halo at @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the disk is assumed to be a rigid exponential disk .",
    "we examine both an early- ( @xmath14 ) and late- ( @xmath15 ) time halo - formation scenarios with @xmath16 .",
    "because the virial mass of the halo is fixed at @xmath17 , gas accretion is primarily in the `` hot mode '' phase for this halo mass @xcite .",
    "the gas is heated to the virial temperature and then slowly cools to form a disk . in order to examine the adiabatic contraction for the `` cold mode '' gas accretion , we artificially increase cooling rate by a factor of 100 .",
    "then , the accreted gas cools rapidly and joins the disk without shock heating .",
    "in this case , the disk and its host halo have similar growth times .",
    "for the four simulations , two redshifts and two accretion models , we measure the rotation curves at the present time , which are shown in figure [ fig : mah ] .",
    "since disk growth time is longer than dynamical time of the dark matter halo in all four , the adiabatic contraction approximation adequately predict the response of dark matter halos .",
    "although the host halo continues to accrete dark matter , this accretion primarily affects the outer halo . in summary",
    ", the adiabatic contraction formula gives an acceptable approximation for these standard scenarios .",
    "= 1.0    = 1.0    we explore disk growth in a dark matter halo represented by a profile , @xmath18}$ ] with virial radius @xmath19 .",
    "we assume a concentration @xmath20 consistent with the rotation curve for a large spiral galaxy and examine three cases of different anisotropy to study the effects of radial orbits on the circular - orbit adiabatic prediction : a circular - orbit halo , an isotropic halo , and a radial orbit biased halo .",
    "the nfw halo with pure circular orbits is constructed by assigning each of the particles at radius @xmath21 a tangential velocity , @xmath22 in a random tangential direction .",
    "the isotropic and radially biased distribution functions are computed using the osipkov - merritt model @xcite which controls the orbital structure by an anisotropy radius @xmath23 . for an isotropic halo , @xmath24 .",
    "for the radially biased case , we choose the minimum value for @xmath25 that results in positive density .",
    "the anisotropy profile in this model closely corresponds to the profile from a virialized collapse @xcite .",
    "the @xmath26-particle phase spaces are realized by a monte carlo procedure .",
    "our rigid exponential disk has mass @xmath27 and the disk scale length is @xmath28 motivated by galaxy formation in @xmath0cdm cosmogony @xcite . to mimic disk growth",
    ", we increase the disk mass from zero , keeping the disk scale length unchanged . to ensure the validity of the adiabatic approximation , the time scale of disk mass growth is 10 times longer than the dynamical time of the dark matter halo at the disk scale length .",
    "the gravitational force on each dark matter particle is calculated using the self - consistent field code ( scf ) @xcite , which solves poisson s equation using a set of density - potential bi - orthogonal function expansions .",
    "figure [ fig : orbit ] shows the total rotation curves after disk contraction for the circular orbit case ( long dashed curve ) , the isotropic case ( dotted curve ) and the radial orbit biased case ( dot - dashed curve ) . for comparison , we also show the prediction of the adiabatic contraction approximation ( solid curve ) .",
    "the adiabatic contraction approximation is nearly exact for circular orbits , but overestimates the contraction when the eccentric orbit contribution increases .",
    "the radial orbit biased halo model is not significantly biased toward radial orbit around disk ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "consequently the effect of radial orbit is not dramatic in figure [ fig : orbit ] .",
    "however it is clear that the radial orbit reduces the dark matter halo response .",
    "since it is difficult to simulate pure radial orbit halos in three - dimensional n - body simulation , we use implement one - dimensional simulation with a pure radial orbit halo .",
    "the orbits are purely radial and the density profile of the simulated halo is proportional to @xmath30 in central region .",
    "figure [ fig : radial ] shows the rotation curve of the simulated halo compared with the prediction of adiabatic contraction formula .",
    "the circular - orbit prediction overestimates the contraction by factor of two .",
    "we consider a range of halo parameters and disk masses to explore the general applicability of the circular - orbit adiabatic approximation .",
    "recent cosmological simulations show that velocities in the inner region of dark matter halos is isotropic @xcite .",
    "therefore we explore isotropic halos .",
    "although an nfw halo model is currently accepted in cdm cosmology , some recent theoretical models @xcite and observations @xcite suggest that dark halos may have cores .",
    "simulations for the core halo are also carried for the three cases , with @xmath31 , 12 , and 7.5 , respectively .",
    "in addition to the fiducial disk , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , we consider a low - mass ( @xmath34 ) and a high - mass ( @xmath35 ) disk .",
    "figure [ fig : vhalo ] compares the post - formation rotation curves for nfw halos and core halos with @xmath36 and @xmath37 with the adiabatic contraction predictions .",
    "the formula overestimates the rotation velocity for these astronomically motivated halo models although the discrepancy is modest .",
    "figure [ fig : error ] quantifies the relative differences , @xmath38 , as a function of halo concentration @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the circular velocities at @xmath42 obtained from simulation and from the adiabatic contraction ( eq . [ eq_ad ] ) , respectively .",
    "the discrepancy is 4% for nfw model with @xmath36 and increases to 8% for @xmath37 .",
    "the discrepancy increases with disk mass but the dependence is weak .",
    "the @xmath37 case is a low value for galaxy halos in the current cdm model , therefore , these results show that the adiabatic contraction approximation remains good for isotropic nfw halos . for core halos ,",
    "the discrepancy is 14% for @xmath36 and increases to 23% for @xmath37 with weak dependence on @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite improved the agreement between the adiabatic contraction approximation and the simulation result using a modified version of the original adiabatic contraction approximation including the effect of non - circular orbits . in this model ,",
    "the adiabatic invariant @xmath43 is replaced by @xmath44 , where @xmath45 .",
    "the authors suggested @xmath46 and @xmath47 based on cosmological dark matter halo simulations .",
    "as comparison , we show in figure [ fig : vhalo ] the rotation curves obtained from this modified adiabatic contraction approximation , together with those obtained from the simulation and from the original adiabatic contraction approximation . as one can see , the modified adiabatic contraction approximation agrees with the simulation results for nfw halos . for halos with a constant density core",
    ", there is clear discrepancy between the model and simulation , although the modified model is better than the original adiabatic contraction model .",
    "although the @xcite model takes the effect of non - circular orbits into account , their fitting formula , @xmath45 , is not based on the orbital structure .",
    "it simply reduces the halo contraction using fitting formula with empirically suggested fitting parameters . therefore the @xcite model estimation for core halo cases with suggested fitting parameters",
    "does not work as well as one for nfw halo cases .",
    "for core halo , different fitting parameters and further modification in fitting formula are required .",
    "figure [ fig : error ] shows that the adiabatic contraction approximation is better for high - concentration halos .",
    "this trend is explained by the distribution of orbits .",
    "we describe the shape of an orbit by the ratio of the angular momentum to the angular momentum of a circular orbit at a fixed energy @xmath48 .",
    "the orbit with @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) is radial ( circular ) .",
    "figure [ fig : kappa ] describes the ensemble average of this ratio for isotropic halo in radial bins @xmath51 . at a fixed energy , the mean value of @xmath52 is 2/3 for comparison .",
    "= 1.0    = 1.0    figure [ fig : kappa ] shows that an isotropic nfw halo has more low - eccentricity orbits at fixed radius than an isotropic core halo .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "the density at a given radius in a halo is contributed by particles on different orbits . in the inner region of a halo , orbits with lower energies",
    "are more circular , while those with higher energies are more radial . assuming isotropic velocity dispersion , one can show that the energy distribution is flatter in a core halo than in a cuspy halo .",
    "consequently , for isotropic velocity distribution a core halo requires more high - eccentricity orbits than an nfw halo .",
    "we study the accuracy of the circular - orbit adiabatic approximation @xcite in predicting halo contraction due to disk formation and provide a physical explanation for the deserved trends .",
    "we consider : ( 1 ) variation in the accretion time scale ; ( 2 ) variation in the accreted disk mass ; ( 3 ) variation in the central concentration of both cuspy and core halo models ; and ( 4 ) variation in the velocity isotropy .",
    "the circular orbit adiabatic contraction approximation is acceptable over a wide range of astronomically interesting parameters .",
    "the relative change in the rotation curve value between the simulation and circular orbit approximation at 2.2 disk scale lengths , @xmath53 , is less than 23% for our entire range of realistic parameters .",
    "we find that the disk growth is still slower than dark matter halo dynamical time in the vicinity of the disk and therefore the adiabatic approximation is maintained .",
    "the value of @xmath53 depends only weakly on the fraction of accreted baryon mass , and therefore , the dependence on halo concentration can not be explained by disk dominance in less concentrated halos .",
    "however , @xmath53 is strongly correlated with the fraction of eccentric orbits in the distribution .",
    "the steeper the cusp , the larger fraction of more circular orbits are required at _ fixed _ radius , and this supports the circular orbit approximation .",
    "although the adiabatic concentration approximation overestimates the response of dark matter halos , as long as the dark matter halo has central cusp and isotropic velocity distribution the overestimation is negligible .",
    "our results have important implications for the formation of disk galaxies in the cdm scenario . in comparing theory with the observed tully - fisher relation",
    ", one usually uses the peak rotation velocity of galaxy disks to represent the observed rotation velocities @xcite .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , if dark matter halos respond to the disk growth according to the adiabatic contraction model , current cdm model predicts a tully - fisher relation that has a much too low zero - point ( i.e. galaxies are too faint for a given peak rotation velocity ) . in order to match the observed tully - fisher zero - point ,",
    "one has to assume that disk growth does not cause any contraction in dark matter halos at all ( * ? ? ?",
    "this assumption is not supported by our results , which show that adiabatic contraction approximation works reasonably well for cdm halos over a wide range of situations .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that there are other astrophysical processes , such as mergers @xcite , dynamical heating by substructures @xcite , halo pre - processing @xcite , and resonance dynamics @xcite , that may modify halo structures but are not included in the models considered here .",
    "unfortunately , the importance of these processes are not well understood at the present .",
