    "a stochastic background of gravitational waves is expected to be very weak among various types of gravitational - wave signals .",
    "such a tiny signal is produced by an incoherent superposition of many gravitational - wave signals coming from the irresolvable astrophysical objects and/or diffuse high - energy sources in the early universe .",
    "up to now , various mechanisms to produce stochastic signals have been proposed and their amplitudes and spectra are estimated quantitatively ( for the review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    despite the small amplitude of the signals ,",
    "the stochastic backgrounds of gravitational waves contain valuable cosmological information about cosmic expansion history and astrophysical phenomena .",
    "because of its weak interaction , the extremely early stage of the universe beyond the last scattering surface of the electromagnetic waves would be probed via the direct detection of inflationary gravitational - waves background . in this sense ,",
    "gravitational - wave backgrounds are an ultimate cosmological tool and the direct detection of such signals will open a new subject of cosmology .    as a trade - off , detection of stochastic background is very difficult and the challenging problem .",
    "recently , the observational bound of stochastic background has been updated by laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo @xcite ) third scientific run @xcite and the amplitude of signal is constrained to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the energy density of gravitational wave divided by the critical energy density . while this is the most stringent constraint obtained from the laser interferometer @xcite , this bound is still larger than the limit inferred from the big - bang nucleosynthesis . hence , for the direct detection of stochastic signals , a further development to increase the sensitivity is essential . to do this ,",
    "one obvious approach is to construct a more sophisticated detector whose sensitivity level is only limited by the quantum noises .",
    "next - generation of ground - based detectors , such as ligo ii and large - scale cryogenic gravitational - wave telescope ( lcgt ) @xcite , will greatly improve the sensitivity that reaches or may beat the standard quantum limit .",
    "furthermore , the space - based interferometer will be suited to prove gravitational wave backgrounds due to its lower observational band  @xcite .",
    "another important direction is to explore the efficient and the robust technique of data analysis for signal detection .    in this paper",
    ", we shall treat the latter issue , particularly focusing on the signal detection in the presence of the non - gaussian noises .",
    "when we search for the weak stochastic signals embedded in the detector noise , we have no practical way to discriminate between the detector noise and a stochastic signal by using only a single detector .",
    "to detect a stochastic signal , we must combine the two outputs at different detectors and quantify the statistical correlation between them .",
    "this cross - correlation technique is the robust statistical method that is still useful in the cases with large detector noises .",
    "the so - called standard cross correlation technique has been frequently used in the data analysis of laser interferometers . note that the standard cross correlation statistic was derived under the assumption that both the signals and the instrumental noises obey stationary gaussian process @xcite . in practice , however , gravitational wave detectors do not have a pure gaussian noise .",
    "because of some uncontrolled mechanisms , most experiments exhibit a non - gaussian tail . in the presence of non - gaussianity",
    ", the direct application of the standard cross - correlation statistic significantly degrades the sensitivity of signal detection . a more appropriate cross - correlation statistic to reduce",
    "the influence of the non - gaussian tails should be desirable in the data analysis of signal detection .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the standard cross - correlation analysis was extended to deal with more realistic situation .",
    "they found that such a modified statistic shows a better performance compared to the standard cross - correlation statistic @xcite .",
    "this modified statistic is called the locally optimal statistic @xcite . roughly speaking , the usual standard cross - correlation statistic uses all detector samples , while the locally optimal statistic excludes the samples of the non - gaussian tails outside the main gaussian part from the detector samples . as a result ,",
    "the statistical noise variance in the locally optimal statistic becomes small due to the truncation of the samples of the non - gaussian tail , so that the effective signal - to - noise ratio becomes large .    in this paper",
    ", we derive analytical formulas for the false - alarm and the false - dismissal probabilities and the minimum detectable signal amplitude to quantify the performance of the locally optimal statistic .",
    "then , we demonstrate the detection efficiency of locally optimal statistic in a simple non - gaussian noise model , in which the probability distribution of the instrumental noise is described by the two - component gaussian noise . based on the analytical formulas , the efficiency of the locally optimal statistic is quantified compared to the standard cross - correlation statistic .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review the detection strategy for a stochastic background .",
    "we then introduce the generalized cross - correlation statistic which is nearly optimal in the presence of non - gaussian noise . in sec.[sec:3",
    "] , particularly focusing on the two - component gaussian model as a simple model of non - gaussian noises , we analytically estimate the false - alarm and the false - dismissal probabilities . based on this",
    ", we obtain the analytic expression for the minimum detectable amplitude of stochastic signals .",
    "the resultant analytic formulas imply that the detection efficiency of the gcc statistic roughly corresponds to the one of the scc statistics neglecting the contribution of non - gaussian tails .",
    "these remarkable properties are checked and confirmed by performing the monte carlo simulations in sec.[sec:4 ] . finally , in sec.[sec:5 ] , we close the paper with a summary of results and a discussion of future prospects .",
    "as we previously mentioned , the gravitational - wave background ( gwb ) signal is expected to be very week and is usually masked by the detector noises .",
    "to detect such tiny signals , it is practically impossible to detect the gwb signal from the single - detector measurement .",
    "thus , we cross - correlate the two outputs obtained from the different detectors and seek a common signal .",
    "we denote the detector outputs by @xmath2 with @xmath3 where @xmath4 labels the two detectors , and @xmath5 is a time index . here",
    ", @xmath6 is the gravitational - wave signal , whose amplitude is typically @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the noise in each detector . the @xmath9 output matrix @xmath10 is made up of these outputs . throughout this paper , we discuss the optimal detection method under the assumption of weak signal , i.e. , @xmath11 .      to judge whether a gravitational signal is indeed present in detector outputs or not , the simplest approach is to use a detection statistic @xmath12 .",
    "when @xmath13 exceeds a threshold @xmath14 , we think that the signal is detected , and not detected otherwise .",
    "the statistic @xmath15 , which is made up of random variables @xmath10 , exhibits random nature under the finite sampling and because of this , we have two types of error depending on the detection criterion @xmath14 .",
    "the probabilities of these errors are often called _ false - alarm rate _ and _ false - dismissal rate_. the probability of the false alarm is the one that we conclude to have detected a signal , but the signal is in fact absent .",
    "we denote the probability by @xmath16 $ ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the probability of the false dismissal which we denote by @xmath17 $ ] is the probability that we fail to detect a signal even though the signal is in fact present .",
    "thus , one may say that the detection statistic is _ optimal _ only when the two errors are minimized .",
    "neyman and pearson showed that the likelihood ratio is the optimal decision statistic that minimizes @xmath18 for a given value of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the likelihood ratio is given by @xmath20 here , the quantity @xmath21 is the probability distribution function of the observational data set @xmath10 in the presence of the signal , whose amplitude is given by @xmath7 . we are specifically concerned with the detection of weak signals . in such a situation , regarding @xmath7 as a small parameter , one can expand @xmath15 as @xmath22 as long as @xmath7 is small , the higher - order terms of @xmath23 are neglected and the quantity @xmath24 approximately becomes the optimal decision statistic .",
    "this statistic is called the _ locally optimal statistic _ @xcite .",
    "if @xmath24 becomes zero , then @xmath25 is the optimal decision statistic .      in order to obtain some insights into the locally optimal statistic",
    ", we consider the simplest situation for the data analysis of signal detection .",
    "for any two detectors , we assume that their orientations are coincident and coaligned without any systematic noise correlation between them , so that two detectors receive the same signal , i.e. , @xmath26 .",
    "there are several missions that realize such a situation .",
    "the ongoing ligo project has two colocated detectors in the hanford site , although the arm length of each detector is different @xcite .",
    "the lcgt detector proposed by the japanese group also has two colocated detector sharing a common arm cavity @xcite .",
    "in addition to the orientation of the detectors , we further assume that each detector has a white and stationary noise . in this case , the joint probability distribution of the detector noises is given by @xmath27 where the symbol @xmath28 represents the noise contribution to the output matrix @xmath10 .",
    "note that eq.([npdf0 ] ) reduces to a multivariate gaussian distribution if the function @xmath29 becomes quadratic in its argument .",
    "thus , the function @xmath29 other than the quadratic form implies the non - gaussianity of the detector noises . as for the probability of the signal amplitude",
    ", we also assume that the signal is white , so that the probability distribution function for @xmath30 is expressed by @xmath31 from eqs .",
    "( [ output ] ) , ( [ npdf0 ] ) and ( [ spdf0 ] ) , the numerator in the likelihood ratio ( [ likelihood ] ) is given by @xmath32 expanding the likelihood ratio with respect to @xmath33 around zero , we obtain the locally optimal statistic @xcite . in the present case , @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ expansion ] ) , which includes the linear term of the signal , vanishes because the stochastic gravitational wave is usually a zero - mean signal .",
    "therefore , @xmath25 turns out to be the optimal _",
    "decision statistic_. @xmath25 is composed of second derivative terms and some quadratic of the first derivative terms with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "we then classify these terms into _ single - detector _",
    "statistic and _ two - detector _",
    "statistic @xcite . the former statistic , which is described by quantities such as @xmath34 and @xmath35 ,",
    "are only relevant in the cases when the gravitational - wave signal dominates the detector noises .",
    "the latter two - detector statistic is given by @xcite @xmath36 where we used the fact that the signal is white .",
    "in this paper , we especially call it generalized cross - correlation ( gcc ) statistic .    in what follows , for the purpose of our analytic study , we treat the non - gaussian parameters in the function @xmath37 as known parameter .",
    "furthermore , we define the counterpart of the gcc statistic in the absence of non - gaussianity as : @xmath38 which we call the standard cross - correlation ( scc ) statistic . strictly speaking , the decision statistics derived here are not the optimal decision statistics @xcite . for instance , in the case of the gaussian noises with unknown variances , the optimal decision statistic differs from eq .",
    "( [ scc ] ) by a factor @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the square - root of the autocorrelation function for the output signals @xmath41 , i.e. , @xmath42 .",
    "nevertheless , in the large - sample limit @xmath43 , statistical fluctuations in the autocorrelation function become negligible relative to those in @xmath44 and the autocorrelation functions can be treated as constants .",
    "thus , in the limit @xmath43 , the factor @xmath39 is irrelevant and one can identify eq .",

    "we hope that the resultant analytic formulas for detection efficiency are also useful in the practical situation that we do not know the noise parameters _ a priori_.",
