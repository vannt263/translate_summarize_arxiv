    "in recent years meson production has been extensively studied in the context of understanding of the strong interaction in the non  perturbative energy domain of the quantum chromodynamics , where it is not obvious whether hadronic or quark - gluon degrees of freedom are more appropriate for the description of the dynamics and interaction of hadrons . for the @xmath3 meson precise data  @xcite of the total cross section of the @xmath1 reaction allowed one to conclude that the reaction proceeds predominantly through the excitation of one of the protons to the @xmath4 state which subsequently de - excites via emission of the @xmath3 meson .",
    "the crucial observations were a large value of the absolute cross section ( about forty times larger than for the @xmath5 meson  @xcite ) and isotropic angular distributions  @xcite of the @xmath3 meson emission in the reaction center - of - mass system .",
    "however , due to the negligible variation of the production amplitude in the range of few tens of mev the full information available from the excitation function is reduced to a single number  @xcite .",
    "consequently , measurements of one reaction channel are not sufficient to establish contributions from different production currents ( e.g. mesonic , nucleonic , resonance or gluonic  @xcite ) . for this purpose ,",
    "an exploration of isospin and spin degrees of freedom is mandatory .",
    "the first measurement of the dependence of the @xmath3 production on the isospin of the interacting nucleons was conducted by the wasa / promice collaboration  @xcite in the excess energy range from 16  mev to 109  mev . on the hadronic level ,",
    "the observed strong isospin dependence indicated a dominant contribution to the production process from the isovector meson exchange .",
    "further comparison of predictions involving exchanges of various mesons  @xcite with recent results on the analysing power  @xcite signified the dominance of the @xmath6 meson exchange in the production process ( though with a rather low statistical significance )  @xcite .",
    "this observation is in line with predictions of nakayama et al .",
    "@xcite and with calculations of shyam  @xcite .",
    "yet , it seems to be contra - intuitive due to the very large momentum transfer between the interacting nucleons needed to create the @xmath3 meson near threshold which should rather favor exchanges of heavier mesons ( e.g. @xmath7 ) as anticipated by authors of references  @xcite .",
    "moreover , with the high momentum transfer a direct role of quarks and gluons in the production process is also conceivable .",
    "according to the heisenberg uncertainty relation the distance probed by the @xmath8 reactions at threshold is expected to be about 0.26  fm .",
    "geometrical considerations presented by maltman and isgur  @xcite indicate that at distances smaller than @xmath9 the inter - nucleon potential should begin to be free of meson exchange effects and may be dominated by residual colour forces  @xcite .",
    "in particular , since the singlet components of the @xmath3 and @xmath10 mesons couple to glue , it is natural to consider a mechanism where glue is excited in the `` short distance '' ( @xmath11  fm ) interaction region of a proton - nucleon collision and then evolves to become an @xmath3 or @xmath10 in the final state . such gluonic induced production , proposed by bass  @xcite , is extra to the contributions associated with meson exchange models , and appears as a contact term in the axial u(1 ) extended chiral lagrangian for low - energy qcd .    in order to verify the different production mechanisms it is of crucial importance to provide an empirical base with spin and isospin dependence of the cross sections of the near threshold meson production in the collision of nucleons as well as in the photo - production processes .",
    "therefore , such investigations are conducted at several experimental facilities  @xcite . in this article",
    "we report on the measurement which enables us for the first time to determine cross sections for the @xmath0 reaction close to the kinematical threshold where a contribution from only a single partial wave is expected .",

    "it is quite probable that the beam proton interacts with the nucleon from the deuteron as if it would be a free particle .",
    "such quasi - free proton - neutron interactions were tagged by the registration of the low energy proton moving upstream the beam . in the analysis the proton emerging from the deuteron is considered as a spectator which leaves the interaction region with the fermi momentum undisturbed by the final state interaction with the other reaction products . in this approach",
    "we assume that the measured spectator proton was on its mass shell already at the collision moment and that the matrix element for the production of the @xmath3 meson by the beam proton off the neutron bound in the deuteron is identical to that for the free @xmath0 reaction .",
    "this assumption is supported by a theoretical investigation  @xcite and was already confirmed by various experiments  @xcite . in particular it was proven that even in the case of the pion production it is valid up to a fermi momentum of 150 mev / c  @xcite .",
    "the fermi motion of nucleons causes the smearing of the total center - of - mass energy for the proton - neutron reaction ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the resultant distribution of the excess energy for the quasi - free @xmath0 reaction ( q  @xmath20  @xmath21 ) is broader than 50  mev  @xcite , and therefore to achieve an accuracy of q in the order of a few mev it is important to reconstruct the four - momentum vector of the interacting neutron on the event - by - event basis .",
    "such an accuracy is mandatory for near threshold studies where the cross sections may vary by more than an order of magnitude within an excess energy range of a few tens of mev  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the spectator proton was registered not only to tag the quasi free proton - neutron reaction but also to determine the four - momentum vector of the reacting neutron .",
    "the usage of the thin cluster target ( 10@xmath16 atoms/@xmath17 ) and mounting of the spectator detector inside the beam pipe ensured the negligible distortion of the momentum of the measured spectators .",
    "based on the aforementioned spectator model and on the energy and momentum conservation , the four momentum of the target neutron @xmath22 at the moment of the collision was derived from the measured spectator four momentum @xmath23 according to the following formulae : @xmath24 ,  and   @xmath25 , [ sekowa ] where @xmath26 denotes the mass of the deuteron .",
    "the absolute momentum of the beam proton was determined based on the known beam optics and the frequency measurement of the circulating beam  @xcite .",
    "the outgoing proton from the @xmath27 reaction was separated from the beam in the magnetic field of the dipole and it was identified by the independent measurement of its momentum and velocity using drift chambers and scintillators .",
    "the momentum of outgoing proton was reconstructed with a precision of 6  mev / c ( standard deviation )  @xcite by tracing its trajectory in the magnetic field of the dipole back to the interaction point .",
    "the outgoing neutron was measured by means of the neutral particle detector , which delivered information about the position and time at which the registered neutron induced a hadronic reaction .",
    "finally , the @xmath3 meson was identified via the missing mass technique , where the four - momentum of an unobserved object produced in the quasi - free @xmath28 reaction was determined as : @xmath29 .",
    "the evaluation of the four - momentum vectors of the outgoing neutron and the spectator proton as well as the functioning of detectors used for their registration will be described more detailed in the following sections .",
