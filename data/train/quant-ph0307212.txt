    "bell - state measurement ( bsm ) - distinguishing between the four maximally - entangled bell states - is required in many quantum information schemes , including quantum dense coding @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite and entanglement swapping @xcite .",
    "however , it has been proven that a complete bsm ( distinguishing between the four states with 100% efficiency ) is impossible using only linear operations and classical communication @xcite .",
    "in fact , ghosh _ et .",
    "_ @xcite have proven that , if only a single copy is provided , the best one can do is discriminate between two bell states .",
    "calsamiglia and ltkenhaus @xcite have shown that the maximum efficiency for a linear bell - state analyzer is @xmath0 .    a favorable characteristic of the photon as a carrier of quantum information is the relative ease with which entangled photons can be created and transported .",
    "two - photon bell states are easily generated using spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) in one of several degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "there are several methods for optical bell - state measurement that allow one to distinguish two @xcite of the four bell - states states ( resulting in 3 classes of states ) .",
    "all of these methods use local or non - local two - photon interference effects at beam splitters .",
    "for example , mattle _ et .",
    "@xcite have performed an experimental demonstration of dense coding , in which the bell - states were created in the polarization degrees of freedom of the two photons .",
    "when the photons meet at a common beam splitter , the overall bosonic symmetry of the two - photon state requires that photons in the antisymmetric singlet state exit in different output ports , while the symmetric triplet states end up in the same output port @xcite .",
    "polarization analyzers are then used to further discriminate among the triplet states .",
    "weinfurter has proposed a bsm method using momentum - entangled photons that allows one to distinguish all four bell - states with @xmath1 efficiency @xcite .",
    "it is possible to distinguish among the four bell states using nonlinear optical processes @xcite , however , with present technology these methods suffer from low efficiency .",
    "there have also been several proposals using two - photon absorption @xcite .    in recent years , some attention has been paid to bell - state analysis using hyperentangled states @xcite . utilizing entanglement in additional auxiliary degrees of freedom ,",
    "it is possible to perform a complete bsm . due to the enlarged hilbert space ,",
    "this type of complete bsm is not restricted to the efficiency limits presented in @xcite .",
    "kwiat and weinfurter @xcite have proposed a scheme using photons entangled in polarization and momentum ( spatial mode ) .",
    "their method , which relies on linear optics and two - photon interference effects , requires detectors that distinguish between one- and two - photon detection events .",
    "we showed that this requirement on the detectors could be removed if the hyperentangled photons were created by spdc using a hermite - gaussian pump beam @xcite .",
    "the hermite - gaussian beam used is an odd function of the horizontal transverse spatial coordinate , which inverts the two - photon interference behavior @xcite , allowing for identification of all four bell - states in coincidence detections .",
    "here we present a new method for complete bell - state analysis using hyperentangled states .",
    "this scheme differs from others in that it ( _ i _ ) does not rely on two - photon interference , ( _ ii _ ) does not require detectors sensitive to photon number , and ( _ iii _ ) can be implemented non - locally with 2 bits of additional classical communication . in section [ sec : hyper ] we briefly discuss the creation of hyperentangled states .",
    "we present our hyperentangled bell - state analyzer in section [ sec : hbsa ] , and discuss the application of these results to quantum information protocol such as dense coding and teleportation .",
    "hyperentangled states can be generated using the type - i two - crystal source @xcite . selecting two sets of regions ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) gives photon pairs entangled in momentum and polarization.,width=264 ]    we will work with hyperentangled two - photon states of the form @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 are the four dimensional vectors representing the polarization and momentum degrees of freedom of the two photons , respectively . in the basis defined by linear horizontal ( @xmath7 ) and linear vertical ( @xmath8 ) polarization , the polarization - entangled bell - states are :    [ eq:1 ] @xmath9    where @xmath10 stand for the polarization state of the photon @xmath11 .",
    "likewise , the momentum - entangled bell - states are :    [ eq:2 ] @xmath12    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 represent different spatial modes of photon @xmath11 .",
    "we note here that polarization states have been denoted with uppercase letters and momentum states with lowercase letters .    for our hyperentangled - bell - state analysis we will consider states of the form @xmath15 , where @xmath5 is one of the polarization bell states ( [ eq:1 ] ) , though one could use any of the states ( [ eq:2 ] ) with similar results .",
    "recently , it was shown that this type of hyperentangled two - photon state could be used to violate a generalized form of the greenberger - horne - zeilinger theorem @xcite , and may be useful in creating decoherence - free subspaces @xcite .",
    "these states can be generated by means of spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) in several ways @xcite .",
    "for example , the type - i two - crystal source @xcite emits polarization - entangled photons of the same wavelength around the rim of a cone ( fig .",
    "[ fig : source ] ) . in this source ,",
    "crystal 1 emits pairs of ( say ) @xmath7-polarized photons and crystal 2 emits pairs of @xmath8-polarized photons in superimposed emission cones .",
    "phase - matching conditions guarantee that photon pairs are emitted on opposite sides of the cone .",
    "if the two - crystal interaction region lies entirely within a coherence volume of the pump laser beam , a polarization- and momentum - entangled state of the form @xmath16 can be selected by the two sets of regions @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "one can adjust the phase so that the momentum state is @xmath17 .",
    "half- and quarter - wave plates can be used to switch between the four polarization bell - states @xcite .",
    "the hyperentangled bell - state analyzer .",
    "the pbs are polarizing beam splitters in the @xmath18 basis .",
    "hwp are half - wave plates .",
    "the cnot  operation uses the polarization as the control and momentum as the target .",
    "the pa are polarization analyzers in the @xmath19 basis ( denoted as @xmath20 ) consisting of a hwp and a pbs.,width=264 ]    the hyperentangled - bell - state analyzer is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bsa_hyp ] .",
    "the hyperentangled state @xmath15 is first incident on a set of polarizing - beam splitters ( pbs ) , which reflect @xmath7-polarized photons and transmit @xmath8-polarized photons .",
    "the pbs perform a controlled - not ( cnot ) logic operation between the polarization ( control ) and spatial ( target ) degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "if the polarization is @xmath8 then the photon is transmitted , and switches modes . if the polarization is @xmath7 , then the photon is reflected , and remains in the same mode .",
    "the complete pbs operation on the polarization and spatial mode of photon @xmath11 is @xmath21 it is straightforward to show that the four states @xmath15 transform as @xmath22 a quick look at ( [ eq:4 ] ) shows that the pbs s mark the momentum state by performing a polarization - controlled logic operation .",
    "the momentum state can then be used to discriminate between the @xmath23 and @xmath24 polarization states : coincidence detections in modes @xmath25 or @xmath26 imply states @xmath23 while coincidences in @xmath2 or @xmath27 imply states @xmath24 . using additional polarization analyzers ( pa in fig .",
    "[ fig : bsa_hyp ] ) orientated at @xmath28 , we can discriminate between the respective @xmath20 states .",
    "specifically , @xmath29 and @xmath30 give coincidence counts at the @xmath31 or @xmath32 output ports while @xmath33 and @xmath34 give coincidence counts at the @xmath35 or @xmath36 output ports .",
    "a summary of the detector signatures for the polarization bell states are shown in table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "we note that all four bell - states are recognized in the coincidence basis , with no need for detectors that are sensitive to photon number , and without the use of two - photon interference effects .",
    "furthermore , the bsm can be performed non - locally at the cost of 2 bits of classical communication , since the physicist measuring system @xmath37 needs to communicate one of four possible outcomes to system @xmath38 ( or vice versa ) .",
    ".[tab:1 ] detector signatures for polarization bell - states using the momentum state @xmath17 as an ancilla .  @xmath39 \" @xmath40 and  @xmath41\"@xmath42 . [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we now discuss the possible application of hyperentangled bell - state analysis to quantum information protocol .",
    "the quantum dense coding protocol @xcite allows for the transmission of two bits of information in one quantum bit .",
    "two parties , alice and bob , each possess one photon of an entangled bell - state ( @xmath43 , for example ) .",
    "since the reduced density matrix for bob s photon is @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the @xmath46 identity matrix , there is no information present in bob s photon alone .",
    "some time later , alice wishes to send a 2 bit message to bob .",
    "she switches among the four bell - states using local operations , and then sends her photon to bob , who performs a bell - state measurement on the photon pair , and retrieves alice s message .",
    "since there was no information present in bob s photon , then the 2 bits of information present was sent in alice s photon .",
    "however , the reduced density matrix of alice s photon is also @xmath44 , so an eavesdropper could not extract any information from alice s photon alone .",
    "an appealing feature of the hyperentangled product states @xmath16 is that the two degrees of freedom can be manipulated independently .",
    "for example , one can switch among the polarization bell states using local operations ( quarter- and half - wave plates in modes @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) on the polarization state , while leaving the momentum state untouched .",
    "one could then implement a dense - coding scheme in which information is encoded in the polarization state , while the momentum state remains as an ancilla to assist in the complete bell - state measurement .",
    "we note that this implementation requires 4 qubits ( encoded in 2 photons ) to transmit 2 classical bits of information and thus it may be debatable as to whether this is actually  dense \" coding .",
    "however , since the density matrix of ( say ) photon 2 is @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the total @xmath51 density matrix of photons 1 and 2 and @xmath52 is the @xmath53 identity matrix , we can still send 2 classical bits of information in one photon ( containing 2 qubits ) in such a way that an eavesdropper with access to only this photon can not extract any information .",
    "another use of a bell - state measurement is in the quantum teleportation protocol @xcite , which can be used to swap entanglement @xcite and perform quantum logic operations for quantum computation @xcite . in quantum teleportation , two spatially separate parties alice and bob each are in possession of one photon of an entangled pair , prepared in a bell - state .",
    "one of them , say alice , wants to teleport the quantum state of a third photon to bob . of course",
    ", alice does not know what state she is teleporting , or else she could simply call bob on the telephone and tell him to prepare that state . instead , alice performs a bell - state measurement on her two photons .",
    "she then communicates classically to bob , telling him the results of her bsm , at which point bob , performs a local operation and recovers the state of the third photon , now encoded in his photon . in this way",
    "alice can teleport a quantum state to bob without actually knowing what state she is sending .    to date ,",
    "quantum teleportation implementations @xcite can be performed with a bell - state measurement that is 50% efficient using two - photon interference , polarization analysis and single photon detectors .",
    "given an unknown quantum state , alice , who shares a pair of maximally entangled photons with bob , can teleport this state to him with 50% efficiency .",
    "suppose alice and bob share a pair of polarization - entangled photons in the bell - state @xmath54 and alice would like to teleport the unknown polarization state @xmath55 of photon 3 . to take advantage of hyperentangled bell - state analysis",
    ", alice would need to entangle the momentum degree of freedom of photon 2 with that of photon 3 .",
    "to do so requires a controlled logic operation between the two photons , such as a cnot  gate .",
    "but if she could perform an efficient two - photon cnot  operation then she might as well use it to perform her bsm , which can be done with the same efficiency using a cnot   gate and a single photon hadamard rotation @xcite .",
    "one might think that alice could first entangle the momentum degrees of freedom of photons 2 and 3 using an inefficient cnot  gate , and discard the cases where the gate did not give the desired output ( which is usually checked by measuring the ancillary modes ) .",
    "she could then pass photon 3 on to a friend who performs some sort of complex quantum computation using the polarization as a qubit , and then passes it back to alice for teleportation .",
    "the complex quantum computation , which we assume to be much more difficult and time consuming than the teleportation protocol , need be performed only once , since the bell - state measurement on photons 2 and 3 is now @xmath56 efficient . however , since photon 3 is part of an entangled momentum state , it is now defined by 2 spatial modes .",
    "so alice s friend is required to run the computation on both spatial modes , which in principle is the same as running the computation twice , as is required on average in the @xmath0 efficient teleportation scheme .",
    "thus , a teleportation protocol using bell - state measurement of hyperentangled states of this form does not present any gain over previous methods .",
    "we have shown a simple method for complete bell - state analysis using hyperentangled photons .",
    "our scheme requires only linear optics and single photon detectors , can be implemented non - locally with 2 bits of classical communication , and is well within the bounds of current technology .",
    "we have briefly discussed the application of these results to the quantum teleportation protocol . given that our scheme requires photons entangled in multiple degrees of freedom",
    ", it does not provide any increase in efficiency to bell - state measurements for quantum teleportation .",
    "however , our method can be applied directly to implementations of quantum dense coding , resulting in the secure transmission of 2 bits of classical information in one photon ( containing 2 qubits ) ."
