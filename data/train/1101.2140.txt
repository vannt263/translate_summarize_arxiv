    "in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) all soft susy breaking mass terms are treated as free parameters , to be fixed at the electro - weak scale .",
    "however , these soft parameters potentially contain a wealth of information about physics at the high scale and understanding the nature of susy breaking will become the main challenge , if signals of susy are found at the lhc .",
    "highly precise mass measurements will be needed to distinguish between different susy breaking schemes such as `` minimal supergravity '' ( msugra ) @xcite , anomaly mediated susy breaking ( amsb ) @xcite or gauge mediated susy breaking ( gmsb ) @xcite , to name just the most familiar ones .",
    "however , all of the models mentioned above break susy at energies inaccessible for collider experiments .",
    "thus , theoretical extrapolations from the tev scale to the high energy scale will be needed and any `` test '' of susy breaking schemes can at best take the form of a consistency check . based on the results of @xcite detailed calculations have been done , quantifying the accuracy with which such tests can be done using data from lhc and a possible ilc @xcite . however , these works concentrated on models with mssm particle content and thus did not attempt to take into account the observed non - zero neutrino masses . in this paper",
    "we study the prospects for the lhc and for a combined lhc+ilc analysis for finding indirect hints for the presence of a high - scale seesaw mechanism in susy spectra .",
    "the mssm assumes that r - parity is conserved and thus , just as in the standard model , neutrino masses vanish .",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite , however , have shown that at least two neutrino masses are non - zero @xcite . among the myriad of possible models of neutrino masses , ``",
    "the seesaw '' mechanism @xcite is undoubtedly the most popular one . the classical version of the seesaw @xcite introduces ( at least two ) fermionic singlets ( `` right - handed neutrinos '' ) with some large , but arbitrary majorana mass @xmath3 .",
    "the smallness of the observed neutrino masses is then a straightforward consequence of @xmath4 being inversely proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "this variant of the seesaw is now usually called type - i seesaw .    at tree - level",
    "there are only three realizations of the seesaw mechanism @xcite .",
    "in addition to type - i , the seesaw can be generated by the exchange of a scalar triplet ( type - ii ) @xcite or by a fermionic triplet in the adjoint representation ( type - iii ) @xcite .",
    "common to all of them is that for @xmath5 ev , where @xmath6 is the atmospheric neutrino mass splitting , and couplings of order @xmath7 the scale of the seesaw is estimated to be very roughly @xmath8 gev .",
    "extending the standard model ( sm ) with a seesaw mechanism leaves no experimental signal apart from the neutrino masses themselves .",
    "the situation is different in the supersymmetric seesaw .",
    "there are two kind of measurements which potentially can give indirect information about the seesaw parameters : lepton flavour violating ( lfv ) decays and superpartner mass measurements .",
    "the literature on lfv in susy seesaw is vast @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out already in @xcite that lfv is practically unavoidable in susy seesaw , even if the susy breaking boundary conditions are completely flavour blind . however , for ( 3 generation ) type - i and type - iii seesaws the seesaw mechanism has more free parameters than there are observables in the neutral and charged lepton sectors .",
    "the three lfv entries in the left slepton mass matrix can then be made arbitrarily small ( or large ) independent from any neutrino physics and thus there are no definite predictions for lfv decays in susy seesaw .",
    "indeed , if any charged lfv is ever observed one would probably turn the argument around and try to learn indirectly about the unknown seesaw parameters instead @xcite .",
    "in contrast , there are only very few papers , which have studied the impact of the seesaw on susy particle masses . some aspects of type - i seesaw have been studied focusing on what can be learned from precision measurements in the slepton sector @xcite . moreover , in such a scenario a splitting between the masses of the selectrons and smuons can occur which might be measurable at the lhc @xcite .",
    "changes in susy spectra can lead to changes in the expected relic density for the cold dark matter .",
    "the impact of large values of soft terms in the sneutrino sector @xcite and of large values for the trilinear @xmath9 parameter @xcite have been studied in this context .    the relative scarcity of publications on susy spectra and the seesaw is probably explained by the fact that type - i seesaw , the undoubtedly most popular variant , adds only singlets to the mssm particle content . if the yukawa couplings of these singlets are smaller than , say , the gauge couplings any effects of the right - handed neutrinos on the susy mass eigenvalues become negligibly small .",
    "this leaves only a rather small window for the seesaw scale , @xmath10 , say , roughly [ @xmath11 gev where any measurable shifts in susy masses can be expected at all . and it is , of course , exactly this range for @xmath10 where the largest values for lfv decays are expected .",
    "exceptions from this general rule can be found in models where one departs from the universality assumption of the msugra parameters with huge soft susy breaking parameters in the seesaw sector one gets larger effects @xcite , in particular in the higgs sector @xcite .",
    "changes in susy spectra with respect to , say , msugra expectations are expected to be much larger in type - ii and type - iii seesaws , but very little work has been done on these seesaw variants as well .",
    "type - ii and dm has been studied in @xcite , while for a study of the type - iii seesaw with emphasis on spectra and lfv see @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was pointed out , that one can form different combinations of soft susy breaking parameters , which at 1-loop order do not depend on the msugra parameters .",
    "consistent departures of these `` invariants '' from msugra expectations could then be taken as indirect hints of the seesaw .",
    "( see , however , @xcite for the importance of 2-loop effects on the `` invariants '' . )",
    "the above papers @xcite have pointed out , how type - ii and type - iii leave traces in susy spectra , in principle .",
    "they did not , however , attempt to _ quantify the accuracies _ needed to find hints of the seesaw in experimental mass measurements .",
    "to our knowledge the current paper is the first step in this direction .",
    "here we calculate the low - energy susy spectra for type - ii and type - iii seesaw in msugra and confront our theoretical results with expectations for the accuracy of susy mass measurements at the lhc and at a possible combined lhc+ilc analysis @xcite . given the estimated errors on susy masses obtained in detailed simulations @xcite we calculate expected @xmath12-distributions for the two different seesaw models , in order to give a theoretical forecast on the expected errors on the model parameters , most notably the error on the `` determination '' of the seesaw scale @xmath10 .",
    "our main results are the following : with the highly accurate mass measurements expected for the ilc it should be possible to distinguish between pure msugra ( i.e. a model with no seesaw at all ) and msugra plus type - ii or type - iii seesaw for almost _ any relevant value of @xmath10 _ , if at least some susy particles are within kinematical reach of the ilc .",
    "we find it noteworthy , however , that even with the much less accurate data , expected from lhc measurements only , it seems possible to distinguish pure msugra from the msugra plus seesaw models in some favorable parts of parameter space .",
    "obviously , all our results depend crucially on the - currently only theoretically estimated - errors , with which susy mass can be measured at lhc and ilc .",
    "we therefore discuss in some details what are the observables needed and the required error bars on these observables , before an analysis , such as the one presented here , can find any hints of the seesaw in susy spectra .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we summarize the three different variants of the seesaw , to set up the notation .",
    "we embed the new particles required by the different seesaw mechanisms in complete @xmath13 multiplets in order to maintain the successful unification of gauge couplings observed in the mssm .",
    "section 3 contains the bulk of this paper .",
    "it first defines our setup , lists the observables we use and then discusses susy spectra in the different models . with these results",
    "we then proceed to calculate theoretical @xmath12 distributions .",
    "we first discuss a combined lhc+ilc analysis and then go to the case of using only the less accurate lhc data .",
    "our results , of course , depend crucially on the accuracy with which the susy masses can be measured in future accelerator experiments .",
    "we therefore dedicate a subsection to discuss in detail the requirements for the accuracies on the most important observables needed for our analysis .",
    "we then close with a short discussion and outlook .",
    "in this section we briefly recall the main features of the three tree - level variants of the seesaw .",
    "a more detailed discussion including the embedding in @xmath13 can be found in @xcite . for brevity",
    ", we will discuss only the superpotential terms . in all cases ,",
    "we start with the mssm superpotential @xmath14 here , @xmath15 denotes the @xmath16 invariant product of two @xmath16 doublets and @xmath17 are ( @xmath18 ) yukawa coupling matrices , as usual . only for completeness",
    "we mention that a seesaw type - i is obtained by adding to the above superpotential : @xmath19 integrating out the heavy singlets , after electro - weak symmetry breaking , eq . ( [ eq : wtypei ] ) leads to the famous seesaw formula @xmath20 the atmospheric neutrino mass scale requires at least one neutrino to be heavier than @xmath21 ev . for yukawas of order @xmath7",
    "this results in a `` seesaw scale '' of roughly @xmath22 gev . since eq .",
    "( [ eq : wtypei ] ) only adds singlets to eq .",
    "( [ eq : wmssm ] ) one does in general not expect any sizeable changes in the supersymmetric mass spectra at the electro - weak scale , see also the discussion in the introduction and in @xcite . in section [ subsec :",
    "spec ] we will discuss , how the introduction of non - singlets changes the expected susy spectra and comment on the expected change for type - i .    in supersymmetric models the simplest way to generate a type - ii , while maintaining gauge coupling unification , is to add a pair of @xmath0-plets of @xmath13 to eq .",
    "( [ eq : wmssm ] ) .",
    "the @xmath13 invariant superpotential than reads @xmath23 here , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the usual @xmath13 matter multiplets and @xmath26 and @xmath27 . under @xmath28",
    "the @xmath0-plet decomposes as @xcite @xmath29 below the gut scale , @xmath30 , in the @xmath13-broken phase the superpotential reads @xmath31 where fields with index 1 ( 2 ) originate from the @xmath0-plet ( @xmath1-plet ) . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : broken ] ) is responsible for the generation of neutrino masses , which at low energies are given by @xmath32 similar to type - i , the seesaw scale is estimated to be @xmath33 .",
    "in the case of a seesaw model type - iii one needs new fermions @xmath34 at the high scale belonging to the adjoint representation of @xmath16 .",
    "the simplest complete @xmath13 embedding possible is the 24-plet @xcite .",
    "the superpotential of the unbroken @xmath13 is then @xmath35 the @xmath2 decomposes under @xmath28 as @xmath36 the @xmath37 has the same quantum numbers as the @xmath38 , while the fermionic component of the @xmath39 corresponds to the @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the @xmath2 always produces a combination of the type - i and type - iii seesaw .    in the @xmath13 broken phase the superpotential contains @xmath40 integrating out the heavy fields , as before , leads to @xmath41",
    "there are two contributions : ( i ) from the gauge singlet and ( ii ) from the @xmath16 triplet . starting with a common @xmath42 , @xmath43 evolves slightly differently from @xmath44 under the rges .",
    "in principle two non - zero neutrino masses are generated from one @xmath2 only .",
    "however , the ratio of the two non - zero neutrino masses generated in the rge running is much too tiny to explain the observed neutrino data and thus at least 2 copies of @xmath2 are needed for a realistic neutrino mass spectrum . in our numerical calculations we use 3 copies of @xmath2 , motivated by the observed 3 generations.with @xmath45",
    ", one can simplify eq .",
    "( [ eq : mnu_seesawiii ] ) to @xmath46 the scale of @xmath47 is then estimated to be @xmath48 gev for @xmath49 .",
    "in subsection [ subsec : setup ] we will define our setup and discuss the input observables . in [ subsec : spec ] we discuss the susy spectra in the different models and how the observables change under changes of the seesaw scale . section [ subsec : lhcandilc ] we present our results for a combined lhc+ilc analysis , while [ subsec : lhc ] shows the results for an analysis using only lhc data .",
    "section [ subsec : errors ] discusses the accuracies on the different observables , which need to be achieved experimentally , before any conclusions on the presence ( or absence ) of a seesaw mechanism can be drawn .",
    "given the inherent unreliability of theoretical error forecasts in general , section [ subsec : errors ] can be considered to contain the central parts of the current paper .",
    "all the numerical results shown in the following have been obtained with the programme package spheno @xcite .",
    "the rge equations , complete at the 2-loop order , have been calculated and incorporated into spheno with the help of sarah @xcite .",
    "details and discussion of the implementation can be found in @xcite .    to completely specify the low - energy susy spectra",
    ", we have to assume a specific susy breaking scenario .",
    "in this paper we use msugra .",
    "msugra is defined at the gut - scale , @xmath50 , by : a common gaugino mass @xmath51 , a common scalar mass @xmath52 and the trilinear coupling @xmath9 , which gets multiplied by the corresponding yukawa couplings to obtain the trilinear couplings in the soft susy breaking lagrangian .",
    "in addition , at the electro - weak scale , @xmath53 is fixed . here , as usual , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the neutral component of @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively . finally , the sign of the @xmath58 parameter has to be chosen .    in the following",
    "we will call `` pure msugra '' , pmsugra for short , the version of the model with no seesaw mechanism at all . note that this is equivalent to putting the seesaw scale @xmath10 equal to the gut scale @xmath50 . for brevity",
    ", we will call `` tpye - ii '' and `` type - iii '' models with msugra boundary conditions , to which on top of the mssm particle content the corresponding `` seesaw particles '' , as specified in the previous section , are added at scale @xmath10 .    in our numerical calculations we concentrate on some selected sets of msugra parameters .",
    "this is mainly motivated by the exorbitant amount of cpu time a full scan over the msugra space would require , see also the discussion below .",
    "the points we have studied are sps1a @xcite and the points sps1b and sps3 @xcite .",
    "in addition , for reasons explained in section [ subsec : spec ] , we consider a few more points with modified msugra parameters .",
    "we will call these points msp-1 ( @xmath59 ) = ( @xmath60 ) , msp-2 ( @xmath61 ) and msp-3 ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "msp-1 is similar to sps1a but with a larger value of @xmath51 , msp-2 is a point with larger @xmath63 and msp-3 is similar to sps3 , but again with a larger value of @xmath51 .",
    "all these points choose @xmath64 .",
    "we have not found any qualitatively new features in points with negative @xmath58 , as far as the determination of @xmath10 is concerned .",
    "observables and their theoretically forecasted errors are taken from the tables ( 5.13 ) and ( 5.14 ) of @xcite and from @xcite . for the lhc we take into account the `` edge variables '' : @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 from the decay chain @xmath70 and @xmath71 @xcite . in addition , we consider @xmath72 , @xmath73 ( from decays involving the lighter stau ) and the mass differences @xmath74 , with @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 . since @xmath78 and @xmath79 applies for a large range of the parameter space lhc measurements will not be able to distinguish between the first two generation sfermions .",
    "this allows us to define the masses @xmath80 and @xmath81 which will be used from now on for the mass differences @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "as discussed below in section [ subsec : errors ] , especially @xmath84 and the edge variables are important for the lhc analysis . for the ilc",
    "we assume that at least @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are kinematically accessible .",
    "in addition , whenever within the reach of the ilc , we also take into account @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , which are , however , less important .",
    "we also assume that the lighter higgs , @xmath92 , has been found and its mass measured with an accuracy which depends on whether the analysis is for lhc only or for lhc+ilc , see the corresponding error estimates in @xcite .",
    "errors for the ilc are taken directly from the tables of the above papers .",
    "for the error bars for the lhc , however , we have rescaled all statistical errors from the values for @xmath93 @xmath94 to a luminosity of ( only ) @xmath95 @xmath94 . to be conservative",
    "the total error is obtained summing statistic and systematic error linearly .",
    "note that we did not make use of the combined lhc and ilc errors calculated in the papers mentioned above .",
    "when we discuss the calculations for lhc and ilc observables in [ subsec : lhcandilc ] we refer to an analysis in which the lhc and ilc observables are all enabled but the errors are the errors for the lhc or ilc only .",
    "nevertheless , we have checked that using the combined errors changes the results only by an irrelevant amount .",
    "we will call this analysis therefore `` ilc+lhc combined '' .    in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "only standard sps points have been studied in detail . in the calculation of the @xmath12-distributions",
    "we assume that _ relative _ errors for different msugra points and/or seesaw points are constant .",
    "the assumption to use constant _ relative _ errors in all of our calculations is , of course , a crucial simplification which has to be checked very carefully .",
    "however , we have chosen to do so for the following two reasons : ( a ) it allows us to perform a @xmath12 analysis for all different spectra within reasonable cpu time . and ( b ) uncertainties of the theoretically forecasted error bars are nearly impossible to estimate .",
    "only experiments can finally determine total errors on observables .",
    "we thus use errors - as - predicted and discuss in section [ subsec : errors ] , how our conclusions will change as a function of these unknown errors .    to numerically estimate the allowed ranges for the model parameters we use a simple @xmath12 procedure .",
    "we have found that , see below , errors on @xmath52 , @xmath51 and @xmath10 are very strongly correlated . to assure that our estimates are reliable in all cases we have written two completely independent numerical codes .",
    "the first of these is based on minuit , . enforcing the @xmath10 scan while minuit is fitting the parameters @xmath52 , @xmath51 , tan@xmath96 and @xmath9 for fixed @xmath10 .",
    "the second code uses a straight - forward but slow monte carlo random walk procedure , which can be `` heated '' to find separated minima . in the mc calculations we use usually a ( few ) @xmath97 points to assure convergence .",
    "this makes the mc code slow , but reliable .",
    "we have done calculations using both codes in all cases necessary , to ensure that convergence has been reached .",
    "finally we need to mention that in all calculations shown below we put neutrino yukawa couplings to negligibly small values , unless noted otherwise . again",
    "the reason for this choice is simply to limit the amount of cpu time necessary for our fits .",
    "six more complex parameters .",
    "a full fit would require minimizing @xmath12 for 5 + 12 - 3=14 parameters , which can not done for all spectra we need to consider within realistic amounts of cpu time .",
    "] we will comment , however , in section ( [ subsec : errors ] ) on the differences expected with fits , where the yukawas are chosen to fit neutrino data correctly . in general , if @xmath10 is below , say , @xmath98 gev the differences of the full fit to our calculation with negligible yukawas is found to be completely irrelevant .",
    "if any hints of seesaw with @xmath10 in the range [ @xmath99 $ ] were indeed found in susy spectra , however , we expect that a full analysis would find results which differ by some ( @xmath100 ) % ( depending on the exact value of @xmath10 ) from our preliminary numbers .",
    "in this subsection we briefly summarize the differences in the calculated mass spectra of the different models and how this affects the lhc and ilc observables , which we use in our fits . in the following all numerical results shown in the figures",
    "have been calculated solving the full 2-loop rges numerically .",
    "moreover , we have taken into account the 1-loop thresholds of the seesaw particles at the seesaw scale as described in @xcite and include the one - loop contributions to the susy masses @xcite .",
    "we have also included the shifts of the gauge couplings to the @xmath101-scheme .",
    "it is instructive to discuss some ( semi- ) analytical approximations at 1-loop order , which will allow to understand qualitatively the numerical results .",
    "we stress that none of the following approximations is used in any way in the numerical calculations .",
    "the introduction of complete @xmath13 multiplets at a scale below the gut scale changes the running of the gauge couplings . at 1-loop order",
    "the gauge couplings at the different scales are given as @xcite @xmath102 here , @xmath103 for sm and @xmath104 for mssm .",

    "however , we have found that always @xmath118 is a critical input observable for our analysis . , which , however , is less important due to its larger error . ]",
    "the importance of @xmath118 can be understood from fig .",
    "( [ fig : running_masses_2 ] ) and ( [ fig : running_lhcobervables ] ) : coloured sparticle masses depend much more strongly on @xmath10 than masses of , for example , sleptons .",

    "the degree of confidence with which pmsugra can be distinguished from msugra plus seesaw depends sensitively on the actual value of the seesaw scale . at the `` critical '' value of @xmath8 , beyond which neutrino data can no longer be explained with yukawas smaller than 1",
    ", the difference between type - ii + msugra and pmsugra could be as low as only 1 @xmath141 c.l .",
    "however , the difference between pmsugra and msugra + seesaw rises very sharply with decreasing @xmath10 and formally more than 5 @xmath141 c.l .",
    "could be reached already at @xmath142 for type - ii .",
    "differences between pmsugra and msugra plus type - iii are always found to be larger than for msugra plus type - ii for the same value of @xmath10 .",
    "as expected , the future is not as bright , if we take into account only lhc data . nevertheless , using only lhc data",
    "one can distinguish pure msugra and msugra plus seesaw in some favourable parts of parameter space .",
    "especially , we point out that the lower the real value of the seesaw scale @xmath10 is , the easier it becomes to distinguish pure msugra from msugra plus seesaw . we have discussed the most important measurements for the lhc and the ilc and the relative errors with which these observables need to be measured for this analysis to be possible . in our analysis",
    "we used exclusively msugra susy breaking boundary conditions , but other , more involved susy breaking schemes with more free parameters could , in principle , be `` tested '' in a similar way .    of course , the analysis presented in this paper is far from being complete . if susy is found at the lhc",
    ", one would need to redo our calculations with real data .",
    "however , the experimentalist would not , as we have always assumed in our fits , know the real values of the parameters .",
    "we have tried for a few points , whether the correct input parameters can be retrieved for arbitrary starting points in our mc random walk procedure and - given enough cpu - time - are able to find the correct minimum . however , our `` observables '' are theoretically calculated observables and thus perfect in contrast to real data which are expected to scatter around the true values and might show tension between different observables .",
    "thus , finding the correct minimum in real data might be more difficult .",
    "moreover , the underlying model will not be known a priori and , thus , @xmath143 for different models need to be calculated and compared .",
    "nevertheless , even taking into account the limitations of our study , we think it is highly motivating that type - ii and type - iii seesaw leave sizeable traces in susy spectra , which should show up , if sufficiently accurate mass measurements are possible and become available .",
