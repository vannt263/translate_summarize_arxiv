    "for a finite group , one can evaluate a character on the sum of all @xmath0-th powers of the group elements .",
    "the resulting number , divided by the order of the group , is called the @xmath0-th frobenius - schur indicator of the character .",
    "the first use of these indicators was made by f.  g.  frobenius and i.  schur ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) to give a criterion when a representation of a finite group can be realized by matrices with real entries  for this question , it is the second indicator that is relevant .",
    "this is also meaningful for other fields than the complex numbers : here the indicator tells whether or not a given module is self - dual .",
    "higher indicators , i.e. , indicators with @xmath1 , arise when one considers the root number function in a finite group .",
    "this function assigns to a group element the number of its @xmath0-th roots , i.e. , the number of group elements whose @xmath0-th power is equal to the given element .",
    "it is clear that this number depends only on the conjugacy class , and therefore defines a class function that can be expanded in terms of the irreducible characters . using the orthogonality relations for characters , it is not hard to see that the coefficient of an irreducible character in this expansion is its @xmath0-th frobenius - schur indicator ( cf .",

    "( 4.4 ) , p.  49 ) .    for hopf algebras ,",
    "frobenius - schur indicators were first considered by v.  linchenko and s.  montgomery on the one hand ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and by j.  fuchs , a.  ch .",
    "ganchev , k.  szlachnyi , and p.  vecsernys on the other hand ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    ", the sum of the @xmath0-th powers of the group elements is replaced by the @xmath0-th sweedler power of the integral .",
    "the authors then use the indicators , or at least the second indicator , to prove an analogue of the criterion of frobenius and schur whether or not a representation is self - dual : the frobenius - schur theorem asserts that this depends on whether the second indicator is @xmath2 , @xmath3 , or @xmath4 .",
    "the topic of the present writing are the higher frobenius - schur indicators for semisimple hopf algebras and their relation to other invariants of irreducible characters .",
    "these other invariants are the order , the multiplicity , the exponent , and the index .",
    "let us briefly describe the nature of these invariants .",
    "the notion of the order of an irreducible character is a generalization of the notion of the order of an element in a finite group : it is the smallest integer such that the corresponding tensor power contains a nonzero invariant subspace .",
    "the dimension of this invariant subspace is called the multiplicity of the irreducible character .",
    "an irreducible character has order  1 if and only if it is trivial , and has order  2 if and only if it is self - dual . in these cases ,",
    "the multiplicity of the character is  1 .",
    "the exponent of a semisimple hopf algebra is another invariant , which generalizes the exponent of a group ( cf .",
    "the exponent of a module is a slight generalization of this concept : in the group case , it is the exponent of the image of the group in the representation .",
    "there are various ways to generalize this concept to semisimple hopf algebras ; we will use sweedler powers on the one hand and a certain canonical tensor on the other hand .",
    "the next invariant that we study , the index of imprimitivity , arises from perron - frobenius theory .",
    "it is clear that the matrix representation of the left multiplication by the character of a module with respect to the basis consisting of all irreducible characters has nonnegative integer entries . as we will explain below , the corresponding perron - frobenius eigenvalue , i.e. , the positive eigenvalue that has the largest possible absolute value , is the degree of the character .",
    "however , since the entries of the above matrix are in general not strictly positive , this eigenvalue is not necessarily strictly greater than the absolute values of the other characters , so that there can be other eigenvalues which are not positive , but have the same absolute value .",
    "as we will see , in the most interesting cases the above matrix is indecomposable ; in this case , the number of such eigenvalues is called the index of imprimitivity .",
    "the text is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : sweedlpow ] , we discuss the formalism of sweedler powers in an arbitrary bialgebra .",
    "a sweedler power of an element in a bialgebra is constructed by applying the comultiplication several times , permuting the arising tensor factors and multiplying them together afterwards .",
    "this notion is a slight modification of the original notion ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , where the tensor factors were not permuted , and has the advantage that iterated sweedler powers are still sweedler powers .",
    "we then consider the sweedler powers that arise from a certain special kind of permutations .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that the values of characters on the sweedler powers of the integral lie in certain cyclotomic fields , and this special kind of sweedler powers is well adapted to describe the action of the galois group on these values .    from section  [ sec : frobschur ] on",
    ", we consider semisimple hopf algebras over algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero .",
    "we prove a first formula for the higher frobenius - schur indicators that should be understood as a generalization of the frobenius - schur theorem for these indicators  in particular , it implies the frobenius - schur theorem for the second indicators .",
    "this first formula describes frobenius - schur indicators in terms of a certain operator on the corresponding tensor power of the module , and we establish several other properties of this operator as well .    in section  [ sec : exponent ]",
    ", we then consider the exponent of a module and prove a second formula for the higher frobenius - schur indicators that uses a certain canonical tensor . combining this with the first formula , we prove a version of cauchy s theorem for hopf algebras : a prime that divides the dimension of a semisimple hopf algebra must also divide its exponent .",
    "this result was conjectured by p.  etingof and s.  gelaki ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) ; it was known in the case of the prime  2 ( cf .",
    "furthermore , we prove that the higher indicators are integers if the exponent is squarefree .    in section  [ sec :",
    "order ] , we define the notion of the order and the multiplicity of a module and prove that the order of a module divides its multiplicity times the dimension of the hopf algebra .",
    "this result generalizes the theorem that a semisimple hopf algebra that has a nontrivial self - dual simple module must have even dimension ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) to modules of arbitrary orders  nontrivial self - dual simple modules are of order  2 , and the multiplicity is  1 in this case . in particular , we get in this way a fully independent new proof of the old theorem .    in section  [ sec : index ]",
    ", we study the index of imprimitivity , or briefly the index , of the matrix that represents the left multiplication by a character with respect to the canonical basis that we have in the character ring  the basis consisting of the irreducible characters .",
    "the main result of this section is a precise formula for the index in terms of central grouplike elements .",
    "essentially , the result says that the eigenvalues of the above matrix that have the same absolute value as the degree are obtained by evaluating the character at certain central grouplike elements . as a consequence of this formula ,",
    "we see that the index divides the order as well as the exponent .    in section  [ sec : drinfdouble ] ,",
    "we apply a new tool  the drinfeld double of the hopf algebra .",
    "we prove that , by restricting modules over the drinfeld double to the hopf algebra , we get a map from the character ring of the drinfeld double onto the center of the character ring of the hopf algebra . from this",
    ", we deduce that the center of the rational character ring of the hopf algebra , i.e. , the span of the irreducible characters over the rational numbers , is isomorphic to a product of subfields of the cyclotomic field whose order is the exponent of the hopf algebra . finally , we deduce a third formula for the frobenius - schur indicators in terms of the action of the drinfeld element on the induced module over the drinfeld double .    in section  [ sec : examples ] , we finally compute explicitly a number of examples . in this way",
    ", we can limit the possible generalizations of the results that we have obtained . the class of examples that we study are certain extensions of group rings by dual group rings .",
    "in particular , the drinfeld doubles of finite groups belong to this class .    throughout the whole exposition",
    ", we consider a base field that is denoted by  @xmath5 .",
    "all vector spaces considered are defined over  @xmath5 , and all tensor products without subscripts are taken over  @xmath5 . unless stated otherwise , a module is a left module .",
    "the set of natural numbers is the set  @xmath6 ; in particular , @xmath2 is not a natural number .",
    "the symbol  @xmath7 denotes the @xmath8-th cyclotomic field , and not the field of @xmath8-adic numbers , and  @xmath9 denotes the set  @xmath10 of integers modulo  @xmath8 , and not the ring of @xmath8-adic integers .    from section  [ sec : frobschur ] on , except for corollary  [ cauchy ] , we assume that the base field  @xmath5 is algebraically closed of characteristic zero .",
