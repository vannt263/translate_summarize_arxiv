    "we recall the classical chemostat model @xcite for a single species ( biomass @xmath0 ) consuming a substrate ( mass @xmath1 ) :    @xmath2    where the _ dilution rate _ @xmath3 ( the _ input _ ) is the manipulated variable , which takes values in a bounded positive interval @xmath4 $ ] , and @xmath5 is a non - negative lipschitz continuous function with @xmath6 .",
    "we consider here the following scenario : the function @xmath5 is unknown and possibly non - monotonic .",
    "our objective is to reconstruct the graph of the function @xmath5 on the domain @xmath7 by varying the input @xmath3 in time . on",
    "- line measurements are only available for the variable @xmath1 ( that is , @xmath1 is the _ output _ ) .",
    "this setup is realistic for experimental investigations such as in @xcite , however , demonstrations in this paper are based entirely on simulations of models such as system  .",
    "the present paper analyzes and expands the ideas initially proposed by the authors in the conference paper @xcite .    _",
    "remark : _ using model   tacitly assumes that the yield coefficient of the bio - conversion is known .",
    "this is why @xmath8 appears with the same pre - factor @xmath9 ( once positive , and once negative ) in both equations of without loss of generality .",
    "the problem of kinetics estimation in biological and biochemical models has been widely addressed in the literature ( @xcite ) , either as a parameter estimation problem ( one chooses a priori an analytical expression of the function @xmath5 ) , or as an on - line estimation of the kinetics ( one aims at determining @xmath10 at the current time @xmath11 ) .",
    "the theoretical identifiability of the graph of @xmath5 has been thoroughly studied in @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "a practical method has been proposed to reconstruct the graph of @xmath5 , based on a kalman observer under the approximation that the function @xmath12 has a third time derivative equal to zero .    here , we propose a different method that does not make any approximation of the dynamics .",
    "our method exploits that it is sufficient to find the complete branch of equilibria of system to identify the graph @xmath5 .",
    "this reduces the system identification problem to a combination of two problems : finding the equilibria ( a root - finding problem ) and stabilizing them ( a feedback control problem ) .",
    "both of the latter two problems are in theory easily solvable with standard methods as we will explain and illustrate in sections  [ section - basic - feedback][sec : hybrid ] . the most difficult obstacle in practice is the implementation of a real - time feedback loop measuring @xmath1 and adapting @xmath3 with sufficient accuracy .    when the growth function is monotonic , a common way to reconstruct points on the graph of the growth function @xmath5 is to design a series of experiments fixing the dilution rate @xmath3 with different values and wait until the system settles to a steady state @xmath13 @xcite . as long as @xmath3 is less than @xmath14 , it is well known that the dynamics converges to a unique positive equilibrium that satisfies @xmath15 ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "this technique requires the steady state to be stable in open loop , and consequently can not reconstruct any part of the graph of a function @xmath5 where @xmath16 is non - increasing ( such as the example shown schematically in figure  [ fig : stability ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the global convergence of this method is not satisfied in case of bi - stability , which is present in , with non - monotonic growth functions @xmath16 ( see again @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative approach is to fix a value of @xmath1 , say @xmath17 , and design an adaptive control law @xmath18 that stabilizes the system about the steady state @xmath19 , with the value of @xmath3 converging to @xmath20 .",
    "several adaptive control laws have been proposed in the literature for this problem .",
    "nonlinear feedbacks require the knowledge of the growth function @xmath5 , such as linearizing controls @xcite extensions that are robust with respect to uncertainty on @xmath5 have been proposed @xcite but do not provide the precise reconstruction of @xmath20 .",
    "several nonlinear pi based controllers , that do not require the precise knowledge of @xmath5 , have been also proposed @xcite , but saturation and windup is often an issue ( see @xcite in similar frameworks ) . in @xcite ,",
    "a dynamical output feedback has been proposed to globally stabilize such dynamics without the knowledge of @xmath5 and under the constraint @xmath21 $ ] , but it requires the growth function to be monotonic .",
    "more recently , a saturated pi controller coupled with an observer , dedicated to the non - monotonic case , have been proposed to stabilize the dynamics about a nominal point that maximizes the biomass production @xcite .    as the exploration of the unstable part of an unknown non - monotonic growth function requires an adaptive feedback , we propose in the present work to take advantage of an adaptation scheme for exploring ( at least ) a part of the graph instead of a limited number of set - points .",
    "we first consider that it can be useful to introduce a feedback control loop into to identify the growth function @xmath16 of the _ open - loop _ system ( that is , with constant input @xmath3 ) .",

    "we call feedback control that vanishes asymptotically _ non - invasive_. the result is a new adaptive control law that stabilizes the dynamics about any desired equilibrium point without requiring a priori knowledge of its location , and whatever is the monotonicity of the growth function .",
    "one requirement on the adaptive law is that it should work uniformly well around a local maximum of @xmath16 ( non - invasive feedback laws such as ( wash - out ) filtered feedback @xcite or time - delayed feedback @xcite do not achieve this ) .",
    "we note that our adaptation rules will be much simpler than classical adaptive control laws @xcite .",
    "usually , adaptive control aims to achieve a desired output regardless of changes in the underlying system .",
    "we only adapt the reference values to make the control input vanish and find branches of equilibria and bifurcations of the underlying system , similar to numerical continuation @xcite .",
    "while classical adaptive control requires system identification ( an inverse problem ) at some stage , our adaptation solves a root - finding problem , which is simpler .    throughout our paper",
    "we assume that the output @xmath1 can be sampled and the input @xmath3 can be adjusted in quasi real - time . if the sampling period @xmath33 is not negligible , the approach presented here can still be applied .",
    "however , one then faces the problem that feedback stabilization of an unstable equilibrium at output @xmath1 becomes sensitive with amplification factor @xmath34 to disturbances ( note that @xmath35 for unstable equilibria ) .",

    "if one treats @xmath17 as a parameter then the equilibria @xmath216 and @xmath184 undergo an exchange of stability ( a degenerate transcritical bifurcation ) at @xmath217 .",
    "as the adaptation rule lets @xmath17 drift slowly ( with speed @xmath114 ) the full system exhibits a phenomenon known as delayed loss of stability @xcite in the context of dynamic bifurcations @xcite , widely studied in slow - fast systems @xcite .",
    "say , we are decreasing @xmath17 slowly from above @xmath204 to below @xmath204 ( as in figure  [ simu2species](a ) ) . then concentration @xmath218 decreases exponentially , coming close to @xmath219 while @xmath212 .",
    "after @xmath220 has crossed @xmath204 , the concentration @xmath218 grows exponentially , but still takes some time until it reaches values noticeably different from @xmath219 .",
    "the value @xmath221 of @xmath17 at which @xmath218 becomes noticeably non - zero is in the ideal ode model independent of the drift speed @xmath114 of @xmath220 .",
    "figure  [ simu2species](a ) shows this effect : since @xmath218 is nearly zero the variable @xmath3 continues to follow the , by now unstable , drifting equilibrium @xmath184 . for a given @xmath212 and an arbitrary small @xmath222 at time @xmath219 ,",
    "the value @xmath223 at which @xmath218 reaches @xmath224 again when following , is given implicitly by the relation @xmath225 in the limit of small @xmath226 .",
    "this delay mechanism allows one in principle a reconstruction of a part of the smaller growth rate close to the bifurcation value of @xmath17 .",
    "_ remark 1 _ : from a practical view point , an apparent jump between the two graphs ( see evolution curves in black in fig .  [ simu2species ] ) could indicate the presence of another species , if one believes that the culture in chemostat was initially pure .",
    "nevertheless , one can still rely on the reconstruction of parts of growth curves for each species .     exploiting the delayed loss of stability for the dynamic control feedback law in the two species case with growth rates given in ( shown underlying in both panels ) .",

    "this is so , because the concentration of the suppressed species ( say , @xmath218 for @xmath203 in fig .",
    "[ simu2species](b ) ) can be made arbitrarily small by spending more time with @xmath212 . in practice",
    ", the suppression of species may not be perfect .",
    "for example , it may be impossible to suppress either species below a concentration @xmath234",
    ". then this concentration @xmath235 determines for how long the system will stay close to the invariant plane @xmath236 , when this plane is unstable .",
    "thus , @xmath235 determines how close one can get to the unstable equilibrium @xmath237 for @xmath209 ( together with the difference in growth rates , @xmath172 , which determines how unstable the plane @xmath236 is in @xmath17 ) .",
    "this is where the feedback control , @xmath238 } \\left(\\bar d - g_{1}(s-\\bar s)\\right)$ ] , has an effect : the unstable equilibrium @xmath237 has stronger attraction along the invariant line @xmath239 , because the third eigenvalue of @xmath185 , @xmath240 , can be made more negative by increasing @xmath40 .",
    "figure  [ discrete2species ] demonstrates that it is possible in principle to identify the growth rates of species in ranges of @xmath1 where they are suppressed ( even for positive @xmath241 ) , if the species is dominant in another region .",
    "the procedure was as follows ( for fig .",
    "[ discrete2species](a - c ) ) :    1 .   set @xmath28 to ` ( 0.1,0.75 ) ` , and wait until transients have settled ( implying that species @xmath202 is suppressed ) .",
    "the output @xmath1 settles to a value less than @xmath207 .",
    "2 .   then set @xmath28 to , say , ` ( 0.9,0.75 ) ` .",
    "one expects a transient that initially follows the invariant line @xmath242 where @xmath1 initially increases .",
    "3 .   as soon as @xmath1 stops increasing ( let s say , at @xmath243 ) , we know that the system now moves away from the plane @xmath244 .",
    "so , we read off @xmath3 , which is the estimate @xmath245 ( a black dot in fig .",
    "[ discrete2species](c ) ) , and go back to step 1 .    in figure  [ discrete2species](a - c ) switching occurs between @xmath246 ( where species 2 is stable ) and @xmath247 ( reading off @xmath213 ) .",
    "figure  [ discrete2species](d - f ) demonstrates the same procedure for identifying @xmath213 for @xmath201 .",
    "the only difference is that we read off @xmath248 at an inflection point @xmath243 of @xmath249 . in figure",
    "[ discrete2species](d - f ) switching occurs between @xmath250 ( where species @xmath202 is dominant ) and @xmath251 ( reading off @xmath213 in the region where species @xmath202 is suppressed ) .    the procedure , with its steps 13 is also possible without feedback control . however , feedback control increases the decay rate of the equilibrium with respect to disturbances , for example , within the invariant line @xmath242 in figure  [ discrete2species](a - c ) .",
    "thus , the system trajectory will come closer to the equilibrium before it diverges from the invariant line .",
    "figure  [ fig : gains2species ] demonstrates the effect of including the feedback term if suppression of the unwanted species @xmath202 is imperfect ( @xmath231 ) .",
    "the imperfect suppression is mimicked in our simulations by increasing @xmath252 ( @xmath253 ) to @xmath254 after each integration step if its value fell below @xmath254 in this step .",
    "the curves show the error relative to the difference between @xmath255 and @xmath213 . for @xmath256 ( no feedback control )",
    "@xmath23 in was varied to obtain different points approximating @xmath255 , otherwise @xmath17 in was varied ( @xmath17 has no effect if @xmath256 ) .",
    "the two approaches in fig .  [ simu2species ] and fig .  [ discrete2species ] correspond to two different choices for the trade - off between speed and accuracy . while the dynamic feedback in fig .",
    "[ simu2species ] requires only a single run , the procedure of switching back and forth between regions as rapidly as possible is able to obtain the growth rate of the suppressed species for abscissae @xmath1 more distant from @xmath204 .",
    "in this work , we have presented a framework for the functional identification of a large class of non - monotonic growth functions in the chemostat .",
    "the proposed methods achieve identification by tracing out branches of equilibria also through their unstable parts . at the core of the method",
    "is the observation that the introduction of a stabilizing feedback loop transforms the problem of finding equilibria of the original uncontrolled ( open - loop ) system to a root - finding problem , which can then be solved using either continuous and step - wise variants of classical numerical continuation algorithms @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations illustrate the potential of the method on the haldane function .",
    "an important issue in practice is how long it would typically take to identify the entire growth function in a real experiment . in our simple model with idealized feedback the control gain @xmath40 can be chosen arbitrarily large such that the identification could be sped up arbitrarily . in practice",
    "several effects place a limit on our choice of gain @xmath40 , such as output and state disturbances , and low sampling frequency for measurement and input .",
    "furthermore , both approaches ( sections [ section_continuation ] and [ sec : hybrid ] ) have a parameter controlling the trade - off between speed of the process and the accuracy of the results : the tracing speed @xmath226 of @xmath17 in section  [ section_continuation ] and the step - size @xmath257 in section  [ sec : hybrid ] ( larger steps result in a coarse mesh on which the growth function is determined ) .",
    "further investigations are required to find out how these parameters have to be chosen in real experiments .",
    "another application we plan to explore in the future are regulation problems .",
    "for example , one can regulate the single - species chemostat to operate at the substrate concentration @xmath1 at which the growth rate @xmath16 is maximal by following the same recipe .",
    "this approach to regulation , which is similar in spirit to the act - and - wait technique for delay compensation @xcite , does not require an a priori identification of the growth rate @xmath16 , and leads to a different algorithm than the methods discussed in the literature @xcite ) .",
