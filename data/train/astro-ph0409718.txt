    "the early results from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al . 2000 , abazajian et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 ) have shown that this survey is very effective in finding the shortest period ( oldest ) and lowest mass transfer rate ( faintest ) cataclysmic variables ( szkody et al .",
    "2002 ; 2003a ) .",
    "included among the new discoveries are two systems containing magnetic white dwarfs ( i.e. polars ) with extreme cyclotron features ; that is , very narrow , highly polarized cyclotron emission harmonics that show dramatic changes during the orbital cycle ( szkody et al 2003b ) .",
    "the lack of strong balmer emission lines and the narrow appearance of the cyclotron features imply very low temperature plasmas ( @xmath01 kev ) and accretion rates of @xmath010@xmath6m@xmath7 yr@xmath3 ( ferrario et al . 2002 ) .",
    "in this regime , the energy of the incoming flow is dissipated through particle collisions in the white dwarf atmosphere rather than in an accretion shock ( wickramasinghe & ferrario 2000 ) , a situation which is sometimes termed a `` bombardment solution '' ( kuijpers & pringle 1982 ) .    in order to check the consistency of this model , we obtained x - ray measurements of these two systems sdssj155331.12 + 551614.5 and sdssj132411.57 + 032050.5 ( hereafter abbreviated as sdssj1553 and sdssj1324 for simplicity ) with the _ xmm - newton _ satellite . from the data shown in szkody et al .",
    "( 2003b ) , these objects are known to have orbital periods of 4.39 hr and 2.6 hr respectively , derived from the @xmath81 mag sinusoidal modulations in the v and r light curves created by the changing cyclotron harmonics .",
    "the sinusoidal shapes of the variations imply that the magnetic poles are always in view . in each system , the wavelengths of the observed cyclotron harmonics are consistent with the 3rd and 4th harmonics in a magnetic field near 60 mg .",
    "the presence and strength of tio bands in sdssj1553 imply a secondary star of spectral type near m5v , and assuming a main - sequence mass - radius relation , a corresponding distance of 100 pc .",
    "the same assumptions for an m6v star in sdssj1324 yield a distance of @xmath5300 - 500 pc .",
    "detailed modelling of the spectrum of sdssj1553 ( ferrario et al .",
    "2002 ) indicates that it has an accretion rate three orders of magnitude smaller than a typical polar system , and an underlying very cool white dwarf with temperature of only 5000 - 8000k . with these very unusually low accretion rates and cool white dwarfs ,",
    "x - rays are not expected from the accretion spots ( woelk & beuermann 1992 ) .",
    "the rosat all sky survey provides upper limits of 0.04 and 0.02 c s@xmath3 for sdssj1553 and sdssj1324 .",
    "a recent survey of 37 polars using _ xmm - newton _ showed that 16 were in a low or reduced accretion state ( ramsay et al .",
    "2004 ) , with 6 not detected . of the 10 with detections",
    ", 8 showed orbital variations , indicating that some accretion was still occurring .",
    "of the 2 systems with no orbital variation ( cp tuc and mn hya ) , the observation times were too short to provide a spectrum .",
    "however , by assuming a 1 kev thermal plasma and an absorption of 1@xmath110@xmath9 @xmath10 , ramsay et al .",
    "( 2004 ) inferred x - ray luminosities for the two systems that were 15 - 20 times greater than that expected for normal late main sequence stars . with our long observation times on the extremely low accretion systems sdssj1553 and sdssj1324 , we are able to accomplish a spectral fit for sdssj1553 and obtain better luminosity constraints for the low states in both polars .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ satellite observes with three x - ray cameras ( the epic - pn has about twice the sensitivity of either the epic - mos1 or mos2 ; turner et al .",
    "2001 ) as well as x - ray reflection grating spectrographs ( our two systems were too faint for any useful data from the spectrographs ) and an optical monitor ( om ; mason et al .",
    "the om was used with a v filter for sdssj1553 and a white light filter for sdssj1324 .",
    "the data were analyzed following the abc guide from the _ xmm - newton _ us gof and analysis threads from the main vilspasw@xmath11cal / sas.shtml ] websites , using the sas v6.0 and calibration files current to 2004 march 23 .",
    "this included reprocessing of odf files to produce new event files .",
    "these were then screened using the standard expressions , and energies were restricted to the range 0.1 - 10 kev .",
    "finally , revised good time intervals were derived from high energy background light curves to exclude intervals of high background flaring . for the pn",
    ", source data were extracted using a 320 pixel radius circular aperture ( this only encircles @xmath12 of the energy , but reduces the background contribution for this low count - rate source ) and background was selected from adjacent rectangular regions at comparable detector y locations as the target . as advised in the guide , a conservative choice of event selection , pattern = 0 , was adopted .",
    "for the two mos detectors , a similar aperture size was used , but the background was determined from an annulus surrounding the source , chosen to exclude a neighboring faint source , and an event pattern@xmath1312 was also applied .",
    "light curves for both source and background were extracted using the sas task evselect , employing the same extraction regions as described above , but with a less conservative pattern@xmath134 for the pn events .",
    "the task lccor scaled and applied background subtraction , dead - time and vignetting corrections , to produce net source light curves with 100s binning .",
    "finally , the time stamps were converted from jd(tt ) to hjd(ut ) , using ftools tasks .",
    "the x - ray observation of sdssj1553 began on 2003 february 17 but was halted prematurely due to high radiation levels .",
    "additional data were obtained on 2003 march 12 to complete the observation .",
    "the om provided useful data during the x - ray observations ( figure 1 ) , while higher time resolution , ground - based ccd differential photometry in v and open filters was obtained on 2003 february 19 and 22 and june 29 using the united states naval observatory ( usno ) 1 m telescope ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the light curves all show the same variations as present in szkody et al ( 2003b ) , indicating that the accretion state was similarly low .",
    "the variation in the v and open filters is caused by the changing strength of the n=3 cyclotron harmonic at 6200 .",
    "in addition , the ground - based and om optical light curves allow a relative phasing of the x - ray data . due to the high radiation levels and other screening , the good time intervals of the x - ray data only span portions of the total observation length . with phase 0 defined as the minimum of the optical variation , the february good time intervals cover phases 0.75 - 1.43 ( 87.61 - 87.73 in figure 1 ) and the march observation covers phases 0.88 - 1.49 ( 111.24 - 111.35 in figure 1 ) .",
    "thus , most of the orbit is covered , and the portions from minimum to maximum light are sampled in each x - ray observation .",
    "sdssj1324 was observed with _",
    "xmm - newton _ on 2004 jan 25 .",
    "the source was barely detected with the most sensitive epic - pn instrument , so no time resolution was possible .",
    "the om data with 10 min bins and the usno data from the night before the _ xmm - newton _ observations ( figure 3 ) show the 2.6 hr variation previously identified as the orbital period .",
    "the x - ray observations of both systems are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the count rates for the february and march datasets on sdss1553 are consistent with each other , and the binned x - ray light curves show no variation throughout the observation intervals . a plot of x - ray count rate vs energy ( figure 4 ) for the epic - pn",
    ", -mos1 and -mos2 data shows that all of the observed x - ray flux for sdssj1553 emerges below 2 kev .",
    "a joint fit was performed in xspec on all the pn and mos data from each of the two runs .",
    "we binned the data to give @xmath14 counts per bin and used cash statistics to find the best overall fit .",
    "to accommodate any discrepancies in the relative pn and mos effective area calibrations , the normalizations were allowed to vary .",
    "similarly , the normalizations between the february and march runs were allowed to vary .",
    "sdssj1553 is nearby ( @xmath15 pc ) and at a galactic latitude of 47 deg , so the column density to the source is expected to be low .",
    "hence , this parameter was fixed at 1.3@xmath110@xmath9 @xmath10 , the value obtained from the heasarc column density tool .",
    "lcccllllll 1553 & 2003 - 02 - 17 & 02:29 - 07:38 & 0.020@xmath40.002 & 5130 & 0.009@xmath40.001 & 6396s & 0.006@xmath40.001 & 6394s & 16700 1553 & 2003 - 03 - 12 & 17:39 - 20:23 & 0.026@xmath40.003 & 7018 & 0.010@xmath40.001 & 9085 & 0.007@xmath40.001 & 9192 & 6000 1324 & 2004 - 01 - 25 & 02:27 - 07:28 & 0.0012@xmath40.0003 & 16234 & & & & & 13824    because of the uncertainties in the calibration at the lowest energies , fits were attempted using energies @xmath80.15 kev for pn and @xmath80.2 kev for mos , as well as more conservative limits of @xmath80.3 kev ( pn ) and @xmath80.5 kev ( mos ) .",
    "a thermal plasma ( mekal ) model with kt=0.78@xmath40.03 kev provided the best fit in both cases .",
    "however , figure 4 shows that there may be an additional soft component present at energies @xmath00.3 kev .",
    "this can be fit with a black body of roughly 46 ev which is poorly constrained ( 20 - 90ev is possible ) .",
    "table 2 gives the parameters of this type of fit and it is shown in figure 4 .",
    "we note that there are larger residuals to the fit at around 0.8 kev , most likely due to a combination of the noise and low energy resolution of the data and the complexity of the ( unresolved ) emission lines in this region ( see mukai et et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for higher resolution x - ray spectra of cataclysmic variables ) .",
    "the unabsorbed total flux ( 0.2 - 10 kev ) for the mekal fit alone is 6.7 - 7.9@xmath110@xmath16 ergs @xmath10 s@xmath3 . using the distance determined from the observed m star ( 100 pc ) yields an x - ray luminosity of 8.0 - 9.5@xmath110@xmath2 ergs s@xmath3 .",
    "the lack of hard x - rays and absence of modulation in the light curve corroborate that the x - ray source is not associated with an accretion shock at the magnetic pole , and that this low accretion rate is within the bombardment regime .",
    "however , the origin of x - ray flux that emerges even at these low rates is unclear .",
    "ramsay et al . ( 2004 ) concluded that there was still some level of ongoing accretion even in the systems showing no orbital modulation .",
    "however , this conclusion was based on assumptions about temperature and absorption , and a lack of information about the exact accretion level of cp tuc and mn hya .",
    "the pn count rates for cp tuc and mn hya are comparable to sdssj1553 , even though the former are 25 times further away .",
    "this alone implies that they have a higher level of accretion than sdssj1553 .",
    "many polars display a variety of low states , corresponding to different levels of accretion .",
    "the prototype , am her , is one such example , exhibiting high states with v mag of 12.5 , intermediate states near 13.5 and low states near 15.2 .",
    "fabbiano ( 1982 ) observed am her at an intermediate state of 14.5 and found the usual high state components ( 13.5 kev from the shock and 30 ev from the heated white dwarf ) replaced by a single 9 kev component .",
    "de martino et al . ( 1998 ) observed am her in one of its lowest states ( v=15.1 ) and found thermal x - ray flux with a temperature near 5.8 kev for part of the observation and then a drop in x - ray flux by a factor of 7 to the lowest level yet seen .",
    "this lowest portion showed a temperature @xmath83.6 kev , with a corresponding luminosity of 3@xmath110@xmath17 ergs s@xmath3 and an accretion rate of @xmath184@xmath110@xmath6m@xmath7/yr . since this temperature is higher than expected for coronal emission ( which is usually in the 0.25 - 1.7 kev range )",
    ", they concluded that there was likely still some residual accretion , but that the secondary could have a substantial contribution to the x - ray flux .",
    "sdssj1553 has the lowest accretion level known ( 3 orders of magnitude below most polars and an order of magnitude below am her in its lowest state ) , a value that is consistent with wind accretion from the companion .",
    "there is no broad line emission , nor evidence of any type , for a mass transfer stream from the secondary to the white dwarf .",
    "thus , this system might best serve as a template for the base level of x - ray flux in a polar .",
    "the extremely low white dwarf temperature of sdssj1553 indicates that the average accretion rate over about the last million years ( the kelvin - helmholtz time scale of the compressionally heated envelope ) can not have been larger than @xmath53@xmath110@xmath19m@xmath7 yr@xmath3 ( townsley & bildsten 2004 ) .",
    "this raises the distinct possibility that the secondary in sdssj1553 has not yet contacted its roche lobe , a fact consistent with the inferred m5 spectral type if the main - sequence mass - radius relation applies . as such",
    ", sdssj1553 would be the first pre - polar known , and possibly a precursor to objects such as rxj1313.2 - 3259 ( gnsicke et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the temperature of the plasma that is emitting x - rays in sdssj1553 is in the regime for a coronal source . for its orbital period and spectral type ,",
    "the mass of the secondary is likely near 0.4m@xmath7 ( warner 1995 ) . from the mass - luminosity relation of malkov , piskunov & shipilkina ( 1997 ) ,",
    "the total luminosity of the secondary should be near 1@xmath110@xmath20 ergs s@xmath3 .",
    "given that the secondary should be in the saturated regime with l@xmath21/l@xmath22 @xmath0 10@xmath23 , the x - ray luminosity should be less than 10@xmath24 ergs s@xmath3 .",
    "the observed x - ray luminosity is compatible with this limit .",
    "thus , sdssj1553 appears to be an excellent candidate for coronal emission of x - rays .",
    "even though the infalling gas cools almost exclusively through electron cyclotron emission at these very low accretion rates , a blackbody component is expected due to surface heating from the downward - directed cyclotron flux .",
    "the `` bombardment '' calculations of woelk & beuermann ( 1992 , 1993 ) indicate that irradiation occurs from a rosseland optical depth @xmath25 to @xmath26 and that reprocessing from the underlying photosphere should appear as an euv component with a temperature of @xmath510@xmath27  k. the spectral fit with a mekal+blackbody model gives a total 0.01@xmath2810  kev flux of 1.2@xmath281.5@xmath29 ergs @xmath10 s@xmath3 , with the blackbody contributing 32@xmath2835% of this flux .",
    "this is @xmath525% of the observed cyclotron flux ( ferrario et al .",
    "2002 ) , and for a distance of 100 pc amounts to a luminosity of 4.7@xmath286.2@xmath30 ergs s@xmath3 .",
    "our temperature estimate of 50  ev ( 600,000  k ) leads to an unrealistically small radius for the emission region of 5@xmath31  cm , or 0.006% of the radius of a 0.7  @xmath32 white dwarf .",
    "unfortunately , the upturn in the flux occurs at energies where the calibrations are most uncertain , so the temperature is very uncertain and the mere existence of this component must be confirmed ( e.g. with more sensitive / better calibrated x - ray observations ) .",
    "ramsay et al .",
    "( 2004 ) used the uv filters on their om observations to determine that a low temperature component was present outside the bandpass of the xmm detectors .",
    "but since their objects exhibited higher accretion rates and x - ray luminosities , it is difficult to directly compare results .",
    "lccccc 1553 & mekal & 0.78@xmath40.026 & 1.3 & & 6.7 - 7.9 1553 & mekal+bb & 0.79@xmath40.026 & 1.3 & 46 & 12 - 15 1324 & mekal & 0.2 & 2.0 & & @xmath00.6      sdssj1324 was too faint to provide more than an upper limit to the x - ray flux . in the pn ,",
    "the background contribution and faint source counts are comparable within our analysis aperture .",
    "a very crude `` spectrum '' was constructed from 4 energy bins , and a background power law model was scaled to contribute 50% in the source aperture and then added to the source model .",
    "the column found from the heasarc tool ( 2@xmath110@xmath9 @xmath10 ) was then fixed and the temperature was stepped from 0.2 - 1 kev .",
    "the best fit was at 0.3 kev , but for an upper limit we used 0.2 kev to determine a 0.2 - 10 kev flux of 4@xmath110@xmath33 ergs @xmath10 s@xmath3 and an unabsorbed flux of 6@xmath110@xmath33 ergs @xmath10 s@xmath3 .",
    "the corresponding x - ray luminosity is 7@xmath110@xmath2 ergs s@xmath3 for an assumed distance of 300 pc .",
    "our x - ray observations of the extremely low accretion rate polar sdssj1553 reveal a low count rate of 0.030@xmath40.003 c / s , no detectable variation of the x - ray flux throughout the orbit ( while the optical shows large variations due to the changing amplitude of the cyclotron harmonics ) , and a spectrum that can be modeled by a thermal plasma with a temperature near 0.8 kev .",
    "the x - ray flux translates into a luminosity below 10@xmath24 ergs s@xmath3 .",
    "the low count rate of sdssj1324 ( 0.0012@xmath40.0003 ) is also consistent with this x - ray luminosity .",
    "all these characteristics imply an origin of the x - rays from coronal emission on the secondary star , rather than an accretion shock . the sensitivity of @xmath34 has allowed the base level of x - ray emission from a close binary to be measured .",
    "further x - ray monitoring of these stars whose mass transfer has turned off can reveal if the flare activity of m stars in close binaries is enhanced due to the close proximity of its companion white dwarf .",
