    "<S> the situation is different for the transition @xmath2 . as shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> we claim that the phase observed for @xmath78 is the spin - singlet phase , where the expectation value of the collective spin operator associated with the orbitals is zero ( see supplementary material ) . for higher values of @xmath79 </S>",
    "<S> , there is a phase transition from the spin - singlet phase to a particle - hole conjugate @xmath70 laughlin phase of the antisymmetric state . </S>",
    "<S> although a similar phase transition was obtained for the conventional bilayer system @xcite , as noted above , the interaction in this system is not su(2 ) symmetric , and therefore , the observation of spin - singlet phase has a different origin . </S>",

    "<S> the above claims are justified by the investigation of the populations of lls and symmetric and antisymmetric states for both @xmath1 and @xmath2 transitions ( see supplementary material ) . </S>",
    "<S> due to the fact that full wave function can have even parity for the interchange of particle coordinates with different ll indices , @xmath80 pseudopotentials are responsible for different physics observed for two transitions . for @xmath1 transition , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath80 pseudopotential corresponding to direct terms is considerably larger compared to @xmath2 transition . </S>",
    "<S> this direct term competes with the cross term and hinders the formation of the singlet phase for @xmath1 transition ( see supplementary material ) .    in the large tunneling limit ( @xmath73 ) , the situation for @xmath2 is similar to @xmath1 case . specifically , since the single particle orbits energy gap is large @xmath81 , compared to the coulomb energy , the state remains polarized , and the overlap with dressed laughlin state is large , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : endepo](d ) . however , when the tunneling decreases , the cross terms of the interaction force the system to form a singlet . in the overlap calculation for the spin - singlet trial wave function , we used a model interaction potential similar to the one used for jain s spin - singlet state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , in the interaction potential , we have kept only the @xmath80 and @xmath82 haldane pseuodopotentials and set them equal to 1 . for the cross terms of the interaction , </S>",
    "<S> we choose @xmath83 which gave the highest overlap of 93 % . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : endepo ] ( d ) , the overlap with spin - singlet trial wave function is almost constant for small @xmath78 and abruptly drops to zero after the phase transition for @xmath79 . due to the presence of cross terms </S>",
    "<S> , the obtained singlet state has infinitesimal overlap with jain s spin - singlet state , and therefore , is a different many - body singlet state , which deserves further analytical investigations .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we have assumed that the electronic system thermalizes to the ground state in the rotating frame of the optical drive field . to estimate the validity of this approximation </S>",
    "<S> , we have to compare the timescale for relaxation of the optically excited landau levels to the timescale for thermalization of the electronic system with the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the carrier lifetime of optically excited landau levels has contributions from optical relaxation , phonon relaxation , and auger scattering into other landau levels @xcite . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , it was measured at moderate magnetic fields in epitaxial graphene samples to be roughly 10 - 20 ps . although , one expects longer lifetimes in higher quality graphene samples suitable to observe the fqh effect , we can use this as an upper bound on the relaxation rate . in our units of coulomb interaction @xmath63 </S>",
    "<S> , this timescale translates to roughly @xmath84 to @xmath85 , depending on the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we roughly estimate the thermalization time by the size of the many - body gap in the spectrum , which , from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : endepo ] , is on the order of @xmath86 . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , there is a large separation of timescales between the thermalization and carrier relaxation , which allows our system to remain in the rotating frame ground states before carrier relaxation . in our case </S>",
    "<S> , the laughlin state of the driven regime can be adiabatically connected to the laughlin state of a non - driven regime . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one can adiabatically prepare the system by slowly turning on the light field . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the singlet state can not be connected to the non - driven regime , which makes the thermalization problem particularly relevant . </S>",
    "<S> a more detailed study of the thermalization dynamics in this regime is beyond the scope of the present work ; however , it is worth noting that there has been recent progress in understanding of thermalization of driven isolated systems @xcite and also thermalization of floquet systems coupled to a bath @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , it has been pointed out that electron - phonon interaction and specific fermi reservoirs could lead to thermalization of the system in the rotating frame , in the long time steady - state limit @xcite .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have considered single layer graphene sheet in the fqh regime with an externally applied optical field that is resonant between two lls of graphene . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that a two - component fqh system can be constructed with two lls that are brought into resonance with the light , where the external light field plays the role of tunneling between two layers . for the @xmath1 case , </S>",
    "<S> the system is always in particle - hole conjugate laughlin 1/3 phase : as the tunneling rate increases , the system changes from being polarized in ll to being polarized in the state of antisymmetric superposition of lls . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for the transition @xmath2 , we were able to demonstrate the phase transition between spin - singlet and particle - hole conjugate laughlin 1/3 phase for a critical value of @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - singlet phase and the associated phase transition observed for the @xmath2 case arise from the cross terms of the inter ll interaction , which are absent in usual multicomponent systems . </S>",
    "<S> similar fqh phases induced by light in other 2d materials with dirac bands , such as monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides @xcite will be subject of future works . </S>",
    "<S> this study gives new impetus towards experimental realization of multicomponent fqh states and _ in situ _ control of the phase transition using externally applied optical fields .    </S>",
