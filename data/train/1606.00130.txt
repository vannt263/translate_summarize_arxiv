    "[ [ section ] ]    probabilistic computing is a thriving field of computer science and mathematics and is widely viewed as a powerful approach for tackling the daunting problems of searching , detection and inference posed by the ever increasing amount of `` big data '' .",
    "@xcite much of this work , however , is software - based , utilizing standard general purpose hardware that is based on high precision deterministic logic.@xcite the building block for this standard hardware is the ubiquitous transistor which has the key properties of gain and directionality that allow billions of them to be interconnected to perform complex tasks .",
    "this paper proposes a transistor - like device that could provide an analogous building block for probabilistic logic .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    a number of authors @xcite have recognized that the physics of nanomagnets can be exploited for stochastic logic and natural random number generators to replace the complex circuitry that is normally used",
    ". however , these are individual stochastic circuit elements within the standard framework of complementary metal oxide semiconductor ( cmos ) transistors , which provide the necessary gain and directionality .",
    "by contrast , what we are proposing in this paper are networks constructed out of magnet - based stochastic devices that have been individually engineered to provide transistor - like gain and directionality so that they can be used to construct large scale circuits without external transistors ( fig.[f1]a ) .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    feynman ( 1982 ) alluded to a probabilistic computer based on probabilistic hardware that could efficiently solve problems involving classical probability , contrasting it with a quantum computer based on quantum hardware that could efficiently solve quantum problems .",
    "this paper inspired much work on quantum computing , but we would like to draw attention to his description of a probabilistic computer : `` _ _  the other way to simulate a probabilistic nature , which i ll call n .. is by a computer c which itself is probabilistic , .. in which the output is not a unique function of the input .  it simulates nature in this sense : that c goes from some .. initial state .. to some final state with the same probability that n goes from the corresponding initial state to the corresponding final state .",
    " if you repeat the same experiment in the computer a large number of times  it will give the frequency of a given final state proportional to the number of times , with approximately the same rate  as it happens in nature .",
    "_ _ '' the possibility of probabilistic computing machines has also been addressed by more recent authors .",
    "@xcite the primary purpose of this paper is to introduce the concept of a ` transynapse ' , a device that can be interconnected in large numbers to build probabilistic computers ( fig.[f1 ] ) .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    the transynapse combines a synapse - like function with a transistor - like gain and directionality and in section 2 we describe a device that uses the established physics of nanomagnets to implement it .",
    "we present a specific design for the transynapse which is simulated using experimentally benchmarked models ( supplementary section @xmath0 ) for established phenomena to demonstrate the stochastic sigmoid transfer function . in section 3",
    "we use these same models to show how transynapses can be used to build either of two fundamentally different class of networks , an ising like network with symmetric network interactions and a non - ising network with directed interactions . in section 4",
    "we then present two proof - of - concept examples of belief networks , one reciprocal and the other non - reciprocal , implemented using transynapses which are simulated with the same experimentally validated models used in section 2 .",
    "the transynapse consists of a write unit and a read unit ( figs.[f1],[f2 ] ) , electrically isolated from each other .",
    "the write unit of transynapse @xmath1 sums a set of input signals @xmath2 , integrates them over a characteristic time scale @xmath3 to obtain a quantity    [ iin&iout ] @xmath4    [ [ section-4 ] ]    in this paper we use a specific design for this device following that described in datta et al.@xcite which uses an input write unit magnetically coupled to , but electrically isolated from an output read unit .",
    "it provides the required gain , fan - in and fan - out , making use of experimentally benchmarked models ( supplementary section @xmath0 ) for the established physics of the spin hall effect ( she ) for the input and the magnetic tunnel junction ( mtj ) for the output .",
    "however , for transynapse operation , we need to operate it in a probabilistic mode not considered before , where the input and output are not deterministic variables but stochastic ones .",
    "this could be done by using nanomagnets with low energy barriers ( @xmath5 ) that are in the super paramagnetic regime considering long enough programming times .",
    "the output ( y - axis in fig.2b ) could then be interpreted as the time averaged magnetization of a single magnet along its easy axis .",
    "however , in this paper we use a different approach as explained below .",
    "[ [ section-5 ] ]    for the simulations presented in this paper , nano - magnets are initialized along their hard axis at t=0 and then allowed to relax .",
    "the output is obtained from a statistical average of the magnetization @xmath6 along the easy axis obtained from 1000 monte carlo runs based on the stochastic landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation , one for each magnet ( write and read ) coupled through a magnetic interaction as in @xcite .",
    "the details are described in supplementary section @xmath0 .",
    "fig.[f2]b shows that the numerically obtained average @xmath6 is described well by the relation    @xmath7    where @xmath8 , @xmath9 being the anisotropy field , @xmath10 , the gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath11 is the damping parameter .",
    "also @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the switching current for the nanomagnet@xcite , while the factor @xmath14 depends on its energy barrier @xmath15 and is given by the relation @xmath16 obtained from numerical simulations .",
    "factor @xmath17 ( 6 for @xmath18 and 24 for @xmath19 ) determines how fast the magnetization relaxes depending on the ambient temperature .",
    "the results were obtained using different ( fig.[f2]b inset ) input currents of the form @xmath20 , but the resulting output is well described by a single curve @xmath21 irrespective of the amplitude @xmath22 and decay time parameter @xmath23 .",
    "this independence to time - decay parameters suggests that the probability of finalizing a magnet in one of the two states essentially depends on the number ( @xmath24 where @xmath25 ) of bohr magnetons ( units of electron spin ) imparted on it .",
    "@xcite indeed , similar underlying principles have been demonstrated experimentally in ref.@xcite in somewhat different set ups for switching magnets from one state to the other in the short pulse regimes well above @xmath13 .",
    "[ [ section-6 ] ]    it is important to note the key attributes of the device that are needed to enable the construction of belief networks by interconnecting hundreds of devices .",
    "firstly , it is important to ensure input - output isolation , which is achieved by having magnetically coupled write and read magnets separated by an insulator as shown .",
    "this separation would not be needed if the magnet itself were insulating ( like yig , yttrium iron garnet ) .",
    "the second important attribute is its gain defined as the maximum output charge current relative to the minimum charge current needed to swing the probability from 0.5 ( fully stochastic ) to 1 ( fully deterministic ) .",
    "this is the quantity that determines the maximum fan - out that is possible which is particularly important if we want a high degree of inter connectivity .",
    "the physics of she @xcite helps provide gain since for each device , it can be designed @xcite to provide more spin current to the write magnet than the charge current provided by the read unit of the preceding stage .",
    "[ [ section-7 ] ]    the third attribute of the proposed device is its ability to sum multiple inputs and this can be done conveniently since it is current - driven .",
    "a write circuit consisting of a she metal like tantalum provides a current - driven low impedance input , different from the voltage - driven high input impedance field - effect transistors ( fet s ) .",
    "the low input impedance ensures that the total current into the write unit is determined by the output impedance of the read units of preceding stages @xcite .",
    "this impedance is set by the intrinsic resistance of the read units which could be on the order of a @xmath26 if using magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtj s ) or could be much lower if using the inverse spin hall effect ( ishe).@xcite in either case an external series resistor r could be used to raise the output impedance as shown in fig .",
    "@xmath27 @xmath28 being the external voltage , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the parallel and anti - parallel resistance of the mtj , @xmath31 , the input resistance of the next device and @xmath32 is the external series resistance which can be used to weight the outputs appropriately .",
    "the weighting of the output can also be accomplished by tuning @xmath28 where multiple bipolar output weights sharing the same input can be implemented via a common write unit with multiple read units as shown in fig.[f5]a .",
    "@xcite    [ [ section-8 ] ]    we envision that the detailed physics used to implement the transynapse will evolve , especially the physics used for the write , the read and/or the weighting , since this field is in a stage of rapid development with new discoveries being reported on a regular basis . the input ( or write )",
    "circuit could utilize phenomena other than the she used here , just as the output ( or read ) circuit could use mechanisms other than mtj s .",
    "similarly , the nanomagnet can be initialized in a neutral state with modern voltage driven mechanisms @xcite like voltage controlled anisotropy , or with established methods like an external magnetic field @xcite or spin torque @xcite , or thermal assistance @xcite . alternatively ,",
    "as mentioned earlier nanomagnets in the super paramagnetic regime could be used with the mean state @xmath33 defined by a time average instead of an ensemble average .",
    "the purpose of this manuscript is simply to establish the general concept of a transynapse that integrates a synapse - like behavior with a transistor - like gain and isolation , thus permitting the construction of compact large scale belief networks .",
    "[ [ section-9 ] ]    note also that our transynapses are assumed to communicate via charge current since that is a well - established robust form of communication .",
    "however , communication could be influenced through spin channels ( as in all - spin logic @xcite ) or through spin waves requiring very different write and read units .",
    "[ [ section-10 ] ]    a key feature of transynapse is the flexibility it affords in adjusting the weight @xmath34 that determines the influence of one transynapse ( @xmath1 ) on another ( @xmath35 ) , by adjusting the parameters of the read unit of @xmath1 .",
    "the weight @xmath36 on the other hand is controlled independently through the read unit of @xmath35 .",
    "if we choose @xmath37 , we have a bidirectional or reciprocal network similar to the type described by an ising model described by a hamiltonian @xmath38 . in such networks",
    "the probability @xmath39 of a specific configuration , @xmath40 is known to be given by the principles of equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "[ pnen ] @xmath41    [ [ section-11 ] ]    ising models are closely related to boltzmann machines ( @xcite ) whose probabilities described by eq.[pn ] seek configuration with low @xmath42 .",
    "for example , with three transynapses connected through @xmath43 , @xmath42 is minimized for configurations @xmath44 and @xmath45 with equal @xmath46 .",
    "this is the ferromagnetic ( fm ) ising model .",
    "but if @xmath47 , @xmath42 would be a minimum if all @xmath46 had opposite signs .",
    "since this is impossible with three transynapses , the energy is lowest for all six configurations that have one ` frustrated ' pair @xcite :",
    "@xmath48    [ [ section-12 ] ]    the numerical simulation of the 3-transynapse network shows ( fig.[f3]a ) this expected behavior with equal probabilities for configurations a , b , c , and reduced probabilities for the two remaining configurations @xmath44 and @xmath49 for which all three pairs are frustrated .",
    "situation is different when one of the bonds is directed as in fig.[f3]b .",
    "not surprisingly , the probability is highest for the configuration having @xmath50 and @xmath51 as the frustrated pair ( configuration a in eq.[conspa ] ) .",
    "less obviously , configuration b with @xmath52 , @xmath51 as the frustrated pair has a higher probability than configuration c with @xmath52 , @xmath50 as the frustrated pair .",
    "this is because @xmath50 only has one bond ( from @xmath52 ) dictating its state ( no conflict ) but @xmath51 has two bonds ( from @xmath52 and @xmath50 ) dictating its state which can be at odds with each other . such configuration of bonds and the resulting configuration space probabilities have no ising analog .",
    "[ [ section-13 ] ]    note that our numerical results are all obtained directly by simulating a set of coupled llg equations , one for each of the six magnets , two per transynapse .",
    "the time evolution of each magnet in each device is a function of its instantaneous state @xmath53 , internal , external and thermally fluctuating fields ( determined by temperature @xmath54 ) , plus the spin torque @xmath55 it receives from other devices : @xmath56 bi - directional interactions have both @xmath55 and @xmath57 but directional interactions have either @xmath55 or @xmath57 .",
    "supplementary section 1 provides more detail .    .",
    "the polarity of @xmath28 for each transynapse is such that it favors the next transynapse to have an opposite state to its own as in anti - ferromagnetic ( af ) ordering .",
    "statistical information is then gathered from monte - carlo runs .",
    "there are a total of @xmath58 configurations possible with their probabilities shown in fig.[f3 ] a. this is reminiscent of frustration in spin glasses @xcite also observed in ising model as shown in the inset .",
    "such bidirectional connections can be used for building boltzmann machines@xcite closely related to ising models .",
    "more on this in fig.[f4 ] . *",
    "( b ) * changing one of the connections in part ( a ) to be directed as opposed to bi- directional lowers the probability of occurrence of some states in the final configuration resulting in reduced frustration .",
    "this is fundamentally not possible by inherently symmetric hamiltonian based systems such as ising model .",
    "such directed connections can be used to represent causal influences in bayesian networks @xcite .",
    "more on this in figs.[f5],[f6].,title=\"fig:\",width=529,height=264 ] +",
    "[ [ section-14 ] ]    the connection between ising model of statistical mechanics @xcite and hard combinatorial optimization problems of mathematics has been known for decades.@xcite boltzmann machines @xcite and subsequently their restricted version for deep belief networks are ising models in which the weights of interactions are learned and adjusted with breakthrough algorithms.@xcite there is also widespread activity and innovation on the connection of inference , commonly used in belief networks , and phase transitions in statistical physics ( see e.g. ref.@xcite for a thorough review ) .",
    "figure [ f4 ] shows how networks described in this paper ( fig.[f1 ] ) can mimic magnetic phase transition which is also a well known result of the ising model .",
    "the caption provides more detail for the particular procedure used for obtaining this .",
    "phase transition is evident as the rate of change of magnetization with respect to temperature exhibits a maximum followed by a decrease .",
    "this transition is not sharp because of the small lattice sizes used here ( see ref.@xcite for a more in - depth discussion ) .",
    "solid line shows the analogous ising model result with the same lattice size ( 4 by 4 array ) using equilibrium laws of statistical mechanics .",
    "the peak exhibited is reminiscent of the curie temperature of magnetic phase transition ( supplementary section 3 ) .",
    "indeed , the effective curie temperature observed in these networks depends linearly on the strength of device to device communication set by @xmath28 ( fig.[f2 ] ) .",
    "( supplementary section 4 provides spontaneous magnetization curves with interactions of various strength ) .",
    "this is in agreement with onsager s @xcite results for a two dimensional array of ferromagnetic atoms for which @xmath59 is proportional to @xmath60-coupling strength .",
    "we take these as an indication that stochastic networks of transynapses could be used to construct ( restricted ) boltzmann machines for deep belief networks where weights can be adjusted by the bipolar voltages applied to transypases or by load resistances at the output of transynapses .",
    "( fig.[f2 ] )     ( @xmath61 ) is applied to all transynapses making the interactions favor all devices in the same state similar to ferro - magentic ordering ( fm ) .",
    "at each temperature @xmath54 ( scaled by @xmath62 , where @xmath60 is the coupling strength . see also supplementary sections 3 and 4 ) , the circuit is initialized and left to interact while the network decides on a final state out of @xmath63 possible states .",
    "after each trial , the magnetization of the array is obtained by summing over all transynapse states leading to an average magnetization of the array based on the total number of monte carlo runs . from this data , differential of magnetization with respect to temperature can be obtained as shown .",
    "this is reminiscent of magnetic phase transition @xcite exhibiting a curie temperature in ising model depicted by the solid line . in deep belief networks",
    "@xcite , the closely related restricted boltzmann machines @xcite trained by breakthrough algorithms that determine the interactions are used to solve search , detection and inference problems .",
    "@xcite , title=\"fig:\",width=340,height=283 ] +      [ [ section-15 ] ]    symmetric interactions are inherent to hamiltonian based systems as in ising model and boltzmann machines . on the other hand ,",
    "directed interactions have their own prominence in bayesian networks @xcite .",
    "figure [ f5]a shows a 3-transynapse network , with each transynapse representing one of three variables which we could call carrot , stick and performance .",
    "these variables can be in one of two possible states    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     with distinct probabilities .",
    "the transynapse network is interconnected to reflect the causal interconnections among the three variables .",
    "the carrot affects both the state of stick and the state of performance through the voltages @xmath64 and @xmath65 which determine the weights @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the only other causal effect is that of the stick on the performance which is reflected in the voltage @xmath68 and the resulting weight @xmath69 .",
    "[ [ section-16 ] ]    a direct simulation of this 3-transynapse network using coupled llg equations ( eq .",
    "[ llg ] ) yields the plot shown in fig.[f5]b . with @xmath70 ( voltages and currents are normalized by the magnitude required for deterministic switching ) ,",
    "we get the diagonal lines reflecting perfect correlation of the stick with the carrot , while with @xmath71 , we get the other diagonal line reflecting perfect anti - correlation",
    ". we could view these respectively as a copy gate and a not gate with probabilistic inputs and outputs .",
    "the other curves shown in fig.[f5]b correspond to @xmath72 reflecting a situation where the stick state is not entirely controlled by the carrot , but has a probability of no punishment irrespective of the carrot .",
    "+    [ [ section-17 ] ]    the network can naturally generate probabilities of various variables .",
    "consider e.g. the triangle ( scenario a ) in fig.[f5]b where carrot has 0.6 probability of reward ( scenario b is the square ) . instead of performing the necessary algebra of @xmath73 to obtain the probability of stick being in the punishment mode , the transynapse network takes in @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and produces the directly observable probability of stick being in punishment mode .",
    "this generalizes to more variables and an example for three is discussed next .",
    "[ [ section-18 ] ]    figure [ f6]a , b shows how the network in fig.[f5]a can be used in predictive mode based on known casual connections @xcite among different variables which determine the electrical signals @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( explicitly provided in the caption ) .",
    "these in turn can provide the values in the ( conditional ) probability tables of fig.[f6]a .",
    "for example , the element indexed by ( 1,@xmath79 ) in the @xmath80 table is the mean value of the state of stick in the @xmath79 mode when @xmath81 .",
    "( this can also be obtained independently by dictating the carrot is in the reward ( @xmath81 ) state e.g. by providing a strong bias ( @xmath82 ) and finding the mean value for the state of stick due to @xmath64 ) while the likelihood of better performance can be found from tables of fig.[f6]a by calculating @xmath83 , this is directly observable from the mean value of the state of ` performance ' which is naturally generated by the network as provided in fig .",
    "alternatively , the network can address inference problems .",
    "suppose performance is better , is it due to carrot or stick or both ?",
    "for instance , the likelihood that performance is better because of reward is essentially @xmath84 .",
    "this can be obtained by the algebra , @xmath85 , or directly observed by taking the mean value of the state of carrot in the reward mode when performance is better .",
    "the resulting values are provided in fig.[f6]c .     +",
    "[ [ section-19 ] ]    probabilistic computing is a thriving field of computer science and mathematics that deals with extracting knowledge from available data to guide decisive action .",
    "the work in this area is largely based on deterministic hardware and major advances can be expected if one could build probabilistic hardware to simulate probabilistic logic . in this paper",
    "we define a building block for such stochastic networks , which we call a transynapse combining the transistor - like properties of gain and isolation with synaptic properties .",
    "we present a possible implementation based on the established physics of nano magnets . using experimentally benchmarked models for the transynapse we present examples illustrating the implementation of both boltzmann machines and bayesian networks .",
