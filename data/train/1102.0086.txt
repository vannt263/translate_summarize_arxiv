    "gravitational lensing is such a phenomena resulting from the deflection of light rays in a gravitational field , which plays an essential role in the astrophysics because it can help us extract the information about the distant stars which are otherwise too dim to be observed .",
    "the strong gravitational lensing is caused by a compact object with a photon sphere ( such as black hole)@xcite . when the photons pass close to the photon sphere , the deflection angles of the light rays diverge and an observer can detect two infinite sets of faint relativistic images on each side of the black hole @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the relativistic images can provide us not only some important signatures about black holes in the universe , but also profound verification of alternative theories of gravity in their strong field regime .",
    "thus , the strong gravitational lensing by black holes has been studied extensively in various theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "most studies of the strong gravitational lensing are focused on black holes immersed in the rather idealized isotropic homogeneous universe .",
    "it is more reasonable to consider the universe background as homogeneous but with global rotation since the rotation is a universal phenomenon in our universe .",

    "the generalizations of gdel universe in the minimal five - dimensional gauged supergravity has been found in @xcite . like in the original four - dimensional gdel solution",
    ", there also exist the close timelike curves in these five - dimensional supersymmetric gdel spacetimes .",
    "exact solutions describing various black holes immersed in the five - dimensional rotating gdel universe were found in @xcite , which obey to the usual black hole thermodynamics .",
    "the studies indicate that the quasinormal modes @xcite and hawking radiation @xcite of these black holes are considerably affected by the rotating cosmological background . using the squashing transformation , the new squashed kaluza - klein black hole solutions in the rotating universe",
    "have been obtained in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the wave dynamics of the charged squashed kaluza - klein gdel black hole has been investigated , which shows that the squashed effect and the cosmological rotational effect changes behavior of quasinormal modes .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to study the strong gravitational lensing in the neutral squashed kaluza - klein gdel black hole and to see what effects of the cosmological rotation and compactness of the extra dimension on the coefficients and the observables of gravitational lensing in the strong field limit .",
    "the plan of our paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",

    "the komar mass of the black hole is given by @xmath31 @xcite , where @xmath32 is the five - dimensional gravitational constant .",
    "since in the squashed kaluza - klein black hole spacetime the relationship between @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( the four - dimensional gravitational constant ) can be expressed as @xmath34 @xcite , one can obtain that the quantity @xmath35 .",
    "the relation between @xmath27 and @xmath36 is @xmath37 it is clear that the radius of the black hole event horizon @xmath27 decreases with increase of the gdel parameter @xmath4 .",

    ", one can get @xmath60 , which is consistent with that in the usual squashed kaluza - klein black hole spacetime @xcite .",
    "as @xmath28 approaches zero , the radius of the photon sphere becomes @xmath61 , which decreases with the gdel parameter @xmath4 . in fig.(1 ) , we set @xmath62 and plot the variety of the radius of the photon sphere @xmath63 with the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath28 .",
    "it shows that with the increase of @xmath28 , @xmath63 increases for the smaller @xmath4 and decreases for the larger @xmath4 . for fixed @xmath28 ,",
    "it is easy to obtain that @xmath63 decreases monotonically with the increase of the gdel parameter @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , it is well known that in the kerr black hole , the photon sphere radiuses are different for the photons winding in the same direction ( i.e. , @xmath64 ) or in the converse direction ( i.e. , @xmath65 ) of the black hole rotation @xcite .",
    "however , one can obtain that in the squashed kaluza - klein gdel black hole spacetime the photon sphere radius @xmath63 is independent of the sign of the gdel parameter @xmath4 since all of quantities @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 in eqs.([phs1 ] ) and ( [ phs111 ] ) are the function of @xmath69 .",
    "thus , the photon sphere radius in the black hole spacetime keeps the same whether the photon moves in the same or converse direction of the global rotation of the gdel universe .",
    "this means that the effects of the global rotation parameter @xmath4 of the gdel universe background on the gravitational lensing is different from that of the rotation parameter @xmath5 of the black hole itself .",

    "if @xmath73 is equal to the radius of the photon sphere @xmath63 , one can find that both of the deflection angles diverge , which means that the photon is captured by the black hole in this case .",
    "moreover , from eq.([int1 ] ) and ( [ int2 ] ) , one can find that in the squashed kaluza - klein gdel black hole spacetime both of the deflection angles depend on the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath28 , which implies that we could in theory detect the global rotation of the universe and the extra dimension through the gravitational lens .",
    "it is interesting to note that the integral @xmath74 is function of @xmath69 , which yields that the deflection angle @xmath78 is independent of whether the photon goes with or against the global rotation of the gdel universe .",
    "however , from eq .",
    "( [ int2 ] ) , we find that the integral @xmath75 contains the factor @xmath4 , and then the deflection angle @xmath79 for the photon traveling in the same direction as the global rotation of the gdel universe is different from that traveling in converse direction , which is similar to that of the deflection angle in the @xmath3 coordinate in the four - dimensional kerr black hole spacetime @xcite .",
    "the main reason is that in the equatorial plane @xmath38 the global rotation of the spacetime is in the @xmath71 direction rather than in the @xmath3 direction .",
    "as @xmath4 vanishes , one can find that the deflection angle of @xmath71 tends to zero since @xmath80 , which reduces to that of in the usual squashed kaluza - klein black hole spacetime @xcite .    here",
    "we will limit our attention to investigate the deflection angle in the @xmath3 direction for the light rays passing close to the black hole in the equatorial plane since it can be observed by astronomical experiments .",
    "moreover , it is very convenient for us to compare with the results obtained in the usual black hole spacetime .    defining a variable @xmath81",

    "moreover , the function @xmath85 in the small @xmath4 case is regular for all values of @xmath86 and @xmath73 . from eq.([ffq ] ) , one can find that the function @xmath87 diverges as @xmath86 tends to zero .",

    "<S> our result show that the strong gravitational lensing in the squashed kaluza - klein gdel black hole spacetime has some distinct behaviors from that in the kerr case . in the squashed kaluza - klein gdel black hole spacetime , the photon sphere radius , the minimum impact parameter , the coefficient @xmath0 , @xmath1 and the deflection angle @xmath2 in the @xmath3 direction are independent of whether the photon goes with or against the global rotation of the gdel universe . while in the kerr black hole , </S>",
    "<S> the values of these quantities for the prograde photons are different from those for the retrograde photons . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the coefficient of @xmath1 increases with @xmath4 in the squashed kaluza - klein gdel black hole , but decreases with @xmath5 in the kerr case . </S>",
    "<S> we also probe the influence of the squashed effect on the strong gravitational lensing in this black hole and find that in the extremely squashed case @xmath6 , the coefficient @xmath0 is a constant @xmath7 and is independent of the global rotation of the gdel universe . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we assume that the gravitational field of the supermassive central object of the galaxy can be described by this metric and estimate the numerical values of the coefficients and the main observables in the strong gravitational lensing .    </S>",
