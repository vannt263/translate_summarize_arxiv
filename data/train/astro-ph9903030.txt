    "brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) are luminous ellipticals found near the centres of galaxy clusters and groups .",
    "they are further subdivided into giant ellipticals ( ge ) , d galaxies which have shallower surface brightness profiles than ges , and finally cd galaxies which have extended low surface brightness envelopes ( mathews , morgan & schmidt 1964 ; schombert 1987 , 1988 ) .",
    "bcgs are often associated with powerful radio sources ( mathews _ et al .",
    "_ 1964 ) , and extended cluster x - ray emission ( jones _ et al .",
    "_ 1979 ) . in regular clusters ,",
    "bcgs are invariably at the centre of the cluster potential , as defined by the cluster x - ray emission , galaxy distributions , and strong / weak gravitational lensing ( e.g. miralda - escude 1995 ) , and their velocities are usually close to the mean cluster velocity .",
    "bcgs are often observed to have extremely high globular cluster specific frequencies ( e.g. harris , pritchet , & mcclure 1995 ; bridges _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) .",
    "the origin of bcg halos is one of the most puzzling aspects of galaxy formation , and it is unclear whether they are formed at the same time as the galaxy proper , as proposed by merritt ( 1984 ) , or are accreted later .",
    "if accreted later they might form via dissipational processes , such as star formation in cooling flows ( fabian & nulsen 1977 ) , or by purely stellar dynamical processes , such as galactic cannibalism ( hausman & ostriker 1978 ; mcglynn & ostriker 1980 ) , accretion of tidally stripped material ( richstone 1976 ) or `` galaxy harassment '' ( moore _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) . for a review of bcg formation ,",
    "see tremaine ( 1990 ) ; see also garijo , athanassoula , & garcia - gomez ( 1997 ) , and dubinski ( 1998 ) .",
    "the kinematics and metallicities of bcg halos provide important clues as to how they form .",
    "if they form in a dissipational process , then we might expect a low velocity dispersion , as the energy of the material from which the stars form has been radiated away .",
    "if bcgs form in a dissipative collapse , we would expect to see metallicity gradients in the halo ( though metallicity gradients are not unique to dissipative formation models ) .",
    "if the halos form out of material from other cluster galaxies via dissipationless processes , then we might expect the halos to reflect the kinematics of the cluster as a whole , with high velocity dispersion and little net rotation ; metallicity gradients would be shallower if bcgs experience significantly more mergers than other cluster galaxies , since mergers are expected to weaken metallicity gradients .",
    "if the halos are primordial , and formed in a process involving violent relaxation , then the kinematics will reflect the underlying mass distribution .",
    "while there is considerable information on the central kinematics of ellipticals , there have been few studies of the halo kinematics at very large radii from optical spectroscopy .",
    "most such studies have concentrated on normal ellipticals , and have found that the velocity dispersion profiles are either flat or decreasing with radius ( e.g. saglia _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ; carollo _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; statler , smecker - hane , & cecil 1996 ) .",
    "similar results have been found in the even fewer studies of bcgs ( e.g. carter _ et al .",
    "_ 1981 , 1985 ; tonry 1984 , 1985 ; heckman _ et al .",
    "_ 1985 ; fisher , illingworth , & franx 1995 ) . to date ,",
    "one cd ( ic 1101 in abell 2029 : dressler 1979 ; fisher _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; sembach & tonry 1996 ) , and two dumbell galaxies ( abell 3266 : carter _ et al .",
    "_ 1985 , and ic 2082 : carter _ et al .",
    "_ 1981 ) , have been found to have _ rising _ dispersion profiles .",
    "an alternative approach to the study of the kinematics of the outer halos of cd and other galaxies is the use of globular clusters and planetary nebulae as tracers . because of the geometric constraints of current multi - slit and fibre fed spectrographs",
    ", this technique can be used only in the outer halos , and because of magnitude limits can not be applied at distances beyond two or three times the distance of the virgo cluster . nevertheless for m87 ( mould _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 ; cohen & ryzhov 1997 ) and ngc 1399 ( grillmair _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ; kissler - patig _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ; minniti _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , globular cluster velocities have shown conclusively that the m / l ratio increases outwards in the halo , and thus that there are substantial dark matter halos in both galaxies .",
    "( 1994 ) confirm this result for ngc 1399 for a sample of planetary nebulae .",
    "interestingly , cohen & ryzhov ( 1997 ) find that the globular cluster velocity dispersion in m87 rises outwards , and in ngc 1399 the velocity dispersions of the planetary nebulae and globular clusters match smoothly onto the velocity dispersion of the fornax cluster itself .",
    "these bcgs at least seem to merge smoothly into their host clusters , and the bcg and cluster dynamics seem closely linked ( see discussion in freeman 1997 ) .",
    "the evidence from the distribution of lensed arcs in more distant clusters points to the dark matter being more centrally concentrated than the x - ray gas ( miralda - escude & babul 1995 ) . in this case",
    "the dark matter will affect the dynamics of the cd halo significantly .",
    "we have embarked on a program to obtain very deep optical spectroscopy of bcgs . here",
    "we present long - slit spectra for ngc 6166 , ngc 6173 , and ngc 6086 , obtained at the 2.5 m int in la palma in may 1996 .",
    "the properties of these galaxies and their host clusters are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "ngc 6166 is a luminous cd and a classic multiple - nucleus galaxy ( though the ` nuclei ' are probably not bound to ngc 6166 ) , centrally located in a rich cluster with a large cooling flow ( @xmath9 160 m@xmath10/yr :   allen & fabian 1997 ) , and a regular , symmetrical x - ray appearance ( buote & canizares 1996 ) .",
    "abell 2197 is 1.3 degrees north of abell 2199 ( gregory & thompson 1984 ) , and is a sparser cluster with an irregular x - ray morphology dominated by two main concentrations ( muriel , bohringer , & voges 1996 ) .",
    "ngc 6173 is a d galaxy found at the centre of one of these concentrations ( subclusters ) , and appears to have a significant peculiar velocity ( i.e. relative to the cluster mean velocity ) .",
    "abell 2162 is probably best described as a poor cluster or compact group ; we have not been able to find any x - ray data for this cluster .",
    "however , ngc 6086 is classified as a cd galaxy based on its surface brightness profile , and does not have a peculiar velocity .",

    "however , they are useful for identifying structures in the residuals of the model fit to the data",
    ". we measure and plot gauss - hermite parameters up to 6 .",
    "the observed wavelength range is well known to give template mismatch problems ( van der marel & franx 1993 ) . in order to minimize template mismatch ,",
    "an optimal stellar template is employed for the direct fitting .",
    "this is estimated as the best linear combination of the 28 template spectra which when broadened with a gaussian profile minimizes @xmath22 , the difference between the combination and the galaxy spectrum , after an initial guess of the velocity for each template and the dispersion , ( rix & white 1992 ) .",
    "this optimal template is then used for recovering the losvd for the galaxy spectrum , modelled up to 6 .",
    "this procedure is done for each of the individual spectra in each galaxy , thus reducing radial template mismatch due to abundance gradients .",
    "the galaxy nucleus is located by a gaussian fit to the light profile of the central few pixels .",
    "monte carlo experiments show that 2500 counts / pixel or higher gives satisfactory results for the direct fitting ( see appendix a ) .",
    "our procedure allows the determination of an individual optimal composite template for each data point , to ensure that this procedure does not introduce systematic effects into our profiles we repeated the analysis for ngc 6166 using the composite template for the central spectrum for all data points .",
    "there are no systematic differences in zeropoint or overall trend in any of the kinematic values derived .",
    "subjectively , we estimate that the scatter is higher , justifying our decision to use individually determined optimal templates",
    ".    emission lines could affect the measurement of absorption - line indices if they fall within one of the bandpasses , and also can potentially introduce systematics in the absorption line profile analysis .",
    "significant [ oiii ] and [ ni ] emission are observed in the nuclear region @xmath23 of ngc 6166 , but not in ngc 6173 or ngc 6086 .",

    "these regions are : @xmath24@xmath25 ( [ oiii ] ) , @xmath26@xmath27 ( [ ni ] ) , and @xmath28@xmath29 ( strong sky line ) .",
    "experimentation shows that excluding a few pixels has a negligible effect on the recovery of the losvd as kinematics are measured over the entire spectrum .",
    "for spectra more than 11 arcsec from the nucleus where no emission is present , only the region affected by the strong sky line is excluded , allowing fitting over the entire spectrum .",
    "another difficulty with ngc 6166 is the presence of companion nucleus b , which is at a pa of 62with respect to the central cd , and contributes significantly to the light in our slit between @xmath9 5@xmath1520 arcsec from the galaxy centre along the ne side .",
    "kinematics was not designed to recover two losvds , so we restrict our analysis to the sw side of the galaxy .",

    "ngc 6173 and ngc 6086 both show evidence of rotation in the core , decoupled from the kinematic properties further out . in ngc 6173 ( figure  [ fig : hermplot](b ) ) , a linear least - squares fit gives a velocity gradient of @xmath152.56 @xmath30 0.27 km s@xmath0 arcsec@xmath0 for @xmath31 arcsec , with no significant rotation outside this , and in ngc 6086 ( figure  [ fig : hermplot](c ) ) , similar fits give a velocity gradient of 0.86 @xmath30 0.48 km s@xmath0 arcsec@xmath0 for @xmath32 arcsec and @xmath151.33 @xmath30 0.13 km s@xmath0 arcsec@xmath0 for @xmath33 arcsec .",
    "although the core rotation is only marginally significant , it does appear to be counter - rotating .",
    "ngc 6173 is a shell galaxy , and both the shells and higher core rotation could be a result of a merger or interaction .",
    "however , in both galaxies , there is no significant asymmetry in the line profiles ( i.e. changes in @xmath34 ) associated with the peculiar kinematics , as expected from classical kdcs like ic 1459 or ngc 2865 ( hau , carter , & balcells 1998 ) .",
    "also , statler ( 1991 ) proposes that kdcs might also arise from streaming in a triaxial potential , without a merger / interaction .      the parameter @xmath1 measures symmetric deviations from a gaussian profile and is related to the velocity anisotropy .",

    "the most important result from the line - profile analysis is that there is no change in @xmath1 associated with the rising dispersion in ngc  6166 , indicating that the increase in velocity dispersion is not associated with a change in velocity anisotropy towards tangential orbits .",
    "@xmath1 has a magitude of 0.10 , 0.05 & 0.05 in ngc  6166 , 6173 & 6086 respectively .",

    "inspection of the residuals for ngc 6166 shows that the fits are less perfect than for the other two galaxies , but are satisfactory .",
    "we feel that template mismatch is not a major problem for all three galaxies as the optimal template is estimated from 28 template stars .    in order to estimate the effect of template mismatch on the absolute value of @xmath1 ( and other kinematic parameters ) , in appendix a",
    "we derive the kinematic parameters for ngc 6166 for a range of individual templates .",
    "none of these templates fit the galaxy data as well as the optimal template . given an extreme range of templates , we find zero point differences of up to 0.1 in @xmath1 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 ; 0.2 in @xmath34 , and 50 km / s in velocity dispersion .",
    "however these differences are largely in the zero points for stars at the extreme end of the range of spectral types of the observed templates ( g6 iii and m1 iii ) .",
    "in particular low @xmath1 is found only when an m1 iii template is used , this template does not fit the data well and contributes little to the optimal composite templates . although template mismatch may in principle shift the zero - point in @xmath1 , it can not explain the significantly positive @xmath1 seen in our data .    in appendix",

    "van der marel & franx ( 1993 ) give formulae which relate @xmath1 to @xmath21 , but they are model - dependent .",

    "the results are plotted in figure  [ fig : gaskin ] , with the stellar rotation curve from figure  [ fig : hermplot](a ) over - plotted .",

    "we discuss the significance of these results in our conclusions . as discussed in appendix b , there is some uncertainty regarding the zero - point of our measured indices in the lick / ids scale , due to the fact that only one star with lick indices ( hr 5227 ) has been observed , and also that the grating settings for the galaxy and the template star observations were different .",
    "however recent observations by trager _",
    "( 1998 ) for the nucleii of ngc 6166 and ngc 6086 do agree within their admittedly rather large error bars .",
    "we also find that our 2 g measurements agree well with those measured by cardiel _",

    "notice further from figure  [ fig : fevsmg2 ] that ngc 6086 and ngc 6166 are more ` enhanced ' than ngc 6173 .",
    "this is interesting , given that the first two galaxies are centrally - located cds , while ngc 6173 is best described as a ge in a subcluster in abell 2197 . similarly , m87 is offset from the non - bcgs in the data of davies , sadler , & peletier .",
    "hau ( 1998 ) has pointed out that in galaxies of high velocity dispersion , a positive value of @xmath1 , such as might result from radial anisotropy , leads to more absorption being lost from the passband that the fe indices are measured from , and thus to an artificially high value of [ mg / fe ] .",
    "this systematic error might account for as much as a third of the offset between ngc 6166 and ngc 6173 .",
    "however we still find that our galaxies with cd morphology have higher [ mg / fe ] compared with ngc 6173 , which is the only normal bright elliptical in our sample . if further observations confirm that ngc 6173 is typical ( despite uncertainty in the relative zero - points , the data of davies _ et al . _",
    "( 1993 ) support this ) , then there is a difference between cds and normal bright ellipticals .",
    "bender ( 1996 ) uses the offset of [ mg / fe ] to higher values in ellipticals when compared with spirals as an argument against the idea that ellipticals form from the mergers of objects similar to _ present - day _ spirals ; any such argument is clearly stronger for cds .",
    "bender ( 1996 ) and davies ( 1996 ) feel that the most plausible explanation for the non - solar [ mg / fe ] ratios in ellipticals is a short burst of star formation , @xmath45 1@xmath152 gyr .",
    "this would produce a population enriched in mg from rapid type ii supernovae from massive stars , while few stars would be formed from fe - enriched gas formed in longer - lived type ia supernovae .",
    "see section 6 for further discussion on these topics .",
    "we first compare our mg@xmath7 profile for ngc 6166 with that of cardiel _ et al . _",
    "( 1997 ) in figure  [ fig : uscardiel ] .",
    "we have only plotted the sw side of the major axis because of contamination from the secondary nucleus on the ne side .",
    "neither set of data has had any zeropoint corrections applied ( see appendix b ) . out to @xmath9 15 arcsec",
    ", the agreement is very good . beyond 15 arcsec ,",
    "our 2 g is significantly higher than that of cardiel _ et al . _",
    "the source of this discrepancy is unclear , however our signal - to - noise is higher than that of cardiel _ et al .",
    "_ their three outermost points have 2 g values @xmath45 0.2 , lower than any of the ellipticals studied by davies _",
    "these extreme values seem unlikely , and we are confident of the reliability of our 2 g profiles .",
    "the sensitivity of our line strength measurements to sky subtraction errors needs to be considered .",
    "the sky spectrum that we subtract is averaged over many spatial pixels and is relatively low noise .",
    "the only feature in the sky spectrum are the night sky emission line at 5577 and ( much weaker ) 5199 , apart from this the sky is well represented by a constant continuum . at these redshifts",
    "the [ ni ] line at 5199 does not fall in the 2 g band or its continuum bands , and so can be neglected .",
    "therefore the sky in the region of all of the line and continuum bandpasses can be represented by a constant , and the error in this constant can be determined from the maximum residuals seen in the [ oi ] line at 5577 in the sky subtracted spectra , and the ratio of the peak intensity in this line to the continuum in the sky spectra .",
    "inspection of the sky line residuals in the outer regions of our profile show that sky subtraction errors do not exceed 1% of the signal level , thus systematic errors in our 2 g values will not exceed 0.01 mag .    in figure",
    "[ fig : mg2prof ] , we present the major axis profiles of 2 g , for ngc 6166 , 6173 , and 6086 . outside",
    "35 arcsec , the 2 g profiles are well - fit by power - laws of slope ( d(2g)/d(log @xmath47 ) ) @xmath150.080 , @xmath150.059 , and @xmath150.073 for ngc 6166 , 6086 and 6173 respectively ( inside 3 arcsec , seeing effects are likely to be important ; the flattening of 2 g in ngc 6166 within a larger radius of @xmath9 5 arcsec may be due to star formation inside the emission - line region in this galaxy ) .",
    "these slopes are fairly similar to each other , and are also similar to the average 2 g slope of @xmath150.058 found by cardiel _",
    "( 1997 ) for eight bcgs without cooling flows or optical emission lines .",
    "gorgas , efstathiou , & aragon - salamanca ( 1990 ) also measured shallower gradients for two bcgs ( @xmath150.051 and @xmath150.021 for the cds in 0559 - 40 and pks 2354 - 35 ) .",
    "however , examination of their figure 9 shows that these gradients are based on only three points , and the outermost point in each case has large uncertainty .",
    "cardiel _ et al . _",
    "( 1997 ) find that the 2 g slopes are shallower in bcgs with optical line - emission , inside the emission - line region ; our data for ngc 6166 are consistent with this .",
    "_ attribute this flattening to star formation from cooling flow gas near the galaxy centre .",
    "this makes comparison of bcg 2 g data difficult , unless one is careful to compare slopes outside emission - line regions in all cases .",
    "we can also compare our 2 g slopes with those of non - bcg ellipticals .",
    "couture & hardy ( 1988 ) found a mean 2 g gradient of @xmath150.053 @xmath30 0.015 for six early - type galaxies ; davies , sadler , & peletier ( 1993 ) find a mean slope of @xmath150.059 @xmath30 0.022 for 13 normal ellipticals ; gorgas _ et al . _",
    "( 1990 ) obtain a mean slope of @xmath150.058 @xmath30 0.027 for 16 ellipticals ; davidge ( 1992 ) found a steeper gradient of @xmath150.081 @xmath30 0.01 for 11 ellipticals .",
    "gonzalez & gorgas ( 1998 ; see also gonzalez & gorgas 1997 ) find a mean 2 g gradient of @xmath150.055 @xmath30 0.025 for 109 early - type galaxies .",
    "thus , our three bcgs have slopes consistent with those found in non - bcg ellipticals .",
    "it seems likely that these bcgs have not experienced significantly more mergers than normal ellipticals , as mergers are expected to dilute abundance gradients ( white 1980 ) .",
    "_ our main results are : _    * ( 1 ) :  * we find small rotation along the major axes of ngc 6166 , ngc 6173 , and n6086 , with v@xmath48 @xmath49 50 km s@xmath0 at the outermost observed major axis radii ( 3040 arcsec ) in the three galaxies ; the corresponding v/@xmath18 ranges from 0.020.18 .",
    "this small rotation is consistent with the nearly complete lack of rotation found near the centres of a sample of 13 bcgs by fisher _",
    "this is consistent with merger models of bcg formation , but data at larger radii are urgently needed , since numerical simulations predict that mergers should contain significant amounts of angular momentum beyond 2@xmath153 r@xmath50 ( e.g. hernquist 1993 ) .",
    "ngc 6173 and ngc 6086 have larger velocity gradients near the galaxy centres , and ngc 6086 appears to have a counter - rotating core .",
    "these cores may arise from a previous merger / interaction ( supported by the shells seen in ngc 6173 ) , or may be due to streaming in a triaxial potential ; further observations at other position angles will be needed to decide between these two alternatives ( statler 1991 ) .    * ( 2 ) :  * ngc 6086 and ngc 6173 have slowly declining velocity dispersion profiles .",
    "in contrast , ngc 6166 has a rising velocity dispersion : @xmath18 increases from @xmath9 325 km s@xmath0 at the centre to @xmath9 440 km s@xmath0 at 35 .    *",
    "( 3 ) :  * the gauss - hermite 4 moment is positive and roughly constant at 0.05 at all radii along the major axis of ngc 6173 and ngc 6086 , and 0.1 along the major axis of ngc 6166 .",
    "template mismatch is unlikely to account for all of this offset , and we conclude that there is possibly radial anisotropy present",
    ". we will confirm and quantify this suggestion with detailed modelling in a later paper .    *",
    "( 4 ) :  * we find [ oiii ] and [ ni ] emission concentrated within 5 arcseconds ( 3h@xmath0 kpc ) of the centre of ngc 6166 , with a central velocity dispersion of @xmath9 350 km s@xmath0 , similar to the central stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "the extent of the [ oiii ] emission region is unresolved , but that of the [ ni ] may be marginally resolved .    *",
    "( 5 ) :  * we find that [ mg / fe ] is larger in ngc 6166 and ngc 6086 than in ngc 6173 .",
    "although positive @xmath1 can lead to systematic errors in [ mg / fe ] , the magnitude of the offset appears too large to be explained by such an error .",
    "the difference in [ mg / fe ] between galaxies with cd morphology and normal bright ellipticals , if confirmed by further observations , would present a difficulty for models in which the cds were formed from mergers of normal galaxies of any type .    *",
    "( 6 ) :  * the 2 g gradients outside 35 arcsec range from @xmath150.06 to @xmath150.08 for the three galaxies .",
    "these slopes are consistent with those found for bcgs without cooling flows or emission lines by cardiel _",
    "( 1997 ) , and for non - bcg ellipticals .",
    "more data are needed to definitively compare bcgs with non - bcg ellipticals in this regard .",
    "we defer to a forthcoming paper a detailed dynamical modelling of these three galaxies , but we note that ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) together imply that the m / l ratio increases outwards in the ngc 6166 halo , and likely in the other two galaxies as well . further support for a dm halo in ngc",
    "6166 comes from x - ray data , e.g. buote & canizares ( 1996 ) .",
    "do these results favour one bcg formation model over others ?",
    "there are five main scenarios for bcg formation : * ( i ) *   deposition of cooling flow gas from the icm ( e.g. fabian 1994 ) ; * ( ii ) *  cannibalism of other cluster galaxies ( ostriker & tremaine 1975 ) ; * ( iii )  * tidal stripping of other cluster galaxies , either by the cluster tidal field or by the bcg itself ( richstone 1976 ; moore _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) ; * ( iv )  * earlier origin in smaller groups / subclusters , which later merged to form the present - day cluster ( merritt 1984 , 1985 ; tremaine 1990 ) ; and * ( v )  * dissipative collapse models ( larson 1975 ; carlberg 1984a , b ) .",
    "these scenarios are not necessarily mutually exclusive ; for instance , many authors have suggested that mergers / cannibalism create the central body of the cd , while tidal stripping accounts for their extended halos .",
    "dubinski ( 1998 ) has run an impressive simulation of cd formation , using a large cosmological n - body simulation of cluster collapse with hierarchical merging .",
    "his ` cluster ' has a mass of 1.0 @xmath51 10@xmath52 m@xmath10 and a line - of - sight velocity dispersion of 550 km s@xmath0 , and he notes that it would be classified as a poor cluster or large group by observers .",
    "he finds that the final central giant elliptical has a small rotation of @xmath9 50 km s@xmath0 , is radially anisotropic in the outer regions , is aligned in position angle with the ` cluster ' galaxy distribution , and has a slowly declining major - axis velocity dispersion profile .",
    "these properties agree with those observed in many bcgs , including our sample described in this paper .",
    "all three of our galaxies have little or no rotation , and have significantly positive @xmath1 values which generally indicate radial anisotropy .",
    "ngc 6086 and ngc 6173 have velocity dispersion profiles similar to dubinski s remnant , and ngc 6173 and ngc 6166 are aligned ( to within 20 degrees ) of their host cluster / subcluster galaxy distributions and x - ray isophotes ( carter & metcalfe 1980 ; dixon , godwin , & peach 1989 ; muriel , bohringer , & voges 1996 ; buote & canizares 1996 ) .",
    "however , more such simulations are needed to see if , among other things , remnants with increasing dispersion profiles and extended halos can be created .",
    "garijo , athanassoula , & garcia - gomez ( 1997 ) have run a larger set of simulations of cd formation , with a variety of initial conditions .",
    "some of the simulations produce objects with extended halos and radial anisotropy , and all of the final galaxies have declining velocity dispersion profiles .",
    "note , however , that these simulations were run with all of the mass initially bound to galaxies , probably not physically realistic .",
    "the radial anisotropy found by both authors is a result of the ` cosmological ' mergers that are being modelled , where the initial filamentary structure means that merging galaxies enter the central object on mainly radial orbits .",
    "further constraints can be placed on formation models if one considers the stellar abundance gradients .",
    "our three galaxies all show modest gradients , comparable with normal bright ellipticals ( e.g. davies , sadler , & peletier 1993 ) .",
    "these gradients are not as steep as predicted by simple dissipational collapse models ( e.g. larson 1975 ) , however they are steeper than we would expect from hierarchical dissipationless merger models , which predict no gradients .",
    "it is not clear what the net effect of gaseous mergers will be , since on the one hand mergers are expected to dilute existing abundance gradients ( white 1980 ) , while on the other hand central star formation induced by the merger could augment any gradient ( see for instance mihos & hernquist 1994 ) . in any case",
    "the gradients point to a formation history not too different from that of normal bright ellipticals .    the [ mg / fe ] ratio in ngc 6166 and ngc 6086 , and the difference between these two bcgs and ngc 6173 , provide important new clues as to the differences between cds and normal bright ellipticals .",
    "if this difference is confirmed by further observations , this is a second property , alongside the globular cluster specific frequency , in which ellipticals differ from spirals and in which cds are even more extreme .",
    "fisher _ et al . _",
    "( 1995 ) and bender ( 1996 ) find that [ mg / fe ] is correlated with velocity dispersion , so perhaps the large [ mg / fe ] offsets seen in our bcgs are simply the continuation of this correlation to the largest measured velocity dispersions .",
    "the trend of increasing [ mg / fe ] we see in our three bcgs ( figure 4 ) does agree with their relative velocity dispersions .",
    "a dissipative process is most likely to give rise to these differences , although mergers as a trigger for such a process can not be ruled out ; for instance zepf and ashman ( 1993 ) interpret the bimodal colour ( and hence metallicity ) distributions for globular clusters in some elliptical galaxies , including the bcgs m87 and ngc 1399 , as evidence for a second , merger induced , epoch of cluster formation .",
    "if we had data for ngc 6166 and ngc 6173 alone , it would be tempting to draw a clear distinction between the two galaxies .",
    "ngc 6166 has a rising velocity dispersion , and enhanced [ mg / fe ] , a high globular cluster specific frequency ( bridges _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) and an x  ray cooling flow .",
    "ngc 6173 has none of these things , yet is a galaxy with a similar luminosity and surface brightness profile ( carter 1977 ) .",
    "ngc 6086 appears to have a mixture of properties : it has a high [ mg / fe ] , yet does not have a rising dispersion profile .",
    "it is important to establish which of these properties depend upon the environment of a galaxy , and similar observations of galaxies with cd morphology in low density environments ( such as ngc 4839 ; oemler 1976 ) are required .",
    "it is not clear how to interpret the rising velocity dispersion profile that we observe in ngc 6166 .",
    "one would expect a rising dispersion profile under any model of bcg formation , since under simple energy arguments the bcg dispersion profile should eventually join that of the cluster as a whole ( as is the case for ngc 1399/fornax ; see section 1 ) . however , we note that the three bcgs with increasing dispersions , and where x  ray data for the cluster exist ( ngc 6166 , ic 1101 , abell 3266 ) are all in rich clusters with smooth x - ray morphology . there is no evidence for substructure or peculiar bcg velocities in any of these clusters .",
    "we suggest that these are old , relaxed clusters in which the bcg is at the centre of the cluster potential ; these are the sorts of clusters in which it will be most profitable to search for bcgs with increasing velocity dispersions , in order to study the transition between the bcg and the cluster .",
    "we thank hans - walter rix for the use of his program for absorption line profile analysis , and for extensive advice on this subject .",
    "we would also like to thank nicolas cardiel , javier gorgas , alfonso aragn - salamanca , reynier peletier , jim schombert and an anonymous referee for comments on various aspects of this paper .",
    "thanks also to cardiel , gorgas , and aragn - salamanca for sharing their data with us prior to publication .",
