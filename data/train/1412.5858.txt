    "this is known to happen only in integrable nonlinear wave equations like the sine - gordon ( sg ) equation  @xcite and the nonlinear schrdinger equation  @xcite , or in nonlinear lattices  @xcite due to the occurrence of band gaps in the linear wave spectrum .",

    "sine - gordon breathers are localized in space and periodic in time and can be understood as the bound states of kink and anti - kink .",

    "the coupled becs may thus provide an experimentally accessible model to simulate the evolution of the early universe  @xcite .",
    "while recent works on simulating the sg model using coupled becs have focussed entirely on the relative phase dynamics  @xcite , this picture neglects the coupling to the symmetric degrees of freedom in the system , such as the total phase and densities of the condensates . realistically",
