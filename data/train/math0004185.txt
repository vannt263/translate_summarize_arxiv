    "every solution of ( 1.4 ) lying on the invariant torus @xmath349 has the form @xmath350 , where @xmath351 is the initial value .",
    "it is necessary and sufficient to prove the existence of a @xmath351 such that @xmath352 thus it is sufficient to prove that the limit value @xmath353 exists . since @xmath354 it is sufficient to prove that the obtained integral converges . by ( a4 ) we have @xmath355 there is a constant @xmath356 such that @xmath357 for @xmath358 .",

    "first of all we notice that @xmath361 since @xmath362 , it satisfies the lipschitz inequality with some constant @xmath363 ( on such a compact set @xmath250 from @xmath73 that @xmath364 for @xmath365 ) @xmath366 it follows from ( 5.2 ) and ( 5.3 ) that @xmath367 .",

    "changing the variables by the formulas @xmath375 ( action - angle coordinates ) we transform ( 5.4 ) into @xmath376 and ( 5.5 ) into @xmath377 the solutions of ( 5.6 ) are @xmath378 @xmath379 and those of ( 5.7 ) are @xmath380,$ ] @xmath381\\,ds.$ ] obviously , @xmath382 but @xmath383 from proof of theorem 5.1 does not exist .",

    "suppose @xmath387 is a constant . for system ( 1.1 )",
    "it is equivalent to @xmath388 it means that each subsystem @xmath76 in ( 1.1 ) , @xmath389 defines an isochronous centre . for ( 1.5 ) we can also talk about a property of isochronicity .",
    "then the statements of theorems 5.15.2 are valid for @xmath390 indeed , we have in this case @xmath391 where convergence of this integral follows from ( 5.1 ) .    the property of isochronicity in hamiltonian systems ( and not only for such systems ) is discussed in numerous papers .",

    "our note 5.2 is valid .",
    "we note that the main reason of appearance of the condition @xmath49 is just the necessity to estimate @xmath392 .",

    "finally we point out a possibility of the situation for system ( 1.1 ) when some subsystems of it are isochronous centres and all other not .",
    "it is not difficult to see that for `` isochronous '' angles @xmath165 the orbital convergence ( _ note : _ even usual convergence ) is realized in theorem 4.4 .",
