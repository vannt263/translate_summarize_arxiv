    "the discovery of the higgs boson is the most important goal of modern particle physics .",
    "the inclusive production cross sections for @xmath2 and @xmath3 have been calculated a long time ago at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in perturbation theory @xcite , and since a few years results at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) are available @xcite .",
    "inclusive higgs - boson production is thus one of the best studied processes from a theoretical perspective .    in view of this fact , it is uncomfortable that the behavior of qcd perturbation theory appears to be rather poor in this case .",
    "the @xmath0-factor for higgs - boson production , defined as the prediction for the cross section normalized to the born approximation , takes surprisingly large values . for the production of a light higgs boson ( @xmath4gev ) at the lhc",
    ", one typically finds @xmath51.9 at nlo and @xmath62.2 at nnlo . also , the residual dependence on the renormalization and factorization scales remains significant even at nnlo . the standard argument that the large @xmath0-factor results from the accessibility of new production channels beyond the leading order , such as @xmath7 and @xmath8 , does not apply in this case , as these contributions to the cross section are known to be below 10% .",
    "also , the @xmath0-factor is not much reduced by soft - gluon resummation near the partonic threshold @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we show that the bulk of the large perturbative corrections to higgs - boson production via gluon - gluon fusion originate from terms of the form @xmath1 arising from the analytic continuation of the gluon form factor to time - like momentum transfer , and that these terms exponentiate to leading order .",
    "the higgs - boson production cross section at hadron colliders such as the tevatron or lhc is dominated by the gluon - gluon fusion process @xmath9 via a top - quark loop . for a not too heavy higgs boson ,",
    "this process is well approximated by the effective local interaction @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11gev is the higgs vacuum expectation value , and the short - distance coefficient @xmath12 is known to nnlo @xcite and has a well behaved perturbative expansion for @xmath13 .",
    "the production cross section is related to the discontinuity of the product of two such effective vertices .",
    "it can be written as the convolution of a hard - scattering kernel with parton distribution functions .",
    "the large corrections we identify are due to virtual corrections to the effective @xmath14 interaction ( [ heff ] ) and arise from quantum corrections characterized by the scale @xmath13 .",
    "these effects are described by a universal factor and affect differential distributions in same way as the total cross section .",
    "they can be factorized into a hard function @xmath15 , which is the square of the on - shell gluon form factor evaluated at time - like momentum transfer @xmath16 , and with infrared divergences subtracted using the @xmath17 scheme @xcite . on a technical level",
    ", the hard function appears as a wilson coefficient in the matching of the two - gluon operator in ( [ heff ] ) onto an operator in soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite , in which all hard modes have been integrated out .",
    "this matching takes the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is ( minus ) the square of the total momentum carried by the operator .",
    "the fields @xmath20 and @xmath21 are effective , gauge - invariant gluon fields in scet @xcite .",
    "they describe gluons propagating along the two light - like directions @xmath22 defined by the colliding hadrons .",
    "the two - loop expression for the wilson coefficient @xmath23 can be extracted from the results of @xcite .",
    "we write @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "the one - loop coefficient reads @xmath26 and the result for the two - loop coefficient can be found in @xcite .",
    "the hard function is given by the absolute square of the wilson coefficient at time - like momentum transfer , @xmath27 the wilson coefficient obeys an evolution equation , which reflects the renormalization properties of the effective two - gluon operator in scet .",
    "it reads @xcite @xmath28 c_s(q^2,\\mu^2 ) \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the cusp anomalous dimension of wilson lines with light - like segments in the adjoint representation of @xmath30 .",
    "it controls the leading sudakov double logarithms contained in @xmath23 and is known to three - loop order @xcite .",
    "the single - logarithmic evolution is controlled by the anomalous dimension @xmath31 , which can be extracted from the infrared divergences of the on - shell form factor @xcite .",
    "using results from @xcite it can be derived to three - loop order @xcite . the evolution equation ( [ csevol ] )",
    "links the coefficients of the logarithmic terms in ( [ csexp ] ) to coefficients in the perturbative expansions of the anomalous dimensions and the qcd @xmath32-function . at one - loop order",
    "we have @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the wilson coefficient at space - like momentum transfer has a well behaved expansion in powers of the coupling constant , if the renormalization scale is taken to be of order the natural scale , @xmath36 .",
    "for instance , with @xmath37 colors and @xmath38 light quark flavors , we find @xmath39 the nature of the expansion changes drastically when the same coefficient is evaluated at time - like momentum transfer @xmath40 .",
    "we then obtain @xmath41 the expansion coefficients are more than an order of magnitude larger than in the space - like region .",
    "the origin of this effect is that the sudakov ( double ) logarithms contained in the coefficients @xmath42 in ( [ csexp ] ) give rise to @xmath43 terms when we analytically continue @xmath44 .",
    "for the hard function entering the higgs - boson production cross section , this implies @xmath45 where the numerical estimates in the last line refer to the nlo and nnlo corrections for a higgs - boson mass of 120gev , and we use @xmath46 as our normalization of the running coupling constant .",
    "these hard matching corrections account for the bulk of the @xmath0-factors found at nlo and nnlo .",
    "the large expansion coefficients in the perturbative series for the wilson coefficient in the time - like region can be avoided if we evaluate this coefficient at a _ time - like _ renormalization point , in which case ( here and below , negative arguments of the running coupling are always understood with a @xmath47 prescription ) @xmath48 with @xmath49 and the _ same _ expansion coefficients as in ( [ csexp ] ) .",
    "we then obtain @xmath50 instead of ( [ csbad ] ) .",

    "the running coupling is evaluated at time - like momentum transfer @xmath52 .",
    "the function @xmath53 in perturbation theory is analytic in the complex @xmath54 plane with a ( physical ) cut on the negative real axis and a ( unphysical ) landau pole at @xmath55 .",
    "since we are interested in very large @xmath56 values , the landau pole is not of concern to our discussion .",
    "the definition @xmath57 of the qcd @xmath32-function implies that @xmath58 and this relation allows us to define the running coupling at time - like argument in terms of that at space - like momentum transfer . at nlo",
    "we obtain @xmath59 + { \\cal o}(\\alpha_s^2 ) \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath60 . in standard applications of the renormalization group",
    "one would count this quantity as an @xmath61 parameter . since numerically @xmath62 , it is however also reasonable to count @xmath63 .",
    "what is needed for the calculation of the higgs - boson production cross section is the wilson coefficient at positive , not negative @xmath54 , see ( [ hdef ] ) .",
    "we will use the solution to the renormalization - group equation ( [ csevol ] ) to relate this coefficient to the one in ( [ ctimelike ] ) . in that way the large corrections arising in the time - like region are resummed to all orders in perturbation theory .",

    "the convergence of the expansion and the residual scale dependence at nlo and nnlo are much improved by the resummation .",
    "the new lo and nlo bands almost coincide with the nlo and nnlo bands in fixed - order perturbation theory , and the new nnlo band is now fully contained inside the nlo band .",
    "the cross section for the drell - yan process receives the same type of @xmath43-enhanced corrections as the higgs - boson production cross section , however in this case no anomalously large @xmath0-factors arise at nlo and nnlo .",
    "let us briefly discuss why this is the case .",
    "the vector - current matching coefficient @xmath87 appearing in the drell - yan case is defined in analogy with @xmath23 in ( [ csdef ] ) , but with the two - gluon operator replaced by the electromagnetic current @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "it obeys an evolution equation of the same structure as ( [ csevol ] ) , in which the cusp anomalous dimension in the adjoint representation is replaced by that in the fundamental representation , and in which an anomalous dimension @xmath89 replaces @xmath31 .",
    "the cusp anomalous dimensions are simply related by @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "the one - loop coefficient of @xmath89 is @xmath91 .",
    "the resummation of @xmath43-enhanced terms is accomplished as in ( [ hresummed ] ) , where in the explicit forms of the evolution function the appropriate expansion coefficients must be used .    the one - loop matching contribution to",
    "the wilson coefficient @xmath87 reads @xmath92 which has the same structure as ( [ c1general ] ) .",
    "however , the leading @xmath43-enhanced terms in drell - yan production are smaller than those in higgs - boson production by a factor 4/9 , and the constant @xmath93 in the matching condition ( [ cvres ] ) , which is absent in the higgs case , has the effect of partially compensating the large , positive @xmath43 terms resulting from the analytic continuation @xmath44 . this can also be seen by looking at some numerical values . for the squared coefficients at time - like momentum transfer , we obtain for @xmath94gev the perturbative expansions @xmath95 which should be compared with ( [ hres ] ) and ( [ cgood ] ) .",
    "while the convergence is better for @xmath96 , the large one - loop correction seen in the higgs case is absent for the reasons mentioned above .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the bulk of the perturbative corrections to the drell - yan cross section are related to @xmath43-enhanced terms in the ratio of the time - like to space - like sudakov form factors . in this paper",
    "a resummation formula was derived for the ratio of these form factors , which shares some similarities with our results ( [ beauty ] ) and ( [ ureexpanded ] ) . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", a corresponding analysis has not been performed for the higgs - boson production cross section .",
    "we expect that the approach based on effective field theory presented here can be adapted straightforwardly to other processes .",
    "we have shown that the large @xmath0-factor for higgs - boson production at hadron colliders results from a simple kinematical effect : the analytic continuation of the gluon form factor to time - like momentum transfer .",
    "this leads to large perturbative corrections of order @xmath1 , which can be resummed to all orders by solving a renormalization - group equation .",
    "our approach employs methods from effective field theory and properties of the qcd running coupling in the complex momentum plane .    after the resummation of the @xmath43-enhanced terms ,",
    "the @xmath0-factor for higgs - boson production at the lhc is reduced to a rather modest value of about 1.3 at both nlo and nnlo . a detailed analysis of the phenomenological consequences of our observation , combined with state - of - the - art results for nnlo corrections and soft - gluon resummation ,",
    "will be presented in a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "extensions of our approach to other hard - scattering processes with time - like momentum transfer , such as event shapes or @xmath97 production at hadron colliders , will be discussed elsewhere .",
