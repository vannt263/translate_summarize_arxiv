    "ground - state density - functional theory ( dft ) maps the interacting electronic problem into an effective non - interacting system , that shares with the real system the ground - state density and energy  @xcite . in the kohn - sham ( ks ) formulation of dft",
    "@xcite , the electrons are acted on by an effective single - particle , multiplicative potential , the ks potential .",
    "all the complicated many - body effects of the real system are fully included in this effective potential , whose crucial role is to do whatever is needed to reproduce the density and total energy of the real interacting system .",
    "the aim of the present work is to explore some of the unusual features of the exact ks potential , in particular its behavior when the system under study has a non - integer ( fractional ) number of electrons .",
    "there are several reasons why the analysis of systems with fractional charges within the dft framework may be of some interest .",
    "a good example is the behavior of the molecule @xmath2 , when stretched by increasing the distance between the two protons beyond the equilibrium separation . at the dissociation limit , and without any symmetry breaking , @xmath2 correctly splits in two identical fragments or open subsystems , each one consisting of a proton and half of one electron : @xmath3 .",
    "most of the local or semilocal energy functionals of common use in dft behave poorly in this limit of fractional occupancies , yielding energies far below the proper binding energy of 1 hartree , due to the tendency of approximate functionals to spread out the electron density artificially . in practical calculations ,",
    "the problem may be `` solved '' by breaking the spatial symmetry and localizing the electron on one of the two protons . proceeding this way ,",
    "the resulting binding energy of the @xmath2 molecule at its dissociation limit is reasonable , but the associated density is not correct . in exact dft , on the other side , the problem is solved by the condition that the energy of the two hydrogen - like fragments must be the same either if the electron is localized in one of the protons , or if there is half of one electron at each proton  @xcite .",
    "the same happens with all radical symmetric molecules @xmath4 at infinite bond length .",
    "this failure has been denoted the `` many - electron self - interaction error ''  @xcite or `` delocalization error ''  @xcite of semilocal functionals , and happens when some occupied ks orbitals share an electron between two open subsystems , equivalent to having in each subsystem a non - integer occupation number .",
    "a related situation occurs with many asymmetric molecules @xmath5 that with approximate functionals dissociate not to neutral atoms @xmath6 and @xmath7 but improperly to fractionally charged fragments @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "also , long - range charge transfers are usually overestimated  @xcite , and the energy barriers that control the reaction rates in chemical reactions are underestimated or even absent  @xcite .",
    "all these problematic issues of current dft may be related to specific missing features of the ks potential resulting from semilocal functionals .    from a rigorous point of view",
    ", the extension of the ground - state dft formalism to the case of systems whose density integrates to a fractional number was made in a seminal work by perdew _",
    "et al . _",
    "they proved , by introducing a zero - temperature ensemble dft formalism , that the total energy is a piecewise linear function of the electron number between two adjacent integers . in turn , this leads to the theoretical prediction of a discontinuity of the ks potential as the electron number passes through an integer .",
    "this abrupt jump of the exact ks potential , missed in all local or semilocal approximations , is on the other side the crucial ingredient that explains the severe underestimation of the fundamental band - gap of insulators and semiconductors  @xcite .",
    "all these issues have been discussed in the influential review of ref .",
    "[ ] ; for a more updated review , see ref .  [ ] .",
    "the aim of this work is to illustrate some of the non - intuitive features of the ks potential through the use of a simple but strongly correlated one - dimensional model of the hydrogen molecule , for which the exact interacting density is available for any electron number between 0 and 2 . by a reverse - engineering procedure , the @xmath0-dependent exact ks potential",
    "is then obtained from the @xmath0-dependent density .",
    "the simplicity of our model allow us to prove unambiguously an anomalous scaling of the correlation potential , with regard to the strength of the electron - electron repulsion .",
    "the present work is organized as follows : in section ii we introduce the model and explain the method we use for finding its solutions ; in section iii we provide the main numerical and analytical results , while section iv is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "the bottleneck of our reverse - engineering method is in finding the solution ( in principle exact ) of a @xmath9 closed shell diatomic molecule . as this is not easily available , and we are more interested in understanding the physics behind the ks potential than in describing a real tridimensional molecule , we will simplify the model . following ref .",
