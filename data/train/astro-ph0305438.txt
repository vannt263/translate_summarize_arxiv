    "while most of the interstellar gas mass in elliptical galaxies , typically @xmath0 @xmath1 , is at the galactic virial temperature @xmath2 k , the cores of @xmath3 percent of all large e galaxies contain dusty clouds of cold gas of mass @xmath4 @xmath1 ( e.g. van dokkum & franx 1995 ) .",
    "in addition , diffuse optical line emission from gas at @xmath5 k is observed in most or all elliptical galaxies within a few hundred parsecs from the center ( e.g. caon et al .",
    "2000 ) , particularly in those galaxies formerly thought to contain `` cooling flows . ''",
    "the notion that the hot gas cools to low temperatures is not supported by xmm spectra ( e.g. peterson et al .",
    "2001 ; xu et al .",
    "2001 ) , i.e. , the observed cooling rate @xmath6 is lower than that expected in traditional cooling flows ,",
    "@xmath7 @xmath1 yr@xmath8 . in any case , cooling of essentially dust - free hot gas can not produce dust clouds . in the following",
    "we propose that the dusty clouds are formed from gas expelled from evolving metal - rich red giant stars in e galaxy cores .",
    "even if these dusty stellar envelopes are heated to @xmath9 after leaving the stars , the gas can cool rapidly by collisions between thermal electrons and dust grains .",
    "direct evidence that mass is being lost from evolving stars in x - ray luminous ellipticals is provided by near - ir ( @xmath10 m ) observations of hot circumstellar dust ( knapp et al . 1989 , 1992 ; athey et al .",
    "the 9.7 @xmath11 m peak from ( oxygen - rich ) silicate grains apparent in iso observations places an upper limit on the grain radius , @xmath12 @xmath11 m ( figure 5 of laor & draine 1993 ) . according to athey et al .",
    ", the total luminosity of excess near - ir radiation is consistent with expected total stellar mass loss rates in giant e galaxies , @xmath7 @xmath1 yr@xmath8 .    however , as dusty gas moves away from orbiting , mass - losing red giant stars , it encounters the hot interstellar gas at @xmath13 kev and is violently disrupted by hydrodynamic instabilities .",
    "the interaction of the stellar wind / planetary nebula with the hot gas is extremely complicated , but this ejected gas can not remain at @xmath5 k for more than @xmath14 years without exceeding the typical h@xmath15 + [ nii ] luminosities observed ( mathews & brighenti 1999 ) .",
    "xmm spectra show no evidence for slowly heating gas at @xmath16 .",
    "this empirical evidence supports rapid thermal mixing of the stellar ejecta , which is probably a consequence of gasdynamical instabilities that enormously increase the surface area between the stellar ejecta and the ambient hot gas . in view of the complexity of this interaction ,",
    "the thermal evolution @xmath17 of gas ejected from stars is difficult to estimate , but limits can be set . in the following discussion",
    "we adopt a useful limiting assumption for @xmath17 : the dusty gas is rapidly heated to the temperature of the local hot gas with the dust intact .",
    "this assumption maximizes the likelihood that the stellar gas will remain thermally merged with the hot gas phase .",
    "grain sputtering during the rapid heating process is unlikely since the heating time must be @xmath18 , which is very much less than the sputtering time ( see below ) .",
    "as soon as the dusty gas is heated ( by assumption ) to the local gas temperature , it will begin to cool .",
    "cooling occurs by thermal x - ray emission from the gas and by inelastic impacts of thermal electrons with the grains .",
    "grain - electron cooling can greatly exceed that from thermal x - ray emission ( e.g. dwek 1987 ; dwek & arendt 1992 ) provided the grains are not sputtered away . if the cooling time is shorter than the dynamical time in the galactic potential , the gas will tend to cool approximately _ in situ _ , the case we consider here . during isobaric cooling",
    ", the gas temperature decreases according to @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the usual thermal radiation coefficient for gas with metallicity @xmath34 in solar units ( sutherland & dopita 1993 ) and @xmath35 is the coefficient for dust - induced cooling .",
    "the cooling of the hot plasma by grains is due mostly to inelastic impacts of thermal electrons with the grains .",
    "for high temperature plasmas , such as we consider , the rate of electron - grain collisions is unaffected by the grain charge ( draine & salpeter 1979 ) which we assume is regulated by emission of low energy electrons from the grain surface .",
    "an individual grain cools the local gas at a rate @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the mean energy and velocity of electrons , @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the grain radius in microns . at pressures of interest , @xmath41 , the plasma mean free path , @xmath42 cm , is small ;",
    "only electrons in the cooling regions collide with the grains ; electrons from the hot ambient gas thermalize in the cooling plasma before colliding with a grain . in ngc 4472 , a giant elliptical in the virgo cluster which we use for reference , @xmath43 @xmath44 so @xmath45 and @xmath46 at @xmath47 kpc and the effective radius @xmath48 kpc respectively .",
    "we adopt a distance of 17 mpc to ngc 4472 .",
    "grains can internally absorb the energy of thermal electrons provided @xmath49 kev ( dwek & werner 1981 ) , which we assume is generally satisfied .",
    "cooling by electron impact on grains during the sputtering time , @xmath50 yrs , greatly exceeds the additional gas cooling required to fully ionize the grain atoms ejected in the sputtering process or to bring these sputtered ions up to local thermal velocities .    at any moment",
    "the space density of interstellar grains @xmath51 in luminous elliptical galaxies is very inhomogeneous , being concentrated near mass - losing stars .",
    "if @xmath52 is the typical total mass of the stellar envelope ejected by evolving stars and @xmath53 gm @xmath44 is the density of ( silicate ) grains , then the total number of grains expelled by a single star is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the ratio of the dust mass to the gas mass when ejected from the stars .",
    "we assume that @xmath56 decreases with stellar metallicity as in ngc 4472 where @xmath57 in solar units ( brighenti & mathews 1999 ) .",
    "the initial space density of grains is proportional to the local gas density @xmath58 . as the gas cools isobarically from some initial temperature @xmath59 , the grain space density increases , @xmath60 ( \\mu p / k)/t$ ] . the dust cooling coefficient in equation 2 , @xmath61 ,",
    "is then @xmath62    to explore the influence of grain cooling we integrate equations 1 and 2 beginning with gas at temperature @xmath63 and pressure @xmath64 at galactic radius @xmath65 in the hot gaseous atmosphere of ngc 4472 .",
    "the pressure @xmath66 is constant during cooling . for simplicity , we assume the gas is filled with grains all having the same initial radius @xmath67 . as the gas cools the sputtered debris from the grains increases the metallicity of the gas phase . to evaluate the plasma cooling rate coefficient @xmath33 during the cooling",
    ", we assume that the gas phase metal abundance in solar units increases with decreasing grain mass ( @xmath68 ) , @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the maximum ratio of dust to gas mass if all elements heaver than he were in grains .",
    "we describe solutions of equations 1 and 2 for the elliptical galaxy ngc 4472 with initial conditions at radii @xmath47 and @xmath48 kpc . according to our assumption ,",
    "the dusty gas expelled from a star is rather quickly heated to the local temperature of the hot gas at these two galactic radii , @xmath71 and @xmath72 k , where the gas density is @xmath73 and @xmath74 @xmath44 respectively .",
    "figures 1a and 1b show the combined evolution of the gas temperature @xmath17 and grain radius @xmath75 for grains of initial radius @xmath76 and 0.1 micron , assuming @xmath77 and @xmath78 at @xmath47 and @xmath79 kpc respectively . for comparison",
    "we also plot the cooling curve @xmath17 of dust - free gas ( @xmath80 ) with the same @xmath59 and @xmath81 .",
    "dust - enhanced cooling can reduce the cooling time of recently ejected gas by over an order of magnitude compared to the dust - free case .",
    "for fixed @xmath55 , the ratio @xmath82 increases rapidly with decreasing grain radius @xmath67 because of the larger total surface area of smaller grains .",
    "a defining characteristic of cooling flows is that the isobaric radiative cooling time @xmath83 yrs ( in ngc 4472 ) exceeds the dynamical time @xmath84^{1/2}$ ] in the galactic potential .",
    "dust - free , moderately positive density perturbations do not cool appreciably faster than unperturbed regions . if overdense regions remain coherent , they oscillate radially in the hot gas atmosphere , becoming underdense relative to the ambient gas during half their cycle ( e.g. loewenstein 1989 ) .",
    "the dust - rich regions we describe here are not initially in an overdense state , but become overdense as the cooling proceeds .",
    "the dust - rich gas cools locally if the cooling time is less than the dynamical time at the two selected galactic radii , @xmath85 at @xmath47 kpc and @xmath86 yrs at 8.57 kpc .",
    "figures 1a and 1b show that @xmath87 is possible at @xmath47 kpc , so gas at small galactic radii can cool to low temperature and also preserve a small amount of its original dust since @xmath88 .",
    "the cooling curves in figures 1a and 1b are independent of @xmath52 and are therefore unchanged if the dusty envelope is disrupted or fragmented during its interaction with the hot gas .",
    "we show one case in figure 1b in which dusty gas with @xmath89 @xmath11 m begins cooling at @xmath90 , before fully thermalizing with the hot gas . the cooling time is significantly reduced , confirming our assumption that @xmath91 maximizes the cooling time .",
    "as dust - rich stellar winds flow away from orbiting red giant stars , the winds are decelerated by interactions with the local hot gas , but the grains , impelled by their higher momentum , can move into the ambient gas .",
    "it is possible in principle that the ejected dust cloud occupies and cools a gas mass larger than that ejected from the star , @xmath52 .",
    "if the cooled mass exceeds @xmath52 by a factor @xmath92 , then the corresponding cooling evolution is found simply by replacing @xmath55 in equation 4 with @xmath93 . in figure 1c",
    "we show cooling curves for @xmath94 at the same two galactic radii for grains of initial radius @xmath89 micron .",
    "both cooling times exceed the dynamical time at the galactic radii considered , so the cooling gas may have a more complex dynamical evolution that may inhibit the cooling .",
    "stellar mass loss has been regarded as an important internal source of hot gas within group or cluster - centered e galaxies .",
    "a @xmath95 gyr old stellar population of total mass @xmath96 typically expels @xmath97 @xmath1 yr@xmath8 . in cluster - centered galaxies , such as m87 in virgo and ngc 4874 in the coma cluster ,",
    "the gas temperature rapidly decreases in the central @xmath98 kpc from the virial temperature of the cluster ( 3 - 8 kev ) to the stellar virial temperature @xmath7 kev at @xmath99 kpc ( molendi 2002 ; vikhliin et al .",
    "detailed gasdynamical models of traditional cooling inflows in these cluster - centered galaxies indicate that this steep temperature gradient can only be understood if gas is being cooled by thermalization of stellar ejecta ( brighenti & mathews 2002a ) .",
    "the increase in the hot gas oxygen abundance toward the center of m87 ( gastaldello & molendi 2002 ) is expected if mass lost from the snii - enriched stars has thermally mixed into the hot ism and if the stars are more o - rich than the virgo cluster gas .",
    "nevertheless , we propose here that the dust component can cool the stellar ejecta soon after it thermally merges with the ambient hot gas , particularly at @xmath100 kpc .",
    "\\(1 ) _ what is the source of interstellar dust observed in the cores of @xmath3 percent of all large e galaxies ? _",
    "van dokkum & franx ( 1995 ) and others describe small central dust disks , lanes or clouds typically a few 100 pc in size .",
    "the small masses of dust @xmath4 @xmath1 in these cores can easily be produced in @xmath101 yrs as dust - rich gas cools near the galactic center with incomplete sputtering .",
    "it is difficult to accurately estimate the rate that dust accumulates near the center without knowledge of the dust size distribution , the exact thermal history @xmath17 of the stellar ejecta , or the star formation rate in the cold , dusty clouds . since type ia supernova remnants occupy a very small fraction of the interstellar volume at any time ( mathews 1990 ) , heating by type ia supernovae is unlikely to interfere with the cooling we describe here .",
    "heating by active galactic nuclei has often been suggested to explain why the hot gas in e galaxies fails to cool to low temperatures ( e.g. , rosner & tucker 1989 ; binney & tabor 1995 ; brighenti & mathews 2002b ) .",
    "if such heating occurs , it must be gentle enough not to destroy the observed central dust clouds or this dust must be rapidly regenerated .",
    "\\(2 ) _ what is the source of the diffuse optical line emission ( h@xmath15 + [ nii ] ) observed in most or all cooling flow galaxies ? _",
    "the velocities of this diffuse emission are unrelated to stellar velocities ( caon et al . 2000 ) . in some e galaxies",
    "the optical line emission spatially correlates with x - ray features ( e.g. trinchieri & goudfrooij 2002 ) or traces the perimeters but not the centers of x - ray cavities ( mcnamara , oconnell & sarazin 1996 ; blanton et al .",
    "2001 ) . while these observations suggest that some gas cools to @xmath102 k from the hot phase , there is no evidence for this in _ xmm _ x - ray spectra",
    "however , even if dusty gas ejected from metal - rich stars is heated to @xmath9 , it can quickly cool back to @xmath102 k where the cooling may be temporarily arrested by absorption of galactic uv starlight ( binette et al .",
    "exactly what happens next is unclear , but the dust can help cool the gas to much lower temperatures if the clouds become optically thick to uv radiation .",
    "it has often been suggested that dusty gas at @xmath5 k derives from mergers with gas - rich dwarf galaxies ( e.g. caon et al .",
    "2000 ; trinchieri & goudfrooij 2002 ) ; this can be verified if the @xmath103 k gas is counter - rotating .",
    "nevertheless , cold , dusty gas can arise naturally from stars in e galaxy cores .",
    "\\(3 ) _ why is the observed cooling rate @xmath6 from x - ray observations so low ? _ xu et al . ( 2001 ) found from rgs xmm observations of elliptical galaxy ngc 4636 that x - ray lines expected from gas cooling near @xmath104 k are unusually weak , indicating a total cooling rate of @xmath105 @xmath1 yr@xmath8 in @xmath106 kpc ( for @xmath107 mpc ) .",
    "fuse observations of ovi lines in ngc 4636 ( emitted at @xmath108 k ) indicate @xmath109 @xmath1 yr@xmath8 within 1.2 kpc ( bregman et al .",
    "both cooling rates are less than the @xmath110 @xmath1 yr@xmath8 predicted in traditional cooling flow models ( e.g. bertin & toniazzo 1995 )",
    ".    rapid dust - assisted cooling may be relevant to this discrepancy in two ways : ( 1 ) by reducing the total rate that gas enters the hot phase , and ( 2 ) by reducing the x - ray emission from cooling thermal gas at subvirial temperatures . in models of traditional cooling flows , gas ejected from stars",
    "is usually assumed to enter the hot interstellar gas .",
    "the stellar mass loss rate in a giant e galaxy , @xmath111 yr@xmath8 , is an important source of gas since it is comparable to the expected cooling rate of the hot gas . in gas dynamical models",
    "the cooling rate @xmath6 near the center of the flow varies inversely with the specific rate of stellar mass loss , @xmath112 .",
    "this is true even when there is an extended reservoir of circumgalactic hot gas due to cosmic accretion onto the surrounding galaxy group .",
    "therefore , the apparent cooling rate @xmath6 observed with xmm should be reduced approximately in proportion to the fraction of stellar gas that fails to enter the hot gas because of dust - assisted cooling .",
    "however , if more than @xmath113 percent of the stellar ejecta fails to enter the hot phase , our gasdynamical models indicate that the density of hot interstellar gas is lowered sufficiently to initiate a strong galactic wind driven by type ia energy .",
    "the transition to wind flows is rather sudden . since the very low @xmath114 characteristic of strong winds",
    "are not observed , this sets a limit on the efficiency of dust - assisted cooling described here .",
    "if dusty gas from stars is indeed heated to @xmath9 , xmm observations require that it not emit thermal x - rays at intermediate temperatures either as it is heated or as it cools afterward .",
    "we argue above that the heating phase is likely to be rapid , @xmath115 yrs .",
    "when heated to @xmath9 , the stellar gas may undergo rapid dust - assisted cooling , during which the x - ray emission from intermediate temperatures is greatly reduced .",
    "the radiation expected from an x - ray line of emissivity @xmath116 ergs s@xmath8 gm@xmath8 , @xmath117 ergs gm@xmath8 , varies inversely with the cooling rate @xmath118 , which can be @xmath119 times larger than normal plasma cooling .",
    "the x - ray line emission is suppressed by a similar factor .    in dust - assisted cooling ,",
    "much of the thermal energy in the hot gas is radiated by dust in the far - ir .",
    "the maximum fir luminosity expected , @xmath120 erg s@xmath8 , is consistent with iso fir luminosities observed in ngc 4472 and ngc 4636 , @xmath121 erg s@xmath8 ( temi et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "nevertheless , it seems unlikely that dust - enhanced cooling can explain the weakness of x - ray cooling lines from gas at subvirial temperatures in clusters ( e.g. peterson et al .",
    "2001 ) where the expected cooling rates , @xmath122 @xmath1 yr@xmath8 , greatly exceed the stellar mass loss rate in the central e or cd galaxy .",
