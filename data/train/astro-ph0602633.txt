    "the nature of accretion onto black holes at low fractions of the eddington mass accretion rate has been the topic of considerable observational and theoretical attention . especially in the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ era ,",

    "yet , the nature of accretion onto black holes even at @xmath2 remains uncertain .",
    "galactic black hole transients are especially good laboratories in which to study the manner in which flows change with mass accretion rate .",
    "in particular , clear changes in the mass accretion rate and flow geometry are thought to be marked by changes in x - ray colors , flux , fast x - ray variability , and multi - wavelength properties as a source transitions from a high  soft state to the low  hard state ( for reviews , see mcclintock & remillard 2005 , homan & belloni 2004 ) .",

    "it was noted that at least one additional parameter appears to have a profound influence on the flux and properties of an accreting black hole .",
    "homan et al .  ( 2001 ) suggested that the second parameter might be related to the size of the corona .",
    "the size of the corona might naturally be regulated by the radius of the inner edge of an optically - thick accretion disk .",
    "alternatively , the inner disk radius may not change , or may be less important than independent characteristics of the corona .    a common , paradigmatic model of how accretion",
    "flows change with state and mass accretion rate was given by esin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . in that model ,",
    "high  soft states are dominated by a standard thin accretion disk , but in the low  hard state the inner disk is radially truncated and replaced by an advection - dominated accretion flow .",
    "the same essential geometry is thought to describe quiescent phases .",
    "the fundamental assumption of a radially recessed accretion disk may find some support in the low disk reflection fractions which are sometimes measured in the low / hard state ( e.g. , gierlinski et al .",
    "beloborodov ( 1999 ) proposed a very different picture for the nature of state transitions and the accretion flow geometry in the low  hard state . in this model , black hole states are driven by the height of magnetic flares above a disk which remains at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "these flares would serve to feed a mildly relativistically  outflowing corona .",
    "low disk reflection fractions do not signal a recessed disk in this model , but result from mild beaming of the hard x - ray flux away from the disk .",

    "the full results of this multi - wavelength observing program will be presented in a separate paper , and are only mentioned briefly in this work .",
    "the `` medium '' epic optical blocking filter was used during the observations made with _",

    "the prime instrument for this observation was the epic - pn camera , which was run in timing mode .",
    "unfortunately , the source flux was too high for this mode , and the camera experienced photon pile - up .",
    "we note that _ xmm - newton _ has since revised the flux and count rate limits for timing mode to be a factor of two lower .",

    "it is well - known that fits to pca spectra of the crab with a simple power - law model reveal residuals as large as 1% , but adding 1% errors to pca data is often an over - estimate ( see , e.g. , rossi et al.2005 ) . using the tool `` grppha ''",
    ", we added 0.6% systematic errors to the pcu-2 spectra .",
    "the hexte - a cluster was operated in the standard `` archive '' mode , which has a time resolution of 32  s and covers the 10.0250.0  kev band with 61 channels .",
    "we extracted a background - subtracted spectrum from the hexte - a cluster , and an associated instrument response file , using the standard procedures .",
    "the _ xmm - newton_/epic - mos cameras nominally cover the 0.210.0  kev band .",
    "a preliminary inspection of the data revealed small but significant deviations at the lowest and highest energy bounds .",
    "these likely result from small anomalies in the instrument response function for the annuli we have used ; we therefore restricted our spectral analysis to the 0.79.0  kev band .",
    "the low energy bins in the _",
    "rxte_/pca are not calibrated as well as the central part of the bandpass , and the same is true for the higher energy portion of the bandpass .",
    "therefore , we restricted our analysis of the pcu-2 spectrum to the 2.825.0  kev band .",
    "prior experience with pca spectra suggests that the strongest xe l edge is not fully accounted for by the detector response ; in all fits to the pcu-2 spectrum detailed below , an edge at 4.78  kev with @xmath8 was included to account for this small effect .",
    "we restricted our analysis of the hexte - a spectrum to energies above 20  kev .",
    "the hexte - a spectrum has little signal above 100  kev , so this energy was set as an upper bound on all fits .",
    "xspec version 11.3.2 was used to analyze the _ xmm - newton _ and _ rxte _ spectra .",
    "all errors reported in this work are 90% confidence errors obtained by allowing all parameters to vary , unless otherwise noted .",
    "throughout the long stare obtained with _ xmm - newton _ , gx  339@xmath04 was observed with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) at 4.8 and 6.2  ghz , for the bulk of 14-hour observing runs between 16 and 19 march 2004 .",
    "the data were reduced in the standard fashion using the miriad ( e.g. , sault & killeen 2004 ) and aips ( e.g. , greisen 2005 ) software packages .",
    "the resulting images showed gx  339@xmath04 to be a point source with no obvious extension , at a resolution of @xmath9(4.8 ghz ) , and @xmath10(6.2 ghz ) .",
    "the mean flux densities ( referenced to the standard flux calibrator pks b1934@xmath0638 ) were @xmath11 ( 4.8 ghz ) and @xmath12 ( 6.2 ghz ) , where the error bars reflect the rms noise in the images from individual days , and there is no sign of strong variability .    in summary ,",
    "ratio of radio flux to x - ray flux , the radio spectral index ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) , and the lack of strong variability ( on the order of 0.1  mjy from day to day ) , are all typical of radio emission in the low  hard state .",
    "such radio emission is generally interpreted as the signature of a steady , compact jet ( e.g. , fender 2005 ) .",
    "an inspection of the _ rxte _ x - ray light curves revealed strong flaring , superimposed on a relatively stable base flux level .",
    "the flares occurred on a time scale of a few tens of seconds and the flare maxima occasionally reached count rates close to eight times that of the base level .",
    "power spectra were created from the goodxenon data ( total energy band , 260 kev ) , with frequency ranges of @xmath151024 hz .",
    "the power spectra were normalized according to belloni and hasinger ( 1990 ) and miyamoto et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , and the poisson level was subtracted following the method described in klein - wolt et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "two broad peaks could be identified in the power spectrum of each of the _ rxte _ observations ( a representative power spectrum is shown in figure 1 ) .",
    "one lorentzian peaks around 0.05 hz , corresponding to the strong flaring that is directly visible in the light curves , and a second , broader feature peaks around 2 hz .",
    "the low - frequency peak power could be fit well with one lorentzian , with a q - value ( i.e. frequency divided by full - width - at - half - maximum ) of @xmath160.3 and a fractional rms amplitude of @xmath1630% .",
    "this feature can be identified with the break that is seen in the hard state power spectra of , e.g. cyg x-1 ( belloni & hasinger 1990 ) .",
    "two lorentzians were needed to fit the feature at higher frequencies , peaking around 0.5 hz ( q fixed to 0 , rms@xmath1720% ) and 2.5 hz ( q@xmath170.15 , rms@xmath1725% ) . the total strength of the variability in the @xmath1564 hz range is about 4751% .",
    "the variability proporties in our observations are consistent with those of the canonical hard state .",
    "we made a preliminary study of the _ rxte _ pcu-2 and hexte - a spectra .",
    "the spectra were fit jointly within xspec , utilizing a constant to account for normalization differences .",
    "the continuum is well fit by a very simple model consisting of a power - law modified by absorption ( using the `` phabs '' model with @xmath18 fixed at @xmath19 , miller et al .",
    "only a broad fe  k@xmath5 emission line ( see figure 2 ) prevents the simple power - law model from being a formally acceptable fit ( @xmath20 ) . using this continuum model",
    ", we measure a photon index of @xmath21 , and a normalization of @xmath22 at 1  kev .",
    "this corresponds to an unabsorbed flux of @xmath23 in the 3100  kev band , or a luminosity of @xmath24 ( or @xmath25 ) for a distance of 8  kpc . while there is some evidence for subtle curvature in the high energy spectrum that is consistent with disk reflection",
    ", it is too weak to be significant .",
    "power - law models with an exponential high - energy cut - off and broken power - law models do not provide significant improvements to the continuum fit .    a simple power - law fit in th 20100  kev band gives an energy flux of @xmath26 , and a photon flux of @xmath27 .",
    "this places our simultaneous x - ray and radio flux measurements in the middle of the radio  x - ray flux correlation corbel et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found to hold in the low  hard state of gx  339@xmath04 , and further indicates that we observed gx  339@xmath04 in a standard low  hard state .",
    "we next explored simple continuum fits to the _ xmm - newton_/epic - mos spectra .",
    "we fit the four spectra ( mos1 and mos2 from revolutions 782 and 783 ) jointly , allowing a normalizing constant to float between the spectra . a simple power - law model like that which adequately described the _ rxte _",
    "spectra was unable to fit the continuum in the _ xmm - newton _ spectra , due to a strong soft flux excess .",
    "the presence of a strong soft excess in the _ xmm - newton _ spectra does not represent a flaw in the performance or calibration of the instruments aboard either observatory .",
    "rather , the soft flux excess is merely not required in the _ rxte _ band , due to its effective low - energy bound of 3  kev .",
    "when a low energy threshold of 3.0  kev is chosen to match that of _ rxte _ , a simple power - law model adequately describes the continuum in the _ xmm - newton _ spectra .",
    "extending this fit down to 0.7 kev reveals that the soft excess is very significant below 23  kev in the _ xmm - newton _ spectra .",
    "this effect is illustrated in figure 3 .",
    "for any reasonable continuum model ( a continuum consisting of one or two additive components , which can be strongly constrained by the data ) , fits reveal strong evidence for a relativistic iron line arising from the inner disk ( see figures 4 , 5 , and 6 ) .",
    "studies of black hole x - ray binary outbursts with _",
    "rxte _ have documented falling accretion disk flux and apparent temperature through the outburst decay ( e.g. , park et al .",
    "2004 ; see also mcclintock & remillard 2005 ) .",
    "below a certain disk temperature and flux level , however , _",
    "rxte _ is simply unable to detect disk emission . in plotting additive component fluxes measured across an outburst with _ rxte _",
    ", then , it is not uncommon to see a sudden disappearance of the disk flux .",
    "however , it is unlikely that disk emission simply turns off at this point .",
    "it is also unlikely that _ rxte _ can provide robust constraints on the nature of the disk in low - temperature , low - flux phases .",
    "it is most likely that the soft excess we have discovered with _",
    "xmm - newton _ is due to emission from an optically - thin , geometrically - thick accretion disk , and that _ xmm - newton _ is much better - suited to such measurements .",
    "we explored a number of fits with different disk components and hard components , to demonstrate that the disk and disk line components truly arise from an accretion disk , and are not modeling artifacts .",
    "we note that no fits to the _ xmm - newton_/epic - mos spectra , by themselves or in combination with _ rxte _",
    "spectra , are formally acceptable .",
    "this is due to the presence of residual instrumental response deficiencies near 1  kev and 2  kev .",
    "similar response issues have been documented previously ( e.g. , miller et al .",
    "2004b ) , and do not complicate efforts to obtain strong constraints on the nature of the accretion flow .",
    "the results of this analysis are particularly robust because the fits span the 0.7100.0  kev range , providing excellent constraints on the continuum emission , and because of the extraordinary depth of our observations .    for each model fit to the spectra ,",
    "a normalizing constant was included to allow for flux differences between _ xmm - newton _ and _ rxte_. this constant was fixed at unity for each of the mos cameras , but component normalizations ( not , e.g. , temperature or photon index ) were allowed to float between the cameras to account for more minor flux variations ( 25% or less ) . as the pca and hexte spectra are not suited to constraining the column density or the parameters of any cool disk components , all soft component parameters were tied to the values obtained for the mos-1 spectrum from revolution 782 .",
    "this procedure is reasonable as global disk parameters should only vary on the viscous timescale ( see , however , belloni et al .",
    "1997 and vadawale et al .",
    "2003 ) , which is longer than the timescale of our observations .",
    "apart from their normalizations , all emission line and hard component parameters in fits to the pca and hexte spectra were linked with parameters measured via the mos spectra .",
    "the same normalizations were used for both the pca and hexte spectra , again by tying these parameters together .",
    "the parameters measured with four plausible continuum models are listed in table 1 ( see also figures 4 , 5 , and 6 ) .",
    "the most important results obtained from these fits are that a cool @xmath28  kev disk ( cool compared to the @xmath2912  kev disks observed in high flux states ; see mcclintock & remillard 2005 ) and a strong relativistic iron line are required in each model . using the f - test",
    ", we find that both components are individually required at much more than the 8@xmath30 level of confidence . adding a smeared edge component ( `` smedge '' in xspec ; although unphysical , it is sometimes included to approximate a disk reflection continuum ) did not significantly improve the fits .",
    "this may indicate that the disk reflection is very weak ( see below ) .",
    "in the three continuum models wherein the disk radius may be inferred from the additive disk component , each fit points to an inner disk extending close to or within @xmath31 .",
    "we made fits with two different disk models to ensure that any such finding is not strongly dependent on the model chosen .",
    "inner disk radii inferred via disk continuum fits are notoriously unreliable , as they depend on the hard component assumed , the inner disk boundary condition , the column density , spectral hardening , and other effects ( see zimmerman et al.2004 for a discussion of different disk models ; see merloni , fabian , & ross 2000 for a detailed discussion of hardening effects ) . in all four models , however , the `` laor '' relativistic line model points to a disk which may extend to @xmath32 .",
    "this finding may provide additional evidence that gx  339@xmath04 harbors a spinning black hole ( miller et al .  2004a , 2004b ) .",
    "three of the models considered include additive model components ; the fourth model ( the `` bulk motion comptonization '' or bmc model ; shrader & titarchuk 1999 ) is a single continuum which attempts to account for up - scattering from a disk self - consistently .",
    "the fact that a relativistic disk line component is still strongly required in fits with the bulk motion comptonization ( bmc ) model , and that the line parameters are consistent with those measured via the additive models , signals that the line itself is not an artifact of using additive components to fit the x - ray continuum .",
    "moreover , the measured values of the line are similar in each model .",
    "we note that the disk temperature derived via the bmc model ( @xmath33  kev ) is at most 0.1  kev lower than values obtained via the fits with additive components , and that the best fit is obtained with the canonical `` diskbb '' plus `` power - law '' continuum .",
    "this finding may indicate that the disk emission is not strongly comptonized , and that any coronal geometry may not strongly distort our view of the inner disk .",
    "simple theoretical considerations strongly support interpreting the cool soft excess we have observed as an accretion disk . for standard thin accrection disks , @xmath34 ( assuming that @xmath35 ;",
    "e.g. , frank , king , & raine 2002 ) . based on an _ xmm - newton _ observation of gx  339@xmath04 in the `` very high '' or `` steep power - law state '' ,",
    "miller et al .",
    "( 2004b ) report an apparent disk temperature of @xmath36  kev for an unabsorbed disk flux of @xmath37 ( 0.510.0  kev ) .",
    "in the low ",
    "hard state observation described in this work , the unabsorbed disk flux is 10% of the total , or @xmath38 , and the range of disk temperatures is @xmath39 0.270.38  kev .",
    "the ratio of apparent temperatures and mass accretion rates is fully consistent with the @xmath40 relation expected for standard thin accretion disks which extend to the innermost stable circular orbit .    while the results of these fits with simple models clearly demonstrate the presence and robustness of a broad fe  k emission line , it is also worth noting that this line profile clearly reveals the importance of dynamical broadening . the line profile ( see fig .  5 and fig .",
    "6 ) is similar to the classic , two - horn profile originally found in the spectrum of mcg6 - 30 - 15 with _ asca _ ( tanaka et al .",
    "1995 ) . in one sense",
    ", this shape more clearly reveals that the line is broadened by dynamical processes , than extremely skewed lines : at least in the case of seyfert agn , the extreme red wing in some lines may be partially affected by ( though not due to ) low - energy absorption ( e.g. , vaughan & fabian 2004 ) .",
    "similarly , this line shape , and the absence of fe xxv and fe xxvi absorption lines in the spectrum , serve to rule - out high energy absorption as a contribution to the line shape and flux ( e.g. , done & gierlinski 2006 ) .",
    "prior work has discussed alternative broadening mechanisms extensively .",
    "it has been shown that comptonization is extremely unlikely to cause the broadening observed ( e.g. , fabian et al .",
    "1995 , reynolds & wilms 2000 ) .",
    "velocity shifts and/or scattering effects in a jet or outflow ( e.g. , titarchuk , kazanas , & becker 2003 ) have also been shown to be extremely unlikely sources of line broadening ( fabian et al .",
    "1995 ; miller et al .",
    "2004a ) .",
    "the fits we have made with relativistic line models imply a low inner disk inclination in gx  339@xmath04 .",
    "an inclination of @xmath41 is consistent with the fits obtained , and prior fits to the line profile ( miller et al .",
    "2004a , b ) . if the binary is viewed at this low inclination , an implausibly high black hole mass would be implied ( hynes et al .",
    "however , the inner disk and binary plane can be misaligned in black hole binaries . in at least two systems ( gro  j1655@xmath040 and v4641  sgr ) , the inner disk inclination implied by relativistic jets and the orbital plane of the binary are known to be significantly different ( see , e.g. , maccarone 2002 ) .",
    "it is likely that gx  339@xmath04 is another such system .",
    "a velocity of 0.9@xmath42 is sufficient to create the doppler boosting needed to make the approaching jet visible and the receding jet invisible within an angle of @xmath43 , in radio observations of jets launched from gx  339@xmath04 ( gallo et al .",
    "this implies that the inner disk is viewed at an inclination of @xmath43 or less , since the jet velocity may be higher and the beaming angle tighter ( gallo et al .",
    "the inclination implied by our spectral fits is broadly consistent with that inferred from jets .",
    "if the inclination is instead fixed at a value as high as @xmath44 , the inner radius implied by fits with laor line components is still within @xmath45 , although this inclination forces a significantly worse fit statistically .",
    "as the results of spectral fits with simple models clearly reveal an accretion disk and relativistic disk line , we next attempted fits with disk reflection models .",
    "the methodology outlined above was employed , with regard to multiplicative constants and normalizations .",
    "reflection models predict that an fe  k emission line is merely the most prominent part of the interaction between hard x - rays and the accretion disk ; more subtle effects include a small flux decrement above the line energy , and a `` reflection hump '' which normally peaks between 2030  kev .",
    "fitting disk reflection models , then , represents the most self - consistent means of treating the relativistic line and hard x - ray continuum .    we considered two disk reflection models : the `` constant density ionized disk '' model with solar abundances ( cdid ; ballantyne , iwasawa , & fabian 2001 ) , and `` pexriv '' ( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) .",
    "it is expected that the cdid model is more physical , in that it is suited to high disk ionization and includes the effects of comptonization on absorption edges .",
    "we therefore used the results of fits with the cdid model as a guide when fitting `` pexriv '' , which has more free parameters .",
    "in particular , we fixed the disk temperature and ionization parameter within `` pexriv '' to values consistent with those obtained when fitting the cdid model . it should also be noted that whereas the cdid model explicitly includes fe line emission , pexriv does not , and an additional laor line component was included in fits with pexriv .",
    "finally , reflection models are calculated in the fluid frame , and to match the observed spectrum , a reflection model must be convolved with the relativistic effects expected in the inner disk around a black hole .",
    "these effects expected around a spinning black hole are described by the `` laor '' line model , and so we convolved the cdid and pexriv models with the laor line element in all spectral fits .",
    "this procedure is referred to as relativistic blurring . in the case of fits with pexriv",
    ", the blurring parameters were simply tied to the independent line component parameters .",
    "fitting blurred reflection models is computationally intensive ; the fits themselves and error scans can take several days to calculate even on high  end workstations .",
    "we therefore took the pragmatic step of only including the _ xmm - newton_/epic - mos spectra from revolution 782 .",
    "the spectra from revolution 782 have more counts than those from 783 , as there was more observing time free from instrumental flaring .",
    "it is useful to compare our current results to those obtained from reflection fits to bright hard states .",

    "1997 ) .",
    "whereas low disk reflection fractions could previously be explained in terms of a radially - recessed accretion disk , our data appear to rule out such an explanation .",
    "the apparently inconsistent findings of a disk remaining at the innermost stable circular orbit , and a low reflection fraction , can be reconciled if the hard x - ray emission is mildly beamed away from the accretion disk . as with the case of phenomenological models discussed above and detailed in table 1",
    ", we found that the parameter values obtained with reflection models are not strongly dependent on the assumed inner disk inclination .    from the soruce luminosity and the ionization parameter measured via the cdid model , it is possible to estimate the density of the reflecting medium .",
    "assuming an inner radius of @xmath52 , a density of @xmath53 is implied . further assuming a radiative efficiency of 0.1 , continuity in the accretion flow means that the product of the radial inflow velocity @xmath54 and the relative thickness of the disk @xmath55 is about @xmath56 .",
    "such a small value for this product means that we are dealing with a dense thin disk ( @xmath55 small ) where the radial inflow velocity is much smaller than the tangential , keplerian one , @xmath57 . for an @xmath5-disk , @xmath58 , so @xmath59 .",
    "this is well satisfied if @xmath60 and @xmath61 as expected for a standard thin disk .",
    "of course , disk reflection only deals with the density near the surface of the disk ; a higher mean disk density only strengthens the result .",
    "thus , our reflection fits also strongly suggest that there is something approximating a standard thin disk at small radii .",
    "we note that our results do not place strong constraints on the dominant hard x - ray emission mechanism(s ) .",
    "it is possible that thermal comptonization , synchrotron emission , and synchrotron self - comptonization all play important roles in defining the hard x - ray emission in the low  hard state .",
    "the apparent lack of a clear break or cut - off in the high energy spectrum may argue that thermal comptonization is not the dominant emission mechanism , or may simply argue for a coronal electron temperature in excess of 100  kev .      in view of the remarkable results detailed above",

    "observation 40027010 was obtained on 11 november 1993 starting at 01:37:04 ; the gis-3 spectrum considered here has a net exposure time of 38  ksec .    assuming a standard value for the column density along the line of sight to cygnus x-1 ( @xmath62 ; miller et al .",
    "2002b ) , a power - law fit to the spectrum above 3.0  kev yields a @xmath63 photon power - law index typical of the low  hard state in cygnus x-1 .",
    "extending this power - law down to 1.0  kev reveals a strong cool accretion disk component like that found in gx  339@xmath04 ( see figure 9 ) .",
    "moreover , a broad , relativistic fe  k@xmath5 emission line is revealed , which is again suggestive of a disk which extends to @xmath31 or less ( see figure 10 ) .    before including a disk component ,",
    "the best fit statistic that can be achieved with this power - law index is @xmath64 . allowing the column density to float within 30% of the standard value , which is a common deviation between instruments ,",

    "our results suggest that a standard cool accretion disk may extend to the innermost stable circular orbit in the low  hard state . in a brief analysis of archival _ asca _ spectrum , we find that similar results are readily obtained for cygnus x-1 . moreover , a spectrum recently obtained from the black hole candidate swift j1753.5@xmath00127 ( miller , homan , & miniutti 2006 ) during the decline of its outburst appears to support this disk geometry .",
    "although we observed gx  339@xmath04 in a rising phase , swift j1753.5@xmath00127 was observed during outburst decline , and cygnus x-1 is a persistent source , suggesting that disks may commonly remain at or close to the isco in bright phases of the low  hard state .",
    "these results have a number of consequences .",
    "transitions between low  hard and high  soft states in black hole binaries may not necessarily signal a change in inner disk radius .",
    "moreover , in apparent contrast to the absence of jets in disk - dominated high  soft states ( see , e.g. , fender , belloni , & gallo 2004 ) , it may be possible to maintain a compact , steady jet while the disk remains at the innermost stable circular orbit .",
    "homan et al .  (",
    "2001 ) noted that state transitions may be partly related to changes in the corona ; our results strengthens this suggestion .    the idea that a transition into the low ",
    "hard state marks the onset of an adaf with a truncated inner disk ( e.g. , esin , mcclintock , & narayan 1997 ) has become a near - paradigm in studies of accreting black holes .",
    "our results suggest that an optically - thick accretion disk with properties closely related to disks observed at higher inferred accretion rates can operate in the low  hard state . however , simple theoretical considerations suggest that it is very unlikely that a standard thin disk is part of the inner accretion flow in quiescence .",
    "observational evidence also appears to rule - out the possibility of a standard accretion disk at the isco in quiescence ( see , e.g. , mcclintock , horne , & remillard 1995 ) . by extension , then , our findings suggest that the accretion flow geometry in quiescence may not be a simple extrapolation of the geometry of the flow in the low  hard state",
    ".    fits to the spectra with reflection models reveal a covering fraction significantly less than unity ( see table 2 ) , consistent with prior disk reflection fits in the low  hard state ( e.g. gierlinski et al.1997 ) .",
    "while a recessed disk would serve to give less disk reflection , this possibility is inconsistent with our results .",
    "a hard component which is mildly beamed away from the disk provides a plausible way to reconcile these findings .",
    "beloborodov ( 1999 ) described a model wherein the corona is fed by magnetic flares from the disk , and the height of such flares determines the nature of the corona . in the low ",
    "hard state , the flares reach mildly relativistic velocities ( @xmath77 ) , sufficient to mildly beam the hard x - ray emission away from the disk . a broadly similar scenario has been described by merloni & fabian ( 2002 ) ; in that work , the ability of a magnetically  dominated corona to launch jets is considered",
    ". these models may give insight into how disks might be connected to jets through a corona , and/or give a sense of how a corona might act as the base of a jet .",
    "separately , the possible role of a jet in producing hard x - ray emission in the low  hard state has been discussed in detail .",
    "markoff , falcke , & fender ( 2001 ) suggested that all of the hard x - ray emission in xte  j1118@xmath76480 may be due to the steady , compact jet implied by radio observations .",
    "subsequent studies have focused more on the role of synchrotron self - comptonization ; in this sense , they partially bridge the gap between synchrotron  dominated jet models and traditional thermal comptonization models of the corona .",
    "markoff & nowak ( 2004 ) have showed that the level of disk reflection predicted by jet - dominated emission models is consistent with observations .    while our deep observation of gx  339@xmath04 may provide the most convincing evidence that a standard thin disk is important in the low ",
    "hard state , it is not the first such evidence .",
    "prior reports of cool disks in the low  hard state have sometimes been overlooked and/or regarded skeptically . a cool soft excess in the low ",
    "hard state spectrum of cygnus x-1 was previously reported by ebisawa et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , in the same _ asca _ spectrum we considered above .",
    "the presence of a cool thermal component in the low  hard state of cygnus x-1 can be traced back much farther : barr & van der woerd ( 1990 ) and balucinska & hasinger ( 1991 ) both reported that a soft excess was required to describe the low ",
    "hard state spectrum of cygnus x-1 .",
    "the interpretation of this component as a disk was complicated by the possibility that the black hole may partially accrete from the wind of its massive companion .",
    "however , such a wind is clearly not present in gx  339@xmath04 , and the evidence for a disk in the low  hard state of gx  339@xmath04 supports the disk interpetation of the soft component in cygnus x-1 .",
    "if a disk interpretation of this component was doubted because the black hole may partially accrete via the wind from its massive companion , the clear evidence for a disk in the low - mass binary gx  339@xmath04 should make its interpretation clear .",
    "it is likely that current views of the low ",
    "hard state have been heavily influenced by recent observations with _",
    "rxte_. while the flexibility of _ rxte _ has made it possible to study the bright phases of accreting sources with densely - spaced observations , our results demonstrate that its effective lower energy threshold of 3  kev makes it insensitive to cool thermal components .",
    "for instance , zdziarski et al .  (",
    "2004 ) address the accretion flow as a function of state in gx  339@xmath04 using _ rxte _ data ; figure 10 in that work indicates that the disk suddenly and sharply changes its inner radius across state transitions .",
    "such marked changes in apparent inner disk radius are more likely driven by instrumental limitations , and/or by modeling assumptions , than physical properties .",
    "if a mechanism such as conduction can radially truncate a disk by driving rapid evaporation ( e.g. , meyer - hofmeister & meyer 1999 ) , it is clear that it does not necessarily activate with the transition to the low  hard state . in the absence of such a mechanism , a standard thin disk which is truncated interior to 50100",
    "@xmath78 is not necessarily a stable configuration .",
    "assuming an accretion efficiency of 10% and taking only the mass accretion rate implied by the disk flux in our observations of gx  339@xmath04 , the radial inward drift caused by viscosity in a standard disk , should transfer material to the innermost stable circular orbit from 50100  @xmath78 in approximately @xmath79",
    "s. while much longer than the free - fall time and the orbital timescale at 50100  @xmath78 , this drift timescale is still quite short , and serves to demonstrate how easily a disk can begin to fill an evacuated inner volume .    in future work on the low  hard state , it will be important to try to reconcile apparent uv disk components like that found in xte  j1118@xmath76480 ( e.g. , mcclintock et al .  2001 ) with cool x - ray disk components . if the two can not be reconciled , it is possible that soft x - ray excesses which appear to be cool disks may arise via other means .",
    "it is also possible that apparent uv disk components are not pure disk components , and possible that such components are not well understood . in a survey of uv spectra from short - period black hole binaries , hynes ( 2005 )",
    "finds that the spectra are generally steeper than the canonical @xmath80 disk spectrum , and that the broad - band optical spectra are consistent with power - law forms .",
    "studies of the ir , optical , and uv variability observed from xte  j1118@xmath76480 in its low  hard state indicate a synchrotron origin for the variability ( hynes et al.2003 ) , suggesting that uv emission in the low ",
    "hard state is not solely due to a disk .",
    "it is sometimes argued that the low - frequency qpos ( on the order of 1  hz , and lower ) occasionally observed in the low  hard state , serve to indicate that the disk is radially recessed .",
    "such arguments are largely based on the assumption that the low qpo frequency reflects the keplerian orbital frequency of the inner disk .",
    "this inference would certainly contradict spectroscopic evidence that the inner disk extends to the isco , at least in the bright phases of the low  hard state . since the nature of low frequency qpos is an open question , it is not possible to entirely refute the possibility that these qpos signal a recessed disk .",
    "a few simple considerations , however , argue against interpreting low - frequency qpos as evidence for a recessed disk .",
    "first , the qpos observed are _ x - ray _ qpos , and energetic arguments demand that accreting material release most of its energy in the inner few schwarzchild radii .",
    "a disk truncated at several tens or hundreds of schwarzschild radii , but which still contributes substantial x - ray emission , is problematic from the standpoint of producing strong x - ray oscillations in the _ rxte _ bandpass . embedding",
    "the disk in a comptonizing corona might solve this problem , and may even explain the fact that the strength of qpos is often observed to increase with energy .",
    "however , in adaf plus truncated disk models , most comptonization occurs interior to the truncated disk , and embedding a disk in that volume is inconsistent with the basic premise of the model .",
    "second , although high frequency qpos are apparently absent in the low  hard state , it is not necessarily appropriate to associate the keplerian frequency at the inner disk with low - frequency qpos .",
    "low - frequency qpos similar to those found in low  hard states are often observed _ simultaneously _ with high - frequency qpos in the `` very high '' and `` intermediate '' states ( also known as `` steep power - law '' states , or , more generically , bright hard states ; see mcclintock & remillard 2005 ) . in such cases ,",
    "low - frequency qpos are _ not _ used to infer the inner disk radius ; it is inconsistent to interpret low - frequency qpos in this way in the low  hard state .",
    "we note that it is possible that high frequency qpos are actually present in the low / hard state , but have simply not been detected due to a lack of sensitivity .",
    "we know of no work which has demonstrated that high frequency qpos are absent in the low / hard state , at an rms upper limit similar to the rms at which high - frequency qpos are detected in other states . far tighter limits will be required to also rule - out the possibility that the high frequency qpo formation mechanism depends more strongly on the mass accretion rate than the inner disk radius .",
    "these considerations do not argue against the possibility that qpo frequency trends ( see , e.g. , rossi et al .",
    "2004 , belloni et al .",
    "2005 ) signal a real geometrical change in black hole systems .",
    "it is possible that changes in the size of the corona , the distance between the inner disk and jet , the scale height of flares above the disk , or the timescale for superorbital variations in the disk itself may be reflected in such frequency trends .",
    "a large number of simultaneous multi - wavelength observations of black holes in the near future may help to reveal the nature of low frequency qpos .",
    "fender , belloni , & gallo ( 2004 ) have recently proposed a broad model for jet production in black hole binary systems .",
    "this model succeeds in accounting for many of the observed radio and x - ray properties in these systems . among the most important things",
    "any such model needs to address , is the ubiquitous production of jets in low ",
    "hard states , and the absence of jets in high  soft states , when the disk is strongest .",
    "indeed , the absence of jets in the most disk  dominated states demonstrates that disk",
    " jet coupling may be complex .    within the current framework of the fender , belloni , & gallo ( 2004 ) model , the absence of jet production in the high  soft state is associated with a smaller inner disk radius in this state .",
    "our results indicate that the inner disk radius may not change across state transitions , and suggest that another parameter is likely responsible for quenching jets in the high  soft state .",
    "for instance , if the corona is central to driving jets , the ratio of energy dissipated in the corona to that dissipated in the disk may be critical .",
    "a corona which is efficiently cooled below a certain electron temperature by the disk may be less able to drive jets than a very hot corona .",
    "detailed spectroscopy across a black hole outburst could test whether or not the empirical `` jet line '' found in hardness ",
    "intensity diagrams can be explained in terms of this ratio .",
    "this parameter , and others , may naturally fit within the larger framework of the fender , belloni , & gallo ( 2004 ) model .",
    "it is also possible that there may be _ no _ simple disk ",
    "jet connection in accreting black holes .",
    "it has already been noted that if the jet has any role to play in x - ray emission , correlations between radio and x - ray luminosity may not be disk  jet connections , but jet  jet connections ( markoff et al .",
    "if the jet does not play a significant role in x - ray emission , such relations may portray corona  jet connections ( though if the corona is indeed the base of a jet , whether such relations represent jet  jet connections or corona  jet connections is largely a question of semantics ) .",
    "our results also suggest that there is no clear relation between hard x - ray emission and inner disk radius , regardless of the hard x - ray emission mechanism , so any corona ",
    "jet connections could be quite independent of the inner radius of the disk .",
    "it is sometimes suggested that stellar - mass black holes in the low  hard state , and low - luminosity agn ( llagn ) and liners may have a common inner accretion flow geometry ( e.g. , markowitz & uttley 2005 ) .",
    "although many llagn are likely observed at lower eddington fractions ( @xmath81@xmath82 ) than the range covered by the three stellar - mass black hole observations considered in this work , if llagn are truly supermassive black holes in the low  hard state , our results suggest that the accretion disks in these sources may also remain at the isco .",
    "this suggestion adds to recent evidence that disks are not dramatically recessed in llagn and liners .",
    "maser emission from the accretion disk in ngc 4258 demands that any inner advective region can be no larger than 100  @xmath83 ( herrnstein et al .",
    "moreover , a recent uv variability study has detected emission which can be associated with a disk in a number of liners ( maoz et al.2005 ) .",
    "extremely deep x - ray observations of nearby llagn such as m81 * and ngc 4258 may be required to determine whether the disks in these sources are recessed , or if they remain at the isco .",
    "a long _ xmm - newton _ observation of gx  339@xmath04 has demonstrated that a standard thin accretion disk can remain at the innermost stable circular orbit around a black hole in the low  hard state .",
    "this finding has a few important consequences .",
    "advection - dominated accretion flows with truncated thin disks may be important at very low fractions of the eddington limit , but do not appear to describe the low  hard state at @xmath84 .",
    "similarly , our results suggest the production of steady compact jets in the low  hard state , and the quenching of jets in the high  soft state , are phenomena unrelated to the inner radius of the accretion disk .",
