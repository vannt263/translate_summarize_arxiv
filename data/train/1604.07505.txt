    "progresses in both the theoretical and observational aspects in past decades have lead to the developments of the standard cosmological model , i.e. , the cold dark matter plus a cosmological constant ( @xmath2cdm ) model .",
    "one of the foundations of @xmath2cdm model is the so - called cosmological principle , which says that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scale .",
    "the @xmath2cdm model is to some degree in accordance with cosmological observations , such as the statistics of galaxies @xcite , the halo power spectrum @xcite .",
    "particularly , the approximate isotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation from the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( _ wmap _ ) @xcite and _ planck _ @xcite satellites is a strong support to the cosmological principle .",
    "the @xmath2cdm model has succeeded in accounting for some properties of the universe , e.g. , the large - scale structure in the distribution of galaxies , the abundances of hydrogen and helium , the accelerating expansion of the universe , and so on .",
    "although @xmath2cdm model has achieved great successes , it also confronts many challenges .",
    "the main difficulty that @xmath2cdm model encounters is the explanation for some anisotropic phenomena .",
    "these include the alignments of low multipoles in the cmb angular power spectrum @xcite , the spatial variation of the fine - structure constant @xcite , the large - scale alignments of quasar polarization vectors @xcite , the unexpected large - scale bulk flow @xcite .",
    "especially , the hemispherical asymmetry of cmb @xcite puts a serious challenge on @xmath2cdm model .",
    "these imply that the universe may deviate from isotropy and the validity of cosmological principle is questionable . in the theoretical aspect ,",
    "some anisotropic cosmological models have been proposed , such as the bianchi type i cosmological model @xcite , the extended topological quintessence model @xcite , the @xmath2cdm model with a scalar perturbation @xcite , the finsler - randers cosmological model @xcite .    at the end of the twentieth century ,",
    "two collaborations independently found by measuring the luminosity distance of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) that the universe is accelerated expanding @xcite . since then , sne ia are widely used as the distance indicators to trace the expansion of the universe .",
    "this is because sne ia are often assumed to be produced by the gravitational collapse of white dwarfs whose mass exceeds the chandrasekhar limit , hence all sne ia have approximately the same absolute magnitude . until now , sne ia are still among the most ideal standard candles to probe the large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "recently , some methods have been developed to single out the anisotropic signals hiding in the sne ia data .",
    "assuming the observed distance modulus deviating from the theoretical prediction of @xmath2cdm model is the dipole form , it was shown that the dipole component is necessary at more than @xmath3 confidence level @xcite . by dividing the sky into two opposite hemispheres and comparing the cosmological parameters ( such as @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) in each hemisphere , some preferred directions have been identified @xcite .",
    "a similar method , except that the hemisphere is replaced by a spherical cap of fixed stretch angle , has been developed @xcite .",
    "another way is to divide the sky into @xmath7 patches of the same area , and compare the cosmological parameters in each patch @xcite .",
    "a method called smoothed residual has been used to search for the preferred direction @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , all the sne ia data sets only cover a limited region of the full sky . in other words ,",
    "the angular distribution of data points in the sky is far from homogeneous . on the other hand ,",
    "the systematic uncertainties are still large .",
    "it is doubtable whether the anisotropic signals are arising from the intrinsic property of the universe , or just due to the statistical noise .",
    "@xcite showed that the celestial incompleteness of current sne ia samples may lead to the anisotropic signals .",
    "it was noted that the preferred directions derived from the union2 @xcite data set using two different methods , i.e. , dipole - fitting ( df ) method and hemisphere comparison ( hc ) method , are approximately opposite @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the discrepancy may be due to the inhomogeneous angular distribution of the data points .",
    "moreover , @xcite found the dipole direction of the jla @xcite data set is approximately opposite to that of the union2 data set .",
    "in general , the anisotropic signals singled out from sne ia depend on both the methods and data sets that are used in the analysis . therefore , it is still premature to make a conclusive conclusion at present .",
    "this paper is the continuation of our previous work @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to test the statistical significance of anisotropic signals hiding in the supernovae data sets .",
    "we first use two different methods , i.e. , df and hc , to search for the preferred direction in the union2.1 @xcite .",
    "we will show that the preferred directions obtained using these two methods are very different .",
    "then we use monte carlo ( mc ) simulations to show that df method is statistically significant .",
    "however , hc method could nt correctly reproduce the fiducial direction when the data points are really anisotropic .",
    "moreover , hc method may pick out pseudo anisotropic signals when the data points are actually isotropic . to alleviate the discrepancy between these two methods , we model the matter density to be the dipole form .",
    "we fit our model to union2.1 , and obtained the preferred direction which is consistent with the result of df method .",
    "the rest of the paper is arranged as follows : in section [ sec : dipole ] , we briefly introduce the df method , then use it to search for the dipole direction of union2.1 .",
    "mc simulations are applied to test the statistical significance . in section",
    "[ sec : hemisphere ] , we exploit the hc method to search for the preferred direction hiding in union2.1 , and test the statistical significance using mc simulations . in section",
    "[ sec : matterdensity ] , we parameterize the matter density of the universe to be the dipole form , and search for the direction of maximum matter density . finally , discussions and and conclusions are given in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "in this section , we first briefly introduce the df method and the union2.1 data set that are used in our analysis .",
    "then we use df method to search for the possible anisotropy of union2.1 . finally , we apply mc simulations to test the statistical significance of our results . in",
    "what follows , we assume that the isotropic background space time is described by the spatially flat @xmath2cdm model . in this model , the distance - redshift relation is given by @xmath8 where @xmath5 is the hubble constant today , and @xmath4 is the normalized matter density .",
    "the distance modulus is related to the luminosity distance by @xmath9 throughout this paper , a quantity with a bar over it means that it is calculated from @xmath2cdm model .",
    "the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath4 are derived from fitting to the union2.1 data set .",
    "the union2.1 is a compilation of 580 well calibrated sne ia in the redshift range @xmath10 $ ] @xcite .",
    "each supernova has well measured redshift @xmath11 , distance modulus @xmath12 and its uncertainty @xmath13 , and the position in the equatorial coordinates . to directly compare with previous works , we transform the equatorial coordinates into galactic coordinates .",

    "the result is @xmath17 here and follows , all the uncertainties are given at @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) confidence level .",
    "next , we assume the  real \" distance modulus is not isotropic , but is the dipole form , i.e. , @xmath20,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the dipole amplitude , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the unit vectors pointing towards the dipole direction and supernova position , respectively . in the galactic coordinates ,",
    "the dipole direction can be parameterized as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 $ ] are the galactic longitude and latitude , respectively , and @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 are three orthogonal unit vectors .",
    "similarly , the position of the @xmath30th supernova can be written as @xmath31 .",
    "now the theoretical distance modulus in equation ( [ eq : chi2 ] ) is given by equation ( [ eq : mu_dipole ] ) .",
    "minimizing the right - hand - side of equation ( [ eq : chi2 ] ) leads to the dipole amplitude @xmath32 and the dipole direction @xmath33 this result is obtained from fixing @xmath4 and @xmath5 to the values given in equation ( [ eq : parameter_iso ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : dipole_amplitude ] ) implies that the union2.1 data set deviates from isotropy at more than @xmath3 confidence level . the dipole direction in equation ( [ dipole_direction ] )",
    "is consistent with that obtained by @xcite using the same data set .",
    "both the dipole amplitude and dipole direction are well consistent with that derived from union2 @xcite .",
    "the distribution of supernovae in the sky is extremely inhomogeneous . due to the narrow sky coverage of detectors , especially the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) supernovae survey , more than one half data points cluster near the celestial equator , with declination smaller than @xmath34 . besides , the measured distance moduli extracted from light curves have an average uncertainty at the order of @xmath35 mag . to check",
    "if the inhomogeneous distribution of data points have some influences on our results , and also to check if the anisotropic signals are indeed arising from the intrinsic property of the universe or just due to the statistical noise , we create four union2.1-like mock samples to test the statistical significance our results .    * sample a : the positions are unchanged , and the distance moduli have a fiducial dipole direction .",
    "this can be done by replacing the distance modulus of the @xmath30th supernova with a random number generated from the gaussian distribution @xmath36 , where @xmath37 $ ] , @xmath21 and @xmath38 are respectively the dipole amplitude and dipole direction of union2.1 , which are given in equations ( [ eq : dipole_amplitude ] ) and ( [ dipole_direction ] ) .",

    "finally , we use four mock samples constructed in the last section to test the statistical significance of our results .",
    "the main idea of hc method is to divide the sky into two opposite hemispheres , and fit the data points in each hemisphere to a specific cosmological model ( e.g. , @xmath2cdm model ) separately . then compare the cosmological parameters ( such as @xmath4 ) between different hemispheres and find the hemispheres with most discrepancy .",
    "the detailed procedures are as follows :    1 .   given any direction @xmath22 , the corresponding ` equator ' cuts the sky into two hemispheres without intersection , which we call ` up ' hemisphere and ` down ' hemisphere , respectively .",
    "hence , the data points are divided into two subgroups according to their positions in the sky .",

    "let @xmath22 runs over the whole sky , and find the direction which can maximize the value @xmath70 .",
    "here we give some notes . in the first step ,",
    "when we use the name ` equator ' , we mean the great circle perpendicular to the direction @xmath22 . in the second step ,",
    "when fitting the data to @xmath2cdm model , the hubble parameter @xmath5 is marginalized using the method presented in @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to free @xmath5 , and fit @xmath4 and @xmath5 simultaneously .",
    "fixing @xmath5 does not significantly affect the results @xcite . in the third step , due to the continuity of the sky",
    ", it is in practice impossible to let @xmath22 runs over the whole sky .",
    "one usual way is to divide the sky into @xmath71 pixels with equal area using the healpix method @xcite , and let @xmath22 runs over the center of each pixel .",
    "we choose @xmath72 so that the sky is divided into @xmath73 pixels .",
    "this division has an angular resolution about @xmath74 . dividing the sky into more pixels can , but can not significantly , improve the accuracy @xcite .",
    "we are in the way to investigate the anisotropy of union2.1 .",
    "we find the direction of maximum anisotropy points towards @xmath75 or equivalently , its antipode @xmath76 in this two directions , the anisotropic amplitude , as defined in equation ( [ eq : domegam ] ) , is @xmath77 . in what follows , when we say the direction of maximum anisotropy",

    "however , as is mentioned in the last section , the dipole direction of union2.1 derived using df method is well consistent with that of union2 .",
    "the union2.1 data set is the updated version of union2 by adding 23 more supernovae and by reducing the systematic uncertainty .",
    "the coincidence between both the dipole amplitudes and dipole directions of union2.1 and union2 strongly implies that the anisotropic signals hiding in these two data sets do not significantly differ from each other .",
    "therefore , we suspect that the discrepancy between the directions of maximum anisotropy of union2.1 and union2 is due to the low statistical significance of hc method . to prove our hypothesis , we apply hc method to four mock samples .",
    "first , we apply hc method to mock sample a. note that hc method is much more computationally expansive than df method . due to the limited computational time",
    ", we just do 100 mc simulations .",

    "[ fig : hc1 ] .",

    "we also plot the fiducial dipole direction ( black diamond ) and its antipode ( black triangle ) for comparison .",
    "we can see that the directions of maximum anisotropy of mock samples are randomly distributed in the sky .",
    "this is beyond our expectation , because all the mock samples have the same fiducial dipole direction .",
    "this implies that hc method , although can approximately reproduce the anisotropic amplitude , in some cases may fail to reproduce the preferred direction .",
    "the angular distribution of mock sample a is extremely inhomogeneous . to test",
    "if the homogeneous distribution of data points can improve this situation , we apply hc method to mock sample b. the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : hc2 ] .",

    "the probability that the mock amplitude is larger than @xmath82 is about @xmath87 , which is a little smaller than that of mock sample a. similar to mock sample a , the directions of maximum anisotropy of mock sample b are also randomly distributed in the sky , see panel ( b ) .",
    "therefore , we may come to the conclusion that the homogeneous distribution of data points could nt significantly improve the reliability of hc method .",

    "the probability that @xmath70 is larger than @xmath82 is about @xmath90 , which is comparable to that of mock sample a and sample b. since mock sample c is fiducially isotropic , the detected anisotropic signals must be caused by the statistical noise .",

    "there is only @xmath114 probability that @xmath108 is larger than @xmath60 .",
    "this implies that the statistical significance of our method , although is relatively lower than df method , is much higher than hc method .    to test",
    "if the homogeneous distribution of data points can improve our results , we search for the @xmath4-dipole in mock sample b. the amplitudes and directions of @xmath4-dipole in 1000 mc simulations are plotted in panel ( a ) and panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : om2 ] , respectively .",
    "the amplitudes follow the gaussian distribution , with an average values @xmath115 , and standard deviation @xmath116 .",
    "these are comparable to that of mock sample a. however , the mock directions are much more clustered than in the sample a case .",

    "there is a negligible probability ( @xmath120 ) that @xmath53 .",
    "this means that the statistical significance can be highly improved if the data points are homogeneously distributed .",
    "next , the same procedure is applied to mock sample c. the results of 1000 mc simulations are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : om3 ] .",

    "hence , similar to hc method , @xmath4-dipole fitting may also lead to pseudo anisotropic signals when the data are actually isotropic .",
    "however , the @xmath4-dipole of union2.1 shows large uncertainty , with @xmath18 upper limit 0.275 . taking this into consideration , the probability that the mock amplitude is larger than 0.275 is only @xmath124 . as is expected ,",
    "the mock directions are almost homogeneously distributed in the sky , see panel ( b ) of fig .",

    "similar to mock sample c case , the amplitudes of mock sample d also follow the gaussian distribution .",
    "the average value @xmath125 and standard deviation @xmath126 are a little smaller than that of mock sample c. the probabilities that @xmath127 and @xmath128 are @xmath129 and @xmath130 , respectively .",
    "they are much smaller compared to mock sample c case .",
    "this further implies that the homogeneous distribution of data points can highly improve the statistical significance .",
    "panel ( b ) is the distribution of mock directions in the sky .",
    "they seem to be more homogeneous than in the mock sample c case .    in conclusion",
    ", we obtained the amplitude and direction of @xmath4-dipole in union2.1 dat set .",
    "the direction of maximum @xmath4 is aligned with the @xmath12-dipole direction , but it is more than @xmath18 away from the direction of maximum @xmath4 resulting from hc method .",
    "mc simulation show that our method is much more statistically significant than hc method , although it is not as significant as df method .",
    "if the data points are homogeneously distributed in the sky , the statistical significance can be further improved .",
    "in this paper , we applied two different methods , i.e. , df and hc methods , to probe the anisotropic signals hiding in union2.1 data set .",
    "we found that the directions of maximum @xmath4 derived using df and hc methods are @xmath131 and @xmath132 , respectively .",
    "these two directions are about @xmath0 away from each other .",
    "four union2.1-like mock samples were constructed to test the statistical significant of both methods , and we arrived at the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "df method can correctly reproduce both the anisotropic amplitude and the anisotropic direction when the data are really anisotropic .",
    "the probability that df method detects pseudo anisotropic signals when the data are actually isotropic is negligible .",
    "the inhomogeneous distribution of data points in the sky almost does not bias the final results .",
    "therefore , the anisotropic signals found in union2.1 using df method is statistically significant .",
    "hc method could nt correctly reproduce the anisotropic direction , although it can approximately reproduce the anisotropic amplitude .",
    "there is a high probability that hc method detects pseudo anisotropic signals when the data are actually isotropic .",
    "the homogeneous distribution of data points in the sky could nt significantly improve this situation .",
    "therefore , the preferred direction found using hc method is questionable .",
    "many reasons may lead to the low statistical significance of hc method .",
    "first , hc method depends on the separation of the sky . due to the limited computational time",
    ", the sky is divided into limited number of pixels .",
    "hc method only compares the directions centering on each pixel , and skips all the other directions .",
    "however , dividing the sky into more pixels could nt significantly improve the results .",
    "second , hc method divides the sky into two opposite hemispheres , and compare the cosmological parameters in each hemisphere .",
    "the parameters derived in this way are the results of the average contribution from one hemisphere , but do not exactly represent the parameters in this specific direction .",
    "third , and maybe more importantly , the redshifts of supernovae in union2.1 are low .",
    "in such a low - redshift range , the distance modulus is insensitive to @xmath4 .",
    "hence , a small noise of distance modulus may lead to a large fluctuation of @xmath4 .",
    "this problem could be solved by adding more high - redshift data such as gamma - ray bursts .    to alleviate the discrepancy between df and hc methods",
    ", we proposed that the matter density can be modeled by the dipole form . by fitting our model to union2.1",
    ", we obtained the direction of maximum @xmath4 pointing towards @xmath133 .",
    "this is well consistent with the dipole direction obtained using df method , but it is about @xmath102 apart from the one obtained using hc method .",
    "this direction is also about @xmath134 away from the direction previously obtained using union2 @xcite .",
    "mc simulations shows that our result is statistically acceptable .",
    "the statistical significance can be further improved if the data points are homogeneously distributed in the sky .",
    "the quality of supernovae data is not high enough . especially , the sky coverage is not complete and the redshift coverage is very narrow",
    ". the anisotropic signals hiding in the supernovae depend on both the methods and data sets .",
    "although the anisotropic signals found using df method could nt be completely contributed to statistical noise , the systematic uncertainty still can not be excluded .",
    "it was shown that the anisotropic signals may completely disappear if the correlations between supernovae are considered @xcite . therefore , according to the present supernovae data , it is premature to claim that the universe has any preferred direction .",
