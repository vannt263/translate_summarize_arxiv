    "the mesons are described as bound states of quarks and antiquarks in the classical quark model . until now",

    "however , there is a growing set of experimental observations of resonance - like structures with quantum numbers which are forbidden for the quark - antiquark ( @xmath11 ) system or situated at masses which can not be explained by the classical quark model  @xcite . from the experimental side , new observations in the heavy quark sector",
    "have reported of several mesons with nonconventional features  @xcite .",
    "mesons with quantum numbers @xmath8 can not be described as simple quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "but , the quantum numbers of these exotic states could be obtained within the hybrid configurations by adding a gluonic excitation to the @xmath11 pair and such exotic hybrid configurations should be observed as additional states in the meson spectrum  @xcite . in the light quark sector",
    "there are three quite well established exotic candidates with @xmath8 : @xmath12 , @xmath9 , and @xmath13 . over the past two decades",
    ", both experimental and theoretical sides have done many efforts to investigate these exotic mesons  @xcite .",

    "however , the clas collaboration at jlab did not find the evidence of @xmath9 state through the photoproduction process @xmath24",
    "@xcite .    within different theoretical approachers",
    ", there are many investigations of the light @xmath25 hybrid meson properties in refs",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "but , the calculations of the mass of the lightest @xmath25 mesons in those works are different . for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is found that the @xmath9 could be the lightest exotic quantum number hybrid meson , while the results in ref .",
    "@xcite favor @xmath12 as the lightest hybrid state .",
    "furthermore , the decay properties of the @xmath25 hybrid state are studied within the framework of the @xmath26 sum rules in ref .",

    "the amplitudes @xmath48 and @xmath49 represent the unitary scattering amplitudes with coupled channels for the interactions of particle 3 with particle 1 and 2 , respectively . in the present work , @xmath48 is the combination of the @xmath50 and @xmath51 unitarized two - body @xmath52 scattering amplitude , while @xmath49 is the @xmath50 and @xmath51 unitarized two - body @xmath43 scattering amplitude . in the above equations , @xmath53 is the loop function for the @xmath1 meson propagating inside the @xmath39 cluster which is discussed below .    for the evaluate of the two body amplitudes @xmath48 and @xmath49 in terms of the unitary amplitudes in the isospin basis , we need first to consider the interaction of a @xmath1 and a @xmath4 cluster .",
