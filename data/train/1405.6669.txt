    ". observe that among the eight basic classes @xmath519 , only @xmath520 and @xmath521 have algebraic intersection @xmath522 with @xmath506 spheres of @xmath504 .",
    "thus , theorem  [ sw1 ] implies that these are only two basic classes that descend to @xmath523 , and consequently to @xmath427 from @xmath497 .    by invoking the connected sum theorem for seiberg - witten invariants",
    ", we see that @xmath524 function is trivial for @xmath469 . since the seiberg - witten invariants are diffeomorphism invariants , @xmath427 is not diffeomorphic to @xmath469 .",
    "the minimality of @xmath427 is a consequence of the fact that @xmath427 has no two seiberg - witten basic classes @xmath253 and @xmath525 such that @xmath526 .",
    "notice that @xmath501 are only basic classes of @xmath427 , and @xmath527 = @xmath528 .",

    "in fact , the sw computation is simpler , since @xmath127 only admits one pair of basic classes .",
