    "on one side are the systems with main sequence be primaries ( be - hmxbs ) .",
    "they are generally wide ( @xmath6d ) eccentric ( eccentricity @xmath70.5 ) systems in which the primaries are not filling their roche lobe , and accretion onto the compact object occurs from the equatorial region of the rapidly rotating be star .",
    "most of these systems are highly variable : in some of them recurrent outbursts are observed caused by an enhanced rate when the compact star passes close to the be star .",
    "on the other side are the systems with an evolved ob supergiant primary ( sghmxb ) .",
    "their periods are shorter ( @xmath8d ) and their orbits more circular than in be - hmxbs .",
    "they are powered either by a geometrically thin accretion disc or by the strong radiation - driven stellar wind , depending on whether the primary fills its roche lobe or not .",
    "their x - ray emission is bright and persistent .",
    "recently , this rather clear - cut picture was made more structured with the integral observations of the galactic plane .",
    "two additional classes were added to the classical ob primary hmxbs : the highly absorbed persistent systems ( walter et al .",
