    "abell  2199 is a nearby rich cluster of galaxies , the central dominant galaxy of which is the cd galaxy , ngc  6166 .",
    "the intracluster gas is of intermediate temperature ( 4.7 kev ; @xcite ) and gives rise to x - ray emission which is strongly peaked on the central galaxy , leading to the suggestion of a strong cluster cooling flow , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "ngc  6166 hosts the radio source 3c338 which has been known for nearly 20 years to have a peculiar morphology @xcite . @xcite",
    "have shown that the radio emission from 3c338 suffers considerable depolarization and faraday rotation which is consistent with the presence of a dense intracluster medium .",
    "@xcite have compared the rosat hri x - ray image with a 5ghz radio map and found evidence for a strong interaction between the radio source and the x - ray emitting gas ( with the x - ray gas disrupting the radio source ) .",
    "they argue that the intracluster medium is being heated by the radio source .",
    "two observations of abell 2199 were made using the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - s ) on the _ chandra _ satellite .",
    "details are given in table  [ obslog ] .",
    "the standard reprocessed level - two events files have been used for analysis after screening for background flares . throughout",
    ", we adopt a redshift for abell 2199 of @xmath50.0309 and a cosmology with @xmath6 and q@xmath7=0.5 , giving an angular diameter distance of 176 mpc and a luminosity distance of 187 mpc .",
    "the linear scale is 850pc per arcsec .    .",
    "log of observations .",
    "the columns show the observation date , observation identification number , observation sequence number , focal plane temperature and exposure time after the observation had been cleaned of background flare events . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the shape of the inner gravitational well around ngc6166 has been probed by the optical spectroscopy of @xcite , who find that the velocity dispersion of the galaxy rises outward .",
    "recently @xcite have confirmed and extended this result .",
    "they found that the velocity dispersion continues to rise out to the limit of their data at 60kpc , by which time the stellar velocity dispersion is close to that of the cluster galaxies .",
    "@xcite note that our measurement of the mass within @xmath8mpc ( where @xmath9 ) is in reasonable agreement with their determination , for the same region .",
    "we next used the best - fitting gravitational potential that was determined above to constrain an image deprojection analysis of the abell 2199 cluster .",
    "we follow the method of @xcite in determining the physical conditions in the cluster as a function of the radius .",
    "the galactic value of the column density is used .",
    "error bars for the derived quantities were determined from one hundred monte carlo replications of the original data .    in fig .",
    "[ sprojprof ] we show the major results from the deprojection analysis .",
    "the input surface brightness distribution is shown in the top panel together with the implied electron density , cooling time and mass deposition rate in lower panels .",
    "the nominal mass deposition rate integrated out to the point where the cooling time is equal to the age of the universe is @xmath10 .",
    "however , the spectral fits ( section 3.1.2 ) place a limit on the mass deposition rate of less than @xmath11 suggesting that any steady state cooling flow must be younger than 23  gyr ( associating the age of the cooling flow with the cooling time of gas where the mass deposition rate from the image deprojection equals that in the spectral fits ) .",
    "we have seen that the radiative cooling time of the gas in abell 2199 is less than about 7  gyr within a radius of 100  kpc , less than 2  gyr within 20  kpc and about 0.1  gyr within the innermost few kpc .",
    "the temperature decreases from above 4  kev beyond 100  kpc to 1.6  kev ( deprojected ) within 5  kpc .",
    "this overall appearance suggests that a cooling flow may be operating ( see e.g. fabian 1994 ) , but the spectral analysis provides only modest support and then only for a small flow of tens @xmath12 .",
    "xmm - newton reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) data of other clusters also show little evidence for long - lived , steady - state cooling flows , in which gas cools from the cluster virial temperature to below @xmath13 by emitting observed x - radiation ( peterson et al .",
    "2001 ; tamura et al . 2001 ; kaastra et al .",
    "the rgs spectra , which do not spatially resolve any flow , are consistent with the gas cooling from the virial temperature to about one third to one fifth of that value but no lower , possibly in a single - phase cooling flow .",
    "the fate of the coolest gas , at 12  kev , is unknown .",
    "it may be heated , mixed with much cooler gas or expelled ( see e.g. fabian et al .",
    "2001b ) .    here",
    "we attempt to quantify upper limits to the amount of multiphase gas in the core of abell 2199 , and to see where the steady - state cooling flow assumption breaks down . using a similar ( projct ) spectral model , accounting for the projection of outer components on to inner regions , to that discussed in section [ spectraldeprojection2 t ] , limits on the volume filling fraction ( @xmath14 ) of any second emission component in the central four spatial bins ( out to 40  kpc from the centre of the cluster ) were calculated using @xmath15^{-1},\\eqno(1)\\ ] ] @xcite .",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are the emission measure and temperature of the first temperature component for a particular shell , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the emission measure and temperature of the additional component .",
    "unlike section [ spectraldeprojection2 t ] we only applied the second emission component to one spatial region at a time .",
    "the second component has a freely fitting normalization and a metal abundance that is fixed to the metal abundance of the first component .",
    "we stepped the temperature of the second component through a range of values from 0.5kev to 2.5kev , calculating @xmath20 and its uncertainty @xmath21 ( obtained by propagating the uncertainties in @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath17 ) . where the value of @xmath20 is less than @xmath24 we plot an upper limit at @xmath24 .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fillfact ] . also shown , in fig .",
    "[ cpcffillfact ] , for comparison , is the continuous differential filling factor distribution expected from a constant pressure cooling flow .",
    "it is clear that there is little evidence for the gas being multiphase at any radius .",
    "( note that the ` detections ' of a second component at some temperatures in the 10 - 20kpc region may be in large part due to the projection of the second component present in the 20 - 40kpc region ) . for a continuous distribution of temperatures",
    "the y - axis is @xmath25 ( fig .  [ cpcffillfact ] ) and",
    "limiting curves lie below the plotted temperature limits which represent the step by step values for one additional temperature component only .",
    "( note also that the test applied in section [ spectraldeprojection2 t ] is different from the test applied here , as in the former each additional component added to outer rings was left in when evaluating the f - statistic for the interior ring , whereas here we have added the second component in for each region separately and then removed it before adding in the second component for the next region ) .",
    "since the temperature distribution appears to be close to single phase , we have then tested whether it resembles a single - phase cooling flow dropping to some minimum temperature @xmath26 .",
    "although the temperature profile ( fig .  [ rmjdeprojdataprof ] ) appears consistent with a single - phase cooling flow , the surface brightness profile is not .",
    "this is the reason that multiphase flows were introduced in the first place ( e.g. fabian , nulsen & canizares 1984 ) .",
    "[ em ] ( solid points ) shows the distribution of emission measure against radius .",
    "we use the normalizations from xspec , which need to be multiplied by @xmath27@xmath28 to convert to @xmath29 .",
    "also plotted is the distribution expected from a single phase cooling flow of @xmath30 , both with and without the gravitational work done included .",
    "to obtain this we use the energy equation of a steady state spherical inflow , @xmath31 @xmath32 is the mean mass per particle , @xmath33 the heating rate ( assumed zero for fig .",
    "[ em ] ) , @xmath34 the emission measure and @xmath35 the gravitational potential , obtained from fig .  [ massprof ] .",
    "we see that the observed emission measure distribution is nowhere as flat as expected from a single - phase flow ( the expected values scale up and down with @xmath36 ) .",
    "there is too little emission at small radii and too much at large radii .",
    "the latter can be explained by any flow not yet having reached a steady - state , but the lack of emission at the centre is more difficult to understand .",
    "we have already shown that spectral fits to the data exclude any simple distributed mass dropout such as expected from a multiphase flow with a mass deposition rate greater than @xmath37 .",
    "however , a flow can be accommodated if the gas , or its emission , can be made to be unobservable .",
    "including absorption is one way to achieve this , and the spectral data allow up to @xmath38 if the emission is absorbed .",
    "the missing soft x - ray luminosity in cooling flows is discussed more extensively by @xcite .",
    "finally , we have quantified the heating required to maintain the gas in a steady state ( fig .",
    "[ heat ] ) , by estimating @xmath33 from equation ( 2 ) . here",
    "a negative value for the heating means that heat has been lost in a non - radiative manner ( for example by mixing with cold gas ) .",
    "_ heating must be distributed over a wide range of radii _ , with a heating rate per unit volume proportional to @xmath39 if there is no mass dropout .",
    "the results are only relevant where some steady - state can be assumed .",
    "note that the radio source , at present , affects the gas distribution in the east - west axis out to about 30  kpc .",
    "the peaked abundance distribution determined from the deprojected spectral analysis , fig .",
    "[ rmjdeprojdataprof ] , argues against much mixing , or convection of gas across the annulus at 2030  kpc .",
    "the whole of the current gas distribution is stable against convection since the entropy , @xmath40 , monotonically increases with radius ( @xmath41 from a few kpc to about 100  kpc since the deprojected gas temperature is approximately @xmath42 and the electron density is @xmath43 where the radius @xmath44 is in kpc ) .",
    "the core of abell 2199 is complex .",
    "some depressions in the x - ray surface brightness are seen to coincide with the radio lobes .",
    "other depressions to the south may indicate earlier radio activity .",
    "the temperature decreases from 4.2  kev to 1.6  kev over radii from 100  kpc to 5  kpc , which is where the radiative cooling time drops from 7  gyr to 0.1  gyr .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness is not sufficiently peaked however to be consistent with a single phase cooling flow .",
    "we find no strong evidence for multiphase gas in the cluster core except in the 20 - 40kpc region where the radio lobes have disturbed the gas most .",
    "we limit the mass deposition rate within the central 100  kpc to @xmath45 .",
    "only if the emission below about 1  kev is somehow undetectable , such as occurs if there is intrinsic absorption , can this rate be significantly increased to around @xmath46 .",
    "we have quantified the heating rate and its distribution in the cluster required to balance cooling if the gas is in a steady state .",
    "however , the situation may not be steady .",
    "any cooling flow is only likely to occur and have become steady within the region where the cooling time is a few billion year or less .",
    "the radio source is clearly causing disruption to the south , east and west of the nucleus .",
    "how much disruption is perhaps indicated by the abundance profile .",
    "our spectral fitting shows that the evidence for two temperatures is almost entirely due to projection effects and fig .",
    "[ rmjdeprojdataprof ] gives the best description of the state of the gas .",
    "the abundance shows a maximum at around 30 kpc . the profile ( which has a similar shape to that seen in the centaurus cluster",
    "; sanders & fabian 2002 ) is consistent with some mixing of gas within , but not much beyond , that radius .",
    "abundance gradients can be due to metal injection by sn ia in the central galaxy @xcite and are expected to show a monotonic increase inward ( unless the metals are poorly mixed and cooling dominates ; morris & fabian 2002 , in preparation ) .",
    "a central decrease can be explained by some exchange of gas between the centre and the region at 4050  kpc ( or further out ) . why intermediate radii have not been similarly affected is puzzling .",
    "massive mixing should however have wiped out the gradient .",
    "the high abundance of the gas at 1040  kpc indicates that it has probably resided close to the centre of the galaxy for an extended period .",
    "we thank stefano ettori for the use of his software to make exposure maps and to extract surface brightness profiles .",
