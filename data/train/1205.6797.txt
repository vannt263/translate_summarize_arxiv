    "coupling a driven quantum mechanical oscillator to environmental fluctuations allows the oscillator dynamics to reach a stationary state . in the stationary state , energy is coherently absorbed from the pump and leaks into the environment via random dissipative transitions , which inevitably induce noise in the resonator .",
    "this occurs even at zero temperature where only environmental zero - point fluctuations ( quantum noise ) exist .",
    "the noise properties of a nonlinear oscillator determine many fundamental nonequilbrium phenomena such as quantum heating @xcite and quantum activation @xcite .",
    "nonlinear oscillators are used as basic elements for quantum state detection or amplification .",
    "examples of those are the josephson bifurcation amplifier @xcite and the cavity bifurcation amplifier @xcite . in this context , the noise properties of the resonator , which is used as detector or amplifier , determine the backaction of the measurement or amplification on the system itself @xcite .",
    "clearly , it is desirable to keep the backaction as weak as possible , while on the other hand , a significant coupling of the amplification or measurement device to the system is useful in order to achieve a sufficiently strong detection or amplification efficiency . a fundamental lower limit for the introduced disturbance , however , will be set by the quantum noise .",
    "hence , in order to design useful concepts for quantum state detection based on nonlinear resonators in the deep quantum regime , their quantum noise properties have to be addressed .",
    "the josephson bifurcation amplifier takes advantage of the dynamically induced bistability due to the nonlinearity of the resonator .",
    "the eigenstates of the qubit are mapped onto the coexisting stable vibrational states of the resonator , which have different amplitudes and phase relations relative to the phase set by the external drive .",
    "hence , they allow for a large discrimination power . up to present",
    ", these amplifying devices mostly operate in a regime where many quanta in the resonator are excited .",
    "this implies that pure quantum fluctuations are typically small on average .",
    "nevertheless , some experiments have been realized at low temperature where the relevant fluctuations are quantum mechanical in nature @xcite .",
    "the regime of weak fluctuations has been the subject of intense theoretical investigation @xcite .",
    "it has been shown , that the stationary distribution over the quasienergy states of the driven oscillator at zero temperature has the form of an effective boltzman distribution , thereby allowing to introduce the concept of an effective quantum temperature implying quantum heating even at @xmath0 .",
    "signatures of the onset of quantum fluctuations can be seen in the relative intensities of the lines of the resonator noise spectrum @xcite and in the appeareance of a fine structure in the spectral lines of resonators with comparatively large nonlinearities and large quality factors @xcite .",
    "the spectral fine structure yields detailed information on the quasienergy distribution @xcite .",
    "recently it has been proposed that nonlinear quantum detectors which operate in the regime of few quanta ( deep quantum regime ) would bring different advantages , such as a small back action , a large discrimination power with an enhanced readout fidelity , and a sufficiently large measurement efficiency @xcite . in the deep quantum regime ,",
    "the frequency - resolved nonlinear response of the oscillator to the external driving with frequency @xmath1 shows a rich fine structure @xcite which is mainly generated by few - photon transitions in the resonator .",
    "the splitting of the typical lorentzian resonance of a harmonic oscillator into a series of non - lorentzian resonances and antiresonances reflects the intrinsic nonequidistance of the energy levels @xmath2 of a nonlinear oscillator . @xmath3-photon transitions with the resonance condition @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and the subsequent drift down along the ladder of the few - photon fock states generate a pronounced nonequilbrium quasienergy distribution which is strongly different from the boltzman - type @xcite . peaks or dips in the nonlinear response",
    "are a direct consequence of the nonequilbrium distribution over states with different oscillation amplitude and phase @xcite .",
    "the signatures of such a characteristic non - lorentzian lineshape of the response has been observed experimentally in a circuit - cavity qed set - up @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the noise properties of modulated nonlinear oscillators in the deep quantum regime .",
    "we consider the simplest example of a monostable anharmonic oscillator which has a quartic nonlinearity ( duffing oscillator ) .",
    "such a weakly nonlinear duffing oscillator has a remarkable symmetry : its energy levels @xmath2 with @xmath6 are pairwise resonant for the same driving frequency @xmath1 , @xmath7 .",
    "an example of the energy spectrum for the case @xmath8 is sketched in fig.[fig1 ] ( a ) . after preparing the oscillator in its @xmath9-th excited state @xmath6 , it displays periodic quantum oscillations between the @xmath9-th and the @xmath10-th excited states . during these oscillations , @xmath11 photons",
    "are being exchanged between the oscillator and the modulation field .",
    "the oscillations of the photon number @xmath12 are usually referred to as multiphoton rabi oscillations .",
    "their characteristic frequency , the rabi frequency @xmath13 , depends on the intensity of the driving field and on the number of photons exchanged .",
    "the rabi frequency @xmath14 for the @xmath3-photon oscillations is the smallest rabi frequency .",
    "the multiphoton rabi oscillations with @xmath10 photons involved are underdamped if their rabi frequency @xmath13 exceeds the dissipative rate of photon leaking into the environment . the latter is the oscillator relaxation rate @xmath15 . for @xmath16",
    "all the rabi oscillations are in general underdamped .",
    "the periodically driven resonator reaches its stationary state on the timescale @xmath17 .    in the stationary state",
    ", quantum noise induces  even at zero temperature  fluctuations in the photon number @xmath12 .",
    "the dynamics of these fluctuations is characterized by multiphoton oscillations which manifest themselves as peaks in the noise spectrum @xmath18 of @xmath12 , located at plus / minus the rabi frequencies @xmath13 . in the underdamped regime ,",
    "the dissipative dynamics of the driven oscillator is most appropriately described in terms of random transitions between the oscillator quasienergy states .",
    "when the driving is resonant , the pairs of oscillator fock states with @xmath9- and @xmath10-photons are resonantly superposed .",
    "the corresponding oscillator quasienergy states are a symmetric and an antisymmetric superposition of the two fock states .",
    "their splitting in quasienergy is given by the rabi frequency @xmath13 .",
    "the corresponding peak in the noise spectrum at @xmath19 is due to random transitions from the state with ( highest ) lowest to that with the ( lowest ) highest quasienergy of the doublet .",
    "the peak intensity is proportional to the stationary occupation probability of the initial quasienergy state .",
    "therefore , the noise spectrum offers a convenient way to directly probe the stationary distribution over all the quasienergy states .",
    "moreover , for weak driving and exactly zero detuning from the multiphoton resonance , the noise spectrum of the @xmath12-photon transition is symmetric , i.e. , @xmath20 and two inelastic peaks are signatures of an oscillatory decay of the fluctuations towards the stationary state .",
    "states belonging to a multiphoton doublet then have the same stationary occupation probabilities . for a weakly detuned modulation or a stronger driving",
    ", the spectrum becomes asymmetric .",
    "besides , an additional quasielastic peak appears at zero frequency which represents incoherent relaxation of the fluctuations towards the stationary state .",
    "these features have some analogy in the spectral correlation function of a ( static ) quantum mechanical two - level system weakly coupled to a dissipative harmonic bath @xcite .",
    "there , the spin correlation function is a sum of three lorentzians .",
    "the two inelastic peaks are symmetrically located at finite frequencies and their width determines the inverse of the dephasing time . in addition , the quasielastic peak at zero frequency represents incoherent relaxation with the inverse relaxation time given by its width . in the driven system ,",

    "in recent years , the rich phenomenology of driven and damped nonlinear quantum oscillators has been impressively consolidated , including their nonlinear response behavior in form of resonant and antiresonant amplification , quantum coherent multiphoton rabi oscillations , quantum activation and quantum heating .",
    "gradually , the nontrivial effects visible in noise correlation functions have also moved to the focus of interest .",
    "those become relevant whenever a nonlinear quantum oscillator is used as a central element in an amplifier or quantum measurement device . in this work , we have analyzed the noise properties of the quantum duffing oscillator in the regine when only few quanta are excited .",
    "then , the nonlinear response shows pronounced multiphoton peaks which are associated to resonant multiphoton rabi oscillations .",
    "the noise properties of these multiphoton transitions show a rich phenomenology . to obtain the noise spectrum by analytical means , we invoke the lax formula for the autocorrelation function of the photon number at different times and calculate its fourier transform .",
    "exactly at a multiphoton resonance , the noise spectrum consists in a collection of pairs of related resonances which are located at opposite frequencies and which are equal in height .",
    "each pair is associated to a multiphoton doublet . in spite of large fluctuations over the oscillator quasienergy ,",
    "no quasielastic peak occurs at zero frequency .",
    "this is a consequence of a special symmetry of the quantum duffing oscillator : all quasienergy states which are associated to a multiphoton doublet have the same mean value of the photon number @xmath12 .    slightly away from a multiphoton resonance ,",
    "the noise spectrum becomes asymmetric and the two resonances are no longer equal in height . in addition , as the mean values of @xmath12 become different for quasienergy states with comparable occupations , the quasielastic peak emerges . since the quasienergy fluctuations are suppressed away from a multiphoton resonance , the intensity of the quasielastic peak as a function of the detuning displays a maximum at the two opposite sides of the resonant value @xmath222 .",
    "our approach also allows us to evaluate the transition to the semiclassical regime by increasing the photon number by a larger driving amplitude .",
