    "consequently the usual axioms of lie transformation groups must be localized .",
    "philosophically speaking , the local point of view is often the most adequate and the richest one , because a given analytico - geometric object often possesses much more local invariant than global invariants , if any . historically speaking , the local lie transformation groups were first studied , before the introduction of the now classical notion of global lie group .",
    "especially , in his first masterpiece work [ lie1880 ] on the subject , sophus lie essentially dealt with local `` lie '' groups : he classified all continuous local transformation groups acting on an open subset of @xmath23 .",
    "this general classification provided afterwards in the years 18801890 many applications to the local study of differential equations : local normal forms , local solvability , _ etc .",
