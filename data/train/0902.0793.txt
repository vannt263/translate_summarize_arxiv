    "relativistic jets in blazars transport energy in the form of bulk motion of protons , leptons and magnetic field . when part of this power is dissipated , the particles emit the beamed radiation we observe , consisting of two broad humps .",
    "the origin of the low frequency hump is well established , believed to be synchrotron radiation from relativistic ( in the comoving frame ) leptons .",
    "the nature of the high energy hump is a controversial issue . in general",
    ", we can group the existing models into three families : i ) the high energy radiation is generated by the same leptons producing the synchrotron , through the inverse compton process ( maraschi , ghisellini & celotti 1992 ; dermer & schlickeiser 1993 ; sikora , begelman & rees 1994 ; ghisellini & madau 1996 ; bloom & marscher 1996 ; celotti & ghisellini 2008 ) ; ii ) there are two populations of leptons , one accelerated directly by the acceleration mechanism ( i.e. shocks ) , and a second one resulting from cascades initiated by ultra  relativistic protons ( mannheim 1993 ; mcke et al .",
    "2003 ; bttcher 2007 ) ; iii ) ultrarelativistic protons emit by the proton  synchrotron process at high energies ( aharonian 2000 ; mcke & protheroe 2001 ) .",
    "another issue of debate is the role of electron  positron pairs .",
    "sikora & madejski ( 2000 ) discussed this problem concluding that , though they can exist , their amount is limited to a few pairs per proton , and a similar conclusion was reached by celotti & ghisellini ( 2008 ) analysing a large number spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for deriving the jet powers of blazars .",
    "this contrasts the idea , originally put forward by blandford & levinson ( 1995 ) that the @xmath0rays spectrum is the superposition of the spectra originating at different distances from the black hole , each one cutted  off at a different @xmath0ray energy as a result of photon  photon absorption . in this scheme",
    "a large amount of pairs is produced , since the high energy hump carries most of the emitted power : if this is partly absorbed , we transform most of the total power into ( energetic ) pairs .",
    "ghisellini & madau ( 1996 ) argued that the blandford & levinson idea has one important observational consequence in powerful blazars with a standard accretion disk : since the pairs are born relativistic , they contribute to the emission mainly by inverse compton scattering the dense uv radiation field coming from the accretion disk .",
    "in fact , if we want the emission region be compact , it is reasonable to locate it close to the accretion disk and its x  ray corona .",
    "this implies that the coronal x ",
    "rays are targets for the @xmath0@xmath2 process , and that the accretion disk uv photons become seeds for the scattering made by the newly born pairs .",
    "the resulting radiation is mainly in the x  ray band , that should have a power comparable to the power absorbed in the @xmath0ray band , contrary to what observed .",
    "this led ghisellini & madau ( 1996 ) to conclude that the dissipation region in blazar jets can not be very close to the accretion disk . on the other hand the observed fast variability argues for not too large distances .",
    "taken together , these two limits strongly suggest that there is a preferred distance at which _",
    "the @xmath0ray radiation is produced _",
    ", at some hundreds of  radii .",
    "since this argument makes use of the reprocessed radiation produced by the pairs , it can not be applied when most of the radiation is produced below the pair production energy threshold and/or if the accretion disk is radiatively inefficient : in both cases very few pairs are created .",
    "indeed , katarzynski & ghisellini ( 2007 ) proposed a jet model in which a dissipation close to the accretion disk resulted in a low level @xmath0ray emission , with no contradiction with the existing x  ray data .    these arguments , although correct , are qualitative , and in our opinion a detailed computation of the reprocessing due to pairs is not yet present in the literature .",
    "therefore one of the aims of the present paper is to derive some limits on the location of the dissipation region in the jet of powerful blazars .",
    "we will do it in the framework of the  leptonic \" class of models [ family i ) mentioned above ] , and we limit our analysis to blazars having a  standard \" ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) accretion disk .",
    "this implies to consider flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs , and their likely parent population , fr ii radio  galaxies ) and not bl lac objects , that are likely to have radiatively inefficient accretion flows ( see celotti & ghisellini 2008 and ghisellini & tavecchio 2008 for more discussion about this point ) .",
    "while doing this , we will study the relative importance of different sources of seed photons as a function of the distance @xmath3 of the dissipation region from the black hole , and their spectrum as seen in the comoving frame .",
    "this is the second aim of the paper . besides the radiation coming directly from the accretion disk and its x  ray corona",
    ", we will consider the radiation produced in the broad line region ( blr ) and in a relatively more distant dusty torus , intercepting a fraction of the disk radiation and re  emitting it in the infrared .",
    "finally , we also include the contribution of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , important for very large ( beyond 1 kpc ) @xmath3 .",
    "the term `` canonical high power blazars '' refers to the rather standard choice for both the environment of these sources and their jets :    1 .",
    "the accretion disk is a standard ,  shakura & syunyaev \" ( 1973 ) disk .",
    "2 .   above this accretion disk",
    ", there is an x  ray corona , emitting a luminosity less than , but comparable to , the luminosity emitted by the accretion disk .",
    "the blr and the ir torus are located at distances that scale as the square root of the disk luminosity ( bentz et al .",
    "2006 ; kaspi et al .",
    "2007 ; bentz et al . 2008",
    "; see the discussion about this point made in ghisellini & tavecchio 2008 ) .",
    "4 .   the jet is assumed to dissipate only a fraction of its total power , which is then conserved .",
    "after the acceleration phase , possibly magnetic in origin , we assume that also the poynting flux is conserved ( see e.g. celotti & ghisellini 2008 ) .",
    "our study is not completely new , since several of its  ingredients \" have already been discussed in the literature .",
    "the paper more german to our is dermer et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , but we include some new ingredients .",
    "the novel features of our investigation concern mainly : i ) the inclusion of the x  ray corona as an important producer of target photons for the @xmath0@xmath2 process ; ii ) the calculation of the emitting particle distribution , including pair creation ; iii ) the effects of jet acceleration at small distances from the black hole ; iv ) the strict link between the properties of the accretion disk and the amount of the external radiation and v ) the overall scenario allowing to describe in a more general way ( than done before ) the sed properties of high power jets at all scales .",
    "the paper is divided into four parts .",
    "in the first we study the different sources of external radiation , and the corresponding energy densities , as seen in the comoving frame , as a function of distance from the black hole and as a function of the bulk lorentz factor of the jet . in the second part of the paper we investigate the role of pair production processes when the dissipation region is close to the black hole , with the aim to find quantitative constraints .",
    "in the third part we construct the expected sed as a function of distance , highlightening what are the relevant external seed photons . finally ,",
    "in the fourth part , we apply some of the above results and considerations when modelling the sed of some blazars , used as illustrative examples , and we check if our scenario can reproduce the phenomenological blazar sequence ( fossati et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "we use a cosmology with @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we also use the notation @xmath6 in cgs units , unless noted otherwise .",
    "our model is characterised by the following setup .",
    "the accretion disk extends from @xmath7 to @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the  radius ) and is producing a total luminosity @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the accretion rate and @xmath12 is the accretion efficiency .",
    "locally , its emission is black  body , with a temperature @xmath13\\ ] ] below and above the accretion disk there is a hot corona , emitting uv and x ",
    "rays with a luminosity @xmath14 . for simplicity ,",
    "the corona is assumed to be homogeneous between 3 and 30  radii .",
    "the spectrum is assumed to be a cut  off power law : @xmath15 .",
    "the broad line region ( blr ) is assumed to be a shell located at a distance @xmath16 it reprocesses a fraction @xmath17 of @xmath18 in lines , especially the hydrogen lyman@xmath19 line , and continuum .",
    "following tavecchio & ghisellini ( 2008 ) , we assume that the spectral shape of the blr observed in the comoving frame is a black  body peaking at a factor @xmath20 times the ( rest frame ) frequency of the lyman@xmath19 line .",
    "we also assume the presence of a torus ( see bazejowski et al .",
    "2000 ; sikora et al .",
    "2002 ) , at a distance @xmath21 reprocessing a fraction @xmath22 of the disk radiation in the infrared .",
    "note that both @xmath23 and @xmath24 scale as the square root of @xmath18 : this implies that , in the lab frame , the radiation energy densities of these two components are constant , as long as @xmath3 is smaller than these two radii .",
    "we emphasise that our treatment of the torus emission is approximate : it is likely that the torus itself is a complex structure , possibly clumpy ( nenkova et al .",
    "2008 ) with a range of radii , extending also quite close to the black hole , where the temperature is just below dust sublimation ( i.e. @xmath25 k ) .",
    "our approach follows in part the results of cleary et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , finding weak signs of hot dust emission in the studied spectra , and partly is dictated by simplicity .",
    "the emitting region is moving with a velocity @xmath26 corresponding to a bulk lorentz factor @xmath20 .",
    "we call @xmath3 the distance of the dissipation region from the black hole .",
    "we consider either a constant @xmath20 or include an acceleration phase of the kind ( see e.g. komissarov et al .",
    "2007 ; vlahakis & knigl 2004 ) : @xmath27\\ ] ] when the acceleration phase is taken into account , the jet is assumed to be parabolic in shape , becoming conical when @xmath20 reaches its maximum value ( see e.g. vlahakis & knigl 2004 ) .",
    "calling @xmath28 the cross sectional radius of the jet , and @xmath29 the distance from the black hole , we have @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the semi  aperture angle of the jet in its conical part , and the constant @xmath32 is fixed by assuming that at the start of the jet we have @xmath33 . the parabolic and conical parts of the jet connect at @xmath34 .    the total power carried by the jet , @xmath35 , was assumed in ghisellini & tavecchio ( 2008 ) to be related to the mass accretion rate , i.e. @xmath36 . since celotti & ghisellini ( 2008 ) found that @xmath35 is greater than the disk accretion luminosity , i.e. @xmath37 , we assumed ( in ghisellini & tavecchio 2008 ) that @xmath38 was greater than the corresponding efficiency of transforming the accretion rate @xmath11 in disk luminosity .",
    "when fitting the data of specific sources , we do not specify a priori the total jet luminosity , which is instead a result of the modelling ( once we assume how many protons there are for each emitting lepton ) .",
    "therefore @xmath35 is not an input parameter in our scheme , but it is a quantity derived a posteriori .",
    "what we will specify , instead , is the power injected in the dissipation region , that is related to the power carried by the jet in relativistic electrons ( and by cold protons , once we specify how many protons there are per emitting electron ) .",
    "we assume a value of the magnetic field in the dissipation region , that corresponds to a poynting flux @xmath39 .",
    "if the jet is magnetically accelerated , then the initial ( i.e. close to @xmath40 ) @xmath39 should be of the same order of @xmath35 , becoming @xmath41const when @xmath20 reaches its maximum value . to describe the profile of @xmath39 we assume the following prescription : @xmath42\\ ] ] in this way @xmath43 initially , becoming a constant fraction @xmath44 of @xmath35 when the jet is conical .",
    "here @xmath45 is the magnetic energy density .",
    "the energy distribution of the particles responsible for the emission is derived through the continuity equation , assuming a continuous injection of particles throughout the source lasting for a finite time .",
    "this time is the light crossing time @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the size of the emitting blob , located at the distance @xmath3 from black hole .",
    "we always calculate the particle distribution at this time .",
    "the reason for this approach is suggested by the fast variability shown by blazars , indicating that the release of energy is short and intermittent . besides , we believe that this approach is the simplest that can nevertheless describe in some detail the particle distribution .",
    "in fact , it allows to neglect : i ) adiabatic losses ( important after @xmath48 , which is also the time needed to double the radius ) ; ii ) particle escape ( again important for times longer than @xmath48 ) and iii ) the changed conditions in the emitting region ( since the source is travelling and expanding , the magnetic field changes ) .",

    "the spectrum is dominated by the synchrotron emission , with a small fraction of the power being emitted above the pair production energy threshold .",
    "this in turn implies that early ( i.e. close to the black hole ) dissipation is not an efficient mechanism to produce electron  positron pairs . since a small @xmath20 means small doppler boosting , the produced spectra at small distances are undetectable , overwhelmed by the emission of more distant and fastly moving components .    when @xmath20 is large , therefore for the @xmath194 case , the relevant absorbing photons are those of the broad line region , with a very modest contribution from the coronal x",
    " rays reflected by the blr material .",
    "the overall effect is marginal .",
    "we can conclude that a  canonical \" jet can dissipate part of its kinetic energy even at small distances .",
    "one way to avoid strong pair production is to have small electron energies , emitting a small power above the pair production threshold .",
    "alternatively , if the jet is accelerating , and close to the black hole it has a modest @xmath20factor , the produced radiation is hardly observable because the doppler boost is limited . in relative terms , the synchrotron luminosity should be dominant , with a small fraction of power being emitted at high energies .",

    "we pointed out that when the dominant contribution to the seed photon for scattering is given by the blr , the hydrogen lyman@xmath19 photons are the most prominent ones .",
    "the fact that there is a characteristic frequency of the seed photons allows to easily calculate when the klein  nishina effects ( decrease of the scattering cross section with energy ) are important . for completeness , we briefly repeat here the argument , with the aim to extend it to cases in which @xmath3 is beyond the blr , and as a consequence , the relevant seed photons becomes the ir ones .    in the comoving frame , and as long as we are within the blr ,",
    "the observed seed lyman@xmath19 frequency is observed at @xmath196 . to be in the thomson scattering regime",
    "we require that @xmath197 if the random lorentz factor @xmath0 of the electron satisfies this condition , the energy of the scattered photon is @xmath198 above this energy , the spectrum steepens due to the decreased efficiency of the scattering process .",
    "this may well mimic the effect of photon  photon absorption , making it difficult to discriminate between the two effects .",
    "consider also that the lyman@xmath19 photons are the best targets for the photon ",

    "we can repeat the very same argument assuming that the relevant seed photons are the ones produced by the ir torus .",
    "this occurs when the dissipation region is beyond the blr but within @xmath24 . in this case",
    "the relevant frequency is @xmath199 hz and we can rewrite eq .",
    "[ kn ] as @xmath200 this implies that , if we do see a spectrum which is unbroken even above @xmath201 gev , we can conclude that the dissipation region is beyond the blr .",
    "also in this case , the  intrinsic \" absorption due to the @xmath0@xmath0 process is expected to become important at @xmath202 .",
    "there is therefore a range , between @xmath201 and @xmath203 gev , in which the intrinsic spectrum should not suffer from the klein ",

    "these sources are thus the best candidates for studying the photon  photon absorption due to the cosmic optical ",
    "uv background radiation .",
    "although there are strong indications that _ most _ of the observed radiation originates in a well localised region of the jet , there is also compelling evidence that the jet dissipates also in other regions , larger and more distant from its base .",
    "in fact , in the radio band , we do see bright knots at different distances contributing to form the characteristic flat total radio spectrum of the entire jet , and we do observed optical and x  ray knots also at hundreds of kpc from the jet apex . the power associated to these , often resolved , features is a small fraction of the total observed jet bolometric luminosity , but in specific bands the flux produced at larger distances can be comparable to the flux produced in the most active region .",
    "it is therefore instructive to calculate the predicted spectrum as a function of distance , extending our analysis well beyond the region of influence of the ir flux produced by the torus , and therefore analysing the effects of the radiation energy density of the cosmic background radiation ( cmb ) .",

    "[ cmb ] ) , corresponding to the fast drop of the energy density of the external radiation between these two distances .    sed 5 ( @xmath231 , or 1 kpc ) has again a relatively large compton dominance , due to the prevailing of the cmb and the starlight ( from the galaxy bulge ) energy densities over the magnetic one .",

    "the fact that we did not see this kind of sed in gb 1428 + 4217 suggests that this state rarely occurs .",
    "this is particularly true considering that this blazars was not discovered because it was particularly bright in hard x  rays or in the @xmath0ray band , so there was no bias against a soft x ",
    "ray spectrum .",

    "as done for gb 1428 + 4217 , we show what we considered the best fitting model ( black line in the top panel ) corresponding to @xmath269 cm , ( corresponding to 800 @xmath9 for the assumed black hole mass of @xmath270 ) , and also the models corresponding to a tenfold increase ( decrease ) of @xmath3 ( light grey lines in the top panel and vertical lines in the bottom panel ) .",
    "the bat data have large error bars , precluding the possibility to firmly claim that its high energy peak is within the bat energy range ( namely , at @xmath266 kev ) , but this possibility is indeed suggested by the present data .",
    "the sed of this source can be explained by a set of parameters similar to the ones chosen for gb 1428 + 4217 , and similar considerations apply .",
    "increasing @xmath3 tenfold makes the ir radiation from the torus to dominate , leaving almost unchanged the ratio between the radiation and the magnetic energy densities ( and thus the corresponding ec to synchrotron luminosity ratio ) . again",
    "a decrease in @xmath3 by a factor 10 has a dramatic impact on the predicted sed , dominated in this case by the synchrotron luminosity ( see also the bottom panel ) .",

    "we can ask if our  canonical \" jet can reproduce the phenomenological blazar sequence as proposed by fossati et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ( see also donato et al . 2001 and ghisellini et al . 1998 ) .",
    "this sequence was constructed by taking flux limited samples of blazars ( in the radio and x  ray bands ) , dividing the sources in radio luminosity bins , and averaging the flux of the sources in each ( radio luminosity ) bin at selected frequencies .",
    "the resulting data are shown in fig .",
    "[ sequence ] . as discussed in ghisellini & tavecchio ( 2008 ) and in maraschi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , this sequence does not pretend to describe  the average blazar \" , since it likely represents the most beamed sources , successfully entering in the flux limited sample they belong to .",
    "nevertheless it is appropriate to ask if our  canonical \" jet can reproduce this sequence without strong modifications of the basic assumptions .",
    "[ sequence ] then shows the sed resulting from our modelling , whose parameters are listed in tab . [ para ] .",
    "as can be seen the agreement is quite good , and it is achieved by assuming ( as in ghisellini & tavecchio 2008 ) , that the accretion disk becomes radiatively inefficient below some critical accretion rate ( thus around a critical luminosity in units of the eddington one , that we take as a few @xmath271 ) .",
    "the first three , more powerful , sed correspond to sources with a standard disk , while for the two sed at lower luminosities we have  switched  off \" all external radiation .",
    "the black hole mass is @xmath272 for the two most powerful sed , and is @xmath273 for the other three .",
    "the luminosity , in the comoving frame , injected in relativistic electrons is monotonically decreasing , as the value of the magnetic field .",
    "the dissipation radius @xmath3 , in units of the  radius , changes slightly , but less than a factor 2.5 .",
    "the energy of the injected particles need to increase as the cooling decreases .",
    "the decreased cooling also makes @xmath50 to increase .",
    "these effects are very important for the two  bl lac \" sed , and much less for the other three most luminous seds .",
    "we can conclude that the blazar sequence , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ sequence ] , can be interpreted as a sequence of jet powers , in sources having more or less the same ( large ) black hole mass .",
    "the jet power correlates with the accretion disk luminosity and below some critical value the disk changes accretion regime , becoming radiatively inefficient and unable to photo  ionise the broad line clouds . a intriguing manifestation of this behavior is shown by the bright blazars recently detected by the _",
    "fermi _ satellite ( abdo et al .",
    "2009 ) discussed in ghisellini , maraschi & tavecchio ( 2009 ) , and mirrors what has been suggested to occur for the fri  frii radio  galaxy divide ( ghisellini & celotti 2001 ) .",
    "our aim was to describe the main properties of the produced spectrum in a  canonical \" jet .",
    "specific sources can of course deviate somewhat by our description . for instance :    * assuming @xmath274 , may be approximately obeyed on average , but specific sources might behave differently . the assumed jet geometric profile and the assumption that the jet , at its start , is magnetically dominated could be two oversimplifications .",
    "we hope to test these assumptions by direct observations , since the combined efforts of the _ fermi _ and _ swift _ satellites can give us really simultaneous spectra on a large frequency band .",
    "* we have assumed that the  dissipation \" mechanism , converting some fraction of the jet power into radiation , has the form of an injection of primary leptons lasting for a light crossing time . with this assumption",
    ", we have derived the particle distribution at this time , which corresponds to the maximum produced flux . however , the injection can last for a longer or shorter time .",
    "our framework is appropriate for describing a  snapshot \" of the sed , and not for a time ",
    "dependent analysis . *",
    "we assume that the magnetic field in the dissipation region is the same as the magnetic field transported by the jet .",
    "it is not amplified by e.g. shocks , nor it is reduced by e.g. reconnection events ( see e.g. giannios , uzdensky & begelman 2009 ) . although we can assume any value of the magnetic field in the dissipation region ( i.e. we can fix any value in the numerical code calculating the sed ) , we prefer this choice for all the examples shown , because of simplicity .",
    "* we focused on high power blazars , thought to have ",
    "standard \" accretion disks and broad line regions , and therefore we did not discuss in detail the expected sed from low power ( and tev emitting ) bl lacs .",
    "however , we could simply extend our study to these sources if we  switch",
    " off \" the external radiation components , as expected if the accretion disk becomes radiatively inefficient , making very weak or absent broad emission lines . in fig .",
    "[ sequence ] we indeed show two examples of the expected spectra in this case . *",
    "all the shown sed do not take into account the absorption of @xmath0rays due to the ir , optical and uv background , but only the  internal \" absorption caused by the radiation fields existing close to the emitting blob .",
    "* we have always assumed a relatively small viewing angle ( @xmath275 ) , of the same order of @xmath276 .",
    "since @xmath20 and @xmath159 are two separated input parameters , we could change @xmath159 ( and thus the doppler factor @xmath277 ) for a fixed @xmath20 .",
    "however , this would introduce a delicate issue , since the external radiation field , in the comoving frame , is not isotropic .",
    "if the emitting blob is inside the blr , for instance , then all external photons appear to come from one direction , and we could apply the formalism of dermer ( 1995 ) to describe the pattern of the scattered radiation . note that , in this case , if @xmath278 ( and thus @xmath279 ) one has the observed luminhosity as for radiation isotropic in the rest frame . on the other hand ,",
    "if the emitting region is beyond the blr , then the arrival directions of the blr external photons are spread , and it is not trivial to reconstruct the exact pattern .",
    "but in this cases the blr component is hardly dominant with respect to the ir radiation from the torus .",
    "we have decided , for simplicity , to use @xmath162 , and to treat the emitted radiation pattern is the same way as for an isotropic seed photon distribution .",
    "* we neglected , for simplicity , the possibility of a jet composed by a fast spine surrounded by a slower layer .",
    "this structured jet have been proposed for low power bl lacs and fr i radio  galaxies ( ghisellini , tavecchio & chiaberge 2005 ) , and can ease some problems in explaining the sed properties in these sources . while in high power blazars there is no compelling need , yet , for such a structure , its inclusion in the present study would make our description much more complex and model  dependent , given the freedom to choice the parameters for the layer emission .",
    "* for simplicity , we neglected the possibility that the blr and the associated inter  cloud material can absorb and re - emit , or scatter , part of the synchrotron radiation produced by the jet ( i.e. the  mirror model \" , see ghisellini & madau 1996 , and some criticism by bednarek 1998 ; bttcher & dermer 1998 ) .",
    "* the jet , even if cold ( i.e. before dissipation ) , is relativistic , and the carried leptons could scatter the external radiation by bulk comptonization .",
    "this process , proposed by begelman & sikora ( 1987 ) and sikora et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and studied in detail in celotti , ghisellini & fabian ( 2007 ) , could produce a black  body like component in the x  ray band , whose level depends on how the jet accelerates and on the amount of leptons carried by the jet .",
    "we have neglected this component for simplicity , although it can be a very important diagnostic for deriving , at the same time , the bulk lorentz factor of the jet and its matter content .",
    "the relatively recent observations of blazars , especially in the @xmath0ray band , have disclosed some of the crucial ingredient for our understanding of jets , namely the bolometric power output and the real shape of the produced sed . although there is still discussion about the origin of the high energy emission of blazars , the relatively simple one  zone leptonic model was rather successful to interpret the existing data of specific sources .    in this paper , rather than modelling single sources , we tried to propose a more general description of the emission produced by high power jets . for this aim",
    "we have first summarised in a simple way the expected radiation fields as a function of the distance from the black hole , and then we have studied how the expected sed changes if the main dissipation occurs at different locations in the jet .",
    "we have done this by assuming rather reasonable prescription for the accretion disk and its x  ray corona emission , and using reasonable prescriptions for the radiation fields corresponding to the broad line region and the infrared torus .",
    "we have also assumed that the jet conserves its poynting flux at all distances , thus fixing the profile of the magnetic field . since all these prescriptions correspond to rather uncontroversial assumptions",
    ", we believe that they should well characterise the properties of an average , canonical , large power jet .",
    "the main conclusions of our work are :    * the magnetic energy density is always smaller than the external radiation energy densities , except at the very beginning of the jet and at the kpc scale . beyond these scales ,",
    "the contribution of the cosmic microwave background becomes dominant . *",
    "the inclusion of the x  ray radiation from the disk corona allowed to quantify the effect of pair production and reprocessing for small @xmath3 .",
    "this is found to be severe if the primary spectrum emits most of its power at energy above the pair production threshold .",
    "this requires that the bulk lorentz factor is large even in the very vicinity of the black hole . in this case",
    "there is a transfer of power from the @xmath0ray to the x  ray band .",
    "our quantitative analysis confirms earlier , more qualitative , statements concerning the non  dissipative nature of the inner ( i.e. up to a few hundreds  radii ) jet . *",
    "if instead the jet accelerates gradually ( i.e. as @xmath280 up to a maximum value ) , the magnetic energy density dominates the cooling at the start of the jet , resulting in a synchrotron dominated sed , with a very small fraction of power being emitted above the pair production energy threshold .",
    "these sed would hardly be detectable , since the small @xmath20 means a much reduced doppler enhancement of the flux , and thus these components are easily overtaken by the emission at larger distances ( that have a larger @xmath20 ) . in any case , early dissipation ( i.e. small @xmath3 ) is not an efficient process to create electron  positron pairs . *",
    "besides the inner part of the jet , the  internal \" pair absorption ( i.e. calculated within the emitting blob ) can be particularly important also if dissipation takes place close to ( but within ) the blr and close to ( but within ) @xmath191 . in these cases , however , a small fraction of the emitted power can be absorbed , and the reprocessing is modest . *",
    "the klein ",
    "nishina decrease ( with energy ) of the scattering cross section imprints a characteristic steepening in the spectrum above @xmath253 gev if the dissipation takes place within the blr , and at @xmath258 tev if the dissipation occurs beyond the blr but within @xmath24 .",
    "* the above point has important consequences on the possible use of the high energy ( gev ) data of blazars to study the optical  uv background .",
    "in fact the signature of the @xmath0@xmath0 absorption due to this component would be a rather sharp steepening of the received spectrum , that would be very similar to the intrinsic steepening of the primary spectrum due to klein  nishina effects _",
    "if most of the dissipation takes place within the blr_. in this case also the  internal \" @xmath0@xmath0 absorption due to blr photons will be relevant",
    ". it will be very difficult to disentangle these effects .",
    "on the other hand , if the observed spectrum continues unbroken above @xmath281 gev , we can infer that most of the dissipation has occurred beyond @xmath23 . in this case both klein  nishina and  internal \" absorption effects are unimportant up to the tev band .",
    "these therefore would be the best candidates to study the opt  uv cosmic backgrounds . * the magnetic field decreases with distance , while the @xmath83 is approximately constant up to @xmath23 , and @xmath105 is approximately constant up to @xmath24 . at these distances ( i.e. @xmath190 and @xmath191 ) the compton dominance is very large .",
    "existing observations of large power blazars already indicate that these blazars are characterised by a weak synchrotron component , a strong thermal , disk component ( unhidden by the synchrotron flux ) and a very large high energy flux .",
    "these are the sources with the largest compton dominance , strongly suggesting that @xmath3 is relatively large ( i.e. close to the @xmath23 or @xmath24 ) .",
    "this helps to understand why in these sources the soft x ",
    "rays are relatively weak and very hard , demanding a very weak ssc flux : since the magnetic field is small , not only the synchrotron , but also the ssc flux is small with respect to the ec radiation . * concerning the above point",
    ", the fact that the high power blazars we already know of have the mentioned properties does not imply that they preferentially dissipate at large distances with respect to less powerful sources , since we may have selected them on the basis of their hard x  ray or @xmath0ray flux ( therefore taking advantage of the large compton dominance they have when @xmath3 is large ) . in other words : they may dissipate at different @xmath3 at different times , but we select them only when @xmath3 is large . * although most of the dissipation should take place in one zone of the jet ( with @xmath2825001000 @xmath9 ) , it is very likely that dissipation occurs also at larger distances , albeit with less power .",
    "the flux originating in these zones can be important in some frequency bands , as the soft x ",
    "ray one , with important consequences on the observed variability . instead , in the @xmath0ray energy band ( at least when the @xmath0ray dominates the bolometric output ) most of the flux should originate in one zone . *",
    "blazars with large masses should be characterised by the largest inverse compton to synchrotron ratios , and thus they will be well represented in @xmath0ray all sky surveys , as performed by the _",
    "fermi _ satellite . * the most powerful blazars , with the most powerful associated accretion disk , should have a high energy hump peaking in the 100 kev1 mev energy range .",
    "the exact location of the peak frequency depends somewhat on @xmath3 , being smaller if dissipation occurs beyond the blr .",
    "these blazars should form the high power extension of the blazar sequence .",
    "they _ are not _ easily detectable by the _",
    "fermi _ satellite , since their mev peak implies relatively small fluxes in the gev band .",
    "the brightest of them have already been revealed by the serendipitous survey of the bat instrument onboard _ swift_. * the phenomenological blazar sequence as presented in fossati et al .",
    "( 1998 ) can be interpreted as a sequence of  canonical jets \" in sources with more or less the same ( large ) black hole mass , but with different accretion rates and different jet powers .",
