    "recently , the d0 collaboration has reported a narrow peak in the @xmath0 mass spectrum , denoted as @xmath1 , based on their 104 fb@xmath13 data of @xmath14 collision at @xmath15  tev accumulated at the fermilab tevatron collider @xcite . the resulting mass and width of this peak",
    "were determined as [ eq : pole position ] m_x&=&5567.82.9^+0.9_-1.9,_x&=&21.96.4^+5.0_-2.5 , respectively , and the spin - parity assignment @xmath16 was used in the data analysis ( with @xmath17 also discussed ) .",
    "in fact , the quantum numbers @xmath18 have not been well determined yet .",
    "the statistical significance was found to be @xmath19 , including look - elsewhere effect and systematic uncertainties @xcite .",
    "the decay of @xmath1 to @xmath0 suggests that it has four valence quarks with different flavors : @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "if finally the existence of the @xmath1 is confirmed , this will be the first observation of a resonance with all these quark flavors .",
    "this new finding has triggered the interest of theorists , and many interpretations have been proposed .",
    "particularly , motivated by the aforementioned four quark components , one has models for tetraquark states @xcite , which typically show that their outcome is compatible with the experimental mass . through a comparison between the molecular assignment and the diquark - antidiquark scenario within qcd sum rules ,",
    "the tetraquark state is advocated in ref .",
    "although a four - quark ( @xmath22[\\bar b\\bar d]$ ] ) state with @xmath16 was found about 150 mev higher than the @xmath12 using the diquark - antidiquark interaction in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors also claimed that the state is still likely to be identified as the @xmath12 once systematic errors in the model are considered .",
    "this state has also been analyzed within the quark model to further investigate the tetraquark components @xcite . in the former reference",
    "the calculated mass for @xmath12 is rather close to the experimental one , but the author also asks in the paper for a more elaborated model for the @xmath23 system .",
    "the subsequent calculation in the relativized quark model @xcite finds that the masses of @xmath24 tetraquark states are much higher than the one of @xmath1 , and thus the interpretation as a diquark - antidiquark state is disfavored .",
    "later the dispute becomes more severe as lhcb fails to confirm such peak @xcite using its 3 fb@xmath13 @xmath25 collision data at @xmath26 and 8 tev .",
    "in fact , several theoretical investigations e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite point out that none of the models , including the threshold and cusp effects , molecular and tetraquark ones , give a satisfactory description of the @xmath1 .    already ref .",
    "@xcite discussed the possibility of the @xmath12 being generated from the @xmath27-wave coupled - channel transition of @xmath28 , and performed a corresponding calculation within the nonrelativistic quark model .",
    "the authors concluded that this scenario is unlikely .",
    "this idea has been also implemented in the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath27-wave potential between @xmath5 and @xmath29 was calculated in the leading - order heavy meson chiral perturbation theory ( hmchpt ) , and then unitarized with the method of ref .",
    "the free parameter , a subtraction constant or a three - momentum cutoff , is fitted to the experimental data on the @xmath0 invariant - mass spectrum .",
    "it turns out that an unnaturally large cutoff , much larger than 1 gev , is unavoidably needed to reproduce the mass of the resonance ( with the resulting width in agreement with experiment ) . in this sense",
    ", the @xmath1 is hard to be assigned as a dynamically generated resonance by the @xmath27-wave @xmath30 scattering , disfavoring the molecular interpretation .",
    "in fact , the quantum numbers @xmath18 for the resonance have not been determined unambiguously yet .",
    "the assignments @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) or @xmath17 ( @xmath33 followed by @xmath34 ) from ref .",
    "@xcite are purely based on fitting the resonance signal in the @xmath0 event distribution with an @xmath27-wave breit - wigner ( bw ) function .",
    "we have also performed a purely phenomenological fit to the data of ref .",
    "@xcite in terms of a @xmath4-wave bw parameterization of the signal function with the same mass and width as in eq .  , and",
    "show that a reproduction nearly as good as the one assuming an @xmath27-wave bw results .",
    "in other terms , the current data is not capable of unambiguously pinning down the quantum numbers ( and in particular the intrinsic parity ) of the @xmath12 .",
    "another point that we want to stress here is that the mass threshold of @xmath35 is below the pole position of @xmath1 only by around 10 mev , closer indeed to the @xmath1 mass than the @xmath36 threshold .",
    "thus , from a `` molecular '' perspective for the generation of the @xmath12 it is suggestive to look for a coupled - channel - scattering scenario involving simultaneously @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "however , in order to conserve angular momentum and parity it is necessary at least a @xmath4-wave to couple both channels .",
    "it is typically considered that the @xmath4-wave scattering between @xmath5 and @xmath6 is small in the @xmath12 region because their three - momenta are small . however , the off - diagonal transitions involving the heavier @xmath37 and @xmath38 states have much larger _",
    "unphysical _ three - momenta , determined by analytical continuation .",
    "this motivates our current study in coupled channels within hmchpt to study the isovector @xmath4-wave scattering between the channels @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we also discuss that the subtraction constant per channel appearing in the unitarization process can be pinned down reliablly by imposing an @xmath9-channel crossing symmetry constraint , similarly as done in refs .",
    "the numerical values obtained in this way are also quite closed to the natural values that stem from a three - momentum cut - off around 1  gev @xcite .",
    "we conclude from our research that an explanation of the @xmath12 as dynamically generated resonance in @xmath4-wave scattering is not plausible .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ p - wave scenario ] , we discuss the reproduction of the d0 data employing a @xmath4-wave bw parameterization for the signal function .",
    "next we move to hmchpt in order to calculate the leading - order tree - level amplitudes projected in @xmath4-wave ( sec .",

    "[ sec : results ] . at last",
    ", we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the @xmath6 mass threshold is very close to the pole position of the @xmath1 , as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the coupling of @xmath6 to @xmath39 requires at least a @xmath4-wave , because @xmath27-wave is not allowed due to angular momentum and parity conservation .",
    "these observations encourage us to reexamine the interpretation of the experimental data with @xmath0 in @xmath4 wave and not in @xmath27 wave , as originally performed by the d0 collaboration @xcite . in this form",
    "the vector and pseudoscalar heavy mesons could scatter between each other within @xmath4-wave coupled - channel scattering ( as analyzed in detail below in sec .",
    "[ sec : potential ] and [ sec : results ] ) .    before proceeding to the @xmath4-wave case , we review the formalism used by the d0 collaboration @xcite in fitting the invariant mass distribution of @xmath0 assuming @xmath27-wave .",
    "the original full data contains both the background and the resonance signal .",
    "the extraction of the latter was done by fitting data without and with the `` cone cut '' , as introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to enhance the resonance signal .",
    "both background components , that result with or without this cut , can be well parameterized as @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the invariant mass of @xmath0 ( we use this shorthand notation in the following , if not otherwise stated ) .",
    "this parameterization reproduces perfectly well the background in all cases @xcite .",
    "a bw parameterization for a resonance of mass @xmath42 and width @xmath43 near the two - body threshold with orbital angular momentum @xmath44 can be written as @xmath45 this is written in terms of the mass - dependent width , which reads @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the magnitude of the center - of - mass ( cm ) three - momentum of @xmath0 with invariant mass @xmath48 , see eq .",

    "analogously to ref .",
    "@xcite we first fit the full data with the function @xmath51 where the resonance signal is parameterized in terms of an @xmath27-wave bw times a normalization constant @xmath52 .",
    "the background is given in terms of @xmath53 , cf .",
    "eq .  , times the constant @xmath54 .",
    "both @xmath52 and @xmath54 are fitted to data , while @xmath42 and @xmath43 are fixed according to their experimental numbers in eq .",
    "obtained by the d0 collaboration .",
    "the resulting curves are given by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : full data ] ( the upper panel corresponds to the case with the `` cone cut '' and the bottom one without this cut ) and closely reproduce data .",
    "however , the parameterization of the signal function by an @xmath27- or @xmath4-wave bw can not be really ascertained by the present experimental data @xcite .",
    "this can be easily seen by directly replacing @xmath55 in eq .   by @xmath56 ( with the same mass and width ) and refitting @xmath52 and @xmath54 .",
    "the change for these parameters is small , being around a 5% for the former and a 2% for the latter .",
    "the result of this fit is shown by the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : full data ] , which can hardly be distinguished from the dashed lines corresponding to the @xmath27-wave bw parameterization of the signal function . because of the close proximity between the @xmath27- and @xmath4-wave bw fits and their good reproduction of data , we skip distinguishing between partial and total decay widths of the @xmath1 in eq .  .",
    "notice that for a @xmath10 resonance the @xmath35 channel is also open since @xmath42 is slightly larger ( around 10  mev ) than its threshold .",
    "thus , one can not exclude a @xmath4-wave scenario for the invariant mass distribution of @xmath0 from the decay of the @xmath1 resonance , with the present data determined by the d0 collaboration @xcite . as remarked in ref .",

    "such strategy has also been widely adopted in many instances of coupled - channel studies , see e.g. the recent @xmath129 scattering study in ref .  @xcite . in principle",

    "[ fig:120616.1 ] , it would imply a mass threshold clearly larger than 7000  mev , more than 1200 mev higher than the @xmath37 threshold . however , if the isovector @xmath220 @xmath27-wave potential is multiplied by a factor of 3 we then find a pole at @xmath221 mev with @xmath222  gev",
    ". this pole does not quantitatively agree with the experimental values for the mass and width of the @xmath1 , but our point is to show that more strength in the potential is needed to generate the @xmath1 with natural cutoffs or natural values for the subtraction constants .",
    "we remark here that these exercises are just done for pure academic purposes , and that there is no physical reason to enhance the potential calculated by such factors .",
    "however , it helps us to understand better that if the observed @xmath1 is not found in the scattering amplitude evaluated with a natural cutoff is because the weakness of the leading - order hmchpt transition potentials , agreeing with the inference from burns and swanson @xcite .",
    "these findings point to the direction that is hard to explain theoretically the experimentally reported @xmath1 by the d0 collaboration .",
    "at least it can not be described in a straightforward manner as a dynamically generated resonance by coupled - channel scattering , once the results of the @xmath27-wave study of ref .",
    "@xcite and the current @xmath4-wave attempt are taken simultaneously .    by an obvious replacement of the relevant masses",
    ", one can also explore the charm sector , namely , we have at hand the scattering of @xmath223 , @xmath224 , @xmath225 and @xmath226 , with thresholds 2103.44 , 2247.27 , 2362.6 and 2499.97 mev in order . no resonant pole for a partner state of the @xmath1",

    "the recently observed exotic hadron candidate @xmath1 by the d0 collaboration @xcite in the @xmath0 event distribution with quantum numbers @xmath227 has triggered interesting theoretical and experimental questions . in the present work , we first perform the analysis of the experimental event - distribution data by using a @xmath4-wave breit - wigner parameterization for the resonance signal function , instead of an @xmath27-wave bw as used by the d0 collaboration in its analysis @xcite .",
    "we fix the mass and width of the @xmath4-wave bw to the values obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and the resulting fit reproduces data quite closely , being both fits ( either assuming @xmath27- or @xmath4-wave @xmath0 ) of similar quality .",
    "we then make a complementary analysis by considering the @xmath4-wave coupled - channel scattering between the channels @xmath36 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "notice that then @xmath5 and @xmath6 can couple each other and , indeed , the mass threshold for @xmath6 is much closer to the nominal mass of the @xmath12 than the one for @xmath5 .",
    "this is an interesting point when one is considering the possible `` molecular '' nature for this resonance .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath5 and @xmath6 three - momenta are small ( which presumably makes a @xmath4-wave scattering small ) , but the off - diagonal transitions involving the heavier @xmath37 and @xmath38 states have much larger _",
    "unphysical _ three - momenta , determined by analytical continuation . the transition potential matrix @xmath163 is calculated in leading - order heavy meson chiral perturbation theory and it is then unitarized employing techniques of unitary chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the subtraction constants appearing in the unitarization process are determined with almost coincident values , either by requiring the reproduction of the @xmath175 simple pole in the @xmath9-channel @xmath4-wave scattering or by employing its natural values .",
    "we then search for poles in the resulting @xmath11-matrix and no pole that could be associated to the @xmath1 is found . the same conclusion is obtained when using the unitarity two - point loop functions calculated in terms of a three - momentum cutoff varied within a wide range around 1  gev . if we further release the subtraction constants the @xmath12 pole could be imposed , but the resulting values for the subtraction constants prevent us from consider such a pole as dynamically generated from the @xmath4-wave interactions between the aforementioned two - body channels . in other terms , no explanation for its nature would then be obtained within our approach . replacing the heavy @xmath77-like mesons by the corresponding charm ones , the charm sector can also be explored and similar results arise as well .",
    "we conclude that the main reason for the absence of poles is the weakness of the interactions .    in summary , by combining our @xmath4-wave study in the current work with the recent @xmath27-wave study of ref .",
    "@xcite , the new state @xmath1 observed by d0 the collaboration can not be likely interpreted as a `` molecular '' resonance generated dynamically from two - body coupled - channel scattering .",
    "this point has also been supported by several other groups , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the nature of @xmath1 is still unsettled , and even its existence is inconclusive recalling also the experimental non - observation of this state by lhcb @xcite . more theoretical and experimental efforts are still needed in order to settle these issues .",
