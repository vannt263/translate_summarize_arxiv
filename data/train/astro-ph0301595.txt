    "ultra - high - energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) are puzzling in respect of both their production and their propagation in the universe .",
    "on the one hand , even the most powerful astrophysical sites known to be able to accelerate particles to very high energy seem to have difficulties to reach energies as high as @xmath0  ev ( the highest reported uhecr energy so far@xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "even if they could , one would expect from the ( presumably ) extremely high rigidity of the observed uhecrs in the intergalactic medium that their directions of arrival in the earth atmosphere roughly point towards the sources , which does not seem to be the case .",
    "also , it had been expected that the uhecr flux above @xmath1  ev would be very much reduced due to the interaction of the uhe particles with the cosmological microwave background .",
    "this so - called gzk cutoff@xcite , however , does not seem to be present in the currently available data .",
    "although the uhecr sources are still essentially unknown , many models have been proposed , with various charms and problems @xcite .",
    "they can be divided up into two classes : _ bottom - up _",
    "models , in which particles initially at low ( thermal ) energy get accelerated by one or a series of astrophysical processes , and _ top - down _ models , in which each uhecr is directly produced , _ as a particle _ , at ultra - high energy , through the decay of a pre - existing supermassive particle or some exotic , high - energy physical process , e.g. involving the collapse or annihilation of topological defects . in this paper , we consider the so - called galactic top - down models from a general point of view , merely assuming that the uhecr flux is dominated by sources in the halo , with a density proportional to that of the dark matter .",
    "this solves the ` production problem ' trivially ( or more exactly shifts it to the problem of identifying the x - particles and explaining their production and decay rates ) and provides a simple understanding of the absence of a gzk cutoff as well as the apparent isotropy of the uhecrs  at least until the statistics will be high enough for us to detect the dipole anisotropy due to the off - centered position of the solar system in the galaxy ( which should take at least three years of observation with the pierre auger observatory ( pao )  @xcite ) .",
    "many different models have been proposed , with x - particles of different types ( either produced locally , notably through topological defect interactions , or inherited from the big bang ) and different masses ( on the planck scale , @xmath2  ev , the gut scale , @xmath3  ev , or below )  @xcite . in this paper , we investigate a common consequence of a large class of galactic top - down models , and propose an observational test which could be accessible to the next generation of uhecr detectors , such as the pao  @xcite , the euso experiment  @xcite or the owl / airwatch project  @xcite .",
    "top - down scenarios involve the production of _ hadron jets _ in a way similar to what is observed in terrestrial accelerators , when an energetic quark - antiquark pair ( e.g. produced through e@xmath4e@xmath5 annihilation ) _ hadronizes _ into a number of colourless hadrons through a qcd cascade .",
    "let @xmath6 be the number of photons in a jet ( from neutral pion decay ) , and @xmath7 be the jet opening angle .",
    "since gamma - rays propagate in straight lines away from the source , the average surface density of uhe photons at a distance @xmath8 from the point where the x - particle decayed is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the jet solid angle .",
    "if a detector intersects such a jet , with a surface area @xmath11 orthogonal to the jet axis , it will see on average the following number of particles : @xmath12 if the source is close enough , the number of photons in the jet high enough and the detector surface large enough , then @xmath13 will be larger than one and several uhecrs will be able to cross the detector at ( almost exactly ) the same time , from ( almost exactly ) the same direction .",
    "this is what we define to be a _",
    "multiple event_. it has an unambiguous experimental signature : two or more distinct showers developing simultaneously in the atmosphere , with almost perfectly parallel axes ( within @xmath14 radians , which is much less than any conceivable experimental angular resolution ) .",
    "the number @xmath13 may be called the multiplicity of the x - particle decay event , or more exactly its _ potential multiplicity _ , as can be expected at earth , since it is the average number of particles which can be observed simultaneously by the detector ( assuming that it intersects the jet ) . for a given x - particle decay event , with a given @xmath13 , the _ actual multiplicity _ of the uhecr event as observed by the detector can only be predicted statistically .",
    "the probability , @xmath15 , of observing an event with actual multiplicity @xmath16 ( integer ) in a jet of potential multiplicity @xmath13 ( real number ) is given by the binomial law : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the ratio of the detector s surface to the jet surface ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : multiplicity ] ) ) , and thus the probability for a given particle in the jet to cross the detector .",
    "note that @xmath15 is actually the conditional probability of the multiple event , given the fact that one shower is observed , or if one prefers , the probability that a detected shower be accompanied by @xmath19 others .",
    "the probability of observing a multiple event with whatever multiplicity larger than two simply adds up to @xmath20 , for not too small values of @xmath6 .",
    "the basic idea behind top - down multiple events is thus that the uhecrs are not independent of one another , but appear in close groups released at the same time in a single x - particle decay event .",
    "if the groups are sufficiently tight , we should be able to detect several uhecrs at a time .",
    "in fact , top - down jets can be seen as genuine _",
    "galactic showers _ : in the same way as we detect single uhecr events by intercepting many secondary particles belonging to the same _ atmospheric _ shower , the use of very large detectors may allow us to detect single ` x - particle decay events ' by intercepting several uhecrs belonging to the same _ galactic _ shower .",
    "the detectability of multiple events thus comes down to the question : when we see one uhecr in a top - down jet , how close is the next one , compared to the detector s radius ?",
    "the potential multiplicity , @xmath13 , of a uhecr event ( eq .  [ eq : multiplicity ] ) depends on two physical parameters related to the jet properties , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , one astrophysical parameter , @xmath8 , related to the source distribution , and one ` experimental ' parameter , @xmath11 , related to the detector .",
    "most x - particle decays will occur much too far from the solar system to give rise to multiple events .",
    "but if one assumes that the x - particles distribute over the galactic halo in the same way as the dark - matter , one can estimate the probability that one of the many uhecr events that will be detected over a given period of observation corresponds to a small enough source distance .",
    "for either isothermal or frw models ( see text).,width=340 ]      the statistics of multiple events depend on that of source distances . for the dark - matter distribution in the galaxy , we may consider either a simple isothermal halo model @xcite , where the density , @xmath21 depends on the galactocentric distance , @xmath22 , proportionally to @xmath23 , and the core radius @xmath24 is of the order of a few kiloparsecs , or an frw model based on cold dark matter simulations , with @xmath25 $ ] @xcite . in fig .  [ fig : sourcedensity ] , we have plotted the corresponding effective uhecr source density as a function of distance , for an observer located at the galactocentric radius of the sun ( taking into account the smaller effective contribution of more distant sources ) .    as can be seen , the effective source density is flat for low values of the source distance , which are those of interest to us because they give the highest probability of observing multiple events .",
    "this result is nothing but the famous olber s paradox , and it is independent of the actual dark matter distribution , provided it is not varying significantly on small scales .",
    "moreover , the actual density profile of the dark matter halo appears not to affect significantly the normalization of the source density at small distances ( except for unreasonable values of @xmath24 ) . in the following ,",
    "we adopt the value of @xmath26 ( recalling that nrf models are currently preferred ) and replace , for all practical purposes of the present study , the effective distribution of uhecr source distances by the following differential probability : @xmath27 where @xmath28  kpc is an effective radius beyond which no uhecr sources exist ( that is , they contribute a negligible flux at earth ) .",
    "note that inhomogeneities in the dark matter distribution may in practice alter the probability of x - particle decay events at a given point of the galaxy",
    ". a lower concentration of sources close to the earth would decrease the chance of detecting multiple events , while a higher concentration would increase it .",
    "lacking a precise knowledge of the small scale dark matter distribution , we can but assume that the earth environment is not very different from the average .      for convenience , we shall rewrite the potential multiplicity of an individual uhecr event , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : multiplicity ] ) , as : @xmath29 for any given model , the probability of detecting an event of actual multiplicity larger than @xmath30 increases with the total number of uhecr events detected , @xmath31 , according to the simple law : @xmath32 where the constants @xmath33 are the characteristic numbers of events which have to be detected before it becomes reasonably probable ( @xmath34 ) to detect an event of multiplicity @xmath30 .",
    "this is a straightforward consequence of the statistical independence of x - particle decay events ( see appendix ) .",
    "we show in the appendix that the characteristic event number for double event detection is given by  : @xmath35 and that the subsequent numbers deduce from @xmath36 by the following recursion relation ( valid for detected multiplicities much smaller than the total jet multiplicity , @xmath37 ) : @xmath38 so that , in particular , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , etc .      in order to convert the above characteristic event numbers into multiple event detection timescales ( for a given detector ) , we just need to calculate the uhecr detection rate .",
    "this depends on the total aperture , @xmath42 ( in @xmath43 ) , and the duty cycle , @xmath44 ( in percent ) , of the detector .",
    "the uhecr detection rate above energy @xmath45 is given by : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the integral flux of uhecrs above energy @xmath45 .",
    "from the agasa and fly s eye experiments , a fair value of the uhecr flux at @xmath48  ev is @xmath49 .",
    "the intergal flux obviously depends on the actual spectrum , which is virtually unknown above @xmath48  ev . as for the spectrum below that energy",
    ", one should keep in mind that we are only interested in the events which can be attributed to the top - down process under consideration , and which probably represent only a fraction of the total detected events between @xmath50 and @xmath48  ev .",
    "we shall note @xmath51 the corresponding integrated flux above the detector s threshold energy , @xmath52 .",
    "we can now express the time evolution of the multiple event probabilities , by replacing @xmath31 by @xmath53 in eq .",

    ", we consider here mlla spectra , which are found not to have a simple power - law behavior in the energy range of interest , namely around @xmath48  ev , and to be steeper than often quoted for top - down scenarios  as would result from hill s formula .",
    "it has been argued , however , that the mlla spectra do not reproduce faithfully the fragmentation spectrum in the last energy decade or so , i.e. at energies close to the x - particle mass  @xcite . in this study , we shall only consider x - particle masses above @xmath73  ev , so that the uhecrs of interest have energies well below @xmath74 .",
    "the mlla spectral shape may thus represent a reasonable approximation of the fragmentation spectrum around @xmath48  ev .",
    "the normalization is probably more problematic , however , because it depends largely on the amount of energy carried out by the rarest , most energetic particles in the jet .",

    "if one tries to approximate the spectrum by a power - law @xmath76 ( i.e. @xmath77 , with @xmath78 ) , the logarithmic slope is approximately constant for the hill spectra , while it goes from 1.7 to 2.3 in the energy range of interest , with a value of @xmath79 at @xmath48  ev , for the mlla spectrum . in our ` toy jet model ' , we shall assume a mean hadron spectrum in @xmath80 between @xmath81  ev and @xmath82  ev : @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is a numerical constant , so that @xmath85 .",

    ", we shall adopt for the uhe photons the above @xmath80 spectrum with a value of @xmath90 .",
    "we shall also extrapolate the same spectrum to hadron jets generated by x - particles of lower mass , but with @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 scaled linearly .",
    "this will allow us to explore uhecr progenitors with masses down to @xmath73  ev .",
    "assuming that the x particle decay events lead to the formation of two jets , so that @xmath94 , one finally obtains the following approximate formula ( only valid between @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) : @xmath95      coming now to the question of the jet opening angle , let us first note that a naive line of reasoning based on the lorentz factor collimation effect can not apply here .",
    "one might have been tempted to derive @xmath7 by claiming that an isotropic distribution of the jet particles in the rest frame of the parent quark would translate in the galactic frame into a collimated distribution within a cone of opening angle @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the quark s lorentz factor .",
    "however , such a collimation only applies to the decay products of _ real _ particles , not _ virtual _ ones . in the case",
    "considered here , the parent x - particle _ is _ at rest in the galactic frame , and the jet particles are created out of the extremely intense field represented by a quark / anti - quark pair moving apart , not by the ` decay ' of one of its members . in a qcd jet ,",
    "as it turns out , the hadronization process allows in principle large emission angles , i.e. large values of the particle momentum in a direction perpendicular to the jet axis , @xmath98 .",
    "a standard angular distribution is given by the following logarithmic law : @xmath99 where the regularisation momentum , @xmath100 , is a typical effective qcd scale , of the order of 300  mev .",
    "using this expression , and the fact that the emission angle of a particle is given by @xmath101 , one finds that about 10% of the jet particles are found with @xmath102 , i.e. within @xmath103 , with only a weak dependence on the x - particle mass ( logarithmic in the large quantity @xmath104 ) .",
    "this represents a considerably weaker collimation than what would have been obtained from a lorentz factor argument applied to a progenitor _ real _ quark , giving the opening angle @xmath105 .    in practice",
    ", however , the energy is found to be better collimated than the multiplicity in qcd jets  @xcite , and one expects the highest energy particles ( which we are interested in ) to be much better collimated than obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : logdistrib ] ) .",
    "in other words , the largest perpendicular momenta in the jet distribution are attributed statistically more often to the lower - energy particles . moreover ,",
    "this behaviour is found to be amplified as the jet energy increases .",
    "this is important for our concern , because we are interested only in the particles in the last few decades of the energy range ( above a few @xmath50  ev ) , and not in all the ( much more numerous ) particles between this energy and the gev range , which may fill a cone with a larger opening angle , but which shall not be detected as uhecrs anyway .    extrapolating the semi - empirical theory available at cern energies towards the ultra - high energies of interest",
    ", one finds that for a quark jet , about 50% of the jet energy is found within @xmath106 radians of the jet axis ( dokshitzer , private communication ) . considering this number as well as",
    "that obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : logdistrib ] ) , we shall arbitrarily adopt the following , hopefully conservative value for the uhecr jet opening angle : @xmath107    the above estimates are admittedly arguable , and can not be expected to hold for all models , but they may represent a reasonable description of the jets in the energy range of interest . any other assumptions about @xmath108 and @xmath7 ( e.g. motivated by a detailed study of a particular top - down model )",
    "can be used in the following , in a straightforward replacement of ours .",
    "let us now evaluate the characteristic timescale of double event observation , @xmath66 , by replacing the various model parameters by their numerical values in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau2compactbis ] ) .",
    "the flux of top - down uhecrs above the detector s threshold energy , @xmath51 , is obtained consistently with the assumed hadronization spectrum : we normalize the @xmath80 spectrum to the quoted value of @xmath109 at @xmath48  ev , i.e. we assume that all the uhecrs at @xmath48  ev have a top - down origin ( and only a fraction of them below that energy ) .",
    "one thus obtains : @xmath110 from which it follows : @xmath111 in the case of the next generation uhecr observatories , the detection surface on the ground will be @xmath112 for the pao",
    "( one site ) , and @xmath113 for euso .",
    "the detector s duty cycles are respectively 100% and 14% , and the energy thresholds are @xmath50  ev for the pao and @xmath114  ev for euso . with these number ,",
    "one finds , for an x - particle at the gut scale ( @xmath115 ) : @xmath116 which are smaller than the observatories lifetimes ( 15 and 3 years , respectively ) .",
    "the timescales for triple , quadruple and quintuple event detections are respectively 2 times , 2.67 and 3.2 times larger , as follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau2compact ] ) .",
    "as indicated above , these timescales scale with the x - particle mass as @xmath117 , and with the actual number of uhe photons within the jets as @xmath118 .",
    "even a drastic decrease in the photon multiplicity in the jet by an order of magnitude would only increase the lifetimes by a factor @xmath119 and keep the double event detection timescales smaller than the lifetime of each experiments .",
    "the sensitivity to @xmath7 is linear , however , and jet models with much larger opening angles than assumed here would make double event detection more problematic .",
    "we should also note that decay modes into more than two jets would lead to smaller photon multiplicities , so that @xmath66 would also scale as @xmath120 .",
    "considering the above uncertainties , we shall now derive a model - independent limit for the detection of double events , based on the fact that every uhe photon in a top - down model comes from the decay of a neutral pion , and is therefore accompanied by a second photon within a very small angle , due to relativistic beaming . for a photon pair at @xmath48  ev , say , the parent pion lorentz factor is @xmath121 , so that the opening angle of this minimal , two - particle jet is @xmath122 . using the source distance distribution , eq .",
    "( [ eq : p(d ) ] ) , and averaging over the decay angle in the pion rest frame , one finds the probability distribution of the distance @xmath123 between the two photons of a pair corresponding to a random uhecr event : @xmath124 this allows us to estimate the probability that a detected uhe photon be accompanied by a second one within the range of the detector ( of radius @xmath125 ) : @xmath126 from this , one can derive the minimum characteristic timescale for double event detection ( independent of both @xmath7 and @xmath6 ) : @xmath127 while this timescale may seem prohibitively long ( 17 years for the euso detector , of radius @xmath128  km ) , one should note the cubic dependence in @xmath125 : a detector only two times larger ( i.e. on an orbit two times higher ) would detect double events from the _ minimal _ top - down jets on a timescale slightly above 2 years .",
    "this model - independent upper limit may give confidence that multiple event detection should indeed be possible , if the uhecrs are produced in galactic top - down jets containing not just two photons from an isolated @xmath87 decay , but thousands of uhe photons .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the possibility of observing multiple uhecr events from galactic hadron jets , resulting from the decay of supermassive x - particles in the halo .",
    "we have shown that , under reasonable assumptions about the jet properties , the next generation uhecr detectors should be able to detect a few double events , and possibly one or two triple and quadruple events , provided the uhe flux is dominated by top - down sources at about @xmath48  ev , and the mass of the x - particle progenitor is around the gut scale .",
    "the main uncertainties in our calculations come from the jet model .",
    "our assumptions about the photon spectrum , the jet multiplicity and the jet opening angle can only be considered as rough estimates , and other x - particle model may lead to different values . nevertheless , we have derived a general framework for the study of multiple events probability , and given a way to calculate the relevant detection timescales for any x - particle model , once its physical parameters are specified . in particular , we have shown that the timescale @xmath66 is proportional to the jet opening angle , and inversely proportional to the square root of the photon multiplicity in the jets .    considering the jet uncertainties ,",
    "we have also derived the double event detection timescale for the worst possible case : a two - particle jet consisting of the two photons produced by the decay of a neutral pion , as must be found in any galactic hadron jet , whatever the model considered .",
    "this gives an upper limit on @xmath66 which would reduce to @xmath79  years for a detector twice as large as euso .",
    "note that this is also independent of the x - particle mass , contrary to the timescales obtained by taking into account all the particles inside the jet .",
    "note also that we have assumed homogeneously distributed photons inside the jets . in the case of a clumpy distribution",
    ", the probability of observing a multiple event can only be higher than what we have obtained here , because the photon density close to an arbitrary photon would then be higher ( on average ) than the mean photon density in the jet .",
    "besides this new test of galactic top - down models , three other observational signatures have already been proposed .",
    "first , top - down scenarios predict that photons should be the dominant component among uhecrs above @xmath48  ev .",
    "as we have seen , this is very important for our study , because charged particles of even ultra - high rigidity would be slightly deflected in the galactic magnetic fields and lose the almost perfect collimation which multiple event require .",
    "second , the dipole anisotropy due to the off - centered position of the earth should eventually show up in the data , although this indirect evidence might not be fully discriminatory , since at least one bottom - up model has been proposed with the same characteristics @xcite .",
    "finally , the uhecr energy spectrum should be characteristic of a hadronic fragmentation process , which may be quite different from the power laws usually expected from astrophysical acceleration processes .",
    "however , the exact shape of the spectrum is still hard to predict precisely in any of the top - down or bottom - up models , and it is not clear whether a measurement with reasonable error bars over two decades in energy at most ( @xmath50 to @xmath129  ev , say ) can lead to definitive conclusions .",
    "by contrast , the detection of ( were it only ) one multiple event would provide a clear , direct evidence that a top - down scenario is involved , because it is highly improbable that two independent , bottom - up uhecrs arrive exactly at the same time from exactly the same direction . in this respect , we should recall that a previous study excluded ( or more precisely found very improbable ) the possibility that a heavy nucleus be photodisintegrated by the solar radiation field and give rise to a pair of showers from the lighter , daughter nuclei @xcite ( besides , such a pair would be perfectly correlated with the sun s position ) .",
    "as shown above , the ideal detector to implement such a test and detect multiple events from galactic - size hadron jets is a detector of very large acceptance , but not necessarily good angular and energy resolutions , which is usually one of the main challenges for uhecr detectors .",
    "one might therefore think about the interest of devising a detector made of a series of atmospheric fluorescence telescopes covering a huge surface on earth , but with poor angular and energy resolutions in order to keep it economical .",
    "finally , we note that while the jet parameters are a major cause of uncertainty in the calculation of multiple events detection timescales , this very fact may offer a possibility to constrain them ( if the top - down origin of uhecrs were to be attested by this or another way ) .",
    "this may represent a unique opportunity to study the hadronization processes at energies many orders of magnitude above what can be reached in terrestrial accelerators .",
