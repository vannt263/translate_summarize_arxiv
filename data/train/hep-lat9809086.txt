    "many improved actions have been proposed and studied which may allow us much more reliable simulations near the continuum limit within the limited computer resources existing nowadays .",
    "one way to obtain such improved actions is to find the renormalized trajectory ( rt ) , any point on which serves as a `` perfect action '' @xcite . here",
    "we will consider the simplest case , i.e. , actions in two coupling @xmath0 space , which for practical purposes are preferable than actions with a larger number of operators . in this contribution , we evaluate the rg flow and study whether the performance of such actions improves when they approach the renormalized trajectory .",
    "we adapt swendsen s blocking transformation scheme @xcite , which is defined as @xmath2    under this transformation the lattice spacing is doubled . repeating this blocking transformation",
    ", we can get an action near the rt .    after each transformation",
    "we generate a blocked configuration , the couplings on which can be determined via the schwinger - dyson equation : where @xmath3 are the `` staples '' corresponding to the link @xmath4 . solving these equations",
    ", we can calculate the coefficients of operators corresponding to the blocked action . in this paper",
    "we will neglect truncation errors and assume that the resulting blocked actions also have only two couplings , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "figure  [ fig.flow ] shows the blocking transformation flow in two - coupling space .",
    "the rt can be calculated within the strong coupling expansion .",
    "the string tension is obtained from the expectation value of wilson loops . to leading order ,",
    "@xmath7 imposing that in the strong coupling limit , the lattice spacing goes to infinity , one easily derives the following relation @xmath8 as this equation tells us , in this limit , the rt is a parabola which is presented in figure  [ fig.flow ] to compare with the rt obtained by solving the s - d equations as indicated above .",
    "one could as well solve the s - d equations with coefficients calculated by the strong coupling expansion .",
    "this is work in progress and the results will be reported elsewhere .",
    "here we report on the scaling analysis of several improved actions .",
    "we study the violation of rotational symmetry as well as @xmath9 .",
    "first we define the following quantity which represents the violation of rotational symmetry @xmath10 ^ 2 } { v(r)^2\\delta v(r)^2}\\left(\\sum_{\\mbox{off}}\\frac{1}{\\delta v(r)^2 } \\right)^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the static quark potential and @xmath12 its error .",
    "@xmath13 is a fitting function from only on - axis data , and @xmath14 implies summation over only off - axis data .",
    "we calculate this quantity with various improved actions .",
    "we write @xmath15 , and impose the condition , @xmath16 .",
    "the wilson action corresponds @xmath17 . for symanzik(tree ) , iwasaki and dbw2 actions , @xmath18 , respectively @xcite .",
    "dbw2 ( double blocked from wilson action in 2 coupling space ) is defined in ref .",
    "results are summarized in figure  [ fig.dv ] .",
    "simulations have been performed on a lattice of size @xmath19 .",
    "thermalization is 5000 sweeps , while the interval between wilson loop measurements is 500 sweeps .",
    "we used 100 configurations .      here",
    "we study the scaling behavior of @xmath9 for dbw2 .",
    "the critical temperature is defined by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the temporal extension of the lattice , and @xmath22 is the lattice spacing at critical coupling @xmath23 . in order to extract @xmath23",
    ", we calculate the polyakov loop susceptibility on @xmath24 lattices .",
    "then @xmath25 in the infinite volume limit are obtained by using finite size scaling ( of @xmath26 ) .",
