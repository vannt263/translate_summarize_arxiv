    "the hubbard model is known for its universality .",
    "the model and its extensions have been used in research of magnetism , superconductivity and especially high temperature superconductivity ( hts ) , other various phases in the solid , charge orderings , phase separation etc .",
    ", in materials like high temperature superconductors , bismuthates , chevrel phases , amorphous semiconductors , heavy fermion materials , systems with alternating valence to name the few ( for a review see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) . despite intensive research the results concerning the model come mostly from different approximations or numerical simulations .",
    "the exact results are scarce and concern mostly specific situation of one dimension ( 1d ) or specific band fillings or specific limits : zero bandwidth , infinite @xmath3 or infinite @xmath4 .",
    "we can mention the exact solution in 1d obtained by bethe ansatz@xcite , nagaoka ferromagnetism in repulsive , half - filled systems with one hole@xcite , flat band ferromagnetism@xcite , lieb s ferrimagnetism@xcite , some bounds on correlation functions@xcite and a statement of necessity of bound states for existence of extended s - wave superconductivity in 2d systems with low electron density @xmath5 , by randeria@xcite .",
    "let s also note that the mean - field bcs equations for superconductivity in the hubbard model with effective attractive interaction between electrons , in the limit of vanishing electron density turn into schrodinger equations , which can also be solved exactly@xcite .",
    "an interesting , unresolved question concerning hubbard model is : what happens , when we increase the strength of the interaction ?",
    "what phases do we obtain ? or does the system prefer phase separation ? that was the conclusion of the paper by robaszkiewicz and pawlowski@xcite .",
    "by the broken symmetry hartree - fock approach they established that the attractive extended hubbard model ( with nearest neighbor  nn  density - density interactions of strength @xmath6 added ) in two dimensions for arbitrary electron density and moderate values of @xmath7 is superconducting in the ground state but becomes phase separated with increasing @xmath7 ( except from @xmath8 , where the ground state is in charge density wave phase for any @xmath9 ) . in the case of @xmath10 they obtained the phase of electron droplets and for @xmath1 a phase separation between charge density waves ( cdw ) with @xmath8 and a singlet on - site superconductivity ( ss ) ( extended s - wave was not considered ) .",
    "the free energy of this phase separated state ( ps[cdw / ss ] ) turned out to be lower than the energy of the homogenous mixed state ( m(cdw+ss ) ) .",
    "stabilization of m state required longer than nn repulsive intersite interactions ( @xmath11 ) or increasing @xmath12 . for @xmath13 ps and m states",
    "were degenerated even for @xmath14 .    in this paper",
    "it will be shown that including @xmath2-pairing ( superconducting pairing with singlet pairs with center - of - mass momentum @xmath15)@xcite into the hamiltonian stabilizes mixed phase , already with intersite interactions @xmath6 restricted to the nn ( in disagreement with ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it turns out that the phase separation ps[cdw / ss ] exists only below certain critical value of @xmath6 , above which the m phase can be stabilized .",
    "it can be shown , that in the low density limit the bcs equations go over to the schrodinger equation for the bound pair@xcite . in the center - of mass coordinate system",
    "the wave function of the two particle bound state can be expanded as the sum of states with the definite relative momenta . using that expansion",
    "we can obtain a set of self - consistent equations for the pair wave function in a position space , in terms of lattice green functions@xcite .",
    "for the hypercubic lattices these equations were solved ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and it has been found out that in one and two dimensions pairs for @xmath16 bind for any negative @xmath3 , while in three dimensions there is critical value for @xmath6 . in the cited reference",
    "the formula was given for the @xmath17 as a function of @xmath3 : @xmath18^{-1}+(c-1)^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the watson integral .",
    "in ref.@xcite this formula was given only for the case of @xmath10 but in fact it is valid for any @xmath3 and @xmath6 .",
    "what s more , there exists analogic formula , applicable not only in the low density limit but for any electron density .",
    "it was derived from the hamiltonian after hartree - fock linearization so it is not exact , but goes over into the exact eq .",
    "( [ wcrex ] ) for @xmath20 .",
    "the formula is given by : @xmath21 or for the rectangular dos@xcite : @xmath22 .",
    "the energy of a phase separated state , @xmath23 , is calculated according to the formula : @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the values of @xmath26 of the two separating phases at the @xmath27 corresponding to the lowest energy homogenous solution for a given phase . @xmath28 and @xmath29 are fractions of the system occupied by the phases @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "there is also a similar equation connecting charge densities in the two coexisting phases : @xmath32 a very useful is also maxwell construction : @xmath33 which is equivalent to the condition of minimization of @xmath23 respectively @xmath34 with fixed @xmath35 and @xmath5 .",
    "taking into account eqs  ( [ maxfrac ] ) and ( [ max ] ) , eq .  ( [ eps ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath36    there is also another , equivalent but more intuitive approach using gibbs energies @xmath37 .",
    "the independent variable for @xmath38 is chemical potential @xmath39 instead of charge density @xmath5 for @xmath40 .",
    "let s note , that instead of the analogue of eq .",
    "( [ maxfrac ] ) , with @xmath41 instead of @xmath42 , we have @xmath43 , because this is the condition of equilibrium , or rather the definition of equilibrium !",
    "( [ maxfrac ] ) does not apply also because @xmath39 is not an extensive quantity ) .",
    "there is only one value of chemical potential , fixed and the same for both phases . this way",
    "the whole construction simplifies .",
    "the procedure is as follows : we find solutions for the homogenous phases , then we plot their gibbs energies vs @xmath39 in one figure and we look for the intersections of @xmath38 s belonging to the different phases .",
    "such intersection means a coexistence of the two phases with the same @xmath39 , i.e. , in equilibrium .",
    "the same value of @xmath39 usually translates into _ different _ values of @xmath44 and @xmath34 in the two phases under consideration and that s nothing else but the ( definition of ) phase separation , which appears on the @xmath40-@xmath5 phase diagram for the electron density @xmath5 , constructed according to the eq .",
    "( [ maxfrac ] ) .",
    "some remarks are due :     : :    let s note that the use of @xmath38 and chemical potential    makes it clear that @xmath44 and @xmath34 are    independent of @xmath5 , as there is usually one intersection    point of gibbs energies . in other words , @xmath28 is a linear    function of @xmath5 : @xmath45  : :    let s note that eq .",
    "( [ eps ] ) gives boundaries for @xmath23 .    by the definition in eq .",
    "( [ eps ] ) , @xmath23 must be    somewhere between @xmath46 and    @xmath47 . by the same reasoning that led us to the    eq .  ( [ mfunc ] )",
    "we can say that the dependence of phase separated states    on @xmath5 should be strictly linear , with the same    coefficients as in the eq .",
    "( [ mfunc ] ) . that s nothing else but the    maxwell condition restated  : :    the same considerations as above apply to the electron density : phase    separated state can exist only for charge densities    @xmath48 .",
    "this is an important bound , which can be    easily overlooked , as there are formal solutions for free energy of    phase separated state also outside that range  : :    a simple implication of the preceding points , which we will call    _ theorem 1 _ : we can not obtain a phase transition by changing    @xmath5 between two phase separated states having `` a state in    common '' for the same fixed density @xmath44 , i.e. we can    not have phase transition between states like ps1[cdw(n=1)/phase1 ] and    ps2[cdw(n=1)/phase2 ] .",
    "the lines depicting @xmath49 and    @xmath50 will begin in the same point and will extend in    different directions .  : :    and last but not the least is the notion , that we have also bounds for    homogenous phases : the phases can exist only for the positive    compressibility , i.e. in the range of @xmath39 , for which    @xmath51",
