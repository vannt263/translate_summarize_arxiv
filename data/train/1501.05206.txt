    "sir isaac newton reportedly said that he could calculate the motion of heavenly bodies but not the madness of people , when he had lost a fortune in the south sea bubble .",
    "since his time , there have been vigorous attempts to apply the so - called newtonian approach to our society in order to understand the ` madness of people ' .",
    "it is interesting that some of modern economists have finally explained bubbles as based on rational expectation  @xcite , although it does not mean that bubbles are really under our control . at the same time",
    ", they distinguish a fad from a bubble as the former originates solely from social forces , which are harder to rationalize from an economic point of view .",
    "even if we take a more phenomenological viewpoint , how this social influence organizes itself seems to remain largely unpredictable .",
    "a society adopts some practices and abandons some others constantly , but it is neither a matter of practical use nor that of aesthetic superiority .",
    "one might say that it is because something is ` cool ' , but it hardly explains anything but the unpredictability .",
    "it is another , perhaps a worse kind of ` madness ' from a physicist s point of view .",
    "given names are subject to fads  @xcite .",
    "it is sharply contrasted to the case of family names , whose dynamics is well defined by mathematical models  @xcite .",
    "if a certain given name prevails , on the other hand , it is simply because it sounds cool , i.e. , for no particular reason .",
    "note that being a fad in this context does not necessarily mean that it is short - lived : for example , michael was the most popular name in the united states for about half a century from the 1950s  @xcite .",
    "our point is that such popularity is not explained by any of its intrinsic properties , and we will call it a fad regardless of the time scale . even if it is difficult to predict a fad , e.g. , what will be the most popular name for babies next year",
    ", one may still expect a higher degree of regularity in the rise and fall of each given name .",
    "fortunately , there is an available data set , compiled by duchesne , which has recorded frequencies of @xmath0 major given names in the canadian province of quebec for more than a century  @xcite .",
    "it is basically a collection of names given to a certain number of people each year , from which the fractions of the given names are calculated .",
    "this collection is also called a corpus and its size , i.e. , the number of people surveyed , has been greater than @xmath1 every year throughout the 20th century . in fig .  [",
    "fig : wave ] , the shade represents the fraction , and the names are sorted according to the mean time of prevalence , defined as @xmath2 where @xmath3 runs from year 1900 to 2000 , and @xmath4 is the fraction of a particular name in year @xmath3 .",
    "this plot suggests the existence of a certain regular pattern .",
    "that is , fads propagate with forming a traveling wave across the space of names , from one name to another , and it is more clearly seen for female names .",
    "in addition , the narrower width of the name distribution along the vertical axis in fig .  [ fig : wave](b ) indicates that the change is more rapid for girls names .",
    "this observation implies that the female - name dynamics is probably simpler , in the sense that one only has to be concerned about how his or her daughter s name will sound to others .",
    "based on this observation , we will construct a descriptive model for the pattern in the female names . while the existing models in refs .",
    "consider the dynamics of a single name interacting with the environment , we are more interested in describing the competition among many names that takes place simultaneously .",
    "this many - body problem reduces to a reaction - diffusion system written in terms of the frequency distribution of newborn children s given names , yielding a traveling - wave solution . by comparing the model with the empirical data",
    ", we will check whether our picture captures essential parts of the dynamics .     to @xmath5 .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    this work is organized as follows .",
    "the next section presents our model , formulated as a generalized version of the fisher equation  @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : data ] then explains how we analyze the empirical data and compare them with our model . in this section",
    ", the goodness of fit will be quantitatively estimated with a statistical test .",
    "after discussing the result in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we conclude this work .",
    "our starting point is adoption - exploration dynamics of idea spreading  @xcite . according to this theory",
    ", we may imagine that each given name behaves as a biological species , competing to win as many adopters as possible .",
    "in other words , given names are assumed to obey certain evolutionary dynamics . to formulate this dynamics in mathematical terms",
    ", we need a number ( or a set of numbers ) to quantify the competitiveness of each name relative to that of others . just as a species",
    "is said to have its own fitness  @xcite , therefore , let us furthermore assume that it is possible to assign a certain value of ` fitness ' , represented by a real number @xmath6 , to each given name .",
    "our viewpoint is that the names are arranged and indexed by this fitness measure , and a name with @xmath6 is picked up by a newborn baby s parents from a certain probability distribution function .",
    "note that our formulation mainly concerns how likely a name will be chosen for a newborn baby , rather than the fraction of all the people carrying that name .",
    "it is also important to remember that each given name has a fixed value of @xmath6 , which is independent of time @xmath3 , so that we can effectively map each @xmath6 to a different name .",
    "for this reason , one can think of @xmath6 as a position in the space of names , analogous to the horizontal axis in fig .  [",
    "fig : wave ] , although we do not actually have to determine the values for the data set in our analysis as will be seen below .",
    "so it is the _ fraction _ of @xmath6 , instead of its value , that changes with time . due to the growth of the fitter",
    ", the distribution will move to higher values of @xmath6 in general . as a result , a time series for a specific given name can be unimodal at best .",
    "this might not be strictly true in western countries  @xcite .",
    "but in quebec , only a few percent of names succeed to come back . in our data",
    "set , therefore , such recurrence as considered in ref .",
    "can rather be treated as exceptional .",
    "let us consider the following adoption - exploration dynamics  @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the probability density function at time @xmath3 for finding a ` species ' of fitness @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the payoff that the species gains , and @xmath11 is the population average of @xmath12 defined as @xmath13 .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side ( rhs ) means that @xmath14 has a relative growth rate proportional to @xmath12 , in a similar spirit to the replicator equation in evolutionary biology  @xcite .",
    "one may also refer to ref .   for mathematical aspects of a replicator equation on a continuous trait space .",
    "the second term on the rhs describes exploratory activities for new traits as diffusion along the @xmath6 axis .",
    "the positive parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 are thus called the rate of adoption and a measure of exploration , respectively .",
    "it is instructive to compare this with eigen s phenomenological theory of selection  @xcite . from our perspective , it is important that this theory of selection can generally be applied to any information carriers that reproduce themselves , including memes .",
    "the theory starts with the following rate equation for @xmath17 , the concentration of an information carrier @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) : @xmath20 where the first and second terms refer to self - instructed reproduction and removal of the carrier , respectively , whereas the last summation contains all the other production such as mutation .",
    "as one of possible conditions for selection , we may choose @xmath21 .",
    "the reproduction and removal can be specified further as follows : let us set @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a rate constant , @xmath24 is an amplification factor , and @xmath25 is a quality factor of precise reproduction .",
    "likewise , we set @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a decomposition factor and @xmath28 is a dilution factor , which is controlled by the boundary condition and assumed to be independent of @xmath18 .",
    "we now obtain a more detailed form of the rate equation : @xmath29 if we sum up both sides of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eigen ] ) over @xmath18 , we find that @xmath30 because @xmath31 identically vanishes .",
    "if we define a selective value as @xmath32 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : sumup ] ) means that @xmath33 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : eigen ] ) is thus rewritten as @xmath34 supposing that the mutation rates @xmath35 are symmetric , homogeneous , and short - ranged in the index space , one can approximate the last term by a second - order differential and derive eq .",
    "( [ eq : rd ] ) through a suitable limiting process  @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested in ref .   that @xmath12 can be identified with the cumulative distribution @xmath36 up to a proportionality coefficient absorbed into @xmath15 , because those with @xmath37 are potential adopters of @xmath6 . in the general context of fads",
    ", however , the payoff function might not be such a simple linear function of @xmath38 .",
    "for example , there can be an adverse effect of being too popular .",
    "let us generalize the above argument in the following way : we assume that there eventually develops a traveling wave with speed @xmath39 and a unimodal shape of @xmath40 . at any time , the corresponding @xmath41 should be a monotonically increasing smooth function of @xmath6 within a certain region .",
    "our claim is that it can then be used as a basis for expressing an arbitrary shape of @xmath42 within the region of our interest .",
    "the idea is as follows : if we define @xmath43 , there is one - to - one correspondence between @xmath6 and @xmath44 as long as @xmath45 , and one can write @xmath46 as a function of @xmath44 instead of @xmath6 . we expand @xmath47 as a polynomial in @xmath44 , i.e. , @xmath48 with coefficients @xmath49 .",
    "clearly , @xmath50 does not alter the dynamics as @xmath11 is subtracted , and @xmath51 is absorbed into the equation by rescaling the time scale .",
    "we will therefore retain the two lowest - order contributions as @xmath52 with a constant @xmath53 , where the factor of @xmath54 is added for later convenience .",
    "this constant @xmath53 is introduced as a shape parameter to control the skewness of the distribution , but it can also be interpreted as the population s preference to new fads . if @xmath53 is negative , for example , it means that the population is ` conservative ' in the sense that the fitness @xmath46 does not increase with @xmath6 as sharply as it would under positive @xmath53 . noting that @xmath55 we rewrite eq .",

    ", we will consider the following equation : @xmath66 this form is close to the zeldovich equation  @xcite , although the phase - space structure is different as will be detailed below . if @xmath67 , this is mathematically equivalent to the celebrated fisher equation  @xcite .",
    "this model can also be interpreted in terms of the activator - inhibitor model in ref .",
    "( see appendix  [ sec : aim ] for details ) .",
    "in addition , one may recall that a spin system is phenomenologically expressed by the time - dependent ginzburg - landau equation as @xmath68 where @xmath69 denotes the order parameter  @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : gov ] ) can be interpreted as introducing a cubic term to the rhs , although we are not dealing with a magnetic system .",
    "the assumption of the traveling wave implies that @xmath70 , where @xmath39 is the speed . in a moving frame with coordinate @xmath71 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gov ] ) describes the shape of the wave as a second - order ordinary differential equation : @xmath72 or , equivalently , a set of two first - order ordinary differential equations : @xmath73 where the first line relates the probability density function @xmath74 and its cumulative @xmath75 .",

    "this proves the existence of the minimum speed @xmath85 below which one can not find a traveling - wave solution ( see appendix  [ sec : speed ] for more discussion and references on the speed selection principle ) . if @xmath86 , the wave can stop , meaning that the population is so conservative that there might be no progression to higher @xmath6 . the last fixed point at @xmath87",

    "we see from this figure that many of the parameter values do overlap as predicted by our theory .",
    "it is also interesting that the estimated speed is not far from @xmath140 , if we consider that a new fad would start with a sharp initial condition .",
    "figure  [ fig : chi2](c ) shows the estimated parameters of the names inside the cluster , against their @xmath141 [ eq .  ( [ eq : meant ] ) ] .",
    "it confirms that the parameters have been stationary throughout the period of observation , which is one of our underlying assumptions .",
    "we also have a few outliers that accept fairly large @xmath39 or @xmath53 .",
    "let us take a closer look by plotting the data for two of them , genevive and brigitte [ fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2](d ) ] .",
    "then , we immediately find that the large @xmath39 of the former name is likely to be an artifact due to the steady noise level , because a broader distribution may be interpreted as faster propagation ( see appendix  [ sec : speed ] ) .",
    "the same explanation applies to all the other names with large error bars in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2](b ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the latter case of brigitte shows exceptionally large skewness in spite of rather stable parameter estimations [ fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2](b ) ] .",
    "such a distorted shape is probably caused by external factors that our model can not account for .",
    "overall , we conclude that our model does explain a part of the observed data , because it describes about 40 names with consistent values of @xmath39 and @xmath53 . at the same time",
    ", the degree of heterogeneity among the given names has turned out to be higher than we expected from fig .",
    "[ fig : wave ] .",
    "in summary , we have constructed a model to describe a pattern of fads .",
    "our working hypothesis has been that although each fad is unpredictable , the overall pattern tends to repeat itself over and over again .",
    "figure  [ fig : wave ] provides a striking indication of this hypothesis , and suggests that the governing dynamics can develop a traveling - wave solution with a well - defined shape .",
    "we have built up a mean - field theory of selection and mutation to explain the observation in fig .",
    "[ fig : wave ] .",
    "the assumption of a traveling - wave solution implies that the time series of every name can be fitted to a single curve if translated horizontally .",
    "we have introduced a shape parameter @xmath53 in addition to the wave speed @xmath39 , and checked whether these parameters give consistent estimates over the hundred time series .",
    "our model must have oversimplified the reality as we all know that the naming dynamics is involved with many accidental factors such as celebrities and mass media .",
    "so as long as the theory predicts sensible behavior , the question should be how much these random fluctuations alter the dynamics .",
    "our analysis suggests the existence of the regularity on a qualitative level : most of the names are described by unimodal left - skewed distribution , which means that it is common to adopt a fad rapidly and then abandon it slowly .",
    "quantitatively , we have found meaningful fitting results for about @xmath142 names among @xmath0 .",
    "since we have missed more than a half , we also conclude that the heterogeneity is not so negligible as assumed in the theory",
