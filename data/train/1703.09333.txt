    "transverse single - spin asymmetry ( tssa ) phenomena have gained substantial attention in both experimental and theoretical studies in recent years .",
    "the existence of tssas has been well established in the production of light mesons at forward rapidity in transversely polarized @xmath2@xmath8@xmath2 collisions at energies ranging from the zero gradient synchrotron up to the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) . surprisingly large but",
    "oppositely - signed tssa results were first observed in @xmath9 and @xmath10 production at large feynman-@xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) in transversely polarized collisions at @xmath13 gev  @xcite .",
    "these results surprised the quantum - chromodynamics ( qcd ) community because they disagreed with the expectation from the naive perturbative qcd of very small spin asymmetries  @xcite .",
    "the large tssa of pion production has been subsequently observed in hadronic collisions over a range of energies extending up to @xmath14 500 gev for @xmath15 ( @xmath14 200 gev for @xmath16 )  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , tssa in @xmath17 meson production has also been studied at forward rapidity  @xcite .",
    "the results are consistent with the observed @xmath15 asymmetries at various energies in the overlapping @xmath12 regions .",
    "two theoretical formalisms within the perturbative qcd framework have been proposed to explain the origin of these large tssas at forward rapidity .",
    "both formalisms connect the tssa to the transverse motion of the partons inside the transversely - polarized nucleon and/or to spin - dependent quark fragmentation .",
    "one framework is based on the transverse - momentum - dependent ( tmd ) parton distribution and fragmentation functions , called tmd factorization .",
    "the initial state contributions are originating from the sivers function  @xcite , which describes the correlation between the transverse spin of the nucleon and the parton transverse momentum in the initial state .",
    "the final state contribution originates from the quark transversity distribution and the collins @xcite fragmentation function , which describes the fragmentation of a transversely polarized quark into a final state hadron with nonzero transverse momentum relative to the parton direction .",
    "this framework requires two observed scales where only one needs to be hard and both effects have been observed in sidis measurements  @xcite .",
    "however , tmd factorization can not be used in the interpretation of hadron production in @xmath2@xmath8@xmath2 collisions as only one hard scale is available @xcite .",
    "a second framework , applicable to our study , follows the qcd collinear factorization approach .",
    "the collinear , higher - twist effects become more important in generating a large tssa when there is only one observed momentum scale that is much larger than the nonperturbative hadronic scale @xmath18 mev  @xcite .",
    "a large tssa can be generated from the twist-3 , transverse - spin - dependent , multi - parton correlation functions in the initial state or fragmentation functions in the final state .    at rhic energies ,",
    "gluon - gluon interaction processes dominate heavy quark production  @xcite , so heavy quarks serve to isolate the gluon contribution to the asymmetries .",
    "phenix has measured the tssa ( @xmath19 ) of @xmath20 in central and forward rapidity  @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions of the @xmath20 single - spin asymmetry are complicated by the lack of good understanding of @xmath20 production mechanism  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are feed - down contributions from higher resonance states in inclusive @xmath20 production  @xcite . on the other hand , the effect of pure gluonic correlation functions on @xmath21-meson production in transversely",
    "polarized collisions has been extensively studied within the twist-3 mechanism in the framework of collinear factorization  @xcite .",
    "however , it is difficult to constrain the trigluon correlation functions due to the lack of experimental results .",
    "future measurements including @xmath21-meson production are proposed at the large hadron collider  @xcite .",
    "this paper reports on measurements of the cross section and tssa for muons from open heavy - flavor decays in polarized collisions at @xmath22 .",
    "results are presented for muons from semi - leptonic decays of open heavy - flavor hadrons , mainly @xmath23 and @xmath24 , in the forward and backward rapidity regions ( @xmath4 ) ; the accessible momentum fraction of gluons in the proton is 0.01250.0135 and 0.080.14 in the backward ( @xmath25 ) and forward ( @xmath26 ) regions with respect to the polarized beam direction , respectively .",
    "[ sec : phenix ] describes the rhic polarized proton beams and the phenix experimental setup .",
    "the detailed analysis of muons from open heavy - flavor , including cross sections and tssas , will be described in sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] and the results will be presented in sec .  [",
    "sec : results ] .",
    "finally , a discussion of the results and their possible implications will be provided in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "side view of the phenix detector in the 2012 run ]    the phenix detector comprises two central arms at midrapidity and two muon arms at forward and backward rapidity  @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phenix ] , two muon spectrometers cover the full azimuthal angle in the pseudorapidity range @xmath27 ( north arm ) and @xmath28 ( south arm ) . in front of each muon arm , there is about 7 interaction lengths ( @xmath29 ) of copper - and - iron absorber which provides a rejection factor of 1000 for charged pions , and an additional stainless - steel absorber ( 2 @xmath29 in total ) installed in 2011 contributes to further suppress hadronic background  @xcite .",
    "each muon arm has three stations of cathode strip chambers , muon tracker ( mutr ) , for momentum measurement and five layers ( labeled from gap0 to gap4 ) of proportional tube planes , muon identifier ( muid ) , for muon identification .",
    "each muid gap comprises a plane of absorber ( @xmath30 ) and two planes of iarrocci tubes whose orientation is along either the horizontal or the vertical direction in each plane .",
    "the muid also provides a trigger for events containing one or more muon candidates .    the minimum bias ( mb ) trigger is provided by the beam - beam counters ( bbc )  @xcite , which comprise two arrays of 64 quartz erenkov detectors to detect charged particles at high pseudorapidity .",
    "each detector is located at @xmath31 from the interaction point , and covers the pseudorapidity range @xmath32 .",
    "the bbc also determines the collision - vertex position ( @xmath33 ) along the beam axis , with a resolution of roughly 2  cm in collisions .",
    "rhic is a unique , polarized collider located at brookhaven national laboratory .",
    "rhic comprises two counter - circulating storage rings , in each of which as many as 120 polarized - proton bunches can be accelerated to a maximum energy of 255 gev per proton .    in the 2012 run , the beam injected into rhic typically consisted of 109 filled bunches in each ring .",
    "the bunches collided with a one - to - one correspondence with a 106 ns separation .",
    "pre - defined polarization patterns for every 8 bunches were changed fill - by - fill in order to reduce systematic effects .",
    "two polarimeters are used to determine the beam polarizations .",
    "one is a hydrogen - jet polarimeter , which takes several hours to measure the absolute polarization  @xcite .",
    "the other is a fast , proton - carbon polarimeter which measures relative changes in the magnitude of the polarization and any variations across the transverse profile of the beam several times per fill  @xcite . during the @xmath3  gev",
    "run in 2012 , the polarization direction in the phenix interaction region was transverse .",
    "the average clockwise - beam ( known as blue beam ) polarization for the data used in this analysis was @xmath34 , and the average counter - clockwise - beam ( yellow beam ) polarization was @xmath35 .",
    "there is a 3.4% global scale uncertainty in the measured @xmath19 due to the polarization uncertainty .",
    "we analyzed a data set from transversely polarized collisions at @xmath36 collected with the phenix detector in 2012 with an integrated luminosity of 9.2  pb@xmath37 .",
    "these data have been recorded by using the muid trigger in coincidence with the bbc trigger .",
    "the bbc trigger requires at least one hit in both bbcs .",
    "the bbc trigger efficiency for mb events ( events containing muons from open heavy - flavor ) is 55% ( 79% )  @xcite with the van der meer scan technique  @xcite .",
    "the muid trigger serves to select events containing at least one muid track reaching gap3 or gap4 .",
    "phenix has reported several measurements of muons from open heavy - flavor decays in various collision systems  @xcite .",
    "similar methods developed in the previous analyses for background estimation are used in this analysis . due to the benefit of the additional absorber material , the measurement of positively - charged muons from open heavy - flavor decays is possible in phenix for the first time with these data .",
    "we choose tracks penetrating through all the muid gaps as good muon candidates from events for which the bbc @xmath38-vertex is within @xmath39 .",
    "track quality cuts , shown in table  [ tab : cuts ] , are also required to reject background tracks .",
    "dg0 is the distance between the projected positions of a mutr track and a muid track at the @xmath38 position of the muid gap0 .",
    "ddg0 is the angular difference between the two projected positions used in the dg0 .",
    "@xmath40 is the distance between the interaction point and a projected position of a muid track at @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 is the polar scattering angle of a track inside the absorber scaled by the momentum , where @xmath43 is the angle at the vertex and @xmath44 is the angle at the mutr station 1 .",
    "two cuts , on @xmath42 and @xmath45 at @xmath33 , are effective for rejecting tracks suffering from large multiple scattering or decaying to muons inside the absorber .",
    "track quality cuts are determined with the help of a monte carlo simulation with geant4  @xcite ; the cut values vary with the momentum of the track .",
