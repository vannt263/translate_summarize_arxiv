    "the interaction of the environment with a quantum system tends to lead to a loss of quantum coherence ( decoherence ) , and a transition from quantum to classical behavior .",
    "decoherence has been the topic of extensive investigation in recent years .",
    "( for a review , see ref .",
    "several authors  @xcite have suggested that the gravitational interaction might play a special role in the quantum to classical transition , but this view remains controversial .",

    "however , there seems to be no doubt that gravitational interactions can contribute to decoherence .    in this paper",
    ", we will treat systems where the role of gravity is to provide spacetime geometry fluctuations which in turn lead to length and relative phase fluctuations .",
    "this effect can arise from the presence of a bath of long wavelength gravitons .",
    "first consider gravity waves on a flat background described by a metric of the form ( in @xmath0 units ) @xmath1 where the transverse tracefree gauge is assumed .",
    "fluctuations of the metric lead to fluctuations of the squared proper length @xmath2 , and hence of the separation between nearby geodesics .",
    "this follows from the geodesic deviation equation for the separation @xmath3 , @xmath4 where the relevant component of the riemann tensor is given by @xmath5 in the transverse tracefree gauge . in many situations ,",
    "length fluctuations can lead to quantum phase fluctuations , and hence decoherence through dephasing . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we will treat a simple model in which the length fluctuations arise from fluctuating boundaries , which forms an analog model for the effects of quantum geometry fluctuations .",
    "we apply the lessons of this model to the effects of a graviton bath in sec .",

    "we begin with a non - relativistic particle of mass @xmath6 confined in an infinite potential well whose width is denoted by @xmath7 . for the sake of simplicity , we restrict our analysis to the case of one space dimension .",

    "each one of these eigenfunctions describes a stationary state , as the corresponding probability density @xmath16 is time - independent .",
    "however , time evolution occurs when the particle is governed by a linear superposition of @xmath17 , such as that given in eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "the probability density can be obtained as @xmath18 where we define @xmath19 , the bohr angular frequency associated with the energy difference of the superposed states .",
    "as we see , the time evolution of @xmath20 is exclusively governed by the interference term between @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "in fact , @xmath20 oscillates between its maximum @xmath23 and minimum @xmath24 values , as depicted in the down inset frame in fig . [ fig1 ] , for a particular numerical model .",
    "now we wish to investigate the behavior of this quantum system when interaction with the environment takes place . in order to model the interaction between the system and its environment",
    ", we allow the positions of the physical boundaries to fluctuate under the influence of an external noise",
    ". this can simply be implemented by allowing the width parameter @xmath7 to undergo fluctuations around a mean value @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "note that fluctuations in the width , @xmath7 , lead to fluctuations in the energy levels , @xmath26 .",
    "an accelerating boundary can emit quantum radiation which might interact with the particle  @xcite .",
    "however , quantum fluctuations of position need not imply classical acceleration or radiation .",
    "we view the boundary as being analogous to an electron in a quantum state , such as a gaussian wavepacket , which is not an eigenstate of position , but yet need not radiate .",
    "we set @xmath27 , where the dimensionless parameter @xmath28 is described by a gaussian distribution as @xmath29 with @xmath30 related to the width @xmath31 of the distribution by means of @xmath32 .",
    "the mean value of an arbitrary function @xmath33 over @xmath28 is a linear operation defined by @xmath34 notice that @xmath35 , the mean squared fluctuation of @xmath28 .",
    "there does not seem to be a meaning to averaging the wave function @xmath36 , as it is not directly observable .",

    "we assume a narrow distribution , @xmath40 , which means that only small values of @xmath28 contribute in eq .",
    "( [ 23 ] ) .",
    "we expand the integrand , apart from the exponential , to second order in @xmath28 , and then integrate to obtain @xmath41\\sigma^2 + o(\\sigma^4 ) .",
    "\\label{31}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] further , as the particle is confined ( @xmath42 ) , and the small @xmath31 approximation , @xmath43 , is assumed , we have @xmath44 in lowest order in @xmath31 , the probability density associated with the energy eigenstates does not change when boundary fluctuations are introduced . as may be seen from eq .",
    "( [ 31 ] ) , there is a shift in this density in order @xmath45 .",
    "however , this shift is time - independent , and not of special interest here .",
    "if the particle is initially in an energy eigenstate state @xmath17 , it will remain in this state and its probability density will not undergo appreciable time evolution when small boundary fluctuations are present .",
    "next , we consider the last term in eq .",
    "( [ 22 ] ) , which describes the interference effects occurring in the system . from eqs .",

    "once the small @xmath31 approximation is assumed , in order to solve the above integral it is enough to taylor expand to first order in @xmath28 inside the exponential , but only to zeroth order otherwise .",
    "thus , using the identity @xmath50 and neglecting terms which become unimportant after a finite time @xmath51 , it follows that @xmath52 e^{-\\gamma t^2 } , \\label{43}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 . using this result in eq .",
    "( [ 35 ] ) , we obtain @xmath54 as one can see this term describes oscillations modulated by a factor which decays exponentially in squared time .",
    "the time scale for the onset of this decay is @xmath55 in the case of an electron in a potential well with @xmath56 , this time is of order @xmath57 .",
    "however , once the decay begins , the characteristic decay time is @xmath58 which is longer by a factor of about @xmath59 .    combining the results in eqs .",
    "( [ 34 ] ) and ( [ 44 ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ 22 ] ) , we find that the average @xmath60 becomes @xmath61 as time passes , the last term in the above equation falls to zero for @xmath62 .",
    "thus , the net effect of the fluctuations is to kill the interference term .",
    "neglecting the last term in eq .",
    "( [ 45 ] ) we obtain that @xmath63 which corresponds to a weighted sum of probabilities as occurs when a statistical mixture of states is considered .    the behavior described by eq .",
    "( [ 45 ] ) can be illustrated by a numerical example .",
    "for instance , let us study the time evolution of the averaged probability density when fluctuating boundaries are considered in a particular model with @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in this case eq .",
    "( [ 22 ] ) can be integrated numerically .",
    "the result is depicted in fig .",
    "alternatively we could have used the approximate solution given by eq .",
    "( [ 45 ] ) , which leads to an identical graph , confirming the approximation used in obtaining eq .",
    "( [ 45 ] ) .    as the figure shows clearly , the probability density @xmath66 oscillates around the mean value @xmath67 , converging to this value when @xmath62 .",
    "as anticipated , the net effect of the fluctuating boundaries of the potential well is to kill the interference effect between the two state components @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "finally , when no fluctuations are present , the usual stationary solution holds , as illustrated by the down inset frame in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    in order to have an estimate , consider again the case of an electron in a potential well with @xmath68 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the oscillations in @xmath66 are completely suppressed when @xmath69 , that is , @xmath70 seconds after the boundary fluctuations are turned on .",
    "now we wish to turn to quantum systems where the length fluctuations are due to spacetime geometry fluctuations . however , we first review the effects of a classical gravity wave , described by the metric in eq .  , which can cause variations in the positions of a boundary",
    ". the right hand side of eq .",
    "is the tidal acceleration , or force per unit mass on the walls of the cavity due to gravity .",
    "non - gravitational forces will modify this equation with the addition of other terms .",
    "consider the case where the walls are bound in a harmonic potential with natural frequency @xmath71 .",
    "if the walls are displaced from their equilibrium position by a distance @xmath72 , then the restoring force per unit mass is @xmath73 . in the transverse , tracefree gauge , the riemann tensor for the spacetime described by eq .   may be expressed as @xmath74 let the displacements be in the @xmath75-direction , and write @xmath76 . now eq .",
    "is modified to @xmath77 this is the equation for a driven harmonic oscillator , with damping effects neglected .",
    "let @xmath78 be the frequency of the gravity wave and hence also of the response @xmath72 , so @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "this leads to a result for the fractional change in position of the wall : @xmath81 because damping effects have been ignored , this result is not expected to hold near resonance , @xmath82 , but can be a good approximation well away from resonance . in particular ,",
    "if the gravity wave frequency is above the natural frequency of the bound system , @xmath83 , then the magnitude of the fractional change in position is of the same order as the metric perturbation @xmath84 note that this includes walls moving on geodesics as the special case where @xmath85 .",
    "if the gravity wave frequency is below resonance , @xmath86 , then @xmath87 is suppressed by a factor of @xmath88 , so we will focus on the former case described by eq .  .",
    "the use of the geodesic deviation equation , eq .  , to describe the relative motion of the components of a quantum system , such as the boundaries of a cavity , assumes that the wavelength of the gravity wave is larger than the geometric size of the system .",
    "this arises because we are assuming that the riemann tensor is approximately constant on a length scale @xmath89 in writing eq .  .",
    "thus the gravity wave frequency is bounded both from above and from below : @xmath90    now we wish to replace the classical gravity wave with a fluctuating spacetime geometry .",
    "one way to do this is with a bath of gravitons .",
    "we will use some results obtained in refs .  @xcite .",
    "suppose that gravitons are in a state where @xmath91 but @xmath92 examples of such a state include thermal states and squeezed vacuum states .",
    "if the characteristic frequency of the gravitons satisfies eq .  , the root - mean - square fractional length fluctuations are of order @xmath93 , which now plays the role of the parameter @xmath31 in the previous section .",
    "the factor of @xmath94 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h2 ] ) is motivated by the expectation that in an isotropic bath will all polarization states equally excited , we will have @xmath95 , and hence @xmath96 .",
    "then @xmath93 will be the root - mean - square fractional length fluctuations in a given direction , such as the @xmath75-direction .",
    "[ note that @xmath97 was defined with a different numerical factor in refs .",
    "@xcite . ]    in a graviton bath , there will be quantum phase fluctuations , just as in the model in sect  [ sec : model ] , leading to dephasing and a loss of contrast in an interference pattern .",
    "if the probability distribution for the quantum metric fluctuations is approximately gaussian , then the contrast will decay as an exponential of the squared time , as in eq .  .",
    "this leads to essentially the same decoherence time as in the fluctuating boundary model @xmath98 as before , @xmath99 is the energy difference between the interfering states . even if the probability distribution is not gaussian , eq .",
    "is a reasonable estimate for the decoherence time , although the decay rate may not have the functional form of eq .  .",
    "consider the example of a thermal state of gravitons at temperature @xmath100 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that for such a state @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the planck length .",
    "( note that units in which @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is newton s constant , were used in ref .",
    "this leads to an estimate of the decoherence rate given by @xmath105 here @xmath106 is the planck energy , and we are using units with @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "this result may be compared with a formula recently given by blencowe  @xcite for the decoherence rate by a thermal bath of gravitons @xmath109 this apparent discrepancy probably arises from use of different assumptions . our result , eq .",
    ", assumes a low temperature limit in the sense that the graviton wavelengths must be long compared to the geometric dimensions of the quantum system .",
    "in contrast , blencowe assumes a high temperature limit . in a regime",
    "where our result , eq .",
    "is applicable , it predicts a larger decoherence rate than does eq .  .",
    "this arises because gravitons with wavelengths short compared to the size of the system can be expected to be less effective in producing dephasing .",
    "we may write the decoherence time predicted by eq .   as @xmath110 thus the gravitational decoherence rate is very small unless either the energy difference of the interfering states , or the effective graviton temperature is large",
    ".    a truly thermal bath of gravitons could be difficult to produce due to the weak coupling of gravitons to one another and to matter , leading to very long equilibration times . hawking radiation from black holes  @xcite",
    "is one mechanism to produce thermal gravitons .",
    "in addition , quantum particle creation in an expanding universe can sometimes produce an approximately planckian spectrum of particles  @xcite , including gravitons .",
    "quantum creation of gravitons and other particles are expected at the end of an inflationary era , and could contribute significantly to the matter and radiation in the universe after the end of inflation  @xcite .",

    "this leads to a decoherence time of @xmath116 thus a bath of lower frequency gravitons will be more effective in causing decoherence for a fixed graviton energy density .",

    "this time is still quite long unless either @xmath120 , @xmath121 , or the energy difference @xmath99 are large .",
    "recall that this estimate holds for the case where @xmath122 , the graviton frequency is larger than the natural resonant frequency associated with non - gravitational binding forces . in the opposite limit , where @xmath123 , we see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fractional ] ) that the magnitude of the position fluctuations will be suppressed by a factor of @xmath124 .",
    "this leads to a corresponding decrease in the decoherence rate , and an increase in the decoherence time by a factor of @xmath125 .",
    "in this paper , we have treated an example of gravitational decoherence , the loss of quantum coherence as a result of gravitational effects .",
