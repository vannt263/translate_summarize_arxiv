    "millisecond radio pulsars ( msps ) are formed from neutron star low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ; @xcite ) .",
    "the primary neutron star in an lmxb can gain sufficient angular momentum by accreting material from the companion through an accretion disk , and thus be ` recycled ' to a spin period of milliseconds .",
    "the discovery of millisecond x - ray pulsations in the transient lmxb sax j1808.4@xmath13658 has confirmed the formation scenario from the observational side @xcite . thus far",
    "over a dozen of so - called accreting millisecond x - ray pulsars ( amxps ) have been found ( @xcite ) .",
    "nearly all of them are in transient systems , and for these transients , x - ray pulsations are seen only during their x - ray outbursts .",
    "interestingly , it was suggested that several amxps actually switch to be rotation powered pulsars during their quiescent states ( @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) , although no direct evidence , such as pulsed radio emission @xcite , was found over the time .",
    "the recent observational identification of the msp binary j1824@xmath12452i in the globular cluster m28 has firmly confirmed the suggestion @xcite .",
    "the binary was observed to have an x - ray outburst , and during the outburst , the previously known radio msp in the binary switched to appear like a typical amxp .",
    "this confirmation has thus identified an interesting feature for the evolution from lmxbs to msp binaries , and we may suspect that either these systems would probably be at the end of their lmxb phase or it could be a common feature for the quiescent state of transient neutron star lmxbs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the similar type of feature has also been seen in the recently identified two transitional msp binaries : j1023 + 0038 @xcite and xss  j12270@xmath14859 ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "extensive observational studies have shown that they can switch between the states of having an accretion disk and being disk free .",
    "one particular property in them is that they have sufficiently bright @xmath0-ray emission and are detectable by the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ; see @xcite for j1023 + 0038 ; and see @xcite for xss  j12270@xmath14859 ) .",
    "the emission is variable , stronger in the active accretion state than that in the disk - free state @xcite .",
    "given the property similarities between the two msp binaries and axmp binaries , it is thus highly possible that amxps would also have significant @xmath0-ray emission , as they stay in their quiescent state and would be rotation - powered most time .",
    "this possibility has been explored by @xcite by searching for @xmath0-ray emission from four amxp systems , which include sax  j1808.4@xmath13658 .",
    "nearly four year lat data for the four amxps were analyzed , but no @xmath0-ray emission was found .",
    "however , given the improved sensitivity of _ fermi _  over the last two years ( see   [ subsec : si ] for details ) , we re - analyzed the lat data for them .",

    "we kept events during the time period from 2008 - 08 - 04 15:43:36 ( utc ) to 2014 - 11 - 10 21:04:57 ( utc ) and in the energy range of 100mev to 300gev .",
    "in addition , only events with zenith angle less than 100deg and during good time intervals were selected .",
    "the former prevents the earth s limb contamination , and for the latter , the quality of the data was not affected by the spacecraft events .",
    "we included all sources within 20 deg in the _ fermi _ second source catalog @xcite centered at the position of sax j1808.4@xmath13658  @xcite to make the source model .",
    "the spectral function forms of the sources are provided in the catalog .",
    "the spectral parameters of the sources within 5 deg from sax j1808.4@xmath13658  were set free , and all other parameters of the sources were fixed at their catalog values .",
    "a point source at the optical position of sax j1808.4@xmath13658  was also included in the source model , with its emission modeled by a simple power law .",
    "in addition , we used the spectrum model gll_iem_v05_rev1.fits and the spectrum file iso_source_v05.txt for the galactic and the extragalactic diffuse emission , respectively , in the source model .",
    "the normalizations of the diffuse components were set as free parameters .    using the lat science tools software package v9r33p0 , we performed standard binned likelihood analysis to the lat data .",
    "events below 200 mev were rejected because of the relative large uncertainties of the instrument response function of the lat in the low energy range .",
    "energy ranges of 0.2300 , 0.5300 , 1300 , and 2300 gev were tested in the analysis .",
    "a source at the optical position was detected with test statistic ( ts ) values of 32 , 34 , 26 , and 31 , respectively .",
    "the ts value at a specific position , calculated from ts@xmath12 ( where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the maximum likelihood values for a model without and with an additional source respectively ) , is a measurement of the fit improvement for including the source , and is approximately the square of the detection significance of the source @xcite .",
    "thus the source was best detected in 0.5300gev with a significance of @xmath155@xmath3 .",

    "we manually increased the normalization of the galactic diffuse component to a value 5@xmath3 above the best - fit value , the @xmath180.5 gev @xmath0-ray  emission at the position of sax j1808.4@xmath13658  was still detected , with ts@xmath1532 .",
    "we found only when we increased the galactic diffuse emission by 10% ( approximately 77@xmath3 above the best - fit value ) , the @xmath180.5 gev emission was then detected with ts@xmath159 ( i.e. , @xmath23@xmath3 detection significance ) .",
    "the @xmath0-ray  source was not detected in the previous search using nearly four - year lat data in @xmath180.2gev energy range @xcite .",

    "the lat science tools software package and the instrument response functions ( irfs ) have also been updated from v9r27p1 to the current v9r33p0 and from p7source_v6 to p7rep_source_v15 , respectively .",
    "in addition , the diffuse emission models have also been updated .",
    "all these changes have improved the point source detection sensitivity of the _ fermi_/lat .      including the @xmath0-ray  source in the source model , we performed standard binned likelihood analysis to the lat data , with emission of this source modeled with an exponentially cutoff power law , which is characteristic of pulsars @xcite .",
    "in addition a simple power law was also used .",
    "we used data in @xmath180.2 gev energy range to obtain a overall description of the @xmath0-ray  spectrum of the source .",
    "a photon index of @xmath19 = 2.2@xmath200.1 with a ts@xmath21 value of @xmath232 was obtained for the power - law model , and a photon index of @xmath19 = 1.6@xmath200.4 and a cutoff energy of e@xmath22 = 5.5@xmath203.7 gev with a ts@xmath23 value of @xmath237 were obtained for the exponentially cutoff power - law model .",
    "the low energy cutoff was thus detected with @xmath182@xmath3 significance ( estimated from @xmath24 , where ts@xmath25 ; @xcite ) .",
    "while the significance is low , this result also favors the possible association of the @xmath0-ray source with sax j1808.4@xmath13658 .",
    "these spectral results are summarized in table  [ tab : likelihood ] .",
    "we then extracted the @xmath0-ray  spectrum for the source , by considering the emission as a point source with a power - law spectrum at the optical position of sax j1808.4@xmath13658  and performing maximum likelihood analysis to the lat data in 10 evenly divided energy bands in logarithm from 0.1300 gev .",
    "the photon index was fixed at 2.2 .",
    "only spectral points with ts@xmath264 were kept , and the 95% upper limits in other energy bins were derived . the spectrum extracted by this method is less model dependent and provides a more detailed description for the @xmath0-ray  emission of the source .",
    "the obtained spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] , and the energy flux values are given in table  [ tab : spectrum - point ] .",
    "it can be seen that the exponentially cutoff power law fits the data better , particularly in low energy ranges where no @xmath0-ray  emission was significantly detected .",
    "we performed timing analysis to the lat data of the sax j1808.4@xmath13658  region to search for possible @xmath0-ray  pulsations .",

    "the optical position of sax j1808.4@xmath13658  was used for the barycentric corrections to photon arrival times , and photons within @xmath27 ( @xmath27 ranges from 0110 with a step of 01 ) from the position were collected .",
    "different energy ranges ( @xmath180.2 , @xmath180.5 , @xmath181 , and @xmath182 gev ) were tested in folding .",
    "no pulsation signals were detected , and the h - test values were smaller than 9 ( corresponding to @xmath283@xmath3 detection significance ; @xcite ) .",

    "we also obtained the light curves for the @xmath0-ray  source , with different time intervals ( e.g. , 30 , 100 , and 300 days ) used .",

    "however , this source did not show a significant variation ( @xmath37 ) between the 2006 and 2007 mos data .",
    "we further studied this variable source by fitting its spectra with different models .",
    "the count rates were low in the 2001 and 2006 observations , and probably due to this reason , an absorbed power law can provide a good fit to the spectra . when the column density @xmath38 was set as a free parameter , unphysically",
    "large power - law indices of 36 were favored .",
    "if we fixed @xmath39@xmath40 , the galactic value toward the source direction @xcite , the indices were lowered to 2.93.6 , and the obtained mos ( absorbed ) fluxes were in a range of 1.74.1@xmath41 erg@xmath40s@xmath5 and the 2006 pn flux was 1.4@xmath42 .",
    "however the 2007 pn spectrum , the most significantly detected ( with a count rate of 7.91@xmath43ctss@xmath5 ) among the sources and observations , can not be fit with a single model such as a power law ( reduced @xmath44 ; 20 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "we searched the simbad database and usno b1.0 catalog , no radio or optical counterparts ( generally down to 20 mag in @xmath45 band ) were found .",
    "given the properties , we suggest that this source is either a low luminosity x - ray binary or a background galaxy .",

    "the obtained parameters of @xmath19 = 1.6@xmath200.4 and e@xmath22 = 5.5@xmath203.7 gev are within the parameter ranges for pulsars ( 0.4 @xmath462 , 0.4 gev @xmath47 5.9 gev ; see the _ fermi _  second pulsar catalog , @xcite ) , although the uncertainties are large due to low counts of the source . in addition , a possible orbital modulation has also been detected .",
    "these results support the association of the @xmath0-ray  source with sax j1808.4@xmath13658 .",
    "observational studies of the transitional msp binaries ( i.e. , j1023@xmath480038 and xss j12270@xmath14859 ) have shown that @xmath0-ray  emission is brighter during their active state when an accretion disk appears @xcite than that in the disk - free state , while the radio pulsars are possibly still active but not observable . very likely in the latter state , the @xmath0-ray  emission arises from the magnetosphere of the msps ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the former state , it has been suggested that either the @xmath0-ray  emission is enhanced due to inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of a cold pulsar wind off the optical / infrared photons from the accretion disk @xcite , or alternatively self - synchrotron compton processes at the magnetospheric region of a propellering neutron star is the possible working mechanism for producing @xmath0-ray  emission @xcite .",
    "considering the similarities between the quiescent state of sax j1808.4@xmath13658  and the active state of the transitional msp binaries , it is likely that a same emission mechanism also works in the amxp and thus the observed @xmath0-ray  emission is expected .",
    "the orbital modulation from this source was possibly detected .",
    "however because of the relative low significance and the unique modulation profile , we can not draw a certain conclusion .",
    "the modulation has two brightness peaks around the inferior conjunction ( phase 0.25 , when the companion is in front of the neutron star ) and the superior conjunction ( phase 0.75 , when the companion is behind the neutron star ) respectively .",
    "such modulation has not been observed in other msp binaries .",
    "usually there is only one brightness peak , either around the inferior conjunction ( see , e.g. psr j1023@xmath480038 in @xcite and xss j12270@xmath14859 in @xcite ) and possibly due to the occultation of the photon emitting region by the companion , or around the superior conjunction ( see , e.g. , psr b1957@xmath4820 in @xcite , 2fgl j0523.3@xmath12530 in @xcite ) and possibly due to the viewing angle of the intrabinary interaction region @xcite .",
    "moreover , the orbital signals in these msp binaries are only seen when accretion disks are not present @xcite .",
    "thus the possible orbital modulation needs further confirmation from different studies .",
    "phase - resolved spectra may help identify the spectral differences and the origin of the modulation .",
    "unfortunately the photon counts from this @xmath0-ray  source were too low to allow such analysis .    considering that the @xmath0-ray  emission is from sax j1808.4@xmath13658 , the @xmath180.1 gev @xmath0-ray  luminosity of the source is @xmath49ergs@xmath5 ( for the exponentially cutoff power - law model ) at the source distance of 3.5kpc @xcite .",
