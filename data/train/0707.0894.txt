    "so far five - dimensional ( 5d ) randall - sundrum - type braneworlds  @xcite have been the most extensively studied examples , whereas more recently there has been growing interest in six- or higher dimensional models  @xcite .    in the present paper we will be focusing on 6d braneworlds with maxwell fields . since two extra dimensions",
    "are enough to admit flux - stabilized compactifications while keeping the setup as simple as possible , such brane models allow us to explore some of the interesting features which would be less easily addressed in more string theoretical settings .",
    "perhaps the simplest exact solution of this type of warped braneworlds has been constructed in  @xcite , and subsequent work has addressed the stability issue of this model  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "braneworlds in 6d supergravity have also been much investigated : solutions with 4d maximal symmetry  @xcite or time - dependent dynamics  @xcite have been found , and the behavior of perturbations has been studied in  @xcite .",
    "codimension two branes are often considered in the above approaches , and they are unfortunately associated with the problem of the localization of matter .",
    "namely , a strict codimension two defect does not allow for arbitrary energy - momentum tensor localized on it  @xcite .",
    "( branes with codimension higher than two make the situation worse if one attempts to construct a brane model in seven or higher dimensions while taking seriously into account self - gravity of the branes , as they develop spacetime singularities . )",
    "gravitational aspects of such higher dimensional braneworlds have not been explored thoroughly yet because of this fact .",
    "the hybrid kaluza - klein / randall - sundrum construction of  @xcite evades this problem by assuming that our universe is a 4-brane in six dimensions , with one of the spatial directions compactified on a circle ( see  @xcite for a supergravity generalization ) .",

    "the unit normal to the brane @xmath47 is defined as pointing inside @xmath41 .",
    "we now consider a vacuum brane ( i.e. , @xmath48 ) . in this case",
    "the israel conditions read @xmath49 where various quantities with @xmath50 are evaluated at @xmath42 . eliminating @xmath35 we find @xmath51 , which determines the brane position as @xmath52 the two conditions  ( [ jmn ] ) and  ( [ jtt ] ) completely fix the position of the brane .",
    "this is in contrast to the randall - sundrum model  @xcite , in which the brane positions are arbitrary .",
    "since our brane model includes one kaluza - klein direction , we must impose that the circumference of the ring , @xmath53 is not too large ( say @xmath54 cm ) , whereas if the scale of the `` braneworld compactification '' is as large as @xmath55 cm it will be particularly interesting .",
    "clearly , this can be achieved by requiring @xmath56 . in other words , if the tension of the conical brane is fine - tuned to be very close to the critical value , @xmath57 , the bulk will look like a narrow sliver with a small kaluza - klein circle ( figure  [ fig : braneworld.eps ] ) .",

    "( [ fine - tune ] ) should be replaced by @xmath59 defined below . ]",
    "@xmath60 note in passing that in this setup both branes have positive tension .",
    "if one wishes to avoid the conical singularity at @xmath30 , the regularization procedure as in  @xcite will be helpful .",
    "after replacing the conical 3-brane by an extended 4-brane in an appropriate manner , one can still attain a narrow cone - shaped geometry . however , for clarity we will keep using the conical brane to set the boundary of the system .

    "thus , it turns out that the background configuration in the @xmath64 models is characterized by two parameters , @xmath68 and the 3-brane tension @xmath69 .",
    "the expression  ( [ bar : f ] ) is sometimes convenient as it includes only a single parameter @xmath68 .    from eq .",

    "large @xmath68 also tends to give a large kaluza - klein radius , @xmath75 ( i.e. , the conical brane fails to reduce the circumference of the 4-brane placed too far from it ) .",
    "therefore , in what follows we will assume @xmath76 but not too close to @xmath73 .",
    "the special case with @xmath18 ( @xmath77 ) should be considered separately . since the 6d cosmological constant vanishes ,",
    "the typical compactification scale is given solely by the maxwell field : @xmath78 , where @xmath79 this is an integration constant of the solution but not a parameter included in the lagrangian .",
    "therefore , though @xmath68 is fixed , the background solution still has two parameters : @xmath59 and @xmath69 .",

    "<S> we consider a six - dimensional axisymmetric einstein - maxwell model of warped braneworlds . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk is bounded by two branes , one of which is a conical 3-brane and the other is a 4-brane wrapped around the axis of symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the latter brane is assumed to be our universe . </S>",
    "<S> if the tension of the 3-brane is fine - tuned , it folds the internal two - dimensional space in a narrow cone , making sufficiently small the kaluza - klein circle of the 4-brane . </S>",
    "<S> an arbitrary energy - momentum tensor can be accommodated on this ring - like 4-brane . </S>",
    "<S> we study linear perturbations sourced by matter on the brane , and show that weak gravity is apparently described by a four - dimensional scalar - tensor theory . </S>",
    "<S> the extra scalar degree of freedom can be interpreted as the fluctuation of the internal space volume ( or that of the circumference of the ring ) , the effect of which turns out to be suppressed at long distances . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , four - dimensional einstein gravity is reproduced on the brane . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that as in the randall - sundrum model , the brane bending mode is crucial for recovering the four - dimensional tensor structure in this setup . </S>"
