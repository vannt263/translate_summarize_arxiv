    "we consider that the dipolar moment is confined along the @xmath56 axis by the @xmath106 type quadrupolar moment because the magnetic structure in the afm phase strongly reflects the underlying afq order .",
    "therefore , the region around @xmath135 is not probable .",
    "the wavefunction of the ground state should have a rank 4 moment that is not negligible compared with the rank 2 moment .",

    "however , the azimuthal - angle dependence of the rxs at the @xmath2 resonance indicate that @xmath118 is much smaller than @xmath120 .",
    "this disagreement could be due to the r.m.e in table  [ tabl1 ] , which is the value calculated for the atomic wavefunctions within the framework of the _ idealized scattering length_.  @xcite although we consider that the rank 4 moment should be reflected in the rxs of the @xmath2 resonance , the actual intensity should be re - examined by more realistic theoretical calculations which take into account complex intermediate states more properly .",

    "[ fig10 ] , for rank 2 and 4 .",
    "the definition of @xmath108 follows ref .  .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tabl1 ]      here , we simply assume that an electron in dy with a wavefunction extended toward b and c atoms , which are negatively charged , costs high energy because of the coulomb interaction .",
    "then , the analysis of the interference effect indicates that the charge distribution of the @xmath4 electron is determined by the @xmath101-@xmath102 coulomb interaction , and not by the lattice distortion of b and c. the lattice distortion is caused by the direct interaction with the @xmath3 electrons , not with the @xmath4 electrons although they are more extended .",
    "this conclusion is contrary to the theoretical study of ref .  , where it is concluded that the lattice distortion directly modulates the @xmath4 states and the @xmath1 resonance does not reflect the @xmath3 quadrupolar moment .",
    "later on , however , the same authors reconsidered the mechanism and reported that the @xmath1 resonance can be caused by the @xmath101-@xmath102 coulomb interaction .",
    "@xcite    in the course of the analysis , we assumed that @xmath86 and the @xmath1 and @xmath2 resonances interfere coherently ; the mixing parameters @xmath141 and @xmath142 were fixed at unity , a positive real number . here",
    ", it should be noted that we approximate the energy spectrum of the resonance by only two oscillators at @xmath143 and @xmath144 , which is actually composed of many oscillators of the respective intermediate states . in this sense , the mixing parameter should be in general a complex number .",
    "nevertheless , in view of the fact that all the experimental data , including the ( 0 0 2.5 ) reflection examined in the previous paper ,  @xcite are explained consistently by assuming the mixing parameters as positive real numbers , we consider that the above conclusion must be the case .",
    "this point also should be re - examined by a more realistic theory which properly considers the intermediate states .",
    "we have performed rxs for the ( 3 0 1.5 ) superlattice reflection in dyb@xmath0c@xmath0 .",
    "resonant enhancement was observed below @xmath100 , indicating the afq order in which the principal axis of the quadrupolar moment is canted in accord with the site symmetry of @xmath34 .",
    "azimuthal - angle dependence of the intensities for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 resonances have been measured precisely .",
    "we analyzed the results using a theory which directly connects atomic tensors with the scattering amplitudes of rxs .",
    "the fitting results indicate that the data are well explained by the atomic tensors up to rank 2 .",
    "the rank 4 tensor is little reflected in the data .",
    "however , a simulation of the wavefunction in the afq phase predicts a relatively large value of the rank 4 moment in comparison with that of rank 2 .",
    "there should be some reason the rank 4 moment is difficult to observe in the @xmath2 process of rxs , which should be examined by more realistic theoretical calculations properly taking into account the complex intermediate states .",
    "finally , an intra - atomic @xmath101-@xmath102 coulomb interaction and a direct coupling between the @xmath3 quadrupolar moment and the lattice have been evidenced by the analysis of the interference structure among the thomson scattering from the lattice distortion , the @xmath2 resonance which observe the @xmath3 state , and the @xmath1 resonance which observe the @xmath4 state .",
    "the charge distributions of the @xmath4 and @xmath3 electrons are extended along the directions almost perpendicular with each other .",
    "the b and c atoms along the direction where the @xmath3 charge distribution is extended move away from dy , while those along the direction where the @xmath4 charge distribution is extended move toward dy .",
    "the authors acknowledge dr .",
    "s. w. lovesey for important discussions and comments on the application of his theory to the analysis of our experimental results .",
    "we also thank dr .",
    "s. ishihara for valuable discussions .",
    "this study was performed under the approval of the photon factory program advisory committee ( proposal no .",
    "2001g063 ) , and was supported by a grant - in - aid for scientific research from the japanese society for the promotion of science .",
    "we use a formalism developed by lovesey _",
    "_ to analyze the experimental results of rxs .",
    "this formalism simply deals with the intermediate states as an atomic core hole , and then the resultant scattering amplitude is directly connected with an atomic tensor @xmath145 .",
    "the atomic scattering factor for a resonant process between core and valence states with orbital quantum numbers @xmath146 and @xmath147 , respectively , is expressed as @xmath148 where @xmath149 and @xmath150 are the constant factors for @xmath1 and @xmath2 processes , respectively . @xmath151 and @xmath152 are the spherical tensors which express the state of x rays involved in the scattering process : @xmath153 and @xmath154 where @xmath155 ( @xmath156 ) and @xmath13 ( @xmath157 ) are the polarization and wavevectors of the incident ( scattered ) x ray , and they are also expressed in the form of spherical tensors of rank 1 .",
    "the structure factor for the ( 3 0 1.5 ) reflection is calculated by @xmath158 , where the index represents the four dy ions in the unit cell .",
    "the final scattering amplitude at resonance is proportional to @xmath159 , where @xmath160 and @xmath161 are the energy and width of the resonance .",
