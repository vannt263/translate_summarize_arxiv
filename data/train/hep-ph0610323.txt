    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) exhibits various states of matter depending on the environment  @xcite : a strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) has been discovered at the relativistic heavy icon collider ( rhic )  @xcite and various color superconductors presumably exist in the cores of the compact stellar object  @xcite .",
    "these are widely - known extreme states of equilibrated qcd matter at high temperature and at high ( baryon or quark ) density , respectively . the study on sqgp properties at high temperature has been led by the monte - carlo simulation of qcd on the lattice  @xcite .",
    "the lattice qcd results provide us with fundamental information such as the phase transition temperature @xmath0  @xcite , equation of state  @xcite , susceptibility  @xcite , mesonic correlation above @xmath0  @xcite , etc .",
    "in contrast , at finite density , the lattice technique is not quite successful so far ; it is hindered by the notorious problem that the fermion determinant in the presence of nonzero quark chemical potential @xmath1 is not positive semidefinite ( i.e.  not nonnegative ) .",
    "this problem is commonly refereed to as the fermion sign problem  @xcite .",
    "the monte - carlo simulation based on importance sampling requires positive semidefinite probability for each gauge configuration . in the presence of @xmath2 , however , the probability is no longer a well - defined quantity due to a negative fermion determinant arising .",
    "there have been several techniques proposed to handle the sign problem , e.g.  the reweighting method  @xcite , the taylor expansion method  @xcite , the analytical continuation from an imaginary chemical potential  @xcite .",
    "although these proposals have achieved partial successes when @xmath3 is small , no prescription applicable at high density has been established yet .",
    "this work is aimed to point out that the sign problem is relevant even in the mean - field treatment of gauge fields .",
    "one can intuitively understand it in the following way ; in the mean - field approximation the partition function is estimated from the most dominant contribution of particular configurations that have the largest probability or the smallest free energy .",
    "when the probability for each gauge configuration is ill - defined due to the sign problem , hence , the mean - field free energy may well be problematic .    in the present work we shall focus on a specific manifestation of the sign problem appearing in the simplest model at finite temperature and density .",
    "because qcd is a highly nontrivial theory , applicability of the mean - field approximation is quite limited .",
    "we choose a finite temperature model because the mean - field description presumably works well to sketch the hot qcd phase transition .",
    "the polyakov loop plays an essential role as an order parameter there  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the polyakov loop was closely examined some years ago both in the lattice simulation  @xcite and in the mean - field approximation  @xcite .",
    "recently , in addition , the polyakov loop dynamics near @xmath0 is specifically paid attention  @xcite .",
    "there is also an interesting observation that the entanglement between the chiral and polyakov loop dynamics turns out to be indispensable to understand the nature of the qcd phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "we have already known several indications from the mean - field studies about the polyakov loop behavior at @xmath2 . in the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the effective potential of the polyakov loop at finite temperature and density was first derived in ref .",

    "it is quite nontrivial how to derive meaningful information from such a complex effective potential ; the expectation value of the polyakov loop can not be fixed directly by a minimum of the complex effective potential .",
    "the same problem occurs also in the chiral effective models with the polyakov loop coupling which was first formulated by one of the present authors in ref .",
    "@xcite and has been investigated extensively  @xcite , though the sign problem has been almost overlooked . here",

    "@xcite so that one can determine the expectation value of the polyakov loop without ambiguity .",
    "we will go into details of this issue later .",
    "our findings are all consistent with what has been foreseen in ref .  @xcite .    the concept of this work lies not in solving the sign problem but in observing the sign problem in a manageable way , so to speak , in a clean environment .",
    "we also demonstrate that a technique which we call the _ phase reweighting method _ works fine as a practical prescription in the similar but not the same spirit as in the finite density lattice simulation .",
    "we will employ the dense - heavy model obtained from qcd in the double limit of large quark mass and large quark chemical potential  @xcite ( see also discussions in ref .",
    "the reasons we adopt the dense - heavy model are as follows : first , the fermion determinant is exactly calculable as a function of the gauge field .",
    "second , neither the chiral condensate nor the diquark condensate is involved in the dynamics owing to large quark mass .",
    "third , lattice data is available from ref .",

    "it is a well - known argument that @xmath7 and thus the fermion determinant is real in the zero density ( @xmath8 ) case .",
    "alternatively , we can explicitly look into the eigenvalue spectrum of the dirac operator to confirm that the determinant is positive semidefinite as follows : for @xmath8 , when @xmath9 is an eigenstate of @xmath10 , the eigenvalue @xmath11 is pure imaginary because @xmath10 is anti - hermitian where @xmath12 s are hermitian in our convention . since the mass term is simply proportional to unity",
    ", @xmath9 is also an eigenstate of @xmath13 with the eigenvalue @xmath14 .",
    "one can show that @xmath15 is an eigenstate of @xmath13 having the eigenvalue @xmath16 from the property @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , the determinant consists of a pair of @xmath14 and @xmath18 which makes the whole determinant real and nonnegative as @xmath19 .    in the presence of the chemical potential term",
    "the fermion determinant is not necessarily positive semidefinite .",
    "when @xmath9 is an eigenstate of @xmath20 with the eigenvalue @xmath11 , in the same was as above , one can show that @xmath21 is also an eigenstate of @xmath20 with the eigenvalue @xmath22 which is not @xmath23 because @xmath20 is no longer anti - hermitian .",
    "it is apparent from this explanation that , if @xmath1 is pure imaginary  @xcite , @xmath20 is anti - hermitian so that the fermion determinant turns nonnegative .",
    "if a considered theory has degenerate fermions associated with an internal symmetry under the transformation @xmath24 and the chemical potential @xmath1 is replaced by a matrix @xmath25 in internal space transforming like @xmath26 then @xmath27 , so that the determinant becomes real .",
    "a well - known realization of this comes from the isospin degrees of freedom in flavor ( @xmath28,@xmath29 ) space .",

    "another realization is the color su(2 ) case  @xcite that is relevant to our model study as we will argue later .",
    "the @xmath34-transformation changes the quark chemical potential @xmath1 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : change ] ) . in general cases , however , the @xmath34-transformation does not give an escape from the sign problem because it also swaps color and anticolor .",

    "special for @xmath37 is that anticolor is not distinguishable from color since two doublets can make a singlet .",
    "actually @xmath38 where @xmath39 s are the pauli matrices in color space .",
    "therefore the su(2 ) case is free from the sign problem .",
    "we should note that the fermion determinant being complex is not necessarily harmful on its own .",
    "rather , it is important whether the real or imaginary part of the fermion determinant is positive semidefinite or not . even though the determinant evaluated for a certain @xmath40",
    "is a complex number , the functional integral over @xmath40 amounts to a real value for physical observables .",

    "thus , the imaginary ( real ) part of the determinant vanishes after integration over @xmath40 .",
    "accordingly the genuine problem stems from that the real or imaginary part of the determinant may change its sign depending on the configuration @xmath40 .",
    "we will analyze a simple model to see the sign problem occurring in the mean - field level . as a practice to study the model",
    ", we will make the mean - field approximation in the su(2 ) case for which we do not have to face the sign problem .",
    "we will then observe the sign problem in the su(3 ) calculation and attempt the phase reweighting method to deal with the complex phase of the fermion determinant .",
