    "x - ray binary outbursts occur when there is a substantial increase of matter accreted from the outer accretion disc or companion star towards the compact object ( a black hole or a neutron star ) .",
    "spectral states in x - ray binaries were first discovered to exist in the early 1970s ( tananbaum et al .",
    "1972 ) , when cygnus x1 showed a sharp transition in its spectral energy distribution from a state where its luminosity was dominated by soft @xmath2ray emission to one where it was dominated by soft x - ray emission .",
    "it was also found that this transition corresponded to a turn - off in the observed radio emission from cygnus x-1 ( tananbaum et al .",
    "1972 ) , and it has since been shown that this strong correlation between x - ray spectral shape and strength of radio emission is ubiquitous ( e.g. fender et al .",
    "furthermore , the shape of the x - ray spectrum of a source is strongly correlated with its timing properties , with strong variability generally correlated with strong radio and hard x - ray emission ( see e.g. van der klis 2006 for a review ) .",
    "it was observed from early on that the different spectral states occur at different fractions of the eddington luminosity ( see e.g. nowak 1995 for a review ) . the low / hard state , which exhibits strong radio emission , occurs at systematically lower luminosities than the high / soft states with low amplitude variability and no radio emission .",
    "observations which fit neither of these states show similar phenomenology over a rather wide range of luminosities ; they have typically been called intermediate states when at lower luminosities and very high states when at high luminosities , but their spectral and variability properties are sometimes comparable and sometimes varied ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more recently , a picture has begun to develop in which these spectral state transitions are hysteretic , with the transition from hard state to soft state occurring at higher luminosities than the transition from soft state to hard state ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at sufficiently low luminosities",
    ", it appears that only low / hard states can exist , but the brightest low / hard states are just as bright as the brightest high / soft states ( homan & belloni 2005 ) . at the same time",
    ", the spread in the different soft - to - hard state transition levels for a variety of sources appears to be considerably smaller than the spread in the hard - to - soft state transition levels , with a clustering in soft - to - hard state transition levels at about 2% of the eddington limit ( maccarone 2003 ) , although there do appear to be occasional fainter transitions ( e.g. xue , wu & cui 2006 ) ; one source , v4641 sgr , shows behaviour that is not well fit by any of the canonical states at a luminosity of about @xmath3 @xcite . for the most recent effort at putting together a unified picture of spectral states in x - ray binaries ,",
    "we refer the reader to fender , belloni & gallo ( 2004 ) .",
    "more recently , it has been suggested that the existence of a well - established relationship between x - ray luminosity and radio luminosity in the low / hard state with @xmath4 ( corbel et al .",
    "2000 ; gallo , fender & pooley 2003 ) requires that the low / hard state be a radiatively inefficient flow , with @xmath5 , and with the radio emission providing a good tracer of @xmath6 , the mass accretion rate @xcite .    both the rising low / hard state and the falling low / hard state connect to a radiatively efficient flow in the soft state , where @xmath7 @xcite , albeit at different luminosities .",
    "changes in the bolometric luminosity during the transitions between the hard and soft state are generally less than 50 percent ( see discussion in @xcite , although a jump of more than 50 percent may occur in some cases ; @xcite ) , suggesting that the radiative efficiency of the accretion flow does not change sharply during these transitions . the radius of the inner accretion disc may also not change dramatically during transitions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) although in most cases is likely to be truncated at low luminosities @xcite .",
    "the x - ray luminosities in the rising low / hard state and the falling low / hard state have the same dependence on @xmath6 , but they also join to the same radiatively efficient soft state ( in which the x - ray luminosity has a different @xmath6 dependence )",
    ". this could indicate different radiative efficiency factors in the rising and falling low / hard state tracks .",
    "one might then also expect parallel tracks in the jet power versus x - ray luminosity in the two low / hard state tracks , related to such efficiency differences . if some or all of the differences between the two tracks are related to differences in @xmath8 , the dimensionless viscosity parameter",
    ", then one might expect differences between the tracks due to the theoretically expected @xmath8 dependence in the relation between jet power and mass accretion rate ( see meier 2001 ) .",
    "this would require @xmath8 to change during the soft / intermediate states between outburst rise and decline .",
    "variations in @xmath8 during transient outbursts are expected in the context of the disc instability model for x - ray transient outbursts , and are thought to be caused by a change in the ionisation state of hydrogen @xcite , or the dominant species in the case of accretion discs in ultracompact x - ray binaries which are fed by hydrogen poor white dwarfs ( menou , perna & hernquist 2002 ) .    one tentative report of parallel tracks in x - rays versus radio does exist ( nowak et al .",
    "2005 ) , but in general , the inability of radio telescopes to respond quickly to x - ray transients has led to most of the radio observations of x - ray transients being made in the decaying parts of the outbursts . while this would , in principle , be the case for optical telescopes as well , there have been dedicated monitoring campaigns with small telescopes that have , in many cases , detected the rises of outbursts from x - ray binaries in the optical and infrared before they were detected in the x - rays , simply by monitoring known x - ray transients in quiescence and waiting for them to go into outburst ( see e.g. jain 2001 ; jain et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "there is mounting evidence for the spectrum of the jet to extend from the radio to infrared and even optical regimes in the low / hard state ( and hence the rise and decay ) from spectral @xcite and timing @xcite studies .",
    "the near - infrared ( nir ) emission has been found to be consistent with optically thin synchrotron emission @xcite which appears to dominate the nir regime ( but probably not the optical ) in this state @xcite because the emission drops dramatically in the soft state , when the jet is expected to be quenched . we can therefore use the infrared flux to test whether there are parallel tracks in jet power versus x - ray power in x - ray binaries in the hard state .        [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     @xmath9all soft state data are used for this fit except those above the apparent relation at the beginning and end of the soft state phase ( likely to be during state transition ) .",
    "@xmath10the slope here is measured from the five radio data points .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "2 that the nir is enhanced at a given x - ray luminosity on the decline compared to the rise for the only source with both rise and decline data from the same outburst , xte j1550564 ( based on the extrapolation of the x - ray data on the rise , as explained above ) .",
    "the level of enhancement is @xmath11 dex in nir luminosity , or a factor of @xmath12 .",
    "the nir luminosity at a given @xmath13 ( i.e. the normalisation ) also differs between sources ; this may reflect distance and/or interstellar absorption uncertainties .    a striking observation from fig .",
    "2 is the similarity of the slope of the @xmath14@xmath13 ( or @xmath15@xmath13 ) relation in the low / hard state rise and decline between sources . in table 2",
    "we tabulate the slopes measured for each source .",
    "the slope of the relation for 4u 154347 and xte j1550564 on their declines depends on which hard state data are used , since there is an initial nir rise after the transition to the hard state . in fig .",
    "3 we show the inferred slope @xmath16 as a function of the range of data used to measure the fit .",
    "we use all the data at low x - ray luminosity and impose a cut at a higher x - ray luminosity : @xmath17 .",
    "we plot @xmath16 versus log(@xmath17 ) in fig .",
    "3 . there appears to be a smooth relation between @xmath16 and @xmath17 ; the slope becomes shallower when we include the data at high @xmath13 because of the initial nir rise as the source declines in @xmath13 .",
    "the cut required to measure the @xmath14@xmath13 relation once the two wavebands are positively correlated should be at a value of @xmath13 after the nir begins to drop . at this cut",
    "we have @xmath180.8 and @xmath19 for 4u 154347 and xte j1550564 , respectively .",
    "from table 2 we can see that generally , the slopes in the hard state ( @xmath200.7 ) are in agreement with the radio  x - ray and optical / nir  x - ray correlations found from these and other sources @xcite .",
    "-axis in the high soft state to indicate that the jet is ` quenched ' in this state.,width=302 ]    in addition , fig .",
    "2 shows that all the nir and radio data we use are suppressed in the soft state , indicating its most likely origin in the low / hard state is the jet , which is expected to be quenched ( see section 1 ) .",
    "in addition , the optical  nir colours are red ( @xmath21 ) in all three sources in the hard state , indicating optically thin emission @xcite .",
    "the optical and nir luminosity from the viscously - heated accretion disc should vary relatively smoothly across the state transition , as should x - ray reprocessing in the disc unless it largely depends on the hard spectral component ( see russell et al .",
    "2006 for a more detailed discussion of these and other sources ) .",
    "the emission may also not be smooth if it is correlated with @xmath8 and if @xmath8 changes across the transition ( see section 4.2 ) .",
    "since we see a stronger soft state quenching in the nir than in the optical wavebands in our sources @xcite , the longer wavelengths have much larger ratios of jet to disc contributions ( this is expected since the spectral index of the jet spectrum is less than that of the disc ) .    in table 2 we also state the slopes of the @xmath14@xmath13 relations in the soft state for 4u 154347 and xte j1550564 .",
    "the theoretically expected slope if the origin of the nir emission is x - ray reprocessing in the disc is @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the shallower slopes observed are close to those expected if the origin of the nir emission is the viscously heated disc : @xmath22 @xcite . since we are using a finite x - ray energy range ( 210 kev ) as opposed to the bolometric x - ray luminosity",
    ", @xmath16 may be inaccurate because the fraction of the bolometric x - ray luminosity in this range will change with @xmath13 in the soft state .",
    "however , this fraction would have to change by a factor of several during the @xmath23 one dex drop in @xmath13 for @xmath16 to be inaccurate by a factor of @xmath244 ( as is required if @xmath18 for x - ray reprocessing ) .",
    "we can therefore conclude from correlation analysis that the viscously heated disc is likely to dominate the nir in the soft state in these two sources .",
    "@xcite also found this to be the dominating nir emission process for gx 3394 in the soft state ( from the same data that we use here ) since changes in the nir preceded those in the x - ray by several weeks .",
    "it is unlikely that disc emission contaminating the infrared luminosity plays a substantial role in the observed hysteresis effect in xte j1550564 in the hard state , because the separation between the rise and decline parallel tracks is a factor of about five in @xmath14 ; the disc component would have to be dominating the nir luminosity in the rising hard state for this to be the explanation of the effect .",
    "it would then be quite surprising for the colours to change so dramatically at the state transition and would have to be for some other reason than the quenching of the jet . in the decaying hard state of xte j1550564",
    ", a rise is seen in @xmath25 and @xmath26 as well as in @xmath27 at the time of the state transition , indicating again that the jet power - to - disc power ratio is larger for the decaying hard state than for the rising hard state ( see the discussion of the optical ` reflare ' in jain et al .",
    "in this section we concentrate mainly on interpreting the hysteresis effect .",
    "nearly all models for jet production suggest that the kinetic power supplied to the relativistic jet will be linearly proportional to the mass accretion rate ( e.g. falcke & biermann 1995 ; meier 2001 ) .",
    "the observed monochromatic luminosity of the synchrotron self - absorbed part of the jet spectrum will be proportional to the kinetic luminosity of the jet to the 1.4 power ( e.g. blandford & knigl 1979 ; falcke & biermann 1995 ; heinz & sunyaev 2003 ) . as a result , infrared and longer wavelength fluxes may be expected to be excellent tracers of the mass accretion rate , and would be much less sensitive to changes in the accretion efficiency than at x - ray wavelengths @xcite . however , in at least one neutron star x - ray binary 4u 0614 + 09 , the nir jet contribution is optically thin with the break between optically thick and optically thin emission lying further into the mid - infrared @xcite . for bhxbs",
    ", it has been shown that this break lies close to the nir @xcite but may change with luminosity @xcite .    for a jet being powered from an advection",
    "dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; narayan & yi 1995 ) , it has been suggested that the relation between @xmath6 and the jet s kinetic luminosity can also depend on the dimensionless viscosity parameter @xmath8 , and on some fudge factors related to the fact that the standard adaf treatment of rotational velocities and azimuthal magnetic field strengths are only approximations ( meier 2001 ) .",
    "this assumes that an adaf produces the x - ray emission .",
    "narayan & yi ( 1995 ) did not account for the fact that shear in the kerr metric will enhance azimuthal magnetic fields , even for black holes rotating at a fraction of their maximal rate ( e.g. meier 1999 ) .",
    "we then find that : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the total power injected into the jet , @xmath6 is the mass accretion rate through the disc , and @xmath30 is a correction term which is a function of the black hole spin @xmath31 and the fudge factors which are rolled into @xmath32 .    in the following subsections we use these arguments and discuss possible explanations for the observed hysteresis effect .",
    "let us first consider the simplest possible interpretation of the parallel tracks in xte j1550564  that they represent variations in the radiative efficiency in the rising and decaying low / hard states , with the mass accretion rate being traced perfectly by the infrared flux . here",
    ", we effectively assume that the variations in @xmath8 and the fudge factors are unimportant , as are variations in the radiative efficiency of the jet itself for producing infrared emission . since both the rising low / hard state and the decaying low / hard state are observed to follow the @xmath33 relation ( gallo et al .",
    "2003 ; 2006 ) , they are both expected to have @xmath5 ( a radiatively inefficient flow ) . at the same time , they are both expected to join to the same high / soft state solution , which is believed to be a radiatively efficient ( @xmath34 ) geometrically thin accretion disc ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "xte j1550564 was said to be in an intermediate state between the rise and decline of the 2000 outburst based on timing properties and a power law component in the x - ray spectrum .",
    "however , the blackbody flux was always dominant over the power law flux @xcite , and the radio / infrared jet was quenched so for purposes of this work we can treat it as a high / soft state from its jet properties ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the context of our following analysis . a schematic version of the expected track followed by a hysteretic source is plotted in fig",
    "we then see that the scenario where @xmath6 is well traced in the hard state by the infrared luminosity and in the soft state by the x - ray luminosity is immediately invalidated as this would require the infrared luminosity to be lower at a given @xmath13 on the decline compared to the rise  the opposite to what is observed . to achieve what is observed ,",
    "we instead require the jet ( nir ) luminosity to evolve as the dot - dashed lines in fig .",
    "next , let us consider the possibility that @xmath6 is instead sensitive to variations in @xmath8 ( @xmath29 and @xmath8 are linked through equation 1 ) .",
    "this is a natural explanation for the different state transition luminosities in the rising and falling low / hard states ; it is found by esin , mcclintock & narayan ( 1997 ) , for example , that the state transition luminosity should be 1.3@xmath35 , while it is found by zdziarski ( 1998 ) that the state transition luminosity should scale approximately as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the kompaneets parameter , and is defined as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the electron rest mass , @xmath40 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath41 is the temperature of the comptonising region , and @xmath42 is the optical depth of the comptonising region . in either of these cases , then , one would qualitatively expect that increasing @xmath8 would increase the state transition luminosity .",
    "a similar result , albeit without an analytic approximation for the size of the state transition luminosity , is found by meyer - hofmeister , liu & meyer ( 2005 ) , who showed that hysteresis may result from the different efficiencies of hard photons and soft photons in evaporating mass from the thin disc into the corona .",
    "some of the other hysteresis properties of outbursts seem to be qualitatively consistent with the idea that @xmath8 variations play at least some role .",
    "a larger mass density at the onset of an outburst may lead to a higher @xmath8 when the instability is triggered . if this is the case , then it will naturally follow that both the peak luminosity of the outburst , and the luminosity at which the hard - to - soft transition occurs , will be correlated with one another through the connection to @xmath8 , as has been shown @xcite .",
    "the radiative efficiency of the hot disc will depend on which @xmath14@xmath13 track one chooses , and hence on @xmath8 . in general , the x - ray luminosity is given by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the radiative efficiency .",
    "for a solution where @xmath45 , then @xmath46 . more specifically , when the two hard state tracks must join onto the same radiatively efficient soft state track , then @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the mass accretion rate at the critical state transition luminosity ( which has one value for the rise track and a different one for the decline ) .",
    "let us now take a general form for the @xmath8 dependence of this value , @xmath49 .",
    "the radiative efficiency of the hot disc will then scale as @xmath50 . as a result ,",
    "@xmath6 at a given x - ray luminosity will scale as @xmath51 , since @xmath5 in the hard state .",
    "the @xmath8 variations will thus not lead to parallel tracks in @xmath14 versus @xmath13 if the state transition luminosity scales as @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath8 dependence of the jet power extraction efficiency will cancel out exactly with the @xmath8 dependence of the x - ray radiative luminosity . the estimate of the state transition luminosity given by esin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) can therefore be valid only if the fudge factors vary hysteretically or if the radiative efficiency of the jet varies hysteretically .",
    "the dependence of the transition luminosity on @xmath8 must be weaker than @xmath35 in order for @xmath8 variations to be solely responsible for the parallel tracks in @xmath13 versus @xmath14 .",
    "the estimate of the state transition luminosity put forth by zdziarski ( 1998 ) does have a weaker than @xmath35 dependence for the state transition luminosity : @xmath52 .",
    "this leads to a relation where @xmath53 , a closer match to the observations , but still problematic quantitatively . for a given @xmath14 ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity is @xmath54 times higher in the rising hard state than the decaying one .",
    "the difference between the x - ray luminosity at the hard - to - soft transition compared to the soft - to - hard transition is a factor of about five .",
    "if the observations are to be interpreted in terms of variations in @xmath8 only , then either the state transition luminosity must scale slightly weaker than linearly with @xmath8 , or the jet power must scale more strongly than linearly with @xmath8 ( e.g. if the fudge factors in the meier 2001 relation scale with @xmath8 in some way ) .",
    "the other alternative is that the spectral shape or the radiative efficiency of the jet may change hysteretically .",
    "a test of whether the jet power , or the jet spectrum is the most important factor may come from correlated high resolution timing in the x - rays and optical / infrared bands .",
    "it has previously been shown that a negatively lagged anti - correlation of optical emission relative to x - ray emission ( kanbach et al .",
    "2001 ; hynes et al .",
    "2003 ) can be explained as a result of the jet taking away the bulk of the kinetic luminosity from the accretion flow ( malzac , merloni & fabian 2004 ) .",
    "if the hysteresis effect we see is the result of a different amount of kinetic power being taken away by the jet at the same accretion disc @xmath6 , then there should be a signature in the magnitude of the negatively lagged anti - correlation .",
    "we note that observing the spectral changes directly would be preferable , but this is quite difficult due to the convergence around the @xmath25-band of the optical components from the accretion disc , the donor star , and the jet in most systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a completely independent emission mechanism does exist for explaining the x - ray emission in x - ray binaries  jet emission ( e.g. markoff , falcke & fender 2001 ; markoff , nowak & wilms 2005 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the observed parallel tracks would form a jet  jet hysteresis as opposed to a jet  inflow ( e.g. jet  corona ) hysteresis .",
    "in the pure jet - synchrotron model ( markoff et al .",
    "2001 ) , the nir - to - x - ray ratio can change at a given @xmath14 only if either the spectral slope changes , or the break frequency where the jet becomes optically thin changes ( see e.g. nowak et al .",
    "2005 for a discussion of attempts to test the model based on observed spectral shapes ) . in the more recent , more complicated scenarios , where the corona forms the ` base of the jet ' ( markoff et al .",
    "2005 ) there are additional parameters which can change this flux ratio , by changing the fraction of the power that comes from compton scattering at the base of the jet . given that the physics of the underlying accretion flow feeding the jet is considerably less developed in these models than for adaf and related models , there are no quantitative determinations of what should be the state transition luminosities or how the resulting hysteresis in the state transitions should behave .",
    "it thus seems premature to comment on whether the observations presented in this paper have any implications for or against the viability of jet x - ray models , but we note that we here provide an additional constraint for such models .",
    "these findings indicate , on both observational and theoretical grounds , that there is reason to expect substantial scatter in relations between radio / nir and x - ray luminosity especially if some of the data points are taken during the rising parts of outbursts . at the present time",
    ", it seems that most of the scatter in the relations of gallo et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2006 ) and @xcite are due to the uncertainties in the measurements of the masses and distances of the different systems used to make the correlations , however two recently discovered sources could be exceptions ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . as more data is collected for some of the sources ( especially gx 339 - 4 ) , it may become clear that the relation is multiple - valued , and the hysteresis effects will need to be considered .",
    "we have shown that there is an intrinsic correlation between nir ( which we show comes from the jets ) and x - ray luminosity ; @xmath0 for all three low - mass black hole x - ray binaries in the low / hard state which have well sampled data .",
    "this is not just a global correlation as shown in @xcite , but a correlation that holds in all hard state rise and declines . in the high / soft state , there is evidence for the nir emission to be dominated by the viscously heated disc in all three sources , with @xmath1 observed in two sources .    the normalisation of the hard state correlation can differ with time for a single source .",
    "the infrared flux in the 2000 outburst of xte j1550564 shows a hysteresis effect , in that the rising low / hard state has a lower infrared flux at a given x - ray flux than the decaying low / hard state .",
    "several theoretical explanations for this effect seem plausible , and have direct implications for the accretion process , jet power and the dominating x - ray emission processes .",
    "we have ruled out the possibility that the hysteresis is directly caused by different radiative efficiencies in the inner accretion flow on the rise and decline .",
    "the effect may be due to changes in the viscosity parameter @xmath8 and/or the spectrum / radiative efficiency of the jet .",
    "hopefully , these results will help motivate future observational searches for more examples of jet - disc hysteresis effects and more theoretical work which might help to understand whether the disc viscosity parameter @xmath8 should vary as a function of time over x - ray binary outbursts .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of a new hysteresis effect in black hole x - ray binary state transitions , that of the near - infrared ( nir ) flux ( which most likely originates in the jets ) versus x - ray flux . </S>",
    "<S> we find , looking at existing data sets , that the infrared emission of black hole x - ray transients appears to be weaker in the low / hard state rise of an outburst than the low / hard state decline of an outburst at a given x - ray luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how this effect may be caused by a shift in the radiative efficiency of the inflowing or outflowing matter , or variations in the disc viscosity or the spectrum / power of the jet . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we show that there is a correlation ( in slope but not in normalisation ) between infrared and x - ray luminosities on the rise and decline , for all three low - mass black hole x - ray binaries with well - sampled infrared and x - ray coverage : @xmath0 . in the high / soft state </S>",
    "<S> this slope is much shallower ; @xmath1 , and we find that the nir emission in this state is most likely dominated by the viscously heated ( as opposed to x - ray heated ) accretion disc in all three sources .    </S>",
