    "cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies provide a unique window into the early universe through which we receive information on both the model for structure formation in the universe ( e.g.  @xcite ) and the background cosmology ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in the simplest models for structure formation , based on the gravitational instability of initial density perturbations ,",
    "the acoustic signature in the anisotropy power spectrum provides a clean and unambiguous means of measuring all of the parameters of a friedman - robertson - walker cosmology .",
    "in particular , it offers a standard ruler with which to make a classical test for curvature in the universe ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , structure formation may have proceeded by a more complicated route .",
    "recent investigations have begun to probe the acoustic signature in texture ( @xcite ) and string ( @xcite ) models for structure formation .",
    "their predictions differ strongly from the standard inflationary case and suggest that perhaps without prior knowledge of the correct model for structure formation , the information contained in the acoustic signature can not be extracted . in this paper , we focus on two general questions : does the acoustic signature uniquely specify the model for structure formation ? how robust is a measurement of the curvature to changes in the underlying model ?    as discussed in the appendix , the question of uniqueness is especially interesting in the case of the standard inflationary paradigm .",
    "inflation is the unique _ causal _",
    "mechanism for generating correlated curvature perturbations above the horizon ( @xcite ) .",
    "all other causal mechanisms generate significant curvature perturbations only near horizon crossing",
    ". we will refer to these alternate possibilities as _ isocurvature _ models .",
    "a unique signature of superhorizon curvature fluctuations can be used as a test of inflation . by generalizing the external source formalism of hu & sugiyama ( 1995a ,",
    "b ; hereafter @xcite ) to include backreaction effects in  [ sec - physical ] , we find that a large class of isocurvature models carry a distinct acoustic signature that can be easily distinguished from the inflationary case , independent of the curvature and other cosmological parameters .",
    "the distinction lies in the gross properties of the spectrum , not small or subtle shifts in the peaks heights which require very high resolution measurements to see . as shown in ",
    "[ sec - signatures ] , tell - tale features include the harmonic series of peak locations , the alternating relative peak heights due to baryon drag , and the diffusion damping tail . from this study , we conclude in  [ sec - inflation ] that _ the standard inflationary model with big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) baryon - to - photon ratio bears an essentially unique signature_.    if acoustic oscillations are present in the cmb , as is the case in all but models with significant reionization ( see e.g.  @xcite ) or late formation of perturbations ( @xcite ) , their signature will provide information on the curvature .",
    "the damping tail contains the most robust information , but its location alone can constrain but not precisely fix the curvature . additional restrictions such as a standard recombination history and a near bbn baryon content",
    "are required to make this a sensitive probe of the curvature .",
    "furthermore , in models where the acoustic signature is sufficiently regular , the spacing of the peaks provides a precision test of the curvature even if the baryon content is anomalously low or somewhat high .",
    "it can also be combined with the damping tail to discriminate against truly exotic models . in  [ sec - curvature ] , we discuss specifically what regularities must be observed before the curvature can be unambiguously measured if the correct model for structure formation is not assumed to be known _ a priori_.    the outline of this paper is as follows . the next section contains the derivation of our principle results .",
    "their impact on the features in the angular power spectrum of the cmb is described in  [ sec - signatures ] .",
    "we discuss our main points in   [ sec - inflation ]  [ sec - curvature ] , and present our conclusions in  [ sec - conclusions ] .",
    "this section develops the formalism behind our principle results and illustrates them in a series of concrete examples .",
    "the lessons learned here will be applied in the later sections .",
    "a summary of important conclusions is given in ",
    "[ ss - onesummary ] , so that the bulk of this section may be skimmed on a first reading .",
    "acoustic oscillations in the cmb are inevitable if gravitational potential perturbations exist during the period when the compton mean free path of a photon scattering off a free electron is much less than the horizon scale . in this case , the photons and electrons are tightly coupled .",
    "since coulomb interactions couple the electrons to the baryons , we refer to the system as a photon - baryon fluid .",
    "photon pressure in the fluid resists gravitational compression and sets up acoustic waves in the system .",
    "because the properties of the oscillator are determined by the background while those of the gravitational forces are described by the model for the perturbations , the acoustic signature provides a unique opportunity to probe both the background cosmology and the model for structure formation . here",
    ", we explore the evolution of acoustic phenomena under the influence of an arbitrary source of gravitational perturbations .",
    "this is employed in  [ sec - signatures ] to determine the conditions under which signatures such as the peak locations , relative heights , and damping tail may be considered robust .",
    "these signatures will be observable in the small scale cmb anisotropy if the tight coupling condition is satisfied during the epoch immediately preceding the last scattering event .",
    "in particular , it holds for the standard thermal history where recombination and hence last scattering occurs at redshift @xmath0 .",
    "we start with the fundamental equations describing the dynamics of a relativistic fluid .",
    "the physical interpretation and description of these equations is given below .",
    "the evolution of the photons and baryons in a metric perturbed by density fluctuations in the @xmath1th normal mode is given in the newtonian representation as ( see e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath2 for the continuity equations and @xmath3 -      \\dot \\tau(\\theta_1 - v_b ) , \\\\",

    "the @xmath32 term represents the dilation effect on the wavelength of the photons .",
    "since the curvature perturbation `` stretches '' the spatial metric , changes in @xmath15 gives rise to a dilation effect of the same origin as the cosmological redshift .",
    "notice the sign of this effect implies that the photons will always _ oppose _ a change in the curvature , a point which will be very important later .",
    "similar effects govern the baryon continuity equation .",
    "since the fractional energy and number density fluctuations are equal for a non - relativistic particle , their rate of change is given by the velocity divergence . the additional effect due to the stretching of the volume from @xmath33 also implies a number density dilution of @xmath34 .",
    "the expansion makes particle momenta decay as @xmath35 .",
    "for the photons , this is accounted for by the temperature redshift ; for the baryons , by expansion drag on the bulk velocity ( the @xmath36 term ) .",
    "gradients in the potential , @xmath37 , generate velocity perturbations by gravitational infall .",
    "for the photons , infall is countered by stress in the fluid , both isotropic ( pressure ) and anisotropic ( quadrupole moment ) .",
    "the baryons however are effectively pressureless .",
    "the photon and baryon equations are coupled by compton scattering ( the @xmath38 terms ) which exchanges momentum between the fluids .",
    "since the momentum density of the fluid is proportional to @xmath39 , conservation relates the scattering terms by the factor @xmath40 .",
    "scattering seeks to equalize the bulk velocities @xmath41 causing adiabatic evolution of the density perturbations @xmath42 .    if the scattering is rapid compared with the travel time across a wavelength , the momentum conservation eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : momentum ] ) may be expanded in powers of the compton mean free path over the wavelength @xmath43 . by eliminating the baryon velocity",
    ", we obtain the tight coupling approximation for the evolution of the photons ( @xcite ) @xmath44 the quadrupole term @xmath45 causes viscous damping and is treated in  [ ss - diffusion ] .",
    "it is a higher order correction because scattering tends to isotropize the photons in the baryon rest frame and suppresses the quadrupole . from examining eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tightcoupling ] ) , one can see that baryons decrease the efficacy of the pressure and add an expansion drag term to the momentum equation .",
    "the gravitational infall term remains unaltered since its baryon analogue is identical .      before proceeding with the main task of exploring the acoustic signatures ,",
    "let us review how gravitational effects manifest themselves in the cmb ( @xcite ) . as discussed in ",
    "[ ss - fluid ] , these are the ordinary redshift of a photon climbing out in and out of potential wells and the dilation effect from changes in the spatial metric .",
    "if the metric fluctuations are generated by the density fluctuations in the photon - baryon system itself , the poisson equations  ( [ eqn : poisson ] ) tell us that they are suppressed by a factor of @xmath46 with respect to the temperature fluctuations inside the horizon .",
    "thus the _ self_-gravity of the photon - baryon fluctuations generally only is important outside the horizon @xmath47 .",
    "however this is not necessarily true for metric fluctuations generated by an external source .",
    "gravitational redshift effects _ can _ significantly alter the acoustic signature , and we must include them in the analysis even on small scales .    because temperature perturbations are observed only _ after _",
    "the photons have lost energy climing out of potential wells @xmath16 , the `` effective '' temperature perturbation is given by @xmath48 .",
    "it is this quantity that we measure as a temperature fluctuation on the sky",
    ". it will be important in the following sections to consider the effective temperature fluctuation rather than the intrinsic fluctuation @xmath49 .",
    "the blueshift from infall into a constant gravitational well is exactly cancelled by the redshift from climbing out .",
    "thus @xmath49 may have a large but unobservable offset which is removed in the effective temperature @xmath50 .    on the other hand",
    ", the intrinsic temperature evolves as @xmath51 above the horizon to _ oppose _ changes in the spatial curvature .",
    "thus the effective temperature obeys the relation @xmath52 above the horizon .",

    "it is important to note that even in this case , the temperature perturbation is _",
    "anti_correlated with the source fluctuation immediately after horizon crossing .",
    "this is due to compensation from feedback around horizon crossing and will be important for the question of robust distinctions between models .",
    "we have found that this anticorrelation persists even if the source changes sign outside the horizon or near horizon crossing .",
    "it is of course impossible to quantify all the possibilities that arise from the arbitrary action of a source well inside the horizon .",
    "however fig .",
    "[ fig : force ] illustrates two general points .",
    "large metric and correspondingly even larger density fluctuations are required for subhorizon forcing to dominate over driving effects at horizon crossing .",
    "compare the vertical scales of the upper and lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : force ] .",
    "there are two effects that make forcing around horizon crossing easier than well inside the horizon .",
    "the first is that for @xmath144 a large metric perturbation requires a very large density perturbation , since the poisson equation ( [ eqn : poisson ] ) gives @xmath145 .",
    "also , from the euler equation , pressure perturbations are more important than metric perturbations at large @xmath146 , once the artificial offset due to the @xmath37 term has been removed by considering the effective temperature . from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : oscillator ] ) , the effective temperature evolves according to @xmath147 the source is thus @xmath148 , and if constant , produces a temperature shift of @xmath149 .",
    "exotic spectra of this type require extreme conditions .",
    "more plausible is a model whose forced effects dominate only around @xmath150 where feedback effects still play some role . as we shall see in  [ ss - locationsf ] , this has consequences for the coherence of the resulting oscillations .",
    "the second point is that in spite of the gravitational forcing the natural period of the oscillation , here @xmath151 is still apparent in the harmonic structure . if the source @xmath152 is slowly varying in time ,",
    "so is the phase shift . in fig .",
    "[ fig : force ] , the spacing between the peaks is still regular and corresponds to the natural period despite the slowly varying offset .",
    "thus this acoustic signature is only lost if the metric fluctuations are both extremely _ large _ and _ rapidly varying _ inside the horizon .",
    "if such an exotic spectrum is measured in the cmb , we would have concrete evidence that the mechanism responsible for structure formation requires new physics .",
    "until the spectrum is measured however , we can only consider the broader implications .",
    "the possibility of driven sub - horizon effects raises two questions that we will address in   [ sec - inflation ]  [ sec - curvature ] . are there any unique signatures of the pure cases that distinguish them from these more exotic scenarios",
    "? how does the existence of such exotic models affect our ability to measure quantities such as the curvature of the universe ?",
    "to help answer these questions , we need to understand two additional acoustic effects that can provide clues to unraveling the spectrum .",
    "= 3.5 in    [ fig : drag ]      up until this point , we have neglected the effect of the baryons in the photon - baryon fluid .",
    "this is appropriate for the early evolution and reveals the qualitative structure of the acoustic signal even at recombination since @xmath153 .",
    "nevertheless , there is an important acoustic signature associated with the baryons if @xmath154 is near or greater than this bbn value ( hsa , and hu & sugiyama 1996 , hereafter hsc ) . to include its effects properly",
    ", we must solve the full eq .",
    "( [ eqn : evolution ] ) .",
    "however it is instructive to examine the qualitative origin of the effect first .",
    "( [ eqn : oscillator ] ) tells us that the baryons contribute to the inertial and gravitational mass of the fluid .",
    "thus with a higher baryon content , gravity can compress the fluid more strongly inside the potential well @xmath155 . in the limit that @xmath156 and we observe for only a time short compared with changes in @xmath157 and the source ,",
    "the solution to the oscillator equation  ( [ eqn : oscillator ] ) is @xmath158 the last term represents the baryon drag on the photons and displaces the zero point of the oscillation . since @xmath159 inside a potential well , it enhances the compression and suppresses the rarefaction stage of the acoustic oscillation in the potential well .",
    "the crucial point is that the presence of baryons allows us to distinguish between the two stages from the observable rms deviation @xmath160 .",
    "[ fig : drag ] shows an example based on the source in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sourceform ] ) with @xmath161 , @xmath140 and @xmath162 . here",
    "we take the @xmath1-spectrum at recombination for a baryon content of @xmath163 where @xmath164 .",
    "the neutrino and cdm densities have been set to zero for simplicity .",
    "notice that if baryon drag is significant but not dominant ( middle panel ) then it will modulate the peaks into a pattern of alternating peak heights .",
    "if it dominates ( bottom panel ) , the rms fluctuations no longer possess zero crossings but oscillate around some large d.c .  offset .",
    "either pattern is quite distinctive and as we shall see can separate the adiabatic from isocurvature scenarios in _ all _ cases save those with @xmath165 at last scattering .",
    "finally , photon diffusion leaves a robust signature by providing a cut off scale to the acoustic oscillations that is independent of the source fluctuation .",
    "as the diffusion length passes the wavelength , acoustic oscillations are exponentially damped ( see @xcite ) .",
    "physically this occurs since diffusion erases temperature differences across a wavelength and causes viscosity ( or anisotropic stress ) in the fluid .",
    "anisotropic stress , or the quadrupole , is generated from the free streaming of a dipole fluctuation @xmath11 . as photons from crests and troughs of the original velocity perturbation",
    "meet , their doppler shifts create a quadrupole temperature pattern .",
    "this transfer of power from the dipole to the quadrupole is but a manifestation of a general tendency . streaming transfers power to higher angular moments since the original temperature fluctuation subtends a smaller and smaller angle as seen by a distant observer .",
    "however in the tight coupling limit , streaming is collisionally suppressed by the factor @xmath166 ( the optical depth through a wavelength ) such that in the tight coupling limit , the anisotropic stress is approximately ( see hsc , eq .",

    "( [ eqn : tightcoupling ] ) and the damping wavenumber is @xmath179 to order of magnitude , the diffusion length is the geometric mean of the compton mean free path @xmath180 and the horizon @xmath181 , as expected of a random walk . aside from the residual baryon",
    "drag effect , photon diffusion leaves a distinctive damping signal in the cmb that is only dependent on the cosmological background .",
    "because the damping is exponential , no oscillations survive at @xmath182 regardless of the source .",
    "one complication arises however .",
    "as recombination progresses , the ionization fraction and hence the differential optical depth @xmath38 decreases . the corresponding increase in the damping length",
    "can still be approximated in the tight coupling limit if @xmath183 . in this case",
    ", the diffusion length passes the wavelength while tight coupling holds and the damping can be calculated semi - analytically from the known ionization history ( see hsc ) . if this condition is not satisfied , as is the case for extremely low @xmath154 or reionized models with a long compton mean free path at recombination , the damping must be calibrated numerically ( hu & white , in preparation ) .      in summary",
    "then , we have shown that the evolution of fluctuations acts to resist changes in the spatial curvature , whenever the pressure can be neglected ( outside the horizon ) .",
    "schematically , this is because the radiation or matter in a growing curvature perturbation redshifts faster than average ( c.f .",
    "cosmological redshift , as in  [ ss - fluid ] ) reducing the local energy density and hence stabilizing the curvature perturbation .",
    "it is also a consequence of causality as shown in the appendix .",
    "the behavior of the acoustic oscillations due to sources outside the horizon thus depends only on the initial conditions : whether or not there are initial uncompensated curvature perturbations .",
    "the compensation by the radiation also implies that the self - gravity of the photons produces an important feedback mechanism .",
    "the result is that sources arising before or near horizon crossing stimulate either the cosine or the sine mode of the oscillation , not an arbitrary admixture .",
    "the fact that the compensation mechanism leads to rarefactions in the photon density at horizon crossing for isocurvature fluctuations but compressions for adiabatic fluctuations inside the potential well is an extremely robust conclusion . of crucial importance",
    "is it leads to an observable effect in models with @xmath154 of a few percent or greater due to the drag induced by the baryons .",
    "photon diffusion also leaves a distinct damping tail that is entirely independent of the model for the fluctuations but sensitive to the thermal history .",
    "having studied the acoustic oscillations in the last section , let us now consider what signatures the effects summarized in ",
    "[ ss - onesummary ] leave in the angular power spectrum of cmb anisotropies .",
    "acoustic oscillations are frozen in at last scattering @xmath184 when the compton optical depth to the present drops below unity .",
    "the evolutionary properties of the acoustic phenomena before last scattering influence the peak locations , heights , and damping tail . these will be used in the next sections to devise tests of the model for structure formation and the background cosmology .      at last scattering , each @xmath1-mode",
    "is caught at a different phase in its oscillation .",
    "of course , one can adjust the magnitudes in @xmath1 by choosing different relative weights for the @xmath1-modes at the initial conditions .",
    "we assume that any such weighting is not in itself oscillatory in @xmath1 . under this single assumption ,",
    "the acoustic pattern of peaks is robust to the details of the model even though their absolute heights are not . these oscillations on the last scattering surface",
    "are viewed today as anisotropies on the sky .",
    "thus the @xmath1-space power spectrum is projected onto an angular power spectrum .",
    "the angular correlation function is broken up into @xmath185 legendre moments which represent the power on the scale @xmath186 .",
    "the power spectrum is usually denoted as @xmath187 where @xmath188 is the ensemble average of the squared multipole coefficients .",
    "as we shall see in  [ sec - curvature ] [ ( see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : projection ] ) ] , since the projection of @xmath1 onto @xmath185 is highly dependent on the curvature , knowledge of the physical scale of acoustic features allows a sensitive probe of the curvature .",
    "the physical scale of the peaks is related to the sound horizon @xmath189 as @xmath190 or more generally @xmath191 assuming the universe was radiation dominated before @xmath192 . the exact relation of the peak scale to the sound horizon depends on the nature of the fluctuations and supplies a test of the model ( see  [ ss - reconstruction ] ) .",
    "let us now examine this relationship more carefully .",
    "once the source becomes ineffective @xmath193 , the partition into pure mode amplitudes @xmath142 and @xmath143 of  [ ss - backreaction ] becomes time independent and the acoustic oscillations settle into a pure sinusoidal form , @xmath194 , with phase @xmath195 for sources which peak before horizon crossing , backreaction effects create a two state system ( see  [ ss - driven ] ) . if the fluctuations are not perfectly compensated at the initial conditions , @xmath196 .",
    "compensation tends to create a situation where @xmath197 .",
    "robust predictions arise for the location of the peaks in the @xmath1 or @xmath185 space power spectra .",
    "since the phase is dependent only on the nature of the initial fluctuation , not on the detailed behavior or the source in time or @xmath1 , all such models give definite predictions for the peak locations .",
    "@xmath198 for integer @xmath199 .",
    "furthermore , the harmonic series of peak locations is independent of the background quantities that fix the sound horizon and the angle it subtends on the sky .",
    "the generic adiabatic prediction is that peak locations follow a @xmath200 series in @xmath1 or @xmath185 .",
    "isocurvature models tend toward a @xmath201 pattern ( @xcite ) .",
    "even if @xmath142 and @xmath143 are comparable , as would be the case if a small ( finely tuned ) uncompensated fluctuation remained in the initial condition , the pattern of peaks uniquely determines the phase shift .",
    "this might be the case if the initial conditions contain a balanced amount of coherent adiabatic and isocurvature fluctuations . in most physical examples",
    "however ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , the processes which generate the two types of fluctuations are statistically independent and the two contributions are incoherent , i.e.  generated with different phases in @xmath1 . in this case it is even more unlikely that the two contributions would be balanced to give the same acoustic amplitudes . for incoherent superpositions , the phase is always determined by the dominant component with a change in amplitude , not phase , caused by the weaker component .",
    "furthermore , the phase difference @xmath202 implies that regardless of the phase shift or amplitude variation , the spacing of the peaks in @xmath1 is given by @xmath203 thus the acoustic peaks possess both model information in the ratios of their locations and model independent information for the measurement of background parameters in the spacing between the peaks .",
    "although definiteness in phase is a typical feature of acoustic oscillations , it is not necessarily obeyed by models where the source is still active inside the horizon . in this case , the partition into pure modes through @xmath142 and @xmath143 is time dependent .",
    "there are two limiting cases worth considering",
    ". the source could be scale free in its temporal behavior such that @xmath204 where recall @xmath205 .",
    "this occurs for example if the source behavior is correlated with horizon crossing due perhaps to the onset of a causal mechanism . as discussed in ",
    "[ ss - forced ] , this is in fact the most likely scenario since metric perturbations that can overcome photon pressure become increasingly hard to generate inside the horizon . in this case , the behavior as a function of @xmath205 represents both the time evolution of a fixed @xmath1-mode and the transfer function in @xmath1 for a fixed time , e.g.  at last scattering @xmath184 . if @xmath206 peaks around @xmath207 as is typical , we would expect an irregular first peak followed by an increasingly regular but phase shifted harmonic series .",
    "if it peaks much after @xmath207 , complicated acoustic behavior containing detailed information about the source evolution would result ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : force ] ) . even in this case",
    ", we can see from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : efftempevol ] ) that if the source is slowly varying in time such that @xmath208 , the natural period is still imprinted in the oscillations . in cases where the driving force is large ,",
    "we expect only compressional phases to be clearly visible as peaks in the rms .",
    "rarefactions become rms troughs . using only the compressional extrema , the peak spacing",
    "is then given by @xmath209 .",
    "in the extreme case that the metric perturbations are generated well after @xmath207 , one might also expect stochastic behavior in the source ( @xcite ) . here",
    "the timing mechanism due to the act of horizon crossing no longer serves to correlate the modes . in this case",
    ", each @xmath1-mode receives a different set of impulses from the source .",

    "this washes out the oscillatory behavior .",
    "it is believed that a concrete example of this mechanism is given by the cosmic string scenario ( @xcite ) although whether it is the dominant mechanism or not is currently disputed .",
    "we shall discuss what can be learned in the case where the oscillations are washed out in  [ sec - curvature ] .",
    "let us assume for the present that oscillations will be observed .",
    "a wealth of information is stored in the peak heights .",
    "their signature is more model dependent than the peak locations and provides an excellent means of examining the fine details of the model . on the other hand ,",
    "robust features that distinguish between general classes of models are more difficult to isolate . in this section",
    ", we will examine _ generic _ features in the peak heights that may at least be used as clues for this purpose .",
    "let us begin by examining the familiar scale - invariant adiabatic case . in the tight coupling limit , there are two effects that determine the heights of the peaks : the driving force of feedback and baryon drag .",
    "they are to a certain extent mutually exclusive . as we have seen in ",
    "[ ss - driven ] , feedback boosts the oscillation amplitude above the initial conditions @xmath211(\\eta_i , k ) = { 1 \\over 2}\\psi(\\eta_i , k)$ ] by a factor of @xmath212 .",
    "recall that the fluid first is compressed by its own self - gravity .",
    "photon pressure resists the compression , causing the photon - baryon contribution to the potential to decay .",
    "the fluid is thus released exactly in this highly compressed state into the acoustic phase .",
    "we show in the appendix that the potential in the matter dominated limit @xmath213 , thus the boost represents a factor of @xmath214 enhancement over the @xmath215 sachs - wolfe tail .",
    "the inclusion of the neutrino background slightly lowers the amplitude ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the driving effect does not occur if the potentials are dominated by an external source such as cold dark matter .",
    "hence the prominence of the acoustic oscillations increases if the universe is made more photon - baryon or radiation dominated at last scattering .",
    "baryon drag enhances the compressional , here odd , peaks by a term of @xmath216 .",
    "this alters the peak heights to give the distinctive alternating or offset oscillation pattern but becomes sub - dominant if the potential is intrinsically small .",
    "such is the case for driven oscillations since the potential @xmath217 and decays inside the sound horizon .    for isocurvature models , gravitational redshifts cause the effective temperature above the horizon to be @xmath218 ( see  [ ss - gravred ] )",
    "it is also worthwhile to note that although the fluctuation outside the horizon at last scattering is small in these models , this does not imply that the observable anisotropy from those scales is correspondingly small .",
    "gravitational redshifts from the time dependent potential continue to generate fluctuations between last scattering and the present in the _ same _ manner .",
    "this is generally called the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect . thus an isocurvature model which generates a scale invariant spectrum of curvature fluctuations near horizon",
    "crossing yields a flat large scale anisotropy spectrum just as in the familiar adiabatic case ( @xcite ) .",
    "superhorizon isocurvature evolution makes the photon - baryon fluid more and more rarefied inside a potential well until photon pressure can successfully resist rarefication .",
    "since the first feature is the turning point from the superhorizon behavior , it is not prominent in comparison to the @xmath219 sachs - wolfe effect .",
    "however , the fluid then begins infall into the source wells .",
    "the driving effect of the photon - baryon contribution to the potential wells now proceeds as in the adiabatic case to enhance the oscillation making the _ second _ feature much more prominent than the first ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : drive ] ) . whereas the first peak has a height of order @xmath219 at @xmath220 and is small since compensation eliminates metric fluctuations above the horizon , the second peak has a height of order @xmath219 at @xmath221 , which is significantly larger",
    "since the photon - baryon contribution adds to rather than cancels the source . as in the adiabatic case",
    ", baryon drag contributes an @xmath216 term that boosts the compressional phases .",
    "however in the isocurvature case , these are the _ even _ peaks since compensation demands that if the first feature occurs near the horizon it represents rarefaction inside the potential well .",
    "thus , the second isocurvature peak is lifted even higher with respect to the first by baryon drag .",
    "how robust are these general tendencies ?",
    "the prominence of the acoustic oscillations compared with the large scale tail can be masked or altered by the presence of tilt or features in the initial @xmath1-spectrum as well as by other effects from tensor and vector metric perturbations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these effects are however unlikely to obscure the distinctive alternating peak heights due to baryon drag .",
    "unfortunately , the baryon drag effect may be difficult to observe if @xmath222      unless baryon drag dominates over the acoustic oscillation , as in the case that @xmath223 , the damping leaves a clear signal in the cmb . to demonstrate this robustness to changes in the model for the gravitational source , we compare in fig .",

    "in this appendix , we clarify the role of causality in limiting the behavior of fluctuations outside the horizon and its dependence on gauge .",
    "we show that only inflation can correlate the curvature fluctuations above the horizon assuming general relativity is the correct description of gravity .",
    "moreover in the main text , we employed only the mechanism of compensation , i.e.  the response of the photon - baryon fluid to a source , and _ not _ the full causal constraints which limit the behavior of the source as well .",
    "this proved sufficiently powerful to produce the distinctions in the acoustic signature under the additional assumption that the compensation is provided by the photons . in this case",
    ", the feedback from the photon self - gravity produces the key ingredient in making many of the signatures robust . since in the standard frw model ,",
    "the universe is radiation dominated until near recombination , this additional assumption is automatically satisfied .",
    "there are however exotic models where this assumption is not satisfied .",
    "for example , a decaying massive particle could cause the universe to undergo a period of matter domination before recombination .",
    "for this kind of situation , we need to examine the general case of compensation and additional causal constraints on the model .",
    "causality implies initial compensation in density fluctuations above the horizon since the stress - energy tensor is conserved .",
    "heuristically , the conservation law implies that changes in energy density at any location arise from `` flows '' of energy density current across surfaces , or from displacements of fluid elements .",
    "since fluid elements can not be displaced `` beyond '' the horizon , this severely constrains the behavior of fluctuations at @xmath328 .",
    "however , because the stress - energy tensor obeys _ covariant _ conservation , the exact form of causal constraints on the density perturbation depends on the representation of the metric , i.e.  the gauge .",
    "we have seen in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : continuity ] ) that density perturbations can also change due to the `` stretching '' effects from changes in the metric . a clever choice of gauge can eliminate such effects . let us examine the evolution of the density fluctuation in its local rest frame .",
    "note that this does _ not _ coincide with hypersurfaces with zero bulk velocity for the total matter @xmath329 unless @xmath330 vanishes . in the literature , this has been called the comoving gauge ( @xcite ) , velocity - orthogonal isotropic gauge ( @xcite ) and total matter gauge ( hsb ) .",
    "it represents the metric fluctuations as @xmath331 where @xmath332 represents a covariant derivative with respect to @xmath19 and recall @xmath20 is the @xmath1th eigenfunction of the normal mode decomposition .",
    "these quantities are related to their newtonian counterparts by a gauge transformation @xmath333 . if the line element @xmath334 is to remain unchanged ( to first order in @xmath335 ) , @xmath336 a similar relation follows for the stress energy tensor @xmath337 and relates the matter quantities . for densities",
    ", it is simpler to note that it arises from a combination of a shift in time slicing and the background density evolution : @xmath338 .",
    "these relations imply that from the newtonian gauge , the rest frame is reached by the coordinate shift @xmath339 , and the perturbation quantities are related by @xmath340 where @xmath341 and subscript @xmath342 denotes quantities of the total fluid from a sum over the particle constituents . here",
    "we have used the background evolution equation @xmath343 . note that the velocity @xmath329 is the same in the newtonian and rest frame gauges since its transformation properties depend on @xmath344 .",
    "the familiar quantity @xmath345 is the curvature of the spatial hypersurfaces in this gauge ( @xcite ) .",
    "applying the gauge transformation eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ntotmg ] ) to the newtonian gauge equations or writing the einstein equations in this gauge ( see hsb , eq .  ( 16 ) , @xcite eq .",
    "4.7 ) , we obtain the evolution equation for the curvature , @xmath346 unless @xmath347 as in the case of the de sitter phase , the rest frame curvature remains constant in the absence of isotropic ( pressure ) or anisotropic stress perturbations .",
    "the isotropic stress perturbation can be broken up into an adiabatic and non - adiabatic part @xmath348 with the sound speed of the total fluid given by @xmath349 .",
    "the adiabatic pressure perturbation is related to the curvature fluctuation by a factor of @xmath350 through the poisson equation and hence is a negligible source for @xmath351 .",
    "the generalized compensation law is therefore that component evolution must balance at @xmath352 to keep the rest frame curvature constant in the absence of non - adiabatic isotropic stress ( `` entropy '' ) or anisotropic stress perturbations .",
    "note that unlike the adiabatic isotropic stress , both of these sources are the same in any frame and admit no gauge ambiguity .",
    "since the continuity equation in this gauge is @xmath353 for each of the individual particle species , the rest frame density perturbation obeys an ordinary conservation law if these stresses are absent ( @xmath354 ) . in other words , the number density of each of the particle constituents only changes through their bulk motion .",
    "thus we see that the causal constraint is simplest in the rest frame .",
    "note that eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : simplecontinuity ] ) and ( [ eqn : zetaevol ] ) imply that although density fluctuations can change purely due to an evolving equation of state , this does not affect the curvature fluctuation @xmath345 above the horizon .",
    "now let us consider the source of curvature fluctuations from non - adiabatic pressure perturbations .",
    "the analysis also applies to anisotropic stress perturbations .",
    "the curvature fluctuation generated by pressure perturbations is of order @xmath355 .",
    "this fact is somewhat counterintuitive since the physical mechanism that converts a pressure fluctuation to a density fluctuation is the movement of matter which is impossible beyond the horizon .",
    "let us examine its qualitative origin .",
    "causality constraints in fourier space do not require _ no _ evolution for @xmath352 .",
    "in physical space , motion of matter through length scales up to @xmath181 cause a suppressed evolution of the fourier amplitude .",
    "a change in momentum density of the fluid is caused by the pressure gradient and generates a bulk velocity of order @xmath356 .",
    "this then forms a kinematic density fluctuation from the continuity equation ( [ eqn : simplecontinuity ] ) of order @xmath357 or a curvature fluctuation of order @xmath358 .",
    "thus the residual curvature fluctuation induced by motion of matter inside the horizon is generically of order @xmath359 times the pressure perturbation .",
    "causality implies that before matter has had a chance to move around , the universe must obey the isocurvature condition @xmath360 or @xmath361 . aside from a @xmath360 decaying mode",
    "[ see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : decayingmode ] ) ] . ]",
    "if the condition is met by balancing perturbations in the different components of the fluid , a non - adiabatic pressure fluctuation generically arises @xmath362 if the equation of state of the balancing components differ .",
    "as we have seen , @xmath363 _ can _ produce a curvature fluctuation even at @xmath47 .",
    "how does this possibility affect our arguments concerning the uniqueness of the inflationary spectrum ?",
    "first , we need to relate the rest frame curvature to the newtonian curvature . employing the continuity equation ( @xcite , eq .",
    "4.7 ) in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ntotmg ] ) , we find ( @xcite ) @xmath364 in the absence of anisotropic stress . if the equation of state is constant and @xmath15 evolves as a power law , @xmath365 . the two curvature fluctuations are comparable except in the degenerate case where @xmath360 and @xmath366 .",
    "\\label{eqn : decayingmode}\\ ] ] in fact , this is the case of the source - free decaying mode described by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : puremodes ] ) .",
    "the decaying mode thus carries no curvature perturbation in the rest frame .",
    "the other case in which @xmath345 and @xmath15 behave differently is through a change in the equation of state .",
    "for example , through the matter radiation transition @xmath367 goes from @xmath368 .",
    "although @xmath345 remains constant in the absence of stress perturbations , @xmath369 drops by a factor of @xmath370 through the transition . for most purposes",
    "however , we can think of @xmath345 and @xmath15 as nearly interchangeable .",
    "the mechanism by which non - adiabatic pressure perturbations generate curvature fluctuations is of course already implicitly encorporated in our analysis and is the cause of the curvature not being strictly zero outside at @xmath47 but merely suppressed . in the photon",
    "dominated limit , only a small pressure fluctuation is needed to compensate a rather large density fluctuation in the source .",
    "thus , the curvature generated by this effect is negligible . in the matter",
    "dominated limit , pressure fluctuations can not move a large amount of energy density as exhibited by the @xmath359 suppression .",
    "however , as the universe changes from radiation to matter domination a relatively significant curvature fluctuation can be generated .",
    "the baryon isocurvature model provides a concrete example . in this case , the non - adiabatic pressure perturbation is @xmath371 where recall that @xmath372 is the entropy fluctuation .",
    "notice that the pressure fluctuation is small as long as the universe is radiation dominated @xmath373 .",
    "the evolution equations may be exactly solved in the @xmath47 limit such that the newtonian curvature is @xmath374 in the radiation - dominated limit and @xmath375 in the matter dominated limit ( see hsb , eq .  27 ) .",
    "notice that the curvature is a constant in the matter dominated limit even outside the horizon .",
    "around equality , pressure perturbations of order @xmath110 generate curvature fluctuations of the same order . since in the matter dominated limit , pressure is no longer effective , this curvature fluctuation is frozen in .",
    "if one considers the evolution of a single @xmath1-mode , distinguishing between this and the inflationary case would be difficult since they both exhibit a constant curvature fluctuation above the horizon . in the standard scenario , this is not a problem since the matter - radiation transition can not occur early enough without overclosing the universe @xmath376 ) .",
    "note that the curvature fluctuation must be constant well before horizon crossing for all observable scales in order to mimic inflation .",
    "however it is possible with decaying massive particle scenarios for the universe to undergo a period of matter - domination before the ordinary radiation - dominated epoch .    in this case , the spectrum of non - adiabatic pressure perturbations implied by causality serves to distinguish the model from inflation .",
    "causality forbids spatial correlations in the spectrum of such perturbations , so @xmath377 and hence @xmath378 are constant in @xmath1 , i.e.  white noise ( or steeper if symmetries can be imposed ) , before horizon crossing . notice that this agrees with the familiar result that the density perturbations generated by the motion of matter have a @xmath379 tail for @xmath352 ( @xcite )",
    "this translates to a steeply rising spectrum of acoustic fluctuations compared with the inflationary case of an approximately scale invariant spectrum @xmath380 .",
    "thus acoustic modes associated with a constant curvature perturbation outside the horizon generated from an isocurvature initial condition are both easily distinguished from inflation and observationally ruled out ! the most general isocurvature spectrum with scale invariant curvature perturbations at horizon",
    "crossing is @xmath381 . with the requirement of white noise perturbations outside the horizon ,",
    "@xmath15 must grow as @xmath382 before horizon crossing . since only models like these , with curvature fluctuations growing until horizon crossing , require observation of the acoustic signature to distinguish them from inflation , our assumption in the main text is justified .",
    "it is of course still possible that tuned effects around horizon crossing can mimic an inflationary spectrum in such a exotic scenario where the regulatory effects of photon feedback are absent .",
    "however , since both tuning and a drastic modification of the thermal history is necessary , we do not consider this possibility to be worth considering .",

    "<S> we study the uniqueness and robustness of acoustic signatures in the cosmic microwave background by allowing for the possibility that they are generated by some as yet unknown source of gravitational perturbations . the acoustic _ pattern _ of peak locations and relative heights predicted by the standard inflationary cold dark matter model is essentially unique and its confirmation would have deep implications for the causal structure of the early universe . </S>",
    "<S> a generic pattern for isocurvature initial conditions arises due to backreaction effects but is not robust to exotic source behavior inside the horizon . </S>",
    "<S> if present , the acoustic pattern contains unambiguous information on the curvature of the universe even in the general case . by classifying the behavior of the unknown source , we determine the minimal observations necessary for robust constraints on the curvature . </S>",
    "<S> the diffusion damping scale provides an entirely model independent cornerstone upon which to build such a measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the peak spacing , if regular , supplies a precision test .    </S>",
