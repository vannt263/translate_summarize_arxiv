    "osmotic pressure was taken into account , but the hydrostatic pressure was not fully described . as in the previous theories ,",
    "we ignore the hydrostatic pressure .",
    "our results , nevertheless , reproduce the classical results obtained by virial expansion in the absence of short polymers .",
    "various types of shape transformations of the long polymer can be obtained when the solvent acts as a good solvent for the long polymer and a poor solvent for short polymers and vice versa . these competitive interactions and",

    "the partition function was maximized by assuming that the number of short polymers @xmath17 inside the region occupied by the long polymer was conserved against the infinitesimal change in the gyration radius @xmath5 of the long polymer .",

    "the simplified shape equation captured the main features of the nonlinear shape equation and thus is very useful to analytically investigate the shape transition of polymers .",
    "previously , the shape transition had been extensively studied using the simplified equation obtained by the virial expansion in the absence of short polymers .",
    "@xcite guided by this simplified equation , we systematically studied the shape transition of a long polymer induced by the presence of short polymers .    using the simplified shape equation and the effective @xmath0-parameter @xmath158",
    ", we showed that coil - to - globule transitions can be induced by increasing @xmath17 when the solvent acts as a good solvent for the long polymer and a poor solvent for the short polymers .",
    "the long polymer tends to extend in a good solvent and short polymers tend to aggregate in a poor solvent . under the competitive effect induced by such a solvent , the long polymer shrinks if the long polymer segments are involved in excluded - volume interactions with a sufficient number of short polymers .",
    "these transitions were confirmed by numerical calculations using the complete shape equation .",
    "in contrast , globule - to - coil transitions can be induced by increasing @xmath17 when the solvent acts as a poor solvent for the long polymer .",
    "this is because long polymer shrinks in the poor solvent , but expands through the excluded - volume interaction between the long polymer segments and short polymers .",
    "the globule - to - coil transition occurs at a lower concentration of short polymers when the solvent acts as a good solvent for the short polymers compared to that in the case where the solvent acts as a poor solvent for the short polymers .",
    "the globule - to - coil transition of a long polymer results from excluded - volume interaction with a sufficient number of short polymers and the threshold value for the number of short polymers can be low when the short polymers tend to be well dispersed in the good solvent .    the excluded - volume effects can be also taken into account by considering the site - mixing entropy of the lattice model .",
    "however , there was some ambiguity in defining the effective volume of a long polymer to combine the site - mixing entropy and entropic elastic energy of a long polymer .",
    "we show that the minimization of the total free energy leads to the equation for the optimal expansion factor derived using the partition function if the mean volume is defined by @xmath159 , where @xmath3 is the kuhn length and @xmath5 denotes the radius of gyration of the long polymer .    in a related topic ,",

    "@xcite the reduction factor for folding states was obtained from a scaled - particle theory.@xcite the reduction factor for unfolding states was expressed using the unoccupied volume to place the protein and the fraction of the reduced protein conformations due to prohibiting overlapping with crowding objects . by calculating the folding free energy using a reduction factor , the folding stability was discussed . although the method of calculation is different , entropy reduction by excluded volume effect was taken into account both in the present theory and in the theory of protein folding stability . in this sense",
    ", this study gives another insight into the effect of macromolecular crowding using a single polymer chain .",
    "in this paper , we have implicitly assumed that the long polymer is flexible .",
    "flexibility of conjugated polymers can be increased by formation of defects .",
    "although conjugated polymers are stiff , various compact shapes of conjugated polymers were simulated by introducing defects .",
    "@xcite it has been pointed out that the folding characteristics of a long semiflexible chain differ from those of a short stiff chain .",
    "@xcite recently , it was demonstrated that a polymer of intermediate length formed various types of collapsed states , while the spherical collapsed state was obtained for long polymers .",
    "@xcite spherical symmetric globules can be also classified into several states .",
    "@xcite it was also shown that combined effect of rigidity and hydrophobicity is correlated with the folding kinetics and structures.@xcite to identify the shape of a long polymer , its stiffness , chemical interactions and finite length should be explicitly considered .",
    "although such complexity was ignored in this paper , the competitive and cooperative effects of excluded volume and the interaction between monomers and solvents were taken into account in this work using the partition function in the mean field approximation . by maximizing the partition function",
    ", we showed that various kinds of transition between the coil and globule states are possible by adding two different solvents , even if one of the solvents is short polymers .",
    "in particular , we qualitatively show that the shape transition can be induced by the excluded volume interactions if solvent acts as good ( poor ) solvent for a long polymer and poor ( good ) solvent for short macromolecules .",
