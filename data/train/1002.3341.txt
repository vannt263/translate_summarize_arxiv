    "despite nearly a century of observational and theoretical progress , the origin of the cosmic ray spectrum remains a major puzzle of modern astrophysics .",
    "the task of identifying the sources of these particles is complicated by the non - trivial processes involved in cosmic ray propagation .",
    "although cosmic ray composition and spectrum measurements have taught us a great deal about the acceleration and propagation of cosmic rays , we still lack a detailed and self - consistent understanding of how these particles are produced , and how they travel through and interact with the interstellar medium .    below the spectral feature known as the knee ( @xmath0 ev )",
    ", the bulk of the cosmic ray spectrum is believed to be of galactic origin .",
    "non - relativistic shocks occurring in supernova remnants seem to be likely sources , and are predicted to accelerate cosmic rays with a power - law injection spectrum @xmath1 with @xmath2 @xcite . at higher energies , even less",
    "is known about the origin of the cosmic ray spectrum . in this work ,",
    "we focus solely on galactic cosmic rays at energies well below the knee .",
    "our understanding of how cosmic rays propagate through the milky way is informed largely by measurements of the spectra of various cosmic ray species as observed at earth . in particular , by comparing the spectrum of particles produced in cosmic ray accelerators ( primaries ) to those that are produced by inelastic processes during propagation of primary particles ( secondaries ) , we can learn about the mechanisms involved in cosmic ray propagation .",
    "while stable secondary - to - primary ratios ( such as boron - to - carbon and antiproton - to - proton ) provide information that can be used to constrain the effective column density cosmic rays pass through before reaching the solar system , unstable ratios ( such as beryllium-10-to - beryllium-9 ) are useful in constraining the time interval since spallation .",
    "combinations of such observations make it possible to constrain the basic properties of relatively simple cosmic ray propagation models .    to date ,",
    "some of the most precise cosmic ray measurements over the gev - tev energy range have been made by the cream ( boron - to - carbon )  @xcite , pamela ( antiproton - to - proton )  @xcite , isomax ( @xmath3be - to-@xmath4be )  @xcite , and heao-3 ( subiron - to - iron , boron - to - carbon )  @xcite experiments .",
    "these measurements have been used to place fairly stringent constraints on the parameters of the underlying cosmic ray propagation model  @xcite . in this article , we extend this approach to include data anticipated from the alpha magnetic spectrometer ( ams-02 ) experiment , which is scheduled to be deployed on the international space station in 2010 . with its greater acceptance and superior particle identification relative to previous experiments , measurements from ams-02",
    "are expected to dramatically improve our understanding of the processes involved in galactic cosmic ray propagation .",
    "once injected from their sources into the interstellar medium , charged cosmic rays @xmath5 unlike photons or neutrinos @xmath5 undergo a number of processes potentially capable of significantly altering their spectra ( for a recent review , see ref .",
    "the galactic magnetic field , in particular , is responsible for deflecting charged particles , leading them to diffuse gradually throughout the galaxy , following paths resembling a random walk .",
    "particles with greater energy , and therefore rigidity , diffuse more efficiently and tend to escape the galaxy more quickly , whereas less energetic cosmic rays are typically confined by the galactic magnetic field for a greater duration .",
    "an essentially inevitable consequence of high energy particle scattering in the turbulent magnetic field is stochastic acceleration , also known as diffusive reacceleration  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism gives rise to diffusion in momentum space with a diffusion coefficient determined by the spatial diffusion coefficient and the alfvn velocity , which represents the typical velocity at which magnetic irregularities propagate in the interstellar medium .",
    "other potentially important effects to consider include galactic winds , which may result in the convection of particles away from the galactic plane , as well as various energy loss processes .",
    "such energy losses occur as a result of the cosmic rays traversing the galactic medium , which is permeated with gas , radiation fields , and magnetic fields . in the case of nuclei coulomb and ionization energy losses",
    "exist , but they play only a minor role in their propagation . on the other hand ,",
    "gev electrons and positrons lose significant quantities of energy through inverse compton and synchrotron processes ; at lower energies , ionization , coulomb interactions , and bremsstrahlung processes may also be relevant .",
    "furthermore , the decays of unstable , radioactive species must be taken into account , including the introduction of any relevant decay products .",
    "lastly , cosmic ray spallation on the interstellar medium can lead to the extinction of the incident particle and to the creation of a secondary flux consisting of gamma rays from neutral pion decay , electrons , positrons , protons , antiprotons and nuclei .",
    "the rate at which spallation occurs is fixed by the nuclear cross sections involved , and by the distribution of gas ( mainly h and he ) present in the milky way .",
    "the transport equation that describes all of the above - mentioned processes for a cosmic ray species @xmath6 ( with atomic number @xmath7 and mass number @xmath8 ) is given by  @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number density of particles of species @xmath6 per unit momentum , @xmath11 is the rigidity , @xmath12 is the spatial diffusion coefficient , @xmath13 is the convection velocity , @xmath14 is the momentum space diffusion coefficient , @xmath15 is the decay time , @xmath16 is the spallation time , and @xmath17 is the energy loss rate .",
    "notice that the source term @xmath18 includes the primary injection spectrum @xmath19 ( typically assumed to be from acceleration in supernova remnants ) as well as the products of decay and spallation of heavier cosmic ray species .",
    "@xmath18 may also include exotic primary contributions produced , for example , by dark matter annihilations taking place in the halo of the milky way .",
    "such components are not considered in this study , however .",
    "the standard approach used to solve eq .",
    "is to assume that the cosmic rays are in steady state , such that @xmath20 ( or to solve iteratively the full equation until an approximate steady state is reached ) . to further simplify the problem , it is common to adopt a cylindrical diffusive region ( of radius @xmath21 and half - thickness @xmath22 ) inside which the diffusion coefficient does not vary with location , and such that the number density of cosmic rays approaches zero at the boundaries .",
    "the half - thickness of the cylindrical diffusive region , @xmath22 , is generally much larger than the half - thickness of the galactic disk @xmath23 kpc .",
    "to proceed , one may either apply ( semi-)analytical methods ( e.g.  @xcite ) or make use of numerical codes ( e.g.  galprop @xcite or dragon @xcite ) . in the present work , we use galprop v50.1p  @xcite which solves eq .   by assuming a homogeneous power - law coefficient , @xmath24 in a cylindrical diffusive region as described above where the sun sits at @xmath25 kpc .",
    "galprop implements a realistic interstellar hydrogen distribution and interstellar radiation field based on state - of - the - art surveys , and makes use of an up - to - date nuclear reaction network .",
    "the primary sources of cosmic rays are assumed to have a unique single or double power - law injection spectrum and isotope composition .",
    "moreover , the distribution of sources can be specified but is typically chosen such that the egret gamma ray data are well reproduced .",
    "convection , if implemented , is assumed to move particles along the vertical direction , perpendicular to and away from the disk and with a linear profile , @xmath26 diffusive reacceleration with a given alfvn velocity , @xmath27 , is also included , and is modelled with a diffusion coefficient @xmath28 the local interstellar flux of species @xmath6 , @xmath29 , follows from the solution of eq .   through @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the kinetic energy per nucleon .",
    "finally , this flux is modulated by the solar wind before arriving at the top of the atmosphere , as calculated using the force field approximation  @xcite .",
    "further details pertaining to the galprop package are described in refs .",
    "the second and final version of the alpha magnetic spectrometer ( ams-02 ) @xcite is a large acceptance cosmic ray detector scheduled to be placed onboard the international space station in 2010 . over its mission duration of at least three years",
    ", it will measure with unprecedented statistics and precision the spectrum of cosmic rays over an energy range of approximately 100 mev to 1 tev  @xcite",
    ". the ams-02 instrument will be able to detect and identify nuclei as heavy as iron ( @xmath32 ) with rigidity up to 4 tv  @xcite , and separate isotopes of light elements ( namely , h , he and be ) over a kinetic energy range of 0.5@xmath510 gev / n @xcite . high precision measurements of the ratios b / c and sub - fe / fe ( d / p , @xmath33he/@xmath34he and @xmath3be/@xmath4be ) up to energies of @xmath351 tev / n ( @xmath3510 gev / n ) are anticipated . due to a high level of proton rejection , positron and antiproton spectra will also be measured with unprecedented precision  @xcite .",
    "the principal goals of the ams-02 experiment  @xcite include searches for primordial anti - matter among cosmic ray nuclei and signatures of dark matter annihilations or decays .",
    "additionally , however , ams-02 will contribute considerably to our understanding of the origin , acceleration , and propagation of galactic cosmic rays .",
    "in fact , being the largest acceptance ( @xmath36 ) space - based magnetic spectrometer , ams-02 will bypass the atmospheric systematics which affect baloon - borne experiments and simultaneously feature an acceptance more than two orders of magnitude above the @xmath37 of the pamela satellite @xcite . besides largely improved statistics , ams-02 will also provide cosmic ray flux measurements up to @xmath35 tev / n and separate be isotopes up to @xmath38 gev / n while pamela can only reach a few hundred gev / n and separate h and he isotopes .",
    "therefore , a precise b / c ratio over a wide energy range and high energy @xmath3be/@xmath4be measurements will be obtained .",
    "these data are extremely useful in constraining cosmic ray diffusion parameters .",
    "of particular importante will be the ratio @xmath3be/@xmath4be since as of today there are no data points above 3 gev / n .    focusing on the ratios b / c , @xmath3be/@xmath4be and @xmath39 , we can estimate the systematic and statistical errors of ams-02 . to begin , the rigidity resolution of ams-02 will be @xmath40@xmath41% at @xmath35@xmath42 gv , for both protons and he nuclei , and around 20% at @xmath35@xmath43 tv ( @xmath35@xmath44 tv ) for protons",
    "( he )  @xcite . assuming similar capabilities for heavier nuclei as well , we take a conservative value @xmath45% , which in the case of relativistic particles translates directly into a kinetic energy resolution @xmath46% .",
    "such resolution allows logarithmic bins of width @xmath47 , or 11@xmath512 bins per decade . in the following",
    "we assume 10 bins per decade of kinetic energy regardless of the cosmic ray species .",
    "in order to compute the statistical errors associated with the ratio @xmath48 , we need the number of @xmath6 and @xmath49 particles detected , @xmath50 ( and likewise for @xmath49 ) , @xmath51 being the efficiency , @xmath52 the geometrical acceptance of the instrument , and @xmath53 the operating time .",
    "then , @xmath54 .",
    "the geometrical acceptance is a function of the particle type ; we adopt @xmath55 @xcite , @xmath56 @xcite , and @xmath57 for @xmath58 momenta @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) gev @xcite . following ref .",
    "@xcite , we fix @xmath61% and all other efficiencies to 100% .",
    "lastly , we consider one year of operation .    as for systematics",
    ", we also estimate the errors associated with the mismeasurement of the atomic number of cosmic ray nuclei . using the full capabilities of the ams-02 silicon tracker , the author of ref .",
    "@xcite used monte carlo simulations to estimate the level of misidentifications , finding fewer than one percent for @xmath62 .",
    "conservatively , we take @xmath63% . the @xmath3be/@xmath4be measurement , on the other hand , is more delicate since it relies not only on charge , but also mass separation . from ref .",
    "@xcite , we take a mean mass resolution for be of @xmath64% . requiring a separation of consecutive isotopes within 0.5 atomic mass units , this mass resolution results in misidentification of @xmath4be as @xmath3be and vice - versa less often than @xmath65% .",
    "hence we use a systematic error for @xmath66 given by @xmath67 , and analogously for @xmath68 . clearly , the systematics become unacceptable when either @xmath69 or @xmath70 approaches unity .",
    "finally , for the antiproton - to - proton ratio , the dominant fraction of the systematic error comes from the @xmath58 measurement .",
    "in order to confidently identify antiprotons , the large background of protons and electrons must be rejected with high efficiency . in the multi - gev energy range ,",
    "at which @xmath71 ( @xmath72 )  @xcite , the rejection power expected for ams-02 is @xmath73 ( @xmath74 )  @xcite , leading to a systematic error of order @xmath75% ( @xmath76% ) .",
