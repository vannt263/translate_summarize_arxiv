    "<S> data of pierre auger observatory show a proton - dominated chemical composition of ultrahigh - energy cosmic rays spectrum at ( @xmath0 )  eev and a steadily heavier composition with energy increasing . in order to explain this feature we assume that ( @xmath0 )  eev protons are extragalactic and derive their maximum acceleration energy , @xmath1  eev , compatible with both the spectrum and the composition . </S>",
    "<S> we also assume the rigidity - dependent acceleration mechanism of heavier nuclei , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed model has rather disappointing consequences : i ) no pion photo - production on cmb photons in extragalactic space and hence ii ) no high - energy cosmogenic neutrino fluxes ; iii ) no gzk - cutoff in the spectrum ; iv ) no correlation with nearby sources due to nuclei deflection in the galactic magnetic fields up to highest energies .    </S>",
    "<S> spectra and chemical compositions of ultrahigh - energy ( @xmath3 eev ) cosmic rays ( uhecr ) measured by two largest detectors , high resolution fly s eye ( hires ) @xcite and pierre auger observatory ( pao ) @xcite , are significantly different .    </S>",
    "<S> the hires data show pure _ proton _ composition @xcite , confirming such signatures of their propagation through cmbr as the gzk cutoff @xcite and the pair - production dip @xcite .    the pao data , on the contrary , strongly favor the nuclei composition getting progressively heavier at @xmath4  eev . </S>",
    "<S> this feature , in terms of energy dependence of eas development maximum in atmosphere , @xmath5 , and r.m.s .  of this </S>",
    "<S> observable , rms(@xmath6 ) , is clearly seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] </S>",
    "<S> . the data also suggest that the nucleus charge number @xmath7 changes smoothly in sources .    here </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the simple , but disappointing for future experiments , model @xcite can naturally explain both energy spectrum and mass composition observed by the pao .    </S>",
    "<S> the basic assumption of the model is the _ proton composition _ of uhecr spectrum at @xmath8  eev , the feature supported both by pao and hires . </S>",
    "<S> two more assumptions are that these protons are _ extragalactic _ and that acceleration of primary nuclei in sources is _ rigidity - dependent _ , </S>",
    "<S> i.e.  that @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a universal energy to be determined from data ; @xmath7 is a nucleus charge number .    </S>",
    "<S> in order to determine the maximum acceleration energy of protons , @xmath11 , let us calculate the extragalactic diffuse proton flux , assuming the power - law generation spectrum @xmath12 with @xmath13 , and normalize it by the pao flux at ( @xmath0 )  eev . varying @xmath14 in the range @xmath15 , the maximum value of @xmath10 allowed by the pao mass composition ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ) and energy spectrum ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) may be obtained .    in our calculations a homogeneous distribution of sources with no cosmological evolution ( @xmath16 ) was assumed ; the highest redshift of sources @xmath17 . as a criterion of contradiction an excess of calculated proton flux at @xmath18  eev was chosen . </S>",
    "<S> the contradiction has different character for different values of @xmath14 .    for steep source generation functions with @xmath19 the shape and flux of the pao spectrum </S>",
    "<S> may be described by @xmath20  ev ; the contradiction occurs only in data on mass composition . </S>",
    "<S> the extreme case , given by @xmath21 , is displayed in the left panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] .    for flat generation spectra </S>",
    "<S> ( see the extreme case of @xmath22 in the right panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ) the contradiction is very pronounced . for @xmath23  </S>",
    "<S> eev the calculated proton flux exceeds the observed one even at @xmath24  eev .    </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that with some redundancy @xmath25  eev for all @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> an influence of possible intergalactic magnetic fields on proton spectrum calculated in a diffusive model is shown in the left panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath27 , which might be the case for acceleration by relativistic shocks . the kolmogorov diffusion in turbulent magnetic field with basic scales </S>",
    "<S> @xmath28 was assumed ( see @xcite ) and distances between sources were @xmath29  mpc . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of proton maximum energy of acceleration gives again @xmath30  eev , in a rough agreement with the analysis made for homogeneous distribution of sources . </S>",
    "<S> the account for diffusion brings to the flattening of the proton spectrum at @xmath31  eev , seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] as a diffusive cutoff , which provides a transition from the steep galactic spectrum , most probably composed of iron , to the flat spectrum of extragalactic protons .    </S>",
    "<S> the basic feature of the pao mass composition , the progressively heavier composition with energy increasing , is guaranteed in our model by the rigidity - dependent maximum energy of acceleration : at energy higher than @xmath32 nuclei with charge @xmath33 disappear , while heavier nuclei with larger @xmath7 survive . </S>",
    "<S> starting from @xmath34  eev , the higher energies are accessible only for nuclei with progressively larger values of @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider a two - component model , with only protons and iron nuclei being produced in sources with generation index @xmath22 and the maximum acceleration energy @xmath35  eev , shown in the right panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the primary iron nuclei spectrum is calculated as in @xcite for homogeneous distribution of sources . </S>",
    "<S> one may notice that the calculated spectrum of iron describes well the cutoff in the pao spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> this steepening is caused by the photo - disintegration of iron nuclei .    </S>",
    "<S> to agree with the mass composition of pao , the iron spectrum in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] must have a low - energy cutoff at @xmath36  eev . </S>",
    "<S> most naturally it is produced as a diffusive cutoff which appears in models with lattice - located sources due to _ magnetic horizon _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such cutoffs are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig6 ] for three different sets of parameters @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the beginning of this cutoff @xmath38 for iron nuclei is @xmath39 times higher than for protons , i.e.  @xmath40  ev , which has a reasonable physical meaning . </S>",
    "<S> the gap between @xmath41  eev and @xmath42  eev is expected to be filled by intermediate nuclei . to provide a smooth rms(@xmath6 ) curve seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , there are many free parameters , e.g.  arbitrary fractions of nuclei accelerated in distant sources .    with the proton composition ( the 6th low - energy bin of the pao data in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> if this energy increases , @xmath43 increases , too . </S>",
    "<S> the model collapses when the allowed @xmath43 reaches e.g.  ( @xmath44 )  eev .    </S>",
    "<S> another case is given by the mass composition beinglight nuclei starting right from 1  eev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmological evolution of sources are not included in our calculations ; since this effect slightly decreases @xmath45 , it is not needed to be taken into account . in principle , it is also possible that the eev protons detected by pao are secondary ones , i.e.  those produced in photo - dissociation of primary nuclei in collisions with cmbr and extragalactic ir / uv photons . </S>",
    "<S> however , in fact , as it was demonstrated in @xcite , the flux of secondary protons in the eev range is always smaller than the sum of primary and secondary nuclei fluxes .    </S>",
    "<S> the predictions of our model are very disappointing for the future detectors . </S>",
    "<S> really , the maximum acceleration energy @xmath46 eev for iron nuclei implies the energy per nucleon @xmath47 , well below the gzk cutoff for epochs with @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , practically no cosmogenic neutrinos can be produced in collisions of protons and nuclei with cmb photons . </S>",
    "<S> correlation with uhecr sources also is absent due to deflection of nuclei in the galactic magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of correlation in the model is strengthened by the dependence of the maximum energy on @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> the signatures of the disappointing model for the pao detector are the mass - energy relation , already seen in the elongation curve @xmath5 , and transition from galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays below the characteristic energy @xmath49  eev .    </S>",
    "<S> there are some uncertainties in the model presented above . </S>",
    "<S> the most important one relates to estimates of @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> it is determined by the lowest energy where pao data become inconsistent    the work of a. gazizov was supported by a contract with gran sasso center for astroparticle physics ( cfa ) funded by european union and regione abruzzo under the contract p.o . </S>",
