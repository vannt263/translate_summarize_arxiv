    "the blue compact galaxy ( bcg ) i  zw  18 ( mrk 116 ) has been an intensively studied object for the last three decades since the first spectroscopic observations by zwicky ( 1966 ) .",
    "i  zw  18 shows an intense and recent burst of star formation which makes this galaxy an attractive target for studies of star formation history .",
    "recent observations revealed , for example , two stellar populations in i  zw  18 : 1020 myr red supergiants and 0.15 gyr asymptotic giant branch stars ( stlin 2000 ) .    amongst bcgs , i  zw  18 shows the lowest oxygen abundance  : the northwest ( nw ) and the southeast ( se ) bright regions yield log ( o / h ) @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively ( izotov et al . 1999 ) . relative to solar values , one finds [ o / h ] = @xmath8 -   \\log [ n({\\rm x})/n({\\rm h})]_\\odot$ ] , and solar abundances from grevesse et al .",

    "obtained log ( ar / h ) @xmath12 ( nw ) and a slightly lower ratio for the se region , log ( ar / h ) = @xmath13 .",
    "silicon abundances measured by izotov & thuan ( 1999 ) give log ( si / h ) @xmath14 ( nw ) and log ( si / h ) @xmath15 ( se ) . thus , these values imply for the nw emission patch [ ar / h ] = @xmath16 and [ si / h ] = @xmath17 .    the neutral gas properties in i  zw  18 have been probed in both the radio ( see van zee et al .",
    "1998 and references cited therein ) and the uv range ( kunth et al . 1994 ; pettini & lipman 1995 ; vidal - madjar et al .",
    "high velocity and high spatial resolution radio observations have shown that the overall kinematics of the gas associated with i  zw  18 is very complex and the neutral gas velocity dispersion @xmath18 equals @xmath19 km  s@xmath20 , or @xmath21 km  s@xmath20 ( van zee et al . 1998 ) . the column density in front of i  zw  18 deduced from the ly@xmath0 absorption profile by kunth et al . , @xmath22 @xmath5 , is comparable to the peak surface density found by van zee et al . , @xmath23 @xmath5 .",
    "this means that the neutral gas in i  zw  18 can be considered as a local damped ly@xmath0 system ( dla ) which is similar to high redshift dlas observed in the light of background quasars .",
    "first measurement of the o / h abundance in the region have indicated a possible discrepancy between the metal content in the neutral gas and in the regions ( kunth et al .",
    "this , however , was not confirmed in later studies by pettini & lipman ( 1995 ) and by van zee et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who have shown that both the neutral and ionized gas in i  zw  18 may have the same oxygen abundance .",
    "new observations carried out with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( _ fuse _ ) by vidal - madjar et al . ( 2000 ) produce a similar puzzle  : the column density ratio deduced from the @xmath1 and @xmath2 lines in the neutral gas , log  ( ar / si ) @xmath24 , differs significantly from that observed in the regions , log  ( ar / si)@xmath25 and log  ( ar / si)@xmath26 ( izotov et al . 2000 ) .",
    "izotov et al .",
    "suggested that ionization in dlas may affect abundance ratios . to interpret the observations , they suggested a model consisting of two regions with _ substantially different _ metal contents , i.e. implicitly recalling an idea of the existence of two media in bcgs ( a pristine gas , unprocessed since the big bang and a gas polluted by nucleosynthetic products  kunth & sargent 1986 ) .",
    "in general , the discovery of such a primordial gas would be of great importance for cosmology , as noted by kunth et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .    in this letter",
    ", we report on the study of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 profiles of i  zw  18 published by vidal - madjar et al .",
    "we show that these lines can be modeled under the assumption that the metal content in the neutral gas is the same as in the regions without refering to an ionization correction .",
    "spectroscopic observations of i  zw  18 with _ fuse _ in the range @xmath27  are described in detail by vidal - madjar et al .",
    "the spectrum was obtained with a resolution of about @xmath28 and a signal - to - noise ratio of s / n @xmath29 per resolution element . the large entrance aperture ( @xmath30 )",
    "fully covers the galactic surface ( @xmath31 ) . as noted by vidal - madjar et al . ,",
    "_ fuse _ produces the average absorption over the full body of the galaxy . in this case",
    "the analysis of saturated absorption lines is not an easy and unambiguous task .",
    "the main difficulty is connected with the line broadening by large - scale irregular ( stochastic ) velocity fields .",
    "the influence of the finite correlation length on the line profile depends on the details of the observation .",
    "if one considers the line formation process in the light of a point source , then the observed spectrum reflects only one realization of the velocity field and , hence , large deviations from the expectation value of the intensity @xmath32 may occur if the correlation length of the velocity field @xmath33 is not very small compared to the size of the absorbing region ( levshakov & kegel 1997 ) .",
    "if , however , the spectrograph aperture covers an essential part of the galactic surface , then @xmath32 should reasonably well correspond to the observations .",
    "but also in this case the standard voigt - fitting analysis ( based on the assumption of microturbulence ) may yield misleading results ( levshakov & kegel 1994 ) .",
    "below we demonstrate this effect using the published _ fuse _ data .",
    "we begin with the standard voigt - fitting analysis which assumes a completely uncorrelated velocity field , i.e. @xmath34 ( _ microturbulence _ ) . in our example",
    "we use the published data from fig .",

    "both profiles were centered at @xmath36 km  s@xmath20 according to the synthetic spectra of vidal - madjar et al . , and the internal uncertainty of our velocity scale calibration was estimated to be about @xmath37 km  s@xmath20 .",

    ", we firstly fitted two component voigt profiles to the observed intensities via @xmath44 minimization . in this procedure",
    "the theoretical profiles were convolved with the instrumental point - spread function which is supposed to be a gaussian with the width of 26 km  s@xmath20 .",

    "both lines are still close to the linear part of the curve of growth , while in the mesoturbulent regime they lie on the flat part .",
