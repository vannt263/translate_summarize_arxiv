    "it lies at the heart of modern applications such as quantum control and quantum information processing as well as constitutes the foundation for fundamental studies of quantum mechanics .",
    "coherent manipulation of two - level systems can be achieved and optimized by introducing external fields , e.g. , the most commonly used types of periodic@xcite and pulse - shaped@xcite driving fields . in the past few decades , the two - level quantum system ( or a qubit ) involving single and/or combined modulations has proven a fertile ground for a variety of intriguing phenomena , including self - induced transparency@xcite , complete population inversion ( cpi)@xcite , dynamical stabilization@xcite , and coherent destruction of tunneling ( cdt)@xcite , to name only a few",

    "unfortunately , it is usually extremely difficult to acquire exactly soluble two - level evolutions so far .",
    "started with the famous examples like the landau - zener model@xcite , rabi problem@xcite , rose - zener model@xcite , the problems of finding analytic solutions of driven tlss have been underway for a long time@xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , most of the known exact solutions of tlss are expressed in terms of complicated special functions , such as the gauss hypergeometric function@xcite , weber function@xcite , associated legendre function@xcite , jacobi elliptic function@xcite , and heun function@xcite . up to now , only a very few examples of analytically solvable two - level evolutions described only by several of the simplest solutions@xcite , which renders the control strategies more transparent , have been reported .    in recent years ,",
    "parity - time ( @xmath0)-symmetric two - level system have attracted much attention from both theoretical and experimental studies@xcite . a surprising",
    "finding of such @xmath0-symmetric non - hermitian hamiltonian systems is phase transition , where the spectrum changes from all real to complex when the gain - loss parameter exceeds a certain threshold .",
    "it has been widely demonstrated that external driving fields can be effectively used for implementing coherent controls of @xmath0symmetry , and extension of driven two - level systems to non - hermitian case is currently of broad interest@xcite-@xcite .",
    "for the proper control of the @xmath0-symmetric two - level system , different analytic methods are required .",

    "the exact analytical solutions of simple forms enables us to precisely produce complete population inversion ( cpi ) between two states in @xmath0-symmetric systems . the pulse area theorem for such cpi",

    "the central purpose of this article is to develop analytical approaches to the design of coherent control of @xmath0-symmetric two - level systems by constructing exact solutions of simple forms through synchronous combined modulations .",

    "we focus on how to design simple synchronous combined modulations to give analytic demonstrations of some intriguing and unexpected physics of non - hermitian two - level systems . here",
    "synchronous modulations means that the driving terms @xmath10 and @xmath11 have the same time dependence , in other words , the modulation functions @xmath10 and @xmath9 satisfy the relation @xmath12 with @xmath13 being a proportional constant .",

( 2 ) for the nonzero constant modulation ( @xmath40 ) , the solution does not have to be bounded .",

    "it should be emphasised that for @xmath39 , the general solution ( [ s11])-([s33 ] ) itself is also a kind of floquet state with a zero quasienergy , due to the fact that any linear combination of two degenerate floquet eigenstates ( the coefficients of linear combination @xmath61 are adjusted by the initial condition ) is also a floquet eigenstate of the hamiltonian operator corresponding to the same eigenvalue ( quasienergy ) .     for the system ( [ eq1 ] ) subject to a periodic modulation ( [ pm1 ] ) with ( a)-(b ) @xmath41 ( upper row ) and ( c)-(d ) @xmath39 ( lower row ) .",

    "the cdt is connected to the degeneracy of the quasienergies .",
    "in fact , cdt requires in addition that the degenerate floquet states do not show appreciable amplitude oscillations within one oscillation cycle , which can be realized in the high frequency limit ( @xmath65 ) .",

    "[ fig3](a ) for different values of driving frequencies . for the low - frequency driving , the occupation of level @xmath3 oscillates and at certain times drops to zero , indicating no suppression of tunneling .",
    "as the driving frequency @xmath68 is increased , the degree of localization is enhanced and the amplitude of oscillations of @xmath70 is smaller .",
    "if @xmath68 is increased further , @xmath70 remains near unity and the tunneling dynamics is frozen , which is a direct signature of cdt . to quantify the stable but non - unitary dynamics more precisely ,",
    "we have used localization , which is defined as the minimum value of @xmath67 , to measure the suppression of tunneling .",
    "when cdt occurs , the localization is close to 1 ; when there is no suppression , localization is zero . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) we plot the minimum value of @xmath67 , or the localization , as a function of the driving frequency . for small values of @xmath68 ,",
    "the minimum value of @xmath67 equals zero , and thus no cdt occurs . as @xmath68 is increased , however , the localization is close to one , and the oscillations in @xmath70 are quenched , producing cdt .",

    "[ fig3](c ) and ( d ) , where with the increase of @xmath13 the amplitude of oscillations of @xmath70 is larger and the localization is decreased accordingly .",

    "this is in full analogy to the hermitian case .",
    "we now consider the synchronous modulation of a square sech - shaped ( a pulse - shaped ) form .",
    "let @xmath72 such that the new time variable becomes @xmath73 when @xmath74 ( hence @xmath75 ) , the system ( [ eq1 ] ) reduces to the famous rose - zener model without detuning@xcite .",
    "we first briefly overview the main results of the rose - zener model on resonance .",
    "therein the transition probability is given as @xmath76 here @xmath77 is the area of pulse .",
    "obviously , if the pulse area satisfies @xmath78 , this transition probability vanishes and the system completely returns its original state , while if @xmath79 , this pulse produces complete population inversion ( cpi ) between two states . note that the definition of pulse area used here differs by a factor 2 from the common usage in the literatures@xcite .",
    "surprisingly , we find that there still exist cpi in the driven non - hermitian ( @xmath0-symmetric ) two - level system . hence ,",
    "below we shall discuss non - hermitian generalization of cpi and formulate the pulse area theorem for such cpi based on the exact solutions ( [ s11])-([s33 ] ) .",

    "clearly , a complete population inversion ( cpi ) has been fully confirmed by our numerical simulations .",
    "in summary , we have presented a class of exact analytical solutions for a @xmath0-symmetric two - level system under synchronous combined modulations .",
    "such exact solutions are expressible in terms of simple elementary functions and are applicable in the coherent control of quantum states . with these analytical solutions , we have demonstrated that for a cosine synchronous driving with a nonzero static component , the system behaves likes the undriven one with a phase transition from full to broken @xmath0 symmetry , while for a purely cosine synchronous driving , the system , although being non - hermitian , feature all - real quasienergy spectra for the whole range of tuning parameters .",

    "<S> we propose a simple method of combined synchronous modulations to generate the analytically exact solutions for a parity - time symmetric two - level system . </S>",
    "<S> such exact solutions are expressible in terms of simple elementary functions and helpful for illuminating some generalizations of appealing concepts originating in the hermitian system . some intriguing physical phenomena , such as stabilization of a non - hermitian system by periodic driving , non - hermitian analogs of coherent destruction of tunneling ( cdt ) and complete population inversion ( cpi ) , are demonstrated analytically and confirmed numerically . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , by using these exact solutions we derive a pulse area theorem for such non - hermitian cpi in the parity - time symmetric two - level system . </S>",
    "<S> our results may provide an additional possibility for pulse manipulation and coherent control of the parity - time symmetric two - level system . </S>"
