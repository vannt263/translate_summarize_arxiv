    "intrinsic random functions  @xcite provide a popular class of models for spatial processes .",
    "these non - stationary random processes are specified by their generalized covariance functions , which determine the variances of certain linear combinations of the process ( see section  [ sec2.1 ] for details ) . a particularly simple and , therefore , useful class of generalized covariance functions is the power law class , for which the `` covariance '' between two observations is proportional to the euclidean distance between the points raised to some power ( unless the power is an even integer ) .",
    "more specifically , for @xmath0 indicating interpoint distance , @xmath1 and @xmath2 the set of positive integers , the function @xmath3 @xmath4 gives a valid generalized covariance function in any number of dimensions . despite its simplicity , this class of models has the important virtue of admitting a broad range of local behaviors for the process , which is critical when , for example , considering properties of spatial interpolants  @xcite . specifically , the larger the value of @xmath5 , the smoother the process , so that , for example , the process is @xmath6 times mean square differentiable in any direction if and only if @xmath7 . a generalized covariance function can be written as the fourier transform of a positive measure ; although , in contrast to the stationary setting , the measure might not have finite total mass .",
    "in particular , in  @xmath8 dimensions , the measure corresponding to @xmath3 has density with respect to lebesgue measure proportional to @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the spatial frequency .",
    "the goal of this paper is to find a good extension of @xmath3 to the space  time setting .",
    "the problem is made difficult by what i will mean by `` good . ''",
    "the first requirement is that the class of models includes members allowing any degree of smoothness in space and any ( possibly different ) degree of smoothness in time .",
    "specifically , for @xmath11 a generalized covariance function of spatial lag @xmath12 and temporal lag @xmath13 , and any positive @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the class of generalized covariance functions should include a member that satisfies @xmath16 and @xmath17 or , failing that , that ( [ coord1 ] ) holds asymptotically as @xmath18 , and ( [ coord2 ] ) holds asymptotically as @xmath19 .",
    "the second requirement is that @xmath20 be smoother away from the origin than it is at the origin .",
    "this requirement is needed to avoid the kinds of anomalies described in @xcite for covariance functions that are not smoother away from the origin . as a simple example of this kind of anomaly ,",
    "consider the covariance function on @xmath21 given by @xmath22 .",
    "write corr for correlation , and define @xmath23",
    ". then for @xmath24 , straightforward calculations show @xmath25 for @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the discontinuity in this limiting correlation is due to the fact that @xmath28 has a similar discontinuity in its first derivative in the @xmath13 direction everywhere along the @xmath29 axis as it does at the origin .",
    "i consider such a discontinuity in @xmath30 as unrealistic for most natural space",
    " time processes .",
    "in particular , stein and handcock @xcite and stein  @xcite give examples showing how this lack of continuity away from the origin can lead to optimal ( kriging ) predictors with undesirable properties .",
    "all separable space ",
    "time covariance functions , that is , those that factor into a function of space and a function of time such as @xmath31 , have a similar problem unless the process is infinitely differentiable  @xcite , page  311 . furthermore , many non - separable space  time covariance functions proposed in the literature share this problem  @xcite , pages  311312 . for a space",
    " time covariance function with different degrees of smoothness in space and time , that is , satisfying ( [ coord1 ] ) and ( [ coord2 ] ) with @xmath32 , it is not so clear what one should mean by the function being smoother away from the origin than at the origin .",
    "this issue is addressed in section  [ sec2.4 ] .",
    "the smoothness of a covariance function away from the origin is closely related to regularity properties of the corresponding spectral density at high frequencies  @xcite .",
    "indeed , stein  @xcite argues that the spectral domain provides a more natural approach for considering the appropriateness of various models for space  time covariance functions .",
    "specifically ,  @xcite gives the following condition as a plausible requirement for the spectral density @xmath33 of a natural process in space or space  time : for every @xmath34 , @xmath35 that is , @xmath36 changes slowly ( on a relative scale ) at high frequencies .",
    "this condition excludes , for example , separable space  time models .",
    "the third and final requirement for the generalized covariance functions is that they can be computed accurately and efficiently via , for example , series expansions , to allow them to be applied routinely to large space",
    " time datasets .",
    "in particular , representations of the function as an integral will not be considered an adequate solution to the problem .",
    "as best as i am aware , no existing class of generalized covariance functions satisfies all three of these requirements .",
    "it will be convenient to avoid explicitly distinguishing between space and time and consider processes @xmath37 on @xmath38 for positive integers @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "stein  @xcite proposed the following class of spectral densities ( with a different parameterization ) as a flexible parametric model for stationary space ",
    "time processes : @xmath41 for @xmath42 positive , @xmath43 and @xmath44 ; this last condition being necessary and sufficient ( given the positivity constraints on the other parameters ) for @xmath45 to be integrable .",
    "the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 are inverse range parameters , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are scale parameters and @xmath50 and @xmath51 together describe the smoothness of the process in @xmath12 and @xmath52 .",
    "more specifically , the process is @xmath53 times mean square differentiable in each component of @xmath12 if and only if @xmath54 and , similarly , is @xmath53 times mean square differentiable in components of @xmath52 if and only if @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath56 and @xmath57 are integers , the resulting covariance function is infinitely differentiable away from the origin ( @xcite , proposition  4 , although this result also follows from @xcite , theorem 1.1 ) .",
    "all models in the class ( [ model1 ] ) satisfy the spectral condition ( [ f - cond ] ) .",
    "porcu  @xcite describes more general approaches to obtaining valid spectral densities that could be useful in the space  time context .",
    "an obstacle to using the class of models ( [ model1 ] ) is the lack of an explicit expression for the corresponding covariance functions . except when @xmath58 and some special cases with @xmath51 an integer , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , i am unaware of any cases for which an explicit expression has been written down  @xcite . for rational spectral densities , which includes the model ( [ model1 ] ) when",
    "@xmath50 and  @xmath51 are all integers as a special case , the covariance function can be expressed as the solution of a certain set of equations that reduce to a partial differential equation when the rational function is just a reciprocal of a polynomial  @xcite . however , writing down an explicit solution for all integers @xmath50 and @xmath51 is not a simple task .",
    "ma  @xcite gives explicit expressions for the covariance functions of space ",
    "time processes with rational spectral densities in some limited special cases that do not include any instances of ( [ model1 ] ) . for all of the cases treated in  @xcite ,",
    "the covariance functions are not smoother away from the origin than at the origin in the sense defined in section  [ sec2.3 ] , and the spectral densities do not satisfy ( [ f - cond ] ) . even if one had explicit expressions for the covariance functions of all rational spectral densities , these covariance functions ( asymptotically in a neighborhood of the origin ) satisfy ( [ coord1 ] ) and ( [ coord2 ] ) only for a countable nowhere dense set of @xmath61 values .",
    "kelbert , leonenko and ruiz - medina  @xcite consider the case @xmath62 and @xmath63 as a stochastic fractional heat equation in some detail , but they only give integral representations for the covariance functions .",
    "they consider additionally setting @xmath64 and note that the resulting random field has a self - similarity property when @xmath65 .",
    "christakos  @xcite , page  225 , mentions the case with @xmath66 and @xmath63 as a possible model for spatial - temporal processes , but derives no results for these models .    the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 are range parameters that do not affect the local behavior of the process ,",
    "so consider setting @xmath67 in ( [ model1 ] ) , yielding @xmath68 these spectral densities are not integrable in a neighborhood of the origin , so they correspond to generalized covariance functions .",
    "section  [ sec2.1 ] gives some background on generalized covariance functions .",
    "theorem  [ gtheorem ] in section  [ sec2.2 ] gives a convergent power series for the generalized covariance function corresponding to ( [ model2 ] ) when @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 and separate explicit formulae to cover the case @xmath72 .",
    "for completeness , the known result  @xcite for the generalized covariance function when @xmath59 is also given in theorem  [ gtheorem ] .",
    "section  [ sec2.3 ] shows how the generalized covariance functions in theorem [ gtheorem ] can , in most cases , be written in terms of the @xmath73-function  @xcite , a generalization of the generalized hypergeometric function that is sometimes called fox s",

    "furthermore , in a sense made precise in section  [ sec2.4 ] , the resulting generalized covariance function is shown to be smoother away from the origin than at the origin .",
    "finally , these results are used to show that at least some of these covariance functions avoid what  @xcite calls the `` dimple '' that occurs in some proposed space ",
    "time covariance functions , which is a lack of monotonicity in the correlation structure that might often be viewed as unnatural .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] discusses some limitations and possible extensions of the generalized covariance functions considered in section  [ sec2 ] .",

    "as noted in  @xcite , perhaps  @xcite comes closest to this goal , in that this paper gives a class of models with @xmath78 including elements satisfying , asymptotically in a neighborhood of the origin , ( [ coord1 ] ) with @xmath79 and ( [ coord2 ] ) with @xmath80 , and the covariance functions are infinitely differentiable away from the origin .",

    "finding covariance function models for space ",
    "time processes that allow for a different degree of smoothness in space and in time , possess certain other desirable properties such as ( [ f - cond ] ) and are accurately computable using series expansions is a major challenge .",
