    "recently , it is discovered that a heavy fermion ( hf ) state is realized in @xmath0 , a transition - metal oxide with a cubic spinel structure.@xcite it has the largest specific heat coefficient among @xmath2-electron systems , @xmath3.@xcite the origin of the hf behavior without almost localized @xmath4-electrons is still an important open issue .",
    "ab initio band calculations suggest that geometrical frustration of the spinel structure in which v sites form corner - sharing tetrahedra network(so - called pyrochlore lattice ) may be important.@xcite actually , it is known that some geometrically frustrated electron systems in the vicinity of the mott transition shows a hf behavior.@xcite however , since the electron density of @xmath0 is quarter - filling , the above idea may not be directly applicable to this system .",
    "nevertheless , it is expected that the geometrical frustration plays some crucial role . on the other hand , anisimov et al .",

    "1 . some portions of one - dimensional - like bands formed by @xmath5 orbital on the pyrochlore lattice .    here",
    ", we would like to propose another microscopic model for the hf state from a quite different point of view .",
    "we pay attention to the fact that as was shown by band calculations , electrons near the fermi surface consist mainly of the @xmath5 orbitals of v ion which is quarter - filled , and that the hybridization with @xmath6-electrons of oxygen is small.@xcite we will neglect trigonal field splitting , since it is smaller than the band width by @xmath7.@xcite then we can see that each @xmath5 orbital on the corners of the pyrochlore lattice forms one - dimensional ( 1d ) like bands along each edge of tetrahedra ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "it is expected that the hybridization between these 1d bands is much suppressed by the geometrical configuration . in other words",
    ", we can say that to reduce the geometrical frustration the electronic structure maintains the 1d - like character .",
    "actually , the band structure obtained from this consideration resembles qualitatively that of ab initio calculations.@xcite this proposal is also supported by the following experimental observations .",
    "( i ) recent neutron scattering measurements shows that there exists antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation with a staggered wave vector @xmath8.@xcite this @xmath9 vector is close to that of the quarter - filled 1d hubbard model .",

    "6 ) ( ii ) as temperature is raised , the resistivity increases monotonically like @xmath12 for @xmath13 , and is not saturated in contrast to @xmath4-electron - based hf systems.@xcite here @xmath14 is the characteristic temperature which is analogous to the kondo temperature of @xmath4-electron - based hf systems . the behavior is easily understood , if we identify @xmath14 with a dimensional crossover temperature .",
    "namely , @xmath14 is regarded as a crossover temperature from 1d to 3d . for @xmath13 ,",
    "the 1d - like electronic structure gives rise @xmath15-linear resistivity.@xcite ( iii ) moreover , the hall coefficient measured by urano et al .",
    "is much small for @xmath13.@xcite since there exist several fermi surfaces in this system , it is rather difficult to calculate the hall coefficient from a microscopic model .",
    "however , this experimental fact does not contradict with the interpretation that for @xmath13 the system has 1d - like character .",
    "we show schematically the temperature dependence of the hall coefficient and the resistivity of our model in fig.2 . it is noted that these properties are not changed qualitatively even if the sample is not a single crystal , as in the case of some experimental situations .    based upon these considerations ,",
    "we construct the network of quarter - filled hubbard chains in directions @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , which is defined on the corner - sharing tetrahedra .",
    "we assume that the chains are coupled weakly with each other at the corners of tetrahedra .",
    "because of 1d - like structure , electron correlation effect is much enhanced , leading to the large specific heat coefficient . in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate this scenario by microscopic calculation .",
    "we show that the temperature dependence of the spin susceptibility calculated from our model is consistent with experimental observations , and that the specific heat coefficient is enhanced like @xmath1 .",
    "a similar idea has been recently proposed by fulde et al . who considered a network of 1d heisenberg spin chains with spins @xmath19 and @xmath20.@xcite however since @xmath0 is metallic , we believe that our model is more appropriate to discuss the hf state of this system .",

    "the sign of @xmath22 for @xmath24 depends on the curvature of the 3d fermi surface formed in the low energy scale .",
    "based on the consideration presented in the introduction , we construct the hamiltonian of our model in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath25 , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the hamiltonian of the 1d hubbard model , @xmath28 @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) is an annihilation ( creation ) operator for electrons on @xmath31 chains , and @xmath32 .",

    "however , in @xmath0 , it is possible that the hybridization between different chains realizes through @xmath6-electrons of oxygen .",
    "actually the hybridization between the chains should be non - local .",
    "this non - locality makes the model quite complicated .",
    "thus for simplicity , we assume that each hubbard chains hybridizes at each corner of a tetrahedron . the hybridization parameter @xmath43 is given by , @xmath44 then the hybridization gives rise the doubling of 1d bands generating total 12 bands because of the geometrical structure of a tetrahedron . in spite of this simplification of the hybridization parameter ,",

    "we use this parameter in the following calculations .",
    "the issue of dimensional crossover from 1d to 3d has been studied extensively so far.@xcite the basic idea of these previous works is to expand the free energy in terms of inter - chain couplings , and to apply landau - ginzburg type arguments . to avoid confusion",
    ", we would like to stress that our system is not an assembly of parallel chains as was considered in the previous studies , but a network composed of chains aligned in six different directions reflecting the topology of tetrahedra .",

    "it is noted that in the denominator of eq.([spinsus ] ) the single - particle green s function @xmath101 appears .",
    "eq.([spinsus ] ) implies that as the quasiparticle weight develops , the spin - spin correlation between hubbard chains which is mediated by two particle hopping is enhanced .",
    "this point is important for the following arguments . although we know the low energy expression of @xmath102 , it is difficult to carry out the fourier transform analytically.@xcite for simplicity , we approximate the anomalous exponent of @xmath102 as @xmath103 . actually @xmath104 is sufficiently small for intermediate strength of @xmath105 , _",

    "to fit to experimental data , we set the van vleck term @xmath123 .",
    "it is noted that the curie - like temperature dependence is not due to the presence of local moment as in the case of dense kondo systems , but caused by the development of 3d - like magnetic correlation between hubbard chains . as temperature decreases ,",

    "let us consider the specific heat coefficient which characterizes the hf behavior . according to eq.([partf ] ) , the free energy is given by the sum of the 1d part and the fermi liquid part .",
    "thus the specific heat coefficient is expressed as , @xmath124 .",
    "it should be noted that this expression is valid only around the crossover temperature @xmath14 , since in the sufficiently low temperature region the higher order terms of @xmath70 which are neglected in our approximation will cancel the 1d - like contribution , and the conventional fermi liquid result must be recovered .",
    "thus , @xmath125 in the low temperature region where the system is in the 3d fermi liquid state .",
    "we calculate the fermi liquid part @xmath126 taking into account contributions from spin fluctuations .",
    "since in the 1d hubbard model the staggered component of the spin fluctuation is dominant over the uniform one , the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation gives leading corrections to the self - energy .",
