    "one of the mathematical challenges encountered in the study of systems exhibiting phase coexistence is an efficient description of microscopic phase boundaries . here",
    "various levels of detail are in general possible : the finest level is typically associated with a statistical - mechanical model ( e.g. , a lattice gas ) in which both the interface and the surrounding phases are represented microscopically ; at the coarsest level the interface is viewed as a macroscopic ( geometrical ) surface between two structureless bulk phases .",
    "an intermediate approach is based on effective ( and , often , solid - on - solid ) models , in which the interface is still microscopic  represented by a stochastic field  while the structural details of the bulk phases are neglected .",
    "a simple example of such an effective model is a _",
    "gradient field_. to define this system , we consider a finite subset  @xmath12 of the @xmath13-dimensional hypercubic lattice  @xmath14 and , at each site of  @xmath12 and its external boundary  @xmath15 , we consider the real - valued variable  @xmath16 representing the height of the interface at  @xmath17 .",
    "the hamiltonian is then given by @xmath18 where the sum is over unordered nearest - neighbor pairs @xmath19 .",
    "a standard example is the quadratic potential  @xmath20 with  @xmath21 ; in general  @xmath5 is assumed to be a smooth , even function with a sufficient ( say , quadratic ) growth at infinity .",
    "the gibbs measure takes the usual form @xmath22 where  @xmath23 is the @xmath24-dimensional lebesgue measure ( the boundary values of  @xmath25 remain fixed and implicit in the notation ) , @xmath6 is the inverse temperature and  @xmath26 is a normalization constant .",
    "a natural question to ask is what are the possible limits of the gibbs measures @xmath27 as  @xmath28 .",
    "unfortunately , in dimensions  @xmath29 , the fields  @xmath30 are very `` rough '' no matter how tempered the boundary conditions are assumed to be . as a consequence , the family of measures  @xmath31 is not tight and no meaningful object is obtained by taking the limit  @xmath28i.e .",
    ", the interface is _",
    "delocalized_. on the other hand , in dimensions  @xmath32 the fields are sufficiently smooth to permit a non - trivial thermodynamic limit  the interface is _",
    "localized_. these facts are established by combinations of brascamp - lieb inequality techniques and/or random walk representation ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) which , unfortunately , apply only for convex potentials with uniformly positive curvature .",
    "thus , somewhat surprisingly , even for @xmath33 the problem of localization in high - dimension is still open  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* open problem  1 ) .",
    "as it turns out , the thermodynamic limit of the measures  @xmath34 is significantly less singular once we restrict attention to the gradient variables @xmath0 .",
    "these are defined by  @xmath35 where  @xmath1 is the nearest - neighbor edge  @xmath36 oriented in one of the positive lattice directions .",
    "indeed , the  @xmath37-marginal of  @xmath27 always has at least one ( weak ) limit `` point '' as  @xmath38 .",
    "the limit measures satisfy a natural dlr condition and are therefore called _ gradient gibbs measures_. ( precise definitions will be stated below or can be found in  @xcite . )",
    "one non - standard aspect of the gradient variables is that they have to obey a host of constraints .",
    "namely , @xmath39 holds for each lattice plaquette  @xmath9 , where the edges  @xmath40 are listed counterclockwise and are assumed to be positively oriented .",
    "these constraints will be implemented at the level of _ a priori _ measure , see sect .",
    "[ s : model ] .",
    "it would be natural to expect that the character ( and number ) of gradient gibbs measures depends sensitively on the potential  @xmath5 . however , this is not the case for the class of uniformly strictly - convex potentials ( i.e. , the  @xmath5 s such that  @xmath41 for all  @xmath37 ) .",
    "indeed , funaki and spohn @xcite showed that , in these cases , the translation - invariant , ergodic , gradient gibbs measures are completely characterized by the _ tilt _ of the underlying interface . here",
    "the tilt is a vector  @xmath42 such that @xmath43 for every edge  @xmath1which we regard as a vector in  @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore , the correspondence is one - to - one , i.e. , for each tilt there exists precisely one gradient gibbs measure with this tilt .",
    "alternative proofs permitting extensions to discrete gradient models have appeared in sheffield s thesis  @xcite .",
    "it is natural to expect that a serious violation of the strict - convexity assumption on  @xmath5 may invalidate the above results .",
    "actually , an example of a gradient model with multiple gradient gibbs states of the same tilt has recently been presented  @xcite ; unfortunately , the example is not of the type considered above because of the lack of translation invariance and its reliance on the discreteness of the fields .",
    "the goal of this paper is to point out a general mechanism by which the model with a sufficiently non - convex potential  @xmath5 fails the conclusions of funaki - spohn s  theorems .",
    "the mechanism driving our example will be the occurrence of a structural surface phase transition . to motivate the forthcoming considerations ,",
    "let us recall that phase transitions typically arise via one of two mechanisms : either due to the breakdown of an internal symmetry , or via an abrupt turnover between energetically and entropically favored states .",
    "the standard examples of systems with these kinds of phase transitions are the ising model and the @xmath45-state potts model with a sufficiently large  @xmath45 , respectively . in the former , at sufficiently low temperatures , there is a spontaneous breaking of the symmetry between the plus and minus spin states ; in the latter , there is a first - order transition at intermediate temperatures between @xmath45  ordered , low - temperature states and a disordered , high - temperature state .",
    "our goal is to come up with a potential  @xmath5 that would mimic one of the above situations . in the present context",
    "an analogue of the ising model appears to be a _",
    "double - well potential _ of the form ,  e.g. , @xmath46 unfortunately , due to the underlying plaquette constraints , the symmetry between the wells can not be completely broken and , even at the level of ground states , the system appears to be disordered .",
    "on  @xmath2 this can be demonstrated explicitly by making a link to the _ ice model _",
    ", which is a special case of the six vertex model  @xcite .",
    "a similar equivalence has been used  @xcite to study a roughening transition in an sos  interface .    to see how the equivalence works exactly ,",
    "note that the ground states of the system are such that all  @xmath37 s equal  @xmath47 .",
    "let us associate a unit flow with each _ dual _ bond whose sign is determined by the value of  @xmath48 for its direct counterpart  @xmath1 .",
    "the plaquette constraint then translates into a _ no - source - no - sink _ condition for this flow .",
    "if we mark the flow by arrows , the dual bonds at each plaquette are constrained to one of six zero - flux arrangements of the six vertex model ; cf  fig .  [ fig1 ] and its caption .",
    "the weights of all zero - flux arrangements are equal ; we thus have the special case corresponding to the ice model .",
    "the ice model can be `` exactly solved ''  @xcite : the ground states have a non - vanishing residual entropy  @xcite and are disordered with infinite correlation length  ( * ? ? ?",
    "8.10.iii ) . however , it is not clear how much of this picture survives to positive temperatures .",
    "the previous discussion shows that it will be probably quite hard to realize a symmetry - breaking transition in the context of the gradient model  .",
    "it is the order - disorder mechanism for phase transitions that seems considerably more promising .",
    "there are two canonical examples of interest : a potential with _ two centered wells _ and a _ triple - well potential _ ; see fig .  [ fig2 ] . both of these lead to a gradient model which features a phase transition , at some intermediate temperature , from states with the  @xmath37 s lying ( mostly ) within the thinner well to states",
    "whose  @xmath37 s fluctuate on the scale of the thicker well(s ) .",
    "our techniques apply equally to these  as well as other similar  cases provided the widths of the wells are sufficiently distinct . notwithstanding , the analysis becomes significantly cleaner if we abandon temperature as our principal parameter ( e.g. , we set  @xmath49 ) and consider potentials  @xmath5 that are simply _ defined _ by @xmath50 here  @xmath51 and  @xmath52 are positive numbers and  @xmath53 is a parameter taking values in  @xmath54 $ ] . for appropriate values of the constants ,",
    "@xmath5 defined this way will have a graph as in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) . to get the graph in part  ( b )",
    ", we would need to consider  @xmath5 s of the form @xmath55 where  @xmath47 are the ( approximate ) locations of the off - center wells .",
    "the idea underlying the expressions and is similar to that of the fortuin - kasteleyn representation of the potts model  @xcite . in the context of continuous - spin models similar to ours",
    ", such representation has fruitfully been used by zahradnk  @xcite .",
    "focusing on , we can interpret the terms on the right - hand side of as two distinct states of each bond .",
    "( we will soon exploit this interpretation in detail . )",
    "the indexing of the coupling constants suggests the names : `` o '' for _ ordered _ and `` d '' for _",
    "it is clear that the extreme values of  @xmath53 ( near zero or near one ) will be dominated by one type of bonds ; what we intend to show is that , for @xmath51 and  @xmath52 sufficiently distinct from each other , the transition between the `` ordered '' and `` disordered '' phases is ( strongly ) first order .",
    "similar conclusions and proofs  albeit more complicated  apply also to the potential  .",
    "however , for clarity of exposition , we will focus on the potential for the rest of the paper ( see , however , sect .",
    "[ sec2.5 ] ) .",
    "in addition , we will also restrict ourselves to two dimensions , even though the majority of our results are valid for all  @xmath56 .",
    "we commence with a precise definition of our model .",
    "most of the work in this paper will be confined to the lattice torus  @xmath57 of  @xmath58 sites in  @xmath2 , so we will start with this particular geometry . choosing the natural positive direction for each lattice axis ,",
    "let  @xmath59 denote the corresponding set of positively oriented edges in  @xmath57 . given a configuration  @xmath60",
    ", we introduce the gradient field  @xmath61 by assigning the variable @xmath35 to each  @xmath62 .",
    "the product lebesgue measure  @xmath63 induces a ( @xmath64-finite ) measure  @xmath65 on the space  @xmath66 via @xmath67 where  @xmath68 denotes the dirac point - mass at zero .",
    "we interpret the measure  @xmath65 as an _ a priori _ measure on _ gradient _ configurations  @xmath69 . since the  @xmath37 s arise as the gradients of the  @xmath25 s it is easy to check that  @xmath65 is entirely supported on the linear subspace @xmath70 of configurations determined by the condition that the sum of signed  @xmath37s  with a positive or negative sign depending on whether the edge is traversed in the positive or negative direction , respectively  vanishes around each closed circuit on  @xmath57 .",
    "( note that , in addition to , the condition includes also loops that wrap around the torus . )",
    "we will refer to such configurations as _ curl - free_.    next we will define gradient gibbs measures on  @xmath57 . for later convenience we will proceed in some more generality than presently needed : let  @xmath71 be a collection of measurable functions @xmath72 and consider the partition function @xmath73 clearly , @xmath74 and , under the condition that  @xmath75 is integrable with respect to the lebesgue measure on  @xmath76 , also  @xmath77 .",
    "we may then define  @xmath78 to be the probability measure on  @xmath79 given by @xmath80 this is the _ gradient gibbs measure _ on  @xmath57 corresponding to the potentials  @xmath81 . in the situations when @xmath82 for all  @xmath1which is the principal case of interest in this paper  we will denote the corresponding gradient gibbs measure on  @xmath57 by  @xmath83 .",
    "it is not surprising that  @xmath78 obeys appropriate dlr equations with respect to all connected @xmath84 containing no topologically non - trivial circuit .",
    "explicitly , if  @xmath85 in  @xmath86 is a curl - free boundary condition , then the conditional law of  @xmath87 given  @xmath85 is @xmath88 here @xmath89 is the conditional probability with respect to the ( tail )  @xmath64-algebra  @xmath90 generated by the fields on @xmath86 , @xmath91 is the partition function in  @xmath12 , and  @xmath92 is the _ a priori _ measure induced by @xmath65 on  @xmath87 given the boundary condition  @xmath85 .    as usual , this property remains valid even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we thus say that a measure on  @xmath93 is an _ infinite - volume gradient gibbs measure _ if it satisfies the dlr equations with respect to the specification in any finite set  @xmath94 .",
    "( as is easy to check  e.g . , by reinterpreting the  @xmath37 s back in terms of the  @xmath25s@xmath92 is independent of the values of  @xmath85 outside any circuit winding around  @xmath12 , and so it is immaterial that it originated from a measure on torus . )",
    "an important aspect of our derivations will be the fact that our potential  @xmath5 takes the specific form , which can be concisely written as @xmath95 where  @xmath96 is the probability measure @xmath97 .",
    "it follows that the gibbs measure  @xmath83 can be regarded as the projection of the _ extended gradient gibbs measure _ , @xmath98 to the @xmath64-algebra generated by the  @xmath37 s . here",
    "@xmath99 is the product of measures  @xmath96 , one for each bond in  @xmath59 . as is easy to check , conditioning on @xmath100 yields the corresponding extension @xmath101 of the finite - volume specification",
    "the result is independent of the  @xmath102 s outside  @xmath12 because , once  @xmath85 is fixed , these have no effect on the configurations  in  @xmath12 .",
    "the main point of introducing the extended measure is that , if conditioned on the  @xmath102 s , the variables  @xmath48 are distributed as gradients of a gaussian field  albeit with a non - translation invariant covariance matrix .",
    "as we will see , the phase transition proved in this paper is manifested by a jump - discontinuity in the density of bonds with  @xmath103 which at the level of  @xmath37-marginal results in a jump in the characteristic scale of the fluctuations .",
    "notably , the extended measure  @xmath104 plays the same role for  @xmath83 as the so called edwards - sokal coupling measure  @xcite does for the potts model .",
    "similarly as for the edwards - sokal measures  @xcite , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the infinite - volume measures on  @xmath37 s and the corresponding infinite - volume extended gradient gibbs measures on  @xmath105 s .",
    "explicitly , if  @xmath93 is an infinite - volume gradient gibbs measure for potential  @xmath5 , then  @xmath106 , defined by ( extending the consistent family of measures of the  form ) @xmath107 is a gibbs measure with respect to the extended specifications @xmath108 . for the situations with only a few distinct values of  @xmath109",
    ", it may be of independent interest to study the properties of the @xmath102-marginal of the extended measure , e.g. , using the techniques of percolation theory .",
    "however , apart from some remarks in sect .  [ sec - diskuse ] , we will not pursue these matters in the present paper .",
    "now we are ready to state our main results . throughout",
    "we will consider the potentials  @xmath5 of the form with  @xmath110 . as a moment s thought reveals",
    ", the model is invariant under the transformation @xmath111 for any fixed  @xmath112 . in particular , without loss of generality , one could assume from the beginning that  @xmath113 and regard  @xmath114 as the sole parameter of the model .",
    "however , we prefer to treat the two terms in on an equal footing , and so we will keep the coupling strengths independent .    given a shift - ergodic gradient gibbs measure , recall that its tilt is the vector  @xmath115 such that holds for each bond .",
    "the principal result of the present paper is the following theorem :    [ t : main ] for each  @xmath116 there exists a constant  @xmath117 and , if @xmath118 a number  @xmath119 such that , for interaction  @xmath5 with  @xmath120 , there are two distinct , infinite - volume , shift - ergodic gradient gibbs measures  @xmath121 and  @xmath122 of zero tilt for which @xmath123 and @xmath124 here  @xmath125 is a constant of order unity .",
    "an inspection of the proof actually reveals that the above bounds are valid for any  @xmath126 satisfying  @xmath127 , where  @xmath128 is a constant of order unity .    as already alluded to , this result is a consequence of the fact that the density of ordered bonds , i.e. , those with  @xmath103 , undergoes a jump at  @xmath120 . on the torus",
    ", we can make the following asymptotic statements :    [ t : torus ] let  @xmath129 denote the fraction of ordered bonds on  @xmath57 , i.e. , @xmath130 for each  @xmath116 there exists  @xmath117 such that the following holds : under the condition  , and for  @xmath131 as in theorem  [ t : main ] , @xmath132 and @xmath133    the present setting actually permits us to determine the value of  @xmath131 via a duality argument .",
    "this is the only result in this paper which is intrinsically two - dimensional ( and intrinsically tied to the form of  @xmath5 ) .",
    "all other conclusions can be extended to  @xmath56 and to more general potentials .",
    "[ t : dual ] let @xmath134 .",
    "if @xmath135 , then  @xmath131 is given by @xmath136    theorem  [ t : torus ] is proved in sect .",
    "[ sec4.2 ] , theorem  [ t : main ] is proved in sect .",
    "[ sec4.3 ] and theorem  [ t : dual ] is proved in sect .",
    "[ sec5.3 ] .",
    "the phase transition described in the above theorems can be interpreted in several ways .",
    "first , in terms of the extended gradient gibbs measures on torus , it clearly corresponds to a transition between a state with nearly all bonds ordered ( @xmath103 ) to a state with nearly all bonds disordered ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "second , looking back at the inequalities ( [ e : ener - bd1][e : ener - bd2 ] ) , most of the  @xmath37 s will be of order at most  @xmath138 in the ordered state while most of them will be of order at least  @xmath139 in the disordered state .",
    "hence , the corresponding ( effective ) interface is significantly rougher at  @xmath140 than it is at  @xmath141 ( both phases are rough according to the standard definition of this term ) and we may thus interpret the above as a kind of _ first - order roughening _ transition that the interface undergoes at  @xmath131 . finally , since the gradient fields in the two states fluctuate on different characteristic scales , the entropy ( and hence the energy ) associated with these states is different ; we can thus view this as a standard energy - entropy transition .",
    "( by the energy we mean the expectation of  @xmath142 ; notably , the expectation of  @xmath143 is the same in both measures ; cf  . )",
    "energy - entropy transitions for spin models have been studied in  @xcite and , quite recently , in  @xcite .",
    "next let us turn our attention to the conclusions of theorem  [ t : torus ] .",
    "we actually believe that the dichotomy ( [ below - pt][above - pt ] ) applies ( in the sense of almost - sure limit of  @xmath129 as  @xmath144 ) to all translation - invariant extended gradient gibbs states with zero tilt .",
    "the reason is that , conditional on the  @xmath102 s , the gradient fields are gaussian with uniformly positive stiffness .",
    "we rest assured that the techniques of  @xcite and  @xcite can be used to prove that the gradient gibbs measure with zero tilt is unique for almost every configuration of the  @xmath102 s ; so the only reason for multiplicity of gradient gibbs measures with zero tilt is a phase transition in the  @xmath102-marginal . however , a detailed write - up of this argument would require developing the precise  and somewhat subtle  correspondence between the gradient gibbs measures of a given tilt and the minimizers of the gibbs variational principle ( which we have , in full detail , only for convex periodic potentials  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , to keep the paper at manageable length , we limit ourselves to a weaker result .    the fact that the transition occurs at  @xmath131 satisfying is a consequence of a _ duality _ between the @xmath102-marginals at  @xmath53 and  @xmath145 .",
    "more generally , the duality links the marginal law of the configuration  @xmath146 with the law of  @xmath147 ; see theorem  [ t : dualita ] and remark  [ remark : mira - dualita ] .",
    "[ at the level of gradient fields , the duality provides only a vague link between the flow of the weighted gradients  @xmath148 along a given curve and its flux through this curve . unfortunately , this link does not seem to be particularly useful . ]",
    "the point  @xmath120 is self - dual which makes it the most natural candidate for a transition point .",
    "it is interesting to ponder about what happens when  @xmath114 decreases to one .",
    "presumably , the first - order transition ( for states at zero tilt ) disappears before  @xmath114 reaches one and is replaced by some sort of critical behavior . here",
    "the first problem to tackle is to establish the _ absence _ of first - order phase transition for small  @xmath149 . via a standard duality argument ( see  @xcite ) this would yield a power - law lower bound for bond connectivities at  @xmath131 .",
    "another interesting problem is to determine what happens with measures of non - zero tilt .",
    "we expect that , at least for moderate values of the tilt  @xmath115 , the first - order transition persists but shifts to lower values of  @xmath53 .",
    "thus , one could envision a whole phase diagram in the @xmath53-@xmath115 plane .",
    "unfortunately , we are unable to make any statements of this kind because the standard ways to induce a tilt on the torus ( cf  @xcite ) lead to measures that are not reflection positive",
    ".      we proceed by an outline of the principal steps of the proof to which the remainder of this paper is devoted .",
    "the arguments are close in spirit to those in  @xcite ; the differences arise from the subtleties in the setup due to the gradient nature of the fields .",
    "the main line of reasoning is basically thermodynamical : consider the @xmath102-marginal of the extended torus state  @xmath104 which we will regard as a measure on configurations of ordered and disordered bonds .",
    "let  @xmath150 denote ( the @xmath144 limit of ) the expected fraction of ordered bonds in the torus state at parameter  @xmath53 .",
    "clearly  @xmath150 increases from zero to one as  @xmath53 sweeps through  @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "the principal observation is that , under the assumption  @xmath135 , the quantity  @xmath151 is small , uniformly in  @xmath53 .",
    "hence , @xmath152 must undergo a jump from values near zero to values near one at some  @xmath119 . by usual weak - limiting arguments we construct two distinct gradient gibbs measures at  @xmath131 , one with high density of ordered bonds and the other with high density of disordered bonds .",
    "the crux of the matter is thus to justify the uniform smallness of  @xmath151 .",
    "this will be a consequence of the fact that the simultaneous occurrence of ordered and disordered bonds at any two given locations is ( uniformly ) unlikely .",
    "for instance , let us estimate the probability that a particular plaquette has two ordered bonds emanating out of one corner and two disordered bonds emanating out of the other . here",
    "the technique of chessboard estimates  @xcite allows us to disseminate this pattern all over the torus via successive reflections ( cf theorem  [ t : chess ] in sect .",
    "[ s : chessboard ] ) .",
    "this bounds the quantity of interest by the  @xmath153-power of the probability that every other horizontal ( and vertical ) line is entirely ordered and the remaining lines are disordered .",
    "the resulting `` spin - wave calculation''i.e . , diagonalization of a period-2 covariance matrix in the fourier basis and taking its determinant  is performed ( for all needed patterns ) in sect .",
    "[ s : spin - wave ] .",
    "once the occurrence of a `` bad pattern '' is estimated by means of various spin - wave free energies , we need to prove that these `` bad - pattern '' spin - wave free energies are always worse off than those of the homogeneous patterns ( i.e. , all ordered or all disordered)this is the content of theorem  [ t : min ] .",
    "then we run a standard peierls contour estimate whereby the smallness of  @xmath151 follows . extracting two distinct , infinite - volume , ergodic gradient gibbs states  @xmath121 and  @xmath122 at  @xmath120",
    ", it remains to show that these are both of zero tilt .",
    "here we use the fact that , conditional on the  @xmath102 s , the torus measure is symmetric gaussian with uniformly positive stiffness .",
    "hence , we can use standard gaussian inequalities to show exponential tightness of the tilt , uniformly in the  @xmath102 s ; cf lemma  [ l : tilt ]",
    ". duality calculations ( see sect .  [",
    "s : duality ] ) then yield  @xmath120 .",
    "our proof of phase coexistence applies to any potential of the form shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]even if we return to parametrization by  @xmath10 .",
    "the difference with respect to the present setup is that in the general case we would have to approximate the potentials by a quadratic well at each local minimum and , before performing the requisite gaussian calculations , estimate the resulting  errors .",
    "here is a sketch of the main ideas : we fix a scale  @xmath154 and regard  @xmath48 to be in a well if it is within  @xmath154 of the corresponding local minimum .",
    "then the requisite quadratic approximation of  @xmath10-times energy is good up to errors of order  @xmath155 .",
    "the rest of the potential `` landscape '' lies at energies of at least order  @xmath156 and so it will be only `` rarely visited '' by the  @xmath37 s provided that  @xmath157 . on the other hand",
    ", the same condition ensures that the spin - wave integrals are essentially not influenced by the restriction that  @xmath48 be within  @xmath154 of the local minimum .",
    "thus , to make all approximations work we need that @xmath158 which is achieved for  @xmath159 by , e.g. ,  @xmath160 .",
    "this approach has recently been used to prove phase transitions in classical  @xcite as well as quantum  @xcite systems with highly degenerate ground states .",
    "we refer the reader to these references for further details .",
    "a somewhat more delicate issue is the proof that both coexisting states are of zero tilt . here",
    "the existing techniques require that we have some sort of uniform convexity .",
    "this more or less forces us to use the  @xmath5 s of the form @xmath161 where the  @xmath162 s are uniformly convex functions .",
    "clearly , our choice   is the simplest potential of this type ; the question is how general the potentials obtained this way can be .",
    "we hope to return to this question in a future publication .",
    "as was just mentioned , the core of our proofs are estimates of the spin - wave free energy for various regular patterns of ordered and disordered bonds on the torus .",
    "these estimates are rather technical and so we prefer to clear them out of the way before we get to the main line of the proof .",
    "the readers wishing to follow the proof in linear order may consider skipping this section and returning to it only while reading the arguments in sect .",
    "[ sec4.2 ] . throughout this and the forthcoming sections we assume that  @xmath163 is an even integer .",
