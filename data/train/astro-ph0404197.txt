    "wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars are the evolved , he - burning cores and hot stellar envelopes of once - massive o - type stars .",
    "their strong winds ( terminal velocities : @xmath7  @xmath8  1000  -  2500  km  s@xmath9 ) and heavy mass loss rates ( @xmath10  =  @xmath11~\\times$ ]  10@xmath12  @xmath13  yr@xmath9 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) power their characteristic strong , broad emission lines of he , n , c , and o , which correspond to increasingly evolved evolutionary states .",
    "while the environment and multiplicity of o - type stars have been explored in depth @xcite , these characteristics for the evolved wr phase are not as well determined . in 1996",
    "we initiated a survey with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "wide field and planetary camera 2 ( _ hst _",
    "wfpc2 ) to discover and quantify the multiplicity and environments of galactic wr stars . here",
    "we discuss two of our targets , wr  38 and wr  38a , that were revealed to be both multiple and contained within a small stellar cluster @xcite .",
    "wr  38 is a wc4-type star @xcite and wr  38a is a wn5-type @xcite .",
    "the two are separated by only @xmath14 in the sky , and they are neighbors to another even tighter @xmath15 pair of wr stars , wr  38b and wr  39 , at a separation of @xmath16 .",
    "these four plus wr  37 are surrounded by a ring nebula @xcite , although it is not clearly associated with any one of these stars .",
    "our view in this direction in the galactic plane cuts through the sagittarius - carina spiral arm at distances of approximately 2.4 and 8  kpc @xcite .",
    "the photometric distances of these wr stars are generally close to 5  kpc @xcite , which would place them among the young population of the carina spiral arm . however , in a recent paper @xcite presented photometry for the stars in the immediate vicinity of wr  38 and wr  38a that indicated a much greater distance of @xmath17  kpc .",
    "this distance would place the pair in an extension of the outer perseus arm some 14  kpc from the galactic center .",
    "there are only 4 of 227 known galactic wr stars that have such a great distance from the galactic center @xcite .",
    "@xcite designate the cluster as c1104610a , and images of the field surrounding the cluster are presented in @xcite ( plate  4 ) , @xcite , and @xcite ( fig .  1 and 2 )",
    ".    here we present new astrometric and photometric results on the stars found close to wr  38 and wr  38a based upon _ hst _",
    "pc images with superb angular resolution .",
    "we identify which stars are associated with the wr pair based upon their derived reddening and location in a color - magnitude diagram .",
    "our results are mainly consistent with those of @xcite but we argue that the acceptable distance range is such that the wr pair and its surrounding cluster may reside in the distant portion of the carina spiral arm .",
    "observations of the fields of wr  38 and wr  38a were obtained in 1996 march ( jd 2450166.58 ) through the f336w , f439w , and f555w filters as part of our _ hst _ wfpc2 survey of galactic wr stars .",
    "these wfpc2 filters were designed to correspond to the johnson @xmath18 filter set @xcite , but because of the strong emission lines present in wr spectra the transformation from the _ hst _ to the johnson system is approximate at best for them .",
    "additionally , the wfpc2 f336w filter suffers from a red leak which may cause dusty wr or other very red stars to appear brighter than in a similar @xmath0 band image .",
    "therefore , all of the data reductions and analyses were performed within the wfpc2 synthetic magnitude system @xcite .",
    "we centered the wr stars within the pc chip to take advantage of the high resolution ( scale of @xmath19 pixel@xmath9 ) .",
    "the observations also utilized a high gain setting , with a threshold of @xmath20  53000 photoelectrons pixel@xmath9 , to optimize the discovery of faint companions . for each observation we made two exposures to facilitate the removal of cosmic rays ( 40  s for the f336w , 10  s for the f439w , and 2  s for the f555w filter ) .",
    "since these are snapshot - type observations , which are designed to fill holes in the _ hst _ schedule , the observations were taken using only one guide star .",
    "fortunately , due to the short exposure times , this resulted in no discernible loss of data quality due to telescope motion , although this did place limits on the accuracy of the absolute astrometry as the telescope may roll during the observation @xcite .",
    "wr  38 is sufficiently close to wr  38a that both stars could be captured within the same wfpc2 image ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "image clearly shows a number of components surrounding both wr stars that are not fully resolved in ground - based images @xcite . without spectroscopic data we can only estimate the identity of the wr star within each stellar grouping by assuming it is the brightest object within the existing astrometric error box .",
    "the numbering system we adopted is based upon angular separation from wr  38 ( star # 1 ) , and wr  38a is labeled as # 21 .",
    "after normal pipeline processing @xcite , we aligned the six raw images using the task imalign in iraf / stsdas .",
    "we then combined each pair of images per filter using the routine crrej .",
    "we identified the stars in each combined image using the task daofind with the detection threshold set at @xmath21 over the background level .",
    "we determined a background value by using the imexamine routine to derive the mean background value within @xmath22 pixel boxes located at 510 well - distributed positions across the image .",
    "the single average of these values was used for the detection threshold .    because the observations were made with just one guide star",
    ", the images may suffer from telescope roll and jitter .",
    "consequently , the point spread function ( psf ) of the stellar images may be asymmetrical , leading the daofind algorithm to select false stars .",
    "thus , all the detected stars were visually inspected before acceptance .",
    "we used this list as input to the iraf / stsdas package metric to derive the astrometric information given in table  1 .",
    "metric translates the wfpc2 pixel positions to celestial coordinates after correcting for geometric distortion .",
    "the relative positions of well - exposed stars are accurate to better than @xmath23 for targets imaged on one chip ( errors are primarily due to centering uncertainties ) . however , while the relative positions are highly accurate , the absolute positions of the objects are subject to larger errors of @xmath24 arcseconds due to the use of a single guide star @xcite .",
    "fifteen of the stars in table  1 appear in the _",
    "2mass all - sky catalog of point sources _",
    "@xcite , and the mean differences in the coordinates are @xmath25  s and @xmath26 .",
    "we performed aperture photometry using the iraf package daophot @xcite .",
    "we chose aperture photometry over psf photometry because of the difficulties involved in fitting the psf due to the small telescope motions .",
    "we used an 11 pixel ( @xmath27 ) radius aperture to determine the total stellar flux , and we estimated the sky background using the ofilter algorithm within the phot package of daophot ( as recommended by @xcite ) .",
    "a number of photometric corrections are required to transform from raw to calibrated magnitudes @xcite .",
    "the stellar magnitudes were corrected for charge transfer efficiency using the @xcite formula for faint sources and the @xcite formula for more luminous sources ( brighter than @xmath28 ) .",
    "geometric distortion effects were corrected using a scheme that rescaled the flux measurements of the stars based on their positions within the image .",
    "contamination corrections were made using information taken from the wfpc2 web site .",
    "the @xmath29 row effect was corrected using the scheme of @xcite .",
    "most significantly , the zero - point corrections for the f555w and f439w magnitude data were calculated using the @xcite updates to the original @xcite offsets .",
    "the @xcite revisions to the @xcite zero - points ( @xmath30 mag ) are not the result of temporal effects , but rather of improved calibration methods , and hence , they have greater accuracy . unfortunately , dolphin did not provide updates for the f336w filter , so we used the @xcite calibration for the f336w filter images .    our final magnitudes in the _ hst _ system are collected in table  2 .",
    "we have included a transformation of the _ hst _ wide - band magnitudes to johnson @xmath31 using the scheme of @xcite .",
    "we caution that this scheme may not be reliable for the wr stars since both the @xmath1 and @xmath2 band - passes are sensitive to the strong emission lines present in wr spectra @xcite .",
    "we did not attempt to transform our f336w magnitudes to johnson @xmath0 since the latter straddles the balmer jump while the former is sensitive mainly to shorter wavelength flux .",
    "we have also included in table  2 the corresponding identification number ( stp ) and magnitude information from the work of @xcite for 7 stars in common ( mainly cluster members ) .",
    "we found that there are systematic differences between our transformed @xmath2 and @xmath32 magnitudes compared to those of @xcite .",
    "we omitted the wr stars from this comparison because of our concerns about the transformation to johnson magnitudes , and this leaves 5 stars in common between our samples .",
    "we find mean differences of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , i.e. , the mean differences are larger than the standard deviations from the mean differences ( and the standard deviations are comparable to the expected observational errors ) .",
    "these differences are probably due to errors in the adopted zero - points for the wfpc2 images .",
    "we have found , for example , that there is an intrinsic scatter of order 0.1  mag between the observed and synthetic _ hst _ magnitudes for some two dozen wr stars with nuv spectroscopy from the _ international ultraviolet explorer satellite _ and optical spectrophotometry @xcite .",
    "while part of this scatter may be due to errors in the calibration of the spectrophotometry , we caution that zero - point offsets of order 0.1  mag may be required to place our photometric results on an absolute scale .",
    "thus , the relative magnitudes for stars within a given image are secure , but color indices formed from magnitude differences between images may require a zero - point shift . in the next section",
    "we describe one way of estimating the zero - point adjustments based upon a reddening analysis of multi - wavelength photometry .",
    "extinction due to interstellar dust decreases at longer wavelengths , so the best approach to determining reddening and extinction is to compare both long and short wavelength flux measurements with spectral models transformed using a suitable reddening law . we were pleased to learn that 15 of the 25 targets in our _ hst _ field are included in the _",
    "2mass all - sky catalog of point sources _ @xcite that lists @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 magnitudes for most of them . here",
    "we examine the 2mass , _ hst _ , and , where available , johnson magnitudes from @xcite in order to estimate the reddening for each target .",
    "our approach is to calculate synthetic magnitudes in each band based on a consistent spectral flux distribution for a given zams stellar effective temperature , @xmath38 , and a given reddening , @xmath39 .",
    "we assembled a small grid of theoretical spectra covering the wavelength range of interest for zams stars along the upper main sequence .",
    "we used model spectra based on non - lte , line - blanketed model atmospheres from @xcite for the o - stars ( for effective temperatures of 27500 , 35000 , and 45000  k ) , and we adopted spectra from lte models by r.  l.kurucz for the b - stars ( for 10000 , 15000 , 20000 , and 24000  k ) .",
    "the gravity @xmath40 for each temperature was taken from the 1  myr zams sequence of @xcite .",
    "in addition to the computational differences between the kurucz and lanz & hubeny models , the former assume a microturbulence of 4  km  s@xmath9 while the latter use 10  km  s@xmath9 . despite these differences ,",
    "the predicted flux distributions generally make a smooth transition at the temperature boundary between them ( where non - lte effects for hydrogen become negligible ) .",
    "we calculated synthetic magnitudes for these spectra using the synphot routine calcphot @xcite , which is distributed with the stsdas package in iraf .",
    "the software includes the spectral response functions for the _ hst _ wide band filters as well as those for the standard johnson filters .",
    "however , we used the response functions from @xcite to simulate the sampling of the spectra in the ir with the 2mass filter system",
    ". the procedure returns synthetic magnitudes on the vegamag system , so defined that vega has a magnitude 0.0 in all filters . since vega actually has magnitudes @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 in the johnson system , we adjusted the both the johnson and corresponding _ hst _ synthetic magnitudes by these amounts to make them consistent with observations .",
    "the resulting synthetic zams colors relative to johnson @xmath2 and the absolute @xmath37 magnitude are collected in table  3 for our grid of stellar effective temperatures .",
    "these are generally in reasonable agreement with johnson color indices published by @xcite and @xcite except perhaps for the shortest wavelengths and hottest stars .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite argue that the hottest o - stars have @xmath44 versus our lower limit of @xmath45 .",
    "note that the @xmath46 and @xmath32 color indices are often based on uncertain de - reddening procedures for o - type stars , which may tend to produce colors that are too blue .",
    "the lowest @xmath45 for the 45000  k model is consistent with that for the bluest o - stars in the galaxy @xcite and in the lmc @xcite .",
    "we next transformed each of these model spectra for a grid of 40 values of @xmath39 from 0 to 3.9 using the reddening scheme of @xcite for a ratio of total - to - selective extinction of @xmath5 ( the same as adopted by @xcite ) .",
    "we then used calcphot to determine the predicted color indices as a function of the reddening .",
    "a set of sample reddening curves is shown in figure  2 for the 35000  k model spectrum .",
    "note that unlike the other filters the color index trend for the _ hst _ f336w filter undergoes a reversal at large reddening because of a red - leak in this filter .",
    "we performed a numerical grid search to find the stellar temperature and reddening that best matched a given set of ir and optical color indices .",
    "we found this scheme was able to confirm the known reddening in a number of test cases for ob stars where johnson @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 and 2mass @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 magnitudes were available , but the method is not applicable to stars with temperatures cooler than our grid limit of 10000  k. we applied the method to all the stars in our wfpc2 field for which 2mass photometric data exist .",
    "these stars are listed in table  4 , which gives our assigned number , the 2mass designation , the number adopted by @xcite , our derived reddening , and de - reddened estimates of @xmath47 and @xmath37 ( see below ) .",
    "there are several stars with relatively low reddening that are probably foreground objects , but most of the other stars have a reddening in the range @xmath48 to 2.0 ( with the possible exception of the faint star # 8) .",
    "there are four cluster stars with a complete set of wfpc2 , johnson @xcite , and 2mass magnitudes ( after omission of the two wr stars for which the method may be poor ) , and the mean reddening for these four stars is @xmath49 ( mean error ) , in good agreement with the result of @xmath50 from @xcite .",
    "we can use these reddening fits to return to the question of magnitude zero - point offsets that we raised in the previous section .",
    "table  5 lists the average values of the residuals from the fit for each filter based on the same sample of four stars with complete magnitude coverage .",
    "these represent any systematical offsets between the observed magnitudes and the synthetic magnitudes derived from the theoretical spectra , so they encompass any lingering problems in the observational zero - points , filter responses , and wavelength specific deficiencies in the theoretical models .",
    "the offsets in table  5 are generally small and comparable to the scatter in the residuals , but there are some interesting exceptions .",
    "we see , for example , that the mean difference in the residuals for @xmath51 is @xmath52 , which is the same within errors as the difference between the transformed @xmath53 and @xmath54 that we found in the last section .",
    "similarly the residuals in @xmath55 suggest that our uncorrected color index is too blue in the same way as demonstrated in our comparison of our transformed @xmath32 with the colors from @xcite .",
    "thus , the mean residuals in table  5 lead us to revise our original wfpc2 zeropoints to 18.305 for the f336w filter , 20.036 for the f439w filter , and 21.496 for the f555w filter .",
    "an application of these zero - point corrections should provide consistent results across for the entire set of photometric measurements .",
    "we give in columns 5 and 6 of table  4 the individually de - reddened color index @xmath47 ( including a zero - point offset of @xmath56 from the mean residuals in table  5 ) and extinction corrected @xmath37 ( using a zero - point offset of @xmath57 from table  5 ) that we will use in the next section to estimate the cluster distance .",
    "we caution that these results are sensitive to the adopted value of total - to - selective extinction @xmath58 .",
    "this parameter is often estimated by comparing the reddening @xmath39 to the extinction in the ir , and we used equations a3 , a4 , and a5 from @xcite to estimate @xmath58 for the four stars with complete johnson and 2mass photometry .",
    "the mean derived value , @xmath59 , is consistent within errors with our assumed value of @xmath5 , but the application of reddening curves for @xmath60 leads to a mean reddening of @xmath61 for the same sample of four stars using the scheme outlined above .",
    "we discuss below how such a revision in the reddening law influences the distance estimate .",
    "we can estimate the distance to the cluster surrounding wr  38 and wr  38a based upon the positions of the stars in a de - reddened color and extinction corrected magnitude diagram .",
    "the spectral flux distributions of massive stars appear similar to the rayleigh - jeans tail of a blackbody spectrum in the optical and near - ir spectral range , and we need spectral line diagnostics ( primarily through spectral classification ) in order to estimate the stellar effective temperature reliably ( and thus establish the luminosity of the star relative to the main sequence ) . in the absence of spectral data ,",
    "the best approach is to use a color index based upon the widest wavelength range possible as a temperature parameter .",
    "we selected the @xmath47 index for this purpose , which spans a range of nearly 3 magnitudes over the ob star temperature range ( compared with a range of only @xmath62 mag in @xmath32 ; see table  3 ) .",
    "we also decided to use @xmath37 for the magnitude ordinate in the color  magnitude diagram since it is least affected by uncertainties in extinction .",
    "the color  magnitude diagram for the wr  38 cluster in this magnitude system is illustrated in figure  3 .",
    "the @xmath47 colors were de - reddened and the @xmath37 magnitudes extinction corrected using the individual @xmath39 values determined for each star in the last section ( table  4 ) .",
    "in addition , the zero - point corrections found from the mean residuals to the reddening solutions ( table  5 ) were applied to bring the observed magnitudes into the synthetic magnitude system needed to compare the observed and theoretical color  magnitude diagrams .",
    "there are five stars that have similar positions in figure  3 that probably correspond to the cluster main sequence .",
    "one bright star , # 7 , is located above the main sequence , and it is either an evolved , luminous star within the cluster or a foreground object .",
    "the two wr stars are found well to the right of the main sequence , which is probably due to the strong emission lines found in the @xmath37-band @xcite .",
    "we adopted the 1  myr zams from the models of @xcite to determine the distance modulus from the difference of the observed and theoretical absolute magnitudes .",
    "we compared our synthetic color index @xmath47 values from synphot / calcphot for our temperature grid with the corresponding values from the tables of @xcite , and we found a mean difference of @xmath63 mag .",
    "we added this small offset to the model zams color index from @xcite in order to intercompare the colors consistently in the synthetic system .",
    "we then compared the observed and model colors for a grid of assumed distance modulus values to determine the best fit estimate .",
    "the derived distance modulus is @xmath64 based on the @xmath65 residuals of the fit ( corresponding to a distance of @xmath66  kpc ) . at this distance , the five main sequence stars in figure  3 have colors and magnitudes of zams stars in the temperature range 33000 to 38000  k , which are characteristic of o - type stars .",
    "our distance modulus estimate agrees within errors with that derived by @xcite , @xmath67 .",
    "the small difference in distance modulus between these investigations is probably due to differences in the adopted zams isochrone .",
    "the zams relation adopted by @xcite ( from @xcite ) is an empirical relation based upon a somewhat evolved population of stars , and it is approximately 0.8  mag brighter at @xmath68 than the theoretical 1  myr zams that we adopted from @xcite . note that @xcite verified that the geneva models used by @xcite yield absolute magnitudes that agree with those determined for eclipsing binaries after a correction is made for evolution from the zams .",
    "we also show in figure  3 the isochrone for an age of 8  myr , approximately equal to the maximum age of clusters containing wr stars @xcite , and a comparison of the isochrones shows that we may be underestimating the distance modulus by @xmath69  mag if the cluster is signftpificantly older than assumed .",
    "unfortunately , we do not know the age of the cluster , and consequently the amount of evolutionary brightening at the upper end of the main sequence is unknown .",
    "deeper photometric observations could resolve this problem through zams fitting of less massive , unevolved stars .    if the ratio of total - to - selective extinction is revised upwards to @xmath60 (  3 ) , then the derived reddening is smaller and the intrinsic @xmath47 colors are larger than shown in figure  3 .",
    "such a revision would lead to a decrease in distance modulus to a value of 13.5  mag , slightly below the @xmath70 error limit quoted above for the @xmath5 model fit .",
    "thus , given the uncertainties in the cluster age and the reddening law , the range in acceptable distance modulus value may be somewhat larger than given above .",
    "taken at face value , our analysis does not improve upon the the distance estimate from @xcite , @xmath71  kpc , but we caution that their error refers only to internal sources and at this stage it is prudent to acknowledge an error range that accounts for systematical errors resulting from assumptions about the cluster isochrone and reddening law .",
    "our line of sight towards wr  38 ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 ) passes twice through the carina spiral arm ( see fig .  4 of @xcite ) and we can use information from co radio emission maps to help place the giant molecular clouds and associated massive star forming regions along this line of sight .",
    "@xcite and @xcite show that there is a large and rare hole in the near side of the carina spiral arm in this direction that might allow us to see some very distant clusters .",
    "this first cut through the arm occurs at distance of @xmath74  kpc , and @xcite discuss some of the sparsely populated field stars they find at this distance .",
    "the next molecular cloud down the line is found at a distance of 6.8  kpc in the direction @xmath75 , @xmath76 ( with a radial velocity of @xmath77 km  s@xmath9 and designated # 14 in fig .  2 of @xcite ) , which is located about @xmath78 away from the wr  38 cluster .",
    "this distance is consistent with the distance error range for the wr  38 cluster and the other nearby wr stars .",
    "however , just beyond this at 7.9  kpc we encounter one of the largest molecular clouds in the carina spiral arm ( with a radial velocity of @xmath79 km  s@xmath9 and given as # 13 in fig .  2 of @xcite ) where our line of sight crosses the spiral arm a second time .",
    "the wr  38 cluster lies only @xmath80 away from the edge of this cloud .",
    "there is very little co emission in the @xmath81 diagram corresponding to distances beyond this , so it is doubtful that there are favorable environments for massive star formation beyond a distance of 8  kpc in this direction ( see also fig .  5 in @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite present deep radio maps of 21  cm emission from neutral hydrogen in this region that suggest that some weak emission is present from an extension of the perseus arm ( at a distance of @xmath82  kpc and a radial velocity of @xmath83 km  s@xmath9 ) and a possible outer arm ( at a distance of @xmath84  kpc and a radial velocity of @xmath85 km  s@xmath9 ) .",
    "the outer disks of large spiral galaxies occasionally show clear h  i spiral arms extending to radii in excess of 30  kpc , while the stellar arms stop at radii of about 10  kpc .",
    "a classic example is m83 , where the h  i spiral arms extend three times as far as the stellar arms @xcite .",
    "note that there are very few wr stars known in the milky way galaxy beyond the solar circle ( see fig .  6 in @xcite ) , where they would be easy to discover if they existed there ( due to generally low reddening ) .",
    "furthermore , the number ratio of wr to o - type stars decreases dramatically in low metallicity environments such as the outer galaxy , so even if there are fair numbers of o stars in the outer galaxy , there will be relatively many fewer wr stars there .    @xcite discuss the stars that are associated with h  ii regions in this general direction , and they find that the extinction ranges from @xmath86 at 2.8  kpc to @xmath87 at 4.2  kpc , and up to @xmath88 at 8  kpc .",
    "our derived extinction of @xmath89 would tend to suggest that the wr  38 cluster also resides at a distance of @xmath6  kpc or larger .",
    "the 8  kpc distance would place the wr  38 cluster approximately midway between molecular cloud # 13 ( and associated h  ii complex @xmath90 ; @xcite ) and molecular cloud # 17 ( h  ii complex @xmath91 ) which is associated with the starburst cluster ngc  3603 @xcite .",
    "note that @xcite find a reddening of @xmath92 in the outskirts of ngc  3603 that is comparable to that for the wr  38 cluster .",
    "@xcite identify an h  ii region @xmath93 within the larger @xmath90 complex that has as exciting stars # 48 and # 52 from the list of @xcite .",
    "the two stars have a comparable extinction ( @xmath94 ) and are located only @xmath95 away from the cluster , so these stars and the h  ii region could be related to the wr  38/wr  38a cluster .",
    "the solution to the distance problem for the wr  38/wr  38a cluster will come when spectra can be obtained for the cluster stars .",
    "classification dispersion spectra would help establish the temperatures and luminosities of the stars , and thus determine accurately the distance modulus of the cluster .",
    "furthermore , radial velocities from spectra would also allow us to distinguish between the differential galactic rotation expected for the locations along the carina and perseus spiral arms .",
    "such observations would clearly help us understand the history of massive star formation in this distant region of the galaxy .",
