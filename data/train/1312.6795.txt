    "<S> note that for @xmath0 the relativistic corrections due to the vector meson wave function may be larger than for the @xmath1 , where they were found to suppress the cross section by about 6% @xcite . while a part of the relativistic corrections related to the wave function at the origin is accounted for using @xmath20 , the measured electronic width of the @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , one may expect a further suppression in the case of @xmath0 compared to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we do not account for this .    </S>",
    "<S> what additional uncertainties are there in our predictions for the gluon distribution ? </S>",
    "<S> first , there may be an uncertainty arising from the skewed factor which accounts for the difference between the conventional ( diagonal ) gluon pdf and the generalised ( gpd ) distribution . as described in  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we use the shuvaev transform to relate the diagonal pdf and the gpd . </S>",
    "<S> this provides sufficient accuracy , @xmath39 , in our low @xmath40 domain . </S>",
    "<S> next , there may be an uncertainty coming from the real part of the amplitude , which is evaluated approximately . again </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding uncertainty is small ( less than @xmath41 ) in the low @xmath40 region , where the @xmath40 dependence is not steep and the @xmath42 ratio is rather small . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that the uncertainties , both from the skewed factor and the @xmath42 ratio , apply to @xmath43 and _ not _ to the ratio of the @xmath0 to @xmath1 cross sections in which they cancel almost exactly . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the main uncertainty in the @xmath0 cross section , calculated using the gluon extracted from the @xmath1 data , is that coming from the relativistic correction for @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : sigmapsi2sw ] displays our results for the @xmath44 cross section in lo and nlo . </S>",
    "<S> the width of the shaded bands gives the @xmath45 uncertainty from the @xmath1 experimental data used in the gluon fits . </S>",
    "<S> note that we do not include the available @xmath0 data from h1  @xcite in the gluon fit , they are shown just for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> the data  @xcite only gives the values of the ratio of the @xmath0 to @xmath1 cross sections . to obtain the @xmath0 photoproduction data points displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sigmapsi2sw ] we use the fit @xmath46  nb for the @xmath1 cross section obtained by h1  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our predictions are slightly above the data .    </S>",
    "<S> we can now make predictions for exclusive @xmath0 production in ultraperipheral @xmath2 collisions as a function of the @xmath0 rapidity , using the @xmath13 cross section . </S>",
    "<S> note that for a given rapidity @xmath47 , two @xmath23 subprocesses with different @xmath23 centre - of - mass energies squared , @xmath48 , and different photon fluxes , @xmath49 , contribute , depending on which of the protons acts as photon emitter and which as target , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : psi2sproc ] . in the absence of forward proton tagging these two subprocesses can not be distinguished and must be added , see  ( [ eq : sigmappth ] ) below .    </S>",
    "<S> recall that our analysis is well justified at small @xmath40 , @xmath50 , which provides good accuracy of both the shuvaev transform , used to relate the diagonal gluons and gpds , and the real part contribution . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the simple expression used to parametrize the gluon distribution is not appropriate at large @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 data included in the gluon fit  @xcite , used in this analysis , contains the low energy @xmath51 contribution to the lhc data for which the small @xmath40 approximation is not justified . in future analyses , it may be better to repeat the gluon fit after subtracting the contribution arising from the low energy @xmath51 configuration from the lhc @xmath52 ultraperipheral @xmath2 production data . to estimate this contribution a fit to the low energy fixed target data measured at e401 and e516  @xcite could be used . </S>",
    "<S> this low energy fixed target fit along with a further fit to the ratio of the @xmath0 to @xmath1 photoproduction cross sections , measured by h1  @xcite , would allow the @xmath51 contribution to @xmath0 ultraperipheral @xmath2 production cross sections to be estimated . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , for @xmath0 the size of the @xmath51 contribution is small relative to the @xmath53 contribution due to the lower photon energy and small low energy photoproduction cross section . </S>",
    "<S> thus , though our theory prediction overestimates the @xmath51 contribution to the ultraperipheral @xmath2 production its contribution is dominated by the @xmath53 contribution .     production in ultraperipheral @xmath2 collisions . @xmath53 and @xmath51 are the @xmath54 centre - of - mass energies . </S>",

    "<S> the columns labelled @xmath57 give the survival factors for the two independent subprocesses at different @xmath23 centre - of - mass energies @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in hadron collisions we also have to take into account additional soft interactions between the colliding hadrons , which can destroy the exclusive signature ( rapidity gap ) of the event . the necessary gap survival factors for @xmath0 production </S>",
    "<S> are calculated using the two - channel eikonal model from  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they are displayed in table  [ tab : a1 ] for the three different @xmath2 centre - of - mass energies of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 tev and for a large range of rapidities as relevant for the lhc experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the columns labelled @xmath59 and @xmath60 give the suppression factors for the two different @xmath23 energies @xmath58 as a function of rapidity for each @xmath2 centre - of - mass energy .    </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical prediction for the exclusive @xmath0 production in ultraperipheral @xmath2 collisions , @xmath61 , in terms of our exclusive photoproduction cross sections , @xmath62 , for the two subprocesses @xmath13 at energies @xmath58 is therefore given by @xmath63 the photon energies are given by @xmath64 and the photon fluxes are calculated as described in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our cross section predictions are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : psicomb ] for the three @xmath2 centre - of - mass energies of @xmath65 and @xmath5 tev . as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sigmapsi2sw ] , the bands only indicate the experimental uncertainty of the gluon fit parameters used for the lo and nlo predictions .    in summary , following and supplementing  @xcite , we have predicted the cross section for exclusive @xmath0 production in ultraperipheral @xmath2 collisions at the lhc , using gluon parametrisations extracted from hera and lhc exclusive @xmath1 production data . in principle , </S>",
    "<S> once precise @xmath0 data become available , they could be included in a combined analysis , together with @xmath1 and possibly @xmath66 data . </S>",
    "<S> such an analysis , depending on the accuracy of the data , will require a more detailed understanding of the relativistic corrections from the vector meson wave functions and would benefit from a complete next - to - leading order prediction of the underlying elastic vector meson production process , @xmath67 , which is beyond the scope of this paper . </S>"
