    "this is several times as big as for two graphene sheets , but several times as small as for two plates made of ordinary materials or for an atom above a plate . according to our results , at separations above @xmath1 m at @xmath111k",
    "the casimir - polder interaction of atoms with graphene is of the same strength as with an ideal - metal plane .",
    "this differs essentially from the previously investigated case of zero temperature where atom - graphene interaction was found to be as much as only 5% of the interaction of graphene with an ideal - metal plane .",
    "qualitatively , the classical casimir - polder interaction of atoms with graphene was likened to the interaction with thin metallic film .",
    "finally , we have obtained simple analytic expressions for the casimir - polder interaction of an atom ( microparticle ) with thin magnetodielectric films deposited on both dielectric and metallic substrates made of magnetic or nonmagnetic materials .",
    "it was shown that in the case of magnetodielectric ( dielectric ) film deposited on metallic substrate the contributions to the csimir - polder free energy and force due to the magnetic atomic polarizability depend on the used model of metal .",
    "one can conclude that the classical casimir - polder interaction of atoms with thin films and graphene discussed above differs significantly from the interaction with thick cavity walls , and this might be interesting for future experiments on atom - surface interactions .",
