    "in the @xmath17 k limit , the _ continuous _ suppression of an ordered - state , leads to a singularity denominated quantum - critical point ( qcp ) which separates ordered and disordered states.@xcite for intermetallic heavy - fermion compounds displaying an antiferromagnetic ground - state , two types of qcps were identified : i ) the suppression to zero temperature of a fermi surface ( fs ) instability which leads to a spin density wave ( sdw ) ground state whose quantum - critical behavior is described in terms of the fluctuations of the sdw order parameter @xcite and ii ) the continuous destruction of the kondo - effect at the afm to paramagnetic transition , which seems to lead to a discontinuous change in the fermi surface volume across the qcp.@xcite here , we study the possibility of detecting magnetic field - induced quantum - criticality in cecu@xmath1ge@xmath1 since both , its antiferromagnetic sdw ground - state and the kondo - effect , can be suppressed by an external magnetic - field .",
    "if the suppression of either energy scale was continuous , the field would be expected to tune the system towards a quantum - critical point , making cecu@xmath1ge@xmath1 an ideal system for probing the universality of either quantum - critical scenario .",
    "regardless of the field orientation , we find that both energy scales as well as the kondo - coherence temperature are seemingly continuously suppressed by the field . however , at low temperatures this does not necessarily lead to clear experimental evidence for quantum - criticality except when the field is applied along the @xmath18-axis .",
    "this would be at odds with the above mentioned quantum - critical scenarios , for which the continuous suppression of all relevant energy scales should necessarily lead to a quantum - critical point , and therefore to a line of quantum - critical points in the field as a function of angle phase - diagram .",
    "to date only few metallic systems such as ybrh@xmath1si@xmath1 , cecoin@xmath19 , cerhin@xmath19 or sr@xmath20ru@xmath1o@xmath21 , have been claimed to display a field - induced quantum critical point . among those ,",

    "the the conventional lifshitz - kosevich formalism would seem to break down upon approaching a field - induced qcp with the renormalization of the quasiparticle effective mass being spin dependent.@xcite it is unclear at the moment if all quantum critical systems would display similar behavior . as we show below",

    "given that the excited cef quasi - quartet is located at very high energies with respect to the ground - state doublet , it is quite unlikely that any of the observed metamagnetic transitions would be due to crossings among cef levels .",
    "one is left with two scenarios i )  local - moment \" metamagnetism resulting from spin reorientations under @xmath4 , and ii ) field - induced sdw transitions ( fisdw ) resulting from a competition between the nesting vector and the inverse of the magnetic wave - length , as the area of the electronic orbit on the fs is required to accommodate an increasing number of magnetic flux quanta , and as observed in quasi - one - dimensional organic conductors.@xcite the first scenario would imply a plausible progressive suppression of the kondo - effect , but the resulting local - moment physics should lead to magnetization quasi - plateaus corresponding to stable spin - configurations within narrow field windows , in contrast to what is seen .",
    "the second scenario , only requires nearly nested two - dimensional fss which have indeed been predicted by band structure calculations.@xcite in addition , the fs reconstructed by the sdw transition is susceptible to the zeeman effect , particularly in a strongly correlated material where the land _",
    "g_-factor is likely to be larger than 2 .",
    "the concomitant magnetic field - induced fs deformation would favor slightly distinct nesting - vectors at particular critical fields .",
    "therefore , cecu@xmath1ge@xmath1 could correspond to unique example of a moderately anisotropic material displaying a cascade of fisdw transitions .",
    "figure 1 * d * also displays the oscillatory component superimposed onto the @xmath83 signal ( red lines ) , or the dhva - effect , obtained by subtracting a polynomial background .",
    "we were not able to detected the dhva - effect within the nel phase which is probably a consequence of much heavier effective masses , requiring even lower @xmath63s .",
    "figure 2 displays the derivative of the magnetic torque @xmath84 normalized by the field @xmath4 with respect to @xmath4 and as function of @xmath4 at @xmath85 mk , to unveil the hysteresis or the absence of thereof , associated with some of the metamagnetic transitions . the term ",
    "metamagnetic  is used here to indicate a super - linear increase in @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the magnetization .",
    "blue lines depict data collected during field - up sweeps , while the magenta lines correspond to the ones collected during field - down sweeps .",
    "the metamagnetic transitions preceding the suppression of the sdw - state are indicated by red arrows , while the transition towards the paramagnetic state is indicated by cyan blue arrows .",
    "notice that the transitions indicated by the red arrows , lead to sharp features in @xmath88 and in most cases , also to a pronounced hysteresis which are indications for 1@xmath71-order phase - transitions .",
    "most importantly , for both orientations the transition towards the paramagnetic state is clearly non - hysteretic , even at these low temperatures , indicating they are 2@xmath22-order in nature . in the bottom panel , the anomalies or dips in the field - up sweep trace ( blue )",
    "are artifacts associated with the field - up sweep pattern : @xmath4 was increased at a higher rate than the one used for the field - decreasing sweep trace .",
    "this higher rate induces eddy currents in the probe and in the cryostat leading to an increase in the temperature of the dilution refrigerator , i.e. by about @xmath82 to @xmath89 mk .",
    "each dip corresponds to moments in time where the sweep rate was brought down to zero , leading to a momentary decrease in temperature .",
    "therefore , the apparent hysteresis between field - up and -down traces can be simply attributed to the extreme sensitivity of the torque technique to small changes in @xmath63 induced by the distinct field sweep rates .",
    "we have expressly chosen both traces to illustrate that even with these less than ideal circumstances , one does not detect any clear hysteresis in the position in field where the phase - transition towards the paramagnetic state occurs .",
    "this is a clear indication for a 2@xmath22-order phase - transition , which ought to become quantum - critical in @xmath17 k limit .",

    "@xcite notice that the @xmath92 , or conventional fl - behavior , is recovered at higher fields ( see 32 t trace ) , indicating that one has driven the system away from the @xmath93 region dominated by the quantum - critical fluctuations .",

    "the evolution of the @xmath96 coefficient as a function of @xmath97-axis , does not provide any clear indication for the proximity to a qcp , which is typically a power law dependence ; @xmath98 with @xmath99.@xcite @xmath100 just decreases slightly as @xmath4 increases . to illustrate the evolution of the exponent @xmath101 as a function of both @xmath63 and @xmath4 , we generated contour plots from a number of @xmath91 traces acquired under fixed fields applied either along the _ a_- or the _ c_-axis shown in figs",

    "thus , at low-@xmath63s the coexistence of non - fl behavior likely due to qc - fluctuations , with a strongly @xmath111-order transition , would be an indication for its proximity to a quantum - critical end - point ( accessible upon field rotation ) , and this would reconcile our observations with those of ref . .",
    "the second region centred around @xmath115 t is where @xmath79 reaches saturation or a pm - state due to the suppression of the sdw - state , with the anomalous exponent indicating concomitant quantum - critical fluctuations . for fields along the _",

    "the @xmath100-coefficient is related to the electronic contribution to the specific heat @xmath122 through the kadowaki - woods ratio @xmath123 such a decrease in @xmath100 points towards a severe reduction in the density of states at the fermi - level or equivalently , to a strong decrease in quasiparticle effective - masses and electron - electron interactions at the sdw to pm transition . in fig .",
    "4 * b * according to our experimental evidence , the phase - boundary between af and pm states is 2@xmath22-order in nature suggesting the possibility of a quantum - critical line in the @xmath16 diagram as well as the existence of a _ quantum - tricritical point _ ( in @xmath17 k limit ) at the angle where it bifurcates.@xcite all the other lines correspond to 1@xmath71-order transitions , except for the gray line which results from a very mild , barely detectable anomaly in @xmath79 . notice that all these 1@xmath71-order lines disappear as @xmath4 is rotated towards the",

    "in summary , we find that the kondo and coherence temperatures as well as the spin - density wave transition - temperature can be suppressed by the application of an external magnetic field through a second - order phase - transition , regardless of its crystallographic orientation .",
    "a priori this would suggest a few possibilities : i ) a 2@xmath22-order line in the @xmath16 phase diagram , leading to a quantum - critical line where all relevant energy scales , nel , coherence and kondo - temperatures collapse leading to a line of quantum critical points , ii ) quantum - criticality driven solely by the suppression of the kondo - effect , which is consistent with the light masses observed in the pm - state for @xmath147 , and iii ) qc driven solely by the suppression of sdw - state leading to hot spots on the fermi surface associated with the nesting wave - vector , and which would lead to heavy electron - masses . since we could not detect heavy masses , or non - fl behavior for fields along the _ c_-axis or in wide angular window around it , our results are difficult to reconcile with scenarios i ) and ii ) . however , according to prevailing quantum - critical scenarios a 2@xmath22-order line in the field as a function of angle phase - diagram , where all relevant energy scales , in particular the spin - density wave transition - temperature , are continuously suppressed by the magnetic - field , should lead to a line of quantum critical points in the limit of zero temperature . therefore , our study unveiling non - fermi liquid behavior and mass divergence only when the field is aligned along the @xmath18-axis is a clear challenge to our current understanding of quantum criticality ( in contrast to recent theoretical progress in describing model a system @xcite ) and suggests the existence of fermi surface hot spots located nearly along the @xmath148 direction most likely associated with a three dimensional nesting wave - vector .",
    "hence , in the limit of very low temperatures the observation of a second - order phase transition associated to the suppression of an order - parameter by tuning a physical parameter , such as magnetic field , would seem not to be a sufficient condition for the observation of quantum criticality .",
    "we want to finish by emphasizing that the complexity of the cecu@xmath1ge@xmath1 phase - diagram as a function of temperature , field and angle , which suggests the possible existence of quantum tricritical and quantum - critical end points associated with multiple 1@xmath71-order metamagnetic transitions , will contribute to enrich our overall understanding of quantum criticality .",
    "for example , the results in ref .",
    "indicate a quantum phase - transition for @xmath149 t applied along the [ -110]-direction , which is observed by us to become strongly 1@xmath71-order ( albeit coexisting with non - fermi liquid behavior ) when @xmath150 t is applied along the [ 100]-direction .",
    "this suggests the existence of a qc end - point which can be accessed by varying the field - orientation with respect to the crystallographic axes .",
    "however , it remains unclear at the moment , from ours as well as the results in ref .",
    ", if such a qc end - point would be directly accessed by varying temperature and angle or if phase - formation would conceal it.@xcite this aspect , as well as a full comparison between the overall physical properties observed at low temperatures around @xmath151 \\simeq 8 \\text { t}$ ] and @xmath152 \\simeq 29.5 \\text { t}$ ] deserve future attention . as for quantum tri - critical point(s ) it is a concept claimed to be relevant for the high - temperature superconductivity observed in the fe arsenide superconductors@xcite or for the anomalous non - fermi liquid behavior observed in mnsi.@xcite insofar it has been experimentally challenging to precisely tune either system towards a putative quantum tri - critical point in order to expose it and in this way confirm its conceptual relevance .",
    "in contrast , through this study we learned that we can in cecu@xmath1ge@xmath1 precisely access a tri - critical point by tuning two non - thermal parameters namely field and angle at very low temperatures .",
    "hopefully , such a tunability might allow us to unambiguously unveil a quantum tri - critical point .",

    "<S> in the zero temperature limit , the zero - point quantum fluctuations of certain degrees of freedom ( or quantum criticality ) is claimed to describe the collective fluctuations of systems undergoing a second - order phase - transition . to date , some of the best studied examples of quantum phase - transitions , and concomitant anomalous physical behavior , involve @xmath0electron magnetism in heavy - fermion metals , where quantum criticality ( qc ) is ascribed to either the suppression of a spin - density wave ( sdw ) ground - state or the kondo - effect . </S>",
    "<S> here , we unveil evidence for a quantum phase - transition in cecu@xmath1ge@xmath1 which displays both an incommensurate spin - density wave ( sdw ) ground - state , and a strong renormalization of the quasiparticle effective masses ( @xmath2 ) due to the kondo - effect . for _ all _ angles @xmath3 between an external magnetic field ( @xmath4 ) and the crystallographic @xmath5axis , </S>",
    "<S> the application of @xmath4 leads to the suppression of the sdw - state through a 2@xmath6-order phase - transition at a @xmath7dependent critical - field @xmath8 leading to the observation of small fermi surfaces ( fss ) in the paramagnetic ( pm ) state . for @xmath9-axis , these fss </S>",
    "<S> are characterized by light @xmath2s pointing also to the suppression of the kondo - effect at @xmath10 with surprisingly , _ no _ experimental evidence for quantum - criticality ( qc ) . </S>",
    "<S> but as @xmath4 is rotated towards the _ </S>",
    "<S> a_-axis , these @xmath2s increase considerably becoming undetectable for @xmath11 between @xmath4 and the _ c_-axis . around @xmath12 t </S>",
    "<S> the resistivity becomes @xmath13 which , coupled to the divergence of @xmath2 , indicates the existence of a field - induced qc - point at @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> this observation , suggesting fs hot - spots associated with the sdw nesting - vector , is at odds with current qc scenarios for which the continuous suppression of _ all _ relevant energy scales at @xmath15 should lead to a line of quantum - critical points in the @xmath16 plane . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that the complexity of its magnetic phase - diagram(s ) makes cecu@xmath1ge@xmath1 an ideal system to explore field - induced quantum tricritical and qc end - points . </S>"
