    "perturbative qcd describes the short - distance interactions of quarks and gluons and can be applied to the description of hadronic reactions on account of factorization theorems .",
    "more precisely , one can calculate systematically perturbative kernels and associated anomalous dimensions that govern the evolution of hadron distribution amplitudes ( das ) .",
    "these das parameterize hadronic matrix elements of quark - gluon currents and have to be determined by nonperturbative methods or extracted from experimental data .",
    "recently , schmedding and yakovlev @xcite have presented an analysis , based on light - cone qcd sum rules ( lcsr ) proposed earlier by khodjamirian @xcite and taking into account @xmath6-corrections , of the high - precision cleo experimental data @xcite that allows to extract quite restrictive constraints on the first two gegenbauer coefficients @xmath1 and @xmath2 which control the @xmath7-dependence of the pion distribution amplitude ( @xmath8da ) . this sort of analysis was further extended and refined by us in @xcite with the aim to take more properly into account nlo evolution effects of the @xmath8da , to treat threshold effects of the effective strong coupling , and to estimate more carefully contributions resulting from ( unknown ) higher - twist effects . in addition , we derived directly from the cleo data estimates for the inverse moment of the @xmath8da , which is compatible with that obtained from an _ independent _ qcd sum rule , referring in both cases to the same low - momentum scale of the order of 1  gev@xmath9 .    the results of our analysis , presented here , lead to the conclusion that the chernyak  zhitnitsky model @xcite for the @xmath8da in the plane @xmath10 is outside the @xmath5-level , while the asymptotic da , is excluded at the @xmath4 level .",
    "in fact , the data seem to prefer end - point - suppressed das as those we have previously determined using qcd sum rules with nonlocal condensates @xcite .",
    "these conclusions are further supported by contrasting the above mentioned @xmath8das with the e791 dijet data @xcite following the convolution approach of braun et al .",
    "moreover , it was found @xcite that the cleo data are sensitive to the value of the average vacuum quark virtuality , limiting its value close to @xmath11  gev@xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath8da is a central object in the deeper understanding of the pion microscopic structure in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom within qcd .",
    "this amplitude is defined by the matrix element of a nonlocal axial current on the light cone : @xmath13 where gauge - invariance is ensured due to the fock ",
    "schwinger string @xmath14 and @xmath15 is symmetric with respect to @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) and is normalized to unity , whereas @xmath18 denotes the normalization scale . fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] visualizes the light - cone structure of the @xmath8da .",
    "there are also 6 pion das at twist-4 level , four of them contributing to the @xmath19-transition as a twist-4 correction , whose value is parameterized by the scale @xmath20 .",
    "in what follows we will speak mainly of the twist-2 @xmath8da and for the sake of brevity we will omit its superscript @xmath21 referring to it simply as @xmath22 .    due to vector current conservation",
    ", the solution of the erbl evolution equation  @xcite ( in lo approximation ) in the asymptotic limit is @xmath23 . a particularly convenient way to represent",
    "the @xmath8da is to use its 1-loop eigenfunctions , viz .",
    ", the gegenbauer polynomials  @xcite : @xmath24_{\\xi\\equiv 2x-1}\\ ] ] with @xmath25 being the gegenbauer polynomials and the ellipsis denoting still higher - order eigenfunctions than displayed . in this representation",
    "all the dependence of @xmath26 on @xmath18 is concentrated in the coefficients @xmath27 due to the fact that the 1-loop evolution kernel has a factorized structure @xmath28v_0(x , x')$ ] . in the nlo approximation",
    "the eigenfunctions of the evolution kernel inevitably depend on @xmath29 and therefore on @xmath18 .",
    "note that because of the symmetry in @xmath30 , only even gegenbauer polynomials contribute .",
    "the high precision of the cleo data provides the possibility to extract these important theoretical parameters ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) directly from experiment .",
    "but before we turn to this subject , let us first give some brief exposition of the theoretical method to determine the @xmath8da within the qcd sum - rule approach .",
    "to model the nonlocality of the qcd vacuum , we assume @xmath31 , and similar expressions for other nonlocal condensates ( nlcs ) , where a single scale parameter @xmath32 was introduced in order to characterize the average momentum of quarks in the qcd vacuum  @xcite : @xmath33 the correlation length @xmath34 fm @xmath35-meson size represents the width of the nlc at small distances . let us mention that for very large distances ( @xmath36 fm  @xcite ) one may assume another form of the condensate , given by  @xcite @xmath37 at @xmath38 ( with @xmath39 ) .",
    "this behavior is of no importance in the problem under investigation .",
    "in @xcite we have determined all coefficients up to order @xmath40 using qcd sum rules with nonlocal condensates .",
    "it turned out that all coefficients beyond @xmath41 are very small so that for practical purposes it suffices to model the @xmath8da using only @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "so , the nlc qcd sum rules produces a whole bunch of self - consistent 2-parameter model das ( see fig .  2a . ) at @xmath42 : @xmath43\\ ] ] with the best - fit model ( bold - faced on fig .",
    "2a ) defined by the parameters @xmath44 the admissible regions for the parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 of the @xmath8da are presented in fig .",
    "2b as shaded slanted rectangles and are shown for different values of @xmath45 .",
    "2a demonstrates the most striking feature of our type of @xmath8das : their end - points ( i.  e. , @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) are strongly suppressed , the suppression being controlled by the quark vacuum virtuality @xmath45 .",
    "both the asymptotic and the cz @xmath8das are _ not _ end - point suppressed , as we have quantitatively shown in  @xcite .",
    "our models demonstrate by a precedent that the common statement _ `` two - humped @xmath8das are end - point concentrated '' _ is wrong .",
    "for @xmath49 , pqcd factorization does not help because it is valid only for leading twist and therefore higher twists become important  @xcite .",
    "@xmath46{fig - pi2g_h.eps}~~     \\includegraphics[width=0.49\\textwidth]{fig - pi2g_s.eps}\\ ] ]    the reason for this failure can be understood by recalling that if @xmath50 , one needs to take into account the interaction of a real photon at long distances of the order of @xmath51 , as the following fig .",
    "3 illustrates . to account for long - distance effects in a perturbative qcd treatment",
    ", one needs to introduce the light - cone da of a real photon .    to this end",
    ", khodjamirian  @xcite has shown that light - cone qcd sum rules ( lcsr ) effectively account for the long - distance effects of a real photon by using quark - hadron duality in the vector channel and an appropriate dispersion relation in @xmath52 ; namely , @xmath53ds",
    "+ \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int_{s_0}^{\\infty }      \\frac{\\rho(q^2,s)}{s+{q^2}}ds\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is an effective threshold in the vector channel and the borel parameter @xmath55 takes values in the range @xmath56 gev@xmath9 .",
    "then , the real photon limit ( @xmath50 ) becomes safely accessible .",
    "here @xmath57 includes contributions from both the leading twist @xmath8da as well as the twist-4 one .",
    "the latter is characterized by the twist-4 scale parameter @xmath58 .",
    "this theoretical ground was extended by schmedding&yakovlev ( sy ) to the nlo accuracy  @xcite .",
    "in  @xcite we improved the sy analysis based on lcsr ( [ eq : lcsr ] ) by taking into account erbl nlo evolution for the @xmath8da and the exact nlo running of @xmath59 .",
    "the established relation @xmath60 has been also involved in the analysis . as fig .",
    "4a shows , we obtained reasonable agreement with established in this approach constraints just for the value of @xmath11 gev@xmath9 .",
    "more recently  @xcite , we have refined this extensive analysis in several respects , notably , by obtaining from the cleo data direct estimate for the inverse moment of the @xmath8da that plays a crucial role in pion electromagnetic / transition form factors and by verifying the reliability of the main results of the cleo data analysis quantitatively .",
    "we also refined our error analysis by taking into account the total uncertainty of the twist-4 contribution and treated the threshold effects in the strong running coupling more accurately .",
    "the main upshot of this investigation is presented graphically in fig .  4b , where the values @xmath61 and @xmath62 have been employed .",
    "one can see that even with a 20% uncertainty in the twist-4 contribution , the cz distribution amplitude ( ) is excluded  at least  at the @xmath5-level , while other well - known models ( , and ) with shapes more or less close to the asymptotic one ( ) are excluded at the @xmath63-level .",
    "these findings are further supported by extracting the inverse moment of the @xmath8da from the cleo data in a two - gegenbauer model , @xmath64 , at the low scale @xmath65 gev@xmath9 .",
    "the obtained constraints are presented in fig .",
    "one should compare them with the theoretical model - independent estimate of the inverse moment @xmath66 , obtained in the special nlc qcd sum rule using again @xmath61  @xcite , see fig .",
    "noteworthily , these constraints match each other and both of them comply with the value @xmath67 found in  @xcite from a lcsr analysis of electromagnetic pion form factor . from fig .",
    "5b it is evident that again both the asymptotic @xmath8da and the cz model are far outside the region of the cleo experimental data .",
    "@xmath68{fig2-rev.eps}\\ ] ]",
    "the fermilab group e791 proposed  @xcite to exploit experimentally the ideas on dijet diffractive dissociation suggested in  @xcite and further developed in  @xcite .",
    "braun et al .",
    "@xcite have used a convolution - type approach to account for hard - gluon exchanges , represented diagrammatically in the left part of fig .",
    "6 .      following this convolution procedure",
    "( having also recourse to @xcite ) , and ignoring the distortion of our predictions caused by the detector acceptance , we found the results displayed in the right part of fig .",
    "6 , making evident that , though the data from e791 are not that sensitive as to exclude other shapes for the pion da ( asymptotic and cz model ) , also displayed for the sake of comparison , they are relatively in good agreement with our predictions .",
    "especially , in the middle @xmath7 region , where our @xmath8das  the shaded strip  has the largest uncertainties ( see fig .",
    "2a ) , the predictions are not in conflict with the data .",
    "however , before this data set can be used for a quantitative comparison , its inherent uncertainties have to be removed .",
    "it is again worth emphasizing that because our model distribution amplitudes  exemplified by the bms model  are end - point suppressed ( see fig .",
    "7 ) , they are not affected by the poor accuracy of the e791 experimental data in these regions .",
    "@xmath70{fig - cz - as - bms_b.eps}\\ ] ]",
    "thanks to the recent high - precision cleo experimental data  @xcite , we can answer more questions of nonperturbative qcd than a couple of years before . on the theoretical side , the method of qcd sum rules with nonlocal condensates  @xcite provided a tool to determine more precisely than before a bunch of candidate das for the pion that are endpoint - suppressed due to a rather large qcd vacuum quark virtuality @xmath45 . on the other hand ,",
    "the method of light - cone sum rules  @xcite enables us to access the pion - photon transition form factor when one photon becomes real . taking these theoretical approaches in conjunction",
    ", we were able to analyze the cleo data at the nlo level in order to derive restrictive constraints on the first two gegenbauer coefficients @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which control the @xmath7-dependence of the @xmath8da .",
    "these parameters allow the reconstruction of the @xmath8da and can be further tested against other experimental data , like those collected in the dijet production fermilab experiment e791 .",
    "the main conclusion is that both the cz model as well as the asymptotic @xmath8da are excluded  at least at the 2@xmath71 level  by the cleo data , while the two - humped end - point suppressed bms distribution amplitude with a value of @xmath72 is in a good agreement with the cleo data and not in contradiction with the e791 data .",
