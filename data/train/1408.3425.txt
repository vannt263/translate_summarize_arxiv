    "the photodoping of a mott insulator provides a relatively simple way to induce and study a nonequilibrium phase transition .",
    "if a laser pulse with a frequency larger than the mott gap is applied , doublon - hole pairs are produced , and these mobile carriers lead to a metallic response of the photodoped mott insulator.@xcite the changes in the optical conductivity associated with this metallization have been studied experimentally using time - resolved spectroscopy . in the pioneering work by iwai and collaborators on a ni - chain compound,@xcite a drude peak in the conductivity",
    "was measured promptly after the photodoping pulse , and the metallic state was found to last for a few picoseconds .",
    "alternatively , photoemission spectroscopy can be employed as a probe of the metallized mott insulator , as was shown for 1t - tas@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite    one can distinguish two mechanisms which play a role in the relaxation of photo - doped carriers : on the one hand , electron - electron scattering can lead to a thermalization of the electronic subsystem at a hot `` electron temperature '' , and on the other hand , carriers can dissipate their initially high kinetic energy through scattering with  external \" degrees of freedom such as spins or phonons .",
    "a large body of theoretical work on photodoped mott insulators has focused on the latter relaxation processes involving the scattering with spins in an antiferromagnetic background@xcite or the coupling to phonons.@xcite in this paper we assume that electron - electron scattering is the fast mechanism , so that we can study the thermalization of isolated electrons and neglect the aforementioned energy loss processes which affect the dynamics only on longer times ; limits of this assumption will be discussed in more detail below .",
    "generally , this assumption is valid if the electron - phonon coupling strength is weak and if there are no spin correlations , e.g. , due to a high temperature or large fluence .    in metals , a rapid thermalization of the electronic system",
    "is typically observed and underlies the assumption that a quasi - equilibrium picture or two temperature model@xcite can be used for describing the dynamics already at very short times after an excitation . in an insulator ,",
    "the thermalization and relaxation involves an adjustment in the number of electron - hole pairs , which can be a slow process in the presence of a large gap .",
    "it was found that in a purely electronic model ( a paramagnetic hubbard model with on - site repulsion @xmath1 ) the thermalization time depends exponentially on the gap size , and that even the relaxation of the distribution of photodoped carriers within the hubbard bands can be extremely slow.@xcite the explanation for this is relatively simple .",
    "if the energy @xmath1 which is needed for the production of a single doublon - hole pair is substantially larger than the typical kinetic energy of a single doublon or hole , complicated multi - particle scattering processes are needed for thermalization  hence the exponential scaling with @xmath1.@xcite for a similar reason , the doublon - hole recombination via emission of magnons @xcite or phonons @xcite becomes slow when the gap is large .",
    "if the kinetic energy of the charge carrier ( doublon or hole ) is larger than the size of the mott gap , it is energetically allowed to create an _ additional _ doublon - hole pair via two - particle scattering .",
    "we will call such processes  impact ionization \" , in analogy to similar processes in semiconductors@xcite and atoms.@xcite since a large excess kinetic energy is needed , one may anticipate a strong dependence of the relaxation dynamics on the pulse energy ( for a fixed interaction or gap size ) .",
    "in particular , we may encounter a situation where photo - doped doublons inserted at the upper edge of the upper hubbard band trigger a rapid increase in the number of charge carriers through impact ionization , while for doublons inserted at the lower band edge , the kinetic energy is not sufficient for impact ionization , so that the doublon - hole production depends on rare multi - particle scattering events .",
    "since impact ionization processes have the potential to rapidly enhance the number of mobile carriers in the photo - induced metal , an understanding of this physics is crucial for possible applications of photo - induced metal - insulator transitions in ultra - fast switches , or for the efficient operation of photovoltaic devices .",
    "for example , impact ionization allows to create multiple doublon - hole pairs per photon and hence to overcome the schockley - queisser limit for the efficiency of solar cells.@xcite    in this paper we focus on the paramagnetic mott - hubbard insulator with a relatively small gap , and study in more detail the electronic thermalization processes , with the goal of disentangling the fast impact ionization channel from doublon - doublon scattering and slower multi - particle scattering processes .",
    "as we will show , impact ionization can be identified experimentally by characteristic signatures in the time - resolved photo - emission spectrum , and in particular its energy and fluence dependence : ( i ) impact ionization can increase the number of doublons on the 10 fs time scale , and thus result in a rapid spectral weight increase of up to a factor of three above the fermi level .",
    "( ii ) while the photoemission spectral weight at high energies decreases as a function of time , it increases more than proportionally at energies which are lower by at least the size of the gap .",
    "( iii ) the frequency of the pump pulse needs to be larger than twice the gap ; below this threshold impact ionization is not possible .",
    "( iv ) since impact ionization involves only a single doublon or hole this process does not depend strongly on the density of photo - doped carriers ( or the fluence ) , while doublon - doublon and higher order scattering processes will become more frequent if the density of photo - induced carriers increases .",
    "we investigate and quantify the effect of impact ionization by considering a hubbard model @xmath2 with on - site interaction @xmath1 comparable to the bandwidth .",
    "the operators @xmath3 create an electron at site @xmath4 with spin @xmath5 , and the hopping amplitude is @xmath6 .",
    "the model is solved on an infinite - dimensional hypercubic lattice using nonequilibrium dynamical mean field theory ( dmft)@xcite with a strong - coupling perturbative impurity solver ( non - crossing approximation , nca).@xcite this lattice has a gaussian density of states , @xmath7 , and we use the width @xmath8 as our unit of energy . to simulate the photo - doping pulse",
    ", we apply a few - cycle electric field pulse of the form @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the body - diagonal of the lattice .",
    "we use a gauge without scalar potential , so that the field is given by the time derivative of the vector potential @xmath12 , @xmath13 . using the peierls substitution",
    ", the field then enters the hamiltonian via a time - dependent shift of the dispersion , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the fourier transform of the hopping matrix . for details of our implementation of the nonequilibrium dmft equations , the treatment of the electric field and the nca impurity solver , we refer to refs .   and .",
    "the double occupation at time @xmath16 , @xmath17 , is a local observable which can be obtained directly from the solution of the effective impurity model .",
    "since we use a strong - coupling impurity solver , @xmath18 is simply the occupation of the pseudo - particle state corresponding to doubly occupied sites.@xcite because @xmath19 is nonzero already in the initial mott state due to virtual charge fluctuations , the number of photo - excited doublons at a later time @xmath16 is given by the difference @xmath20 .",
    "this number can also be obtained spectroscopically , by integrating the photoemission spectrum over the upper hubbard band ( see below ) .",
    "the relaxation dynamics of photo - doped carriers depends crucially on whether or not the mott insulator is antiferromagnetically ordered.@xcite in the present study , we restrict the calculations to paramagnetic photodoped mott insulators at elevated temperatures .",
    "the temperature considered in this paper , i.e , @xmath21 , is well above the highest dmft nel temperature , @xmath22.@xcite since dmft overestimates @xmath23 , we can be certain that also paramagnons are not important .",
    "this is also supported by recent non - equilibrium cluster dmft calculations @xcite which , for the 2d hubbard model , showed that short - ranged spin - correlations have an important effect on the relaxation dynamics only below @xmath24.@xcite ( for higher - dimensional lattices , the effect of short - range correlations in the paramagnetic phase can be expected to be even smaller . )",
    "for the purpose of orientation we first plot the equilibrium spectra for different values of @xmath1 and inverse temperature @xmath25 ( fig .  [ equilibrium ] ) .",
    "the gap opens at @xmath26 and then grows approximately linearly with @xmath1 . in the insulating phase ,",
    "the shape of the hubbard bands is almost independent of @xmath1 , and they have a width of about @xmath27 . since an impact ionization process involves the scattering of a doublon at the upper edge of the upper band to the lower edge and a simultaneous doublon - hole excitation , it already becomes clear from the equilibrium spectra that we can only expect these processes to be relevant for interactions @xmath28 . for larger @xmath1 values ,",
    "the energy associated with scattering between states within the band is not enough to excite electrons across the gap . in the following",
    "we will thus focus on the interaction range @xmath29 .     +    for @xmath30 and @xmath31 , the time evolution of the photo - doped doublon density @xmath32 after pulses with frequencies in the range @xmath33 is plotted in the top panels of fig .  [ doublon_rate ] . here and in the following , we examine the change of double occupation with time , @xmath34 . for a better comparison between different band gaps and pulse energies ,",
    "the amplitude @xmath35 of each pulse has been adjusted such that at @xmath36 , shortly after the pulse , the density of photo - doped doublons is @xmath37 , and we normalize the curves by this initial density .",
    "we see that during the thermalization process , the number of doublons increases , i.e. , excess kinetic energy of the photo - doped carriers is transformed into interaction energy",
    ". the thermal reference value can be calculated by measuring the energy @xmath38 injected into the system by the pulse . here",
    ", @xmath39 is the current , with @xmath40 and @xmath41 . by comparing the total energy after the pulse to that of an equilibrium system",
    ", we can compute the temperature @xmath42 and double occupancy which the system will reach , assuming thermalization , in the long - time limit .",
    "the thermal values of the double occupancy are indicated by the dashed horizontal lines in fig .",
    "[ doublon_rate ] .",
    "if we fit the doublon curves in the range @xmath43 to a single exponential @xmath44 we obtain the relaxation times @xmath45 plotted in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ doublon_rate ] , and the long - time values @xmath46 indicated by the arrows in the top panels . for @xmath47 ,",
    "this extrapolated thermalized double occupation @xmath46 is smaller than its actual thermal value ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ doublon_rate ] ) .",
    "hence , we can conclude that at least two relaxation mechanisms are at work .",
    "we also note that the relaxation times @xmath45 are much faster than previously observed electronic thermalizations of doublons @xcite and strongly pulse - energy dependent : with increasing pulse frequency , the initial growth of the doublon population becomes faster , see upper right and lower panel of fig .",
    "[ doublon_rate ] .",
    "all of this suggests that the fast doublon production is due to impact ionization , which requires that the excess kinetic energy of the photo - doped carriers is larger than the gap .",
    "once all carriers with large kinetic energy have decayed , this contribution disappears and the long - time thermalization dynamics is controlled by slower multi - particle scattering processes . in previous studies ,",
    "this was the only relaxation mechanism , since the pulse energy was too small ( relative to the gap ) for impact ionization .    in order to show direct evidence for impact ionization , we plot in fig .",
    "[ doubling ] time resolved photoemission spectra @xcite @xmath48 for a gaussian probe pulse envelope @xmath49 , which we cut off for @xmath50 .",
    "choosing @xmath51 , and a pump - pulse lasting up to @xmath36 , this means that for @xmath52 , there is no overlap between pump and probe pulse anymore .",
    "a pulse width of @xmath53 allows to measure the relaxation of the system with an energy resolution @xmath54 .",
    "let us first focus on the left panels , which show results for interaction @xmath55 , pulse amplitude @xmath56 and pump pulse frequency @xmath57 .",
    "this pump pulse inserts the doublons at the upper edge of the upper hubbard band . as time increases , the spectral weight near the upper band edge decreases , while the weight near the lower band edge starts to grows .",
    "( up to a constant off - set , the total weight in the upper hubbard band reproduces @xmath20 to high accuracy . )",
    "since the energy difference between the upper and lower band edge is larger than the gap size in this example , impact ionization processes can be expected to play a role in the initial relaxation dynamics .    that these processes are indeed to a large extent responsible for the doublon production follows from the lower panel , which plots the difference between the photoemission spectrum at time @xmath16 and the measurement at time @xmath58 .",
    "spectral weight decreases with increasing time for @xmath59 , with the fastest decrease measured at energy @xmath60 ( indicated by an arrow in fig .",
    "[ doubling ] ) . from the lower band edge up to @xmath61 , we see an increase in spectral weight , with the fastest doublon production at energy @xmath62 .",
    "impact ionization can now be identified by analyzing the number of doublons produced per decay of a high energy doublon .",
    "let us consider the process of a high energy doublon creating a doublon - hole pair ( doublon@xmath63 @xmath64 doublon@xmath65 + doublon@xmath65 + hole@xmath65 ) , and its symmetric counterpart ( hole@xmath63 @xmath64 hole@xmath65 + hole@xmath65 + doublon@xmath65 ) .",
    "the net effect is the production of _ three _ low energy doublons per decay of a high energy doublon .",
    "therefore , if impact ionization were the only relevant process on the timescale of fig .",
    "[ doubling ] , we would expect that the increase in the number of low energy doublons would be three times larger than the decrease in the number of high energy doublons .",
    "computing the integrals over the positive and negative parts of the curves displayed in the bottom panel ( red shaded areas ) , we find a ratio of @xmath66 .",
    "this indicates that besides the impact ionization processes , there are also doublon conserving scattering processes which contribute to the redistribution of spectral weight within the hubbard band .",
    "we will discuss some key differences between these two relaxation channels , and how they affect the time - resolved photoemission spectra , in the section on the fluence dependence ( sec .",
    "[ subsec - fluence ] ) .",
    "a second observation is that the ratio in the positions of the maxima of the gain and loss peak is approximately @xmath67 .",
    "a tempting interpretation would be to say that in an impact ionization process the shift of occupied spectral weight within the upper hubbard band from @xmath68 to @xmath69 is associated with a transfer of occupation between the hubbard bands from @xmath70 to @xmath69 ( scattering process indicated by the arrows in the upper panel ) .",
    "however , in contrast a band insulator the first moment of the occupied density of states in mott insulators does not equal the total energy , so that the aforementioned redistribution of occupied weight would not be energy - conserving .",
    "doublon - hole excitations lead to a reconstruction of the density of states and hence a redistribution of weight over a larger @xmath71 region . here",
    "we will not analyze this effect in detail , but instead focus on the evolution of the spectral weight averaged over large energy regions ( high and low energy doublons ) .",
    "the right hand panels of fig .",
    "[ doubling ] show analogous results for @xmath72 , pulse amplitude @xmath56 and pulse frequency @xmath73 .",
    "while the absorption is smaller in this case , the parameters are still compatible with impact ionization .",
    "indeed , as shown in the lower panel , the change in the spectral function is fastest near the energies @xmath74 and @xmath75 , which satisfy @xmath76 .",
    "the low - energy hump is however broader , and the ratio between the red areas is only @xmath77 , which suggests a larger role of doublon - doublon and doublon - hole scattering processes in this case .      at least in cases such as",
    "the set - up discussed above , where the high - energy and low - energy carriers can be relatively clearly separated , one can try to reproduce the time evolution of the doublon population with a simple model that describes the decay of the high - energy doublons via impact ionization with a relaxation time @xmath78 , and the higher order scattering processes with a different associated thermalization time @xmath79 .",
    "we denote the slow processes with a subscript  therm \" and the fast ones with  imp \" and split the total doublon number @xmath32 into a high - energy and low - energy population @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "after thermalization , we assume that only low - energy doublons are present , and denote their number by @xmath82 .",
    "the time evolution is then given by the equations @xmath83 and @xmath84 , where we assume the simple rate equations @xmath85 the factor of three in eq .",
    "accounts for the production of three low energy - doublons per decay of a high - energy doublon ( hole ) in an impact ionization process , as explained above .",

    "[ twostep_doping ] shows the corresponding time evolution of the doublon concentration , normalized at @xmath96 .",
    "the results for amplitudes smaller than 2 all collapse onto a single curve .",
    "this shows that in the initial stage of the relaxation , the doublon - hole production becomes independent of the doping concentration - a result consistent with a time evolution which is dominated by impact ionization . to see that the slow timescale is indeed more strongly dependent on fluence , we plot in the lower panel the difference to the thermal value , @xmath97 on a logarithmic scale . to extract the two relaxation times @xmath78 and @xmath79 , we performed fits of the dmft data with model ( [ model ] ) and @xmath91 .",
    "the slow timescale @xmath79 increases from about 50 to about 200 as the pulse amplitude is lowered from 6 to 0.25 , while the fast timescale increases from about 10 to about 20 ( tab .  [ table_doping ] ) . for pulse amplitudes smaller than 2 ,",
    "i.e. in the small doping regime , the fast timescale becomes essentially independent of the doping concentration , while the slow timescale shows no sign of saturation and continues to increase with decreasing doping concentration .",
    "( also the relative high - energy population , @xmath98 , increases . )",
    "the estimated value of @xmath99 implies that the initial fast increase of the doublon population evident in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ twostep_doping ] is due to impact ionization .",
    "one also finds a fluence dependence in the time - resolved photoemission spectra .",
    "if the bandwidth , gap size and pump - pulse energy are compatible with impact ionization , then these processes dominate the doublon production and redistribution of spectral weight if the density of carriers is small . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec_pulse_freq ] , a characteristic signature in the photoemission spectrum is an increase in spectral weight at an energy @xmath69 near the lower band egde , and a simultaneous decrease at an energy @xmath68 , where about three low - energy doublons are produced per high - energy doublon .",
    "this behavior is clearly evident for pulses with small amplitude in fig .",
    "[ pes_amplitude ] .",
    "the top panel shows results for @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "for the blue curve ( @xmath100 ) , the area under the positive hump near the lower band edge is @xmath101 times larger than the area under negative hump at high energies .",
    "for the green curve ( @xmath102 ) it is @xmath77 time larger .",
    "this means that for each doublon which disappears at high energy , more than two doublons are created at low energy , and thus we conclude that most of the doublons appearing near @xmath69 are produced by impact ionization .",
    "a similar result is also displayed in the lower panel ( @xmath103 , @xmath73 ) , where for the smallest pulse amplitude ( @xmath104 ) we see two well - defined peaks with @xmath76 .    with increasing fluence , the low energy hump broadens , which means that doublons appear at energies in the middle of the band , which are no longer compatible with impact ionization .",
    "they are instead the result of scattering processes between high - energy and low - energy doublons ( or holes ) which conserve the number of carriers .",
    "the red curve in the upper panel of fig .  [ pes_amplitude ] , which corresponds to @xmath105 , and the green curve in the lower panel ( @xmath106 ) show that these processes become relevant already at a doublon density of @xmath107 . in these simulations ,",
    "the area under the low - energy hump is about a factor of 2 larger than the area under the negative hump , which indicates that for each impact ionization process @xmath108 we have approximately also one scattering between a high energy and a low energy doublon ( or hole ) , @xmath109 . because the scattering probability of the latter process is proportional to the carrier concentration",
    ", it can dominate the redistribution of spectral weight at even larger fluence ( see red curve in the bottom panel ) .",
    "we note that deviations from the universal low - fluence evolution of the relative doublon concentration also appeared for doping concentrations larger than @xmath107 ( see fig .",
    "[ twostep_doping ] and tab .  [ table_doping ] ) .",
    "thus our analysis of the photoemission spectra supports the interpretation that the universal curve is entirely controlled by impact ionization , while the slower increase of the relative doublon population seen for larger fluence is the result of competing scattering processes which deplete the high energy population .",
    "in this study , we considered the thermalization dynamics after a photo - doping pulse in a purely electronic model without magnetic order . for a photo - excited mott insulator , it is instructive to distinguish relaxation processes ( i ) within the hubbard band ( which keep the number of doublon - hole pairs fixed ) and ( ii ) relaxation processes across the mott gap ( which change the number of doublon - hole pairs ) .",
    "the simplest relaxation process of type ( i ) is electron - electron scattering , which here is a doublon - doublon , hole - hole or doublon - hole scattering .",
    "it keeps the number of doublons and holes fixed but transfers energy from one doublon ( hole ) to another .",
    "this process requires a second doublon ( or hole ) , and hence the corresponding relaxation rate of a carrier will be proportional to the number of doublons ( holes ) .",
    "such processes redestribute the energy among the doublons ( holes ) but do not change the doublon number .    in order to change the number of doublons , type ( ii ) processes",
    "are needed .",
    "again the simplest process is electron - electron scattering which in this case corresponds to impact ionization : a doublon ( or hole ) excites an electron across the mott gap , creating an additional doublon - hole pair . from one doublon",
    ", we obtain two doublons and one hole . if we also consider the symmetric process for holes , impact ionization leads to a three - fold increase in the number of doublons and holes .",
    "these processes do not involve other doublons ( or holes ) but the doublon kinetic energy must exceed the size of the mott gap . if the doublon energy is not large enough , only less likely multi - scattering events can thermalize the number of doublons .",
    "we have discussed the characteristic signatures of impact ionization in situations where the pulse energy is large and the gap is small , as in fig .  [ doubling ] : in this situation the photo - excited high - energy doublons create additional doublon - hole pairs so that the number of doublons almost triples , and a second peak develops in the photoemission spectrum at an energy corresponding to about 1/3 of the photo - excited high - energy peak .",
    "our data analysis based on the model eqs .",
    "( [ model1])-([model3 ] ) assumed that the high - energy doublon population @xmath80 decays only via impact ionization and gives a good fit in these cases .",
    "we also find that impact ionization is fast for a mott insulator . for a bandwidth @xmath8 of the order of 1  ev , corresponding to a unit of time of 0.66  fs , the fast relaxation times in tab .",
    "[ table ] are of the order of 5 - 70 fs .",
    "we have also seen that processes of type ( i ) have the potential to prevent impact ionization by lowering the doublon energy before impact ionization occurs .",
    "doublon - doublon scattering processes become more important when the number of doublons is large ( fig .",
    "[ pes_amplitude ] ) . in this case",

    "mott gaps are of the order of 1 ev so that phonons and magnons have a lower energy and can hence only contribute to type ( i ) processes . but",
    "as discussed above , this has the potential to prevent impact ionization . in a mott insulator with strong electron - phonon coupling ,",
    "the cooling rate associated with electron - phonon scattering can be of the same order of magnitude as impact ionization.@xcite for most systems electron - phonons relaxation occurs however only on the 0.1 - 1ps time scale , which means that these processes are slower than the observed impact ionization in a mott insulator .",
    "this is completely opposite to the behavior in semiconductors , where impact ionization has a much larger time scale than electron - phonon scattering.@xcite for semiconductors , electron - phonon coupling hence prevents impact ionization altogether .    even in a purely electronic system",
    ", additional relaxation processes may come into play . at low temperature , in the magnetically ordered phase",
    ", spin - flip scattering provides a particularly efficient dissipation channel , which can lead to a fast redistribution of spectral weight within the hubbard bands .",
    "exact diagonalization based studies of the motion of a single carrier in an antiferromagnetic background suggest that the excess kinetic energy of a photo - doped carrier is transferred to the spin background within a few hopping times,@xcite and recent dmft studies of photodoped antiferromagnetic mott insulators revealed a very fast cooling of the photo - carriers.@xcite also in the vicinity of an antiferromagnetic phase , short - range spin correlations provide an efficient scattering mechanism,@xcite whereas in one dimension the energy transfer to the spin system seems to be inefficient.@xcite    in a model which takes into account the absorption of excess doublon kinetic energy by phonon or magnon scattering , we have a reduction of the high - energy population @xmath80 and a corresponding increase of the low - energy population @xmath81 .",

    "the efficient dissipation of kinetic energy and the associated rapid decrease in the high - energy population in an antiferromagnetic system is expected to have a significant effect on the thermalization dynamics in small gap mott insulators .",
    "it reduces the effectiveness of the impact ionization process , leads to a slower adjustment of the doublon population , and thus a slower electronic thermalization . in the present work ,",
    "we have chosen however a high temperature where spin correlations are reduced , so that impact ionization can be more clearly identified .",
    "our results should also be relevant at higher fluence , independent of magnetic ordering , because in this case the photo - doping leads to a rapid melting of antiferromagnetic correlations.@xcite",
    "the main finding of this study is that in situations where the gap - size is smaller than the width of the hubbard bands , the kinetic energy of the photo - doped particles can be large enough that impact ionization processes play an important role in the initial relaxation .",
    "in fact , for the largest interactions considered ( @xmath72-@xmath116 ) , the doublon - hole production on the computationally accessible timescales is almost entirely due to impact ionization processes .",
    "we have demonstrated this by analyzing the time - resolved photoemission spectrum , and by extracting the impact - ionization and thermalization timescales from fits to a model with two exponentials , which was found to provide a rather good description of the time evolution of the doublon density .",
    "these timescales depend on the gap size , with the slow timescale ( related to higher order scattering processes ) growing much more rapidly with gap size than the fast one ( related to impact ionization ) , while the pulse frequency mainly affects the relative population of high - energy carriers which can trigger impact ionizations .",
    "the two timescales also exhibit a different dependence on the pulse amplitude ( or density of photo - doped carriers ) : impact ionization process are insensitive to the doping concentration in the small - doping regime , while the slow timescale grows rapidly with decreasing fluence . for higher photo - doping ,",
    "impact ionization can be masked and suppressed by doublon - doublon scattering .",
    "impact ionization may be relevant for mott solar cell applications . in the case of conventional semiconductor solar cells ,",
    "the coulomb interaction is weak so that interaction scattering ( impact ionization ) can hardly excite an electron across the semiconducting gap , i.e. , create an additional electron - hole pair .",
    "impact ionization only occurs on time scales of 1 - 100 ps , @xcite which is much longer than the typical time scales of 0.1 - 1 ps for electron - phonon scattering .",
    "hence , for a conventional semiconductor , almost all the excess kinetic energy of photoinduced carriers is transferred to lattice vibrations ( heat ) .",
    "consequently , for each photo - excited electron - hole pair only the gap size is harvested as an electrical energy quantum , independent of the energy quantum of the photon .",
    "this severely restricts the efficiency of semiconductor solar cells to about @xmath117 , known as the schockley - queisser limit.@xcite to overcome this limit , solar cell quantum dots , e.g. , based on pbse nanocrystals , where larger coulomb interactions and phonon - bottlenecks effects can enhance impact ionization have been proposed.@xcite also for mott insulators the possibility of impact ionization has been discussed based on fermi s golden rule calculations for the hubbard model.@xcite    in our paper we have shown that impact ionization in a mott insulator can occur on time scales of the order of 10 fs , i.e. , much faster than typical electron - phonon relaxation times .",
    "impact ionization processes are efficient only in mott insulators with a small gap relative to the width of the hubbard bands .",
    "this is quite difficult to realize for a one - band hubbard model .",
    "however in multi - band hubbard models or in charge - transfer insulators , the size of the gap can be much smaller than the width of the hubbard and charge transfer bands , respectively . whether or not impact ionization",
    "can contribute significantly to the power produced by mott solar cells such as the recently proposed lavo@xmath118-based heterostructure@xcite remains an open question . to address this issue one would have to consider a realistic set - up , and also study the diffusion of the photo - doped carriers to the leads,@xcite the effect of the spin background,@xcite and the coupling to phonons.@xcite in any case , our study has shown that impact ionization in mott insulators",
    "can be fast and can contribute effectively to the production of carriers .",
    "hence , mott insulators have a potential to overcome the schockley - queisser limit , by harvesting more than the gap energy per photon .",
    "this class of materials can thus be expected to play an important role in the future development of highly efficient solar cells .",

    "<S> we study the influence of the pulse energy and fluence on the thermalization of photo - doped mott insulators . </S>",
    "<S> if the mott gap is smaller than the width of the hubbard bands , the kinetic energy of individual carriers can be large enough to produce additional doublon - hole pairs via a process analogous to impact ionization . </S>",
    "<S> the thermalization dynamics , which involves an adjustment of the doublon and hole densities , thus changes as a function of the energy of the photo - doped carriers and exhibits two timescales : a fast relaxation related to impact ionization of high energy carriers and a slower timescale associated with higher - order scattering processes . </S>",
    "<S> the slow dynamics depends more strongly on the gap size and the photo - doping concentration . </S>"
