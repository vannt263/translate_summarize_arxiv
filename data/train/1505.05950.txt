    "the vorticity distribution at any instant of time determines both the current state of the flow and its future evolution , for given boundary conditions .",
    "this property holds for any hamiltonian system , and it can indeed be shown that the dynamics of vortices can be usefully expressed in hamiltonian form . in the vorticity and stream function formulation of an ideal incompressible planar fluid ,",
    "the evolution of the vorticity distribution @xmath0 is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the vorticity , @xmath3 is the stream function , and @xmath4 is the laplace operator .",
    "the corresponding @xmath5 components of the eulerian velocity field are given by @xmath6    if one is willing to view the vorticity @xmath7 as a distribution , one can consider point vortex solutions .",
    "in particular , point vortices are obtained if one considers the vorticity solution ansatz @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the dirac delta distribution centered at the point @xmath12 at a given time @xmath13 .",
    "substitution of this ansatz into yields the following well known finite dimensional system in the form of hamilton s canonical equations , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the green s function for the planar laplacian .",
    "a point - vortex approximation to a continuous distribution of vorticity for euler s fluid equations is problematic , though , because a point vortex induces a flow velocity which becomes unbounded .",
    "however , when the point vortex is made smooth and bounded ( regularized ) the approximation becomes reasonable @xcite .",
    "for example , one may consider the regularized form of the vorticity equation given by choosing a translationally and rotationally invariant smoothing kernel @xmath16 of width @xmath17 and defining the regularized vorticity as @xmath18 while continuing to use to evolve @xmath7 in time .",
    "for example , @xmath19 is considered in @xcite . in this case",

    "vortex blob_. this system is the starting point for the vortex blob method , introduced in @xcite ( albeit with a different regularization ) .",
    "the economy of the vortex blob method derives from the property that dirac delta distributions are hyper - local ( i.e. parametrized by position ) , and the property that the vorticity equation admits dirac delta distributions as solutions",
    ". however , there are many distributions which are localized to a similar degree ( e.g. derivatives of delta functions , @xmath24 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we study the more general vorticity solution ansatz , @xmath25 we find that this ansatz yields a closed finite dimensional system which generalizes vortex blobs .",

    "vortex blob_. stochastic perturbations were further included to model viscosity @xcite . these adjustments to the classical point vortex method yielded the _ vortex blob method _ , which quickly became of practical use for realistic fluid flow modeling .",
    "in particular , the regularized system proved more amenable to error analysis .",
    "it was shown that the solutions of the vortex blob method converge to solutions of the navier - stokes equations in @xcite .",
    "later , stronger convergence rates were achieved by judicious choice of vortex kernels . by convolving the singular vortex kernel with sums of gaussian smoothing kernels ,",
    "a sequence of vortex blob kernels with faster convergence rates was found .",
    "specifically , the convergence rate of the @xmath28th kernel was found to be of order @xmath29 for any @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a grid - spacing parameter and @xmath17 is a length scale associated to the smoothing kernel @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , the symplectic geometry of point vortices was clarified in @xcite by invoking arnold s interpretation of ideal fluids @xcite .",
    "the findings of @xcite were developed further in @xcite to handle fluid flow on manifolds with nontrivial homology .",
    "while this theoretical development clarified the geometry of point vortices , vortex blobs were sometimes thought to be a numerical  trick \" which violated the geometric interpretation .",
    "however , this thought was banished with the invention of the euler-@xmath32 model , a regularized model of ideal fluids with a parameter @xmath32 representing the typical correlation length of fluctuations away from the mean of a lagrangian fluid path @xcite . in particular ,",
    "vortex blob solutions associated to a specific kernel serve as _ exact _ solutions to the euler-@xmath32 model @xcite .",

    "a comparison of the euler-@xmath32 kernel to the @xmath33 kernel of @xcite is given in @xcite for vortex filament and vortex sheet motion .",
    "while vortex blobs performed well , they did not capture all of the qualitative richness observed in fluid vorticity dynamics .",
    "in particular , blobs of vorticity in real ideal fluids are known to change shape and deviate from initially circular distributions .",
    "a numerical method is proposed in @xcite to capture these shape dynamics by adding basis functions with non - trivial moments in the study of vortex merger ( see for example @xcite ) . another distinct model obtained by projection onto a hermite basis",
    "is described in @xcite .",
    "this projection yielded a finite - dimensional systems which modeled the ( truncated ) moments of the vorticity of an ideal incompressible fluid .",
    "the derivation of simplified combinatorial formulas invoked by the dynamics of this model were discovered in @xcite and these formulas have made the method numerically tractable for a large number of moments .",
    "a dual approach to the moment based methods of the previous paragraph @xcite is to consider multipole based methods .",
    "this is the approach proposed in @xcite , where an initial vortex ansatz consisting of sums of distributional derivatives of dirac delta distributions is considered .",
    "such an idea has occured intermittently in various forms in the literature , over many years .",
    "for example , a regularized vortex blob model , in the spirit of @xcite , which considered vorticity distributions of the form @xmath34 was investigated in @xcite .",
    "here it was proven that this augmentation of the traditional vortex method will yield faster spectral convergence than that of a traditional vortex blob method .",
    "the current article considers higher order derivatives and can be seen as a natural follow up to @xcite .",
    "more recently , dynamics have been derived for interactions of pure vortices and pure dipoles .",
    "these come from vorticity distributions of the form @xmath35 with the assumption that the locations of the dipoles and the vortices never overlap and that their self - interaction terms may be neglected @xcite . in a different approach ,",
    "approximations of dipoles are created by holonomically constraining vortices of opposite strength to be a fixed distance from one another , @xcite .",
    "the question remains , however , to what extent the dynamics of @xcite approximates those of @xcite after self - interaction terms have been neglected . in summary ,",
    "the removal of self - interaction terms is one of the primary obstacles to obtaining a multipole based generalization of the point vortex method @xcite .",
    "moreover , the spectral error decay rates found in @xcite arise from the use of vortex blobs in place of ( singular ) point vortices . in this article",
    "we will follow this regularization based approach .",
    "in this section we review a class of regularized fluid models and their relationship with vortex blob methods ( for a more detailed discussion see  @xcite ) .",
    "the sort of fluid models we consider take the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a @xmath38 invariant linear psuedo - differential operator with a length - scale parameter @xmath39 such that @xmath40 .",
    "when @xmath37 is just the identity , the above `` model '' is euler s equations of motion for an ideal fluid .",
    "when @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the laplace operator , then we obtain the the euler-@xmath32 model , the solutions of which will converge to solutions of euler s ideal fluid equations as @xmath43 vanishes @xcite .",
    "we may replace @xmath44 with its stream function , @xmath3 , in order to rewrite the above equations as @xmath45 this allows us to represent planar fluid dynamics in terms of scalar functions and distributions rather than vector - fields .",
    "the relationship between these regularized models and vortex blobs methods comes from first considering the point - vortex ansatz @xmath46 if the operator , @xmath47 , has a non - singular green s function , @xmath48 , then substituting the ansatz into implies that @xmath49 we should note that when @xmath50 is the identity ( i.e. for an euler fluid ) , then @xmath48 is singular , and an extra argument ( perhaps a physical one ) must be presented in order to allow the resulting singular velocity fields . in this paper",
    "no such issues with singularity arise because we are modelling an euler fluid with a regularized fluid where @xmath37 has a non - singular green s function .",
    "substitution of @xmath3 into then implies the following equations of motion for the vortex cores @xmath51 and the strengths @xmath52 : @xmath53 when @xmath54 and @xmath55 this is nothing but the point - vortex method . when @xmath39 it is possible for @xmath3 to be much more regular , and we obtain various vortex - blob methods .",
    "in particular , we obtain the smooth vortex blobs of  @xcite .",
    "it is notable that and together form a finite dimensional ode .",
    "the solutions of this ode are _ exact _ solutions to the regularized fluid model . again , this is valuable because the solutions of many regularized fluid models have been shown to converge to solutions of the ideal fluid equations as @xmath32 vanishes .",
    "this paper seeks to generalize these point - like solutions to regularized fluid models to obtain a richer class of solutions with richer conservation properties .",
    "in this section we derive the equations of motion for the time - dependent parameters which specify multipole vortex blobs ( mvbs ) .",
    "the zeroth order mvbs are just standard vortex blobs and the resulting equations of motion are those of the standard ( non - stochastic ) vortex blob algorithm @xcite .",
    "the first order mvbs are regularized dipoles and the equations of motion are those of @xcite . here",
    "we will derive the equations of motion for @xmath56th order mvbs following the approach of @xcite .    consider the ansatz for the vorticity , @xmath57 for spatially constant dynamical variables @xmath58 for @xmath59 where @xmath60 is some countable set .",
    "the stream function is @xmath61 the corresponding velocity field is given by @xmath62 examples of the types of velocity fields produced are depicted in figures [ fig : zero ] through [ fig : second ] on page .",
    "we seek equations of motion for the @xmath63 s and @xmath64 s such that the velocity field satisfies the vorticity equation . in the following calculations",
    ", we will not show the explicit time dependence of the dynamical variables .",
    "we now find @xmath65 and @xmath66 by invoking of appendix [ sec : distributions ] we can rearrange the previous equation to obtain @xmath67 similarly , we find @xmath68 substitution of these expressions into yields the vanishing of a linear combination of the distributions @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "since each of these distributions is linearly independent of the others ( assuming the @xmath71 s are distinct ) , their individual coefficients must each vanish independently .",
    "if we focus on the terms of the sum where @xmath72 we obtain coefficients for @xmath73 and @xmath74 at the core locations .",
    "the vanishing of these coefficients yields the dynamics for mvb cores @xmath75 the vanishing of the coefficient of @xmath76 yields @xmath77    for @xmath78 the vanishing of the coefficient of @xmath79 yields @xmath80 \\partial_{m-\\ell+1,n - k+1 } \\psi(z_i ) \\label{eq : gamma dynamics } \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we observe that @xmath81 depends on @xmath3 at the vortex cores @xmath82 , and the vortex core dynamics depend on @xmath3 as well . fortunately , we already found that @xmath3 is purely a function of @xmath83 and @xmath82 , as stated in .",
    "thus and ( with ) form a closed finite dimensional system .",
    "most notably , by construction the vorticity equation admits the @xmath56th order mvb ansatz for the vorticity in as a solution when the @xmath64 s and the @xmath84 s satisfy the just derived finite dimensional system .    in the point vortex method ( i.e. the un - regularized case where @xmath55 ) , this derivation of the dynamics requires an extra step .",
    "in particular , one must discard the self - interaction term , which we will describe here . for point vortices , @xmath2 . substituting the point - vortex ansatz @xmath85 into the equations of motion",
    "would then yield the non - sensical equation @xmath86 we say `` non - sensical '' because the right hand side explodes when you evaluate the @xmath87th term in the sum , the self - interaction term .",
    "historically , it is customary to discard this self - interaction term based on physical and symmetry principles ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 4 ) .",
    "in contrast , for blob methods the logarithmic kernel is replaced with a differentiable kernel function , such as a gaussian .",
    "this allows one to retain the self - interaction terms . in the case of standard vortex blobs ( i.e. 0th order mvbs )",
    ", this distinction makes no difference because the gradient of the kernel vanishes at the origin and the self - interaction term contributes nothing to the dynamics .",
    "however , the derivatives of the kernel of degree @xmath88 and higher do not vanish at the origin . as a result",
    ", the self - interaction terms do contribute to the dynamics for mvbs of order @xmath88 and higher .",
    "the choice to discard the self - interaction terms in @xcite , versus our choice to keep them , explains one of the major discrepancies between our work and @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite was concerned with generalizing the ( un - regularized ) point vortex method in the same way that we have generalized the vortex - blob method .",
    "once the ansatz @xmath89 was substituted into the equations of motion , they discarded the self - interaction terms in order to handle the singularities in the velocity field .",
    "they had no other choice . except for the initial regularization step we took ,",
    "this discarding of the self - interaction term is the primary place where the derivation of the equations of motion presented here diverges from the derivation in@xcite . discarding the self - interaction term in @xcite lead to contradictory compatibility equations for singularities of degree @xmath88 and higher .",
    "this is one regime where the self - interaction terms have an impact on the dynamics in our regularized formulation .",
    "one of the major findings of @xcite was that one could avoid these contradictory compatibility conditions by limiting one s self to combinations of point - vortices and dipoles . even in this limited scenario ,",
    "our equations of motion do not match even in a regularized sense , as the vortex cores of the dipoles are not advected by the ( singular ) velocity field in @xcite .",
    "additionally , as the regularization parameter goes to @xmath90 in our framework , the velocity fields become singular , and the equations of motion for the @xmath91 s will explode .",
    "so we can not expect to observe any form of convergence to the finite valued odes of @xcite .",
    "in this section we begin to touch upon some of the symplectic geometry of mvbs .",
    "to begin , let us consider a general vorticity distribution @xmath7 .",
    "the energy is defined as @xmath92 where @xmath93 .",
    "the vorticity equation , , can be seen as an instance of hamilton s equations on a poisson manifold . in this case",
    "the poisson manifold is the space of vorticity distributions , and the poisson bracket is the vorticity poisson bracket derived in @xcite . as the hamiltonian is conserved by hamilton s equations , we should expect @xmath94 to be constant in time . indeed , we find that if @xmath7 satisfies , then @xmath95 by integration by parts , we can remove the partial derivates from the @xmath7 s to find @xmath96 which vanished by the equivalence of mixed partials .    as is a hamiltonian system , we can consider searching for symmetries to find other conserved quantities using noether s theorem .",
    "we ve relegated the discussion of the relevant symplectic structure to appendix [ sec : symmetries ] , where derivations and proofs of the following can be found . here",
    "we can summarize the appendix .",
    "it s simple to observe that the hamiltonian @xmath97 is translation invariant , and that @xmath97 is rotationally invariant as long as the kernel @xmath98 has rotational symmetry .",
    "thus we should expect there to be conserved quantities tied to these symmetries .",
    "we find that the quantities @xmath99 are conserved .",
    "the relationship between these quantities and the symmetries of the system is explained in appendix [ sec : symmetries ] .",
    "alternatively , one can observe the conservation of these quantities by direct calculation in the same way that conservation of energy was verified .",
    "as the mvb ansatz is consistent with we can substitute the mvb ansatz into the above conserved quantities , to obtain conserved quantities for the mvb evolution , and .",
    "we obtain the following conserved quantities : @xmath100 again , the first two quantities , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , are momenta derived from noether s theorem for the rotational and translational symmetries of the fluid .",
    "the quantity @xmath97 is the kinetic energy of the fluid . in section [ sec : symplectic ]",
    "we will characterize the mvb dynamics as hamiltonian systems , with hamiltonian @xmath97 .",
    "to each individual mvb there are numerous conserved quantities which can be seen as a manifestation of the conservation of circulation . to show this , let @xmath103 be a time - dependent vector field which satisfies .",
    "the flow of @xmath104 is the diffeomorphism , @xmath105 , which sends particle labels at time @xmath90 to their positions at time @xmath106 .",
    "if @xmath107 is the vorticity at time @xmath106 then @xmath108 is constant in time .",
    "this conservation law can be seen as a corollary of kelvin s circulation theorem @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the quantity @xmath109 is constant in time for any @xmath110 . by applying the change of variables formula and invoking the incompressibility condition , @xmath111 , we find @xmath112 this form of writing @xmath113 makes sense when @xmath107 is a distribution . as a result",
    ", we find that for a vorticity of the form the quantity @xmath114 is conserved for any @xmath110 .",
    "while this conservation law holds for all functions with compact support , @xmath115 , we do not obtain infinitely many conserved quantities when @xmath107 satisfies the mvb ansatz and @xmath60 is finite .",
    "this is because the expression on the right hand side only depends on the @xmath56th order taylor expansion of @xmath115 at @xmath116 , as is illustrated by the fa di bruno formula .",
    "we will not display the fa di bruno formula here because it requires nearly a page of notational definitions before to writing it down @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , by computing the cardinality of jet spaces , one would obtain @xmath117 independent conserved quantities as a result of .",
    "these conserved quantities can be interpreted as a finite dimensional manifestation of the conservation of circulation .",
    "in this section we present how the moments of the vorticity distribution evolve in time .",
    "we will find that when the vorticity distribution is that of a mvb , then the moments form a closed dynamical system at finite order .    the @xmath118 moment of the vorticity , @xmath7 , centered around the vortex position @xmath119 is given by @xmath120 we call the integer @xmath121 the _ order _ of the moment .",
    "for a general vorticity , the evolution for the @xmath122th order moments will depend on the @xmath123th and higher order moments and so we can not concoct a closed dynamical system for the moments of order @xmath122 and less .",
    "however , this is not the case if @xmath7 satisfies the mvb ansatz , and the points @xmath124 are given by the locations of the jet - vortices .",
    "if @xmath7 satisfies the mvb ansatz then @xmath125 for @xmath126 and @xmath59 .",
    "given the points @xmath127 , one can write the moments in terms of the circulation strengths , the @xmath91 s . for the moment @xmath128 with @xmath126 with @xmath129 we may invert this relationship to write @xmath130 , i.e. as a function of the moments",
    ". invoking the motion equations for the @xmath91 s and substituting the relation between the @xmath91 s and the @xmath131 s yields a closed dynamical system for the @xmath131 s .",
    "this relation between the @xmath91 s and the @xmath131 s may also be important in the context of plasma physics , especially when one recalls that can be interpreted as a one - dimensional plasma model .",
    "specifically , phase - space moments of the vlasov probability distribution form an important dynamical link between lagrangian - particle and eulerian - continuum descriptions .",
    "the phase - space moments of the vlasov probability distribution provide _ collective coordinates _ for the hamiltonian dynamics of ensembles of particles . for more explanation of this property of hamiltonian collectivization of the phase - space moments ,",
    "see @xcite . in plasma dynamics , the phase - space moments arise from a taylor expansion of the vlasov particle distribution , taken around its centroid in phase space .",
    "for planar incompressible flow of an ideal fluid , the phase space comprises the @xmath5 lagrangian coordinates of a fluid particle , and the corresponding moments arise from taylor expansions around the centroid of the ( smooth ) vorticity distribution .",
    "the duality between the resulting spatial moments of a smooth vorticity distribution and the mvbs corresponding to higher - order singular vorticity distributions also obtained from a taylor expansion raises the intriguing question of finding a relation between these two types of dynamical description .",
    "this question is particularly intriguing because the dynamics of moments beyond quadratic order in general does not close to form a finite - dimensional hamiltonian system , while the dynamics of mvbs closes at every order .",
    "there exist other systems for approximating the dynamics of moments which differ from the one presented here .",
    "in particular , the equations of motion for the moments here form a closed system at order @xmath56 , whereas other methods for deriving dynamical systems for moments @xcite require truncations in order to form a closed system .",
    "for example , @xcite approximates the stream function as a sum of hermite functions with evolving centroids and weights . in order to obtain the evolution for the weights and the centroids they project the viscous vorticity equation onto this space via @xmath132 projection .",
    "the resulting formulas are explicit and efficient to compute , albeit more complex than the formulas found in this paper . the primary source of error for @xcite over long times is the discrepancy between the projected evolution equations and the true evolution equations . in contrast , we approximate an euler fluid with a regularized fluid equation which we solve exactly .",
    "this is not to say that error is not accumulated in time .",
    "the primary source of error for our method over long times is the discrepancy between between the regularized fluid equations and the true fluid equations .    admittedly , the equations of motion for the moments in @xcite bear some resemblance to the equations of motion for the @xmath91 s in our method .",
    "both are quadratic in their respective variables , with coefficients involving combinatorial functions .",
    "a more precise relationship , if one exists , is difficult to discern .",
    "philosophically , the methods share much in common . however , due to the fundamental approximation technique of projecting the equations of motion versus regularizing them , the methods are indeed distinct .",
    "this difference cascades throughout the study of both methods .",
    "for example , the convergence for @xcite is obtained via the convergence of spectral approximations , while the convergence of our method is a corollary of the convergence of a regularized fluid model ( see @xcite for such convergence proofs ) .",
    "in this section we discuss various numerical aspects of using mvbs to model fluid dynamics .",
    "we will observe how mvbs can be used to reduce the number of necessary pairwise computations without a drastic compromise in accuracy .",
    "we will also present an algorithm for constructing an initial condition of mvbs from a given stream function .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a convergence proof and error analysis of the 1st order case .",
    "a convergence proof is beyond the scope of this article .",
    "suffice it to say , such a proof would likely resemble @xcite .",
    "let us consider the vorticity distribution @xmath133 if @xmath134 and @xmath135 are close , we can define the quantities @xmath136 and @xmath137 to obtain the approximation @xmath138 where @xmath139 .",
    "therefore the distribution @xmath140 with @xmath141 serves as a @xmath142 approximation of @xmath7 in the sense of distributions .",
    "moreover , the stream function @xmath143 is an @xmath142 approximation of @xmath144 in the traditional sense of analysis on functions .",
    "we have just described the first case of grouping two @xmath56th order mvbs concentrated at @xmath134 and @xmath135 into a single @xmath145th order mvb concentrated at the average position @xmath146 .",
    "more generally , we can consider the ansatz @xmath147 and observe @xmath148 the above computation implies that the quantity @xmath149 serves as an @xmath142 approximation of @xmath7 .",
    "of course , this again implies that the corresponding stream functions are approximated to order @xmath150 as well . note that @xmath151 is concentrated above a single point , @xmath146 , while @xmath7 is concentrated above two points .",
    "such reductions are even more dramatic when considering higher order jets .",
    "in particular , @xmath152 zeroth order mvbs can be approximated with a single @xmath56th order mvb by applying the above approximations iteratively .",
    "the computation of pairwise interactions in the vortex method was once a major bottleneck in implementing the standard vortex method for real - world applications .",
    "it was not until the invention of the fast multipole method , that it became tractable to compute millions of pairwise interactions by reducing the complexity from an @xmath153 calculation to an @xmath154 calculation , where @xmath122 is the number of vortices @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of viscous fluids with boundaries , vorticity is shed from the boundaries . as a result , the vortex blob method of @xcite created new vortices at the boundary by using the kutta condition as a creation criteria . for these applications",
    ", @xmath122 will grow in time without bound , and some means of discarding vortices must be invoked .",
    "it is here that the grouping of mvbs could be useful .",
    "if one merges two @xmath56th order mvbs to obtained a @xmath145th order mvb , the amount of scalars and data typically increases .",
    "so one must still make a tough decision as to what data to discard ( e.g. through some tolerance or by simply truncating at level @xmath155 ) .",
    "nonetheless , the analysis presented here could shed light on how best to implement this approach .",
    "the merging of blobs of vorticity has been studied analytically @xcite and numerically @xcite , as well as in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "all of this study has been in the slightly viscous ( or nearly inviscid ) regime . the grouping approach discussed here",
    "can be used to numerically resolve such collision events . in theory , there is no issue with collisions because we are considering regularized vortices where the induced velocity field from a single mvb is always finite .",
    "however , as @xmath156 becomes smaller , the velocity near the vortex core diverges",
    ". this should be of concern as the convergence analysis of the vortex method pre - supposes that @xmath157 .",
    "typically such a near collision is handled by using a smaller time - step ( as the ode is quite stiff ) .",
    "grouping of mvbs suggests an alternative by avoiding this pair - wise interaction altogether .",
    "perhaps such an approach could be viewed as a variation of the punctuated dissipation events described in @xcite where an initial vorticity distribution is found to asymptotically approach a smoother axisymmetric vortex blob , and discrete vortex mergers are implemented to model this behavior .",
    "there are qualitative questions which arise from mergers .",
