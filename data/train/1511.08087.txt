    "angus et al . ( 2015 ) have recently considered a novel test of mond .",
    "they used thirty disc galaxies studied by the diskmass survey ( bershady et al .",
    "2010a , 2010b ) , which measured rotation curves , surface - density profiles for gas , and brightness distributions for stars , as well as profiles of velocity dispersions vertical to the galactic disc , @xmath1 . for these galaxies , angus et al . performed a rotation - curve analysis based on mond , . ] fitting for the best value of the k - band , stellar mass - to - light ratio , @xmath9 .",
    "these @xmath10 values agree with those determined from population - synthesis , as was also shown in earlier mond rotation - curves studies ( see , e.g. , figure 28 of famaey & mcgaugh 2012 ) .",
    "then , using these @xmath10 values , and the diskmass light and gas distributions , they calculated the predicted mond profiles of the vertical velocity dispersions , call them @xmath0 .",
    "this was done numerically , using the qumond version of nonrelativistic mond ( milgrom 2010 ) .",
    "we can schematically summarize the procedure they use by a relation of the form ^2_m(r)=q(r)h_z_b(r ) , which captures the correct interrelations between quantities . here",
    ", @xmath11 is the baryonic disc surface density , gotten from the k - band light surface density combined with the above mond , best - fit @xmath10 ( plus the gas contribution ) , @xmath12 is `` the '' scale height , assumed @xmath5-independent , and not directly measured , but determined from @xmath13 correlations deduced from the photometry of ( other ) edge - on galaxies ( @xmath14 is the measured scale length ) .",
    "the @xmath5-dependent factor @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the constant that would appear in newtonian dynamics ( @xmath17 depends on the velocity distribution ) , and , @xmath18 is the mond correction .",
    "this @xmath2 is then the dispersion _ of the test - particle population whose scale height is being used .",
    "_    the exact mond correction depends on the mond formulation assumed ( e.g. , milgrom 2014b ) , and has to be calculated numerically for realistic discs . in the nonlinear poisson theory of bekenstein and milgrom ( 1984 ) , and in the qumond formulation ( milgrom 2010 ) used by angus et al . ( 2015 ) , the correction is given approximately ( for thin discs ) by _",
    "m(r)1/ , where @xmath19 is the local rotational speed , @xmath20 is the mond acceleration constant , and @xmath21 is the relevant mond interpolating function ( milgrom 1989 , 2001 ) .    then , @xmath0 are compared with the dispersion profile , @xmath1 , measured and published as part of the diskmass project .",
    "this is a test of mond , different from , and independent of , rotation - curve analysis , although it is rather more dependent on the specific mond theory assumed .    the fault with mond that angus et al .",
    "claimed was as follows : if one uses in eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) @xmath10 from the mond rotation - curves analysis , and @xmath12 from @xmath13 correlations for edge on galaxies , then the ratio ( r)_m(r)/(r ) , which ideally should be 1 is , in fact , systematically larger than 1 ( by about a factor of 1.4 on average ) .    to me , the prime suspect cause for this discrepancy is the inadequacy of the diskmass dispersions @xmath3 .",
    "i have suggested to angus et al . that these are too low for the purpose they were used in the diskmass applications and by angus et al .",
    "this is because @xmath3 , which was derived from the line widths of integrated light , may be more strongly weighted by younger populations  which have smaller dispersions  while the k - band light distributed is more heavily weighted by old stars  which have higher dispersions and larger scale heights .",
    "i also suggested to conduct a detailed analysis of the vertical column in the milky way near the sun , where the separation can be made , to assess the strength of this systematic error .",
    "such an analysis has just been published by aniyan et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , with results that support the above suspicion .",
    "the correction factor they found for the solar column ",
    "@xmath3 being too small by a factor of @xmath22  if it applies on average to the diskmass galaxies , would bring the predicted mond dispersions to remarkable agreement with the measured ones in both shape and magnitude .",
    "[ reev ] , i discuss all these issues in more detail .",
    "[ disc ] contains a brief general comment on possible lessons .",
    "looking at the @xmath23 comparisons of angus et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , in their figures 14 - 17 , we note first that the predicted mond profiles , match , rather well , the @xmath1 profiles _ in shape_. in other words , @xmath24 defined in eq . ( [ iii ] ) is well consistent with being nearly @xmath5-independent , while @xmath3 and @xmath2 separately are , generally , strongly @xmath5 dependent . for reasons discussed below , this , in itself , is _ a highly nontrivial accomplishment of _ mond  not discussed by angus et al .",
    "( 2015 ) .    to bring this out more clearly , i plot in figure [ fig1 ] , the mond predictions , @xmath2 , on top of the diskmass data , corrected up by a factor , @xmath25 , chosen for each galaxy to get a good match `` by eye '' .",
    "we see that , indeed , but for the overall scaling , mond predicts the shapes of @xmath1 _ very well_.    , from angus et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , ( red line ) and the diskmass @xmath1 scaled up by a factor given in each frame for the 30 galaxies .",
    "the vertical turquoise line marks the bulge radius ; data to its left are `` unreliable '' , according to angus et al . ]",
    "the fault with mond pointed by angus et al .",
    "is then the fact that @xmath6 , which supposedly should be 1 , is systematically above 1 .",
    "more quantitatively , i find from figure [ fig1 ] that @xmath26 is between 1 and 1.7 .",
    "it has a mean @xmath27 , and a standard deviation @xmath28 .",
    "angus et al . also express this discrepancy [ equivalently , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) ] by stating that : `` ... to match the dms ( @xmath3 ) data , the vertical scaleheights would have to be ... a factor of 2 lower than those derived from observations of edge - on galaxies with a similar scalelength . ''",
    "the first culprit that came to my mind when first reading angus et al .",
    "( 2015 ) in preprint form , is well exposed in the following excerpts from my messages to them . for example",
    "( may 22 2015 ; a few misprints corrected ) :  regarding your recent paper : we know that stellar discs are made of various populations with very different z - dispersions and scale heights . starting from the gas disc and young stars with low dispersion and small scale height to old populations with both rather much larger .",
    "when conducting z - analyses in the milky way one is always careful to consider a test - particle population for which both the velocities and the z - distribution are used .    in your analysis ( and that of the diskmass people )",
    "all populations seem to be lumped together ; i.e. , the whole analysis is single component .",
    "is it not possible that the single velocity dispersion number you use is weighted differently by the different populations from the single number for the scale height .",
    "for example , if the dispersion is strongly weighted by young stars , but the light distribution from which the scale - height - scale - length relation is deduced ( in the other , edge - on galaxies ) is weighted by old stars you would get a mismatch of the type you find . should nt a proper z - analysis either be a multi - component one , or use the same population for both the distribution and the velocities of the test particles ?",
    "i looked only superficially , but you seem not to have discussed this issue .     and more ( may 23 ) : `` as i said , it only takes the sigmas you use to be 30 percent below the `` correct '' ones to produce a mismatch of a factor of 2 in the deduced scale height ... surely such small deviations could easily be produced by the procedure .",
    "the span in dispersions between different populations in the mw is much larger than this ( i think about a factor 3 ) ... one would have to take some model of a mixture of populations with their different dispersions , for example the mw populations , and look at what the line strengths are for the different types than integrate the line profiles and the photometry to see if we are comparing apples with oranges or not . in any event your paper should clearly explain all this and in particular make the point that the factor of 2 mismatch in @xmath12 really is traced back to a small difference in sigma . ''",
    "angus et al .",
    "have not accepted this view , do not discuss these potential systematics , and do not question the adequacy of the diskmass @xmath3 .",
    "instead , they concluded : `` thus , the most straight - forward way to reduce the model vertical velocity dispersions in mond is to decrease the stellar scaleheight .",
    "if these were reduced from the values derived from observations of edge - on galaxies by roughly a factor of 2 then the dms vertical velocity dispersions and rotation curves would be compatible with mond . regardless of stellar scalelength",
    ", these disks would have scaleheights between 200 and 400 pc . according to a two dimensional ks tests ,",
    "such thin disks are strongly at odds with observations . ''    on the contrary , there is evidence to support the suspicion that the diskmass @xmath3 values are underestimates of what needs to be used in eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) , and its newtonian analogue , in conjunction with light distribution based on the @xmath13 correlations and k - band photometry .",
    "we see from figure [ fig1 ] that we only need the diskmass @xmath3 to be 25 % too small on average ( @xmath29 ) , to make the mond predictions fully in agreement with the data .",
    "if , on the other hand , we accept the diskmass @xmath3 as `` correct '' in the above sense , the following incongruities with other deductions appear :    \\(i ) the resulting stellar @xmath10 values that diskmass collaboration deduced based on their @xmath1 ( in newtonian dynamics ) are lower by a factor of @xmath30 than those deduced from population - synthesis",
    ". they are also substantially lower than values of @xmath10 obtained by other means ( see , e.g. , mcgaugh & schombert 2014 and aniyan et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "\\(ii ) with these @xmath10 values , galactic discs would be strongly submaximal .",
    "namely , such discs would account for only a fraction of the observed rotational speeds at small radii  even in high - surface - brightness , high - rotational - speed galaxies .",
    "this would mean , in newtonian dynamics , that dark matter contributes substantially even near the centers of these galaxies .",
    "this is at odds with what is indicated by rotation - curve analysis ( for example that features in the disc mass distributions are faithfully reproduced in the rotation curves , while they would have been washed out by a dark - matter halo ) .",
    "\\(iii ) even more alarming , angus , gentile & famaey ( 2015 ) showed , more recently , that the procedure that has led to the published diskmass @xmath10 values was flawed , and , in fact , even overestimated @xmath10 .",
    "this is because even as they were , such low @xmath10s imply the present of dark matter _ in the disc itself_. thus , some of the `` disc '' dynamical mass determined from @xmath1 has to be allotted to the dark matter in the disc .",
    "the deduced stellar masses , and @xmath10 , are thus even smaller . with this correction ,",
    "the diskmass @xmath3s give @xmath10 values a factor of @xmath31 lower than population - synthesis values .",
    "recall that the mond @xmath10 values deduced from the rotation curves are consistent with population - synthesis values .",
    "angus , gentile & famaey ( 2015 ) list as one possible explanation of this disparity : `` alternatively , the measured stellar velocity dispersions of the diskmass survey might have been under - estimated by @xmath32 . ''",
    "\\(iv ) with the low @xmath10 values published by diskmass , and even more so with the correction of angus , gentile & famaey ( 2015 ) , the baryonic tully - fisher relation for predominantly - stellar disc galaxies would be substantially off that for gas - rich galaxies .",
    "all galaxies give a single , tight relation with @xmath10 values consistent with population - synthesis results .",
    "_ all of these incongruities disappear if @xmath3 given by diskmass are corrected up by a factor @xmath33 on average ( i.e. , if they are underestimates by @xmath8 on average ) . _    we can now understand why the fact that the mond @xmath0 match in shape the diskmass @xmath1 , in itself , very significant .",
    "namely , why this is quite unexpected if the dikmass @xmath3s , with their low @xmath10s , are `` correct '' , and dark matter were at play here , and not mond .    in the first place ,",
    "the mond correction , @xmath18 , is @xmath5- and galaxy - dependent .",
    "why then , if mond is not at action here , would @xmath18 distort the shape of @xmath0 in just the right way ?",
    "furthermore , in the dispersion plots of angus et al .",
    "one does not reach regions where the rotational acceleration @xmath34 , and so in these regions the mond correction only reach modest values , perhaps , up to @xmath35 in the outer regions studied for some of the galaxies .",
    "in fact , the disagreement ( in amplitude ) between @xmath2 and @xmath3 occurs also ( and largely ) in regions where @xmath36 .",
    "there , mond predicts no discrepancy ( i.e. a maximum disc situation ) , while the diskmass @xmath3s , with the small @xmath10 values they imply , predict large discrepancies ( highly sub - maximal discs )  even larger with the caveat of angus , gentile & famaey ( 2015 ) .",
    "if the latter were true , the dark - matter halo would have affected strongly both the rotation curve and the vertical disc dispersions ; _ and this in different and not directly related ways ; in ways that are also @xmath5- and galaxy - dependent _",
    ": for example , the dark matter would enter rotation curves through its integrated mass up to the radius in question , but enter the dispersion essentially only through its local density within the disc .",
    "also , the halo shape ( e.g. ellipticity ) enters the two in different ways ( see , e.g. , angus , gentile & famaey 2015 ) , etc .",
    "couple this with the fact , already mentioned , that mond does introduce a galaxy- and @xmath5-dependent correction factor of up to @xmath37 , it would be quite unexpected indeed if dark matter were responsible , and , with all the intricacies involved , mond were to reproduce everything correctly , but for a constant correction factor for @xmath3 .",
    "_ indeed , correcting the diskmass @xmath3s in a way that eliminates the above - listed incongruities would also make the mond predictions , @xmath0 , fully consistent with the observations , in ( average ) magnitude as well as in shape .",
    "_    now , aniyan et al .",
    "( 2015 ) have considered this issue of the inadequacy of velocity dispersions extracted from line profiles integrated over all populations .",
    "they suggest , indeed , that these may be underestimates relative to the representative ones , because they are weighted by young , cold populations that do not contribute much to the relevant light distribution .",
    "aniyan et al .",
    "conducted a detailed analysis of data for the vertical column at the sun s position in the milky way , where it is possible to separate the different populations .",
    "they find that using the integrated line profile underestimates the `` correct '' dispersion  that needed to conjoin dynamically with the light scale height  by a factor of @xmath38 .",
    "similar results were gotten when the besanon model of the galaxy was used .",
    "this is exactly the average correction needed to bring the predicted mond @xmath0 profiles of angus et al . to agreement with the diskmass data , as it corresponds to @xmath39 .",
    "this near coincidence may be somewhat fortuitous since in the sample studied by angus et al .",
    "there is a range of @xmath6 values between 1 and 1.8 . and , the correction factor found by aniyan et al .",
    "( 2015 ) is probably not universal .",
    "it may depend or @xmath5 within a galaxy , and differ between galaxies , due to variation in population mix , details of the velocity distributions of different populations , etc .",
    "in addition , both @xmath12 and @xmath10 , which were assumed @xmath5-independent in the analysis , may , in fact , depend somewhat on @xmath5 . on the other hand , the fact that @xmath24 is found remarkably @xmath5-independent may be telling us that while the error correction factor one needs to apply to the diskmass @xmath3 may depend on the galaxy , the assumptions of @xmath5-independent @xmath10 and @xmath40 are approximately valid .",
    "these assumptions are also supported by direct observations of edge - on galaxies and studies of color variations across galaxies .",
    "aniyan et al .",
    "( 2015 ) say they have embarked on a project to assess the correction factor at different radii , in external galaxies .",
    "note also that the @xmath13 correlation used by diskmass and by angus et al . for their adopted values of @xmath12",
    "is said to have a standard deviation scatter of 25 % in @xmath12 .",
    "this in itself produces an error of @xmath41 in the predicted @xmath2 , and can explain some of the scatter in @xmath6 that is found here .",
    "i conclude with another admonition i made to angus et al .",
    "( may 23 2015 ) which carries a more general lesson : `` the general problem is , that after the more clear - cut tests of mond , such as rotation curves , tully - fisher , etc .",
    ", one is now starting to look at rather more subtle tests with only small , and more theory - dependent predicted discrepancies ( @xmath42 ) , more roundabout astrophysical argumentations , with more iffy assumptions ( as in your case ) . in these",
    ", one then has to be extra careful , as any small slip will lead to failure . ''",
