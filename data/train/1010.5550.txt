    "massive stars with zero - age main sequence ( zams ) masses @xmath1 in the range of @xmath2 end their lives with the gravitationally induced catastrophic collapse of their electron - degenerate iron core to nuclear densities . there ,",
    "the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) stiffens and stabilizes the inner core , which overshoots its new equilibrium and bounces back , launching a hydrodynamic shock .",
    "the shock initially races through the still collapsing outer core , but soon stalls and turns into an accretion shock ( at @xmath3 km ) due to the dissociation of heavy nuclei at the shock front and neutrino losses from the postshock region @xcite .",
    "the shock must be revived to drive a core - collapse supernova ( ccsn ) and the precise nature of the responsible ccsn mechanism has been a topic of intense research for decades ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .    a neutron star ( ns ) is left behind by a ccsn that explodes soon after bounce and successfully unbinds its stellar mantle",
    ". however , a stellar - mass black hole ( bh ) may be the outcome : ( 1 ) if in a successful , but perhaps weak , ccsn fallback accretion pushes the nascent ns over its mass limit , ( 2 ) if nuclear phase transitions during protoneutron star ( pns ) cooling occur or if pns cooling reduces pressure support in a hyper - massive pns , or ( 3 ) if the ccsn mechanism lacks efficacy and fails to revive the shock and continued accretion pushes the pns over its maximum mass . in this last channel to a stellar - mass bh , there is no electromagnetic ( em ) signal other than the disappearance of the original star .",
    "it is such `` unnovae '' @xcite , failing ccsne , that are the topic of this paper .    in ordinary massive stars that hydrostatically form",
    "degenerate iron cores , bh formation , in any scenario , is never prompt ( e.g. ,  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is always preceded by an extended pns phase giving rise to copious emission of both neutrinos ( @xcite ) and gravitational waves ( @xcite ) until the pns is engulfed by the bh horizon . the em silence expected in a failed ccsn",
    "may be broken after all , if sufficient and appropriately distributed angular momentum is present to allow for a keplerian accretion disk to form near the bh , permitting a collapsar ( @xcite ) gamma - ray burst ( grb ) central engine to operate and drive relativistic outflows .",
    "it is currently unclear what fraction of massive stars form bhs and through which channel .",
    "preexplosion observations of progenitors of successful ccsne suggest progenitor masses @xmath4 @xcite for standard type ii - p supernovae .",
    "assuming , as suggested by @xcite , that most other ccsne fail or make bhs after a successful explosion , this would correspond to a bh fraction of @xmath5%-@xmath6% of massive stars above @xmath7 .",
    "however , alternative interpretations exist and have been summarized by @xcite",
    ". theoretical work by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite provided rough estimates on the outcomes of stellar collapse as a function of progenitor zams mass and metallicity . leaving effects due to binary evolution aside , @xcite performed an extensive study of fallback in artificially driven spherically symmetric ccsn explosions and estimated that zero - metallicity stars form bhs in @xmath8%-@xmath9% of all core - collapse events with an average bh mass of @xmath10 . for solar - metallicity stars , due to increased mass loss during evolution , @xcite found bhs to form at a significantly lower rate and initial mass .",
    "they predict bh fractions in the range of @xmath11%-@xmath12% with typical initial bh masses of @xmath13 .",
    "this is in rough agreement with previous population synthesis calculations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "early spherically symmetric ( one - dimensional , 1d ) simulations of bh formation in failing ccsne were carried out by @xcite and @xcite . @xcite performed a set of quasi - stationary 1d pns accretion and cooling simulations to investigate the possibility of bh formation in sn 1987a .",
    "delayed bh formation ( by tens of seconds ) , due to , e.g. , a nuclear eos phase transition , was studied by @xcite .",
    "more recently , 1d full boltzmann neutrino radiation - hydrodynamics calculations of failing nonrotating ccsne were carried out by @xcite and more recently @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these studies provided detailed neutrino signature predictions for bh - forming core - collapse events .",
    "however , owing to the complexity and computational expense of such boltzmann - transport calculations , these groups could consider only very limited sets of progenitor models and eos .",
    "simplified axisymmetric ( 2d ) simulations of bh formation in rotating core collapse were first performed in a series of papers by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these authors used simplified eos , no neutrino treatment , and artificially constructed initial conditions and found prompt bh formation .",
    "recently , the same authors performed a small set of 2d simulations with a finite - temperature nuclear eos and a leakage scheme for neutrinos @xcite and considered collapse , bh formation , and subsequent evolution in an artificially constructed progenitor with an iron core mass of @xmath14 and constant specific entropy of @xmath15/baryon , initial conditions that are inconsistent with those at the precollapse stage of ccsn progenitors .    in this paper ,",
    "our focus is on studying and establishing the systematics of failing ccsne and bh formation . for this",
    ", we employ the spherically symmetric general - relativistic ( gr ) open - source code ` gr1d ` @xcite that can handle rotation in an approximate angle - averaged way ( `` 1.5d '' ) and sacrifice accuracy in the neutrino treatment by employing an efficient energy - averaged three - species neutrino leakage / heating scheme instead of full transport .",
    "the efficiency of ` gr1d ` enables us to perform more than @xmath16 collapse calculations , investigating for the first time in detail the effects of variations in nuclear eos , progenitor zams mass and metallicity , neutrino heating efficiency , and precollapse rotational configuration .",
    "we employ four different finite - temperature nuclear eos and draw a total of 106 progenitor models from seven stellar evolution studies .    in section [ sec : methods ] , we review the features of our 1.5d gr hydrodynamics code ` gr1d ` , discuss our neutrino leakage / heating scheme , and introduce the set of employed eos . section  [ sec : initialmodels ] introduces our progenitor model set , numerical grid setup , and precollapse rotational setup . in section [ sec : fid ] , we introduce key aspects of failing ccsne and bh formation by discussing the evolution of bh formation in a fiducial nonrotating @xmath17 solar - metallicity progenitor .",
    "we go on in section [ sec : eosdependence ] to study the influence of the eos and thermal effects on the time to bh formation and on the maximum ( baryonic and gravitational ) mass of the pns .",
    "we discover that for nuclear eos with physically plausible stiffness , the maximum ( baryonic and gravitational ) mass of the pns is always greater than the corresponding cold ns mass and discuss that the difference is due entirely to thermal pressure support of material in the hot outer pns core .",
    "this effect is strongest for the softest considered eos and decreases with increasing eos stiffness . in section [ sec : prestruct ] , we analyze the impact of variations in progenitor structure on the time to bh formation and the maximum pns mass in failing ccsne .",
    "we find that the postbounce dynamics can be predicted rather robustly by a single parameter , the compactness of the progenitor structure at core bounce .",
    "the same approximate single - parameter dependence emerges in section [ sec : lums ] , where we determine the neutrino heating efficiencies required ( modulo ignored multi - dimensional effects ) to induce a neutrino - driven explosion in a large set of progenitors .",
    "the combined results of sections [ sec : prestruct ] and [ sec : lums ] allow us to make predictions on the outcome of core collapse for progenitors with varying zams mass and metallicity in section [ sec : evolution ] .",
    "as we discuss in that section , mass loss may be the greatest uncertainty in connecting zams parameters to core - collapse results . in section [ sec : rotatingbh ] , we present results from the first rotating bh formation simulations in the ccsn context .",
    "varying the precollapse rotation rate in section [ sec : parameterizedrotation ] , we find that , not unexpectedly , increased rotation leads to a delay of bh formation and greater maximum pns masses .",
    "we also observe that the birth spin of kerr bhs in nature appears to be robustly limited to values below @xmath18 by the likely appearance of nonaxisymmetric rotational instabilities that redistribute or radiate angular momentum .",
    "this finding requires confirmation by 3d simulations .",
    "we go on in section [ sec : grb ] to discuss the collapse evolution of a set of progenitors that were evolved from the zams with a 1.5d treatment of rotation and discuss their viability as collapsar - type long - grb progenitors .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusion ] , we critically summarize our work and conclude .",

    "this is common practice in stellar evolution codes ( e.g. , @xcite ) an has also been applied to newtonian 1d stellar collapse calculations  @xcite .",

    "note that , as may be expected and was demonstrated by @xcite , the 1.5d approximation becomes less accurate with increasing spin and quantitative results are reliable only for low rotation rates .",
    "neutrino effects are crucial in stellar collapse and should ideally be included via a computationally expensive gr boltzmann transport treatment ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , since our aim is to perform an extensive parameter study with hundreds of simulations , we choose to resort to a less accurate , but much more computationally efficient leakage and approximate heating scheme for neutrinos .",
    "details of this are laid out in @xcite . here",
    "we review only its most salient features .    before core",
    "bounce , neutrinos deleptonize the collapsing core , reducing the electron fraction @xmath55 and , as a consequence , the size of the homologous inner core @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the prebounce @xmath55 can be parameterized as a function of density and that this parameterization varies little between progenitor stars .",
    "we follow this prescription for prebounce deleptonization and use the @xmath56 fit parameters of his g15 model . following bounce",
    ", this simple parameterization becomes inaccurate and can not capture the effects of neutrino cooling , deleptonization , and neutrino heating .",

    "the heating rate at radius @xmath61 is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a scale factor that allows for artificially increased heating , @xmath64 is the neutrino luminosity interior to @xmath61 , @xmath65 is the optical depth , determined through the leakage scheme , @xmath66 is the energy - averaged absorption cross section , and @xmath67 is corresponding mass fraction of the neutrino reaction ( @xmath68 for @xmath58 capture on protons and @xmath69 for @xmath57 capture on neutrons ) .",
    "@xmath70 is the mean inverse flux factor which we approximate analytically as a function of the optical depth @xmath71 by comparing to the angle - dependent radiation transport calculations of @xcite .",
    "we include in our simulations the stabilizing effect of neutrino pressure in the optically thick pns core via an ideal fermi - gas approximation ( @xcite ) . leaving out this pressure contribution leads to @xmath72% smaller maximum gravitational pns masses .",
    "we also include terms due to neutrino pressure and radiation - field energy in the calculation of the gravitational mass ( equation  [ eq : mass ] ) and of the metric potential ( equation  [ eq : phi ] ) . since our leakage scheme does not treat neutrino energy separately from the internal energy of the fluid , including the energy of the neutrino gas in the former equations is not fully consistent with our present approach .",

    "the evaluation of @xmath103 at core bounce is crucial , since this is the only physical and unambiguous point in core collapse at which one can define a zero of time and can describe the true initial conditions for postbounce evolution .",
    "computing the same quantity at the precollapse stage leads to ambiguous results , since progenitors come out of stellar evolution codes in more or less collapsed states .",
    "collapse washes out these initial conditions and removes ambiguities .",
    "we point out ( as is obvious from table  [ tab : initialmodels ] ) that there is a clear correlation between iron core mass and bounce compactness . since the effective chandrasekhar mass increases due to thermal corrections @xcite , more massive iron cores are hotter .",

    "assuming ( quite likely ) uniform rotation of the pns core , the increase in maximum pns mass due to centrifugal support in the range of rotation rates explored is @xmath451%-@xmath452 . in the basic neutrino mechanism",
    ", rotation leads to a lower sum of @xmath57 and @xmath58 luminosities and lower mean energies for all neutrino types .",
    "this is detrimental for explosion in 1.5d ( and perhaps even in 2.5d ) despite centrifugal support @xcite",
    ". a larger fraction of massive stars may form bhs with ( moderate ) rotation than without . left out of this picture are potential magnetohydrodynamics contributions to the explosion mechanism and energetics ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    of particular interest to both formal relativity theory and astrophysics is the range of potential birth spins of bhs .",
    "our results quite strikingly suggest that the rotation rate of the maximum - mass pns and , hence , the spin of the nascent bh , will be limited to values of @xmath424 below @xmath453 by likely nonaxisymmetric dynamics .",
    "if true and confirmed by multi - dimensional simulations , 3d rotational instabilities may be a cosmic censor preventing naked singularities from forming in stellar collapse .",
    "rotation and the associated angular momentum are key ingredients in the collapsar scenario for grbs  @xcite . as part of this study",
    ", we have performed the first bh formation study with the m35oc grb progenitor of @xcite . using the ls220 eos , we predict an initial bh mass of @xmath454 and @xmath424 of @xmath455 . assuming that the grb engine can not operate until a keplerian disk has formed , there will be a delay of @xmath456 between bh formation and grb engine ignition at a bh mass of @xmath457 and @xmath458 .",
    "finally , we re - emphasize that the goal of this study was not to yield accurate predictions about the outcome of core collapse in any individual progenitor .",
