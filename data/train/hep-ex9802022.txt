    "there have been numerous theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies of the fragmentation of heavy quarks . the energy distribution and flavor dependence of heavy quark hadronization",
    "have been modeled by fragmentation functions . the role that spin plays in the hadronization process",
    "is still being investigated and is not well understood at this time@xcite . to increase the understanding of this role , a precise measurement of the probabilities of a meson being directly produced in each of the available spin states is needed .    at cleo",
    ", the fragmentation of charm quarks can be analyzed by making measurements of primary hadrons containing charm quarks from continuum @xmath33 annihilations .",
    "cleo has previously published results of charmed meson energy distributions @xcite as well as the spin alignment of charged @xmath0 mesons@xcite . in this paper an updated measurement of the charged @xmath0 spin alignment using the entire cleo ii dataset",
    "is presented .",
    "according to the quark model , a meson is composed of two spin @xmath34 valence quarks that can combine to form four spin states in the absence of orbital angular momentum , i.e. four @xmath35-wave states . writing these in the basis of total angular momentum , @xmath36 , and its @xmath37-component , @xmath38 ,",
    "they are the vector states @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and the pseudoscalar state @xmath42 , where the @xmath37-direction can be arbitrarily chosen . the probability of an @xmath35-wave meson being produced in a vector state is often described by the ratio @xmath43 defined as @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the respective probabilities of the meson being created in the pseudoscalar and vector states .",
    "the helicity formalism is useful in the context of describing the angular distributions and correlations in the production and decay of particles with non - zero spin . for a particle with momentum @xmath47 ,",
    "the helicity is defined as @xmath48 which in the case of a spin-1 particle is just the @xmath37-component of the spin when the @xmath37-direction has been chosen as the flight direction of the meson .",
    "the helicity density matrix is often used to organize information about the spin of a particle .",
    "the diagonal elements of this matrix @xmath49 , with @xmath50 , represent the probability that the particle has helicity @xmath51 .",
    "simple statistical expectations are that all helicity states of a spin @xmath36 particle are equally populated , but production and fragmentation dynamics can lead to either polarized or aligned particles .",
    "a system of particles is polarized if there is a net angular momentum , i.e. @xmath52 for some helicity @xmath51 , and it is aligned if there is a nonuniform population of states , but @xmath53 for all @xmath51 . since the production and fragmentation processes in this analysis conserve parity and the cesr beams are unpolarized , it is expected that the @xmath0 mesons from @xmath54 are unpolarized , but it is possible for the @xmath0 mesons to be aligned .    to measure the spin alignment of a vector meson , the angular distribution of its decay products is analyzed , but because the angular distributions of the @xmath55 and @xmath56 states are degenerate , the values of @xmath57 and @xmath58 can not be distinguished and only one variable , e.g. @xmath59 , is accessible . from the definition above , the vector meson is aligned if @xmath60 differs from @xmath61 . for the case of a vector meson decaying to two pseudoscalar mesons , the angular distribution can be written @xmath62 \\eqno(3)\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is defined as the angle of a daughter pseudoscalar in the parent vector meson rest frame , with respect to the direction of motion of the parent vector meson in the rest frame of the production process . in our case , the production rest frame of a @xmath0 directly produced in charm fragmentation from @xmath33 annihilation coincides with the lab frame .    by using the variable @xmath64 the angular distribution can be expressed as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a normalization factor equal to @xmath67 .",
    "the value of @xmath68 can range between @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where the angular distribution would be isotropic if @xmath71 , proportional to @xmath72 if @xmath73 and proportional to @xmath74 if @xmath75 .",
    "whereas the naive statistical expectation is that all four @xmath35-wave meson states are created in equal proportions , i.e. @xmath76 ( @xmath71 ) and @xmath77 , there are other models that have been presented where the alignment and @xmath43 vary as a function of momentum@xcite .",
    "heavy quark symmetry predicts that vector mesons containing a single heavy quark are produced unaligned , but there have been suggestions that the value of @xmath43 may depend upon the mass difference of the vector and pseudoscalar mesons@xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that @xmath43 is directly related to the spin alignment @xcite and in the previous cleo @xmath0 spin alignment analysis , a value for @xmath43 was calculated using this relationship @xcite .",
    "however , the validity of the statistical model is assumed when deriving this relationship .",
    "we feel that a determination of @xmath43 for @xmath0 mesons warrants an independent measurement which is the topic of a current cleo analysis .",
    "the results of the @xmath43 analysis will be presented in a future paper .",
    "the cleo ii detector is a general purpose charged and neutral particle detector and is described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the dataset used in this analysis consists of 3.11 fb@xmath3 of data collected at the @xmath78 resonance and 1.61 fb@xmath3 of data collected about 60 mev below the resonance .",
    "this corresponds to approximately 5 million continuum @xmath79 events .",
    "the @xmath80 in this analysis is required to decay through the channel @xmath81 with the @xmath82 decaying either through the mode @xmath83 or @xmath84 ( inclusion of charge conjugate modes is implied throughout this paper ) .",
    "the @xmath85 in the @xmath80 decay is kinematically limited to having a momentum less than 456 mev/@xmath86 in the lab frame of reference , and is referred to as the `` slow '' pion .",
    "all tracks used in this analysis are required to have an impact parameter within 5 mm of the interaction point in the plane transverse to the beam pipe and within 50 mm in the direction of the beam pipe .",
    "tracks are also required to have a momentum less than 6 gev/@xmath86 and an r.m.s .",
    "residual less than 1 mm for their hits .",
    "particle i d is not used since there is little gain for this particular analysis and it introduces the possibility of additional systematic errors . for a pair of photons to be considered as a candidate @xmath87",
    ", they must each have an energy of at least 100 mev , be within the `` good '' barrel of the detector ( @xmath88 ) , have a shower shape in the crystal calorimeters consistent with that of a photon , combine to be within 20 mev/@xmath89 of the neutral pion mass , and have @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the decay angle of the photon in the @xmath87 rest frame , with respect to the @xmath87 direction of motion in the lab frame .    for the @xmath92 mode , the @xmath82",
    "is reconstructed by taking all possible pairs of oppositely charged tracks in an event , assigning the kaon mass to one and the pion mass to the other ( or vice versa ) , adding their four - momenta , and then calculating the invariant mass .",
    "the @xmath80 is reconstructed by adding the four - momentum of a candidate slow @xmath85 in the event to the four - momentum of the candidate @xmath82 .",
    "the mass difference , @xmath93 , between the candidate @xmath82 and @xmath80 is required to be within 2.5 mev/@xmath89 of the world - average mass difference of 145.42 mev/@xmath89 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath82 is spinless and the decay products have an isotropic angular distribution .",
    "however , due to the jet - like nature of continuum events , the background from random track combinations tends to have @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the decay angle of the @xmath96 in the @xmath82 rest frame , relative to the @xmath82 motion in the lab frame .",
    "a requirement that @xmath97 is added to improve the signal - to - background ratio .    for the @xmath98 mode , the four - momentum of a candidate @xmath87 is added to the four - momenta of two oppositely charged tracks to form candidate @xmath82 s in the event .",
    "mass difference and kaon decay angle requirements are the same as described above .",
    "to test models that predict that the alignment varies as a function of the momentum of the @xmath80 , the data are broken up into six @xmath99 bins in the range 0.25 to 1.0 , where @xmath99 is a lorentz - invariant variable defined as @xmath100 where @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 is the world - average value for the mass of a @xmath80 .    for each @xmath99 range , a sideband subtraction is performed .",
    "the sideband region is from 9 mev/@xmath89 to 12 mev/@xmath89 above the mean of the @xmath93 peak and the ratio for the sideband subtraction is determined by fitting the data with a bifurcated double gaussian for the signal plus a background function @xmath104 and integrating the background shape for the signal and sideband regions .",
    "the fits used to determine the sideband ratios are shown in figures [ fig : kpmsdf ] and [ fig : kppmsdf ] .    the sideband - subtracted @xmath105 data is fit for each @xmath99 bin with a double gaussian for the signal region plus a first - order polynomial background .",
    "each of these @xmath99 bins is broken up into five equal @xmath106 bins , where @xmath63 is the angle defined in section ii . to prevent the fitted signal shape from having large fluctuations due to lower statistics in some @xmath106 bins ,",
    "the @xmath82 mass peak is fit for each @xmath106 bin with the ratios of areas and widths of the double gaussian fixed to those found when fitting the mass peak in that momentum range for the entire @xmath106 spectrum .",
    "it is important to understand the relative efficiencies of detecting a @xmath80 in the various @xmath106 bins . in the lowest momentum bins , for example",
    ", the efficiency decreases as @xmath106 approaches one because of the increased difficulty in measuring the track of a slow pion that is emitted in the direction opposite the @xmath0 direction in the lab frame .",
    "detection efficiency as a function of @xmath99 and @xmath106 was measured by analyzing monte carlo data with a geant - based detector simulation .",
    "monte carlo events were generated using the lund jetset 7.3 program , where the @xmath33 annihilation was required to result in a @xmath79 pair with one of the charm quarks hadronizing to a @xmath80 that decays to @xmath107 with @xmath108 , while no constraints were placed on the other charm quark .",
    "the @xmath0 mesons were produced such that their decay to @xmath109 had an isotropic angular distribution in the rest frame of the @xmath80 .",
    "the fits of the sideband subtracted @xmath105 and @xmath110 distributions for all scaled momentum ranges are shown in figures [ fig : kp ] and [ fig : kpp ] .",
    "the efficiency - corrected angular distributions for both decay modes were combined in each @xmath99 bin with a weighted average and are shown in figure [ fig : xbins ] , where they have each been normalized to unit area and fit with eq .",
    "the values of @xmath68 resulting from these fits as well as the fits for each of the two decay modes treated separately are listed in table [ tab : alpha ] .",
    "figure [ fig : alpha ] shows the combined results for @xmath68 plotted as a function of momentum as well as the theoretical curves suggested by suzuki @xcite and cheung and yuan @xcite .",
    "table [ tab : rho ] lists the values of @xmath60 as calculated from the measurement of @xmath68 for each scaled momentum bin . averaging the @xmath106 distributions over all momenta and then fitting gives a value @xmath111 , corresponding to @xmath112 .",
    ".[tab : alpha ] values of @xmath68 for different momentum ranges .",
    "first error given is statistical , second is systematic .",
    "the last column is the confidence level of the fit for the combined values of @xmath68 . [",
    "cols=\">,<,>,<,>,<,>,<,>,<,>,^,<,^ \" , ]",
    "many possible sources of absolute systematic uncertainty , such as the overall track - finding efficiency , do not have a significant effect on this analysis because the extraction of @xmath68 in each momentum range involves only the relative comparisons of the same measured quantity , namely the yield of the @xmath82 decays , in the different bins of @xmath113 .",
    "the remaining sources of uncertainty will therefore be related to extracting the yield and the efficiency as a function of @xmath113 .",
    "the effects of the various sources of systematic error are shown in figure [ fig : syst ] while the methods used to determine these errors are described below .    the monte carlo contribution to the systematic error",
    "was accounted for by including the error in the monte carlo efficiencies in the calculations of the yields . to investigate the systematic error associated with the fitting function",
    ", the analysis was done using a single gaussian rather than a double gaussian to fit the signal peaks .",
    "likewise , to investigate the systematic error associated with the choice of range for the sideband subtraction , the analysis was done using a sideband region from 6 mev/@xmath89 to 9 mev/@xmath89 above the nominal @xmath114 mass difference rather than 9 mev/@xmath89 to 12 mev/@xmath89 above the nominal value .",
    "the effect of the mass difference requirement was investigated by constraining the mass difference to be within 1.25 mev/@xmath89 of the pdg value rather than 2.5 mev/@xmath89 .",
    "the systematic effects of the @xmath106 binning were studied by using six equal @xmath106 bins rather than five .",
    "the differences between the resulting values of @xmath68 and the central value were all summed in quadrature as an estimate of the systematic error and are included in the error bars shown in figure [ fig : alpha ] .",
    "a small linear component in the angular distribution can easily be seen in figure [ fig : xbins ] for the range @xmath115 .",
    "this is most likely due to a slight inaccuracy in the efficiency correction from the monte carlo data .",
    "the data in figure [ fig : xbins ] were fit with a straight line added to eq .",
    "( 4 ) as a check and the difference in the fitted values of @xmath68 was negligible .",
    "we have measured the spin alignment of all @xmath0 mesons produced in @xmath116 interactions at @xmath2 gev .",
    "although the details of the analysis ensure that the measured @xmath0 does not come from a decaying @xmath117 meson , we can not determine any other details about the production hierarchy . from a theoretical standpoint , we are particularly interested in the @xmath0 mesons that are produced directly in the @xmath118 collision , but we can not distinguish these from secondary @xmath0 s resulting from decays of charm mesons with @xmath119 . @xcite .",
    "the most prominent excited charm mesons , which are commonly referred to as @xmath120 mesons , consist of a charm quark and a light anti - quark with relative orbital angular momentum @xmath121 .",
    "they are categorized into four states with spin - parity @xmath122 = @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 . a @xmath123 state decay to @xmath126",
    "is forbidden due to spin - parity conservation while other @xmath0 modes are expected to be suppressed .",
    "when a @xmath125 state decays through a @xmath0 channel , it can only produce a @xmath0 meson with a helicity of @xmath127 in the @xmath125 rest frame , while the @xmath124 states only decay through @xmath0 channels and favor a helicity of 0 in the @xmath124 rest frame . from the measurements available",
    "@xcite , we estimate that 16 - 20% of @xmath0 mesons observed at cleo could be daughters of a @xmath120 meson , not including the contribution from @xmath128 mesons .    although the favored helicities of @xmath0 s from the decays of @xmath125 and @xmath124 charm states partially cancel , it is probable that these @xmath0 s are aligned in their production rest frame , i.e. the rest frame of the parent @xmath120 .",
    "it is expected that any effect would be most noticeable for the highest @xmath99 bins which has the largest correlation between the @xmath0 4-momentum in the lab frame and the @xmath0 4-momentum in the @xmath120 rest frame .",
    "if the 4-momenta in the two reference frames are uncorrelated , as tends to be the case for the lower @xmath99 bins , any alignment of @xmath0 s from @xmath120 s would not be noticeable in the lab frame .    due to the current lack of information about the production and decay of @xmath45-wave charm meson states",
    ", we can only state that @xmath120 decays could have a significant effect on this @xmath0 spin alignment measurement in at least some of the @xmath99 bins .",
    "this analysis is the most precise measurement of the spin alignment of @xmath80 mesons to date .",
    "the data , without any corrections for @xmath120 effects on the measurements , agree well with the statistical model expectation that the @xmath129 state has a @xmath130 probability of being populated .",
