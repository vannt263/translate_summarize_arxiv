    "millisecond pulsars are commonly believed to be descendants of normal neutron stars that have been spun - up and recycled back as radio pulsars by acquiring angular momentum from their companion during the low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) phase @xcite .",
    "there are about @xmath120 high confidence nuclear or accretion powered ( see table  1 ) millisecond x - ray pulsars ( msxps ) which are thought to be the progenitors of millisecond radio pulsars ( msrps ) @xcite .",
    "these msxps may become observable in radio wavelengths once accretion ceases , or the column density of the plasma from the fossil disk around the neutron star becomes thin enough to allow vacuum gap formation that leads to the production of coherent radio emission . towards the end of the secular lmxb evolution , as accretion rates fall below a critical value above",
    "which detection presumably may be hampered due to absorption or dispersion @xcite , the neutron star can re - appear as a msrp .",
    "although the connection between lmxbs and msrps has been significantly strengthened after the discovery of quasi - periodic khz oscillations and x - ray pulsations in some transient x - ray sources @xcite , no radio pulsations from msxps have been detected so far @xcite .    at the end of the recycling process",
    "the neutron star will reach an equilibrium period @xcite which is approximated by the keplerian orbital period at the alfven radius @xcite :    p_eq ~1.9 ms b_9 ^ 6/7 ( ) ^-5/7 ( ) ^-3/7 r^16/7_6 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the neutron star surface magnetic dipole field and radius in units of @xmath4 g and @xmath5 cm respectively .",
    "the eddington limited accretion rate @xmath6 for a neutron star typically is @xmath7 above which the radiation pressure generated by accretion will stop the accretion flow .",
    "this equilibrium period combined with the dominant mechanism for energy loss delineates the subsequent kinematics of the spun - up millisecond pulsar .",
    "the magnetic dipole model then implies a `` spin - up region '' ( @xmath8 ) ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on which the recycled neutron stars will be reborn as msrps . at the end of the active phase , msxps accreting with @xmath9 and spinning with @xmath10 , presumably transition into a msrps with an initial spin period of @xmath11 .    in the standard spin - down model , the msrp evolution",
    "is driven by pure magnetic dipole radiation , i.e. braking index @xmath12 in vacuum ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "alternative energy loss mechanisms such as multipole radiation or gravitational wave emission , especially during the initial phases of the reborn millisecond pulsars , have been suggested by several authors @xcite but have yet to be observationally corroborated .",
    "advanced laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo ) will be able to probe the frequency space at which millisecond pulsars are expected to radiate gravitational waves , thereby putting stringent constraints on the micro physics of millisecond pulsars .    the advances in radio observations , increased sky coverage with deep exposures of current surveys combined with robust post - bayesian statistical techniques that incorporate minimal assumptions , give us unprecedented predictive power on the joint period - spindown ( @xmath0 ) and implied magnetic field ( @xmath13 ) distributions .    in this _",
    ", we attempt to go beyond phenomenological arguments and test whether msxps can produce the characteristics of the observed msrps within the framework of the standard model ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the evolution of millisecond pulsars can be consistently described in terms of * i ) * the equilibrium period distribution ( @xmath14 ) of msxps at the end of the lmxb evolution * ii ) * the mass accretion rates ( @xmath15 ) of the progenitor population during the recycling process * iii ) * galactic birth rates ( @xmath16 ) , and * iv ) * the dominant energy loss mechanism after the onset of radio emission .",
    "we devise a semi - analytical evolution function @xmath17 to parametrize the evolution of millisecond pulsars after the accretion phase , which can be described in closed form as : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the probability distribution function .",
    "the shape parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 define the distributions ( i.e. , @xmath22 for k=1,2,3 ) for the beta functions@xcite inferred from observations at each monte - carlo realization `` r '' .    the evolution function @xmath17 is built by randomly choosing initiation seeds from a period distribution @xmath14 , which is then convolved via the standard model to consequently sample the @xmath0 parameter space . for the observed msxps , the period distribution which seeds will be randomly chosen from is the observed @xmath23 distribution ( table  1 ) .",
    "we uniquely construct a `` relaxed multidimensional kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) filter '' ( fig .",
    "[ fig : probdist ] ) to check population consistencies by calculating the 2d k - s @xcite probabilities ( @xmath24 ) between observed msrps and the synthetic population that is formed by these properly evolved progenitor seeds .",
    "the filtering is reiterated for each realization to obtain synthetic populations with consistent distributions as : @xmath25 which is then used to construct the @xmath19 in equation  [ stat.eq ] .",
    "nominally any @xmath26 value would imply consistent populations in a 2d k - s test . by allowing @xmath27 with lower fractions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : probdist ] ) , we oversample outliers to compensate for possible statistical fluctuations and contaminations .",
    "a peak sampling rate around the nominal acceptance value of @xmath28 is the most optimal scheme that prevents strong biases due to over or under - sampling .",
    "the main goal for oversampling outliers and relaxing the k - s filter is to test whether the standard model can at least marginally produce very fast millisecond pulsars with relatively high magnetic fields like psr b1937 + 21 .",
    "the predictive significance of the @xmath0 distribution for the probability map ( fig  [ fig : msps ] ) is obtained from a monte - carlo run with @xmath29 valid realizations that produce consistent synthetic samples .",
    "whilst sampling the @xmath0 space , no assumptions were made regarding the progenitor period distribution ( @xmath14 ) , the accretion ( @xmath15 ) , or the galactic birth ( @xmath16 ) rates .",
    "the filter ( eq .  [ statd.eq ] , [ statm.eq ] , [ statr.eq ] ) is implicitly driven by the observed msrps .",
    "fig [ fig : msps ] shows the expected @xmath0 distribution for the standard model assuming that msrps have evolved from a progenitor population similar to the observed msxps .",
    "we do not include msrps in globular clusters because the @xmath0 values in these cases may not necessarily be the sole imprint of the binary evolution , but can be significantly changed by possible gravitational interactions due to the crowded field . to explore the extend of the effects of an unevenly sampled progenitor population",
    ", we also show the region in the @xmath0 space that is sensitive to alternative @xmath23 distributions .",
    "the probability map is overlaid with the observed msrps .",
    "the discovery of millisecond pulsations from neutron stars in lmxbs has substantiated the theoretical prediction that links msrps and lmxbs . since then , the recycling process that produces msrps on a spin - up region from lmxbs , followed by spin - down due to dipole radiation has been conceived as the `` standard evolution '' of millisecond pulsars . however , the question whether all observed msrps could be produced within this framework has not been quantitatively addressed until now .",
    "the standard evolutionary process produces millisecond pulsars with periods ( @xmath30 ) and spin - downs ( @xmath31 ) that are not entirely independent .",
    "the possible @xmath0 values that msrps can attain are _ jointly _ constrained by the equilibrium period distribution ( @xmath14 ) of the progenitor population , the mass accretion rates ( @xmath15 ) during the recycling process and the dominant energy loss mechanism after the onset of radio emission .    in order to test whether the observed msrps can be reconciled with a single coherent progenitor population that evolves via magnetic dipole braking after the spin - up process , we have produced the predictive joint @xmath0 distribution of msrps for the standard model .",
    "we did not put restrictions on any of the parameters that drive the evolution .",
    "acceptable @xmath32 and @xmath16 values were implicitly filtered .",
    "we have relaxed the k - s filter ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : probdist ] ) in order to oversample outliers and see whether it is even remotely feasible to produce young millisecond pulsars , like psr b1937 + 21 or j0218 + 4232 , that have higher b fields .",
    "the color contours in figure  [ fig : msps ] represent the @xmath0 densities for msrps that are direct descendants of observed msxps ( i.e. initial spin periods @xmath33 ) .",
    "the standard evolutionary model is able to successfully produce the general demographics of older msrps .",
    "it fails , however , to predict the younger and fastest msrp sub - population that have higher @xmath13 fields .",
    "accretion rates that msrps have experienced during their accretion phase deduced from observed @xmath0 values , combined with the observed msxp period distribution ( @xmath34 ) produces mostly older msrps , including msrps with spin - down ages @xmath35 yrs .",
    "figure  [ fig : msps ] shows clearly that the apparent enigma of millisecond pulsars with spin - down ages older than the age of the galaxy is mainly a manifestation of very low accretion rates during the late stages of the lmxb evolution .    on the other hand ,",
    "no physically motivated @xmath23 distribution has been able to produce the whole msrp population consistently .",
    "the observed period distribution of msxps is likely to be under - sampled due to observational selection effects .",
    "it is also possible that some neutron stars in lmxbs simply do not produce observable pulses . in order to understand how the predicted @xmath0 distribution is affected by different msxp period distributions ,",
    "we have estimated the whole extend of the @xmath0 region that is sensitive to the prior .",
    "the values that may be produced for different @xmath23 distributions are shown by the shaded areas in figure  [ fig : msps ] .",
    "no msxp period distribution could mimic the observed relative ratios of young / old pulsars with high b fields .",
    "the fraction of the observed young / old msrps with high @xmath13 fields is higher than what the standard model predicts by several orders of magnitude .",
    "this may further be exacerbated by strong selection effects that limit our ability to observe very fast millisecond pulsars @xcite .",
    "the choice of a standard k - s test instead of the relaxed 2d k - s only increases the statistical significance .",
    "hence , we argue that young millisecond pulsars with higher magnetic fields ( e.g. psr b1937 + 21 ) are inconsistent with the standard model .    therefore , it is tempting to suggest that the fastest spinning millisecond pulsars , in particular psr b1937 + 21 , may originate from a different evolutionary channel . while it appears that ordinary magnetic - dipole spin down from a source population similar to the observed msxps is adequate to explain the great majority of observed msrps , the low final accretion rates that are required can not be reconciled with the high accretion rates needed to produce the fastest , youngest pulsars .",
    "we believe that it is necessary to posit the existence of a separate class of progenitors , most likely with a different distribution of magnetic fields , accretion rates and equilibrium spin periods , presumably among the lmxbs that have not been revealed as msxps . understanding this additional channel is clearly critical to developing a natural solution to the long lasting `` birth rate problem '' ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is also possible that the standard evolutionary model fails at another point .",
    "for example , if msrps during some portion of their evolution lose energy through a dominant mechanism other than magnetic dipole radiation ( e.g. multipole radiation , gravitational wave or neutrino emission ) , then the evolution of pulsars through the @xmath0 diagram could be complex .",
    "a combination of the above mentioned factors ( i.e. alternative progenitors and subsequent non - standard radiation ) are then likely to play a role in millisecond pulsar evolution .",
    "a msxp period distribution that has sharp multimodal features coupled with non - standard energy loss mechanisms may be able to reconcile for the joint @xmath0 distribution of millisecond pulsars .",
