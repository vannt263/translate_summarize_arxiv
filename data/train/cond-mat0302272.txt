    "the ionic insulator alf@xmath1 has a number of known polymorphs @xcite , which all convert irreversibly to the stable @xmath0-alf@xmath1 within the temperature range approximately 730 to 920 k. recent interest in this material arises due to its catalytic activity for dismutation and halogen exchange reactions @xcite .    above its transition temperature ( about 730 k)@xcite",
    ", @xmath0-alf@xmath1 has the cubic perovskite structure amx@xmath1 , with the a cations absent ( or the reo@xmath1 structure . )",
    "aluminum plays the role of the m cation , and is surrounded by an octahedron of corner - shared fluorine atoms . at low temperature ,",
    "the structure becomes rhombohedral , and this symmetry lowering can be characterized as a rotation of the fluorine octahedron about one of the three - fold axis of the perovskite cubic cell ( or the @xmath4 system in glazer s tilt system @xcite ) . as every adjacent octahedron rotates in the opposite sense ,",
    "the wave - vector of this distortion is ( @xmath5 ) , and the unit cell becomes double the size of that in the cubic phase .",
    "we study the @xmath0-alf@xmath1 structure by using pseudopotentials , a plane - wave basis , and the lda method . after being tested ,",
    "the pseudopotentials are applied in bulk @xmath0-alf@xmath1 .",
    "the total energy surface is examined in the structural parameter space where the cubic phase is compared with the rhombohedral phase found at the deepest nearby minimum of the energy surface .",
    "the troullier and martins method is used to generate the pseudopotentials .",
    "since there are different possibilities of choosing cut - off radii @xmath6 , as well as how many valence orbitals to include in the pseudopotentials , we test the pseudopotentials by doing lda self - consistent iterations for a crystal or molecule prototype and compare the results with fp - lapw @xcite all - electron calculations ( full potential linearized augmented plane - wave @xcite ) .",
    "this provides guidance on the choice of energy cut - off of the plane - wave basis , and also the choice of local potential , in the @xmath0-alf@xmath1 calculation that follows .",
    "the results of these tests are shown in table [ tab : al ] and table [ tab : f ] , for aluminum and fluorine separately .",
    "for the ceperley - alder exchange - correlation energy @xcite , the vosko - wilk - nusair @xcite parametrization is used .",
    "the test of the aluminum pseudopotential is performed in bulk al metal , not only the observed _ fcc _ structure , but also the _ sc _ and _ bcc _ structures , where comparison can still be made between the all - electron method and lda .",
    "the results show that the pseudopotential for the al@xmath7 ion should be capable of describing the unoccupied @xmath8 orbital .",
    "otherwise , even the large @xmath6 ( @xmath9 for @xmath10 and @xmath11 orbitals ) needed to fix the lattice constant in the _ fcc _ aluminum are insufficient to remove the @xmath6-dependence of the lattice constant and bulk modulus . due to the more attractive nature of the @xmath12 pseudopotential , including the @xmath8 orbital reduces the dependence of these two quantities on @xmath6 and the choice of local potential , and improves the agreement with the all - electron results .",
    "better agreement is also seen in comparisons for @xmath13 and _ bcc _ structures of al metal .",
    "the fluorine pseudopotential is tested for the f@xmath14 molecule . unlike the low plane - wave cut - off needed for aluminum ( less than 40 rydberg ) , more than 90 rydberg is needed in the f@xmath14 molecule . for bulk al metal",
    "we use a k - point mesh of 12@xmath1512@xmath1512 that contains 56 special k - points , while for f@xmath14 we do a one k - point calculation .",
    "results in the following sections are calculated using pseudopotentials ( al@xmath16 , f@xmath16 ) as shown in the captions of the tables .",
    "this set of pseudopotentials gives the lattice constant ( @xmath17 ) , and bulk modulus ( @xmath18 gpa ) of cubic @xmath0-alf@xmath1 in good agreement with all - electron results ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 gpa . )    .aluminum pseudopotential tests on bulk al .",
    "the first column shows the cut - off radii in units of bohr radius ( @xmath21 ) for the valence orbitals ( l=0,1,2 ) .",
    "tests with r@xmath22 omitted do not include the @xmath12 orbital .",

    "@xmath25e is defined to be zero for the _ fcc _ structure , while the total energy differences between _ fcc _ and other structures can be compared with all - electron results .",

    "[ tab : al ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      previous workers @xcite investigated the phonon spectrum of the cubic phase using the generalized gordon - kim method@xcite .",
    "density functional theory was applied to construct the charge distribution and polarizability of ion .",
    "an approximate crystal energy is then calculated from the ion results , and is used to examine the crystal lattice dynamics .",
    "however they did not find an instability of the cubic phase , which is contradictory to the experiment .",

    "viewed from the cubic phase , the octahedron rotation that governs the structural transition is the r@xmath30 mode ( in kovalev labelling ) at the zone boundary ( @xmath5)@xcite . after distortion , the r@xmath30 mode gives rise to the zone - center a@xmath31 mode and one of the three e@xmath32 modes .",

    "the formation of a dipole plays an important role in the energy difference between the two @xmath0-alf@xmath1 structures .",
    "when the inner parameter @xmath33 is non - zero , each fluorine atom develops a dipole ( aluminum atoms sit on inversion centers and therefore can not have dipoles ) .",
    "starting from the cubic structure , the distortion from @xmath33 alone defines the octahedron rotation angle @xmath51 about the [ 111 ] axis ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : delta ] ) and already lowers the symmetry to @xmath27 .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 is irrelevant to the @xmath52 ratio , but it does flatten the octahedron ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : zeta ] ) .",
    "it also elongates the al - f bond length , and introduces a polarization to each fluorine .",
    "the energy gain from the fluorine dipole - dipole interaction drives the structure off - cubic .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig : delta ] , where the cubic structure is found to be not a metastable solution .",
    "a naive picture of ionic solids has spherical electron charge clouds of total charge q@xmath53 around the @xmath54 ion . in reality ,",
    "charge clouds are distorted .",
    "for example , in high t cubic @xmath0-alf@xmath1 , the f ions are noticeably prolate when examined in a ( 100)-plane charge contour calculation @xcite .",
    "this distortion is still evident in the low t rhombohedral phase , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cdp ] . the value of the charge q@xmath53 , on the other hand , is not uniquely definable . by creating a sphere centered at each fluorine atom , with a radius that only allows neighboring spheres in the rhombohedral phase to touch each other at one point",
    ", we define a volume to examine the charge and the dipole moment of the fluorine . in the cubic phase ,",
    "such a sphere contains charge -0.675@xmath55 , while it contains -0.68@xmath55 in the rhombohedral phase ( with a slightly different radius . ) using the same sphere , we compute the local induced dipole moment @xmath56 of the fluorine ion ( which also has no unique definition @xcite . ) as expected from symmetry , @xmath57 in the cubic phase , whereas @xmath58 in the rhombohedral phase , pointing from the fluorine position of the unbent al - f - al bond towards the actual distorted fluorine position .",
    "note that the displacive dipole is @xmath59 , defined by the fluorine charge -0.675@xmath55 and the displacement @xmath60 of the fluorine ion when the al - f - al bonds bend . by symmetry ,",
    "the other fluorine sitting at the opposite side of the octahedron has its dipole pointing exactly in the opposite direction .",
    "therefore the material could be called antiferroelectric @xcite .",
    "[ 0.42 ] direction is ill - defined since it is inherited from the cubic phase , but the plane shown here does contain the aluminum ions ( labelled in solid dots ) that form the ( 100 ) plane in the cubic phase .",
    "the fluorine ions are slightly off the plane shown here , and display clearly a prolate charge distribution .",
    "[ fig : cdp],title=\"fig : \" ]    the dipoles and charges can as well be determined by doing integration in one of the equivalent polyhedra that surround the f@xmath61 ions and partition the whole space ( the al@xmath7 s sit on shared vertices of the f@xmath61 polyhedra . ) in this way , the ions are charged as al@xmath7 and f@xmath61 , while @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "it is worthwhile to see if a simplified picture with these numbers helps to understand the energy . in lda ,",
    "the energy includes the exact electrostatic or hartree energy from the electron charge clouds , as well as other quantum effects ( energy of delocalization , exchange and correlation . ) purely classical electrostatic models ( plus hard core repulsion ) , on the other hand , provide a simple but useful view .",
    "we shall see how much classical electrostatic energy comes from the charge and if this helps to explain the stability of the structural deformation .    in a simplified picture",
    "where only electrostatic energy and dipole formation energy ( @xmath64 in eq .",
    "[ eq : madel ] , where @xmath65 @xcite ) are considered , the total energy is @xmath66 this form leaves out the quantum effects and the effect from covalent bond angle .",
    "we find that @xmath67 , which is purely ionic electrostatic ( including displacive dipoles ) , is less negative in the rhombohedral structure than in the cubic structure ( i.e. , if the same ion charge assignment is considered in both cases . ) however , when the induced - dipole - related terms ( @xmath68 ) are also considered , the energy is lowered . by assuming point charges and point dipoles , we use the results from the polyhedron method to illustrate this picture :",
    "@xmath67 per two alf@xmath1 formulas in the rhombohedral phase is 1 ev higher than that in the cubic phase ; but @xmath69 and @xmath70 bring the energy @xmath71 down , with the cost of @xmath64 , to 0.97 ev lower than the cubic phase ( which has only @xmath67 . )",
    "this suggests that the effect of induced dipoles is more than enough to compensate the energy loss from the structural distortion .",
    "we report an lda study of bulk @xmath0-alf@xmath1 . by examining the @xmath2=0 energy surface for structures of the phases on both sides of the transition , we find the structural parameters to agree with previous experiments , and the cubic phase not to be a metastable solution . using the result of lda , the density of states plot and the dielectric function are provided . at the @xmath3-point , the predicted a@xmath31 soft phonon mode and e@xmath32 modes are compared with previous raman experiment , while two other a@xmath36 modes are predicted .",
    "we look at the charge and dipole moment at each fluorine ion , and use these quantities to calculate the classical electrostatic energy . in the antiferroelectric distortion which accompanies the structural transition , a classical calculation shows that the electrostatic energy gain from dipoles is more than enough to compensates the energy loss from the ion - array deformation .",
