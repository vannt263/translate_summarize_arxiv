    "low excitation forbidden lines of [ o  i ] and [ s  ii ] are some of the defining spectroscopic characteristics of the low - mass , pre - main sequence stars known as t tauri stars ( tts , * ? ? ?",
    "their broad , blueshifted emission profiles were originally interpreted as arising in winds with receding flows occulted by the circumstellar disk @xcite , and the correlation between their luminosity and the luminosity of infrared emission from the disk demonstrated that the forbidden line emission was powered by accretion @xcite . studies of large samples of tts conducted by @xcite , @xcite ( hereafter heg ) , and @xcite showed that forbidden lines in these stars are characterized by two distinct components : a high velocity component ( hvc ) and a low velocity component ( lvc ) .    the hvc forbidden emission , typically blueshifted by 30 to 150 km / s , was demonstrated to be formed in microjets , small - scale analogs to the parsec - long collimated jets emerging from more embedded class i young stellar objects ( ysos ) @xcite .",
    "a correlation between mass loss rates , derived from the luminosity of the hvc in the strongest [ o  i ] 6300  forbidden line and the accretion luminosity and/or disk accretion rate has been the foundation of the accretion - outflow connection in young accreting stars ( heg , @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of the outflows traced by the hvc is not yet fully understood , but is likely tied to mass and angular momentum loss in the accretion disk and/or the accreting star through magnetized magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) winds @xcite .",
    "the origin of the lvc forbidden emission is even less well understood .",
    "heg found the lvc to be present in all tts with near infrared ( nir ) excess at k - l ( class ii sources , e.g. @xcite ) , typically with small blueshifts @xmath1 5 km / s .",
    "they considered the possibility the lvc might arise in a slow wind on the surface of a disk in keplerian rotation with the lvc surface brightness decreasing as @xmath2 .",
    "this possibility was investigated more thoroughly by @xcite who used line luminosities and line ratios to evaluate the physical conditions in the wind , and estimated disk wind mass loss rates as @xmath3/yr .",
    "the possibility that the lvc emission might trace thermally driven disk winds powered by photoevaporative heating due to extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) radiation from the central accreting star was investigated by @xcite .",
    "however , the euv heated flows produced very little neutral oxygen and thus could not account for the lvc observations .",
    "more recently , the growing realization that photoevaporative flows are likely an important means of disk dispersal during the era of planet formation has led to renewed interest in additional sources of heating for photoevaporation , i.e. x - ray and far ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation .",
    "these have the potential of producing significant amounts of neutral oxygen in the flow and accounting for the lvc forbidden emission @xcite .",
    "another new development is the acquisition of high resolution spectra of [ ne  ii ] at 12.8 . to date , 24 high - resolution profiles of [ ne  ii ] in tts have been acquired , showing , like the optical [ o  i ] profiles , a mixture of high velocity and low velocity components . low velocity components of [ ne  ii ] , blueshifted from -2 to -12 km / s , are seen in 13/24 of the high resolution spectra , and have been interpreted as direct tracers of photoevaporative flows ( see the recent review by @xcite and references therein ) . although the ionization required to produce substantial [ ne  ii ] emission in a photoevaporative flow could arise either from euv or x - ray heating , @xcite compared the measured [ ne  ii ] luminosities with upper limits on the euv radiation reaching the disk and demonstrated that , at least in three systems , this emission probes the x - ray rather than euv - ionized surface . due to the fact that x - rays penetrate deep in the disk and drive flows that are mostly neutral , blueshifted [ ne  ii ] emission signals mass loss rates that are considerably higher than if the heating is from euv , possibly as high as @xmath4m@xmath5/yr . such mass loss rates are comparable to those estimated by @xcite from the lvc optical lines .",
    "if these mass loss rates are characteristic of photoevaporative flows , their similarity to tts disk accretion rates ( e.g. @xcite ) , suggest that photoevaporation may play a major role early in the evolution and dispersal of protoplanetary material .",
    "photoevaporation can drastically change the disk surface density by opening gaps in planet - forming regions that widen with time , thus setting the timescale over which [ giant ] planet formation must occur .",
    "the implication this would have on the final architecture of planetary systems , the chemistry of the disk , planet interactions ( such as the delivery of volatiles to planets located in the inner solar system ) , and the final mass and location of giant planets specifically , would be critical to enhancing our understanding of planet formation more generally .    a better understanding of the empirical properties of the forbidden lvc in tts is needed to assess whether it arises in photoevaporative flows .",
    "two recent works , @xcite , ( hereafter r13 ) and @xcite , ( hereafter n14 ) have begun this process and provide the motivation for the present study .",
    "r13 introduced two changes in interpreting the lvc .",
    "firstly , r13 revisited the forbidden line data from heg with modern estimates for the accretion luminosity .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the mass accretion rates in heg were too large by nearly an order of magnitude due to uncertain bolometric corrections to the continuum excess measured in the r band , and from the simplistic assumption that the accretion luminosity was produced in a boundary layer at the stellar surface .",
    "r13 re - derived the accretion luminosity for 30 of the heg stars from h@xmath6 emission lines , observed simultaneously with the forbidden lines , which appeared in @xcite .",
    "they found correlations between the lvc luminosity from heg with the improved accretion luminosities as well as with published values for fuv and stellar luminosities , but not with literature values for the x - ray luminosity .",
    "this led to the suggestion that _ if _ the lvc is from a photoevaporative flow , fuv heating may be more important than x - ray radiation in generating [ o  i ] emission , although if [ ne  ii ] emission were also present then x - rays would need to be a contributor as well .",
    "a further implication would be that photoevaporative flows might be prevalent throughout the t tauri phase , decreasing in proportion to the disk accretion rate .    secondly , r13 demonstrated , with a small set of new high resolution spectra , that the lvc itself may have two kinematic components .",
    "focusing on only two [ o  i ] lvc that were well separated from any hvc emission , the profiles were decomposed into a broad and a narrow contribution , with the suggestion that the broad feature may be formed in bound material in the disk and rotationally broadened , while the narrow feature may be associated with material from further out in the disk , possibly in a photoevaporative flow .",
    "the study of n14 provided further refinement of the definition of the lvc for 44 tts in lupus and @xmath7 ori . in heg",
    "the lvc was defined very simply , assigning any emission within 60 km / s of line center to the lvc and outside of that to the hvc , using profiles from echelle spectra with a velocity resolution of 12 km / s .",
    "n14 improved on this by applying gaussian fitting techniques to separate hvc from lvc emission , although their low spectral resolution of 35 km / s meant that a clear separation between these two components was not always possible , nor could they resolve the lvc into a broad and narrow component as done in r13 .",
    "nevertheless , they found good correlations between the total lvc luminosity and both the stellar luminosity and the accretion luminosity , but not the x - ray luminosity .",
    "they interpret the lvc as arising in a slow wind ( @xmath8 km / s ) that is dense ( n@xmath9@xmath10 ) , warm ( t @xmath11k ) , and mostly neutral .    in this paper",
    ", we continue the investigation of the empirical properties of the lvc forbidden lines in tts in order to elucidate their origin .",
    "while the possibility that they may provide a direct tracer of photoevaporative flows that are responsible for protoplanetary disk clearing is intriguing , other potential contributors are the base of mhd centrifugal winds and heated , bound gas in the disk itself .",
    "our study differs from previous ones in two major ways .",
    "first , our sample of tts spans a larger range of evolutionary stages when compared to the sample of heg ( sects .",
    "[ sect : sample ] and [ sect : accr ] ) . secondly , using keck / hires we reach a spectral resolution that is more than five times higher than n14 and about two times higher than heg ( see section  [ sect : obs ] ) .",
    "this high spectral resolution enables us to define the kinematic structure of the lvc , where about half the detected sources show two kinematic components and the remaining lvc are separated into either broad or narrow profiles ( sects .",
    "[ sect : profiles ] and [ sect : res_lvc ] ) .",
    "we discuss the relation of these components to mhd and photoevaporative winds in section  [ sect : discussion ] .",
    "for this project , we focus on the kinematic properties of several forbidden lines in t tauri stars : [ o  i ] 6300.304  , [ o  i ] 5577.339  , and [ s  ii ] 6730.810 ",
    ". we also searched for [ o  ii ] 7329.670  but did not detect it in any source .",
    "in addition , we use h@xmath6 as a tracer of the accretion luminosity and disk accretion rate @xcite . in the following subsections",
    "we describe our sample ( [ sect : sample ] ) , the observations ( [ sect : obs ] ) , the methodology to create forbidden line profiles free from telluric and photospheric absorption ( [ sect : line_profiles ] ) , and the evaluation of line equivalent widths and upper limits ( [ sect : ews ] ) .",
    "all of our science targets , with the exception of tw hya , belong to the well - characterized star - forming region of taurus - auriga ( age @xmath11 myr and average distance 140 pc ; @xcite ) .",
    "our sample represents the spread of disk properties and disk accretion rates , but not the statistical distribution of mass , age , or other properties in this star formation region .",
    "the required high s / n precluded observing late m dwarfs and brown dwarfs , and disk inclination was not one of the criteria used to select our targets .",
    "our sample is presented in table [ tab : source_properties ] and consists of 33 mostly single and bright ( b@xmath1216 ) t tauri stars ( tts ) with disk spectral energy distributions encompassing : 26 class ii , full disks with optically thick inner regions ; 5 transition disks , with absent or low nir to mid - infrared ( mir ) excess emission from the inner disk but large far - infrared ( fir ) emission ; and , 2 class ii / iii evolved disks with weak nir to fir excess . additional information on this sample can be found in @xcite , who analyzed the na d and k profiles ( at 5889.95 and 7698.96  , respectively ) from the same spectra presented here .",
    "the spectral types ( spty ) , extinctions ( @xmath13 ) , stellar bolometric luminosities ( @xmath14 ) , and stellar masses ( @xmath15 ) in table [ tab : source_properties ] are all taken from @xcite who derived them in a homogeneous way from spectrophotometric data , while taking into account excess continuum emission ( veiling ) and extinction when deriving the stellar properties .",
    "is taken from @xcite . ]",
    "table [ tab : source_properties ] also gives disk inclinations for 22 stars taken from the literature based on spatially resolved disk images , shown by @xcite to be the most reliable means of determining system orientations .",
    "for most sources uncertainties are reported to be @xmath1 10% . however , for one source , dr tau , nominally reliable techniques for estimating inclination range from close to face - on to almost edge - on and suggest that the inner and outer disk ( @xmath1610au ) have different orientations @xcite . resolved millimeter continuum images point to a highly inclined outer disk ( @xmath1@xmath17 , @xcite and @xmath1@xmath18 , @xcite ) .",
    "however , mir interferometric visibilities coupled with spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting , as well as modeling of the spectroastrometic signal in the co ro - vibrational line , suggest a much smaller inclination for the inner disk ( @xmath19 , @xcite and @xmath20 , @xcite ) . additional evidence for a small inclination to the inner disk comes from exceptionally deep and broad sub - continuum blueshifted absorption at both he i 10830  and h@xmath6 @xcite , requiring absorption along a line of sight through a wind that emerges radially from the stellar poles . from these considerations ,",
    "we adopt a disk inclination of @xmath21 for dr tau , since , as will be shown in section [ sect : inclination ] , the lvc forbidden line emission is likely to arise within just @xmath15au of the star . for an additional 10 targets with no reliable inclination reported in the literature , we calculate potential disk inclinations based on forbidden line widths , as described in section [",
    "sect : inclination ] and noted in table [ tab : source_properties ] with a dagger .",
    "we observed all targets using the keck / hires spectrograph @xcite with the c5 decker and a 1.1x 7slit , which covers a wavelength range of 4,800 - 9,000    at a nominal resolution of 37,500 .",
    "@xcite independently calculated the spectral resolution achieved by hires in this setting and found a slightly better resolution of @xmath145,000 corresponding to 6.6 km / s .",
    "the targets were observed in two campaigns with the same instrumental setting , one in 2006 and another in 2012 .",
    "two of the targets , ux tau a and ip tau , were observed in both campaigns .",
    "in addition to the science targets , we observed 5 late type stars that are used as photospheric standards and a set of o / b type stars which are used as telluric standards .",
    "spectra were acquired in the standard mode which places the slit along the parallactic angle to minimize slit losses .",
    "slit position angles with respect to disk position angles are discussed in appendix  [ pa_appendix ] and the table therein .",
    "the data reduction was carried out using the highly automated mauna kea echelle extraction ( makee ) pipeline written by tom barlow .",
    "in addition to bias - subtraction , flat - fielding , spectral extraction and wavelength calibration , the pipeline automatically subtracts the sky .",
    "an example of a spectrum before and after sky subtraction is discussed in appendix  [ pa_appendix ] and the figure therein .",
    "further details about the data reduction and source exposure times are given in @xcite .      in order to identify weak intrinsic emission in the forbidden lines",
    "we first remove any telluric and/or photospheric absorption contaminating the spectral order of interest .",
    "telluric absorption is prevalent in the orders containing [ o  i ] 6300  and [ o  ii ] 7330  , but minimal for [ o  i ] 5577  and [ s  ii ] 6731   .",
    "we remove the atmospheric features by matching the telluric lines in an o / b standard star to those in the target spectrum and then dividing the target spectrum by the telluric standard . in order to remove photospheric lines ,",
    "we follow a procedure motivated by the approach of @xcite .",
    "first , we select a photospheric standard with a spectral type that closely matches the spectral type of the target star . if need be , we broaden the absorption lines of the photospheric standard to match the width of the lines present in the target spectrum .",
    "we then apply a cross - correlation technique to shift the photospheric standard to align with the photospheric lines in the target spectrum , and if necessary , we add a flat continuum to the photospheric standard to match veiled photospheric lines in the young accreting stars .",
    "the veiling ( @xmath22 ) is defined as the ratio of the excess to the photospheric flux , and @xmath23 is included in table [ tab : oi_5577_6300 ] , with values ranging from 5.6 ( dr tau ) to 0 ( 5 sources ) .",
    "the final corrected profile is created by dividing the target spectrum by the veiled photospheric spectrum of the standard .",
    "this method for correcting the line profiles is illustrated in figure  [ fig : resid_example ] for the [ o  i ] emission features at 6300 and 5577  for two sources .",

    "the five photospheric standards and their spectral types are : hr  8832 ( k3 ) , hbc  427 ( k6 ) , v819  tau ( k8 ) , gl  15a ( m2 ) , v1321  tau ( m2 ) .",

    "in accreting tts , most of the uv and optical excess continuum emission derives from energy released through accretion , attributed to magnetospheric accretion shocks on the stellar surface @xcite .",
    "ideally accretion luminosities are determined from flux calibrated spectra that include the balmer discontinuity , where the spectrum of the continuum uv - excess can be modeled with accretion shocks @xcite . since our echelle spectra",
    "are not flux - calibrated , accretion luminosities can be estimated using well calibrated relationships relating line and accretion luminosities first demonstrated by @xcite and recently summarized in @xcite .",
    "this approach is superior to the older technique of using the emission excess ( veiling ) at one wavelength in the paschen continuum , which requires applying an uncertain bolometric correction .",
    "here we will use the calibration on the h@xmath6 line luminosity from @xcite because it is based on a large sample of low - mass stars and simultaneous uv - excess measurements of the accretion luminosity .    with our echelle spectra , emission line equivalent widths ( @xmath31 )",
    "can be converted into a line luminosity using the following relation : @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the distance to the science target , @xmath34 is the photospheric continuum flux density near the line of interest , and the factor ( 1 + @xmath22 ) converts the observed equivalent width to one that is veiling corrected , i.e. measured in units of the stellar continuum . for this work , we chose h@xmath6 for an accretion diagnostic since it is detected in all of our targets .",
    "we adopt distances from @xcite , and use their published extinction corrected continuum flux density at 7510  , in conjunction with the ratio of the flux densities at 6600  and 7510  in the pickles atlas for stars matched in spectral type to each science target @xcite to determine the stellar flux density near h@xmath6 .",
    "the veiling @xmath22 at 6300  listed in table [ tab : oi_5577_6300 ] is very close to that at h@xmath6 and was adopted here . while this approach assumes the stellar continuum has not varied , it does account for any variability in veiling between our observations and that of @xcite in setting the continuum flux adjacent to the line .",

    "the definition of the latter two will be described in the next section .",
    "we estimate a typical uncertainty for @xmath44 as follows .",
    "sixteen of our targets have multi - epoch r - band photometry measurements @xcite where the standard deviation of the photometric points over the mean r - magnitude is at most 0.1 , which indicates that variability in the continuum is probably not a major source of uncertainty for most stars .",
    "the extinctions derived by @xcite also have a small uncertainty , only 0.15 dex .",
    "therefore , the major uncertainty in @xmath44 will be the calibration of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "errors in the slope and y intercept of this relation are included in equation  2 . adding these uncertainties in quadrature gives a final uncertainty on @xmath44 of @xmath1 0.3 dex .",
    "variations in tts h@xmath6 ew and veiling , attributed to variations in accretion luminosity , are typically less than a factor of two .",
    "two of our targets , ux tau a and ip tau , were observed in both 2006 and 2012 with changes in h@xmath6 ew by factors 1.2 and 1.5 , respectively , with negligible changes in veiling .",
    "this level of variability corresponds to a variation of @xmath1 0.2 dex in @xmath44 .",
    "the range in h@xmath6 ew for our sample runs from a low of 1.2  to a high of 230  , translating into a span of more than three orders of magnitude in @xmath44 and @xmath45 , with accretion luminosities from @xmath46 to @xmath47 @xmath48 , and mass accretion rates from @xmath49 to @xmath50 @xmath51/year .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that for @xmath44 @xmath52 there is a possibility for chromospheric emission to dominate the line luminosity .",
    "since the continuum veiling is a diagnostic of accretion , deriving from excess emission in the accretion shock on the stellar surface , the relation between @xmath23 and @xmath44 , shown graphically in figure  [ fig : lacc_veiling ] , offers additional insight on whether a star is accreting . in general these quantities",
    "are correlated , in the sense that there is a well defined lower boundary in @xmath44 at a given veiling with considerable scatter above that boundary = 5.6 and 3.5 respectively , do not fall into the relation between veiling and l@xmath36 defined by the other stars .",
    "exceptionally high veilings for these sources were also found by heg . either the relation between veiling and accretion luminosity breaks down at high veilings @xcite and/or the accretion luminosities based on h@xmath6 are severely underestimated due to strong wind absorption features in sources with high disk accretion rates and high veilings . ] .",
    "for example , the objects with low veiling ( @xmath23 of 0 or 0.1 ) have inferred accretion luminosities spanning two orders of magnitude . we conclude from this that it is not possible to assign an unambiguous accreting / non - accreting status based on the level of the h@xmath6 ew or absence of veiling , sometimes used as thresholds for defining classical ( accreting ) or weak ( non - accreting ) tts .",
    "since all of our targets have disks in various evolutionary states , we will treat them all identically in converting h@xmath6 into accretion luminosities .",

    "this comparison of veiling corrected ew shows comparable emission strength of the lvc for most sources , with the exception of dn tau , which , as seen in figure  [ fig : heg_profile_scaled ] , has disappeared since 1995 . in the other sources ,",
    "the differences in the veiling corrected equivalent width between the two epochs could be attributed to differences in the definition of the lvc , variation in the stellar continuum and/or variability in the line luminosity itself , or possibly to extended emission in some lvc observed with different stellar psf or slit orientations , as hinted at in @xcite .",
    "the complete disappearance of [ o  i ] 6300  emission in dn tau is surprising , making it the only source known to date that is accreting but has no [ o  i ] 6300  emission .",
    "the [ o  i ] 6300  equivalent width found by heg is 0.43  while our upper limit @xmath1 0.007  , about two orders of magnitude lower than in 1995 .",

    "we checked for variability in the continuum with the @xcite catalogue .",
    "it was rather stable at r mag @xmath1 11.5 between 1980 and 1986 , and brightened by @xmath1 0.5 mag through 1995 , the last year of recorded data .",
    "the profile for dn tau seen in heg qualifies as solely lvc , which combined with our current two epochs for ip tau ( see figure  [ fig : iptau ] ) , gives two examples where the lvc has vanished , although in most stars it appears stable over timescales of decades .",
    "additional observations of both dn tau and ip tau would be of interest to see if their lvc returns .",
    "another interesting comparison is the implication for the velocity of the lvc , noted to be typically blueshifted by @xmath1 5 km / s by heg . although the kinematic structure in the lvc is unchanged in the two studies ( figure  [ fig : heg_profile_scaled ] ) , in the present study of lvc emission we find that only 12/25 of the bc and 9/18 of the nc are blueshifted relative to the stellar photosphere ( table [ tab:2_gaus_params ] ) .",

    "the kendall @xmath61 probability that the two quantities are uncorrelated is indeed only 0.9% if we exclude dk  tau , but it increases to 7.5% when dk tau is included .",
    "6300 lvc in the 13 sources where both are present.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we next explore the relationship between the width of the [ o  i ] 6300  lvc nc and bc with the published values for disk inclination in 22 sources .",
    "to directly compare our results with those already published for the co ro - vibrational line , we follow @xcite and plot the fwhm divided by the square root of the stellar mass versus the inclination from spatially resolved disks , rather than the fwhm vs the sine of disk inclination , which would be a better description of the relation expected for keplerian broadening ( left panel of figure  [ fig : inclination_plot ] ) .",
    "the figure shows that the two quantities are positively correlated , both for the bc and the nc components .",
    "there are two outliers in the bc relation , dk tau and fm tau . dk tau is the source that did not show the expected behavior between nc and bc fwhm in figure [ fig : fwhm ] and here we see that the nc is in line with other sources at similar inclinations .",
    "the very low mass source fm tau ( 0.1 m@xmath70 ) lies off the scale of the plot , but as we will show in section  [ sect : radialbrightness ] , this can be explained if the emitting region is closer in than for stars of higher mass .",
    "again , following @xcite we will use the positive linear correlation to infer disk inclinations for the remaining sources . in order to include uncertainties in this process",
    "we assume an uncertainty of @xmath1 10% in the disk inclination , as reported in the references in table  [ tab : source_properties ] .",
    "for the fwhm , we adopt a monte carlo approach similar to that discussed in section [ sect : ews ] in relation to the uncertainties on the measured ews . using the 17 single component lvc sources",
    ", we find an average uncertainty that is @xmath1 13% of the measured fwhms . as for the uncertainties on stellar masses , we assume 10@xmath71 for stars with masses",
    "@xmath67 1 m@xmath70 and 30@xmath71 for stars with masses @xmath72 1 m@xmath70 ( see @xcite ) . finally ,",
    "in order to calculate the total uncertainty on the y - axis , we propagate the error on the stellar mass and fwhm , assuming they are independent .    adopting these uncertainties and using a linear relationship between fwhm / @xmath73 and disk inclination , we find the following best fits from the 22 sources with measured inclinations :    @xmath74    @xmath75    where fwhm is measured in km / s , m@xmath76 is measured in m@xmath70 and inclination is measured in degrees . these fits",
    "demonstrate that although the nc and bc both correlate with disk inclination , they have different slopes , suggesting that they trace different regions .",
    "assuming that the broadening is due solely to keplerian rotation , we compute the [ o  i ] disk radii from the velocity at the hwhm . the black solid lines in figure  [ fig : inclination_plot ] show that the nc probes disk radii between 0.5 and 5 au while the bc traces gas much closer in , between 0.05 and 0.5 au .",
    "we can compare these results to those of @xcite for co , where our linear fits are shown as red lines in figure  [ fig : inclination_plot ] and those for co are shown in green .",
    "we find similar slopes for the bc of both co and [ o  i ] but slightly more extended disk radii for the [ o  i ] than for the co ( the bc co disk radii range from 0.04 to 0.3au ) .",
    "the slopes for the nc of co and [ o  i ] are not in agreement , and the inferred formation region for [ o  i ] , from 0.5 to 5au , is again slightly further from the star than that inferred for the nc of co ( 0.2 - 3au ) .",
    "we can then use the linear fits presented above to derive disk inclinations for the sources with no disk - based inclination values in the literature ( right panel of figure  [ fig : inclination_plot ] ) . for the sources where the lvc has only one component",
    ", we calculate the inclination using equations 5 or 6 depending on whether it is classified as nc or bc . for the sources where the lvc has both a broad and a narrow component , we calculate the inclination of each component individually (",
    "both are shown in figure  [ fig : inclination_plot ] ) and take a weighted mean to derive the source inclination .",
    "inclinations derived from these fits to the bc and nc relations are reported in table [ tab : source_properties ] and are marked with a dagger .      in the previous section",
    ", we found that the nc of the lvc has a line width consistent with keplerian broadening at a distance between 0.5 and 5au from the star . here",
    "we will explore the range of radii in the disk required to account for the observed nc profile assuming a simple power law surface brightness fall off .",
    "of the 18 sources with nc in their lvc , 9 have velocity centroids consistent with bound gas meaning that their profiles can be modeled with a simple keplerian disk . of these 9 sources 4 are transition disks ( tds ) , so we can also test whether the distribution of the gas in disks with dust cavities extending from a few to tens of au @xcite , is different from the nc of class  ii sources .",
    "our modeling uses a power law distribution for the line surface brightness of the form @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the radial distance from the star and @xmath6 is varied between 0 and 2.5 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the radial profile is converted into a velocity profile assuming keplerian rotation , with the stellar mass and disk inclination in table [ tab : source_properties ] as additional input parameters .",
    "the model line is convolved with a velocity width @xmath79 where @xmath80 is",
    "the instrumental broadening ( 6.6km / s ) and @xmath81 is the thermal broadening .",
    "we assume a temperature of 5,000k to compute @xmath81 because the [ o  i ] emission might trace hot collisionally excited gas ( @xcite ) .",
    "we then use the _ mpfitfun _ idl routinecraigm / idl / idl.html ] to find the best fit to the observed line profiles where an uncertainty equal to the rms on the continuum is adopted for each flux measurement .",
    "the parameters that are varied in the fitting procedure are the inner and outer radii of the emitting gas and @xmath6 .",
    "our best fits to the nc [ o  i ] 6300  profiles of three representative sources with very similar inclinations ( @xmath82 ) but different disk types and mass accretion rates are shown in figure  [ fig : td_models ] .",
    "our simple model does a good job in reproducing the observed nc profiles and shows that the radial extent of the gas emitting the nc lvc is from within 1au , to explain the relatively large fwhms , out to @xmath110au , to explain the lack of double peaks in the profiles ( see table  [ tab : model_results ] for a summary of inferred parameters ) .",
    "we see a trend between the inner and outer radii and the stellar mass , with the smallest [ o  i ] emitting region located around the lowest mass star dm tau and the largest around the most massive @xmath83 stars in our sample dr  tau and ux  tau a. the power law index of the surface brightness ranges from flat @xmath6= 0 ( for df  tau ) to @xmath6= 2.2 ( for ux  tau a and tw  hya ) . using the best fit surface brightness we also compute the radius within which 80% of the nc lvc emission arises ( r@xmath84 in figure  [ fig : td_models ] and table  [ tab : model_results ] ) and find it to be within @xmath85au , in agreement with the [ o  i ] disk radii estimated from the nc hwhm ( see figure  [ fig : inclination_plot ] ) .",
    "our steepest power law indexes of @xmath12.2 are very similar to those inferred for cw  tau and dq  tau by heg after re - centering their blueshifted [ o  i ] profiles in the stellocentric frame and assuming that the entire line broadening is due to keplerian rotation .",
    "the extent of the [ o  i ] emitting region for these two sources is inferred to be between 0.1 out 20au , similar to the ranges we find .",
    "this hints that keplerian broadening may also dominate the profile of wind sources .",
    "we plan to model wind profiles in a future paper by adding an unbound component with a prescribed velocity field to the bound keplerian disk .",
    "6300  profiles in 3 sources with the same inclination .",
    "two ( dm tau and ux tau a ) are transition disks and one ( bp tau ) is a class ii source . values for the inner and outer disk radii , the radius within which 80% of the emission arises , and the surface brightness power law are indicated.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in summary , our modeling of lvc nc profiles consistent with bound gas shows no difference in the radial distribution of the gas for tds and class  ii sources .",
    "given that the sub - mm dust cavity of ux tau a and dm tau are @xmath1 25au ( @xcite ) and @xmath1 19au ( @xcite ) respectively , our results also imply that the [ o  i ] 6300  nc traces gas inside the dust cavity .",
    "we find similar results for the other 2 transition disks with nc centroids consistent with bound gas , see table  [ tab : model_results ] .",
    "thus , we conclude that the [ o  i ] 6300  nc profiles of tds can be explained by radially extended [ o  i ] emission , most of which is confined within their dust cavities ( see @xcite for the dust cavities of tds ) .",
    "ratios of forbidden line equivalent widths can provide insight into the temperature and density of the lvc emitting line region . for example , the ratio of [ o  i ] 5577/6300 for one of our sources , the transition disk tw hya , with a value of @xmath11/7 @xcite , has been interpreted by @xcite as tracing the warm ( @xmath11,000k ) and bound molecular layer where oh molecules are photodissociated by fuv photons .",
    "the lvc [ o  i ] 5577/6300 ratio for the heg stars was examined by r13 who found values between @xmath11 and 1/8 for all sources except two with microjets that display smaller ratios ( @xmath10.07 ) .",
    "r13 attributed the larger ratios of 1 to 1/8 also to fuv photodissociation of oh molecules while n14 prefer the alternative possibility of thermal emission from a very hot ( @xmath15,000 - 10,000k ) and dense ( n@xmath86@xmath10 ) gas to explain similar ratios in a different sample of stars with disks .",
    "the mean ew [ o  i ] 5577/6300 ratio for the full lvc for our sample stars is 0.25 , similar to those found previously .",
    "however , with the decomposition of our high resolution spectra into bc and nc contributions to the lvc we can look to see if these two lvc components have the same ratio .",
    "there are only 4 stars where we have sufficient signal to noise in both of these lines to evaluate the [ o  i ] 5577/6300 for each component : aa  tau , bp  tau , cw  tau , gi  tau . in each case",
    "the bc ratio is a factor of a few higher than the nc ratio of [ o  i ] 5577/6300 .",
    "figure  [ fig : oiline_ratios ] compares the observed [ o  i ] 5577/6300 values for these 4 stars ( bc in red and nc in blue ) with those predicted by a homogeneous and isothermal gas where the excitation is due solely to electron collisions , see appendix  [ appendix ] for details .",
    "this figure shows that the bc emitting region is about a factor of 3 denser than the nc region if these two components arise from gas at the same temperature .",
    "alternatively , if they trace similarly dense ( @xmath87@xmath10 ) gas , the bc gas is @xmath125% hotter than the nc gas . in either scenario ,",
    "gas needs to be hot ( @xmath125,000k ) to explain the observed ratios if the lines are thermally excited . for gas at 8,000k the observed ratios can be explained by @xmath88 ranging from @xmath89 to @xmath90@xmath10 implying gas densities of a few @xmath91@xmath10 for an ionization fraction of 0.33 , close to the value expected in the [ o  i ] emitting region in some photoevaporative wind models ( see figure 2 in @xcite ) . by 5,000k electron densities",
    "become very high ( @xmath92@xmath10 ) and , as discussed in the context of tw  hya @xcite , are unlikely to be present in the hot surface of protoplanetary disks . an alternative interpretation for those sources with no definite blueshift",
    "is that the [ o  i ] emission is not thermal but results from the photodissociation of oh molecules in a cooler ( @xmath11,000k ) , bound , and mostly neutral layer of the disk @xcite .",
    "although the higher ionization [ o  ii ] 7330 line is not detected in any of our sources , we can use the upper limits to further constrain the gas temperature and density discussed above . figure  [",
    "fig : line_ratios ] shows the predicted [ o  ii ] 7330/ [ o  i ] 6300 ratios versus the [ o  i ] 5577/6300 ratios for the full lvc . as expected , since the critical electron densities for both the [ o  ii ] and [ o  i ] lines are similar ( @xmath93 @xmath10 ) , the [ o  ii]/[o  i ] ratio is most sensitive to the gas temperature , given an ionization fraction which again we take to be 0.33 . models with the same electron density ( green lines ) , but different temperatures , run diagonally in figure  [ fig : line_ratios ] .",
    "this figure shows that the gas temperature must be lower than 6,500k if a single temperature is to explain all of our [ o  ii ] 7330/ [ o  i ] 6300 upper limits , which would imply high electron densities ( @xmath94@xmath10 ) based on the [ o  i ] 5577/6300 ratios .",
    "higher temperatures are possible only in combination with an ionization fraction lower than 0.33 .",
    "as discussed earlier , it is also possible that the [ o  i ] emission is not thermal but results from the dissociation of oh molecules @xcite .",
    "a way to discriminate between thermal vs non - thermal emission would be to obtain high spectral resolution observations of the [ s  ii ] line at 4068.6  because this line has a critical density of @xmath95@xmath10 , very similar to that of the [ o  i ] line at 6300 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "similar line profiles for the [ s  ii ] and [ o  i ] lines would clearly point to thermal emission in a hot dense gas .",
    "the major contribution of this work is demonstrating that the low velocity forbidden emission in tts has kinematic properties that can be described as coming from a combination of a broad and a narrow line formation region .",
    "most of our analysis is based on characterizing the behavior of the bc and nc as though they are two physically distinct emission regions . however , based on the current data we can not assess whether they both arise from the same phenomenon from different radial ranges in the disk or whether they arise in two different formation scenarios .",
    "the most likely formation scenarios for the lvc are mass loss in the outer part of a centrifugally driven disk wind , mass loss in a photoevaporative flow , and bound gas in the disk .",
    "we first review the highlights of our findings here and then look at the merits of attributing the lvc to these scenarios .",
    "the bc of the lvc is very common , seen in 25/30 stars spanning the full range of disk accretion rates . in contrast , the nc of the lvc is somewhat less common , detected in only 18/30 stars , but again is found over the full range of disk accretion rates .",
    "of the 5 stars which show only nc emission , 4 are transition disks and the 5th transition disk ( gm aur ) , has the highest percentage of nc emission in the lvc among the sources with bc emission . if the bc comes primarily from within 0.05 to 0.5 au , as suggested by the relation between its fhwm and disk inclination , then its absence in transition disks is likely due to a paucity of significant disk gas in this region .",
    "this conclusion is in line with what has been proposed for tw  hya from detailed modeling of emission lines covering a large range of radial distances @xcite .",
    "four of our sources ( bp  tau , df  tau , fz  tau , and gi  tau ) have a redshifted hvc that might also hint to depletion in the inner disk , in this case of the dust component , which is the main source of opacity . however , their infrared indices , as reported in furlan et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , place them in the full disk portion .",
    "also their lvc are not reduced with respect to sources with no redshifted hvc ( compare bp  tau to aa  tau ) , thus viewing through a disk hole can not explain the redshifted hvc emission .    while the range of observed fwhm for the bc and the nc",
    "can be explained as a result of keplerian broadening from different radii in the disk ( between 0.05 to 0.5au for the bc and 0.5 to 5au for the nc ) , the different behaviors of their centroid velocities are the most useful in trying to understand their connection to disk winds .",
    "a basic expectation of any wind model is that not only the fwhm but also the centroid @xmath54 of a line formed in the wind will correlate ( oppositely ) with disk inclination . in a close to face - on configuration keplerian broadening is minimal and the vertical component of the wind dominates , giving rise to an asymmetric blueshifted profile . on the opposite extreme , for a close to edge - on configuration , keplerian broadening dominates and because the wind is emerging in the plane of the sky , the resulting profile is symmetric and centered at the stellar velocity ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we see the expected relations with fwhm and inclination for both the bc and nc lvc but the situation is not so clear when their centroid velocities are also considered .",
    "we illustrate the relation between all 3 quantities in figure  [ fig : eo_models ] , plotting the observed [ o  i ] 6300 fwhm vs @xmath54 for the lvc bc ( upper panel ) and nc ( lower panel ) with datapoints color - coded by disk inclination ( see section [ sect : inclination ] ) .        in the case of the bc ,",
    "we see larger fwhm associated with larger disk inclination ( vertical color gradient ) coupled with , for most of the sources , larger blueshifts for narrower lines and lower disk inclination ( horizontal color gradient ) . these are the expected behaviors for a wind .",
    "a kendall @xmath61 test gives a probability of only @xmath1 1% that the bc fwhm and @xmath54 are uncorrelated .",
    "moreover , the sources with small bc redshifts are mostly in disks seen at high inclination , where , as described in section 5.4 , an extended disk height at large radii may obscure part of the wind from the inner disk while the receding gas ( from the observer s perspective ) remains unobstructed ( gorti et al . in preparation).as",
    "the bc has the general characteristics expected for a simple wind and seems to arise in the innermost disk with maximum velocities of 10 to 27 km / s , we find it likely that the bc is the base of an mhd disk wind , since thermal speeds can not reach the necessary escape speeds this deep in the stellar gravitational potential field and photoevaporation can not occur .    in the case of the nc , plotted over a smaller range of fwhm and @xmath54 than the bc ,",
    "again we see fwhm associated with larger disk inclination ( vertical color gradient ) , however there is no relation between the @xmath54 and either the fwhm or the inclination .",
    "a kendall @xmath61 test lends to a probability of @xmath1 21% that fwhm and @xmath54 are uncorrelated , consistent with no correlation .",
    "two sources ( ds tau and dg tau ) stand out with much higher blueshifts than the rest of the nc , but one is close to face on and the other close to edge on . thus , although half of the nc have blueshifted @xmath54 , they do not behave in the manner expected for a simple wind .",
    "although figures  [ fig : inclination_plot ] and figure  [ fig : eo_models ] show a relation between fwhm and inclination in the bc and nc there is considerable scatter and a few outliers .",
    "however , we have not taken into account the fact that there will be an additional source of broadening in both the bc and nc if they are formed in outflowing gas . in the class",
    "ii sources , comprising most of our sample , a dusty disk is assumed to occult the receding flow , and the observed fwhm would come both from keplerian rotation and expanding wind streamlines , producing anomalously high line widths for certain wind geometries ( e.g. bc of dk tau and fz tau ) . in the case of the transition disks , dominated by nc lvc emission",
    ", the large dust - free cavities appear to have bound gas , although the gas is not as close in to the star to produce bc emission ( section 5 ) .",
    "however , as there would presumably be no opacity source to occult a receding flow , the nc could include a contribution from flowing gas but still be centered on the stellar velocity and the line width would be enhanced by both approaching and receding gas ( see the case of tw  hya discussed in @xcite and modeling by @xcite ) .",
    "the past decade has seen significant advancements in the theory of thermal photoevaporative flows and sophisticated models , accounting for heating by stellar x - rays , euv , and fuv photons , are now available ( e.g. @xcite for a review ) .",
    "we anticipate that these models will be soon providing more rigorous tests of whether the lvc might arise in thermal winds . theoretical models for magnetically driven centrifugal disk winds have also grown increasingly sophisticated and recently the relevance of mri - driven accretion over much of the disk has been challenged ( e.g. @xcite ) putting mhd disk winds back in the spotlight for extracting disk angular momentum to enable accretion onto the star ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "global simulations of these winds have been recently presented by @xcite and thermal - chemical models have been investigated by @xcite , but predictables that can be directly compared with observations of tts forbidden lines are still lacking .    we began this study to investigate the possibility that the lvc in tts might arise in photoevaporative flows .",
    "it seems unlikely this could be the case for the bc of the lvc , which we attribute to the base of an mhd disk wind .",
    "however , despite the lack of a convincing trend between centroid velocity and fwhm / disk inclination for the nc of the lvc we note that the _ range _ of fwhm and @xmath54 for the nc are consistent with those predicted for photoevaporative flows by @xcite . using the radiation - hydrodynamic code of @xcite , which includes x - ray and euv irradiation ,",
    "@xcite find that the [ o  i ] 6300 line is produced by collisional excitation and extends to @xmath135au above the disk , where euv photons and soft x - rays are absorbed and the gas is hot .",
    "predicted fwhm range from 8 to 32km / s while peak centroids go from 0 to -7km / s , with the largest blueshifts occurring for intermediate disk inclinations ( @xmath96 ) , contrary to a simple wind geometry .",
    "we do not see this trend either .",
    "although hydrodynamical models that can predict line profiles of flows driven by fuv photons have not been developed , the expectation is that these flows , being cooler ( @xmath11,000k ) and mostly neutral , will have smaller velocities than those driven by x - rays .",
    "the sound speed for such cool flows is only @xmath12km / s and the critical radius beyond which the gas would be unbound is @xmath110au around a solar - mass star . in this scenario ,",
    "the [ o  i ] emission will not be thermal and will arise from the dissociation of oh molecules in mostly bound gas inside of 10 au @xcite , which could explain the very small or absent blueshifts we see in many nc lines . in summary , at the present time the connection of the forbidden line nc of the lvc in tts to photoevaporative flows remains ambiguous , and we can not exclude that the nc is also part of a mhd disk wind .",
    "we have analyzed optical high - resolution ( @xmath17km / s ) spectra from a sample of 33 tts whose disks span a range of evolutionary stages to clarify the origin of the lvc from oxygen and sulfur forbidden emission lines .",
    "we detect the [ o  i ] 6300 line in 30/33 tts , the [ o  i ] 5577 line in 16/33 , and the [ s  ii ] 6730 in only 8/33 tts . after isolating the forbidden lvc emission by removing any hvc contributions ,",
    "if present , we draw the following conclusions about the residual lvc component :    * all tts with [ o  i ] detections show lvc emission .",
    "thirteen out of 30 sources with [ o  i ] 6300   emission have lvc emission that can be described as the combination of a broad ( bc ) and a narrow ( nc ) line emitting region .",
    "the remaining sources show lvc emission that is either only bc ( 12/30 ) or only nc ( 5/30 ) . *",
    "the bc of the lvc is very common , seen in 25/30 tts .",
    "the nc of the lvc is less common , seen in 18/25 tts .",
    "both components are found over the full range of accretion luminosities / disk accretion rates and their luminosities , combined or individually , correlate with the accretion luminosity .",
    "lvc that are solely or predominantly nc are usually transition disk sources .",
    "* comparison with spectra from heg shows that in most stars the lvc is stable over timescales of decades .",
    "however , we do find evidence for variations , with the lvc disappearing entirely in one star and only the nc of the lvc disappearing in another star . *",
    "the bc shows a relation between the fwhm and either observed or derived disk inclination suggesting it is broadened by keplerian rotation at disk radii between 0.05 to 0.5au .",
    "also , a significant number of bc have blueshifts in excess of 5 km / s .",
    "these larger blueshifts are associated with narrower lines and lower disk inclinations , as expected if the bc includes emission from a wind , in addition to keplerian broadening .",
    "the bc with larger blueshifts also tend to be found in sources with higher accretion luminosity and hvc emission from microjets .",
    "since the emission likely arises from 0.05 to 0.5 au , where the gravity of the star and the disk is strong , it is unlikely to trace a photoevaporative flow but rather the slower moving portion of an mhd disk wind .",
    "* the nc also shows a relation between the fwhm and either observed or derived disk inclination suggesting it is broadened by keplerian rotation at disk radii between 0.5 to 5au .",
    "half of the nc features are blueshifted between -2 to -5 km / s and the other half have centroids consistent with the stellar velocity .",
    "although the expected relation for a simple wind between disk inclination and centroid velocity is not found , we can not exclude the possibility that the nc of the lvc arises in photoevaporative flows . *",
    "regardless of the disk evolutionary stage , nc profiles consistent with bound gas can be reproduced by gas in keplerian motion with a surface brightness decreasing as a power law between 0.1au and @xmath110au , but with 80% of the emission arising within 5au .",
    "the implication for transition disks is that the nc arises from gas inside the dust cavity . *",
    "if forbidden emission lines are produced by collisional excitation with electrons , the [ o  i ] 5577/6300 ratios suggest high temperatures ( @xmath165,000k ) and large electron densities ( @xmath97@xmath10 ) . without the additional constraints on density and temperature that would be provided by high resolution spectra of the [ s  ii ] 4069 line",
    ", the possibility remains that the excitation of [ o i ] is not thermal .",
    "dissociation of oh molecules in a cool ( @xmath11,000k ) , bound , mostly neutral disk layer could be the source of the [ o i ] emission in objects with very small and absent shifts in the nc lvc .",
    "disk winds , both mhd and photoevaporative , deplete material from several scale heights above the midplane . as dust grains",
    "grow they settle toward the midplane .",
    "the implication is that disk winds mostly deplete the protoplanetary disk of gas , which consequently increases the dust - to - gas ratio with time @xcite .",
    "this increase can directly impact the formation of planetesimals , terrestrial planets , and the cores of giant planets . since disk winds play a significant role in disk dispersal and planet formation ,",
    "both models and expanded observational data sets need to pursue the origin of the lvc nc , and constrain the rate at which material is lost via disk winds .",

    "6300  before ( black ) and after ( red ) sky subtraction .",
    "note that the strong [ o  i ] terrestrial line is well removed by the makee pipeline.,width=576 ]    the keck spectra presented here were acquired in the standard mode which places the slit along the parallactic angle in order to minimize potential slit losses .",
    "this approach was taken because our main interest was to study the lvc , which was known to be compact , rather than the jet emission , which , most likely , extends beyond the slit width . for completeness , we provide in table  [ tab : pa_table ] slit position angles and disk position angles ( which should be close to 90@xmath98 of the jet position angles ) .",
    "go tau , ux tau a , and ds tau have the slit most closely aligned of a possible jet , within @xmath1 10@xmath98 , yet none of them show a jet signature in the [ o  i ] spectra .",
    "the collisional excitation model described here is used to gain physical insight in the temperature and electron density of the region traced by oxygen forbidden lines .",
    "we assume a homogeneous and isothermal slab of gas , where the excitation is due solely to electron collisions .",
    "we considered a ground state and four additional excited states ( 5-level atom ) both for the neutral and ionized oxygen .",
    "we computed the relative populations of the levels as a function of gas temperature and density by including the processes of collisional excitation , collisional de - excitation , and spontaneous radiative decay .",
    "einstein coefficients for radiative decay were taken from the nist database ] and electron collision strengths from @xcite .",
    "we have not included collisions with neutral hydrogen because the de - excitation cross section of the level @xmath99s@xmath100 is not known ( see e.g. discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "however , neutral collisions should be negligible when the electron abundance is larger than @xmath101 , as suggested by the same disk models , because the electron rate coefficients ( @xmath102@xmath103/s ) are much larger than those for h ( @xmath104@xmath103/s ) . because of the very similar ionization potential of h and o we have taken the ratio of h@xmath105/h to be equal to o@xmath105/o , equal to 0.5 for an ionization fraction of 0.33 , close to the value expected in the [ o  i ] emitting region in some photoevaporative wind models ( see figure  2 in @xcite ) .",

    "<S> using keck / hires spectra ( @xmath0 7 km / s ) we analyze forbidden lines of [ o  i ] 6300  , [ o  i ] 5577   and [ s  ii ] 6731   from 33 t tauri stars covering a range of disk evolutionary stages . after removing a high velocity component ( hvc ) associated with microjets , </S>",
    "<S> we study the properties of the low velocity component ( lvc ) . </S>",
    "<S> the lvc can be attributed to slow disk winds that could be magnetically ( mhd ) or thermally ( photoevaporative ) driven . </S>",
    "<S> both of these winds play an important role in the evolution and dispersal of protoplanetary material .    </S>",
    "<S> lvc emission is seen in all 30 stars with detected [ o  i ] but only in 2 out of eight with detected [ s  ii ] , so our analysis is largely based on the properties of the [ o  i ] lvc . the lvc itself is resolved into broad ( bc ) and narrow ( nc ) kinematic components . both components are found over a wide range of accretion rates and their luminosity is correlated with the accretion luminosity , but the nc is proportionately stronger than the bc in transition disks .    the fwhm of both the bc and nc correlates with disk inclination , consistent with keplerian broadening from radii of 0.05 to 0.5 au and 0.5 to 5au , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity centroids of the bc suggest formation in an mhd disk wind , with the largest blueshifts found in sources with closer to face - on orientations . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity centroids of the nc however , show no dependence on disk inclination . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of this component is less clear and the evidence for photoevaporation is not conclusive . </S>"
