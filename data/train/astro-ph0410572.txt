    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) are much closer to us than ngc  6822 .",
    "however , they reside so close to the galaxy that the star forming process may be influenced by the tidal force associated with the galactic gravitational field . on the contrary ,",
    "ngc  6822 is far more isolated and star formation processes are dictated only by the local conditions in ngc  6822 itself .",

    "v is the brightest hii region complex in ngc  6822 .",

    "the core contains a compact cluster of bright blue stars .",
    "the halo is overlaid on to the eastern part of the ob association , hodge ob 8 @xcite .",

    "@xcite observed hubble v in co emission at high spatial resolution ( 6.2 x 11.1 arcsec ) and reported finding a molecular cloud complex in the hubble v region ( fig .",

    "@xcite found a compact source of @xmath9-band emission to the south of the visual core .",
    "this @xmath9-band peak is not seen in the visual images so they argued that it could be another compact star cluster that is highly obscured by the dark cloud .    in this paper",
    ", we present the results of our near - infrared ( near - ir ) observations of ngc  6822 hubble v at high spatial resolutions .",
    "the observations and data reduction are described in section  [ observation ] .",
    "we present the morphology of the ionized region and photo - dissociation region ( pdr ) and the physical conditions in the pdr in section  [ results ] . in section  [ discussion ]",
    "we derive some physical parameters by comparing our observations with predictions of a pdr model @xcite .",
    "we also compare with previous co observations to illustrate the structure of the molecular clouds and discuss the evolution of the hubble v star forming region .",
    "we observed the ngc  6822 hubble v field at the 3.8 m united kingdom infra - red telescope ( ukirt ) in hawaii on 2001 june 24 and 2004 july 6 ( ut ) , using the cooled grating spectrometer 4 ( cgs4 ; @xcite ) .",
    "cgs4 was set up with the 300 mm focal length camera optics and the long slit of about 90 arcsec .",
    "the observations were obtained at both low and high spectral resolution : slit scanning at low spectral resolution with the 40 line mm@xmath10 ( hereafter l / mm ) grating was followed by a high resolution spectrum with the echelle grating .",
    "the details are described in the following subsections .",
    "initial data reduction steps , involving bias - subtraction and flat - fielding ( using an internal blackbody lamp ) , were accomplished by the automated observatory reduction and acquisition control ( orac ) pipeline at ukirt .",
    "iraf was used for the remainder of the reduction .",
    "we corrected the spectral distortion along the dispersion axis using the spectrum of the standard star bs 7658 as a template .",
    "the sky oh lines for the echelle observation and argon lines for the 40 l / mm observation were then used to correct for spatial distortion perpendicular to this axis and to wavelength calibrate the data .",
    "the telescope was nodded between on - source positions and carefully - selected sky positions outside of ngc  6822 ; the sky frames were subtracted from the on - source frames to remove oh sky lines .",
    "residual sky lines were removed by using blank areas on the spectral images ; after subtraction of the sky lines , weak emission of @xmath11 remained at measurable levels . at the high spectral resolving power of the echelle grating the target h@xmath2 lines",
    "were well separated from the brightest oh lines so these data do not suffer from this contamination .",
    "details pertaining to the low and high - resolution spectroscopic observations are given below .",
    "we obtained @xmath9-band spectra ( 1.8 - 2.4 @xmath0 ) with low spectral resolution ( @xmath12 720 - 960 ) using a 40 l / mm grating and a one - pixel - wide ( 0.61 arcsec ) slit .",

    "the slit was oriented @xmath15 east of north for each measurement ; adjacent slit positions were separated by 1.2 arcsec perpendicular to the slit length .",
    "the pixel size along the slit was 0.61 arcsec and the seeing was less than 0.44 arcsec .",
    "the image quality is degraded , however , through the optical system of cgs4 and the final spatial resolution was about 1 arcsec ( 2.4 pc at the distance of ngc  6822 ) according to the fwhm of the flux profile of the standard star along the slit .",
    "a three dimensional data cube was made by stacking the 12 spectral images that resulted from the slit scanning . from this cube",
    "we extracted images of the scanned field in individual emission lines .",
    "continuum levels were measured on either side ( short - ward and long - ward in wavelength ) of each line so that the continuum emission could be accurately subtracted from each image .",

    "seeing was about 0.75 arcsec , but the final spatial resolution after the cgs4 s optics was 2.1 arcsec ( 5.0 pc ) for @xmath11 and 1.7 arcsec ( 4.1 pc ) for @xmath3 .",

    "the average intensity ( @xmath23 1 ( @xmath270.1 ) @xmath28 @xmath29 ; not corrected for interstellar extinction ) of our observed @xmath11 lines is consistent with the intensity ( @xmath23 0.9 ( @xmath270.2 ) @xmath30 @xmath31 ) measured by @xcite using a large , single aperture of 19.6 arcsec in diameter .",
    "the intensities and ratios in table  [ tbl_fit ] are corrected for the interstellar extinction .",
    "the adapted foreground reddening @xmath32 to the hubble v field is 0.65 mag ( a@xmath33 2.02 mag ) which is suggested by @xcite who compare the radio continuum flux - densities at 1.5 , 4.8 , and 10.7 ghz to the h@xmath18 flux .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     as for gas density , a more precise comparison is possible with the @xmath34 / @xmath4 ratio .",
    "the ratio is insensitive to @xmath35 and can be regarded as a function of @xmath36 when @xmath37 ( see figs  11  &  12 of @xcite ) . for the case of radiative fluorescent emission ( @xmath38 ) ,",
    "the line ratios depend on the branching ratios of the radiative cascade . at @xmath39 , where the collisional deexcitation becomes important , and at @xmath40 with @xmath37 , where the gas becomes warm enough for collisions to dominate the excitation of the @xmath41 levels",
    ", @xmath35 does not influence the collisional processes .",
    "our observational results for the h@xmath2 emission point to a collision - dominated model with @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "this means that the region around the core of hubble v is equivalent to a dense and warm pdr , where most of the h@xmath2 molecules excited by far - uv photons are collisionally de - excited and collisional processes contribute significantly to the excitation of the @xmath41 level .    using the measured radio continuum flux and an assumed hii region radius of 20 pc",
    ", @xcite found that the molecular gas at the pdr interface is illuminated by a uv field strength @xmath44 .",
    "however , according to the observed distribution of the @xmath11 emission in this study the front - end of the interface seems to be much closer to the uv sources , at a distance of about 4 pc .",
    "if this is the case , the uv flux could be as high as @xmath45 , which is consistent with our expectation at position d assuming the higher extinction . by comparing the observed co line ratios with the pdr model of @xcite",
    ", @xcite also suggested a gas density of about @xmath46 .",
    "this is consistent again with our estimate to within an order of magnitude .",
    "the @xcite model used above adopts a metallicity appropriate for our own galaxy , whereas our observational results are for the much lower metallicity environment of ngc  6822 .",
    "@xcite considered a wide range of metallicity in their pdr model , but they present no prediction for the h@xmath2 emission . in the case of radiative fluorescence with a density of @xmath47 , the column density , line intensity , and line ratios of h@xmath2",
    "are known to be nearly insensitive to metallicity @xcite .",
    "our global view of the distribution of the h@xmath2 emission is consistent with the co map of @xcite . both of the h@xmath2 features seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_imap](f ) , the feature surrounding the core and the feature extended into the northwestern halo , could be interpreted as being related to the mc2 cloud of @xcite . as for detailed structure ,",
    "however , this consistency is not maintained .",
    "the co @xmath48 brightness decreases from the north to the south by a factor of 2 or 3 ( see fig .  1 of @xcite ) , while the @xmath11 intensity in the south is as bright as the emission in the north ( see table  [ tbl_fit ] ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of estimated gas density is shown in table  [ tbl_model ] the gas density seems to increase slightly from the north to the south .",
    "the lower limit at our most southern position ( e ) suggests that the gas density does not decrease towards the south .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite s assumption of high obscuration to the south .",
    "however , the @xmath11 intensity rapidly decreases at the southern - most position .",
    "this contradiction may be explained if the molecular cloud is dense but has a sharp edge to the south .",
    "the deficiency of the co @xmath48 emission to the south can be caused by a geometrical effect .",
    "the co @xmath48 emission is radiated from surfaces of co cores since the transition is optically thick , so the intensity highly depends on the sizes of the co cores . in a smaller molecular cloud or under a more intense uv radiation field where photo - dissociation makes co cores smaller , the co intensity should be fainter .",
    "hence , if we assume that the southern part of the hubble v molecular cloud has as high a density as , but a relatively smaller extent than , the northern part , and it is illuminated by the obscured star cluster which is brighter than the visual cluster , then the co @xmath48 emission should be significantly reduced at this region .",
    "@xcite surveyed 34 galactic open clusters searching for co clouds around each of the clusters .",
    "they found that younger clusters are associated with larger number of more massive and bigger molecular clouds and that the clouds are receding from each of the young clusters .",
    "@xcite suggested that the molecular clouds should be destroyed by their interaction with newborn , hot stars and further star formation be prevented in the cluster ; massive o stars can rapidly dissolve the associated clouds by eroding the cloud surfaces with their intense radiation and by accelerating the clouds systematically with their stellar winds or via a `` rocket effect '' from evaporated gases @xcite .",
    "we can surmise the evolutionary stage of the hubble v complex by applying its properties to @xcite s empirical relation on the cloud evolution .",
    "@xcite estimated the virial masses of the hubble v molecular clouds , mc1 and mc2 , to be @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively . if we adopt @xcite s estimations , the hubble v clouds seem to be consistent with the galactic clouds with similar ages of about 4 myr on the evolutionary relation ( see figs 43 & 47 of @xcite ) , both in the mass and in the proximity to the cluster ; the hubble v cluster is overlaid by the molecular clouds along the line of sight .    at first glance",
    ", the sizes of the hubble v clouds ( @xmath51 18 pc and 52 pc for mc1 and mc2 , respectively , along the major axes ) , reported by @xcite , also look consistent with @xcite s relation .",
    "however , the hubble v clouds should in fact be significantly larger than the galactic co clouds with similar ages , since a cloud size is defined by the fwhm of the co intensity profile in @xcite , while @xcite defined the size using the lowest contour , which is much larger than the fwhm size . considering the low metallicity of hubble v ( with 2 times smaller [ o / h ] than the galactic value )",
    ", it seems consistent with @xcite s prediction that the typical size of the star forming clouds increases as the metallicity decreases .",
    "we performed near - ir spectroscopic observations of the hubble v complex , the brightest hii region complex in the dwarf irregular galaxy ngc  6822 .    from low spectral resolution ( @xmath52 ) @xmath9-band ( 1.8 - 2.4 @xmath0 ) slit scanning , we obtained high spatial resolution ( @xmath23 1 arcsec ) maps of the region in 2.2 @xmath0 continuum , 2.0587 @xmath0 he i , 2.1661 @xmath0 br@xmath1 , and 2.1218 @xmath0 @xmath11 emission .",
    "the morphology of hubble v in the near - ir is typical of hii regions / pdrs ; the compact he i and br@xmath1 emitting region is surrounded by the h@xmath2 emitting region .",
    "the detailed distribution of the h@xmath2 emission in hubble v is observed for the first time .",
    "our high spectral resolution observations ( @xmath53 ) of the @xmath11 and @xmath34 lines , when combined with our excitation analysis , indicate that the region around the core of hubble v is a dense pdr and suggest that there is no significant shock activity .",
    "the moderate @xmath34 / @xmath4 ratios ( 0.2  0.6 ) are explained by high densities ( @xmath54 ) and the possibility of shocks are excluded by the gas kinematics .",
    "the h@xmath2 lines have the same systematic velocity as the cold molecular gas ( traced by co ) and the line profiles are spectrally unresolved .",
    "this conclusion implies that there is no detectable yso activity around the core of hubble v.    by comparing the observed results with a pdr model , we estimate a gas density of @xmath42 and incident uv field strength of @xmath43 .",
    "this means that the environment around the core of hubble v is dense and warm enough so that most of the h@xmath2 molecules excited by far - uv photons are collisionally de - excited and the excitation to the @xmath41 level is dominated by collisions .",
    "the physical parameters estimated in this work are consistent with those independently derived by @xcite ; the strength of the uv field estimated from radio continuum flux densities and the gas density estimated from co line ratios assuming a pdr environment .",
    "the distribution of the near - ir continuum and the line emission from the ionized regions in the southern part of hubble v confirm the existence of a hidden star cluster inside a dark molecular cloud .",
    "hubble v seems to be in the early stage of molecular cloud dissolution after having finished its star formation activity @xmath55 myr ago .",
    "but the progress of evolution seems slower than in the galaxy , due to the intrinsically larger sizes and masses of the molecular clouds .",
    "we thank thor wold , watson varricattu , and all the related ukirt staffs for their excellent supports for our successful observations .",
    "we also deeply appreciate the efforts of marc seigar and paul hirst for the service observations which make our survey complete .",
    "kind answers from andy adamson , paul hirst , and tom kerr about the cgs4 were critically helpful for this work .",

    "<S> most of the h@xmath2 molecules are excited by far - uv photons ( with a field strength of @xmath6 times that of the average interstellar field ) , although collisional processes de - excite h@xmath2 and contribute significantly to the excitation of the first vibrational level . </S>",
