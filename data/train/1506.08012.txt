    "forced systems can display unexpected behaviour in the extreme cases in which the oscillation of the forcing is either very slow or very fast .",
    "it is well known that , in such situations , the dynamics can be strikingly different with respect to the case in which the forcing period is comparable with that of the unperturbed motions @xcite .",
    "a classical example is provided by the pendulum with oscillating support @xcite . the standard technique used to attack",
    "the problem is the averaging method ; however , a rigorous implementation is quite not trivial , as it involves dealing with small divisor problems .",
    "indeed , the main idea underlying the averaging is that the forced system , in suitable coordinates , can be considered as a perturbation of an integrable system , so that kam - like arguments apply @xcite .    for a periodically forced system ,",
    "if the amplitude of the forcing is small , then the kam theorem yields that most of the unperturbed tori persist . on the basis of heuristic arguments",
    ", one expects that something of the same kind still occurs even when the amplitude of the forcing is not small , provided its frequency is large or small enough .",
    "such an expectation is ultimately based on averaging arguments .",
    "however , to reduce the problem to results available in the literature requires some analysis .",
    "since this has not been done explicitly , as far as we are aware of , we think it may be of interest to discuss how the argument works .",
    "the case of large frequency can be reduced quite easily to neishdatd s averaging theorem . however , at a certain point , we shall need an additional close - to - identity transformation which strongly relies one the one - dimensionality of the system ( more precisely on its integrability ) .",
    "the case of low frequency is related to the problem of boundedness of the solutions of forced systems in phase space @xcite . however , to prove boundedness one has to prove the existence of confining kam tori far away from the origin .",
    "hence only the asymptotic behaviour of the potential really counts , and in general one needs a condition on the growth of the potential at infinity  besides smoothness conditions , see @xcite . on the contrary , to study the existence of kam tori in a fixed region of phase space of a forced system , one needs information about the potential in that region : this explains why the assumptions we shall require on the potential are stronger , as they are not just asymptotic properties .    for clarity purposes , in this paper we focus on a case study , the forced cubic oscillator , which has been extensively investigated in the literature all along as a paradigmatic model @xcite .",
    "we shall prove that most of the phase space is filled by kam invariant tori when the period of the forcing is sufficiently large or sufficiently small .",
    "in particular we find that this happens for values of the forcing amplitude far beyond the perturbation regime .",
    "furthermore , we provide numerical results which strongly suggest that the amplitude can be allowed to be still larger than the analytical bounds .",
    "we leave as an open problem how to improve the analytical bounds , so as to give full explanation of the numerical findings .",
    "we briefly discuss at the end how to relax the assumptions on the potential and extend the results to more general systems .    a cubic oscillator subject to a periodic driving force",
    "is described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 denotes the time , the _ driving force _",
    "@xmath3 is a @xmath4-periodic analytic function of its argument , with zero average and @xmath5 ; @xmath6 and @xmath7 are , respectively , the _ amplitude _ and the _ frequency _ of the driving force . the phase space for the system is @xmath8 , with @xmath9 and the corresponding equations of motion are @xmath10 where the dot denotes derivative with respect to @xmath2 .    for @xmath11",
    "the system is integrable , so that the full phase space is filled by invariant tori , with @xmath2 increasing linearly in time with frequency @xmath12 and @xmath13 moving on a closed orbit @xmath14 in the plane with frequency @xmath15 depending on the initial data .",
    "fix arbitrarily @xmath16 and consider , for the unperturbed cubic oscillator , the closed , concentric orbits @xmath17 and @xmath18 which run with frequencies @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "call @xmath21 the bounded region enclosed between @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and set @xmath22 .",
    "the reasons behind the choice of the domain @xmath23 are the following : we want to fix a bounded region in phase space so as to estimate the relative measure of the persisting tori ( the curve @xmath18 is a natural boundary for such a region ) and at any rate one is forced to exclude a small region around the origin , where chaotic dynamics may become dominant ( the role of the internal curve @xmath17 is just to cut off such a small region since the beginning ) .    for @xmath24 small enough , we can apply kam theorem @xcite , so as to obtain the persistence of most of the invariant tori inside @xmath23 , independently of the value of the frequency @xmath25 ( and of the value of @xmath19 as well : @xmath19 can be taken arbitrarily small ) .",
    "[ thm:1 ] for @xmath24 small enough the set of persisting invariant tori in @xmath23 for the system with hamiltonian leaves out a set with relative measure @xmath26 .    in this note",
    "we want to show that the similar results still hold when removing the condition of smallness on @xmath24 , provided the frequency @xmath25 is either large enough or small enough .",
    "this will be discussed , respectively , in section [ sec:2 ] and section [ sec:3 ] . in particular , by increasing @xmath27 from @xmath28 to infinity , a double transition regularity - chaos - regularity is expected to occur .",
    "we support such an expectation by providing in section [ sec:4 ] numerical results , which also give evidence that the regularity regime extends to wider ranges of the parameters for which the analytical results do not apply .",
    "finally in section [ sec:5 ] we discuss how to extend our analysis to more general systems .",
    "we consider first the case of @xmath25 large and we set @xmath29 , with @xmath30 small .",
    "we can formulate our result for such a case in a more general context . in action - angle variables ,",
    "the hamiltonian becomes @xmath31 where @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote respectively the cosine - amplitude function and the complete elliptic integral of the first kind with elliptic modulus @xmath37 .",
    "the corresponding hamilton equations are @xmath38 where @xmath39 . in terms of the variables",
    "@xmath40 the domain @xmath23 defined in section [ sec:1 ] becomes @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 , with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "more generally we shall consider hamiltonians of the form and make the following assumptions on @xmath46 and @xmath47  trivially satisfied in the case .",
    "[ hyp:1 ] assume the hamiltonian function to be real - analytic in a domain @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is an open subset of @xmath50 .",
    "[ hyp:2 ] assume @xmath51 to be a local diffeomorphism on @xmath49 .",
    "[ hyp:3 ] assume @xmath52 , @xmath53 .    in rescale time @xmath54 .",
    "then the equations of motion become @xmath55 where now the dot denotes derivative with respect to time @xmath56 .",
    "we can apply neishtadt s averaging theorem @xcite to cast the system into the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are suitable analytic functions , with @xmath60 and @xmath59 an exponentially small remainder , that is @xmath61 for some positive constants @xmath62 and @xmath63 . the change of coordinates is canonical and @xmath30-close to the identity . in order not to overwhelm the notations ,",
    "we denote the new variables with the same letters as the old ones .    by hypothesis [ hyp:3 ] the average of @xmath64 vanishes , hence @xmath58 is a correction of order @xmath30 to @xmath46 .",
    "so one can perform a further close - to - identity change of coordinates which leads to the equations @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 is still exponentially small ( and again we still denote by @xmath68 the transformed coordinates ) .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is @xmath69 the overall change of coordinates leading to is close to the identity within @xmath70 and hence , up to a region with measure @xmath71 , the domain @xmath72 is transformed into a region enclosed between two kam invariant tori . by studying the hamiltonian @xmath73 we see that we can apply once more kam theorem and conclude that most of the unperturbed tori for the hamiltonian @xmath74 persist when the perturbation @xmath75 is switched on . since now the perturbation is exponentially small , the relative measure of the tori which are destroyed is exponentially small in @xmath30 . to go back to the original coordinates , we have to scale back time .",
    "so we obtain the following result .",
    "[ thm:2 ] consider the system with hamiltonian and assume hypotheses [ hyp:1 ] to [ hyp:3 ] . for any value of @xmath24",
    ", for @xmath25 large enough the domain @xmath72 is filled by kam invariant tori , up to a region whose relative measure is @xmath76 . apart from a thin region close to the boundary , the invariant tori leave out a region with measure exponentially small in @xmath77 .",
    "note that hypothesis [ hyp:3 ] is needed here , contrary to theorem [ thm:1 ] , to ensure that the averaged system is integrable ( such a condition is automatically satisfied for @xmath78 small , without any assumption on @xmath64 ) .",
    "now consider with @xmath79",
    ". we can reason as in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "fix @xmath80 , so that @xmath81 .",
    "we rewrite the equations of motion as @xmath82 then the argument proceeds through the following steps .    first , through a time - dependent canonical change of coordinates @xmath83 , with @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the sine - amplitude and delta - amplitude functions with modulus @xmath87 , respectively , one writes as the hamilton equations corresponding to the hamiltonian    [ eq:3.3 ] @xmath88    where @xmath89 and @xmath34 .",
    "next , in order to eliminate the dependence on time in the leading term one makes the change of coordinates @xmath90 , with @xmath91 which leads to the hamiltonian    [ eq:3.5 ] @xmath92    for some function @xmath93 of order 1 in @xmath30 .",
    "then one may perform a further change of variables @xmath94 into action - angle variables for @xmath95 , so yielding the hamiltonian    [ eq:3.6 ] @xmath96    for a suitable function @xmath97 of order 1 in @xmath30 .",
    "finally we integrate the hamiltonian equations corresponding to between @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "denote by @xmath100 the solution ; then , defining @xmath101 and setting @xmath102 and @xmath103 , we obtain the twist map @xmath104 for suitable analytic functions @xmath105 and @xmath106",
    ".    therefore we can apply moser s twist theorem and conclude that any invariant curve with diophantine rotation number persists for @xmath30 small enough . for fixed @xmath30 , the relative measure of the persisting curves in a given region of the cylinder",
    "is @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "note that , in order to prove just boundedness of the solutions , it would be enough to prove the existence of an invariant circle of constant type ( as sometimes done in the literature , see for instance @xcite ; see also the comments in @xcite ) . on the contrary , to prove that the persisting tori have large measure for @xmath30 small",
    ", a milder diophantine condition is required ; one could even allow a bryuno condition on the rotation number @xcite , as done in @xcite , but this would not increase appreciably the measure of the invariant curves .",
    "coming back to the original coordinates we obtain the existence of a large measure set of invariant tori for the continuous flow which has the twist map as poincar section at times multiples of @xmath4 .",
    "we can summarise the discussion by the following statement .",
    "[ thm:3 ] consider the system with hamiltonian and fix @xmath108 . for @xmath25 small enough",
    "the domain @xmath72 is filled by kam invariant tori , up to a region whose relative measure is @xmath109 .",
    "numerically we may illustrate the scenarios considered in the previous sections as well as provide some insight into cases which are not covered by the analysis .",
    "we study the system with @xmath110 .",
    "in particular we consider three situations , @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , with both high and low frequency forcing .    to check the stability of the dynamics we take 10 000 pseudo - random initial conditions within a square @xmath114\\times[-2,2]$ ] from the phase plane @xmath13 .",
    "the chosen numerical integration method is a strmer - verlet scheme with variable step size .",
    "the strmer - verlet method is a second order symplectic scheme , details of which may be found in @xcite .",
    "after an initial transient period , the trajectories are checked to ascertain how their asymptotic behaviour has changed with respect to the trajectories of the unperturbed system with the same initial conditions .",
    "if most of the orbits have remained close to the corresponding orbits of the unperturbed system , then we say that the system is  stable \" .",
    "this is expected to occur when the system is well within the kam regime : the majority of the unperturbed tori persist slightly deformed , so that every orbit either lies on a torus or is trapped between two surviving tori .",
    "however it is possible that the trajectories of the perturbed system do not remain close , but are still bounded .",
    "this can happen as we are moving out of the kam regime : most of the tori are destroyed , with a few of them still existing and undergoing much larger deformations .",
    "we refer to such a case by saying that the system is  bounded \" .",
    "numerically it is difficult to classify trajectories as unbounded , as a trajectory which appears unbounded may be bounded within a very large region .",
    "therefore , pragmatically , we class the trajectories as unbounded once their amplitude exceeds 30 in either the @xmath115 or @xmath116 direction , and class the system as  unbounded \" if any trajectory is found to be so .",
    "when this happens , nearly all ( if not all ) kam tori are expected to be destroyed , at least in the region investigated , otherwise any of them would confine the orbits inside .",
    "we note , however , that , even though kam theory no longer applies in this case , one can still have invariant curves of a different kind , such as cantori ( see for instance @xcite ) , so that it is quite possible for some trajectories to be unbounded whilst others remain bounded ( and possibly not too far from those of the unperturbed system ) .",
    "first we consider the scenario where @xmath111 , in particular we choose @xmath117 , 0.9 and 0.95 ; some numerical results are shown in table [ tablemulessthan1 ] .",
    "for @xmath27 sufficiently large or small , as proved in the previous sections , the dynamics are stable , whilst between these two extremes the system loses stability .    in figure [ figuremulessthan1 ]",
    "we show some example orbits corresponding to the initial conditions @xmath118 with @xmath119 in figure [ figuremulessthan1](a ) and @xmath117 in ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "it may be seen that the perturbed orbits remain close to the unperturbed system for suitable @xmath27 . with @xmath24 getting close to @xmath12 ,",
    "one has to take @xmath25 increasingly small or increasingly large for the system to be stable .",
    "+    the results in table [ tablemulessthan1 ] show that for @xmath117 the system becomes unstable when @xmath120 .",
    "we see in figure [ poincarefigure](b ) and ( c ) that as @xmath27 increases from 0.2 to 0.4 , many of the tori are broken and cantori appear , separating the few persisting kam tori and creating larger and larger gaps . however , as quite a few tori still persist in the region investigated , the orbits remain bounded . increasing @xmath27 further causes more of the kam tori to break up and for @xmath121 the orbits are no longer bounded in the region @xmath122\\times[-30,30]$ ] .",
    "analogous considerations apply to the other values of @xmath24 : the closer the amplitude @xmath24 is to 1 , the more extreme @xmath27 must be for the system to be stable .    for @xmath123 the analysis in the previous sections",
    "can only be applied when the system undergoes high frequency forcing .",
    "numerically we find that the system is also stable with low frequency forcing , however @xmath27 must be taken considerably smaller than the cases where @xmath111 .",
    "this is not true for high frequency forcing , where similar orders of @xmath27 ( compared with the cases where @xmath80 ) are sufficient for the dynamics to become stable .",
    "some numerical results are presented in table [ tablemumorethan1 ] . in figure [ figuremumorethan1 ]",
    "we show some example orbits with @xmath124 .    similarly to the case where @xmath111 it is evident that the perturbed orbits remain close to that of the unperturbed system provided @xmath27",
    "is suitably chosen . in figure",
    "[ figuremumorethan1](f ) we see that , although the system is classed as unbounded for @xmath125 and @xmath126 , it is still possible to find initial conditions for which the orbit remains close to the unperturbed system .",
    "more generally the hamiltonian of a forced cubic oscillator is @xmath127 however the writing is not restrictive , since we can reduce to that form by rescaling both variables @xmath115 and @xmath116 and redefining the parameter @xmath24 .",
    "other generalisations can be easily envisaged .",
    "for instance any potential @xmath128 yielding closed orbits in a region encircling the origin can be considered . in particular",
    "one can take a potential @xmath129 instead of @xmath130 : the unperturbed system is still integrable , so that the analysis of section [ sec:2 ] applies immediately .",
    "also the discussion in section [ sec:3 ] can be easily adapted to cover such a case ; we refer to @xcite for details .",
    "also , less regularity can be required for the driving force .",
    "finally , one could consider quasi - periodically forced systems , as in @xcite , in the case in which all components of the frequency vectors are small or large .",
    "coming back to our system , the condition that @xmath3 has zero average could be relaxed .",
    "in fact , for theorem [ thm:2 ] to hold , what we really need is that @xmath131 , so that the averaged system is integrable .",
    "on the other hand , theorem [ thm:3 ] requires @xmath132 .",
    "thus , if @xmath133 and @xmath5 , this excludes the case @xmath134 .",
    "however , if the average of @xmath135 is positive , one can argue that the potential remains positive for most of time , so one can conjecture that the condition @xmath136 might be sufficient in the low frequency regime as well . as discussed in section [ sec:4 ] , we have found numerically that also in such a case the orbits are stable if the forcing frequency is sufficiently low",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate the issue in more detail by means of analysis ."
