    "an important step toward a complete understanding of the formation , structure , and composition of interstellar dust is the study and discrimination of factors that produce changes in the observed wavelength - dependent extinction of stars due to grains .",
    "the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc , respectively ) are metal - poor relative to the galaxy ; recent estimates imply that the lmc and smc have overall metallicities at levels 0.5 and 0.20.25 , respectively , of the galactic ism @xcite .",
    "dust - to - gas ratios determined for these galaxies , as represented by @xmath4 ( ) , are also reduced ( by factors of about 4 and 10 ; @xcite ) , indicating that lmc and smc dust components and their formation mechanisms are not inconsistent with galactic components and mechanisms .",
    "nevertheless , there are differences in extinction among these three galaxies .",
    "early investigations of the extinction properties of magellanic cloud dust identified several sight lines that exhibited marked differences from curves produced by grains in the milky way ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it was noted in comparing these curves that the 2175  bump strength was reduced in the lmc relative to the galaxy , and somewhat further diminished for curves characteristic of the smc .",
    "similarly , the fuv rise evident in lmc and smc extinction curves is stronger than that common in the galaxy .",
    "subsequent studies have identified regional variation in magellanic cloud curves , associating a distinctive lmc wavelength dependence with the supershell lmc2 @xcite , a steeper uv curve with the star - forming bar region of the smc , and extinction more closely resembling galactic curves with other portions of the clouds .",
    "recently , @xcite ( hereafter g03 ) completed a comprehensive comparison of galactic , lmc , and smc extinction curves from near - infrared to ultraviolet ( uv ) wavelengths ( @xmath5 1150  or @xmath6 ) ; g03 confirmed that curves characteristic of the lmc2 grouping and the smc bar do not conform to the @xcite ( ccm ) parameterization of galactic extinction based on @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "the strength of their uv extinction is a key feature distinguishing lmc , smc , and galactic curves ; in particular , the steeper short - wavelength slopes associated with magellanic cloud extinction curves can be diagnostic of differences in dust compositions and grain size distributions , given appropriate measures of elemental abundances in their respective interstellar media @xcite .",
    "however , the extension of magellanic cloud extinction curves into the fuv ( @xmath8 8.7 @xmath9 ) is complicated by the requirement that interstellar h@xmath0 absorption be removed from the spectra before an extinction curve can be produced using the pair method .",
    "previous efforts in this area , even for milky way sight lines , have been hampered by a lack of high quality data .",
    "in particular , instrumental issues of scattered light , time - variable sensitivity , and a limited sample ( both target and comparison objects ) restricted the utility of the _ copernicus _ dataset ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) , the _ voyager _ uvs data suffer from low resolution which prevents explicit identification and removal of the molecular hydrogen contribution , and the remaining available data [ e.g. , rocket - @xcite ; _ hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ) _ - @xcite ; _ orbiting retrievable far and extreme ultraviolet spectrometer ( orfeus ) _ - @xcite ] include only a few galactic sight lines .",
    "_ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _",
    ", however , has revolutionized our ability to study interstellar molecular hydrogen .",
    "its combination of slightly better spectral resolution and much greater detector sensitivity than _ copernicus _ allows h@xmath0 to be detected throughout much larger and more diverse portions of the galaxy and even in the magellanic clouds @xcite .",
    "thus , _ fuse _ data are uniquely suited to investigating the fuv extinction properties of milky way , lmc , and smc sight lines and what any differences reveal about the dust populations in each galaxy .",
    "recently , @xcite used a modified maximum entropy method ( mem ) to fit extinction components to ir through uv curves for stars both in the galaxy and in the clouds ; they demonstrated that the average smc bar extinction curve was best fit using a grain distribution in which small silicate and amorphous carbon grains play a much larger role than in the mean galactic extinction .",
    "however , this result is at odds with @xcite , whose data suggested negligible silicon depletion in several gas cloud components along a sight line probing the smc ism . in order to address issues such as dust composition , particularly for small grains enhancing fuv extinction in the clouds",
    ", it would be helpful to explore lmc and smc extinction curves shortward of the uv range that @xcite were confined to by their _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _ data ; unfortunately , fuv extinction curves have been published to date for only very few reddened magellanic cloud stars @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we construct new extinction curves for nine pairs of reddened and unreddened lmc and smc stars by supplementing the ir through uv curves published by g03 with recent _ fuse _ observations of 16 magellanic cloud targets .",
    "the _ fuse _ data allow us to extend the @xcite analysis of dust composition and grain size distribution to fuv wavelengths , where extinction is dominated by small grains and the differences between galactic and magellanic cloud curves are particularly prominent .",
    "this is the second in a series of three papers exploring extinction in the fuv .",
    "paper i @xcite dealt with a small set of galactic extinction curves characterized by a broad range of @xmath10-values ; paper iii ( in preparation ) will examine a much larger sample of galactic sight lines in an effort to search rigorously for any trends among observed extinction parameters when fuv data are fully considered .",
    "the present sample of 16 lmc and smc stars includes all stars in the _ fuse _ archive for which the spectral match between the reddened and unreddened stars has been rigorously evaluated and there exist spectral data from ir to uv wavelengths .",
    "each reddened star has previously been studied by g03 ; we use the same photometry sources and procedures to construct the ir to uv portions of the extinction curves for the pairs adopted in this study , with the exception that early 2mass photometry has been superseded in our analysis by data from the recent _ all sky release_. in particular , it should be noted that the @xmath10 values listed in table  [ exttab ] , which summarizes the properties of each extinction pair , differ slightly from those published by g03 due to this update of the ir data .",
    "consequently , the values of @xmath11 and @xmath2()/@xmath11 in the table are also affected .",
    "the fuv portions of the extinction curves ( shortward of the ly@xmath12 line ) were derived from the new and archival _ fuse _ observations listed in table  [ obstab ] .",
    "all of the raw data were processed using the latest release of calfuse ( v3.0 ) .",
    "the calibrated spectra for each channel were cross - correlated , shifted to a common wavelength scale , and combined based on exposure time in cases where several observations of a star existed . also ,",
    "in cases where the different observations or different _ fuse _ channels produced conflicting flux levels for a given wavelength ( e.g. , due to channel misalignment ) , the data for these observations or channels were linearly adjusted to match the maximum observed flux across the regions of overlap .",
    "general details on _ fuse _ observations have been published by @xcite .",
    "we point out here , however , that each observation produces eight spectra nearly 100  in length with individual dispersion characteristics .",
    "the lif channel spectra ( lif1a , lif1b , lif2a , lif2b ) cover most wavelengths from 9901190  twice over ; the spectral region from 9101110  are similarly sampled by the sic channels ( sic1a , sic1b , sic2a , sic2b ) .",
    "sample spectra of both poor and fine quality appear in figure  [ spectra ] , using the data from the reddened star azv 456 and its comparison star azv 70 , respectively .",
    "strong fuv h@xmath0 absorption bands can significantly alter the appearance of stellar spectra , depending upon the column density of molecular gas along the line of sight .",
    "consequently , a molecular hydrogen model was constructed for each sight line using procedures patterned generally after those used by @xcite .",
    "the underlying assumption we made in measuring the interstellar h@xmath0 for each sight line was that the model includes only two velocity components , one corresponding to milky way gas and one associated with h@xmath0 in the appropriate magellanic cloud .",
    "the equivalent width measurements for distinct profiles of each component were entered into separate tables , so that molecular hydrogen measurements could be made individually for each galaxy using a curve - of - growth ( cog ) analysis .",
    "unfortunately , the velocity separation of galactic and magellanic cloud components often resulted in blended absorption profiles at several points in a given spectrum . in general , the construction of a reasonable cog for most of the sight lines required more equivalent width measurements than were available from the unblended and isolated h@xmath0 absorption lines . to remedy this problem , the profile - fitting code fits6p - values , and velocities of input interstellar components .",
    "more details on the algorithm can be found in @xcite . ] and iraf plotting routines were used in conjunction with our idl code @xcite to deconvolve blended profiles and fill out each cog with as many measurements as could reliably be made .",
    "the cog analysis , however , was generally limited to @xmath13 because the @xmath14 lines were saturated to the extent that they possessed broad damping wings that the equivalent width measurement algorithm could not reliably distinguish from the stellar continuum .",
    "thus , an iterative curve - fitting procedure was an additional requirement so that simultaneous determinations of galactic and magellanic cloud column densities for these lower h@xmath0 rotational excitation levels could be made .",
    "the complete molecular hydrogen models , including column densities for the available @xmath15 levels , the associated @xmath16-value , and the derived kinetic and excitation temperatures ( these last properties are discussed in section  [ ssection_h2 ] ) , are summarized in tables  [ mwmolhydtab ] and [ mcmolhydtab ] for all of our lmc and smc sight lines ; table  [ mwmolhydtab ] characterizes the galactic component for each sight line where one was detected , while table  [ mcmolhydtab ] details the properties of each magellanic cloud component .",
    "once molecular hydrogen absorption models had been constructed , each spectrum was corrected for this absorption .",
    "all of the _ fuse _ data for each star were combined into a single spectrum by shifting the calibrated channel spectra to a common wavelength reference and averaging the fluxes , weighted by the flux uncertainty at each point in the overlapping regions .",
    "although there are significant differences in the data dispersion properties for each channel , the merged spectrum for each star is of sufficient quality for the construction of a reliable extinction curve .",
    "the `` worm '' problem in _ fuse _ data @xcite was strong only in lif1b .",
    "its appearance in the data for this detector segment was identified by a comparison with the lif2a flux as the data for all detector segments were merged into a single spectrum for each sight line ; the portions of the lif1b spectrum contaminated by the worm were eliminated from the merging process .",
    "a running cross - correlation of the normalized h@xmath0 absorption profile corrected for any wavelength mismatches , and the full final model was divided into the merged _ fuse _ spectrum to complete the `` removal '' of the molecular hydrogen features .",
    "atomic hydrogen was not measured for each sight line individually , but its signature , specifically the ly@xmath12 and ly@xmath17 lines , was removed after the ratio of the reddened and comparison spectra was calculated as a function of wavelength . although _ fuse _ spectra cover wavelengths from 905 through 1187  , data shortward of 1044  ( our ly@xmath17 cutoff ) were not included in this analysis due to limitations in data quality .",
    "in the interest of consistency in instrument response , _ fuse _ flux levels were then manually rescaled to match _ iue _ fluxes over the wavelength range common to both instruments ( 1150 @xmath18 1185  ) when the full ir to fuv spectra were constructed ; given recent improvements to the calibration of _ iue _ data @xcite , flux errors associated with this instrument have not yet been surpassed by the latest _ fuse _ calibration @xcite .",
    "generally , mean fluxes for the data from each instrument agreed to within 20% , although there were a few targets for which the discrepancies exceeded this range .",
    "the scalings applied to each _ fuse _ spectrum ( the ratio of _ iue _ to _ fuse _ flux in the overlap region ) are given in table  [ fluxshifts ] .",
    "we have constructed extinction curves using the pair method ( e.g. , @xcite ) , normalized to @xmath19 through @xmath10 ; the pairs of reddened and unreddened stars in the lmc and smc were selected ( g03 ) and are listed in table  [ exttab ] . in an effort to minimize uncertainties in each extinction curve , particularly from spectral mismatch , a detailed comparison of the _ fuse _ spectrum for each star with similarly - typed unreddened candidates was performed , and the extinction pairs matched by g03 using _ iue _ were also found to be well - matched in the fuv .",
    "assembly of the extinction curve corresponding to each pair was accomplished using the same procedures and near - infrared through uv data outlined by g03 .",
    "we have also constructed average extinction curves for the subsets of the current sample associated with the lmcavg and lmc2 regions considered previously in the uv ( @xcite ; g03 ) .",
    "each of the individual lmc curves and the average curves have been fit to the @xcite parameterization ; the results are presented in table  [ fmtab ] .",
    "the two sight lines in the smc , one representing each of the bar and wing regions , are considered individually .",
    "a quick examination of the individual magellanic cloud extinction curves presented in figure  [ allcurves ] reveals that the _ fuse _ portion of each curve is generally consistent with an extension of the data from longer wavelengths .",
    "when the calibrated and h@xmath0-adjusted fluxes were initially compared , however , slight offsets were apparent between the portions of the curve on either side of the ly@xmath12 line . comparing the size of the gaps in the magellanic cloud data with the galactic curves studied in paper i led to the conclusion that the quality of the data for our reddened stars might have compromised the accuracy of the extinction curve construction .",
    "in particular , the s / n of the _ fuse _ data seemed to be inversely proportional to the size of the offset and there were noticeable flux level differences for some spectra between the _ iue _ and the merged _ fuse _ data in the spectral overlap region .",
    "the galactic sight lines had much better s / n values , negligible offsets , and good agreement between _ iue _ and _ fuse _ fluxes , whereas the magellanic cloud data suffered generally poor s / n , noticeable offsets , and sometimes poor flux agreement in the overlap . in order to reduce the offsets , the _ fuse _",
    "data for the cloud sight lines were linearly adjusted ( a wavelength - independent multiplicative factor was applied to the flux ) over the entire fuv bandpass so that their fluxes matched _ iue _ in the instruments overlap region .",
    "an example of one of the more egregious cases is plotted in figure  [ fluxmatch ] , including a comparison of the _ fuse _ flux levels both before and after adjustment to the _ iue _ flux level .",
    "the magnitude of each shift was estimated in increments of @xmath20 ; the systematic uncertainty associated with this adjustment has been propagated through all subsequent error calculations .",
    "typically , the shifts improved the appearance of the curves , although the offsets were not eliminated in all cases .",
    "given the general smoothness of the transition between uv and fuv portions of the extinction curve in most cases , it might seem reasonable to introduce further shifts to align these segments ; nevertheless , because the observed offsets fall generally within the error bounds , because we are interested in the detailed shape of the curve at uv and fuv wavelengths , and since we have no independent objective basis for such shifts , no further processing of the individual curves has been performed .",
    "it should also be noted that any residual offsets appear to be biased in the direction of decreased @xmath21 ; thus , abundance requirements derived from the fuv data may be slight underestimates .",
    "as already mentioned , a notable difficulty in deriving extinction curves that extend into the fuv is the existence of strong molecular hydrogen absorption bands longward of the ly@xmath12 line",
    ". nevertheless , stellar observations of sufficient quality to allow the h@xmath0 absorption to be modelled and removed not only permit the construction of an extinction curve but also provide more direct information on the intervening ism .",
    "recently , @xcite completed a survey of molecular hydrogen in the lmc and smc using several _ fuse _ observations of each cloud ; our sample introduces 15 new sight lines into the mix .    in considering these new molecular hydrogen measurements ,",
    "however , it should be recognized that the current _ fuse _ data generally have much lower signal - to - noise ratios than galactic observations .",
    "in fact , they are also somewhat lower than the values for previously - observed magellanic cloud targets .",
    "@xcite reported typical 4@xmath22 equivalent width limits of 3040 m , a level similar to values of 2050 m for our comparison stars but much lower than the 50120 m characteristic of the reddened targets .",
    "because of these data limitations , and because the goal of generating a reliable fuv continuum was given a somewhat higher priority than making a rigorous assessment of molecular hydrogen , any column densities smaller than about 10@xmath23 @xmath24 , and a few that are somewhat larger , are subject to sizable uncertainties .",
    "nevertheless , we consider the models listed in tables  [ mwmolhydtab ] and [ mcmolhydtab ] to be reasonable tallies of the h@xmath0 along each sight line .    in order to more",
    "fully understand how the new sight lines mesh with the @xcite magellanic cloud h@xmath0 analysis , we have adopted the atomic hydrogen measurements previously published by @xcite for the individual sight lines ( see table  [ hydtab ] ) ; for the pair listings in the table , we use the values derived directly from the extinction curves by g03 .",
    "it should be noted here that the process of determining atomic hydrogen column densities for the magellanic clouds is complicated by the large quantities detected along each sight line .",
    "the breadth of the ly@xmath12 absorption profile produced by typical interstellar hydrogen distributions with line - of - sight lengths exceeding even a few kiloparsecs is sufficient to mask distinctions between separate velocity components ; in particular , the profiles for atomic hydrogen gas in the lmc or smc are often inextricably blended with their galactic counterparts . @xcite",
    "dealt with this problem by calibrating 21 cm emission measurements to ly@xmath12 from the sight lines in their sample for which the galactic and magellanic cloud 1215  profiles were not severely blended .",
    "atomic hydrogen column densities for the remaining paths in the data set were then estimated using this calibration and the observed 21 cm emission .",
    "g03 assessed magellanic cloud column densities by measuring the ly@xmath12 profile in the reddened - to - comparison ratio spectrum for each extinction pair , under the assumption that the milky way components would cancel each other .",
    "each of these methods is subject to a significant level of uncertainty ; if vertical error bars were to be plotted in figure  [ f(h2)comp ] , among the magellanic cloud sight lines they might typically be about 0.3 dex and occasionally larger than 1.0 dex .",
    "nevertheless , differences between the @xcite values for the individual sight lines in each extinction pair generally are well matched by the corresponding column densities derived by g03 .",
    "considered individually , our lmc and smc sight lines and those studied by @xcite exhibit similar ranges in characteristics such as the molecular hydrogen fraction @xmath3(h@xmath0 ) ( @xmath25@xmath26 $ ] ) and the magellanic cloud portion of the color excess @xmath27 ; = @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is 0.075 and 0.037 for lmc and smc paths , respectively . ]",
    "values for the two lmc sight lines studied by @xcite also match these samples .",
    "since the current dataset was selected for its extinction properties , we can not speak to the overall frequency of molecular hydrogen detection in the clouds .",
    "however , as shown in figure  [ f(h2)comp ] , the @xmath3(h@xmath0)-values for paths along which we detect a cloud - based h@xmath0 component agree with the levels set by previously observed lmc and galactic sight lines of large @xmath1 .",
    "notably , the sight lines toward azv 456 and sk @xmath18672 possess larger molecular hydrogen fractions than any examined by @xcite ; meanwhile , among the paths directed toward our comparison stars we detect no magellanic h@xmath0 components .",
    "based on the previously - studied sight lines toward sk -6619 and sk -69270 , it was found that while the gas - to - dust ratio @xmath2()/@xmath27 is much larger in the clouds than typically seen in the milky way , the quantity @xmath2(h@xmath0)/@xmath27 has a similar value in each galaxy ( @xcite ; gunderson et al .",
    "this suggests a close relationship between dust and @xmath30 .",
    "similar behavior is evident for our new sight lines , since although the ratios @xmath2()/@xmath27 for these paths are roughly 410 times larger than the galactic mean , comparing h@xmath0 column densities with the same color excesses leads to a range of values around the galactic average . in this way",
    "our new sight lines complement the paths studied by gunderson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and the more heavily reddened paths of @xcite , implying generally lower values for @xmath3(h@xmath0 ) in the clouds ; nevertheless , the current dataset includes sight lines with unique properties .",
    "plotting the lmc @xmath2()/@xmath27 ratio as a function of @xmath31 ( see figure  [ gtdebvplot ] ) , there is a clear distinction between sk -672 and other reddened sight lines : this one lmc path is characterized by an `` atomic '' ratio appropriate to galactic curves , but because of its large molecular hydrogen column density the total gas - to - dust ratio approaches the values for other lmc sight lines . coupled with its milky way - like @xmath2 ( ) ratio",
    ", the agreement exhibited between the gas - to - dust ratios for sk -672 , the sight line with the largest @xmath3(h@xmath0)-value in our sample , and sight lines dominated by atomic gas reinforces the concept that the mechanisms governing dust formation in the galaxy and lmc are similar and that any differences in extinction arise out of how interstellar environmental conditions are manifested in dust grain population characteristics .",
    "the smc sight line azv 456 also possesses a `` galactic '' value for @xmath2()/@xmath27 that gives a @xmath32 ratio more closely resembling the values determined by @xcite for other smc paths .",
    "further details of the interstellar conditions , specifically the temperatures @xmath33 and @xmath34 , in the clouds can be derived from the relative rotational level populations of the individual sight lines ( table  [ mcmolhydtab ] ) .",
    "when the cloud density is sufficiently high and h@xmath0 column densities are large enough for the gas to become substantially molecular , ortho - para conversion will bring @xmath33 ( @xmath35 ) close to the kinetic temperature . except for the azv 462 sight line ,",
    "its value is fairly uniform among the lmc and smc components of our h@xmath0 models and we derive a weighted mean temperature of 50@xmath363 k. the magellanic cloud component of h@xmath0 toward azv 462 has the lowest column density among our extragalactic values , and the assumption that this value is consistent with the kinetic temperature breaks down .",
    "the mean temperature we have derived for the magellanic cloud components neglects azv 462 and is somewhat lower than the overall galactic mean of 77@xmath3617 k @xcite , but is consistent with both the value 55@xmath368 k derived from the galactic subsample for which @xmath37 @xcite and temperatures derived by @xcite for magellanic cloud gas along sight lines with some of the largest molecular column densities .",
    "it should be noted that the errors ascribed to each temperature listed in tables  [ mwmolhydtab ] and [ mcmolhydtab ] were derived from column density uncertainties , which were often large .",
    "thus , kinetic temperatures with uncertainties larger than about 60k should be regarded as less reliable . in particular , the formal uncertainty is listed in each case , even where it exceeds the calculated temperature , in order to indicate the relative reliability of each determination .",
    "we have also determined @xmath34 for each sight line from the slope in a plot of @xmath38 versus the excitation potential .",
    "is associated with values of t@xmath39 - \\log[n(j)/g_{j } ] } = \\frac{170 { \\rm k } \\times ( 2j - 1)}{\\ln[\\frac{2j+1}{2j-3 } \\frac{n(j-2)}{n(j)}]}\\;({\\rm for}\\ , j \\ge 2)$ ] , the temperature derived from comparing the populations of successive even or odd @xmath15 levels . ]",
    "this excitation temperature reflects the influence of fluorescent uv pumping and h@xmath0 formation in excited states on the molecular hydrogen rotational level population @xcite . like @xmath33 ,",
    "it is fairly uniform among the lmc and smc sight lines and we calculate a weighted mean of 244@xmath3633 k , similar to previously - determined values for magellanic cloud sight lines @xcite . comparing the column density ratios @xmath2(4)/@xmath2(2 ) and @xmath2(5)/@xmath2(3 ) for our sample with figure 11 from @xcite , we find that these sight lines are reasonably typical of their high @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) paths ; consequently , our measurements support their conclusions that the h@xmath0 formation rate in the clouds is low ( 1040% of galactic rates ) and that at least some regions are illuminated by relatively intense radiation fields ( 10100 times the galactic mean ) .",
    "we note , however , that the proportion of outliers in our sample that do not fit the range of galactic models calculated by @xcite is much smaller than theirs .",
    "values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 were also derived for the galactic components of our h@xmath0 models .",
    "a mean of @xmath33 = 67@xmath364 k was derived for the sight lines with larger column densities and more robust measurements , although higher , and likely to be in part non - thermal , temperatures are implied for several of the more diffuse paths .",
    "excitation temperatures for the galactic components ( 239@xmath3638 k ) are similar to those we have determined for the magellanic clouds .      before _ fuse _",
    ", only two reddened sight lines outside the galaxy had been studied in the fuv @xcite .",
    "both regional extinction groups in the lmc are represented by these two stars ; specifically , sk -6619 is associated with lmcavg and sk -69270 with lmc2 ( misselt et al .",
    "the uv extinction curves for these stars are typically non - ccm , but they share the trait of most galactic curves in that their uv extinction slope blends smoothly into the fuv .",
    "these two sight lines have been included for comparison in table  [ fmtab ] , which defines the lmc2 and lmcavg subsamples , although they were left out of the average extinction curves for those regions .",
    "@xcite published fuv extinction curves for 3 sight lines in each of the lmc and the smc using _ fuse _ data .",
    "unfortunately , the values of @xmath40(b - v ) for the reddened / unreddened star pairs chosen for that study are too small ( @xmath410.02 - 0.07 mag ) for detailed extinction studies . more specifically , these reddening values are comparable in size to the variation in the foreground @xmath1 and similar to the magnitude of the photometric uncertainties @xcite .",
    "so , within the uncertainties there is no significant reddening difference for any of the star pairs in @xcite , and those sight lines are not included in this study .    the new lmc and smc fuv extinction curves presented here seem to follow the trend of sk -69270 and sk -6619 .",
    "despite any small remaining offsets between the _ iue _ and _ fuse _ extinction curves ( see   [ ssection_h2modelling ] ) , the new fuv curves closely follow an extrapolation of their fm fits from the uv . out of our sample , only two curves exhibit significant deviations from this overall trend , azv 456 and sk -69228 .",
    "azv 456 is our lone reddened star situated in the smc wing , and the _ fuse _ portion of its extinction curve more closely resembles its fuv ccm curve than an extrapolation of its fm fit in the uv .",
    "coincidentally , the disagreement with the fm fit begins near the onset of molecular hydrogen absorption features ; however , attempting to reconcile the two portions of the _ fuse _ curve by adjusting the h@xmath0 column densities indicates that a single component for the clouds can not reproduce the observed continuum level shift , nor does it appear that a simple combination of overlapping components would accomplish this result .",
    "the effect does not appear to be related to a difference in the sensitivity of the various _ fuse _ channels either , since the continuum across this spectral region is contained in both the lif1b and lif2a detector bands .",
    "similar kinks are apparent to a much smaller degree in the galactic curves for hd 62542 , hd 73882 , and hd 210121 ( paper i ) ; nevertheless , those curves match the fm fits within the formal uncertainties [ approximately 14% in a(@xmath42)/a(v ) across the _ fuse _ band ] and we feel that it would not be appropriate to speculate further about the origin of these features until a larger data sample is compiled .",
    "the fuv extinction curve for sk -69228 is very noisy , which would usually indicate a poor match with its unreddened comparison star , but this same star is a good match through the uv .",
    "the problem seems to arise with a complex of photospheric lines evident in the comparison star spectrum , sk -6515 .",
    "an examination of intermediate continuum segments demonstrates that the reddened and comparison stellar spectra have very similar shapes aside from these lines , and that connecting the lower wavenumber portion of this star s fuv extinction curve with the two highest wavenumber points would be a reasonable approximation .",
    "notably , this procedure results in an fuv curve that is consistent with an extension of the uv fm fit , despite the impression that a small offset is still present after the _ fuse _ flux adjustment .",
    "the curve is still included in further analysis for the sake of completeness and because our comparison sample is limited , but we note that the mean curve derived for the lmc2 group , which includes this path , is consistent with the other curves in the group unaffected by any taint of mismatch . on the whole , the ease with which the uv and fuv extinction curves line up for our magellanic cloud sight lines complements the results for milky way sight lines ; namely , that most galactic sight lines also seem to show fuv extinction that is a good extrapolation of the fm fits made to the extinction curves in the uv . agreement between the ccm relation and fuv extinction ,",
    "however , has proved less ubiquitous .",
    "for instance , @xcite found that the fuv extinction for two galactic sight lines with large ( @xmath43 oph ) and small ( hd 25443 ) values of @xmath10 follow ccm closely , but that there are exceptions ; one notable example is the bright - nebula sight line toward hd 37903 which shows a steeper extinction in the fuv , based on _ copernicus _ data , than would be predicted by ccm .",
    "paper i , which included paths such as hd 210121 and hd 62542 that do not follow ccm in the uv , came to similar conclusions . although the uv extinction curves for each sight line they studied could be smoothly extrapolated into the fuv using an fm fit , only three paths that followed ccm through uv wavelengths were also in accord across the fuv .",
    "the ccm relations for four others from paper i either over or underestimated their fuv extinction , as small discrepancies in the uv became more pronounced at shorter wavelengths , and the two non - ccm curves diverged more strongly from their @xmath10-based curves with increasing wavenumber . because the lmc and smc curves do not have a ccm - like wavelength dependence and because the s / n ratios of the individual extinction curves are relatively low , subtle variations in the fuv slope such as those seen by @xcite can not be ruled out .      to increase the s / n for mem modelling purposes , we have constructed average extinction curves for the lmc average and lmc2 regions outlined by misselt et al .",
    "1999 ( see table  [ fmtab ] ) ; the curves are plotted in figure  [ extcurves ] .",
    "the two sight lines in the smc , which represent the bar and wing regions , are considered individually . using the two average lmc curves and the two smc curves , we have extended the dust - grain population analysis of @xcite into the fuv .",
    "we employ a ( slightly ) modified version of the mem extinction - fitting algorithm @xcite . instead of using the number of grains of a given size to describe the dust population , the algorithm employs the mass distribution in which @xmath44 is the mass of dust grains per h atom in the size interval from @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "thus , the traditional mrn - type model @xcite becomes @xmath47 .",
    "we use a power law with exponential decay ( ped ) as the template function for each component .",
    "the data are examined at 34 wavelengths , and the grain cross sections are computed over the range 0.00252.7 with 50 logarithmically spaced bins .",
    "the shape of the mass distribution is strongly constrained only for data over the interval 0.021 .",
    "below 0.02 , the rayleigh scattering behavior constrains only total mass ; above 1 , the `` grey '' nature of the dust opacity also forces the mem algorithm to simply adjust the total mass , using the shape of the template function to specify the size dependence of the distribution .",
    "the total mass of dust is constrained using both the gas - to - dust ratio and `` cosmic '' abundances ( i.e. , we try not to use more carbon or silicon than is available ) .",
    "the elemental abundance standards used in this analysis are those adopted in paper i for the galaxy ( 358 and 35 atoms per million h for c and si , respectively ) , and by @xcite for the lmc and smc ( 110 and 65 for the lmc and 54 and 11 atoms per million h for the smc ) ; table  [ hydtab ] reports the values of the gas - to - dust ratios used here for the lmc and smc .",
    "we consider only three - component models of homogeneous , spherical grains : modified `` astronomical silicate '' @xcite , amorphous carbon @xcite , and graphite @xcite .",
    "while it must be acknowledged that the three grain component system we have used to model these extinction curves is simpler than might be expected of actual interstellar dust , the results can be quite useful for identifying grain population properties that distinguish sight lines from one another .",
    "the same component - specific ped constraints ( e.g. , the onset of the exponential cutoff ) adopted in paper i were utilized for the current modelling .",
    "the mem fits to fm parameterizations of the average magellanic cloud extinction curves listed in table  [ fmtab ] are presented in figures  [ memfits ] and [ memmass ] .",
    "the first plot shows the amount of extinction provided by the three distinct grain components , as well as the total extinction of the model , compared to the fm fit associated with each extinction curve .",
    "the error bars plotted on these fits are indicative of the mean gap between the fm fit and the underlying extinction curve in each wavelength bin .",
    "the fractions of the adopted elemental abundances available for each grain component that are required by the best mem fit are listed in table  [ memtab ] .",
    "figure  [ memmass ] depicts the corresponding mass distributions for different sizes of grains belonging to each model component relative to the mass of hydrogen .",
    "the proportions of the available silicon and carbon used in the mem fits to the various fm parameterizations cover a very wide range , as was seen in fits to ir through uv data alone by @xcite .",
    "three general factors determine the fraction of silicon and carbon that any individual sight line will use .",
    "first , the higher the gas - to - dust ratio is , the more metals are available in the gas phase .",
    "second , the higher the abundances of metals are , the more material is available .",
    "finally , high values of @xmath10 imply a greater than average mass fraction in larger grains which are not as efficient per unit mass as smaller grains . for instance",
    ", it can be seen from the mem fits that the smc wing ( azv 456 ) , which has a low gas - to - dust ratio and low elemental abundances relative to the galaxy , uses more than 100% of the available silicon .",
    "however , the lmc2 and the smc bar ( azv 18 ) regions , which also have both low elemental abundances but are characterized by higher gas - to - dust ratios , use less than half the amount of available silicon that the lmcavg and smc wing regions require and also significantly less carbon .    a recent observation has suggested that silicon is relatively undepleted in the smc bar @xcite .",
    "however , model fits to the average smc bar extinction indicate that its curve can not be fitted with carbon grains alone @xcite .",
    "figures  [ memfits ] and [ memmass ] clearly show that this conclusion is born out in the current fits .",
    "smc extinction for both bar and wing is very steep in the fuv , necessitating the presence of a large population of small grains . yet because the 2175  bump is absent in the bar region , small ( @xmath48 ) carbon grains do not meet the smc fuv extinction requirements ; thus , silicates play a very important role in the models .",
    "even our smc wing sight line , whose extinction curve follows ccm reasonably well , places a much higher demand on silicon reserves than carbon : a typical galactic curve conforming to ccm allows graphite to fulfill a significant part in fuv extinction due to the strength of its uv bump , but the smc wing bump is somewhat weaker than the @xmath10=2.19 ccm curve would imply .",
    "the next steepest sight lines , in the lmc , do not show much difference in demand from a typical galactic curve ( hd 14250 was chosen from paper i for illustration purposes ) , once the gas - to - dust ratio differences are taken into account .",
    "typically , carbon grains are responsible for most of the visible extinction and silicon grains for most of the uv extinction ; therefore , in general , both species of grains are needed along any sight line to get a good fit to the extinction curve .",
    "apart from deficits of large silicate and carbon grains in the smc , the mem analysis of the magellanic cloud fuv extinction produces results similar to those derived from an analysis of several galactic sight lines ( paper i ) .",
    "the galactic sight lines , like the smc wing or lmcavg , are more likely to use more than 100% of the available silicon and/or carbon . among these sight lines ,",
    "the strength of the 2175  bump in relation to the fuv rise is the factor that distinguishes whether the stiffer abundance demand is placed on silicon or carbon .",
    "likewise , the element most demanded by the smc bar sight line and the mean lmc2 curve is determined by this factor , although the minimal presence of the bump in these curves allows the modelling to make more efficient use ( especially in small grains ) of the available elements .    the general structure in the size vs @xmath49 curves for extinction out to 8 @xmath9 for the magellanic cloud sight lines does not change much when the _ fuse _ data are included .",
    "figures  [ memfits ] and [ memmass ] showing the mem fits and size vs @xmath49 curves can not be directly compared to figure 3 of @xcite because there are differences in the input parameters such as the gas - to - dust ratios .",
    "but the mem models run with the same input parameters for extinction curve that are cutoff at 8 @xmath9 and those shown here , which extend to 10 @xmath9 , are quite similar ; there is at most a few percent difference in the amount of silicon and carbon required by the two sets of models for the four smc and lmc curves .",
    "the structure evident in the mass distributions of figure  [ memmass ] particularly identify grain sizes for which each component in our simple model can account for the detailed shape of each extinction curve .",
    "for instance , the two peaks in the amorphous carbon distribution for hd 14250 correspond roughly to maxima appearing in the silicate distribution of @xcite in their silicate - graphite model .",
    "these authors ascribe the peaks to the requirements of fitting the optical and uv portions of the extinction curve using the spectral wavelength dependence appropriate to each of the two grain components in their model . in the case of azv 456 ( the smc wing ) , however , efforts to reproduce the extinction curve using this three - component model appear to require dramatic peaks and dips in the mass distribution as a function of grain size . aside from this curve , however , the scale of structure in the distribution is consistent with levels noted by previous studies ( kim et al .",
    "1994 ; @xcite ) . for azv 456",
    ", the solution requires that the graphite distribution be strongly peaked in order to account for the 2175  bump and provide as much extinction as possible at fuv wavelengths .",
    "since the fuv portion of this curve extends , or even amplifies , the steep rise at the short - wavelength end of the previous ir through uv result @xcite , there is no relaxation of the demand on silicon reserves . specifically , when comparing mem solutions for the smc wing curve with and without the _ fuse _ data , nearly identical proportions of the available silicon and carbon are utilized .",
    "the only notable distinction between the two solutions is that a few percent of the amorphous carbon demand is shifted to graphite when the fuv data are included .",
    "the extinction curves for our other groups also smoothly extend from the uv into fuv wavelengths , and the models derived from ir - to - uv and ir - to - fuv data require almost precisely the same amounts of silicon and carbon be present in dust grains .",
    "the similarity in the mem results for these two sets of models may be due to the efficiency of the small grains in fuv extinction , in that large numbers of such grains are not needed , or perhaps the observed amounts of fuv extinction can be provided by the larger grains which are also important for extinction at longer wavelengths .",
    "this issue will be investigated further as we study the distinction between global and sight - line - specific fuv extinction characteristics of using a much larger number of sight lines , in a future paper .",
    "this paper is the second in a series investigating the fuv characteristics of extinction due to interstellar dust .",
    "the first paper dealt with a small sample of galactic sight lines with a variety of @xmath10 values , including paths whose extinction does not conform to the ccm parameterization .",
    "this paper examined a similarly - sized set of sight lines probing the small and large magellanic clouds , with the goal of determining how the addition of fuv data to their corresponding extinction curves affected models of magellanic cloud dust grain properties .    using _ fuse _ observations of four stars in the smc and 12 stars in the lmc",
    ", we were able to construct two extinction curves for the smc and seven representing the lmc . despite the poor quality of the data for some of the reddened stars ,",
    "molecular hydrogen was measured for each sight line and their corresponding absorption features were removed from consideration in the extinction analysis .",
    "flux mismatches between _ iue _ and _ fuse _ data , likely due to poor s / n values in the affected observations , were alleviated by rescaling the entire _ fuse _ spectrum .",
    "comparison of the resulting fuv extinction with the curve constructed only through wavelengths observed by _",
    "iue _ demonstrated that the fuv portions were generally consistent with a smooth extrapolation of the ir - to - uv curve .",
    "nevertheless , we note that a `` kink '' appeared in the azv 456 curve , similar to much smaller features present in curves analysed in paper i. we plan to address the existence and nature of this kink in a subsequent paper examining the variation in properties of fuv extinction .",
    "it was anticipated that including fuv data in the mem analysis of the magellanic cloud dust grain population might give rise to significantly different properties than galactic dust since the fuv rise in the clouds is generally much steeper than it is in the milky way , and the uv bump is smaller .",
    "however , aside from some complex structure likely driven by the simplicity of our grain component model , the sight lines through the clouds exhibitting galactic - like extinction are similar to galactic paths in that they demand 100% or more of the available carbon and/or silicon .",
    "the only real differences between the populations for these galaxies are that the smc wing sight line has a much smaller grain size cutoff for astronomical silicates and amorphous carbon and a generally smaller dust mass .",
    "mem solutions for the sight lines through the clouds that exhibited more distinctly magellanic - cloud - type extinction were able to satisfy their curves using smaller proportions of the elements available to them ; the smc bar solution , like that for the smc wing , is characterized by a smaller grain size cutoff and lower dust mass than galactic or lmc solutions .",
    "the addition of the _ fuse _ data to the analysis does not dramatically alter the properties of each dust population , except to shift small amounts of the carbon demand between amorphous carbon and graphite .",
    "the molecular hydrogen abundances determined in the process of constructing the full ir - to - fuv extinction curves supplement those already appearing in the literature .",
    "although the emphasis has been on eliminating h@xmath0 absorption features from the spectra rather than deriving robust column density measurements , our results are consistent with the larger recent survey of molecular hydrogen in the magellanic clouds by @xcite and we complement their paths by probing several sight lines with larger column densities . among these sight lines , @xmath1/@xmath2 ( ) ratios",
    "are generally reduced relative to galactic values while @xmath1/@xmath2(h@xmath0 ) are roughly the same , implying somewhat lower @xmath3(h@xmath0)-values in the clouds than are typical in the milky way for similar degrees of reddening .",

    "<S> we present an extinction analysis of nine reddened / comparison star pairs in the large and small magellanic clouds based on _ far - ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _ fuv observations . to date , just two lmc sight lines have probed dust grain composition and size distributions in the magellanic clouds using spectral data for wavelengths as short as 950  . </S>",
    "<S> we supplement these two with data from 4 regions distinguished by their ir through uv extinction curves and grouped as lmcavg , lmc2 , smc bar and smc wing . despite the distinct characters of extinction in the clouds and milky way , our results are generally analogous to those found for galactic curves  </S>",
    "<S> namely , that the _ fuse _ portions of each extinction curve are described reasonably well by fitzpatrick & massa curves fitted only to longer wavelength data and lack any dramatic new extinction features , and any deviations from the cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( ccm ) formalism continue into fuv wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> a maximum entropy method analysis of all of these curves suggests that lmcavg and smc wing sight lines , whose extinction parameters more closely resemble those for galactic paths , require more silicon and/or carbon in dust than current abundance measurements would indicate are available . </S>",
    "<S> the requirements for lmc2 and smc bar sight lines do not fully tax the available reservoirs , in part because large grains contribute less to the extinction in these directions . </S>",
    "<S> an intermediate product of this extinction analysis is the measurement of new h@xmath0 abundances in the magellanic clouds . collectively considering cloud sight lines that possess significant h@xmath0 column densities , @xmath1/@xmath2 ( ) ratios </S>",
    "<S> are reduced by significant factors relative to the galactic mean , whereas the corresponding @xmath1/@xmath2(h@xmath0 ) values more closely resemble their galactic counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> these trends reflect the fact that among these sight lines @xmath3(h@xmath0)-values are lower than those common in the milky way for paths with similar degrees of reddening . </S>"
