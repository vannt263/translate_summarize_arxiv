    "at the nano - scale , steps play a crucial role in the dynamics of surfaces . understanding step behavior is therefore essential before nano - structures can be self - assembled and controlled . in turn",
    ", step stiffness plays a central role in our understanding of how steps respond to fluctuations and driving forces .",
    "it is one of the three parameters of the step - continuum model,@xcite which has proved a powerful way to describe step behavior on a coarse - grained level , without recourse to a myriad of microscopic energies and rates . as the inertial term",
    ", stiffness determines how a step responds to interactions with other steps , to atomistic mass - transport processes , and to external driving forces .",
    "accordingly , a thorough understanding of stiffness and its consequences is crucial .",
    "the step stiffness @xmath0 weights deviations from straightness in the step hamiltonian .",
    "thus , it varies inversely with the step diffusivity , which measures the degree of wandering of a step perpendicular to its mean direction .",
    "this diffusivity can be readily written down in terms of the energies @xmath1 of kinks along steps with a mean orientation along close - packed directions ( @xmath2 for an fcc ( 001 ) surface ) : in this case , all kinks are thermally excited .",
    "conversely , experimental measurements of the low - temperature diffusivity ( via the scale factor of the spatial correlation function ) can be used to deduce the kink energy .",
    "a more subtle question is how this stiffness depends on the azimuthal misorientation angle , conventionally called @xmath3 and measured from the close - packed direction .",
    "in contrast to @xmath4 steps , even for temperatures much below @xmath1 , there are always a non - vanishing number of kinks , the density of which are fixed by geometry ( and so are proportional to @xmath5 ) . in a bond - counting model , the energetic portion of the step free energy per length ( or , equivalently , the line tension , since the surface is maintained at constant [ zero ] charge@xcite ) @xmath6 is cancelled by its second derivative with respect to @xmath3 , so that the stiffness is due to the entropy contribution alone .",
    "away from close - packed directions , this entropy can be determined by simple combinatoric factors at low temperature @xmath7.@xcite    interest in this whole issue has been piqued by the recent finding by dieluweit _",
    "_ @xcite that the stiffness as predicted in the above fashion , assuming that only nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interactions @xmath8 are important , underestimates the values for cu(001 ) derived from two independent types of experiments : direct measurement of the diffusivity on vicinal cu surfaces with various tilts and examination of the shape of ( single - layer ) islands .",
    "the agreement of the two types of measurements assures that the underestimate is not an anomaly due to step - step interactions . in that work , the effect of next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) interactions @xmath9 was crudely estimated by examining a general formula obtained by akutsu and akutsu,@xcite showing a correction of order @xmath10 , which was glibly deemed to be insignificant . in subsequent work",
    "the twente group @xcite considered steps in just the two principal directions and showed that if one included an attractive nnn interaction , one could evaluate the step free energies and obtain a ratio consistent with the experimental results in ref . .",
    "this group later extended their calculations@xcite to examine the stiffness .    to make contact with experiment",
    ", one typically first gauges the diffusivity along a close - packed direction and from it extracts the ratio of the elementary kink energy @xmath1 to @xmath7 .",
    "arguably the least ambiguous way to relate @xmath1 to bonds in a lattice gas model is to extract an atom from the edge and place it alongside the step well away from the new unit indentation , thereby creating four kinks.@xcite the removal of the step atom costs energy @xmath11 while its replacement next to the step recoups @xmath12 .",
    "thus , whether or not there are nnn interactions , we identify @xmath13 ( since the formation of cu islands implies @xmath14 ) ; thus , as necessary , @xmath15 .",
    "note that for clarity we reserve the character @xmath16 for lattice - gas energies,@xcite which are deduced by fitting this model to energies which can be measured , such as @xmath1 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to compute the step line tension @xmath17 and the stiffness @xmath0 as functions of azimuthal misorientation @xmath3 , when nnn ( in addition to nn ) interactions contribute .",
    "since it is difficult to generalize the low - temperature expansion of the ising model,@xcite we instead study the sos ( solid - on - solid ) model , which behaves very similarly at low temperatures and at azimuthal misorientations that are not too large , but can be analyzed exactly even with nnn interactions .",
    "this derivation is described in section ii , with most of the calculational details placed in the appendix . in section iii we derive a simple expression for the stiffness in the low - temperature limit , presented in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nnnstiffness ] ) .",
    "we also make contact with parameters relevant to cu(001 ) , for which this limit is appropriate . in section",
    "iv we extend the formalism to encompass the presumably - strongest trio ( 3-atom , non - pairwise ) interaction , showing that its effect can be taken into account by shifting the pair energies in the preceding work .",
    "the final section offers discussion and conclusions .",
    "including nnn interactions in the low - temperature expansion of the square - lattice ising model lifts the remarkable degeneracy of the model with just nn bonds . in that simple case",
    ", the energy of a path depends solely on the number of nn links , independent of the arrangement of kinks along it ; thus , the energy of the ground state is proportional to the number of nn links of the shortest path between two points , and the entropy is related to the number of combinations of horizontal and vertical links that can connect the points.@xcite including nnn interactions causes the step energy to become a function of both the length of the step and the number of its kinks , eliminating the simple path - counting result.@xcite it can then become energetically favorable for the step to lengthen rather than add another kink .",
    "this causes the nn energy levels to split in a non - trivial way , making it possible for a longer step to have a lower energy than a shorter step .",
    "a related complication is that the expansion itself depends on the relative strength of the nnn - interaction : instead of an expansion just in terms of @xmath18 , the expansion also is in terms of @xmath19 .",
    "hence , to take the nnn - expansion to the same order of magnitude as the nn - expansion , an unspecified number of terms is required , depending on the size of the ratio @xmath20 .    since the nnn ising model can not be solved exactly and we can not generalize the low-@xmath7 expansion , we turn to an sos model , which was used in earlier examinations of step problems , most notably in the seminal work of burton , cabrera , and frank,@xcite and later used for steps of arbitrary orientation by leamy , gilmer , and jackson.@xcite it was also applied to an interface of arbitrary orientation in a square - lattice ising model.@xcite    although the sos model can be treated exactly , the result is somewhat unwieldy .",
    "fortunately , at low temperature  the appropriate regime for the experiments under consideration  the solution reduces to a simple expression .",
    "consider a step edge of projected length @xmath21 separating an upper adatom - free region from a lower adatom - filled region ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nnnbonds ] ) .    .",
    "the step has height @xmath22 at position @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the height difference @xmath25 is fixed ; thus , the step edge makes an angle @xmath3 with the horizontal axis , and has an overall slope @xmath26 ( shown as the top of the gray region ) .",
    "the energy of the step edge is found by counting the number of broken links required to form it . here",
    "all nn and nnn broken links are shown . ,",
    "width=8 ]    [ fig : nnnbonds ]    the step edge is completely described by specifying its height @xmath22 at position @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the energy of the step edge depends on the number of broken bonds required to form it .",
    "let @xmath27 and @xmath28 represent the vertical and horizontal nn bond strengths divided by @xmath29 , and let @xmath30 and @xmath31 represent up - diagonal and down - diagonal nnn bond strengths over @xmath29 .",
    "then the step - edge energy @xmath32 depends only on @xmath33 .    for clarity ,",
    "we consider two examples .",
    "first , if @xmath34 ( as is the case between columns a and b in fig .",
    "[ fig : nnnbonds ] ) , then between positions @xmath23 and @xmath35 there are @xmath36 broken @xmath28-links , @xmath37 broken @xmath30-links , and @xmath38 broken @xmath31-links .",
    "there are also @xmath37 broken @xmath27-links , but this number is independent of @xmath39 , since every step - edge configuration of projected length @xmath21 requires exactly @xmath21 broken @xmath27-links .",
    "similarly , if @xmath40 ( as is the case between columns c and d in fig .",
    "[ fig : nnnbonds ] ) , then there would be the same number of broken @xmath28-links , but there would now be @xmath38 broken @xmath30-links and @xmath37 broken @xmath31-links ( that is , the number of broken @xmath30 and @xmath31 links switch from the previous case ) . from these examples",
    "we see that , in general , there are @xmath41 broken @xmath28-links , @xmath42 broken @xmath30-links , and @xmath43 broken @xmath31-links .",
    "it therefore follows that the step - edge energy is @xmath44    because we seek the orientation dependence of @xmath17 and @xmath0 , we constrain the step to have an overall offset @xmath45 .",

    "this leads to the formation of two complementary irregular boundary layers ( with opposite values of @xmath71 , so that the associated energy of each is half that of the broken bonds ( at least when @xmath69 ) .",
