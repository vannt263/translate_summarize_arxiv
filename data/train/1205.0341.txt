    "the transition from single - particle to many - body quantum systems yields one of the most interesting concepts of physics : _ emergence_. as emphasized by p. w. anderson  @xcite , the laws that describe the collective behavior of interacting many - body systems can be fundamentally different from those that govern each of the individual particles .",
    "this effect leads to some of the most exotic phenomena of condensed - matter physics in the last decades  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the high complexity of many - body systems turns our endeavor to understand such emergent phenomena into a fundamental challenge for both experimental and theoretical physics .",
    "since exact analytical solutions seldom exist , even for oversimplified models , one is urged to develop efficient numerical methods .",
    "an alternative to this approach are the so - called _ quantum simulations _",
    "@xcite , which make use of a particular quantum system that can be experimentally controlled to a high extent , in order to unveil the properties of a complicated interacting many - body model .",
    "there are two different strategies for the quantum simulation of many - body systems  @xcite , the so - called analog and digital quantum simulators ( qss ) . on the one hand , an ideal analog",
    "qs would be a dedicated experimental device where one can prepare the quantum state , engineer a hamiltonian of interest , and measure its properties .",
    "on the other hand , a digital qs aims at reproducing the dynamics of any given hamiltonian by concatenating a set of available quantum gates .",
    "independently of their particular experimental implementation , these types of qss would be capable of exploring models from very different areas of physics , ranging from condensed - matter to high - energy physics .",
    "let us remark that this enterprise benefits directly from the development of architectures for quantum - information processing  @xcite .",
    "in this work , we focus on one of these architectures : laser - cooled atomic ions confined in radio - frequency traps  @xcite . here , some remarkable quantum simulations have already been accomplished in experiments , either in the digital  @xcite or analog  @xcite versions . in particular ,",
    "we shall concentrate on analog qss , where a number of theoretical proposals already exist  @xcite . some of these proposals target the quantum simulation of relativistic effects  @xcite , quantum spin models  @xcite , many - body boson systems  @xcite , spin - boson models  @xcite , or theories of quantum transport and friction  @xcite .",
    "a direction of research that is being actively explored is the qs of _ magnetism _",
    "@xcite , which yields a playground for a variety of cooperative quantum many - body effects . even though the phenomenon of magnetic ordering was already known to the ancient greeks , the understanding of its microscopic origin could only be achieved after the development of quantum mechanics .",
    "a particular topic of recurring interest is the fate of the magnetically - ordered phases in the presence of quantum fluctuations  @xcite , which get more pronounced as the dimensionality of the system is reduced .",
    "such quantum fluctuations may destroy the long - range order , favoring paramagnetic phases and triggering the so - called _ quantum phase transitions _",
    "alternatively , they may stabilize more interesting phases , such as the long - sought two - dimensional _ quantum spin liquids _ , which have connections with the theory of high - temperature superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "the advent of a qs for quantum magnetism would allow for an unprecedented experimental realization of these phases , addressing puzzles that remain unsolved due to their great complexity .    a representative model that exemplifies the usefulness of analog qs is the one - dimensional quantum ising model  @xcite , which describes a chain of interacting spins subjected to a transverse magnetic field .",
    "this model has traditionally been considered as a cornerstone in the theory of quantum phase transitions  @xcite . however , the vast majority of low - dimensional materials realize instances of the so - called heisenberg model ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the demanding requirements to explore the ising magnetism in real materials ( e.g. precise one - dimensionality , strong ising anisotropy , and weak exchange couplings matching the available magnetic fields ) have postponed its observation until the recent experiments with conb@xmath0o@xmath1  @xcite . we stress that prior to this experiment , trapped - ion qss had already targeted the onset of ising criticality  @xcite .",
    "more recently , ising interactions in a large collection of ions have been observed in penning traps  @xcite , which in combination with the recent results for neutral atoms  @xcite , yield the unique possibility of tailoring the microscopic properties of the quantum ising magnet ( e.g. couplings , dimensionality , geometry ) .    in this manuscript",
    ", we investigate the capabilities of trapped ions as qss of frustrated quantum ising models ( fqims ) .",
    "here , frustration arises from the impossibility of minimizing simultaneously a set of competing commuting interactions ( i.e. classical frustration )  @xcite , whereas the quantum fluctuations are introduced by a transverse magnetic field .",
    "we remark that , with the exceptions of three - dimensional spin ice  @xcite and some disordered spin - glass compounds  @xcite , most of the frustrated materials correspond once more to heisenberg magnets  @xcite .",
    "this would turn the extensive research on low - dimensional frustrated ising models  @xcite into a pure theoretical enterprise .",
    "fortunately , the seminal experiment  @xcite has proved the contrary by demonstrating that the physics of small frustrated networks  @xcite can be explored in trapped - ion laboratories . in a recent work  @xcite , we have studied a different approach to control the degree of frustration in ion crystals , which works independently of the number of ions and is thus amenable of being scaled to large systems . in this manuscript",
    ", we elaborate on that proposal to develop a versatile quantum simulator for a variety of spin ladder geometries .",
    "a _ quantum spin ladder _ is an array of coupled quantum spin chains .",
    "each of these spin chains is usually known as a leg of the ladder , whereas the couplings between them define the ladder rungs .",
    "let us note that the study of antiferromagnetic heisenberg ladders has a long tradition inspired by the experiments with insulating cuprate compounds  @xcite , which become high - temperature superconductors after doping  @xcite .",
    "these strongly - correlated systems lead to fascinating and thoroughly - studied phenomena  @xcite . in contrast , the _ quantum ising ladders _ have remained largely unexplored , probably due to the absence of materials that realize them .",
    "our work discusses a proposal to fill in such gap , which is based on techniques of current trapped - ion experiments .",

    "we describe conditions under which they do not affect the proposed qs .",
    "an ensemble of @xmath4 atomic ions of mass @xmath5 , and charge @xmath6 , can be trapped in a microscopic region of space by means of radio - frequency fields  @xcite .",
    "this system is described by @xmath7 where @xmath8 represent the effective trapping frequencies ( see also sec .  [ experimental ] and appendix  [ appendix_micromotion ] ) , and @xmath9 are the positions and momenta of the ions .",
    "note that we use gaussian units and @xmath10 throughout this text .    with the advent of laser cooling ,",
    "it has become possible to reduce the temperature of the ions to such an extent that they crystallize .",
    "this gives rise to one of the forms of condensed matter with the lowest attained density , ranging from clusters composed by two ions  @xcite , to crystals of several thousands  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , these crystals can be assembled sequentially by increasing the number of trapped ions one by one , so that the aforementioned transition to the many - body regime  @xcite can be studied in the laboratory . besides , the geometry of the crystals can be controlled experimentally by tuning the anisotropy of the trapping frequencies  @xcite , which opens a vast amount of possibilities for the qs of magnetism .",

    "formally , they are given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 contains the trapping and coulomb potentials . by introducing the unit of length @xmath23 , the dimensionless equilibrium positions @xmath24",
    "follow from the solution of the system @xmath25 where we have introduced the anisotropy parameters @xmath26 .",
    "as shown in the experiments  @xcite , by increasing the parameters @xmath27 towards a maximum value @xmath28 , the geometry of the ion crystal undergoes a series of phase transitions starting from a linear chain , via a two - dimensional zigzag ladder , to a three - dimensional helix .",
    "we remark that these structural phase transitions have been the subject of considerable interest on their own  @xcite .",
    "we have recently investigated the possibility of setting a large anisotropy between the radial trap frequencies @xmath29 , such that the ion crystals get pinned to the @xmath30-plane  @xcite .",
    "this requires a modification of the symmetric electrode configuration of the usual linear traps ( see the details in sec .",
    "[ experimental ] ) . besides",
    ", the parameter @xmath31 can be increased by a bias voltage , yielding a variety of geometries .",
    "for instance , above a certain value @xmath32 , the linear chain transforms onto a @xmath33-leg ladder ( see figs .",
    "[ ladder_geometries]*(a)-(b ) * ) . by solving numerically the system of equations  ,",
    "we observe that the 2-leg zigzag ladder first evolves into a 3-leg ladder as @xmath31 is increased , then yields a 4-leg ladder [ see figs .  [ ladder_geometries]*(c ) * and  [ ladder_geometries]*(f ) * ] , and so on .",
    "hence , there should be a sequence of structural transitions at the critical values @xmath34 , where @xmath35 determines the number of legs of the trapped - ion ladders .",
    "the rungs of these ladders correspond to the diagonal links , yielding a collection of bond - sharing triangular plaquettes . in sec .",
    "[ experimental ] , we describe a method to build ladders from corner - sharing triangles ( see figs .",
    "[ ladder_geometries]*(d)-(e ) * ) , which widens the applicability of our qs .    eventually , when @xmath36 , the crystal must correspond to a two - dimensional bond - sharing triangular lattice , or corner - sharing kagome lattice , with ellipsoidal boundaries .",
    "accordingly , not only can we control the number of legs of the trapped - ion ladder , but also explore the crossover from quasi - one - dimensional physics to the two - dimensional realm .",
    "with respect to the fqims , this two - dimensional limit is very appealing due to its connection to quantum spin liquids  @xcite , and quantum dimer models  @xcite .",
    "however , as happens for heisenberg magnets  @xcite , the ladder compounds may already contain fascinating phenomenology .",
    "let us remark that the precise knowledge of the crystal plane is a fundamental advantage for the quantum simulation of fqim  @xcite .",
    "prior to the discussion of the effective fqim , we will describe the collective vibrational modes in these ladder compounds , since they shall act as mediators of the magnetic ising - type interaction .    at this point",
    ", it is worth commenting on the possibility of engineering the lattice positions of the ion crystal by means of micro - fabricated electrode arrangements , ( e.g. surface traps as proposed in  @xcite ) .",
    "if the technical problems related to the anomalous heating observed close to the electrodes are overcome , these new generation of traps could be combined with the proposed qs to study frustrated spin models in arbitrary lattices without the complication of micromotion . however , to keep within reach of the current technology , we focus on the more standard paul traps where experiments on quantum magnetism have already been performed  @xcite .      due to the coulomb interaction , the vibrations of the ions around the equilibrium positions , @xmath37 , become coupled . by expanding the hamiltonian   to second order in the displacements @xmath38 , one obtains a model of coupled harmonic oscillators corresponding to the harmonic approximation @xmath39 in this expression , the coupling matrix between the harmonic oscillators can be expressed in terms of the mutual ion distance @xmath40 , and the quadrupole moment for each pair of ions @xmath41 $ ] as follows @xmath42 for the particular ladder geometries in fig .",
    "[ ladder_geometries ] , we identify two types of vibrational excitations , the so - called _ transverse modes _ that correspond to the vibrations of the ions perpendicular to the ladder ( i.e. @xmath43-axis ) , and the _ planar _ modes that account for the coupled vibrations within the ladder ( i.e. @xmath44 axes ) .",
    "the transverse modes are decoupled from the planar vibrations , and are described by a set of coupled oscillators @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "this term amounts to the einstein model of individual lattice vibrations , where the renormalization of the frequencies is caused by the mean - field - type interaction of one ion with the rest of the ion ensemble . in our case",
    ", we must also consider the coupling between distant oscillators , whose magnitude relative to the trapping frequencies scales as @xmath47 .",
    "hence , the transverse vibrations are described by a set of harmonic oscillators with weak couplings that decay with a dipolar law .",
    "the planar vibrations are more complex since the motion along both axes , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , becomes coupled through the coulomb interaction . in this case ,",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath50 where @xmath51 ( equivalently for @xmath49 ) , and @xmath52 is expressed in terms of the dimensionless equilibrium positions . since we have assumed that @xmath53 , the planar vibrations are coupled more strongly than the transverse ones . in the last term of this eq .",
    ", we observe how the non - diagonal terms of the quadrupole , @xmath54 , are responsible for the coupling of the motion along the @xmath48 and @xmath49 axes of the ladder .",
    "so far , we have reduced the original hamiltonian   to a pair of quadratic boson models  - .",
    "these can be exactly solved by introducing the canonical transformations @xmath55 where @xmath56 stand for the @xmath4 creation - annihilation operators for the quantized excitations ( i.e. phonons ) of the transverse modes , and @xmath57 are the the corresponding @xmath58 operators for the planar modes . in these expressions ,",
    "@xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) determines the amplitude of the transverse ( planar ) oscillations of the ion at site @xmath61 due to the collective vibrational mode labeled by @xmath62 , such that @xmath63 are the corresponding normal - mode frequencies .",
    "formally  @xcite , @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) are given by the orthogonal matrices that diagonalize the second order coulomb couplings in eqs .  - , or equivalently @xmath64 where @xmath65 are dimensionless couplings .",
    "these equations   must be solved numerically with the previous knowledge of the equilibrium positions  , and yield the following quadratic phonon hamiltonian @xmath66 where the index @xmath62 labels the normal modes with an increasing vibrational frequency @xmath67 .",
    "we now discuss a qualitative picture for the phonon branches valid for all the different ladders .",
    "as argued above , the transverse phonon modes are weakly coupled due to the small parameter @xmath68 . by inspecting eq .",
    ", one realizes that this condition will lead to a transverse phonon branch @xmath69 $ ] with a small width around the trap frequency @xmath70 ( see fig .",
    "[ ladder_scheme_phonons]*(a ) * ) .",
    "this property is not fulfilled by the planar modes @xmath71 $ ] , which are more strongly coupled @xmath53 , and will thus present a wider branch around @xmath72 .",
    "however , due to the frequency anisotropy @xmath11 , the planar phonon branch will always be situated far away from the transverse - mode frequencies , even if its width is considerably larger .",
    "this property will turn out to be essential for the qs of frustrated spin models  @xcite , whereby the role of the spin is played by two electronic levels of the ion , and the interactions are mediated by the collective vibrational excitations .",
    "the main idea is that such a clustered phonon spectrum will allow us to use a pair of laser beams that only couple the spins to the transverse phonon modes , even when the radiation resulting from the interference also propagates along the plane of the ladder ( fig .",
    "[ ladder_scheme_phonons]*(b ) * ) .",
    "the interest of this idea is two - fold . on the one hand ,",
    "the transverse phonon modes are the ideal mediators of the spin - spin interactions due to their higher insensitivity to ion - heating and their lower contributions to the thermal noise in the qs , as compared to the planar modes . on the other hand , by using a laser configuration with a component along the rungs of the ladder , we can exploit the ratio of its effective wavelength with the ion mutual distances in order to tailor the sign ( ferromagnetic / antiferromagnetic ) and the magnitude of the spin - spin interactions anisotropically ( i.e. depending on the direction joining the pair of ions ) . as shown below",
    ", this opens the possibility of realizing a versatile qs of frustrated quantum spin ladders , which is amenable of being scaled to larger ion numbers and a variety of geometries .",

    "the use of the collective vibrational modes as a common data bus to perform two - qubit gates can also be understood in terms of phonon - mediated spin - spin interactions  @xcite , which opens the route towards the qs of quantum magnetism  @xcite .",
    "we now introduce the key ingredient for such qss , namely , a spin - phonon coupling that originates from a laser - induced state - dependent dipole force  @xcite .",
    "so far , our discussion applies to all ion species and radio - frequency traps .",
    "however , in order to exploit the phonons as mediators of a spin - spin interaction that is sufficiently strong , the trap frequencies for each particular ion species must be tuned such that @xmath78 - 10 @xmath79 m , and @xmath80 .",
    "this typically constraints the order of magnitude of the trap frequencies to the range @xmath81 0.1 - 1 mhz , and @xmath82 1 - 10 mhz .",
    "moreover , since we aim at a flexible control of the anisotropy of the spin couplings , we shall focus on the ion species that allow for a two - photon lambda scheme to implement the spin - phonon coupling . hence , our discussion will be specific to singly ionized alkaline - earth ions , either with a hyperfine structure @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 , or with a pair of zeeman - split levels such as @xmath86 and @xmath87  @xcite .    in fig .",

    ", the ground - state manifold will be split into a pair of zeeman states ( @xmath93 ) , or a set of hyperfine levels ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "we select two of such states @xmath95 , which are separated by an energy gap @xmath96 , to form the effective spins of our qs ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ level_scheme ] ) . for hyperfine spins ,",
    "the energy splitting is @xmath97 1 - 10 ghz , whereas for zeeman spins its order of magnitude depends on the external magnetic field @xmath9810 ghz / t .     with an energy difference @xmath96",
    "are selected from the ground - state manifold @xmath99 to form an effective spin-1/2 .",
    "these states can be manipulated by a pair of laser beams with rabi frequencies @xmath100 that induce a transition to an excited state @xmath101 in the @xmath102 manifold from the spin state @xmath103 in @xmath99 .",
    "note that the transition wavelength @xmath104 lies in the optical regime .",
    "when the beatnote @xmath105 is tuned close to the trap frequency @xmath70 , such that the detuning @xmath106 is much larger than the spontaneous decay rate @xmath107 of the transition and the rabi frequencies , one obtains the desired state - dependent dipole force . ]    accordingly , the resonance frequencies usually lie in the radio - frequency / microwave regime .",
    "however , it is not customary to use radio - frequency / microwave radiation to couple the spins to the collective vibrational modes , since its wavelength is much larger than the typical ion oscillations ( but see the recent experimental progress  @xcite ) .",
    "a possible alternative is to use a pair of laser beams with optical frequencies @xmath108 @xmath109 , a `` moving standing wave '' , to induce a two - photon stimulated raman transition through an excited state @xmath110 ( see fig .",
    "[ level_scheme ] ) . when the laser beams are far off - resonant with respect to this dipole - allowed transition , such that the detuning @xmath106 is much larger than the decay rate of the excited state @xmath107 and the laser rabi frequencies @xmath111 , where @xmath103 , it is possible to eliminate the excited state from the dynamics and obtain a hamiltonian that only involves the spins and the phonons ( see appendix  [ appendix_dipole ] for the effective master equation ) .",
    "in particular , when the laser beatnote is @xmath112 ( fig .",
    "[ ladder_scheme_phonons]*(a ) * ) , one obtains the following ion - laser hamiltonian @xmath113 which can be interpreted as a time - dependent differential ac - stark shift due to the interference of the two laser beams . here , we have introduced @xmath114 , and the two - photon differential rabi frequency @xmath115 .",
    "the corrections due to the spontaneous decay from the excited level contribute to the rabi frequency with @xmath116 , and can be thus neglected if @xmath117 .",
    "the idea is that by controlling experimentally the polarizations , intensities and detunings of the laser beams , one can find regimes where the effective rabi frequency @xmath118 does not vanish and leads to a spin - dependent dipole force .",
    "let us note that the adiabatic elimination also leads to standard ac - stark shifts and to a running wave that only couples to the vibrational excitations .",
    "these terms must be compensated by carefully selecting the laser - beam parameters .",
    "let us finally emphasize that the effective raman wavevector @xmath119 has a component along the ladder plane ( see fig .",
    "[ ladder_scheme_phonons]*(b ) * ) , and in principle couples to both the planar and transverse phonons .",
    "the reason for the announced decoupling from the planar vibrational modes is that the beatnote of the laser beams , which is near the resonance of the transverse phonons , will lie far off - resonance with respect to the planar vibrational modes ( fig .",

    "this qualitative argument will be quantified below , and supported numerically in sec  [ section_zz ] .    after introducing the phonon operators in eq .",

    "for the small transverse and planar lamb - dicke parameters @xmath120 by setting @xmath121 , such that the bare detuning fulfills @xmath122 , one can neglect all non - resonant terms apart from a state - dependent dipole force that couples the spins to the transverse phonons . in the interaction picture with respect to the phonon hamiltonian",
    ", we get @xmath123 where @xmath124 .",
    "we note that , in order to neglect all the remaining terms of the taylor expansion , a rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) must be performed , provided that @xmath125 the first condition is required to neglect the off - resonant contributions to the ac - stark shift of the energy levels . additionally , by virtue of eq .",

    "for the regime considered in this work , namely @xmath126 , it will suffice to consider @xmath127 0.1 - 1 mhz to accomplish this constraint .",
    "the second condition in   is necessary to avoid that the dipole force also couples the spins to the planar phonons .",
    "hence , it characterizes the parameter regime where our previous qualitative discussion about the decoupling of the planar vibrational modes holds .",

    "depending on the spin state , the dipole force in eq",
    ".   pushes the ions in opposite directions transversally to the ladder plane .",
    "besides , the phase of this pushing force depends on the ratio of the ion equilibrium positions and the effective wavelength of the interfering laser beams .",
    "as shown below , this is precisely the parameter that shall allow us to control the anisotropy of the effective spin - spin couplings .",
    "there are numerous situations in nature where interactions are mediated by the exchange of particles .",
    "of particular relevance to the field of magnetism is the so - called ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rrky ) mechanism  @xcite , whereby a heisenberg coupling between distant nuclear spins is mediated by electrons from the conduction band of a metal .",
    "the sign of the heisenberg couplings alternates between ferromagnetic / antiferromagnetic as a function of the ratio between the fermi wavelength and the mutual spin distance .",
    "we have recently shown  @xcite that a similar phenomenon occurs for trapped - ion ladders subjected to the dipole force in eq .  . instead of a heisenberg - type interaction between the nuclear spins , one obtains a periodically - modulated ising - type coupling between the spins formed by two electronic states of the ion .",
    "interestingly enough , the modulation can be experimentally tailored by controlling the direction of propagation of the interfering laser beams providing the dipole force .",

    ". the exact expression can be obtained by a lang - firsov - type transformation  @xcite that decouples the spins from the phonons @xmath130 this canonical transformation leads to an effective hamiltonian @xmath131 , where we consider a picture such that the vibrational hamiltonian @xmath132   absorbs the time - dependence of the dipole force @xmath133  , namely @xmath134 , where @xmath135 .",

    "this sign alternation is similar to that found in rkky metals , such that the transverse phonons play the role of the conduction electrons , and the wavelength of the interfering laser beams acts as the fermi wavelength . in the regime of interest for the ladders , @xmath140 , the couplings @xmath141 display a dipolar decay law , where we have introduced @xmath142 such that @xmath143 is the bare lamb - dicke parameter . from these expressions",

    "conversely , the interactions between the spins from different legs of the ladder ( @xmath146 ) can be ferromagnetic @xmath147 or antiferromagnetic @xmath145 depending on the laser parameters .",
