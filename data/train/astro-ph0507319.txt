    "the kuiper belt is the vast swarm of small bodies that inhabit the outer solar system beyond the orbit of neptune .",
    "these kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) that inhabit this belt are relics of the solar system s primordial planetesimal disk ",
    "they are bits of debris that failed to coalesce into other large planets .",
    "the kuiper belt is also of great interest since it preserves a record of the outer solar system s early dynamical history .",
    "this is reflected in the kbos curious distribution of orbits , which suggest that there was considerable readjustment of the solar system s early architecture . the possibility that the orbits of the giant planets may have shifted significantly ( that is , after the solar nebula gas had already dissipated )",
    "was first demonstrated by the accretion simulations of @xcite ; they showed that as the growing giant planets gravitationally scatter the residual planetesimal debris , they can exchange angular momentum with the debris disk in a way that causes the planets orbits to drift .",
    "@xcite later showed that an episode of outwards migration by neptune by at least @xmath10 au could also account for pluto s peculiar orbit , which resides at neptune s 3:2 resonance with an eccentricity of @xmath11 . in this scenario ,",
    "pluto s large eccentricity is a consequence of it having been captured by neptune s advancing 3:2 resonance , which pumped pluto s @xmath12 up as it shepherded the small planet outwards .",
    "further support for this planet ",
    "migration scenario is provided by the subsequent discovery of numerous other kbos also inhabiting neptune s 3:2 resonance with eccentricities similar to model predictions @xcite , as well as by more modern nbody simulations of the orbital evolution of giant planets while they are still embedded in a massive planetesimal disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to use higher  resolution simulations to update this conventional model of neptune s migration into the kuiper belt .",
    "this model s strengths , as well as its weaknesses , will be assessed quantitatively by rigorously comparing the simulations endstates to current observations of the belt . in the following , we execute two simulations that track the orbital evolution of the four migrating giant planets plus @xmath13 massless test particles ( the latter representing the kbos ) over the age of the solar system . in one simulation",
    "the initial state of the kuiper belt is dynamically cold ( _ i.e. _ , the particles have initial eccentricities and inclinations of @xmath12 and @xmath14 ) , while the second simulation is of a kuiper belt that is initially stirred  up a modest amount ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath12 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "we then use a monte carlo method to assign sizes ( and hence magnitudes ) to the simulated kbos ; this allows us to account for the telescopic biases that tends to select those kbos that inhabit orbits that are more favorable for discovery over those kbos in less favorable orbits .",
    "then , by comparing the resulting model kuiper belts with the current observational data , we rigorously test the planet ",
    "migration scenario as well as obtain a more realistic assessment of the abundance of kbos .",
    "this analysis will also provide the relative abundance of the belt s various subpopulations ",
    "the resonant kbos , the main belt objects , the scattered disk , plus the centaurs and neptune s trojans .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ model ] describes the so ",
    "called ` standard model ' that is considered here , as well as the numerical methods to be employed . results from two simulations of the kuiper belt are reported in sections [ cold ] and [ hot ] , while section [ i ] examines the kuiper belt inclination problem .",
    "section [ census ] details the monte carlo model that is then used in sections [ edge][extendedsd ] to assess the relative abundance of the belt s various subpopulations , with a final tally of the belt s total population given in section [ calibration ] .",
    "section [ unmodeled ] comments on some important unmodeled effects , and section [ discussion ] summarizes the results .",
    "the mercury6 nbody integrator @xcite is used to track the orbital evolution of the four giant planets plus numerous massless particles . in our simulations , planet migration",
    "is implemented by applying an external torque to each planet s orbit so that its semimajor axis @xmath16 varies as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is planet @xmath19 s final semimajor axis , @xmath20 is the planet s net radial displacement , and @xmath21 is the e  fold timescale for planet migration ; this form of planet migration was first used in @xcite . to implement this in mercury6 ,",
    "the integrator is modified so that each planet s velocity @xmath22 is incremented by the small velocity kick @xmath23 with each timestep @xmath24 .",
    "this additional velocity kick is directed along the planet s velocity vector , and results in a torque @xmath25 being applied to each planet . since @xmath26 where @xmath27 the planet s angular momentum , these velocity kicks cause the planet s orbit to vary at the rate @xmath28 , which then recovers eqn .",
    "( [ a_j(t ) ] ) when integrated .    the simulations reported below adopt the current planets masses and orbits as initial conditions , except that their initial semimajor axes are displaced by an amount @xmath29 so that the migration torque ultimately delivers these planets into orbits similar to their present ones .",
    "the free parameters that describe this migration are the planets radial displacements @xmath20 and the migration timescale @xmath21 . at present , there is only one strong constraint on the @xmath20 s , namely , that neptune s orbit must expand by @xmath30 au if resonance trapping is to account for the kbos having eccentricities of @xmath31 at neptune s 3:2 resonance ( see appendix [ appendix_bi ] ) .",
    "another constraint , on the magnitude of jupiter s inward migration , can be obtained from the orbital distribution of asteroids in the outer asteroid belt .",
    "@xcite show that the severe depletion of the outer asteroid belt can be explained if jupiter migrated inward by at least 0.2 au , and franklin et al ( 2004 ) show that the orbits of the hilda asteroids at jupiter s 3:2 resonance are consistent with jupiter having migrated inwards by about 0.45 au .",
    "the remaining @xmath20 s for saturn and uranus are less well  constrained , but stability considerations require them to be neither too large nor too small . with this in mind , our simulations adopt the following values for the @xmath20 s : @xmath32 au for jupiter , @xmath33 au for saturn , @xmath34 au for uranus , and @xmath35 au for neptune .",
    "all of the simulations reported here also employ a planet  migration timescale of @xmath36 years .",
    "this value is supported by the self  consistent nbody simulations by @xcite of the giant planets migration while they are embedded in a planetesimal disk .",
    "those simulations show that a planetesimal disk having a mass @xmath37 m@xmath6 spread over @xmath38 au will cause neptune s orbit to expand @xmath39 au over a characteristic timescale of @xmath40 years ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we note that the orbital evolution adopted here is constructed so that the migrating planets eccentricities are always comparable to their present values , and that the migration proceeds along nearly circular orbits . but this particular choice for the planets eccentricities is merely a simplifying assumption since we do not know the @xmath12-evolution of the giant planets during the migration epoch .",
    "for instance , it is possible that dynamical friction with the particle disk would have conspired to keep the planets eccentricities low , but there may also have been other transient protoplanets roaming about the outer solar system , and their perturbations would tend to pump up the planets eccentricities . given the uncertainty in the relative rates of these effects , we adopt the simplest possible model , one that assumes that the giant planets eccentricities were always comparable to their present one .",
    "however alternate migration schemes are possible ; for instance , @xcite consider a scenario where the giant planets pump up their eccentricities as they pass through mutual resonances .",
    "but it is uncertain as to whether this possible history would have altered the bulk properties of the kuiper belt , and it is not considered here .    in order to enforce migration in nearly circular orbits , our simulations have jupiter migrating outwards @xmath41 au , whereas other self  consistent simulations show that jupiter usually migrates inwards a small amount @xcite .",
    "note that this choice avoids having jupiter approach the 5:2 resonance with saturn , which tends to excite the planets eccentricities above current levels .",
    "but that eccentricity excitation might then have been damped back to current levels by dynamical friction with the particle disk , but that is a phenomena that goes unmodeled in our massless particle disk .",
    "we simply avoid this event altogether by instead having jupiter migrate outwards a modest amount .",
    "but this not a concern here since our interest is in the kuiper belt , whose endstate is not likely to preserve any memory of whether jupiter migrated slightly inwards or outwards .",
    "the remaining @xmath20 s are similarly chosen to avoid all major resonances , and the simulated planets semimajor axes @xmath42 are also shown in fig .  [ migrate ] .    in the simulations described below",
    ", the model kuiper belt is initially composed of @xmath13 massless particles having semimajor axes randomly distributed over @xmath43 au with a surface number density that varies as @xmath44 .",
    "the inner edge of this particle disk is 1.4 au inwards of neptune s initial semimajor axis , and the disk extends well beyond the outer reaches of the observed main belt . all simulations described here use a timestep of @xmath45 years , which is sufficiently short to accurately evolve particles in eccentric orbits down to perihelia as low as @xmath46 au without suffering the perihelion instability described in @xcite .",
    "of course , particles can still achieve orbits having perihelia lower than @xmath47 , but their orbits will not be calculated correctly in our simulations .",
    "however this is of little consequence since these planet  crossing bodies have very short dynamical lifetimes and are quickly removed from the system anyway .",
    "accretion models have shown that the observed kbo population must have formed in an environment that was initially dynamically cold , that is , the known kbos must have formed from seeds that were in nearly circular and coplanar orbits with initial @xmath12 s and @xmath48 s that were @xmath49 @xcite . in anticipation of this , many investigations of the dynamical history of the kuiper belt have adopted initial kbo orbits that are dynamically cold ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ cold belt ] shows the results of a simulation of neptune s smooth migration into a dynamically cold swarm of massless kuiper belt objects having initial @xmath12 s that are rayleigh distributed about a mean value @xmath50 , and initial inclinations similarly distributed with a mean @xmath51 .",
    "this system is evolved for @xmath52 years . as is well known from previous studies , neptune s smooth migration is very efficient at inserting particles into the planet s mean  motion resonances , principally the 2:1 , 5:3 , and the 3:2 .",
    "however , it is also well recognized that the endstate of this idealized model differs from the observed kbo orbits ( the red dots in fig .",
    "[ cold belt ] ) in several ways .",
    "for example , one prominent discrepancy is that the 2:1 resonance is densely populated with simulated particles while only sparsely populated by observed kbos .",
    "however the discrepancy that is most important to this discussion lies in the @xmath53 au zone between the 7:4 and the 2:1 resonances , which is the outer half of the main belt that is conventionally defined as the region between the 3:2 and 2:1 resonances .",
    "although these simulated particles managed to slip through the advancing 2:1 resonance , they still reside in orbits that are only modestly disturbed with @xmath54 and @xmath55 , whereas the observed kbos inhabit orbits that are considerably more excited .",
    "thus neptune s smooth migration into a dynamically cold kuiper belt is unable to account for the belt s stirred  up state .",
    "evidently , some other event has also disturbed the kuiper belt , and this stirring event may have taken place prior to or after the onset of neptune s migration",
    ". however section [ hot ] provides reason to believe that this stirring event occurred before the onset of neptune s migration into the kuiper belt .",
    "to examine the effects of neptune s migration and its resonance sweeping of a previously stirred  up kuiper belt population , we repeat the numerical integrations with @xmath13 simulated kbos , but with initial @xmath12 s rayleigh distributed about a mean value of @xmath56 and initial @xmath57 s distributed similarly about a mean value of @xmath51 . however this time",
    "the simulation is evolved for the age of the solar system , 4.5 gyrs , with fig .",
    "[ hot belt ] showing the resulting kuiper belt endstate .",
    "first , we note that in this case we find an outer solar system that is far more depleted in transient particles like centaurs ( which are scattered particles having semimajor axes interior to neptune ) and scattered disk objects [ which are particles that were lofted into eccentric neptune  crossing orbits due to a close ",
    "encounter with neptune @xcite ] ; those bodies usually reside in orbits having perihelia @xmath58 between the @xmath59 and @xmath60 au curves seen in figs .",
    "[ cold belt][hot belt ] .",
    "this difference is primarily due to the simulation s longer integration time .",
    "another prominent difference with the ` cold belt ' simulation is that neptune s weaker higher  order resonances , such as the 3:1 and 5:2 , are considerably more efficient at capturing particles when neptune migrates into a hot disk , a phenomenon that was first noted by @xcite .",
    "this result was rather surprising , because low - order resonance capture theory theory predicts a generally lower capture probability for particles having higher eccentricities @xcite .",
    "however , a careful examination of the theory of adiabatic resonance capture ( e.g. , @xcite ) shows that there are two reasons for this result .",
    "( 1 ) the higher order resonances have capture probabilities that drop off more slowly with eccentricity than first order resonances : although the 1st order resonance capture probability varies as @xmath61 , the 2nd order resonance capture probability falls off more slowly as @xmath62 while the 3rd order resonance capture probability varies as @xmath63 .",
    "( 2 ) the threshold migration speeds for adiabatic resonance capture are also lower for the higher order resonances , and they also depend more strongly upon the initial eccentricities . for capture at a @xmath64 resonance , the requirement for adiabatic resonance capture",
    "is that neptune s migrate rate , which is @xmath65 au / yr in these simulations , be sufficiently slow , namely , that @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are neptune s mass and orbital period , and @xmath69 is a function of laplace coefficients .",
    "for example , the 5:2 resonance has @xmath70 , so the migration speed threshold that permits adiabatic resonance sweeping is @xmath71 au / yr among particles having @xmath72 , while the threshold is reduced to @xmath73 au / yr among particles having @xmath74 .",
    "it is clear then that a dynamically cold particle swarm has no chance of adiabatic capture at neptune s high  order mean  motion resonances , while particles that are stirred up to @xmath72 are at least near the threshold for adiabatic resonance capture . and",
    "as @xcite point out , the fact that seven eccentric kbos are known to librate at neptune s 5:2 resonance also lends support to the pre - stirred kuiper belt scenario .",
    "another advantage of this stirred  up kuiper belt scenario is that it recovers eccentricities that are observed to be as large as @xmath75 in the main belt that lies between the 3:2 and 2:1 resonances at @xmath76 au ( the red dots in fig .",
    "[ hot belt ] ) .",
    "this is a feature that the cold belt scenario ( fig .",
    "[ cold belt ] ) does not account for .",
    "of course , fig .",
    "[ hot belt ] also shows that the simulated main belt is densely populated by low ",
    "eccentricity particles having @xmath54 at @xmath77 au , whereas the observed kuiper belt is only sparely populated here . but section [ edge ] will show that there are a variety of possible explanations for this discrepancy  such a change in the kbo size distribution , or perhaps an outer edge in the primordial kuiper belt .",
    "figure [ hot belt ] also shows that trapping at the distant high  order resonances like the 5:2 and 3:1 is quite effective at promoting bodies into eccentric orbits having @xmath78 au and perihelia @xmath79 au .",
    "this domain is usually regarded as the scattered disk .",
    "this result then suggests the possibility that some of the observed kbos in the @xmath79 au zone may actually be resonantly trapped bodies that are masquerading as members of the scattered disk . of course",
    ", particles scattered by neptune also tend to spend a large fraction of their time near resonances due to the resonance sticking phenomenon ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the discrimination between scattered and resonantly trapped particles must be done carefully . towards this end , we examine the orbital histories of all surviving particles in the shaded zone in fig .",
    "[ sd ] that have @xmath80 and @xmath9 au .",
    "the usual definition of being ` in ' a @xmath64 mean motion resonance is that the particle s resonance angle @xmath81 , eqn .",
    "( [ phi_jk ] ) , librates about some fixed value with some modest amplitude @xmath82 that is usually @xmath83 , while the resonance angle for a scattered body that is temporarily ` stuck ' in a resonance will have a @xmath81 that circulates over @xmath84 . however , we find that @xmath82 is not the best discriminant for identifying trapped and scattered particles because a small but significant fraction of particles do get trapped at a resonance with a @xmath81 that is either circulating or else librating with a very large amplitude . for some trapped particles ,",
    "this distinction is unclear due to this simulation s infrequent time  sampling that occurs every @xmath85 years .",
    "rather , a more reliable discriminant between trapped and scattered particles is based on brouwer s integral @xmath86 , eqn .",
    "( [ b ] ) .",
    "this integral is conserved by resonantly trapped particles but is not conserved by scattered particles that are temporarily exhibiting the ` resonance sticking ' phenomenon .",
    "of the 134 particles that inhabit the gray zone in fig .",
    "[ sd ] , only 12 , or about @xmath87 of these particles , are truly scattered particles whose orbits @xmath88 evolve stochastically about the @xmath79 au zone ; these scattered particles are indicated by the crosses in fig .",
    "the remaining particles are resonantly trapped particles , most s and @xmath57 s of some resonantly trapped particles will still oscillate with constant @xmath89 in a manner that preserves their jacobi integral ; this evolution usually occurs after migration has ceased , and these particular motions do _ not _ preserve @xmath86 . ]",
    "of which preserved their @xmath86 integral to within @xmath90 .",
    "the orbits of all particles having perihelia @xmath91 au have also been inspected , and those resonances inhabited by trapped particles having libration amplitudes @xmath92 are indicated by the vertical dashes in the figure .",
    "we find that particles get trapped at a number of exotic resonances like the 11:6 , 13:7 , 13:6 , 9:4 , 12:5 , 8:3 , and the 11:4 .",
    "inspection of the inclinations shown in fig .",
    "[ hot belt ] suggests that the smooth migration model does not produce sufficient numbers of bodies in high  inclination orbits .",
    "this has been recognized in previous studies ( @xcite ) , but has not been quantified .",
    "however one should not directly compare the simulation s",
    "@xmath57 s to the observed kbo inclinations , since the latter is heavily biased by telescopic selection effects .",
    "note that most telescopic surveys of the kuiper belt observe near the ecliptic , which favors the discovery of lower@xmath57 kbos that spend a larger fraction of their time at lower latitudes @xcite . to mitigate this selection effect",
    ", one should instead consider the ecliptic inclination distribution , which is the inclination distribution of objects having latitudes @xmath93 very near the ecliptic ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the ecliptic inclination distribution for multi  opposition kbos having perihelia @xmath94 au and latitudes @xmath95 ( red curve ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ idist ] , as well as the simulated ecliptic inclination distribution for particles from fig .",
    "[ hot belt ] that are selected similarly ( black curve ) .",
    "the agreement seen in fig .",
    "[ idist ] among bodies having inclinations of @xmath96 shows that the smooth migration model can readily recover the kuiper belt s lower inclination members . of course",
    ", this agreement is partly due to the particles initial inclinations being distributed around @xmath97 . but fig .",
    "[ idist ] also shows this model to be quite deficient in producing sufficient numbers of the high@xmath57 bodies having @xmath98 .",
    "similar results are also obtained among bodies orbiting at neptune s 3:2 resonance .",
    "this is a serious discrepancy , since @xcite has shown that there are two inclination  populations in the kuiper belt : a minor population of low@xmath57 having characteristic inclinations of @xmath99 , and a high@xmath57 population having @xmath100 containing about three ",
    "quarters of all kbos .",
    "note that these high@xmath57 bodies are very underrepresented in fig .",
    "[ idist ] due to telescopic selection effects .",
    "of course , neptune  scattered particles routinely achieve high inclinations of @xmath98 ; for instance , many of the high@xmath57 particles seen in fig .",
    "[ cold belt ] were scattered by neptune .",
    "could the scattered disk be a source of the high@xmath57 kbos that are found elsewhere in the belt ?",
    "recent nbody simulations by @xcite show that a small fraction of these neptune  scattered particles can evolve from very eccentric , neptune  crossing orbits into less eccentric orbits in the main belt . in gomes simulations , this occurs principally at secular and mean motion resonances that drive large oscillations in a scattered particle s eccentricity .",
    "when a scattered particle visits a resonance , it can have its @xmath12 temporarily lowered and its @xmath58 raised . if this occurs during the planet ",
    "migration epoch , this process becomes irreversible and can strand scattered particles in the main belt with their high inclinations .",
    "such bodies are identified by gomes as ` evaders ' since they are neptune  crossing bodies that ultimately manage to evade neptune when deposited in the main belt .",
    "note , however , that the efficiency of this process is quite low , affecting only @xmath101 of all scattered particles in the simulation that is evolved over the age of the solar system by @xcite .",
    "however all of the high@xmath57 particles seen in our simulation ( fig .",
    "[ hot belt ] ) achieved their inclinations while temporarily or permanently trapped in neptune s advancing resonances .",
    "there were no neptune  scattered evaders having @xmath102 that survived in our simulations .    despite the evader mechanism s inefficiency , a model",
    "can still be constructed that yields a kbo inclination distribution that is quite similar to the observed one .",
    "for instance , this can be achieved by making the number density of small bodies initially orbiting interior to @xmath103 au about 60 times higher than the density of bodies initially orbiting beyond 27 au .",
    "as @xcite show , neptune s migration through this densely  populated inner disk creates the kuiper belt s high@xmath57 evaders , while the sparse outer disk provides the belt s low@xmath57 component .",
    "although this scheme yields an @xmath57distribution that does indeed agree with the observations , that success is achieved via a special configuration of the initial particle disk .",
    "however , @xcite avoid this problem of special initial conditions by assuming that the initial planetesimal disk simply ended at @xmath104 au .",
    "this is the ` push  out ' model , which argues that most of the kuiper belt is a consequence of neptune s advancing 2:1 resonance , which can drag bodies outwards to litter the main belt with low@xmath57 kbos .",
    "the belt s high@xmath57 component is then presumed to be due to the evader mechanism .",
    "while the push  out model remains quite intriguing , it would be interesting to see this scenario subjected to greater scrutiny to see whether it can indeed reproduce the kuiper belt s curious mix of high and low inclination kbos in a self  consistent manner .",
    "figure [ abundance ] plots the relative abundance , over time , of the simulated belt s various dynamical classes among particles having perihelia @xmath105 au .",
    "these curves are normalized such that the final abundance of the main belt ( mb ) , where @xmath106 au , is unity .",
    "note that this model predicts a 2:1 resonance that is 1.4 times more abundant than the main belt , and 2.5 times more abundant than the 3:2 , while the observations ( fig .",
    "[ hot belt ] ) show a 2:1 that is only sparsely populated .",
    "of course , when comparing the simulated population to the observed population , one must first deal with the observational selection effect that strongly favors the discovery of larger and/or nearer kbos .",
    "however it is shown below that the effects of this bias can be accounted for by using a monte carlo method that assigns random sizes to the simulated population .",
    "this then allows one to make a fair comparison of the relative abundances of the simulated and observed populations .",
    "begin by letting @xmath107 the number of bodies in the simulated population having radii exceeding a radius @xmath108 .",
    "also let @xmath109 be a random number that is uniformly distributed between zero and one , and interpret this number as the probability of selecting a body with a radius that is smaller than @xmath108 .",
    "this is also equal to the probability of _ not _ selecting a body of radius @xmath110 , so @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the total number of bodies in this population .",
    "since most small  body populations have a cumulative size distribution @xmath113 that varies as a power law , adopt @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the radius of the smallest member of the swarm .",
    "then @xmath116 , but @xmath117 can be replaced with @xmath109 since these random numbers have the same distribution , so @xmath118 equation ( [ rrandom ] ) is then used to generate random sizes for the simulated population of fig .",
    "[ hot belt ] that have apparent r  band magnitudes of @xmath119\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath120 is the particle s heliocentric distance , @xmath121 au , @xmath122 is the sun s apparent @xmath108 magnitude , @xmath123 km is adopted here , and the observation is presumed to occur at solar opposition .",
    "all of our calculations will also adopt the usual albedo of @xmath124 so that our findings can be readily compared to past results obtained by others .",
    "however if an alternate albedo @xmath8 is desired , simply revise all kbo radii reported here by a factor of @xmath125 , and all masses by a factor of @xmath126 . finally , note that a power  law size distribution results in a cumulative luminosity function that varies as @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the sky  plane number density of kbos brighter than apparent magnitude @xmath129 and the logarithmic slope is @xmath130 @xcite .",
    "hubble space telescope observations reveal that the bright end of the kuiper belt s luminosity function has a steep logarithmic slope of @xmath131 for bodies having magnitudes @xmath132 , while the faint end ( @xmath133 ) of the luminosity function has a shallow logarithmic slope of @xmath134 @xcite ; the steeper slope of the bright end of the luminosity function was also confirmed recently by @xcite .",
    "this luminosity function can be interpreted as evidence that the kbo size distribution is actually two power laws that break even at a magnitude @xmath135 , which corresponds to a body of radius @xmath136 km orbiting at a characteristic distance of @xmath137 au assuming it has an albedo of @xmath124 .",
    "however our application will concentrate only on those kbos that have known orbits , and @xmath138 of those bodies have magnitudes @xmath139 .",
    "consequently , this study will be sensitive only to the larger end of the kbo size spectrum , and such bodies will be characterized here via a single power ",
    "law size distribution having @xmath140 and @xmath141 .    although @xmath142 simulated particles in fig .",
    "[ hot belt ] manage to survive over the age of the solar system , the monte carlo model assigns far too few of them with sizes that would be detected by any telescopic survey of the kuiper belt . to boost the statistics of the detectable portion of the simulated population , each survivor is replicated @xmath13 times such that each particle s orbit elements @xmath143 are preserved while its mean anomaly @xmath144 is randomly distributed over @xmath145 .",
    "it should be noted that this step effectively assumes that the particles longitudes are uniformly distributed over @xmath146 , which is not quite correct since neptune s resonant perturbations tend to arrange the particles longitudes in a non  uniform manner @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , this is not a major concern since the observed kbos were discovered along lines  of  sight that are roughly distributed uniformly in ecliptic longitude , which effectively washes  out neptune s azimuthal arrangement of the belt ; see appendix [ symmetry ] for a more detailed examination and justification of this assumption .",
    "lastly , this monte carlo model is then tested by verifying that the randomly generated population does indeed exhibit the expected luminosity function that varies as @xmath147 .",
    "further comparison of the monte carlo model of the kuiper belt to any observations must be done carefully . note that the brighter kbos tend to be discovered in shallow , wide ",
    "angle surveys that observe a large area @xmath148 on the sky , while the fainter kbos tend to be discovered in deeper surveys that observe smaller areas @xmath148 .",
    "consequently , the observed abundances of the various kbo subclasses ( e.g. , the main belt , the scattered disk , _ etc .",
    "_ ) are proportional to all of these surveys total area @xmath149 , which itself is some function of the limiting magnitude @xmath150 .",
    "however appendix [ appendix_ratios ] shows that this dependence upon @xmath149 can be factored out by constructing ratios of the belt s various subclasses .",
    "that appendix also shows that the ratios of the observed abundance of any two dynamical classes of kbos is approximately equal to the ratio of the intrinsic abundances of the much larger unseen populations . ] .",
    "thus by plotting _ ratios _ of the simulated populations to the observed kbo populations , we can compare the model to the observations in a manner that is insensitive to survey details like their individual sky ",
    "coverage @xmath148 .",
    "figure [ ratios ] shows the apparent abundances of the 2:1 and the 3:2 populations relative to the main belt ( mb ) as a function of their @xmath108band magnitudes @xmath150 .",
    "the upper light gray curve is the simulated ratio , which predicts an apparent 2:1 abundance that is about @xmath151 of the mb , while the dark gray curve is the observed ratio .",

    "the observed 3:2/mb ratio plotted in figure [ ratios ] also shows that this resonant population is underabundant relative to model predictions by a factor of @xmath159 among bright objects with @xmath160 , and by a factor of @xmath161 at fainter magnitudes .",

    "[ ratios ] are not particularly sensitive to the detailed location of the main belt s outer edge . for instance , if we assumed the belt s primordial edge where instead at @xmath163 au ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also section [ edge ] ) , this reduces the 2:1 and mb populations both by about 40% while leaving the 3:2 population unchanged .",

    "[ ratios ] , the most plausible explanation is that other unmodeled processes are responsible for ( _ i. _ ) reducing the trapping efficiencies of the 2:1 and 3:2 resonances by factors of @xmath15960 , or ( _ ii . _ ) causing trapped particles to diffuse out of the resonances and into nearby regions of phase space that are quite unstable ( cf .",
    "fig .  1 of @xcite )",
    ", resulting in their ejection from the kuiper belt .",
    "such unmodeled processes include the collisions and gravitational scatterings that occurred with ever greater vigor during earlier times when the belt was more crowded .",
    "the scattering of these planetesimals by neptune was of course responsible for driving that planet s migration , so the occasional scattering of a large and/or close planetesimal will cause that planet s orbit and hence its resonances to shudder some . likewise ,",
    "scattering events among the kbos themselves would also cause their semimajor axes to diffuse some , as would collisions .",
    "this means that scatterings and collisions will have driven a random walk in the resonant particles semimajor axes , as well as a random walk in the location of the resonances themselves .",
    "it is possible then that these unmodeled effects can drive particles out of resonances and reduce the resonant population by the large factors indicated by fig .",
    "[ ratios ] , a scenario that is also explored in simulations by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the magnitude dependence of the observed 3:2/mb ratio shown in fig .",

    "one way for the model to achieve better agreement with the observations is to assume that larger , brighter bodies are more abundant in the 3:2 , and that smaller , fainter bodies are less abundant there than they are in the mb , which requires a shallower size distribution .",
    "the dashed curve in fig .  [ ratios ] illustrates this possibility , which shows the simulated 3:2/mb ratio assuming that the 3:2 bodies have a shallow @xmath167 size distribution with @xmath168 km ( note that reducing @xmath115 has the effect of reducing the total number of visible objects ) while the mb bodies have the usual distribution with @xmath169 and @xmath123 km .",

    "a comparable problem also occurs with the model s inclinations .",
    "section [ calibration ] shows that the simulated kuiper belt is too thin by a factor of @xmath371 .",
    "this is compensated for by reducing the simulation s luminosity function @xmath303 by the factor @xmath372 , which is equivalent to increasing each particles inclination by this factor .",
    "again , this crude treatment should still yield a reliable estimate of the kbo population provided the factor @xmath372 is uniform everywhere and independent of semimajor axis @xmath89 . if , however , @xmath372 is _ not _ independent of @xmath89 , then this will result in errors in the relative abundances of the belt s various subpopulations reported in table [ pop_table ] .",
    "we also note that the relative abundances of the belt s various subpopulations are determined by a model that invokes a smooth outward migration by neptune by @xmath373 au , with the results reported in fig .",
    "[ abundance ] .",
    "that figure shows that the smooth migration scenario predicts a combined 3:2 + 2:1 population that is comparable to the main belt population .",
    "this is because smooth migration is very efficient at trapping particles at neptune s resonances , and this results in densely populated resonances .",
    "however a detailed comparison of the model predictions to the observed abundances indicates that the resonant kbo population is really only about @xmath374 of the main belt population ( see section [ census ] and table [ pop_table ] ) .",
    "the seemingly low abundance of resonant kbos is likely due to unmodeled effects that may have occurred during the migration epoch , possibly due to the mutual scattering that might occur among bodies trapped at resonance , or perhaps due to the gravitational scattering of large planetesimals by neptune ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there is also evidence indicating that a wide swath of the early kuiper belt was stirred up prior to the onset of neptune s migration .",
    "recall that simulations of neptune s outward migration into a dynamically cold kuiper belt is unable to account for the eccentricities of @xmath72 observed among main belt kbos ( section [ cold belt ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the belt was stirred up , either prior to or after the onset of neptune s migration",
    ". however section [ hot belt ] shows that this stirring event likely occurred prior to migration : migration into a stirred  up kuiper belt facilitates trapping at a multitude of weak , high  order mean motion resonances which , as @xcite point out , is consistent with the detection of seven kbos now known to librate at neptune s 5:2 resonance .    it is then natural to ask what mechanism might be responsible for stirring  up a broad swath of the kuiper belt , particularly since accretion models tell us that kbos must have formed in a dynamically cold environment , _",
    "i.e. _ , the particles initial @xmath12 s and @xmath57 s were @xmath49 ( @xcite ) . note that this disturbance was probably not due to gravitational stirring by a number of long  gone protoplanets since , as @xcite point out , a sizable fraction of such bodies would still persist in the kuiper belt and would likely have been discovered by now .",
    "note that this stirring mechanism must also have had a large reach since it must afflict kbos across the entire main belt , at least out to neptune s 2:1 resonance .",
    "one mechanism that comes to mind is secular resonance sweeping , which is the only mechanism known to us that might stir eccentricities in the belt up to @xmath72 across its entire width @xcite .",
    "however this @xmath12excitation is coherent in the sense that neighboring particles will have similar eccentricities .",
    "so it is unclear whether secular resonance sweeping of the main belt , which would then followed by sweeping mean ",
    "motion resonances due to neptune s migration , will result in the range of eccentricities that is seen in fig .",
    "[ hot belt ] .",
    "secular resonance sweeping is a consequence of the dispersal of the solar nebula gas ; the removal of that gas alters the giant planets precession rates which in turn shifts the location of secular resonances @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the disturbance caused by a sweeping secular resonance depends on the timescale over which the nebula is depleted ; a longer depletion timescales @xmath375 results in larger eccentricity  pumping .",
    "the simulations of nebula dispersal by @xcite show that a disturbance of @xmath72 across much of the kuiper belt requires a nebula depletion timescale of @xmath376 years ( but see also @xcite ) .",
    "one of the goals of this study is to determine how the adoption of a particular kuiper belt model might affect an assessment of the belt s total population and mass .",
    "note that some models of the belt assume that the kbos are distributed according to a primordial surface density distribution that might vary with distance at @xmath377 or so ( e.g. , @xcite ) , while the kbos in another model are essentially equidistant @xcite .",
    "however fig .",
    "[ erosion ] shows that a realistic kuiper belt has been eroded from the inside  out by the giant planets gravitational perturbations , which suggests that the earlier models might not apply .",
    "however it turns out that an estimate of the total kbo population does _ not _ depend strongly upon a particular model s radial variation .",
    "as section [ calibration ] shows , all three models yield population estimates that are within a factor of @xmath158 of each other .",
    "this is because the observable kbos really do inhabit a relatively narrow belt centered on @xmath191 au having a radial half  width that is only @xmath378 au ( see fig .",
    "[ erosion ] ) , so the the assumption of equidistant kbos ( e.g. , @xcite ) appears to be good enough .",
    "it should also be noted that the magnitude interval over which a model kuiper belt can be compared to the observed belt is given by the brightness of those kbos having reliable orbits , and this sample is presently dominated by bodies having a relatively limited magnitude range of only @xmath379 .",
    "further testing of this model , as well as the development of alternative models of the belt , would be greatly facilitated if they could be compared to a larger sample of multi  opposition kbos having reliable orbits and also exhibiting a broader range of apparent magnitudes and sizes .",
    "this larger kbo sample would be very useful in many ways .",
    "for example , it could be used to test the possibility that the various kuiper belt subpopulations do exhibit variations in their size distributions ( e.g. , section [ census ] ) .",
    "this larger sample might also permit a better understanding of certain rare and unusual kbos , such as those that inhabit the extended scattered disk ( section [ extendedsd ] ) .",
    "a deeper understanding of the kuiper belt , and what the belt tells us about the early evolution of the outer solar system , would be facilitated by deeper kbo surveys over larger portions of the sky in a systematic way that leads to efficient kbo recoveries and reliable orbit determinations .",
    "* accretion models have shown that kuiper belt objects must have formed in a dynamically cold environment where the initial kbo seeds had nearly circular and coplanar orbits with eccentricities and inclinations @xmath380 @xcite .",
    "simulations of neptune s outwards migration into a dynamically cold kuiper belt , described in section [ cold ] , show that the survivors in the main belt still maintain low eccentricities and inclinations .",
    "however this conflicts with the main belt s observed @xmath12 s and @xmath48 s of @xmath292 .",
    "this discrepancy suggests that some other process has also stirred  up the kuiper belt .",
    "this stirring event could have occurred prior to or after the onset of planet migration . *",
    "the existence of several kbos librating at neptune s 5:2 resonance suggest that this stirring event occurred prior to the onset of planet migration .",
    "simulations by @xcite have shown that if neptune migrates into a stirred  up kuiper belt having eccentricities of @xmath72 , then trapping at neptune s higher  order resonances , such as the 5:2 , becomes more efficient .",
    "this result is confirmed by a higher  resolution study of this phenomena described in section [ hot ] , which reveals that additional trapping also occurs at a number of exotic mean motion resonances like the 11:6 , 13:7 , 13:6 , 9:4 , 7:3 , 12:5 , 8:3 , 3:1 , 7:2 , and the 4:1 ; such resonances are not populated when neptune migrates into a dynamically cold disk .",
    "not surprisingly , neptune s migration into a previously stirred  up kuiper belt also accounts for the eccentricities of @xmath72 observed in the main belt .",
    "* however the planet  migration scenario investigated here does not account for the observed kbos having inclinations above @xmath100 ( section [ i ] ) , which is the main deficiency of this model .",
    "this is a serious discrepancy since half of all kbos have inclinations @xmath381 according to the debiased inclination distribution reported by @xcite . *",
    "neptune s migration into a stirred  up kuiper belt traps particles in eccentric orbits at a number of resonances beyond @xmath206 au , the most prominent of these being the 5:2 and the 3:1 .",
    "many of these distant particles that are trapped at semimajor axes @xmath9 au also have perihelia @xmath79 au , which is the domain conventionally known as the scattered disk . however section [ hot ] shows that only about 10% of the simulated particles that inhabit the",

    "another curious feature of the 3:2 is its lower than expected abundance ( relative to the main belt kbos ) of fainter kbos having magnitudes @xmath384 .",
    "section [ census ] shows that this dearth of fainter kbos at the 3:2 can be interpreted as a dearth of small bodies , which implies that the 3:2 population has a @xmath385 size distribution that is substantially shallower than the canonical @xmath169 power  law that holds for the larger members of the main belt .",
    "* the simulated centaurs are quite sparse owing to their short dynamical lifetimes ; only seven centaurs were detected in the simulation during its final 2 gyrs .",

    "the cumulative luminosity function for class @xmath422 can be written as @xmath437 where @xmath438 is the kuiper belt s total solid angle , and @xmath439 is the cumulative magnitude distribution for class @xmath422 , _ ie , _ the total number of kbos in class @xmath422 that are brighter than magnitude @xmath129 .",
    "thus @xmath440 since a body s magnitude @xmath129 is a function of its radius @xmath108 via eqn .",
    "( [ mr ] ) , for which @xmath441 is the differential size distribution for class @xmath422 which has a total of @xmath442 bodies having radii in the interval @xmath443 ( see eqn .",
    "[ n(r ) ] ) . and",
    "since @xmath444 ( see eqn .",
    "[ mr ] ) , the differential luminosity function can be written @xmath445 thus if any two kbo classes @xmath422 and @xmath433 have the same size distribution @xmath183 , then the ratio of their observed abundances is simply @xmath446 in other words , the ratio of the observed abundance of any two classes of kbos is approximately equal to the ratio of their intrinsic abundances , provided all bodies have the same size distribution @xmath183 .",
    "but if populations @xmath422 and @xmath433 have different size distributions , then @xmath447 will vary with @xmath129 ( see section [ census ] ) .      the monte carlo model of section [ census",
    "] replicates each nbody survivor seen in fig .",
    "[ hot belt ] @xmath13 times by randomizing the particles mean anomalies , which results in a model kuiper belt having azimuthal symmetry .",
    "thus the model implicitly assumes that the kuiper belt has this same symmetry .",
    "however one might question this assumption , since it is well known that a planet s resonant perturbations can rearrange the longitudes of a small body population .",
    "for instance , particles at neptune s 3:2 tend to approach perihelion at longitudes that are @xmath448 away from the planet @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in the upper left corner of fig .",
    "[ longitudes ] , which shows the ecliptic coordinates of all simulated particles that are in or very near neptune s 3:2 resonance .",
    "this figure shows that neptune tends to arrange the 3:2 bodies preferentially away from the sun ",
    "neptune line , causing regions that lead / trail neptune by @xmath449 to be more densely populated , termed ` sweet spots ' in @xcite .",
    "figure [ longitudes ] shows that resonant shepherding also occurs at neptune s 2:1 , again similar to that seen in @xcite .",
    "red dots indicate the positions of the multi ",
    "opposition kbos considered here , which shows that kbos in or near the 3:2 resonance tend to be discovered at longitudes that are roughly @xmath449 away from neptune , as expected .",
    "it is thus possible that neptune s rearrangement of the belt might skew our estimate of the resonant populations .",
    "if , for example , kbo astronomers were preferentially surveying the belt along longitudes that are @xmath449 away from neptune , they would detect a rather high sky ",
    "plane number density of kbos in the 3:2 .",
    "if we then assumed that this 3:2 number density were uniform about the entire ecliptic , we would overestimate the total 3:2 population .",
    "similarly , if astronomers systematically observed the belt towards neptune or @xmath450 away , we would underestimate the 3:2 s average sky  plane density and undercount its total population .",
    "but if astronomers surveyed all longitudes with equal frequency , then these competing effects  due to neptune pushing kbos away from certain longitudes and towards other longitudes  should wash out , resulting in an estimate of the 3:2 population that is approximately reliable .    the upper right part of fig .",
    "[ longitudes ] shows the ecliptic coordinates of the observed multi  opposition main belt kbos .",
    "since the main belt population is likely azimuthally symmetric , these red dots should be a good indicator of where astronomers are looking for kbos .",
    "it is quite clear from this figure that these astronomers lines  of  sight are not distributed uniformly about the ecliptic .",
    "for instance , these kbo hunters tend to avoid the galactic plane , which passes through the ecliptic along the dashed line .",
    "the mb figure also shows that astronomers have avoided a narrow portion of the 3:2 s ` sweet spot ' that leads neptune by about @xmath451 .",
    "but it is also quite clear that these same astronomers are not systematically staring at the 3:2 s sweet spots , nor are they systematically avoiding them .",
    "consequently , our simple visual inspection of this kbo sample indicates that our estimate of the 3:2 population will not be significantly baised towards under or overcounting the 3:2 population , and that the 3:2 abundance reported in section [ calibration ] is indeed representative .",
    "a similar conclusion is also drawn for the much sparser 2:1 population .    of course , this treatment succeeds only if the monte carlo method of section [ census ] does not alter the particles radial distribution as they have their mean anomalies randomized by the replication process .",
    "however it is straighforward to show that this is indeed the case .",
    "for instance , randomizing the mean anomalies of the 3:2 population seen fig .",
    "[ longitudes ] does not change their radial distribution in any significant way .                                                                      ,  .",
