    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation has played an essential role in shaping our current understanding of the large - scale properties of the universe .",
    "the discovery of this radiation in 1965 by penzias and wilson  @xcite , and its subsequent interpretation as the relic radiation from a hot , dense phase of the universe  @xcite put the hot big bang model on a firm observational footing .",
    "the prediction of angular variations in the temperature of the radiation , due to the propagation of photons through an inhomogeneous universe , followed shortly after  @xcite , but it was not until 1992 that these were finally detected by the differential microwave radiometers ( dmr ) experiment on the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) satellite  @xcite .",
    "the fractional temperature anisotropies are at the level of @xmath1 , consistent with structure formation in cold dark matter ( cdm ) models  @xcite , but much smaller than earlier predictions for baryon - dominated universes  @xcite .",
    "another experiment on cobe , the far infrared absolute spectrophotometer ( firas ) , spectacularly confirmed the black - body spectrum of the cmb and determined the ( isotropic ) temperature to be 2.725k  @xcite .    in the period since cobe , many experiments have mapped the cmb anisotropies on a range of angular scales from degrees to arcminutes ( see @xcite for a recent review ) , culminating in the first - year release of all - sky data from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) satellite in february 2003  @xcite .",
    "the observed modulation in the amplitude of the anisotropies with angular scale is fully consistent with predictions based on coherent , acoustic oscillations  @xcite , derived from gravitational instability of initially adiabatic density perturbations in a universe with nearly - flat spatial sections .",
    "the amplitude and scale of these acoustic features has allowed many of the key cosmological parameters to be determined with unprecedented precision  @xcite , and a strong concordance with other cosmological probes has emerged .    in this review",
    "we describe the essential physics of the temperature anisotropies of the cmb , and its recently - detected polarization  @xcite , and discuss how these are used to constrain cosmological models . for reviews that are similar in spirit , but from the pre - wmap era see e.g.  @xcite .",

    ". section  [ adc : sec : params ] discusses the effect of cosmological parameters on the power spectrum of the temperature anisotropies , and the limits to parameter determination from the cmb alone .",
    "the physics of cmb polarization is reviewed in sect .",
    "[ adc : sec : pol ] , and the additional information that polarization brings over temperature anisotropies alone is considered . finally , in sect .",
    "[ adc : sec : highlights ] we describe some of the scientific highlights that have emerged from recent cmb observations , including the detection of cmb polarization , implications for inflation , and the direct signature of dark - energy through correlations between the large - scale anisotropies and tracers of the mass distribution in the local universe . throughout",
    ", we illustrate our discussion with computations based on @xmath2cdm cosmologies , with baryon density @xmath3 and cold dark matter density @xmath4 . for flat models",
    "we take the dark - energy density parameter to be @xmath5 giving a hubble parameter @xmath6 .",
    "we adopt units with @xmath7 throughout , and use a spacetime metric signature @xmath8 .",
    "in this section we aim to give a reasonably self - contained review of the essential elements of cmb physics .      the high temperature of the early universe maintained a low equilibrium fraction of neutral atoms , and a correspondingly high number density of free electrons .",
    "coulomb scattering between the ions and electrons kept them in local kinetic equilibrium , and thomson scattering of photons tended to maintain the isotropy of the cmb in the baryon rest frame .",
    "as the universe expanded and cooled , the dominant element hydrogen started to recombine when the temperature fell below @xmath9 4000k  a factor of 40 lower than might be anticipated from the 13.6-ev inoization potential of hydrogen , due to the large ratio of the number of photons to baryons .",
    "the details of recombination are complicated since the processes that give rise to net recombination occur too slowly to maintain chemical equilibrium between the electrons , protons and atoms during the later stages of recombination  @xcite ( see  @xcite for recent refinements ) .",
    "the most important quantity for cmb anisotropy formation is the visibility function  the probability that a photon last scattered as a function of time .",
    "the visibility function peaks around @xmath10 after the big bang , and has a width @xmath11 , a small fraction of the current age @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "after recombination , photons travelled mostly unimpeded through the inhomogeneous universe , imprinting fluctuations in the radiation temperature , the gravitational potentials , and the bulk velocity of the radiation where they last scattered , as the temperature anisotropies that we observe today . a small fraction of cmb photons ( current results from cmb polarization measurements  @xcite indicate around 20 per cent ; see also sect .  [ adc : subsec : polhighlights ] ) underwent further scattering once the universe reionized due to to the ionizing flux from the first non - linear structures .",
    "the spectrum of the cmb brightness along any direction @xmath13 is very nearly thermal with a temperature @xmath14 .",
    "the temperature depends only weakly on direction , with fluctuations @xmath15 at the level of @xmath1 of the average temperature @xmath16k .",
    "it is convenient to expand the temperature fluctuation in spherical harmonics , @xmath17 with @xmath18 since the temperature is a real field .",
    "the sum in ( [ adc : eq1 ] ) runs over @xmath19 , but the dipole ( @xmath20 ) is usually removed explicitly when analysing data since it depends linearly on the velocity of the observer .",
    "multipoles at @xmath21 encode spatial information with characteristic angular scale @xmath22 .",
    "the statistical properties of the fluctuations in a perturbed cosmology can be expected to respect the symmetries of the background model . in the case of robertson ",
    "walker models , the rotational symmetry of the background ensures that the multipoles @xmath23 are uncorrelated for different values of @xmath21 and @xmath24 : @xmath25 which defines the power spectrum @xmath26 .",
    "the angle brackets in this equation denote the average over an ensemble of realisations of the fluctuations .",
    "the simplest models of inflation predict that the fluctuations should also be gaussian at early times , and this is preserved by linear evolution of the small fluctuations .",
    "if gaussian , the @xmath23s are also independent , and the power spectrum provides the complete statistical description of the temperature anisotropies . for this reason , measuring the anisotropy power spectrum has , so far , been the main goal of observational cmb research .",
    "temperature anisotropies have now been detected up to @xmath21 of a few thousand ; a recent compilation of current data as of february 2004 is given in fig .",
    "[ adc : fig1 ] .",
    "the correlation between the temperature anisotropies along two directions evaluates to @xmath27 which depends only on the angular separation @xmath28 as required by rotational invariance . here , @xmath29 are the legendre polynomials .",
    "the mean - square temperature anisotropy is @xmath30 so that the quantity @xmath31 , which is conventionally plotted , is approximately the power per decade in @xmath21 of the temperature anisotropies .",
    "the cmb photons can be described by a one - particle distribution function @xmath32 that is a function of the spacetime position @xmath33 and four - momentum @xmath34 of the photon .",
    "it is defined such that the number of photons contained in a proper three - volume element @xmath35 and with three - momentum in @xmath36 is @xmath37 .",
    "the phase - space volume element @xmath38 is lorentz - invariant and is conserved along the photon path through phase space ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath39 is also frame - invariant , and is conserved in the absence of scattering . to calculate the anisotropies in the cmb temperature",
    ", we must evolve the photon distribution function in the perturbed universe .    to avoid over - complicating our discussion",
    ", we shall only consider spatially - flat models here , and , for the moment , ignore the effects of polarization .",
    "for a more complete discussion , including these complications , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "curvature mostly affects the cmb through the geometrical projection of linear scales at last scattering to angular scales on the sky today , but has a negligible impact on pre - recombination physics and hence much of the discussion in this section .",
    "the subject of cosmological perturbation theory is rich in methodology , but , for pedagogical reasons , we adopt here the most straightforward approach which is to work directly with the metric perturbations .",
    "this is also the most prevalent in the cmb literature .",
    "the 1 + 3-covariant approach  @xcite is a well - developed alternative that is arguably more physically - transparent than metric - based techniques .",
    "it has also been applied extensively in the context of cmb physics  @xcite .",
    "the majority of our discussion will be of scalar perturbations , where all perturbed three - tensors can be derived from the spatial derivatives of scalar functions , although we discuss tensor perturbations briefly in sect .",

    "we see immediately that @xmath56 is conserved in the absence of perturbations , so that the energy redshifts in proportion to the scale factor in the background model .",
    "the change in direction of the photon due to the projected gradient of the potentials in the perturbed universe gives rise to gravitational lensing ( see e.g.  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the dominant scattering mechanism to affect cmb anisotropies is classical thomson scattering off free electrons , since around recombination the average photon energy is small compared to the rest mass of the electron .",
    "furthermore , the thermal distribution of electron velocities can be ignored due to the low temperature .",

    "the first term on the right of ( [ adc : eq9 ] ) describes scattering out of the beam , and the second scattering into the beam .",

    "is isotropic and the net scattering term vanishes , so that @xmath39 is a function of the conserved @xmath56 only : @xmath62 .",

    "finally , there is an additional gravitational redshift contribution arising from evolution of the gravitational potentials  @xcite .",
    "an accurate calculation of the cmb anisotropy on all scales where linear perturbation theory is valid requires a full numerical solution of the boltzmann equation .",
    "the starting point is to expand @xmath78 in appropriate basis functions . for scalar perturbations , these are the contraction of the ( irreducible ) trace - free tensor products @xmath79 ( the angle brackets denoting the trace - free part ) with trace - free ( spatial ) tensors derived from derivatives of scalars  @xcite .",

    "careful treatment of the truncation of the hierarchy is necessary to avoid unphysical reflection of power back down through the moments .",

    "the integral approach is thus significantly faster than a direct solution of the hierarchy .",

    ", observations are beginning to place interesting constraints on specific models of inflation in the @xmath292@xmath290 plane  @xcite .",
    "already , large - field models with power - law potentials steeper than @xmath293 are ruled out due to their red scalar spectra and comparatively large tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "future programmes targeting @xmath263-mode polarization may ultimately be able to detect gravitational waves down to an inflationary energy scale of a @xmath294 .",
    "such observations will sharpen constraints in the @xmath292@xmath290 plane considerably , and should allow fine selection amongst the many proposed models of inflation .",
    "the late - time isw effect arises from the decay of the gravitational potentials once the universe becomes dark - energy dominated , and so should produce large - angle ( positive ) correlations between the cmb temperature anisotropies and other tracers of the potential in the local universe . with the advent of the wmap data ,",
    "a number of groups have reported the detection of such a correlation . in  @xcite",
    ", wmap data was cross - correlated with data on the hard x - ray background ( which is dominated by emission from active galaxies ) from the heao-1 satellite , and the number density of radio sources from the nvss catalogue . in each case",
    "a positive correlation was detected at significance @xmath295 and @xmath296 respectively .",
    "the correlation with nvss has also been carried out independently by the wmap team  @xcite , who also note that the observed positive correlation can be used to rule out the closed , @xmath297 model model that is a good fit to the cmb data in isolation ( see fig .",
    "[ adc : fig11 ] ) .",
    "several groups have now also detected the cross - correlation on large scales between the cmb and optical galaxy surveys , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the linear anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background have been studied theoretically for over three decades .",
    "the physics , which is now well understood , employs linearised radiative transfer , general relativity , and hydrodynamics to describe the propagation of cmb photons and the evolution of the fluid constituents in a perturbed friedmann - robertson - walker universe .",
    "a number of bold predictions have emerged from this theoretical activity , most notably the existence of acoustic peaks in the anisotropy power spectrum due to oscillations in the photon  baryon plasma prior to recombination .",
    "observers have risen to the challenge of verifying these predictions , and their detection is proceeding at a staggering rate . the large - scale sachs ",
    "wolfe effect , acoustic peak structure , damping tail , late - time integrated sachs ",
    "wolfe effect , polarization and reionization signature have all been detected , and the first three have been measured in considerable detail .",
    "already , the size and scale of these effects is allowing cosmological models to be constrained with unprecedented precision .",
    "the results are beautifully consistent with almost - scale - invariant adiabatic initial conditions evolving passively in a spatially flat , @xmath2cdm universe .",
    "much work still remains to be done to exploit fully the information contained in the cmb anisotropies .",
    "the planck satellite , due for launch in 2007 , should provide definitive mapping of the linear cmb anisotropies , and a cosmic - variance limited measurement of the power spectrum up to multipoles @xmath298 .",
    "this dataset will be invaluable in assessing many of the issues hinted at in the first - year release of wmap data , such as the apparent lack of power on large scales and possible violations of rotational ( statistical ) invariance .",
    "prior to planck , a number of ground - based programmes should shed further light on the issue of whether departures from a power - law primordial spectrum are required on cosmological scales , and the implications of this for slow - roll inflation .",
    "in addition , these small - scale observations will start to explore the rich science of secondary anisotropies , due to e.g.scattering in hot clusters  @xcite or bulk flows modulated by variations in the electron density in the reionized universe  @xcite , and the weak lensing effect of large - scale structure  @xcite .",
    "detections of cmb polarization are in their infancy , but we can expect rapid progress on this front too .",
    "accurate measurements of the power spectra of @xmath72-mode polarization , and its correlation with the temperature anisotropies , can be expected from a number of ground and balloon - borne experiments , as well as from planck .",
    "the ultimate goal for cmb polarimetry is to detect the @xmath263-mode signal predicted from gravitational waves .",
    "this would give a direct measure of the energy scale of inflation , and , when combined with measurements of the spectrum density perturbations , place tight constraints on the dynamics of inflation .",
    "plans are already being made for a new generation of polarimeters with the large numbers of detectors and exquisite control of instrument systematics needed to detect the gravity - wave signal if the energy scale of inflation is around @xmath299 .",
    "ultimately , confusion due to imperfect subtraction of astrophysical foregrounds and the effects of weak lensing on the polarization limit will limit the energy scales that we can probe with cmb polarization ; see  @xcite and references therein .",
