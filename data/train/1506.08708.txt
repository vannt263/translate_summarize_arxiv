    "in this paper we give a theory for multivariate orthogonal laurent polynomials in the unit torus ( mvolput ) .",
    "our motivation comes from our previous work in orthogonal polynomials in the unit circle ( olpuc ) @xcite , its matrix extension @xcite and our recent developments on multivariate orthogonal polynomials in real spaces ( mvopr ) @xcite .",
    "the natural framework for the study of the ring of laurent polynomials in several variables is the algebraic torus @xmath0 , @xmath3 .",
    "the orthogonal elements appear once a borel measure @xmath4 with support in the @xmath5-dimensional unit torus @xmath1 , @xmath6 , is considered .",
    "inspired by the cantero ",
    "velquez ( cmv ) approach @xcite , se also @xcite , we propose an order for the multivariate laurent polynomials in the algebraic torus @xmath0 .",
    "for the mvolput we find in this paper not only three - term relations and christoffel  darboux formul , but also construct associated second kind functions and partial second kind functions given in terms of the fourier series of the measure and cauchy integral transforms , all connected through plemej relations .",
    "remarkably , we are able to find the extension of the christoffel formula for laurent polynomial perturbations of the measure in terms of a last quasideterminant of a bordered sample matrix constructed from the original mvolput evaluated at a poised set in the algebraic hypersurface of the zeroes of the laurent polynomial generating the perturbation . as the chosen order does not generate any gradation , for the finding of poised sets we need of what we have called nice laurent polynomials .",
    "the discussion requires of mathematical ideas connected with tropical geometry as newton polytopes and also of elementary algebraic geometry . finally , we are able to construct toda integrable systems of discrete and continuos type and also find how the kadomtsev ",
    "petviashvilli flows live in each site of the toda lattice .    for a better understanding of the results achieved and its context let us perform some preliminary comments on the state of the art of the subjects involved .",
    "the unit circle @xmath7 is the border of the unit disk @xmath8 .",
    "a complex borel measure @xmath9 supported in @xmath7 is said to be positive definite if it maps measurable sets into non - negative numbers , that in the absolutely continuous situation ( with respect to the lebesgue  haar measure @xmath10 ) has the form @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "for the positive definite situation the orthogonal polynomials in the unit circle ( opuc ) or szeg polynomials are defined as the monic polynomials @xmath13 of degree @xmath14 that satisfy the orthogonality relations , @xmath15 , for @xmath16 , @xcite .",
    "orthogonal polynomials on the real line ( oprl ) with support on @xmath17 $ ] are connected with opuc @xcite . in the real case",
    "the three - term relations provide a tridiagonal matrix , the so called jacobi operator , while in the unit circle support case the problem leads to a hessenberg matrix .",
    "opuc s recursion relation is given in terms of reverse szeg polynomials @xmath18 and reflection or verblunsky coefficients @xmath19 .",
    "the recursion relations for the szeg o polynomials can be written as @xmath20 .",
    "szeg s theorem implies for a nontrivial probability measure @xmath4 on @xmath7 with verblunsky coefficients @xmath21 that the corresponding szeg s polynomials are dense in @xmath22 if and only if @xmath23 . for an absolutely continuous probability measure kolmogorov",
    "s density theorem ensures that density in @xmath22 of the opuc holds if and only if the so called szeg s condition @xmath24 is fulfilled , @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to barry simon s books @xcite and @xcite for a very detailed studied of opuc .      in the context of the strong stieltjes moment problem",
    "the papers @xcite could be considered as the seed for the study of orthogonal laurent polynomials on the real line ( olprl ) .",
    "whenever we have solution of the moment problem we have laurent polynomials @xmath25 that fulfill the orthogonality conditions @xmath26 for @xmath27 . for the early development of the theory see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the circle @xmath7 context was first considered in @xcite , see also @xcite where matters like recursion relations , favard s theorem , quadrature problems , and christoffel  darboux formul were treated .",
    "the cmv @xcite representation is a hallmark in the study of certain aspects of szeg polynomials . indeed , despite the set of olpuc being dense in @xmath22 in general this is not true for the opuc , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "now , the recursion relations for ordinary szeg polynomials and its reverse polynomials is replaced by a five - term relation similar to the oprl situation .",
    "alternative or generic orders in the base used to span the space of olpuc can be found in @xcite .",
    "other papers have reviewed and broadened the study of cmv matrices , see for example @xcite .",
    "as was pointed out in @xcite the discovery of the advantages of the cmv ordering goes back to previous work @xcite .",
    "the monographs @xcite and @xcite are highly recommend references for understanding the state of the art regarding multivariate orthogonal polynomials .",
    "the recurrence relation for orthogonal polynomials in several variables was studied by xu in @xcite , while in @xcite he linked multivariate orthogonal polynomials with a commutative family of self - adjoint operators and the spectral theorem was used to show the existence of a three - term relation for the orthogonal polynomials .",
    "he discusses in @xcite how the three - term relation leads to the construction of multivariate orthogonal polynomials and cubature formul . the analysis of orthogonal polynomials and cubature formul on the unit ball , the standard simplex , and the unit sphere @xcite lead to conclude the strong connection of orthogonal structures and cubature formul for these three regions .",
    "the paper @xcite presents a systematic study of the common zeros of polynomials in several variables which are related to higher dimensional quadrature .",
    "karlin and mcgregor @xcite and milch @xcite discussed interesting examples of multivariate hahn and krawtchouk polynomials related to growth birth and death processes .",
    "there have been substantial developments since 1975 , for instance , the spectral properties of these multivariate hahn and krawtchouk polynomials have been studied in @xcite . in @xcite a two - variable positive extension problem for trigonometric polynomials was discussed here the extension is required to be the reciprocal of the absolute value squared of a stable polynomial .",
    "this could be understood as an autoregressive filter design problem for bivariate stochastic processes .",
    "the authors show that the existence of a solution is equivalent to solving a finite positive definite matrix completion problem where the completion is required to satisfy an additional low rank condition . as a corollary of the main result a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a spectral fejr ",
    "riesz factorization of a strictly positive two - variable trigonometric polynomial is given in terms of the fourier coefficients of its reciprocal .",
    "a spectral matching result is obtained , as well as inverse formulas for doubly - indexed toeplitz matrices .",
    "geronimo and woerdeman used tools including a specific two - variable kronecker theorem based on certain elements from algebraic geometry , as well as a two - variable christoffel  darboux like formula . in @xcite reproducing kernels are used to give and alternative proofs for some of the mentioned results on orthogonal polynomials on the two dimensional torus ( and related subjects ) . regarding extension problems on the torus and moment matrices",
    "see @xcite . in @xcite a formula describing the asymptotics of a class of multivariate orthogonal polynomials with hyperoctahedral symmetry as the degree tends to infinity is given .",
    "the polynomials under consideration are characterized by a factorized weight function satisfying certain analyticity assumptions .      in the context of the sturm ",
    "liouville theory , gaston darboux @xcite introduced these transformations for the first time . much later",
    "@xcite this transformation was named after darboux .",
    "it has been extensively developed for orthogonal polynomials @xcite . in geometry , the theory of transformations of surfaces preserving some given properties conforms a classical subject , in the list of such transformations given in the classical treatise by einsehart @xcite we find the lvy ( named after lucien lvy ) transformation @xcite , which later on was named as elementary darboux transformation and known in the orthogonal polynomials context as christoffel transformation @xcite .",
    "the adjoint elementary darboux or adjoint lvy transformation is also relevant @xcite and is referred some times as a geronimus transformation @xcite .",
    "finally the rational uvarov transformation corresponds to the fundamental transformation introduced in a geometrical context by hans jonas @xcite , see also the discussion in @xcite . for further information",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the iteration formula of christoffel transformations is due to elwin bruno christoffel @xcite .",
    "this fact was rediscovered much latter in the toda context , see for example the formula ( 5.1.11 ) in @xcite for @xmath28 .",
    "the papers @xcite and @xcite settled the lie group theoretical description of integrable hierarchies . see @xcite for a discussion of the role of the factorization problems , dressing procedure , and linear systems as the keys for integrability .",
    "in this dressing setting the multicomponent integrable hierarchies of toda type were analyzed in @xcite .",
    "for further developments see @xcite and @xcite for the multi - component kp hierarchy and @xcite for the multi - component toda lattice hierarchy .",
    "mark adler and pierre van moerbeke showed how the gauss  borel factorization problem appears in the theory of the 2d toda hierarchy and what they called the discrete kp hierarchy @xcite .",
    "these papers clearly established from a group - theoretical setup why standard orthogonality of polynomials and integrability of nonlinear equations of toda type where so close . in fact , the gauss  borel factorization of the moment matrix may be understood as the gauss  borel factorization of the initial condition for the integrable hierarchy .      in the madrid group , based on the gauss  borel factorization ,",
    "we have been searching further the deep links between the theory of orthogonal polynomials and the theory of integrable systems .",
    "in @xcite we studied the generalized orthogonal polynomials @xcite and its matrix extensions from the gauss  borel view point .",
    "in @xcite we gave a complete study in terms of this factorization for multiple orthogonal polynomials of mixed type and characterized the integrable systems associated to them .",
    "then , we studied laurent orthogonal polynomials in the unit circle trough the cmv approach in @xcite and found in @xcite the christoffel  darboux formula for generalized orthogonal matrix polynomials . these methods",
    "where further extended , for example we gave an alternative christoffel ",
    "darboux formula for mixed multiple orthogonal polynomials @xcite or developed the corresponding theory of matrix laurent orthogonal polynomials in the unit circle and its associated toda type hierarchy @xcite .",
    "in  2 , for a borel measure in the unit torus this monomial ordering induces an arranging of the moments in a moment matrix , built up of growing size rectangular blocks , as it happens for mvopr @xcite , this moment matrix has a rich structure having therefore several important properties . in the quasi - definite case the gauss  borel factorization of this matrix gives multivariate biorthogonal laurent polynomials in the unit torus and to mvolput for positive measures .",
    "we define second kind functions that are shown to be a product of the mvolput and the fourier series of the measure .",
    "the moment matrix has persymmetries and partial persymmetries which happen to be useful for the finding of plemej type formulae for the orthogonal laurent polynomials .",
    "then , another symmetry of the moment matrix , which we call string equation , leads to three - term relations and christoffel  darboux formul .",
    "we study in  3 laurent polynomial perturbations of the measure , which could be considered as an extension of the christoffel transformation to this framework .",
    "interpolation theory and the construction of appropriate sample matrices based on poised sets allows for the construction of the christoffel formula in this generalized scenario . to construct poised sets we need of what we call nice laurent polynomials , which behave nicely with the extended cmv ordering .",
    "we study nice laurent polynomials with the aid of newton polytopes , and some aspects of tropical geometry .",
    "full column rank laurent ",
    "vandermonde matrices and algebraic geometry lead to poised sets in this context .",
    "these darboux transformations are studied for the lebesgue  haar measure .",
    "perturbed christoffel ",
    "darboux kernels and connection formul for the perturbed and non perturbed kernels are given    finally , in  4 we introduce integrable systems of toda and kadomtsev  petviasvilii ( kp ) type .",
    "in particular we show how discrete toda type flows appear and give miwa type expressions for the orthogonal laurent polynomials .",
    "a toda type integrable hierarchy is found , and baker functions , lax matrices and zakharov  sahabat equations are discussed .",
    "we also find bilinear equations , miwa shifts and corresponding vertex operators .",
