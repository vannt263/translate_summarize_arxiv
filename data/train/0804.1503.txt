    "the question whether stably rational varieties are always rational is the well - known zariski problem which beauville , colliot - thlne , sansuc and swinnerton - dyer @xcite answered in the negative as well : there are three - dimensional conic bundles @xmath5 over rational surfaces which are irrational , but @xmath6 is rational .",

    "+ the main theorem of the present article is     [ tmain ] the moduli space of plane curves of sufficiently large degree @xmath27 under projective equivalence is rational .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath28 , @xmath20 , this was proven by katsylo @xcite as a glance back at the preceding summary shows .",
    "we use this result and do nt improve the bound for @xmath0 . for @xmath14 ( mod @xmath19 )",
    ", we obtain rationality for @xmath29 . for @xmath30 ( mod@xmath19 ) , we need @xmath31 .",
    "let us turn to some open problems .",
    "first of all , the method used in this paper seems to generalize and -provided the required genericity properties hold and can be verified computationally- could yield a proof of the rationality of @xmath9 for _ fixed _",
    "@xmath32 if the degree @xmath0 is large enough and @xmath33 does not divide @xmath0 .",
    "the latter case might be amenable to the techniques of @xcite in general .",
    "thus the case of the moduli spaces of surfaces of degree @xmath0 in @xmath34 seems now tractable with some diligence and effort .",
    "but we do not see how one could obtain results on @xmath35 _ for all _ @xmath32 ( and @xmath0 sufficiently large compared to @xmath32 ) .",
    "more importantly , whereas we think that it is highly plausible that @xmath36 is always rational if @xmath0 is sufficiently large compared to @xmath32 , we do not want to hazard any guess in the case where @xmath0 is small .",
    "in fact , we do not know any truely convincing philosophical reason why @xmath36 should be rational in general ; the present techniques of proving rationality always seem to force one into assuming that @xmath0 is sufficiently large if one wants to obtain an infinite series of rational examples by a uniform method",
    ". moreover , it can be quite painstaking and tricky to get a hold of the situation if @xmath0 is small as katsylo s tour de force proof for @xmath37 ( i.e. @xmath38 ) in @xcite , @xcite amply illustrates .",
    "the maybe easiest unsolved cases are @xmath39 ( plane sextics ) and @xmath40 ( quartic surfaces ) .",
    "note that the former space is birational to the moduli space of polarized k3 surfaces @xmath41 of degree @xmath42 ( thus @xmath43 is a nonsingular projective k3 surface and @xmath44 is the class of an ample divisor with @xmath45 ) , and the latter space is birational to the moduli space of polarized k3 surfaces of degree @xmath15 .    we would like to thank fedor bogomolov and yuri tschinkel for suggesting this problem and helpful discussions .",
    "the structural pattern of the proof is similar to @xcite ; there the so called _ method of covariants _ is introduced , and we learnt a lot from studying that source .",
    "+ we fiber the space @xmath46 of degree @xmath0 plane curves over the space of plane quartics , if @xmath47 ( mod @xmath19 ) , and over the space of plane octics , if @xmath48 ( mod @xmath19 ) , i.e. we construct @xmath49-equivariant maps @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 coincides with the covariant used in @xcite for the case @xmath53 ) .",
    "these maps are of degree @xmath15 as polynomials in the coordinates on the source spaces , i.e. of degree @xmath15 in the curve coefficients .",
    "they are constructed via the symbolic method recalled in section 3 .",
    "furthermore they induce _ dominant _ rational maps on the associated projective spaces .",
    "we remark here that the properties of @xmath52 and @xmath54 essential for the proof are that they are of fixed low degree in the curve coefficients , take values in spaces of curves of fixed low degree , and are sufficiently generic .",
    "we now focus on the case @xmath14 ( mod @xmath19 ) .",
    "the proof has three main steps :    * @xmath55 is stably rational , more precisely its product with @xmath56 is rational ; cf .",
    "@xcite , theorem 1.1 for this .",
    "* we find a linear subspace @xmath57 such that @xmath58 is contained in the base locus @xmath59 of @xmath52 with a full triple structure , i.e. @xmath60 , and consider the projection @xmath61 away from @xmath62 onto @xmath63 . we show that a general fibre of @xmath52 is birationally a vector bundle over a rational base . *",
    "the quotient map @xmath64 has a section @xmath65 . pulling back the linear fibrations constructed in @xmath66 via @xmath65",
    "we show that the moduli space of plane curves of degree @xmath0 is birational to @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is large , whence we conclude by ( 1 ) .",
    "the main computational difficulty occurs in ( 2 ) where we have to establish that @xmath69 is sufficiently generic .",
    "projecting from @xmath58 we obtain a diagram    we show that    * for a particular ( hence a general ) @xmath70 the map @xmath71 is surjective .",
    "note that @xmath72 is linear since @xmath69 is contained in the base locus with full triple structure and @xmath52 is of degree @xmath15 in the curve coefficients .",
    "it is therefore enough to explicitly construct points in the image that span @xmath73 . from this",
    "it follows at once that a general fibre of @xmath52 is mapped dominantly by @xmath61 whence we may view such a fibre birationally as a vector bundle over a rational base . to understand better why the dominance of @xmath52 is not sufficient here , it is instructive to keep the following example in mind :    .,width=226 ]    consider the rational map @xmath74 where @xmath75 are quadric cones with vertex @xmath76",
    "@xmath43 is dominant .",
    "projection from the vertex @xmath76 to @xmath77 is also dominant , but the quadric cones ( i.e. the fibers of @xmath52 ) do not map dominantly to @xmath77 ( see figure [ fexample ] ) .",
    "the projection fibers are the lines through @xmath76 and indeed each such line is contained completely in one cone in the pencil @xmath78 .",
    "the base locus @xmath79 of @xmath43 consists of @xmath15 lines that meet in @xmath76 .",
    "if on the other hand we project from a smooth point @xmath80 then a general fiber of @xmath43 maps dominantly to @xmath77 . indeed a general line through @xmath81 intersects all cones .    the complications in proving ( @xmath82 arise due to the fact that the natural description of @xmath69 is in terms of the _ monomials _ which span it , whereas @xmath52 can be most easily evaluated on forms which are written _ as sums of powers of linear forms_. these two points of view do not match , and we can not repose on methods in @xcite . instead we introduce new techniques in section [ sfiberwise ] to solve this difficulty :    * we use _ interpolation polynomials _ to write down elements in @xmath69 as _ sums of powers of linear forms_. * next we employ considerations of _ leading terms _ ( or , geometrically , jets at infinity ) to eliminate the interpolation polynomials , from our formulae . * for large enough @xmath83 ,",
    "we finally reduce ( 4 ) to the property that a certain matrix @xmath84 has full rank .",
    "the size of @xmath84 is independent of @xmath32 while ( _ and this is the main point _ ) its entries are of the form @xmath85 where @xmath86 are polynomials of fixed degree ( i.e. independent of @xmath32 ) , @xmath87 are constants , and the number of summands in the expression is independent of @xmath32 .",
    "this is possible only because we eliminated the interpolation polynomials in the previous step . * by choosing a point @xmath88 with integer coefficients we can arrange that @xmath87 and @xmath89 are defined over @xmath90 with denominators that are not divisible by a small prime @xmath91 which we call the precision of our calculation . thus if we work over _ the finite field _",
    "@xmath92 , the matrix @xmath84 is periodic in @xmath32 with period @xmath93 .",
    "a computer algebra program is then used to check that these matrices all have full rank . by semicontinuity",
    ", this proves that @xmath84 has full rank for all @xmath32 in characteristic @xmath94 .    in a rather round - about sense ,",
    "we have also been guided by the principle that _ evaluation of a polynomial _ at a special point can be much cheaper than _ computing the polynomial_.",
    "for definiteness , the base field will be @xmath95 , the field of complex numbers , though one might replace it by any algebraically closed field of characteristic @xmath94 throughout .",
    "+ let @xmath96 , and let @xmath97 be the adjoint form of @xmath3 .",
    "we denote by @xmath98 the irreducible @xmath3-representation @xmath99 .",
    "we fix a positive integer @xmath0 not divisible by @xmath19 , @xmath83 or @xmath100 , @xmath101 .",

    "we will use schwartz s multi - index notation and denote multi - indices by lower case boldface letters .",
    "thus we write a general homogeneous form @xmath108 of degree @xmath0 as @xmath109 ^ 3}{| \\mathbf{i } | = d } } \\frac{d ! } { \\mathbf{i } ! } a_{\\mathbf{i } } \\mathbf{x}^{\\mathbf{i}}\\ , , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "we will use the symbolical method introduced by aronhold and clebsch to write down @xmath3-equivariant maps ( covariants ) from @xmath114 to @xmath115 ( if @xmath83 ) or to @xmath116 ( if @xmath100 ) .",
    "it is explained in @xcite and , from a modern point of view , in @xcite , chapter 1 .",
    "we denote by @xmath117 a vector of symbolic variables , and also introduce vectors @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , similarly .",
    "we write @xmath121 , and similarly @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 .",
    "moreover we define the bracket factor @xmath125 by @xmath126 and write @xmath127 etc . similarly .",
    "the idea in this calculus is to write @xmath108 symbolically as a power of a linear form in several ways : @xmath128 whence the identities @xmath129 if @xmath83 , define a covariant @xmath130 of order @xmath15 and degree @xmath15 by the following prescription : @xmath131 the formula for @xmath52 should be read in the following way : the right hand side of @xmath132 , when we multiply it out formally , is a sum of monomials @xmath133 , @xmath134 ^ 3 $ ] , @xmath135 ^ 3 $ ] , and @xmath136 , @xmath137 . thus one can use equations ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) to rewrite the right - hand - side unambiguously in terms of the coefficients @xmath138 of @xmath108 .",
    "hence @xmath52 may be viewed as a map from @xmath114 to @xmath115 , homogeneous of degree @xmath15 in the coefficients @xmath138 , which is clearly @xmath3-equivariant . by abuse of notation , we denote the induced rational map @xmath139 by the same letter . note that @xmath140 defined by equation @xmath141 may be viewed as an invariant of plane cubics @xmath142 of degree @xmath15 in the coefficients of the cubic .",
    "in fact , this is the famous clebsch invariant , vanishing on the locus of fermat cubics , or vanishing on the equi - anharmonic cubics , i.e. nonsingular plane cubics which can be written as a double cover of @xmath143 branched in four points with equi - anharmonic cross - ratio .",
    "equi - anharmonic cross - ratio means cross - ratio equal to minus a cube root of @xmath144 .",
    "equi - anharmonic quadruples of points in @xmath143 are one of the two possible @xmath145-orbits of @xmath15 points in @xmath143 with non - trivial isotropy group ( the other orbit being quadruples with harmonic cross - ratio , i.e. equal to @xmath146 , @xmath147 or @xmath42 ) .",
