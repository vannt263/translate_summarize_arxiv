    "a remarkable phenomenon associated with a fermi surface in a metal is the observation of periodic oscillations in thermodynamic and transport quantities as a function of the inverse of the magnetic field .",
    "this quantum effect is due to a quantization of landau levels , and its periodicity is proportional to the area enclosed by the fermi surface in two dimensions ( or the area enclosed by extremal orbits in three dimensions ) .",
    "one of the unsolved puzzles in the high temperature ( high t@xmath0 ) cuprates is a truncated fermi surface , dubbed the fermi arc , detected by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes).@xcite this can not be understood within a conventional theory  for instance , if the truncation occurred due to a broken translational symmetry , this would lead to brillouin zone folding , which has not been observed so far in arpes.@xcite this unconventional metallic state with a fermi arc has been called the pseudogap phase . up until 2007 , it seemed that quantum oscillations failed to occur in the pseudogap state of high t@xmath0 cuprates .    since the first striking report of the high t@xmath0 cuprates by doiron - leyraud _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite in 2007 , a series of experiments have reported quantum oscillations in yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3(ybco@xmath3 ) and yba@xmath1cu@xmath4o@xmath5 , high purity high t@xmath0 materials .",
    "@xcite the main frequency of oscillation of 540 t in ybco@xmath3 corresponds to 2 % of the area of the brillouin zone .",
    "this area deviates dramatically from the nominal doping of 10% expected from the luttinger sum rule .",
    "in contrast , overdoped tl@xmath1ba@xmath1cuo@xmath6 shows a single hole fermi surface@xcite which correspond to @xmath7 holes per cu satisfying the sum rule and further confirmed by the hall coefficient r@xmath8.@xcite a recent report displayed a similar contrast between overdoped samples and underdoped ones in the electron - doped nd@xmath9ce@xmath10cuo@xmath4 ( ncco ) where a large electron - like pocket is reported at @xmath11 , whereas small hole - like pockets are reported at @xmath12 and @xmath13.@xcite shortly after the experimental discoveries , several theoretical proposals have been made.@xcite most of them share the underlying idea that the quantum oscillation arise due to a broken symmetry .",
    "@xcite some have further offered a missing link between the fermi arc and quantum oscillation from a closed fermi surface .",
    "@xcite    however , the precise nature of the broken symmetry is still under debate.@xcite can we identify the order by analyzing the current experimental data of quantum oscillations ?",
    "one salient aspect of the available experimental data is a discrepancy between experimental reports in ybco@xmath3 .",
    "while they all agree that the main frequency of oscillation is about 540 t , the satellite frequencies are different .",
    "et al._@xcite confirmed the first observed main frequency of 540 t.@xcite in addition , they found satellite frequencies of 450 t , 630 t ( suggested to be due to a combination of warping of the fermi surface and bilayer splitting ) , and 1130 t ( suggested to be a second harmonic of the 540 t main frequency ) . on the other hand , whereas sebastian _",
    "et al._@xcite found the main frequency of 540 t , they also observed an additional satellite frequency of 1650 t. recently , riggs _",
    "_ reported similar oscillation frequencies in specific heat measurements as those found by sebastian _",
    "et al._@xcite we note that multiple frequencies have so far been found only in ortho - ii material and its understanding requires a study of magnetic breakdown .",
    "the ortho - ii potential present in ybco@xmath3 is not a strong potential , yet it is visible in some experimental probes .",
    "for example , while the effect of the ortho - ii potential on arpes is negligible@xcite , the potential has been detected in raman spectroscopy@xcite .",
    "one may naively expect that such a potential can be screened as pointed out in ref . .",
    "however , first principle studies show that the oxygen ordering leads to order in the ba position @xcite , which leads to a stronger ortho - ii potential than one would otherwise expect .",
    "a fermi - surface - induced lattice modulation was observed only in oxygen empty cuo chains via diffusive x - ray scattering measurements @xcite indicating the important role of oxygen ordering in electronic structures .",
    "it was recently suggested that the ortho - ii potential can be used to differentiate between two @xmath14 orders , antiferromagnetism and d - density wave orders.@xcite in this scenario , the ortho - ii potential plays an important role , but its relative weakness implies that magnetic breakdown effects must be taken into account explicitly .",
    "for instance , if the magnetic breakdown occurs below the field at which oscillations begin to appear ( 30 t ) , then the ortho - ii potential can be neglected altogether in the analysis of quantum oscillations . on the other hand ,",
    "if the breakdown occurs within the currently accessible field range of 30 - 60 t , then two different sets of fermi surfaces  corresponding to the fermi surface before and after the breakdown  may participate in the quantum oscillation . in this case",
    ", the dominant oscillation frequencies would depend sensitively on the field range at which a particular experiment is carried out .    in this paper",

    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "quantum oscillations are a quantum mechanical effect observed in metals with closed fermi surfaces at low temperatures in the presence of a magnetic field . as the intensity of the applied field increases , there are oscillations in the physical properties of the metal , including the magnetic moment ( named de haas - van alphen , dhva ) , resistivity ( shubnikov - de haas , sdh ) , specific heat , and sound attenuation .",
    "when plotted versus the inverse field , these quantities display a remarkable regularity in their oscillations .",
    "quantum oscillations can be understood via the semiclassical quantization of quasiparticle energies in an applied magnetic field .",
    "they are of great significance for their relation with fermi surface geometry : the frequency of oscillations ( in tesla ) is related to the area enclosed by a fermi pocket ( in 2 dimensions ) or the area enclosed by an extremal orbit of the fermi surface ( in 3 dimensions ) by the following equation : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the area enclosed by the fermi pocket and @xmath17 is the frequency of oscillations . if there are multiple pockets ( or multiple extremal orbits ) , that will result in multiple frequencies that can be determined by fourier transform .",
    "the different frequencies are constrained by the luttinger sum rule which relates the density of carriers to the area enclosed by the fermi pocket through : @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the lattice constants and the factor of @xmath20 comes from spin degree of freedom .",
    "therefore , we can relate the carrier density to the frequency of oscillation found through : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the unit quantum flux .",
    "one must be careful when working with a broken translational symmetry to work in the reduced brillouin zone ( rbz ) . in the cases that we will study",
    ", this will be important .",
    "the luttinger sum rule specifies that the total doping @xmath23 is equal to the sum of carrier density for each pocket , that is @xmath24 where h.l.p mean hole - like pocket and e.l.p means electron - like pocket .",
    "we can easily convert this equation using the frequency of each pocket : @xmath25 this equation establishes a constraint on the frequencies of the system .",
    "magnetic breakdown is an effect that occurs at large magnetic fields for systems with multiple fermi pockets that almost intersect one - another . as first discussed by cohen and falikov@xcite",
    ", magnetic breakdown happens when the transition amplitude for the quasiparticle to tunnel from one band to the other become sizeable as the magnetic field increases .",
    "a semiclassical treatment shows that magnetic breakdown occurs approximately when the condition @xmath26 is satisfied@xcite . here , @xmath27 is the fermi energy , and @xmath28 is the energy splitting of two bands generated by a small perturbation such as a spin density wave , a charge density wave order or some lattice potential . in terms of the breakdown field",
    "( @xmath29 ) , this can be written as @xmath30    a more general treatment@xcite yields a useful formula involving only the local geometry of the fermi surface to find the breakdown field which , in the case of almost free electrons reduces to @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the k - space distance between the two bands at the chemical potential in units of @xmath33 .",
    "this equation can also be written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "the constant of @xmath36 in refs .",
    "@xcite is obtained using a circular orbit as the local geometry of the fermi surface .",
    "however in general , this constant will depend on the details of the geometry of the fermi surface at the band separation .",
    "we therefore define a constant @xmath37 as @xmath38 below , we will show how @xmath37 depends on the fs curvature .",
    "it is important to note that magnetic breakdown does not occur at a sharply - defined field , but is a crossover effect .",
    "it is usually defined to be the field at which the probability for tunnelling is equal to @xmath39 . in our numerical simulations",
    "below , we will define the magnetic breakdown field to be the field at which the intensity of oscillations arising from the pockets in the original fermi surface is equal to the intensity of the pockets after reconstruction of the fermi surface .",
    "therefore , one should note that the intensity of oscillations from the reconstructed fermi surface is still visible after the breakdown field as defined in this paper .    to study the effect of curvature on magnetic breakdown , we compute the value of @xmath37 for various systems that have different curvature .",
    "our numerical simulations consist of solving a lattice model in an applied magnetic field .",
    "the mean - field hamiltonian is given by @xmath40 here , @xmath41 creates an electron with spin @xmath42 at site @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the chemical potential , @xmath45 is the ortho - ii potential , which is staggered in the @xmath46-direction , and @xmath47 is the order parameter of the broken symmetry , like an antiferromagnet . the amplitudes @xmath48 are real , and we keep nearest neighbor ( @xmath49 ) , next - nearest neighbor ( @xmath50 ) , and third nearest neighbor ( @xmath51 ) hoppings .",
    "in addition , the orbital effect of magnetic field has been introduced in the standard manner through the peierls substitution @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the vector potential .",
    "the three specific systems used to study the fermi surface curvature dependence of @xmath37 are ( a ) : @xmath45 finite and @xmath55 , ( b ) : @xmath56 and @xmath47 finite and ( c ) : both @xmath45 and @xmath47 finite .",

    "we obtain the quasiparticle spectrum of the total hamiltonian by exact diagonalization of bloch wave functions on a magnetic unit cell of size @xmath57.@xcite the inclusion of an orbital magnetic field implies that , for any given fixed gauge , the vector potential appears to break translational invariance .",
    "translational invariance is restored to the system by noting that translations by @xmath58 and @xmath59 must be accompanied by appropriate gauge transformations .",
    "this can only be done in a consistent fashion provided that the magnetic flux piercing the magnetic unit cell is quantized , @xmath60.@xcite here @xmath61 is an integer , and @xmath62 is the quantum of flux . in our simulations , we fix the height of the magnetic unit cell @xmath63 , and also fix a single flux quantum per magnetic unit cell .",
    "we then sweep the magnetic field by varying the width @xmath58 of the magnetic unit cell , @xmath64 .    in each system , in order to compute @xmath37 , we vary the different parameters in order to obtain different values of @xmath32 . for each value of @xmath32 , we then compute the energy , the density of states ( dos ) and magnetization of the system as a function of magnetic field . fig .

    "fig : dhva ] shows an example of magnetization as a function of the inverse field .",
    "we then compute the breakdown field by use of a `` field - dependent fourier transform '' , which consists of computing the fourier spectrum over a narrow window of fields , and shifting the position of these windows to get a running field dependence for the fourier spectrum .",
    "we require the window of fields to be broad enough to contain a few oscillations of all relevant frequencies , but narrow enough to detect the magnetic breakdown .",

    "( [ eq : bgdisp ] ) is only true for antiferromagnetism .",
    "note that an ortho - ii system with ddw ordering has a similar zone folding to the af+ortho - ii case considered here .",

    "table [ table : nonlin ] shows the fourier intensities , computed in the range of @xmath131 t , of all the pockets for different broadening .",
    "note that the oscillation intensity is more sensitive to disorder for some pockets than for others ; hence , broadening has a direct effect on b * , which is also shown in the table .",
    ".fourier spectrum as a function of broadening . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : nonlin ]    note that for @xmath132 mev , the oscillation intensity from the @xmath101 pocket , i@xmath133 is still visible , but that for @xmath134 mev , i@xmath133 is gone .",
    "hence a small difference in @xmath130 can make a qualitative difference in the fourier spectrum .",
    "this is understandable because the broadening of the landau levels will affect the larger frequencies more than the smaller ones .",
    "this is why i@xmath135 goes from being the smallest at @xmath136 mev to being the largest at @xmath134 mev ( see table [ table : nonlin ] ) .",
    "the @xmath68 pocket , having the smallest frequency , is also the least affected by broadening .",
    "another important aspect of fourier spectrum produced from our analysis is the difference between the relative intensities of our multiple peaks and those observed in experiment .",
    "for example , in our case , the @xmath137 pocket is the dominant peak unless the disorder broadening is greater than 3 mev , while its measured amplitude is small , and not confirmed by all of the experimental groups .",
    "one way to reconcile the difference is to introduce an anisotropic scattering on the fermi surface .",
    "if the quasiparticle scattering rate is momentum - dependent , then it is possible to obtain the electron pocket , @xmath122 , to be the dominant frequency .",
    "for example , if quasiparticles near @xmath138 ( where the hole pockets are ) have a larger scattering rate than the quasiparticles near @xmath139 and @xmath140 ( where the electron pockets are ) , then the @xmath122 pocket could get the largest intensity . however , this contrasts with the anisotropic scattering observed by arpes at high temperatures in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "it was shown that the scattering rate deduced from the imaginary part of the self energy is lower along the node compared to the antinode direction@xcite . however , as we discussed in the introduction , the arpes have shown the fermi arc at high temperatures ( above t@xmath0 ) without the magnetic field , and it is possible that the low temperature and high field state may not be smoothly connected to a high temperature and zero field pseudogap phase .",
    "in both la@xmath9sr@xmath10cuo@xmath4 and yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath6 , neutron scattering experiments have reported strong inelastic signals at incommensurate wave vectors , ( @xmath141).@xcite later , it was found that the quasi - elastic incommensurate peak intensity increases linearly with magnetic field in ybco@xmath142.@xcite it was also proposed that an incommensurate spiral order is induced by a magnetic field leading to a fermi surface reconstruction responsible for the quantum oscillations.@xcite it is worthwhile to investigate the effect of the ortho - ii potential for the incommensurate spiral order case . while our analysis is specific to the spiral spin density wave , it can be generalized to a collinear incommensurate case if the higher order gaps are smaller than the gap generated by the ortho - ii potential.@xcite in other words , if we keep only the first order gap generated by an incommensurate collinear order our analysis leads to the same results as for the spiral case .",

    "smoother fermi surface curvature , modified by the potential , also increases the breakdown field .",
    "we found that the magnetic breakdown field ( defined as the field strength at which the intensities of the original and modified frequencies match ) can change from 25 t to 100 t. for example , a factor of 4 increase can be achieved if the ortho - ii potential ( @xmath45 ) increases from 0.08 to 0.1 and the af order strength ( @xmath174 ) from 0.07 to 0.1 .",
    "ddw in bilayers gives similar results , if there is a circulating current between the layers .    while the shape of the fermi surface depends on an exact broken symmetry ( as shown in fig . 2 for the af + ortho - ii case and in fig .",
    "10 for the incommensurate spiral spin density wave ) , the presence of multiple frequencies strongly supports a broken translational symmetry . among several frequencies observed in experiments , the presence of the 1650 t frequency",
    "can be explained by a @xmath101-pocket that occurs due to a near ( @xmath173)-folding and a ( @xmath172)-folding ( from ortho - ii potential ) of the fermi surface and that such pocket stop yielding oscillations beyond b@xmath94 .    in our analysis ,",
    "the intensity of each frequency depends on the disorder strength .",
    "a disorder broadening @xmath130 bigger than 3 mev ( which is consistent with experimental values ) makes the @xmath101 pocket , corresponding to the 1650 t frequency , disappear .",
    "this is simply because a larger broadening makes faster oscillations ( larger frequency ) less visible .",
    "the disorder strength also affects the intensity of the other frequencies .",
    "as demonstrated in table i , the @xmath68 pocket has the highest intensity for a 3 mev broadening",
    ". one could argue that the main frequency is a hole pocket ( like the @xmath68 pocket in our model)@xcite .",
    "however , the difficulty with that argument is that a main frequency of 660 t was observed in yba@xmath1cu@xmath4o@xmath5 , an ortho - ii free material . as pointed out in ref .",
    ", the electron pocket is insensitive to the ortho - ii potential while the hole pocket is strongly modified .",
    "therefore if a similar small frequency is a universal phenomenon in high t@xmath0 cuprates , the main frequency should be one that is not modified by the ortho - ii potential , such as the @xmath122-pocket in this model .",
    "in addition , we extended our study to systems with incommensurate orders , which undergo a series of breakdowns with distinctly different fermi surface shapes . to make progress in understanding the topology of the fermi surface and associated order , a systematic study of the magnetic field angle dependence on the quantum oscillations and further arpes studies in both ortho - ii and ortho - ii - free materials are necessary .",
