    "in  @xcite we have presented a new calculation of the  @xmath1 renormalized lagrangian of heavy quark effective field theory ( hqet ) at  @xmath0 .",
    "this result has been confirmed using different calculational strategies in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) . in this note",
    "we proceed with the results of a calculation of the renormalized heavy - light and heavy - heavy currents in the same order .",
    "the goal is a systematic calculation of the matrix element @xmath2 up to and including  @xmath0 , including leading order qcd radiative corrections .",
    "a full calculation of the matrix element  ( [ eq : megen ] ) of the heavy - heavy current at non - zero recoil is technically feasible , but still of limited phenomenological value .",
    "the appearance of the second independent velocity vector  @xmath3 leads to a proliferation of operators whose matrix element would have to be parametrized .",
    "this results in a substantial decrease in predictive power . instead we will follow  @xcite and concentrate on the zero recoil case  @xmath4 , which should be considered as the lowest order of an expansion of the matrix element ( [ eq : megen ] ) at the symmetry point  @xmath5 .",
    "in this case luke s celebrated theorem  @xcite guarantees that there are no  @xmath6 corrections to the current , but there are non - trivial contributions at  @xmath0  @xcite .    this note is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : basis ] we define our operatorbasis for the effective lagrangian , heavy - light and heavy - heavy currents up to and including  @xmath7 .",
    "our result for the anomalous dimensions will be presented in section [ sec : anodim ] followed by a discussion of various consistency checks in section  [ sec : checks ] . in section  [ sec : rge ] the numerical solution of the renormalization group equation ( rge ) for the currents at  @xmath8 is presented and is discussed with respect to phenomenological applications .",
    "we start with the current up to  @xmath9 and the operators in the effective lagrangian needed for the construction of time - ordered products in  @xmath10 .",
    "the kinetic and chromomagnetic operators in the effective lagrangian of dimensions 5    [ eq : lag12 ] @xmath11    are labeled by a flavor index for future use .",
    "we choose the operatorbasis for the currents of dimensions  3 and  4 as    [ curr01 ] @xmath12 and  @xmath13 : @xmath14    in  ( [ eq : curr1 ] ) the label  @xmath15 runs from left to right . because of the momentum transfer at the weak current , we have to distinguish derivatives  @xmath16 acting to the left from derivatives  @xmath17 acting to the right in the operator basis .",
    "it turns out that not all operators that contain two of these derivatives are independent .",
    "in fact there are _ arrow identities  ( ai ) _ , that we have to take into account :    [ eq : ai ] @xmath18 h_v= &   i\\partial_{\\alpha}i\\partial_{\\beta}\\bar c_l h_v\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the identities  @xmath19 are operator identities and we stress that their derivation  @xcite is independent from the applicability of partial integration .",
    "the identity  ( [ eq : arrowid ] ) results in additional contributions to the anomalous dimensions from the divergent parts of the two point function with dimension 5 operator insertions .",
    "the  ai and the equation of motion  ( eom ) for the heavy quark  @xmath20 reduce the full set of 56  local operators to 26  operators @xmath21 , which we choose as    @xmath22    where the  @xmath23 on the left and the  @xmath24 on the right have been suppressed .",
    "since  @xmath25 , the full basis contains 18  operators proportional to  @xmath26 as well as  @xmath27 , which can be eliminated using the eom for the light quark @xmath28 in  @xcite the operator basis could be divided naturally in four classes : vanishing by the equations of motion  ( eom ) or not , local or time - ordered product .",
    "this time we have to consider another class of unphysical operators , that are related to the other operators by  _",
    "contraction identities  ( ci)_. these identities arise in time - ordered products with @xmath29-operators acting on _ internal _ heavy quark propagators  @xcite .",
    "they are independent from the external states and can be illustrated graphically as follows : @xmath30[\\bar h_{v } b\\ldots ] }       & \\propto\\tprod { \\ldots ab \\ldots } \\\\    \\parbox{45 mm } {     \\begin{fmfgraph*}(45,10 )        \\fmfleft{hi}\\fmfright{qo }        \\fmf{dbl_plain_arrow}{hi , op1 }        \\fmf{dbl_plain_arrow}{op1,op2 }        \\fmf{plain_arrow , tension=2}{op2,qo }        { \\fmfv{d.sh = circle , d.si=13mm , d.f=0,l=$a(iv{\\overrightarrow{d}})$,l.d=0}{op1 } }        { \\fmfv{d.sh = circle , d.si=5mm , d.f=0,l=$b$,l.d=0}{op2 } }      \\end{fmfgraph * } }      & \\propto        \\parbox{25 mm } {          \\begin{fmfgraph*}(25,10 )            \\fmfleft{hi}\\fmfright{qo }            \\fmf{dbl_plain_arrow}{hi , op1 }            \\fmf{plain_arrow}{op1,qo }            { \\fmfv{d.sh = circle , d.si=7mm , d.f=0,l=$ab$,l.d=0}{op1 } }          \\end{fmfgraph*}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] even though their derivation proceeds in terms of unrenormalized operators , the  ci hold true under renormalization in the @xmath31-scheme , which we haved used .",
    "the full basis contains 56  time - ordered products of lower order contributions to the current with operators from the effective lagrangian of the @xmath32-quark .",
    "after application of the  ci and the  eom for the heavy quark , we are left with 26  time - ordered products .",
    "they are classified as follows :    * double - insertions from the effective lagrangian in @xmath33 : @xmath34 the prefactor accounts for insertions of identical operators .",
    "to avoid double - counting the additional constraint  @xmath35 has to be imposed . * single - insertions from the effective lagrangian in @xmath36 : @xmath37 * mixed insertions of dimension  4 currents and the effective lagrangian in @xmath38 : @xmath39      the construction of the operator basis contributing to the heavy - heavy current proceeds in analogy to the heavy - light current .",
    "since the @xmath40-quark is now static , the tensor structures of flavor changing operators are projected from the left by  @xmath41 and we have to consider additional time - ordered products with operators in the effective lagrangian of the static @xmath40-quark .",
    "to lowest order only two operators contribute : @xmath42 at order  @xmath43 , all operators sandwiched between physical states vanish by luke s theorem and may be discarded . at order  @xmath44 the full basis",
    "contains 14  local and 100  nonlocal operators .",
    "after application of  ci and  eom for the heavy quarks , we are left with 46  operators .",
    "the action of spin and flavor symmetry in the matrix elements of time - ordered products reveals 20  additional relations . using flavor symmetry , for example",
    ", the matrix elements of  @xmath45 and  @xmath46 between mesonic states   @xmath47 and  @xmath48 are described by the same reduced matrix element multiplied by clebsch - gordan coefficients @xmath49 with  @xmath50 , @xmath51 and  @xmath52 representing the dirac - structure of the current , the chromomagnetic operator and the external states respectively .",
    "since the former is sandwiched between projectors  @xmath41 , it conserves spin symmetry and may be moved around freely inside the traces .",
    "consequently the traces are equal and so are the matrix elements .",
    "other relations among matrix elements can be established analoguously .",
    "furthermore , since spin symmetry allows us to rewrite all mixed time - ordered products in terms of eom - operators , they are removed from the basis applying the  ci .",
    "the basis is reduced by these relations to 6  local operators @xmath53 taken between static fields  @xmath54 and  @xmath55 and 20  time - ordered products @xmath56 where all indices run from  1 to  2 .",
    "as in  @xcite , we have calculated the anomalous dimensions in the background field gauge with gauge parameter  @xmath57 . for the physical operator bases presented here , all @xmath57-dependence has to drop out , which provides a powerful cross - check . in the case of heavy - light currents ,",
    "the anomalous dimensions in leading and subleading order are well known  @xcite and are reproduced by our calculations .",
    "our result in  @xmath58 can be written in block form , separating local operators from time - ordered products : @xmath59 weinberg s theorem guarantees that local operators need no non - local counterterms .",
    "this accounts for the vanishing of seven submatrices in  ( [ eq : anodim2hl ] ) .",
    "there are , however , nonlocal contributions  @xmath60 and  @xmath61 that arise from the renormalization of the lagrangian or the lower order current .",
    "this situation is depicted diagramatically in figure  [ fig : diagillust ] .",
    "@xmath62    our result for the heavy - heavy currents at the same order is of similiar structure : @xmath63 the entries for all submatrices  @xmath64 are available from the authors on request .",
    "a typical example is given by the anomalous dimensions of the local operators : @xmath65 the observation , that the kinetic and chromomagnetic operators ( the upper left and the lower right @xmath66-block ) renormalize as their counterparts in the effective lagrangian in  @xmath43 , is easily explained by the fact that both operator bases coincide at zero recoil up to parity violating contributions .",
    "the anomalous dimensions have been calculated with the help of ` form `  @xcite . in the background field gauge ,",
    "the divergent part of the three - point function has to be calculated to derive the anomalous dimensions .",
    "the latter receive additional contributions from the two - point function only in the case of heavy - light currents as a result of the identity  ( [ eq : arrowid ] ) .",
    "in section  [ sec : basis ] we have used several identities to reduce our operatorbasis .",
    "however , we have to verify that this reduction is compatible with the  rge .",
    "suppose that a linear combination @xmath67 of operators does not contribute to the matrix element under consideration @xmath68 in general , this relation will not be stable under renormalization since @xmath69 and @xmath70 unless  @xmath71 satisfies further conditions .    for a consistent reduction of the operatorbasis we have to start with the anomalous dimensions of the full operatorbasis .",
    "whenever an operator identity  ( [ eq : red ] ) , e.g.  ci or eom , is applied to reduce the full operatorbasis , we have verified its compatibility with the rge . also , the relations between matrix elements of heavy - heavy currents have been shown stable under renormalization .    in the background field gauge ,",
    "only the anomalous dimensions of operators that are manifestly invariant under gauge transformations of the background field have to be calculated .",
    "the ward identities of the underlying brst - symmetry are particularly simple and provide a powerful cross - check of our results  @xcite . from the ward identities for the background field and the gauge parameter dependence of the effective action follows , that the counterterms proportional to  @xmath72 have to be transversal and should not depend on  @xmath57 .",
    "our results pass these consistency checks .",
    "additional checks are provided by the construction of relations among operators .",
    "for example , the differentiation of the lowest order currents @xmath73 leaves their anomalous dimensions unaffected and relates them to subleading operators .",
    "the operators on the right hand side must mix under renormalization in such a way , that their sum can be expressed by the total derivative of the current on the left hand side , which renormalizes multiplicatively .",
    "our result is consistent with all relations of this type , including generalizations to local operators of higher dimension and time - ordered products .",
    "as in any effective field theory calculation , we sum the radiative corrections by matching the operators at the thresholds and by running their coefficients between thresholds . in the case at hand , we have two thresholds  @xmath74 and  @xmath75 .",
    "it is convenient to express the matching conditions as matrices  @xmath76 @xmath77 and  @xmath78 @xmath79 since there is only one qcd - operator , @xmath76 reduces to a vector .",
    "the @xmath80 contain all physical local operators and time - ordered products up to and including dimension 5 , that contribute to heavy - light and heavy - heavy currents respectively .",
    "consequently the matching matrices receive contributions suppressed by inverse powers of the c- and b - quark masses up to and including  @xmath81 .",
    "in addition , the matching of hl - operators with a covariant derivative acting on  @xmath82 induces a nontrivial @xmath83-dependence in  @xmath78 .",
    "for example , we have to lowest order @xmath84      for the lagrangian at  @xmath85 , only five operators do not vanish by the eom  @xcite and an analytical solution of the rge is straightforward .",
    "in contrast , the operator bases for the heavy - light and heavy - heavy currents contain  52 and  26 operators respectively and an analytical solution of the  rge is impractical , to say the least    in each order  @xmath86 , the solution of the  rge is expressed in terms of evolution matrices @xmath87 in  @xmath88 , the number of active flavors takes the values  @xmath89 and  @xmath90 for heavy - light and heavy - heavy currents respectively .",
    "introducing their direct sum @xmath91 the combined solution for the wilson coefficients at the hadronic scale can be written in compact form : @xmath92 the lowest order currents are conserved at zero recoil , therefore  @xmath93 in  ( [ eq : evmhh ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we can set  @xmath94 because luke s theorem renders the corresponding contribution irrelevant .    for practical purposes , it is most convenient to sum the power series of the exponential in  ( [ eq : rhl ] ) directly .",
    "this series converges fast and any desired accuracy can be obtained .",
    "this procedure is used in the numerical results in table  [ tab : hh3 ] , where a factor of  @xmath95 must be attached to the higher order coefficients .",
    "we also present the tree - level values of the coefficients to expose the effect of the radiative corrections .",
    "we stress that the matrices  @xmath96 are defective , i.e.  do not have a complete set of eigenvalues",
    ". therefore the analysis of  @xcite is not applicable and we can not derive general properties of the  rg evolution from the spectrum of the matrices .",
    "let us finally discuss phenomenological applications of our result .    from the coefficient  @xmath97 of the lowest order symmetry breaking operator in the top row of table  [ tab : hh3 ] ,",
    "one obtains a value of  1.180 for the short - distance coefficient  @xmath98 of the axial vector current which is larger than  @xmath99 .",
    "this contradicts the established result in  @xcite which is smaller than  @xmath99 .",
    "this apparent contradiction is resolved if one takes into account the complementarity of the calculational approaches .",
    "our calculation uses effective field theory to resum corrections  @xmath100 from the running between  @xmath101 and  @xmath26 , while  @xcite integrates out the b- and c - quarks simultanuously .",
    "the latter approach resums the powers of  @xmath102 . after applying radiative corrections ,",
    "@xcite includes  @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , while we have concentrated on  @xmath106 , @xmath107 and  @xmath108 . therefore our result for  @xmath109",
    "should not be taken face value . instead , our terms   @xmath108 with  @xmath110 are corrections to the result of  @xcite . in practice",
    "this means that the term  @xmath111 should be subtracted from our result an the remaining correction should be added to the result of  @xcite .",
    "this correction is  @xmath112 and the final result for  @xmath109 remains below  @xmath99 .",
    "up to  @xmath113 no form factors are needed to parameterize the matrix elements in the effective theory .",
    "the lowest order is normalized and luke s theorem states the absence of contributions at  @xmath113 .    in  @xmath81 the constraints of spin and flavor symmetry are less powerful .",
    "an expansion of the matrixelements in terms of 12  nonperturbative formfactors has been performed in  @xcite on tree - level .",
    "our result can be used to extend this analysis to include short - distance corrections .",
    "however , lukes s theorem , which has been used extensively in  @xcite , receives radiative corrections at  @xmath81 . therefore the analysis of  @xcite has to be refined to include these corrections .",
    ".[tab : hh3 ] wilson coefficients in tree - level and one - loop approximation .",
    "a factor  @xmath114 is to be attached to the coefficients of higher order operators . for the quark masses we use the values  @xmath115 and  @xmath116 and for the initial value of the running coupling constant",
    "we use  @xmath117 . [ cols=\"^,>,>,^,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have presented a calculation of renormalized heavy - light and heavy - heavy currents at order  @xmath85 .",
    "the anomalous dimensions of the relevant operatorbasis of dimension  5 pass various consistency checks .",
    "we have solved the renormalization group equation numerically for the wilson - coefficients of heavy - light and heavy - heavy currents , matching both quantities at the @xmath118-threshold .",
    "we have presented the numerical values of the coefficients of the heavy - heavy current at the hadronic scale .",
    "the two expansion parameters  @xmath119 and  @xmath120 are numerically of the same order ( for currently accessible values of  @xmath121 ) .",
    "therefore phenomenological applications should consider also pieces of  @xmath122 as well as  @xmath123 .",
    "while the former have been available for a long time  @xcite , the latter have been inferred by reparametrization invariance arguments , which should be used with care  @xcite",
    ". a direct calculation will be the subject of future investigations .",
