    "due to the difficulty of obtaining experimental evidence , theoretical and numerical analyses are useful .",
    "four separate scenarios for the pressure  temperature ( @xmath10 ) phase diagram have been proposed :    \\(i ) the _ stability limit _ ( sl )",
    "scenario  @xcite hypothesizes that the superheated liquid - gas spinodal at negative pressure re - enters the positive @xmath11 region below @xmath12 . in this view , the liquid state is delimited by a single continuous locus , @xmath13 , bounding the superheated , stretched and supercooled states .",
    "there is no reference to the phase into which the liquid transforms when @xmath14 . as the spinodal is approached , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath15 .",
    "a thermodynamic consequence of the sl scenario is that the intersection of the retracing spinodal with the liquid ",
    "vapor coexistence line must be a critical point  @xcite .",
    "the presence of a such a critical point in the liquid  vapor transition , although possible , is not confirmed by any experiment .",
    "this fact poses a serious challenge to the sl scenario .",
    "\\(ii ) the _ liquid  liquid critical point _",
    "( llcp ) scenario @xcite hypothesizes a first  order phase transition line between two liquids  a low density liquid ( ldl ) , and a high density liquid ( hdl )  which terminates at a liquid  liquid critical point @xmath16 .",
    "hdl is a dense liquid with a highly disordered structure , whereas ldl has a lower density and locally tetrahedral order .",
    "the experimentally observable high density amorphous ( hda ) and low density amorphous ( lda ) solids correspond , in this scenario , to a structurally arrested state of hdl and ldl respectively  @xcite .",
    "starting from @xmath16 , the locus of maxima of the correlation length @xmath17 ( the widom line ) projects into the one  phase region  @xcite .",
    "asymptotically close to the critical point , response functions can be expressed in terms of @xmath17 , hence , these too will show maxima , e.g. , as a function of @xmath18 upon isobaric cooling . these maxima will diverge upon approaching @xmath16 . furthermore , for @xmath19 , the pressure of @xmath16 , the response functions will diverge by approaching the spinodal converging to @xmath16 .",
    "specific models suggest  @xcite that @xmath20 , but the possibility @xmath21 has also been proposed  @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) the _ singularity  free _ ( sf ) scenario  @xcite hypothesizes that the low-@xmath18 anticorrelation between volume and entropy is sufficient to cause the response functions to increase upon cooling and display maxima at non  zero @xmath18 , without reference to any singular behavior .",
    "specifically , sastry _ et al . _",
    "@xcite consider the temperature of maximum density ( tmd ) line , where the density has a maximum as a function of temperature , and prove a general thermodynamic theorem establishing the proportionality between the slope of the tmd , @xmath22 , and the temperature derivative of @xmath4 .",
    "thus , since the tmd has negative slope in water , it follows that @xmath23 , and therefore @xmath4 must increase upon cooling , whether there exists a singularity or not .",
    "\\(iv ) the  _ critical  point free _ ( cpf ) scenario @xcite hypothesizes an order  disorder transition , with possibly a weak first  order transition character , separating two liquid phases and extending to @xmath24 down to the superheated limit of stability of liquid water .",
    "this scenario effectively predicts a continuous locus of stability limit spanning the superheated , stretched and supercooled state , because the spinodal associated with the first ",
    "order transition will intersect the liquid ",
    "gas spinodal at negative pressure .",
    "no critical point is present in this scenario .",
    "these four scenarios predict fundamentally different behavior , though each has been rationalized as a consequence of the same microscopic interaction : the h bond .",
    "a question that naturally arises is whether the macroscopic thermodynamic descriptions are in fact connected in some way .",
    "previous works have attempted to uncover relations between several of the scenarios , for example between ( i ) and ( ii ) @xcite or ( ii ) and ( iii ) @xcite . here",
    "we offer a relation linking all four scenarios showing that ( a ) all four can be included in one general scheme , ( b ) the balance between the energies of two components of the h bond interaction determines which scenario is valid .",
    "morevover , we argue that current values for these energies support the llcp scenario .",
    "we analyze a microscopic model  @xcite of water in which the fluid is divided into @xmath25 cells with nearest neighbor ( n.n . ) interactions .",
    "the division is such that each cell is in contact with four n.n .",
    ", mimicking the first shell of liquid water .",
    "the case of a shared h bond , due to more than four molecules in the first shell , is assimilated with the case in which a h bond is broken , since the interaction energy of a shared bond is less than half the energy of a single h bond @xcite .",
    "the goal of the model is to represent , microscopically , the essential features of the interaction among water molecules , while being able to qualitatively understand the importance of each of these features . to this end",
    "the interaction among cells is separated into four distinct components .",
    "the first component of the interaction is due to the short  range repulsion of the electron clouds .",
    "this is incorporated into the model by assigning to each cell @xmath26 $ ] ( a ) a volume @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the exclusion volume per molecule , and ( b ) a maximum of one molecule .",
    "the second component includes all the isotropic long  range attractive interactions , such as the instantaneous induced dipole - dipole ( london ) interactions between the electron clouds of different molecules or the isotropic part of the hydrogen bond  @xcite .",
    "we refer to this component as the van der waals attractive interaction , keeping in mind , however , that this component includes not only the ( weak ) london dispersion interaction , but also the ( stronger ) isotropic interaction of the hydrogen bond .",
    "the overall sum of the isotropic attractive and repulsive interactions can be represented in different ways .",
    "the one we adopt in a mean field ( mf ) treatment is @xmath29 where if @xmath30 we set the index @xmath31 , and if @xmath32 we set @xmath33 , hence @xmath31 if the density in the cell is gas - like , and @xmath33 if the density in the cell is liquid - like ; @xmath34 is the characteristic energy of the attraction and the sum is over all n.n .",
    "pairs @xmath35 .",
    "the characteristic feature of h@xmath36o is its ability to form h bonds between neighboring molecules .",
    "this interaction has a strong directional component due to the dipole - dipole interaction between the highly concentrated positive charge on each h and each of the two excess negative charges concentrated on the o of another water molecule .",
    "accordingly , the third component incorporated here is this orientational ",
    "dependent interaction , which includes the covalent component of the bond  @xcite . to account for the orientational degrees of freedom of each water molecule ,",
    "we assign to each cell @xmath37 four bond variables @xmath38 ( one for each n.n .",
    "cell @xmath39 ) , representing the orientation of molecule @xmath37 with respect to molecule @xmath39 .",
    "we choose the parameter @xmath40 by selecting 30@xmath41 as the maximum deviation from a linear bond , i.e. @xmath42 , hence every molecule has @xmath43 possible orientations .",
    "( the effect of choosing a different value for @xmath40 has been analyzed in  @xcite . )",
    "we say that a bond is formed between cells @xmath37 and @xmath39 if @xmath44 .",
    "experiments show that formation of the h bonds leads to an open locally tetrahedral structure that induces an increase of volume per molecule  @xcite .",
    "this effect is incorporated in the model by considering the total volume to be given as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the total number of h bonds , @xmath47 if @xmath48 , @xmath49 if @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is the volume increase per h bond  @xcite .",
    "bond formation also leads to a decrease in the local potential energy , hence we add to the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ vdw ] ) the term @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the characteristic energy of the directional component of the h bond .",
    "another key experimental fact is that at low @xmath18 the o  o  o angle distribution in water becomes sharper around the tetrahedral value  @xcite , suggesting an interaction that induces a cooperative behavior among bonds . for water , four  body and higher order interactions seem to be negligible with respect to the three  body term  @xcite . hence , the fourth component to the interaction potential is the many ",
    "body effect due to h bonds  @xcite , which minimizes the energy when the h bonds of nearby molecules assume a tetrahedral orientation .",
    "this is accomplished by further adding to the hamiltonian in eqs .",
    "( [ vdw ] ) and ( [ hb ] ) the term @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the characteristic energy of the cooperative component of the h bond , and @xmath56 indicates one of the six different pairs of the four bond variables of molecule @xmath37 .",
    "this interaction introduces a cooperative behavior among bonds , which may be fine tuned by changing @xmath57 .",
    "choosing @xmath58 leads to h bonds which form independent of neighboring bonds  @xcite , while @xmath59 leads to fully dependent bonds  @xcite .",
    "the total hamiltonian is now given by @xmath60    this model is studied using both mf analysis and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations  @xcite .",
    "details of the mf and mc techniques are available elsewhere  @xcite . in the following we adopt @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "three qualitatively different phase diagrams are found , dependent on the strengths of the h bond energy parameters , @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( fig .  [ 1 ] ) .    when @xmath66 the model coincides with that proposed in @xcite , which gives rise to the sf scenario ( fig .",
    "[ 1]a ) . for @xmath67",
    "the model displays a liquid  liquid transition ending in a llcp at @xmath68 ( fig .",
    "[ 1]b ) @xcite . for @xmath69 , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are fitting parameters ,",
    "a llcp occurs at @xmath21 ( fig .",
    "[ 1]c ) . for @xmath72 ,",
    "a liquid - liquid transition with no critical point is found , consistent with the cpf scenario ( fig .  [ 1]d ) . in fig .  [ 2 ] we summarize these results in the @xmath64 vs. @xmath65 parameter space .      in the following",
    "we discuss how , by tuning @xmath64 and @xmath65 , we can pass from one scenario to another in a continuous way .",
    "\\(i ) by beginning with the llcp scenario , and studying the limit @xmath73 , we find @xmath74 .",
    "moreover , we find that @xmath4 and @xmath6 diverge as @xmath75 for any value of @xmath57 , including @xmath76 and @xmath74 .",
    "further , we find for the entropy @xmath77 that , for any value of @xmath57 , @xmath78 . hence @xmath79 diverges as @xmath75 when @xmath80 .",
    "when @xmath81 ( @xmath66 ) , @xmath5 is constant , as in the sf scenario @xcite .",
    "therefore , the sf scenario coincides with the llcp scenario in the limiting case of @xmath74 , for @xmath73 ( fig . [ 1]a ) .",
    "\\(ii ) again , beginning with the llcp scenario , and increasing @xmath65 while keeping other parameters constant , we observe that @xmath16 moves to larger @xmath18 and lower @xmath11 , with @xmath21 for @xmath82 ( fig.[1]c ) .",
    "\\(iii ) with further increase of @xmath65 , @xmath16 approaches , and eventually reaches , the liquid  gas spinodal . for larger values of @xmath65 only the liquid ",
    "liquid transition remains , which is precisely the cpf scenario @xcite ( fig .",
    "hence the cpf scenario differs from the llcp scenario only in that @xmath16 is now inaccessible , lying beyond the region of liquid states .",
    "the same result may be obtained by decreasing @xmath64 , while fixing @xmath65 and other parameters . here a decrease of @xmath83 moves @xmath16 to lower pressure , i.e. towards the liquid spinodal , while the entire liquid - liquid phenomena moves to succesively lower temperature . in all cases ,",
    "the location of @xmath16 varies continuously with variation of @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "\\(iv ) in the case of the cpf scenario , we find that the superheated liquid - gas spinodal merges with the supercooled liquid - liquid spinodal , as in ref .",
    "this gives rise to a liquid spinodal which retraces in the @xmath11@xmath18 plane .",
    "this feature resembles the main characteristic of the sl scenario , where the high-@xmath18 liquid has a limit of stability at @xmath24 that retraces toward @xmath84 at low @xmath18 . here",
    "this retracing locus is formed by two spinodal lines , with different signs of the slope , that merge at @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , in the framework of the present model , the cpf scenario and the sl scenario coincide , corresponding to the case in which the cooperative behavior is very strong .",
    "for the cell model , we can derive @xmath85 and @xmath86 here @xmath87 and @xmath88 are constants and , in the mf context , @xmath89 .",
    "symbols @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is @xmath92 or @xmath93 , represent terms of order @xmath94 or higher , that are negligible when @xmath95 .",
    "our mf results confirm the relations in eq .",
    "( [ tc ] ) and ( [ pc ] ) , with @xmath96 and @xmath97 , with negligible @xmath90 terms .    therefore , we can rewrite the above relations as @xmath98 , when @xmath63 . as a consequence , for the case @xmath99 , we find @xmath100 , which is exactly what we find numerically in fig .  [ 2 ] along the line separating the llcp scenario with @xmath20 ( valid for @xmath101 ) and the llcp scenario with @xmath21 ( valid for @xmath102 ) .",
    "it is possible to show that eq .",
    "( [ pc ] ) can be generalized to @xmath103 , where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the @xmath18 and @xmath11 along the liquid  liquid transition line .",
    "our mf results are in good agreement with this prediction .",
    "we can estimate the equation of the line separating the llcp scenario with @xmath21 and the cpf / sl scenario in the @xmath64@xmath92 plane , by using the eq .",
    "( [ pc ] ) , together with the equation for the liquid  gas spinodal .",
    "in particular , we adopt a parametric fit , in terms of the parameter @xmath64 , of the spinodal pressure with respect to the spinodal temperature , and we evaluate the line separating the llcp and cpf / sl scenarios for @xmath106 when @xmath16 is on the spinodal . from this approximate approach , we derive that @xmath107 , with @xmath108 , of the same order of magnitude of the fitting parameter @xmath109 in fig .",
    "yet , @xmath110 , the value of @xmath111 in fig .  [ 2 ] , as a consequence of the strong approximations made .",

    "[ mc]c ) . for @xmath131 ,",
    "approaching zero , we find that the temperature of the hdl  ldl critical point approaches zero and the critical pressure increases toward the value @xmath132 independent of @xmath92 . in this case",

    "( [ pc ] ) still holds , but with @xmath133 .",
    "the line of @xmath5 maxima approaches the @xmath134 axis for @xmath135 .",
    "these results confirm the qualitative behavior found with the mf calculations .",
    "to show that our analysis offers a general framework within which to analyze the supercooled water phase diagram in terms of the interplay between the strengths of the directional contribution to the h bond interaction and its cooperative part , we compare our results with those from other thermodynamic models that can reproduce more than one scenario by tuning appropriate parameters @xcite .",
    "one free energy model with cooperative interactions is the one introduced by tanaka @xcite .",
    "he shows that , as in the sf scenario , water s anomalies are the effect of the excitation of locally favored structures upon cooling , which have lower energy and larger volume than normal - liquid structures . as in our model , in tanaka s model increasing the cooperativity among excitations of locally favored structures leads to the llcp scenario .",
    "moreover , tanaka s model llcp is regulated by relations such as our eq.([tc ] ) and ( [ pc ] ) .",
    "therefore , by increasing the strength of the cooperative interaction , the llcp will eventually reach the limit of stability of the liquid , as in the cpf / sl scenario .",
    "we next consider the free energy model introduced by poole et al .",
    "@xcite , in which a van der waals free energy is augmented to include the effect of h bond formation .",
    "the h bond interaction is characterized by two free parameters : the strength of the h bond , and a geometrical constraint on h bond formation .",
    "the fraction of molecules that form h bonds with decreased energy and entropy is determined by a distribution over molar volumes , the width of which is @xmath136 .",
    "poole et al .",
    "show that , by keeping @xmath136 fixed , their model displays a sl scenario for weak h bond energy , and a llcp at positive pressure for strong h bond energy .",
    "this corresponds in our model to increase the h bond coupling @xmath64 from @xmath137 to @xmath138 , while keeping @xmath139 fixed .",
    "next we study the effect of varying the other h bond parameter in the poole et al .",
    "model , the width @xmath136 . keeping the h bond energy fixed",
    ", we produce the llcp phase behavior at large @xmath136 and the sl phase behavior at small @xmath136 .",
    "hence a decrease of @xmath136 has the same effect on the phase diagram as an increase in the h bond cooperativity in our model .",
    "this result is consistent with that of borick et al .",
    "@xcite for their hamiltonian model that incorporates the cooperativity of h bonds trough the same mechanism used by poole et al . , i.e. by adopting a distribution with width @xmath136 that makes the h bond strength density dependent . by decreasing @xmath136 , borick et al .",
    "find that the llcp moves to lower @xmath11 and higher @xmath18 .",
    "this behavior makes sense physically , as a more all - or - nothing distribution of h bonds ( small @xmath136 ) implies a more cooperative process of bond formation .",
    "it also implies that the models of poole et al . and borick et al",
    ". give rise to the sf scenario only in the limiting case of infinite @xmath136 .",
    "we conclude that all four models give a consistent physical picture .",
    "this suggests that our result , expressed in terms of strength of the directional and cooperative components of the h bond , as summarized in fig .",
    "[ 2 ] , is general .",
    "in the framework of the scheme presented here , in which directionality and cooperativity are the two relvant physical parameters , we propose that the way to understand which scenario best describes water is to probe the energy of the covalent part of the h bond interaction  @xcite and the energy of the cooperative component of the h bond interaction  @xcite . experiments measure h bonds in ice ih to be approximately 3 kj / mol stronger than in liquid water  @xcite . attributing this increase to a cooperative interaction among h bonds  @xcite , we can estimate the value of @xmath57 in the cell model to be @xmath140 1.0 kj / mol .",

    "molecules ) , we derive the value for the directional component of the h bond , @xmath143 12.0 kj / mol .",
    "other experimental estimates suggest that breaking the directional component of the h bond requires @xmath140 6.3 kj / mol  @xcite .",
    "both estimates from experiments fall within the range of @xmath144 , with @xmath145 , i. e. with @xmath146 . therefore , within our model , these values lead to the llcp scenario with @xmath20 . in particular , mf calculations with @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 , predict a llcp at @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "we have shown that a microscopic cell model of water , by taking into account the cooperativity among h bonds , is able to produce phase behaviors consistent with any of the proposed scenarios for water s phase diagram .",
    "it is the amount of cooperativity in relation to the strength of the directional component of the h bond that establishes which scenario holds . for no amount of cooperativity",
    ", the sf scenario is recovered . by increasing the amount of cooperativity in relation to the h bond directional strength , a liquid ",
    "liquid transition grows out from the @xmath134 axis , ending in a llcp . with sufficiently strong cooperativity",

    "liquid transition , consistent with the cpf scenario . in this case",
    "the spinodal associated with the transition acts as the line predicted in the sl scenario .",
    "comparison with previous models gives consistent results .",
    "hence we argue that each of the four scenarios proposed for the phase diagram of liquid water may be viewed as a special case of our general scheme .",
    "this scheme is based on the assumption that water - water interaction is characterized by an isotropic component , a directional component and a cooperative component , and that h bond formation leads to an open local structure .",

    "<S> four scenarios have been proposed for the low  temperature phase behavior of liquid water , each predicting different thermodynamics . the physical mechanism which leads to each is debated . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is still unclear which of the scenarios best describes water , as there is no definitive experimental test . here </S>",
    "<S> we address both open issues within the framework of a microscopic cell model by performing a study combining mean field calculations and monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a common physical mechanism underlies each of the four scenarios , and that two key physical quantities determine which of the four scenarios describes water : ( i ) the strength of the directional component of the hydrogen bond and ( ii ) the strength of the cooperative component of the hydrogen bond . </S>",
    "<S> the four scenarios may be mapped in the space of these two quantities . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that our conclusions are model - independent . using estimates from experimental data for h bond properties </S>",
    "<S> the model predicts that the low - temperature phase diagram of water exhibits a liquid  liquid critical point at positive pressure .    </S>",
    "<S> water s phase diagram is rich and complex : more than sixteen crystalline phases @xcite , and two or more glasses @xcite have been reported . </S>",
    "<S> the liquid state also displays interesting behavior , such as the density maximum for 1 atm at @xmath0c . </S>",
    "<S> the volume fluctuations @xmath1 , entropy fluctuations @xmath2 , and cross - fluctuations between volume and entropy @xmath3 , proportional to the magnitude of isothermal compressibility @xmath4 , isobaric specific heat @xmath5 , and isobaric thermal expansivity @xmath6 , respectively , show anomalous increases in magnitude upon cooling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further , these quantities display an apparent divergence for 1 atm at @xmath7c @xcite , hinting at interesting phase behavior in the supercooled region .    </S>",
    "<S> microscopically , water s anomalous liquid behavior is understood as resulting from the tendency of neighboring molecules to form hydrogen ( h ) bonds upon cooling , with a decrease of local potential energy , decrease of local entropy , and increase of local volume due to the formation of local open structures of bonded molecules . </S>",
    "<S> different models include these h - bond features , but depending on the assumptions and approximations of each model , different conclusions are obtained for the low  t phase behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant region of the bulk liquid state can not be probed experimentally , and none of the theories tested , because crystallization of bulk water is unavoidable below the homogeneous nucleation temperature @xmath8 ( @xmath9c at 1  atm ) . </S>"
