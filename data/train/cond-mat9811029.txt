    "the investigation of nano - scale electronic devices , such as low - capacitance tunnel junctions or quantum dot systems , has always been motivated by the perspective of future applications . by now",
    "several have been demonstrated , e.g.  the use of single - electron transistors ( set ) as ultra - sensitive electro - meters and single - electron pumps . from the beginning it also appeared attractive to use these systems for digital operations needed in classical computation ( see ref .   for a review ) .",
    "obviously _ single - electron _ devices would constitute the ultimate electronic memory .",
    "unfortunately , their extreme sensitivity makes them also very susceptible to fluctuations and random background charges . due to these problems",
    " and the continuing progress of conventional techniques  the future of set devices in _ classical _ digital applications remains uncertain .",
    "the situation is different when we turn to elements for quantum computers .",
    "they could perform certain calculations which no classical computer could do in acceptable times by exploiting the quantum mechanical coherent evolution of superpositions of states  @xcite . here",
    "conventional systems provide no alternative . in this context , ions in a trap , manipulated by laser irradiation are the best studied system @xcite .",
    "however , alternatives need to be explored , in particular those which are more easily embedded in an electronic circuit . from this point of view nano - electronic devices appear particularly promising .    the simplest choice ,",
    "normal - metal single - electron devices are ruled out , since  due to the large number of electron states involved  different , sequential tunneling processes are incoherent",
    ". ultra - small quantum dots with discrete levels , and in particular , spin degrees of freedom embedded in nano - scale structured materials are candidates .",
    "they can be manipulated by tuning potentials and barriers  @xcite . however , these systems are difficult to fabricate in a controlled way . more attractive",
    "appear systems of josephson contacts , where the coherence of the superconducting state can be exploited and the technology is quite advanced .",
    "macroscopic quantum effects associated with the flux in a squid have been demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "quantum extension of elements based on single flux logic have been suggested  @xcite , and efforts are made to observe one of the elementary processes , the coherent oscillation of the flux between degenerate states  @xcite .",
    "we have suggested  @xcite to use low - capacitance josephson junctions , where cooper pairs tunnel coherently while coulomb blockade effects allow the control of individual charges .",
    "they provide physical realizations of quantum bits ( qubits ) with logical states differing by the number of cooper pair charges on an island .",
    "these junctions can be fabricated by present - day technology .",
    "the coherent tunneling of cooper pairs and the related properties of quantum mechanical superpositions of charge states have been discussed and demonstrated in experiments  @xcite . in particular , in a recent experiment  @xcite nakamura et  al . have observed time - resolved coherent oscillations of charge in such josephson junction setup .",
    "we concentrate here on the simplest design of the qubit , which is sufficient to introduce the ideas , and it is most easy for fabrication . it should be added that other ideas in this direction have been discussed  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite an improved design has been proposed that relaxes requirements to the parameters of the circuit and makes the manipulation procedures more flexible . in section  [ section_qubits ] we will introduce the system and show how single- and two - bit operations ( gates ) can be performed by the application of sequences of gate voltages . in section  [ section_dephasing ] we analyze the influence of dissipation and fluctuations and conclude that for a proper choice of parameters the phase coherence time is sufficiently long to allow a large number of gate operations .",
    "in addition to the controlled manipulations of qubits , quantum computation requires a quantum measurement process to read out the final state .",
    "the requirements for both steps appear to contradict each other . during manipulations",
    "the dephasing should be minimized , whereas a measurement should dephase the state of the qubit as fast as possible .",
    "the option to couple the measuring device to the qubit only when needed is hard to achieve in nano - scale systems .",
    "the alternative described in section  [ section_measurement ] , is to couple a normal - state single - electron transistor capacitively to a qubit  @xcite . during the manipulations the transport voltage of the set is turned off , and the set only acts as an extra capacitor . to perform the measurement the transport voltage is turned on .",
    "the dissipative current through the transistor dephases the qubit and provides the read - out signal for the quantum state .",
    "we describe this quantum measurement process by considering explicitly the time - evolution of the density matrix of the coupled system .",
    "we find that the process is characterized by three time scales : a short dephasing time , the longer ` measurement time ' when the signal resolves the different quantum states , and finally the mixing time after which the measurement process itself destroys the information about the initial state .",
    "similar nonequilibrium dephasing processes  @xcite have recently been demonstrated experimentally  @xcite .    in section  [ section_discussion ]",
    "we discuss system parameters and suggest suitable sets which can be realized by present - day technology .",
    "we further compare with related work .",
    "the simplest josephson junction qubit is shown in fig .",
    "[ bits_ideal]a .",
    "it consists of a small superconducting island connected by a tunnel junction , with capacitance @xmath0 and josephson coupling energy @xmath1 , to a superconducting electrode .",
    "an ideal voltage source , @xmath2 , is connected to the system via a gate capacitor @xmath3 ( fluctuation effects will be discussed later ) .",
    "we choose a material such that the superconducting energy gap @xmath4 is the largest energy in the problem , larger even than the single - electron charging energy to be discussed below . in",
    "this case quasi - particle tunneling is suppressed at low temperatures , and a situation can be achieved where no quasiparticle excitations exist on the island .",
    "this ` parity effect ' has been established in experiments below a crossover temperature @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the number of electrons in the system near the fermi energy  @xcite . for a small enough island , @xmath7 is typically one order of magnitude smaller than the superconducting transition temperature . for the case that  e.g.  due to the initial preparation  an unpaired excitation exists on the island , a channel should be provided for the quasiparticle to escape to normal parts of the system  @xcite . ] .",
    "= 14    0.8 cm    in the following we will consider the situation where only cooper pairs tunnel in the superconducting junction . this system is described by the hamiltonian @xmath8 here , @xmath9 is the number ( operator ) of extra cooper pair charges on the island ( relative to some neutral reference state ) and the phase variable @xmath10 is its conjugate @xmath11 . the charging energy of the superconducting island is characterized by the scale @xmath12 , while the dimensionless gate charge , @xmath13 , acts as a control field .",
    "we consider systems where @xmath14 is much larger than the josephson coupling energy , @xmath15 . in this regime",
    "a convenient basis is formed by the charge states , parameterized by the number of cooper pairs @xmath9 on the island . in this basis the hamiltonian ( [ 1bit_hamiltonian_eqb ] ) reads @xmath16    for most values of @xmath17 the energy levels are dominated by the charging part of the hamiltonian .",
    "however , when @xmath17 is approximately half - integer and the charging energies of two adjacent states are close to each other , the josephson tunneling mixes them strongly ( see fig .",
    "[ parabolas ] ) .",
    "= 10    0.8 cm    we concentrate on the voltage interval near a degeneracy point of two charge states , say @xmath18 and @xmath19 . for the parameters chosen",
    ", further charge states can be ignored , and the system ( [ 1bit_hamiltonian_eqb ] ) reduces to a two - state model , with hamiltonian which can be written in spin-@xmath20 notation in terms of pauli spin matrices @xmath21 as @xmath22 the charge states @xmath18 and @xmath19 correspond to the spin basis states @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the charging energy @xmath25 , equivalent to a magnetic field in @xmath26-direction in the spin problem , is controlled by the gate voltage . for convenience",
    "we can further rewrite the hamiltonian as @xmath27 where the mixing angle @xmath28 $ ] determines the direction of the effective magnetic field in the @xmath29-plane , and the energy splitting between the eigenstates is @xmath30 . at the degeneracy point ,",
    "@xmath31 , it reduces to @xmath1 .",
    "the eigenstates are denoted in the following as @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "for some chosen value of @xmath17 they are @xmath34    for later convenience we can rewrite the hamiltonian in the basis of eigenstates . to avoid confusion",
    "we introduce a second set of pauli matrices , @xmath35 , which operate in the basis @xmath32 and @xmath33 , while reserving @xmath36 for the basis of charge states @xmath37 and @xmath38 . by definition",
    "the hamiltonian then becomes @xmath39 .    by changing the gate voltage we can perform the required one - bit operations ( gates ) .",
    "if , for example , one chooses the idle state far away from degeneracy , the eigenstates @xmath32 and @xmath33 are close to @xmath40 and @xmath38 , respectively . for definiteness , we choose the eigenstates @xmath32 and @xmath33 at the idle point as logical basis states .",
    "then switching the system suddenly to the degeneracy point for a time @xmath41 and then switching back produces a rotation in spin space , @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath41 , a spin flip can be produced , or , starting from @xmath32 , a superposition of states with any chosen weights can be reached .",
    "this is exactly the way the experiments of nakamura  et  al .",
    "@xcite were performed . at the same time , keeping the system at the idle point we achieve a phase shift between two logical states by the angle @xmath44 .",
    "a different phase shift during the same time period @xmath41 can be achieved using a temporary change of @xmath17 by a small amount which changes the energy difference between the ground and excited states .",
    "the example presented above provides an approximate spin flip for the situation where the idle point is far from degeneracy and @xmath15 . but a spin flip in the logical basis can also be performed exactly .",
    "it requires that we switch from the idle point @xmath45 to the point where the effective magnetic field is orthogonal to the idle one , @xmath46 .",
    "this changes the hamiltonian from @xmath47 to @xmath48 . to achieve that , the dimensionless gate charge @xmath17",
    "should be increased by @xmath49 . in the limit",
    "discussed above , @xmath50 , the operating point is close to the degeneracy , @xmath51 .",
    "unitary @xmath52- and @xmath53-rotations described above are sufficient for all manipulations with a single qubit . by using a sequence ( of no more than three ) such elementary rotations we can achieve any unitary transformation of the qubit s state .    in our discussion",
    "so far elementary rotations should have been performed one immediately after another .",
    "however , sometimes the quantum state should be kept intact for a certain time interval , for instance , while other qubits are manipulated during the computation . even in the idle state",
    "@xmath54 , the energies of the two eigenstates are different .",
    "hence their phases evolve relative to each other , which leads to the quantum mechanical ` coherent oscillations ' of a system which is in a superposition of eigenstates .",
    "we have to keep track of this time dependence as is demonstrated by the following example ( for simplicity again on the approximate level ) .",
    "imagine we try to perform a rotation by angle @xmath55 in the spin space , which we can do by a suitable choice of @xmath41 in ( [ 1bit_spin_flip ] ) , and after some time delay @xmath56 we perform the reverse operation .",
    "the unitary transformation for this combined process is @xmath57 clearly the result depends on the intermediate time @xmath56 and differs from unity or a simple phase shift , unless @xmath58",
    ". the time - dependent phase factors , arising from the energy difference in the idle state , can be removed from the eigenstates if all the calculations are performed in the interaction representation , with zero - order hamiltonian being the one at the idle point . in this way the information which is contained in the amplitudes of the qubit s states",
    "is preserved .",
    "however , there is a price for this simplification , namely the transformation to the interaction representation introduces additional time dependence in the hamiltonian during the operations .",
    "thus a general 1-bit operation induced by switching at @xmath59 from @xmath45 to @xmath60 for some time @xmath41 is described by the unitary transformation @xmath61 this demonstrates that the effect of the operations depends not only on their time span but also on the moment when they start .",
    "the transformation ( [ ugeneral ] ) is the elementary operation in the interaction picture in the sense that it can be performed in one step ( one voltage switching ) .",
    "can we perform an arbitrary single - bit gate using such an operation ? to answer this question we note that all the unitary transformations of the two - state system form the group su(2 ) .",
    "the group is three - dimensional , hence one needs in general three controllable parameters to obtain a given single - bit operation .",
    "as is obvious from ( [ ugeneral ] ) , @xmath62 depends exactly on three parameters : @xmath60 , @xmath59 and @xmath41 .",
    "it can be shown that _ any _ single - bit gate can be performed in one step if the voltage ( i.e.  @xmath60 ) and the times @xmath59 , @xmath41 are chosen properly.- and @xmath26-rotations , as device - independent elementary single - qubit gates .",
    "then , any single - bit gate in a quantum algorithm is described as a combination of three consecutive elementary rotations given by their angles ( e.g.  euler angles",
    "@xmath55 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) . to realize such a gate",
    "@xmath65 we need to solve the equation @xmath66 to find the triple of @xmath60 , @xmath59 and @xmath41 .",
    "since usually only a few different single - bit gates are used , corresponding triples can be calculated in advance . ] ( the dependence on @xmath59 is periodic with the period @xmath67 . hence the waiting time to a new operation is restricted to this period . )    as a final remark in this subsection , we notice that our choice of the logical basis is by no means unique . as follows from the preceding discussion , we can perform @xmath68- and @xmath26-rotations in this basis , which provides sufficient tools for any unitary operation . on the other hand ,",
    "since we can perform _ any _ unitary transformation , we can as well perform @xmath68- and @xmath26-rotations in any basis of our two - dimensional system .",
    "therefore , any basis can serve as the logical one .",
    "the hamiltonian at the idle point is diagonal in the basis ( [ eigen_basis ] ) , while the controlled part of the hamiltonian , the charging energy favors the charge basis .",
    "for this reason manipulation procedures for @xmath68- and @xmath26-rotations , in the interaction representation , are of comparable simplicity in all bases . the preparation procedure ( thermal relaxation at the idle point )",
    "is easier described in the eigenbasis , while coupling to the meter ( see section  [ section_measurement ] ) is diagonal in the charge basis .",
    "so , there is no obvious choice for the logical states and it is a matter of convention .      for quantum computation a register , consisting of a ( large ) number of qubits is needed , and pairs of qubits have to be coupled in a controlled way .",
    "such two - bit operations ( gates ) are necessary , for instance , to create entangled states . for this purpose",
    "we couple all qubits by one mutual inductor as shown in fig .",
    "[ bits_ideal]b .",
    "one can easily see that for @xmath69 the system reduces to a series of uncoupled qubits , while for @xmath70 they are coupled strongly .",
    "finite values of @xmath71 introduce some retardation in the interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian of this system , consisting of @xmath72 qubits and an oscillator formed by the inductance and the total capacitance of all qubits is  @xcite @xmath73 here @xmath74 is the flux in the mutual inductor , @xmath75 is the flux quantum , and @xmath76 , the variable conjugated to @xmath74 , is related to the total charge on the gate capacitors of the qubits . for the oscillations in this @xmath77-circuit",
    "the junction and gate capacitor of each qubit act in series , hence the relevant capacitance is @xmath78 .",
    "the voltage oscillations of the @xmath77-circuit affect all the qubits equally , thus @xmath74 is coupled to each of the phases @xmath79 . the reduction factor",
    "@xmath80 describes the screening of these voltage oscillations by the gate capacitors .",
    "here we have chosen to express the coupling via a shift of the phase in the josephson coupling terms arising from the voltage oscillations .",
    "this form is reminiscent of the usual description of squids , except that @xmath74 is a dynamic variable and its effect is reduced by the ratio of capacitances .",
    "alternatively , we could have added the oscillating charges to the gate charges in the charging energy .",
    "both forms are equivalent and related by a canonical transformation . this and a more detailed derivation of ( [ 2bit_hamiltonian_cosine ] ) has been presented in ref .",
    "the oscillator described by the charge @xmath81 and flux @xmath74 with characteristic frequency @xmath82 produces an effective coupling between the qubits .",
    "we choose parameters such that @xmath83 the first condition ( [ high_frequency_condition ] ) assures that the oscillator remains in its ground state at all relevant operation frequencies .",
    "i.e.  the logical operations on the qubits are not affected by excited states . the second condition ( [ small_fluctuation_assumption ] )",
    "prevents the josephson coupling in ( [ 2bit_hamiltonian_cosine ] ) from being `` washed out '' by the fluctuations of @xmath74 .",
    "since they are limited by @xmath71 , hence @xmath84 , this condition imposes only weak constraints on the parameters .",
    "although the @xmath77-oscillator remains in its ground state , it provides an effective coupling between the qubits . to analyze this we expand in ( [ 2bit_hamiltonian_cosine ] ) the josephson coupling terms in @xmath74 and , because of ( [ small_fluctuation_assumption ] ) , neglect powers higher than linear .",
    "the linear term is @xmath85 , where the current through the inductor is given by the sum of qubits contributions , @xmath86 the linear term and the unperturbed hamiltonian of the oscillator can be combined to a square , @xmath87 as long as the frequency of the oscillator is large compared to characteristic frequencies of the qubit s motion ( [ high_frequency_condition ] ) , one can use the adiabatic approximation and treat the slow qubit s variables ( @xmath79 ) as constant to find the energy levels of the oscillator . since the lowest level of the first two terms in the rhs of eq.([perturbedham ] ) , equal to @xmath88 , does not depend on @xmath89 , the correction to the ground state energy is given by the last term .",
    "this term provides the effective coupling between the qubits @xmath90 where the energy scale is @xmath91 in the spin-@xmath20 notation @xmath92 and the interaction term becomes ( up to constant terms ) @xmath93    the ideal system would be one where the coupling between different qubits could be switched on and off , leaving the qubits uncoupled in the idle state and during 1-bit operations .",
    "this option requires a more complicated design  @xcite . with the present , simplest model the qubits",
    "are coupled at all times .",
    "but even in this case we can control the coupling in an approximate way by tuning the energies of the selected qubits in and out of resonance .",
    "if @xmath94 is smaller or comparable to @xmath1 and the gates voltages @xmath95 are all different , such that no two qubits are near a degeneracy , the interaction ( [ 2bit_spin_coupling ] ) has only weak effects . in this case , the eigenstates of , say , a two - qubit system are approximately @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , separated by energies larger than @xmath94 .",
    "hence , the effect of the coupling is weak . if , however , a pair of these states is degenerate , even a weak coupling lifts the degeneracy , changing the eigenstates drastically .",
    "for example , if @xmath100 , the states @xmath101 and @xmath102 are degenerate . in this case the correct eigenstates are : @xmath103 and @xmath104 with energy splitting @xmath94 between them .    with the coupling ( [ 2bit_spin_coupling ] )",
    "we are able to perform two - bit operations and create , e.g. , entangled states . in the idle state",
    "we bias all qubits at different voltages .",
    "then we suddenly switch the voltages of two selected qubits to be equal , bringing those two qubits for a time @xmath41 into resonance , and then we switch back .",
    "the result is a two - bit operation , which is a rotation in the subspace spanned by @xmath105 : @xmath106 where @xmath107 .",
    "the states @xmath108 merely acquire phase factors , relative to what they would acquire in the idle state . for all other qubits",
    "the interaction remains a small perturbation .",
    "similar to the situation with single - bit gates , the many - qubit states have time - dependent phase factors and the result of consecutive 2-bit gates depends on the waiting time between them .",
    "again a transformation to the interaction representation makes this time dependence explicit .",
    "one can show that any two - qubit operation can , in principle , be performed exactly .",
    "however , the complexity of such exact manipulation grows with the number of qubits .",
    "the improved design proposed in  @xcite allows one to switch on and off the coupling between the qubits and to perform exact two - qubit operations in a simple way .",
    "the two - bit gates ( [ 2bit_operation ] ) together with all one - bit gates , i.e.  spin rotations ( [ 1bit_spin_flip ] ) and the phase shifts , constitute a _",
    "universal set _ :",
    "they are sufficient for all manipulations required for quantum computation .      to check the experimental feasibility of the present proposal",
    "it is necessary to estimate the time - span @xmath41 of the voltage pulses needed for typical single - bit operations .",
    "we note that a reasonable value of @xmath1 is of the order of @xmath1091k .",
    "it can not be chosen much lower , since the condition @xmath110 should be satisfied , and it should not be much larger since this would increase the technical difficulties associated with the time control .",
    "the corresponding time - span is nevertheless short , @xmath111@xmath112ps , and is difficult to control in an experiment .",
    "there exist , however , alternatives . on one hand , a controlled ramping of the coupling energy",
    "provides a well defined , though non - trivial single - bit operation . since in general , any 1-bit gate can be performed with proper choice of 3 controlled parameters , a universal set of gates can be produced in this way .",
    "another possibility is to follow the established procedures of spin resonance experiments .",
    "e.g.  a coherent spin rotation can be performed as follows : the system is moved adiabatically to the degeneracy point . then an ac voltage with frequency @xmath113",
    "is applied . finally , the system is moved adiabatically back to the idle point .",
    "the time - width of the ac - pulse needed , e.g. , for a total spin flip depends on the ac - amplitude , therefore it can be chosen much longer then @xmath114 .",
    "unfortunately , in comparison to the sudden switching , the slow adiabatic approach allows only a reduced number of operations during the phase coherence time .",
    "also the two - bit gates , instead of application of short voltage pulses , can be performed by moving the system adiabatically to a degeneracy point ( say @xmath115 ) , and then applying an ac voltage pulse in the antisymmetric channel @xmath116 .    to improve",
    "the performance of the device generalizations of the design of the qubits and their coupling may be useful .",
    "we mention here one which has been described in ref .  .",
    "there we discuss a system where the josephson coupling can be tuned to zero as well .",
    "this can be achieved by replacing each josephson junction by a squid with two junctions , and controlling the effective coupling by an applied magnetic flux . while this design is more complicated to fabricate , it has considerable advantages : ( i ) in the idle state",
    "the hamiltonian can be tuned to zero ( @xmath117 ) , which removes the problem that the unitary transformations not only depend on the time span of their duration but also on the time @xmath59 when they are performed .",
    "( ii ) the two - bit coupling is turned on only for those two qubits which have both @xmath118 .",
    "( iii ) with only @xmath119 or @xmath120 non - zero , the unitary transformations depend in a simple way on the time integral of the corresponding hamiltonian . hence ramping the energies produces simple , well - defined gates . as a result of these improvements",
    "the manipulations can be performed with much higher accuracy .",
    "the idealized picture outlined above has to be extended to account for the possible dissipation mechanisms causing decoherence and relaxation .",
    "we focus on the dissipation and fluctuations which originate from the circuit of the voltage sources . in fig .",
    "[ bits_circuit ] the equivalent circuit of a qubit coupled to an impedance @xmath121 is shown .",
    "the latter is characterized by intrinsic voltage fluctuations ( between its terminals when disconnected from the circuit ) , with spectrum @xmath122 when @xmath121 is embedded in a circuit , similar to that of fig .",
    "[ bits_circuit ] but with @xmath123 , the voltage fluctuations between the terminals of @xmath121 are characterized by a modified spectrum : @xmath124 here @xmath125^{-1}$ ] is the total impedance between the terminals of @xmath121 .",
    "= 12    0.8 cm    following caldeira and leggett  @xcite we model the dissipative element @xmath121 by a bath of harmonic oscillators described by the hamiltonian @xmath126 \\ . \\label{bath_hamiltonian_xp}\\ ] ] it is assumed that the voltage between the terminals of @xmath121 is given by @xmath127 and the spectral function @xmath128 is chosen to reproduce the fluctuations spectrum ( [ dvdv_disconnected ] ) , @xmath129 .",
    "then , we embed the element @xmath121 in the qubit s circuit and we use the kirchhof constraints to derive the hamiltonian of the whole system . taking into account the possibility of a time - dependent external voltage @xmath130",

    "the environment has two effects : inelastic energy relaxation and dephasing , both characterized by their respective time scales , @xmath137 and @xmath138 . to illustrate this point we consider a qubit prepared in a superposition of eigenstates @xmath139 with non - vanishing coefficients @xmath140 and @xmath141",
    "this corresponds to an initial density matrix @xmath142 . in this case",
    ", one question is how fast the diagonal elements of the density matrix relax to their thermal equilibrium values .",
    "this relaxation is determined by @xmath143 .",
    "the second question is how fast the off - diagonal elements vanish , which is governed by the rate @xmath144 . in general , the two rates are not equal .",
    "both inelastic transitions and dephasing were addressed in the context of spin - boson models , in particular for a two - level system with purely ohmic dissipation @xcite .",
    "our system ( [ disshamusualform ] ) reduces to a spin - boson model in the limit where only two charge states need to be considered , with a harmonic oscillator bath coupling to @xmath145 . it still differs from an ohmic model due to the frequency dependence in the function @xmath146 .",
    "however , for the relevant frequencies , @xmath147 , the physics is dominated by the resistor .",
    "hence we can take over the results from the model calculations of refs .   for purely ohmic environments .",
    "the strength of the fluctuations and , hence , the relaxation and dephasing effects are controlled by the resistance of the circuit .",
    "it turns out that it has to be measured in units of the quantum resistance @xmath148k@xmath149 .",
    "hence for low circuit resistances in the range of @xmath150 we can expect a weak effect .",
    "furthermore , in our system the effect of fluctuation is reduced due to the weak capacitive coupling of the qubit to the circuit . indeed , as is apparent from ( [ disshamusualform ] ) the coupling of @xmath151 to the qubit s charge @xmath9 involves the ratio @xmath152 .",
    "thus , the relevant parameter characterizing the effect of the voltage fluctuations is @xmath153 .    in ref .",
    "only the unbiased case of the spin - boson model , corresponding to the qubit at the degeneracy point @xmath154 , has been analyzed rigorously in the limit of low dissipation ( the only limit relevant for the quantum computation ) .",
    "the biased case of the spin - boson model at low dissipation ( i.e.  the qubit out of the degeneracy ) was treated in ref .  .",
    "the two rates , expressed in terms of the mixing angle introduced in ( [ eigen_basis ] ) , are @xmath155 and @xmath156 we note that out of the degeneracy the dephasing rate acquires a component proportional to the temperature .",

    "the second eigenvalue @xmath329 is small , and the corresponding eigenmode , with @xmath330 , survives .",

    "the factor @xmath333 ( see e.g. ref .  ) varies between @xmath334 in the symmetric situation ( @xmath335 ) and @xmath336 in the extremely asymmetric case ( @xmath337 much larger or much smaller than @xmath338 ) .",
    "analogously the second group of equations for @xmath339 and @xmath340 describe a wave packet which moves in @xmath216-direction with the group velocity @xmath341 and the width growing as @xmath342 .",
    "the two peaks correspond to the qubit in the states @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "they separate when their distance is larger than their widths , i.e.@xmath343 .",
    "this means that after the time @xmath344 which we denote as the measurement time , the process can constitute a quantum measurement .    to learn about the dephasing we analyze the last four equations of ( [ me8by8 ] ) at @xmath345 , which is equivalent to a trace over @xmath216 .",
    "these four equations may be recombined into two complex ones : @xmath346 the analysis of this set shows that if @xmath347 the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are @xmath348 and @xmath349 . in the opposite limit @xmath350 the imaginary parts are @xmath351 and @xmath352 .",
    "the first limit is physically more relevant ( we assume parameters in this regime ) , although the second one is also possible if the tunneling is very weak or the coupling between the qubit and the set transistor is strong . in both limits the dephasing time , which is defined as the the longer of the two times , @xmath353^{-1 } , [ { \\rm im}\\,\\omega_2]^{-1}\\}\\ ] ] is parametrically different from the measurement time ( [ measurement_time ] ) . in the first limit , @xmath354",
    ", it is @xmath355 one can check that in the whole range of validity of our approach the measurement time exceeds the dephasing time , @xmath356 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that a `` good '' quantum measurement should completely dephase a quantum state .",
    "the reason for the difference between the measurement time and the dephasing time is the entanglement of the qubit s state with additional microscopic states of the set ,  states which can not be characterized by the number of electrons which have tunneled through the transistor , @xmath216 , only .",
    "imagine that we know ( with high probability ) that during some time from the beginning of the measurement process exactly one electron has tunneled through the set whatever the qubit s state was .",
    "does it mean that with that high probability there was no dephasing ?",
    "the answer is no .",
    "the transport of electrons occurs via a real state of the island , @xmath293 .",
    "the system may spend different times in this intermediate state , i.e. different phase shifts are acquired between the two states of the qubit . since the time spent in the state @xmath293 is actually random , some dephasing has occurred . next we can ask where the information about this phase uncertainty is stored , i.e. which states has the qubit become entangled with .",
    "these may not be the states with different @xmath216 or @xmath72 since @xmath216 is equal to one and @xmath72 is again equal to zero irrespective of the state of the qubit .",
    "the only possibility are the microscopic states of the middle island and/or leads , which were subject to different time evolutions during different histories of the tunneling process . to put it in the language of ref .",
    ", the initial state of the system @xmath357 evolves into @xmath358 , where @xmath359 stands for the quantum state of the uncontrolled environment .",
    "one may imagine a situation when @xmath360 , but @xmath361 and @xmath362 are orthogonal .",
    "in this situation the dephasing has occurred but no measurement has been performed .",
    "dephasing was also analyzed in refs .  .",
    "in these works a quantum point contact ( qpc ) measuring device was used only as a source of dephasing , i.e.  the information on the current flowing in the measuring device was disregarded .",
    "thus a distinction between measurement and dephasing was not made .",
    "however the expressions for the dephasing time were given by expressions similar to ( [ measurement_time ] ) .",
    "as it became clear later @xcite , the qpc does not involve an additional uncontrolled environment during the measurement process and , therefore , @xmath363 .",
    "indeed , the tunneling in the qpc does not occur via a real intermediate state and the discussion above does not apply . in this sense",
    "the qpc may be regarded as a @xmath364 efficient measuring device .",
    "the additional environment in the set , which , as mentioned , reduces the efficiency of the measuring device , plays , actually , a positive role in the quantum measurement , provided it dephases the state of the qubit only when the system is driven out of equilibrium .",
    "this is because the quicker dephasing suppresses the transitions between the states of the qubit ( such a suppression of the transitions due to a continuous observation of the quantum state of the system is called the zeno effect ) , while the initial probabilities are preserved .",
    "it is worth noting that a set might also be used as a @xmath364 efficient device , if it was biased in the co - tunneling regime .",
    "however , this possibility has other drawbacks and hence is not considered here further .      finally , we analyze what happens if we take into account the mixing terms proportional to @xmath1 in the system ( [ me8by8 ] ) .",
    "we consider @xmath345 and investigate the eigenvalues of the @xmath365 matrix ( [ matrix_8by8 ] ) .",
    "note that in the discussion above we have calculated all the eight eigenvalues for @xmath163 ( the two eigenvalues of the complex system ( [ cd_subsystem ] ) are doubled when one considers it as a system of four real equations ) . in the diagonal part",
    "there were two zeros , which corresponded to two conserved quantities ( for @xmath345 ) , @xmath366 and @xmath367 .",
    "six other eigenvalues were large compared to the amplitudes of the mixing terms .",
    "it is clear , that including the mixing , @xmath368 , changes only slightly the values of the six large eigenvalues .",
    "a more pronounced effect may be expected in the subspace of the two degenerate eigenvectors with zero eigenvalues .",
    "it turns out that this degeneracy is lifted in second order of perturbation theory .",
    "one of the resulting eigenvalues remains zero .",
    "this corresponds to the conservation of the total trace @xmath369 .",
    "the second eigenvalue acquires now a small imaginary part and this gives the time scale of the mixing between the two states of the qubit . in the limit of ( our ) interest we obtain @xmath370 where @xmath371 , and @xmath372 . comparing eq .",
    "( [ mixing_time ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ measurement_time ] ) we see that both cases @xmath373 and @xmath374 are possible .",
    "let us analyze a concrete physical situation .",
    "we assume @xmath375 .",
    "we choose @xmath376 far enough from the degeneracy point , which is @xmath377 , so that @xmath378 and the related coulomb blockade energy , @xmath379 , is of the order of @xmath380 . to satisfy the conditions for the golden rule ( see ( [ left_rate_laplace ] ) and the discussion thereafter ) we assume @xmath381 to be the largest energy scale of the system , @xmath382 , and the chemical potential of the left lead , @xmath383 , to exceed the coulomb blockade energy by an amount of the order of @xmath381 .",
    "the transport voltage should not , however , exceed the value beyond which further charge states of the set transistor , e.g.  @xmath384 and @xmath385 , become involved . thus @xmath386 and @xmath376 should be chosen far enough from zero as well .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath387 }           \\ .\\ ] ] the measurement time in the same regime is given approximately by @xmath388 for comparison we also give a rough value for the dephasing time , which is short when the measurement is performed .",
    "we assume the regime in which eq .",
    "( [ dephasing_time ] ) is valid .",
    "then @xmath389 note that the limit @xmath390 is not allowed in ( [ dephase_time_approx ] ) , since the validity of ( [ dephasing_time ] ) eventually breaks down in this limit .",
    "thus , @xmath391}\\right]^2 \\ .\\ ] ] one recognizes two competing ratios here : @xmath392 , which is small , and @xmath393 $ ] , which is large .",
    "the condition @xmath394 , thus , imposes an additional constraint on the parameters of the system . on the other hand , for low conductance barriers in the set ( @xmath395 but not too small ) ,",
    "the dephasing time is always shorter than the measurement time .",
    "let us summarize what has been done thus far : to measure the quantum state of the qubit we attach a set to the qubit and consider the time evolution of the whole system .",
    "we provide two complimentary descriptions of the measurement process . in the first we trace over the set s degrees of freedom and",
    "obtain a reduced density matrix of the qubit . from the time evolution of the last we deduce the dephasing time and the mixing time , i.  e.  the relaxation times for the off - diagonal and the diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix respectively .",
    "this description does not , however , contain information about the measurable quantity , the current in the set .",
    "therefore , in a second description , we calculate the probability distribution , @xmath320 , of the number of electrons @xmath216 which have passed through the set during time @xmath242 .",
    "we will evaluate @xmath320 numerically for parameters to be specified in the next section .",
    "the results , shown in fig .  [ plot0.1 ] and  [ plot0.3 ] , display the time evolution on the time scale of @xmath396 , relevant for the measurement process .",
    "we observe that under appropriate conditions @xmath320 splits into two separate peaks , whose weights are given by the initial probabilities of the eigenstates of the qubit .",
    "the splitting time is the minimum time after which one can distinguish between the states of the qubit and we call it , therefore , the measurement time , @xmath396 . the measurement time turns out to be longer than the dephasing time .",
    "this fact indicates that the state of the qubit gets entangled not only with the transport degree of freedom in the set but also with other , microscopic degrees of freedom which we do not observe  @xcite .",
    "note , that the knowledge of @xmath320 does not provide immediately the value of the current flowing in the set at all times .",
    "recently , attempts have been made to describe the measurement process in terms of the current in the measuring device @xcite .",
    "however , further investigation of this problem is definitely needed .",
    "to demonstrate that the constraints on the circuit parameters can be met by available technology , we summarize the constraints and suggest a suitable set .",
    "the necessary conditions are : @xmath397 .",
    "the temperature has to be chosen low to assure the initial thermalization , @xmath398 and @xmath399 , and to reduce the dephasing effects .",
    "a good choice is @xmath400 since further cooling would not decrease the dephasing rate at the degeneracy point much further .",
    "then , the dephasing rates during operations ( at the degeneracy point ) and in the idle state ( off degeneracy ) are close to each other .",
    "depending on the parameters chosen , the number of qubits @xmath72 and the total computation time are restricted .",
    "the dephasing times limits the number of operations to @xmath401 .",
    "this is the only restriction for a single qubit . if several qubits are coupled , the dephasing for the whole system is faster .",
    "since the sources of dissipation for different qubits are independent , the dephasing time gets @xmath72 times shorter . in addition",
    ", the energy splittings of the qubits should fit into the range provided by eq .",
    "( [ high_frequency_condition ] ) , and the levels within this range should be sufficiently different from each other to minimize the errors introduced by non - zero inter - qubit coupling between 2-bit operations ( cf . section  [ section_qubits ] ) .",
    "this provides a restriction on the number of qubits and the number of operations which can be performed . with circuit parameters discussed below and for",
    "not too many qubits these restrictions are weaker than those provided by the dephasing .",
    "moreover , we note that these restrictions are removed if the interaction is effectively turned off .",
    "this can be achieved on the `` software '' level , by the use of refocusing voltage pulses . on the `` hardware '' level this",
    "is achieved with the improved design suggested in ref .  .",
    "this allows for larger numbers of qubits and longer computations .    as an example we suggest a system with the following parameters : + ( i ) we choose junctions with the capacitance @xmath402f , corresponding to the charging energy ( in temperature units ) @xmath403k , and a smaller gate capacitance @xmath404f to reduce the coupling to the environment .",
    "thus at the working temperature of @xmath405mk the initial thermalization is assured .",
    "the superconducting gap has to be slightly larger @xmath406 .",
    "we further choose @xmath407mk , i.e.  the time scale of one - qubit operations is @xmath408s .",
    "+ ( ii ) we assume that the resistor in the gate voltages circuit has @xmath409 .",
    "voltage fluctuations limit the dephasing time ( [ gamma_phi_weiss ] ) .",
    "we thus arrive at an estimate of the decoherence rate which allows for @xmath410 coherent operations for a single bit .",
    "+ ( iii ) to assure sufficiently fast 2-bit operations we choose @xmath411h .",
    "then , the decoherence time is @xmath412 times longer than a 2-bit operation . in table",
    "[ tab_alternative_sets ] we present alternative sets of parameters , assuming throughout that the resistance is fixed as @xmath413 .",
    "the quantum measurement process introduces additional constraints on the parameters . in order to demonstrate that the conditions assumed in this paper are realistic we chose the charging energies @xmath198 , @xmath14 and @xmath199 as follows : the capacitance of the josephson junction is @xmath414f , the gate capacitance of the qubit @xmath415f , the capacitances of the normal tunnel junctions of the set @xmath416f , the gate capacitance of the set @xmath417f , and the capacitance between the set and the qubit @xmath418f . we obtain : @xmath419k , @xmath420k , @xmath421k .",
    "taking @xmath422 , @xmath423 and @xmath424k we get @xmath425k , @xmath426k , and @xmath427k ( for definitions see subsection [ subsection_mixing_time ] ) .",
    "we also assume @xmath428 .",
    "the measurement time in this regime is @xmath429s . for this choice of parameters",
    "we calculate @xmath430 using eq .",
    "( [ mixing_time ] ) . assuming first @xmath431k we obtain @xmath432s .",
    "thus @xmath433 and the separation of peaks should occur much earlier than the transitions happen .",
    "indeed , the numerical simulation of the system ( [ me8by8 ] ) for those parameters given above shows almost ideal separation of peaks ( see fig .",
    "[ plot0.1 ] ) . on the other hand , for @xmath434k , and we obtain @xmath435 . this is a marginal situation . the numerical simulation in this case ( see fig .",
    "[ plot0.3 ] ) shows that the peaks , first , start to separate , but , later , the valley between the peaks is filled due to the mixing transitions .",
    "these numbers demonstrate that the quantum manipulations of josephson junction qubits , as discussed in this paper , can be tested experimentally using the currently available lithographic and cryogenic techniques .",
    "we have further demonstrated that the current through a single - electron transistor can serve as a measurement of the quantum state of the qubit , in the sense that in the case of a superposition of two eigenstates it gives one or the other result with the appropriate probabilities .",
    "the demonstration that the qubit is in a superposition of eigenstates should be distinguished from another question , namely whether it is possible to verify that an eigenstate of a qubit is actually a superposition of two different charge states , which depends on the mixing angle @xmath60 as described by eq.([n_operator ] ) .",
    "this question has been addressed in the experiments of ref .  .",
    "they used a setup similar to the one shown in fig .",
    "[ circuit ] , a single - cooper - pair box coupled to a single - electron transistor .",
    "they could demonstrate that the expectation value of the charge in the box varies continuously as a function of the applied gate voltage as follows from ( [ n_operator ] ) .",
    "another experiment along the same lines has been performed by nakamura et al .",
    "they demonstrated by spectroscopy that the energy of the ground state and of the first excited state have the expected gate - voltage dependence of superpositions of charge states .",
    "our theory can also describe stationary - state measurements of ref .  .",
    "the measurement was performed in the whole range of voltages including the vicinity of the degeneracy point , and we need a different pertrubation expansion which is valid in this region  @xcite . for this purpose",
    "we have to analyze the rates in the master equation ( [ master_equation_final ] ) for general values of the mixing angle @xmath60 , relaxing the requirement @xmath436 . to this end we rewrite the master equation ( [ matrix_8by8 ] ) in the qubit s eigenbasis ( [ eigen_basis ] ) and consider the mixing terms as a perturbation .",
    "then , the expansion parameter is @xmath437 which extends the region of the validity of the perturbative treatment .",
    "it turns out that each eigenstate of the qubit , @xmath32 or @xmath33 , corresponds to a single , though @xmath60-dependent tunneling rate @xmath438 .",
    "thus , if the qubit is prepared in one of its eigenstates , only one peak is observed .",
    "this is the case even close to the degeneracy point @xmath439 where the eigenstates are superpositions of two charge states with substantial weight of both components . on the other hand a charge state ,",
    "being a superposition of two eigenstates , would produce two peaks in the current distribution .",
    "in this sense the measurement provides information about occupation probabilities of the eigenstates rather than charge states of the qubit .",
    "the correction to the tunneling rate @xmath440 is proportional to the average charge in the corresponding eigenstate of the qubit , in accordance with the experiments of bouchiat et al .",
    "close to the degeneracy it is more difficult ( takes longer ) to distinguish the eigenstates since the peaks get closer .    in our solution of the master equation we neglected dissipative effects due to the environment discussed in section  [ section_dephasing ] .",
    "it is justified on time scales shorter than the environment - induced relaxation and dephasing times given by ( [ gamma_r_weiss ] ) , ( [ gamma_phi_weiss ] ) .",
    "it is also justified at longer times as long as the environment - induced effects are weaker than the measurement - induced mixing , i.e. the rates ( [ gamma_r_weiss ] ) , ( [ gamma_phi_weiss ] ) are smaller than the mixing rate ( [ mixing_time ] ) . in this limit thermal relaxation is ineffective , and in the stationary regime ( @xmath441 ) the qubit is in the equally - weighted mixture of two states , corresponding to the infinite effective temperature .",
    "the current in the set , @xmath442 , is insensitive to the gate voltage in the qubit s circuit . in the opposite limit of weaker mixing , which is relevant to the experiments of bouchiat  et  al .",
    "@xcite , mixing is ineffective and thermal relaxation takes over . at low temperature @xmath443 dissipation",
    "keeps the system in the ground state , and the stationary current value is @xmath444 .",
    "it is also interesting to compare our proposal with the `` quantum jumps '' technique employed in quantum optics in general , and with the realizations of the qubits by trapped ions in particular ( for a review see ref .  )",
    "indeed , the concepts are very close in spirit : the state of the system is examined by an external nonequilibrium current ( electrons in our case and photons in the quantum jumps technique ) .",
    "there is , however , an important difference . in the quantum jumps measurements only one of the logical states scatters photons",
    "therefore , the efficiency of the measurement is limited by the ability to detect photons . in principle",
    "we could realize this situation also in our system , if we bias the set transistor such that different states of the qubit switch the transistor between the off and on regimes .",
    "then the efficiency of the measurement is determined by the ability to detect individual electron  which is possible in single - electron devices , for instance by charging a single - electron box  and the measurement time would be given by the time it takes the first electron to tunnel . however",
    ", this mode of operation would require that the set transistor is kept near the switching point , where thermal fluctuations and higher order processes could modify the picture substantially .",
    "therefore , we have concentrated here on a situation in which the set transistor conducts for both states of the qubit , and the measurement requires distinguishing large numbers of charges or macroscopic currents .",
    "accordingly , the measurement time is limited by the shot noise .",
    "to conclude , the fabrication of josephson junction qubits is possible with current technology . in these systems",
    "fundamental features of macroscopic quantum - mechanical systems can be explored .",
    "more elaborate designs as well as further progress of nano - technology , will provide longer coherence times and allow scaling to larger numbers of qubits .",
    "the application of josephson junction systems as elements of a quantum computer , i.e.  with a very large number of manipulations and large number of qubits , will remain a challenging issue , demanding in addition to the perfect control of time - dependent gate voltages a still longer phase coherence time .",
    "we stress , however , that many aspects of quantum information processing can initially be tested on simple circuits as proposed here .",
    "we have further shown that a single - electron transistor capacitively coupled to a qubit may serve as a quantum measuring device in an accessible range of parameters .",
    "we have described the process of measurement by deriving the time evolution of the reduced density matrix .",
    "we found that the dephasing time is shorter than the measurement time , and we have estimated the mixing time , i.e. the time scale on which the transitions induced by the measurement occur .",
