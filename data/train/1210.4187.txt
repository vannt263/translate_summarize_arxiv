    "the structure of the broad - line region ( blr ) in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is still poorly understood . a widely accepted concept , predicted from photoionization models @xcite and supported by reverberation mapping observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is that the blr is radially stratified : high - ionization lines are emitted from smaller radii than low - ionization lines .",
    "high - ionization lines such as c iv  are thought to be emitted , at least in part , from an outflow ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , while low - ionization lines such as h@xmath0  originate from a virialized region .",
    "it is the virialized component that is pertinent to efforts to use the blr to estimate the mass of the central black hole ( bh ) .",
    "however , velocity - resolved reverberation data from recent monitoring programs indicate that h@xmath0-emitting region is more complicated than previously thought ; depending on the object , infall , outflow , and virialized motions are all possible ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the profile of the broad h@xmath0  line also points to the complexity of the h@xmath0-emitting region .",
    "it generally can not be well described by a single gaussian . two gaussians ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or a gaussian - hermite function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are often used for quasars , while a lorentzian , a lorentzian plus a very broad gaussian ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or two gaussians ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are used for narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "in addition , the h@xmath0  profile shows great diversity from object to object ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . some previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) propose a two - component model for h@xmath0  emission , an intermediate - width component and a very broad component .",
    "netzer & marziani s ( 2010 ) calculations of the line profile rule out simple single - zone models .",
    "@xcite systematically investigated fe ii  and h@xmath0  emission in a large sample of quasars selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) .",
    "they found that fe ii  emission originates from an intermediate - velocity region , located farther out from the center , whose dynamics may be dominated by infall .",
    "the broad h@xmath0  line can be decomposed into two physically distinct components , one associated with the conventional blr and another with the intermediate - velocity region identified through fe ii .",
    "@xcite calculated the outward emission from infalling clouds and found that such a scenario can reproduce the observed fe ii  emission .",
    "these studies demonstrate that fruitful insights can be gained from a self - consistent investigation of the kinematics of different emission lines .    however , all the above work suffers from a major drawback : the derived parameters for both the continuum and the emission lines are model - dependent .",
    "the profiles of the emission lines are not necessarily well represented by the simple analytical functions ( gaussians , lorentzians , gauss - hermite polynomials , or various combinations thereof ) that are commonly used to fit them .",
    "spectral principal component analysis is an alternative , model - independent approach that can be used to study emission - line profiles .",
    "this method makes use use of all the emission features in the spectra , and it is well - suited for application to large data sets , such as that afforded by sdss .      principal component analysis ( pca )",
    "is a powerful mathematical tool used to reduce the dimensionality of a data set .",
    "it describes the variation in the data set by the fewest number of variables , called principal components ( pcs ) .",
    "the method has been widely used for many purposes in many areas of astronomy , including studies on agns .",
    "the most common implementation is to apply it to a set of measured variables and seek correlations among them .",
    "* hereinafter bg92 ) applied it to the palomar - green sample of low - redshift quasars and discovered that the bulk of the variance in the sample is dominated by the inverse correlation between the strengths of the fe ii  and [ o iii ]  lines , commonly called eigenvector 1 ( ev1 ) .",
    "although applying pca to a set of measured variables is suitable for multivariate correlation analysis , it has the shortcoming that measuring the input variables is itself model - dependent .",
    "the parameters of emission lines are often measured from fits using mathematically convenient functions .",
    "some parameters , such as the shape and asymmetry , can be quantified without fitting the line , but fitting the continuum and fe ii  emission first is always necessary .",
    "this shortcoming can be mitigated by spectral principal component analysis ( spca ) .    in spca , originally developed by @xcite , instead of using measured variables , the fluxes in each wavelength bin are used as input variables .",
    "spca obviates the need to model the continuum , the pseudocontinuum ( due to blended fe ii  emission ) , or the line profiles .",
    "the resultant pcs are linear combinations of the fluxes in each wavelength bin , so have the form of spectra and are represented as eigenspectra hereafter .",
    "spca has been used very successfully in classification ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the two - component structure of the h@xmath0  blr suggested by our spca results is relevant to bh mass estimates using the h@xmath0line width .",
    "this issue will be investigated in a third paper .",
    "we use the sample defined in @xcite as the parent sample .",
    "it is the largest sample to date that has measurements of fe ii  velocity shifts .",
    "the parent sample was selected from the sdss fifth data release ( dr5 ; @xcite ) quasar catalog @xcite according to a series of criteria that ensure that reliable measurements can be obtained for fe iiemission .",
    "briefly , the selection criteria include : ( 1 ) redshift @xmath4 and signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) @xmath5 in the wavelength range 44305550  ; ( 2 ) @xmath6  @xmath7 in their continuum decomposition ; ( 3 ) equivalent width ( ew ) of fe",
    "ii  @xmath8  ; ( 4 ) the h@xmath0  broad component fwhm errors @xmath9% and [ o iii ]  @xmath105007 peak velocity shift errors @xmath11100 @xmath3 .",
    "many nonlinear factors in spca have been studied in the literature .",
    "variable line width is one of them .",
    "the line center and wing have opposite responses when varying only the line width .",
    "its influence on spca has been studied extensively using simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it produces the characteristic fourier - like `` w '' shape on eigenspectra , a feature that has been seen in the majority of spca studies on quasar spectra .",
    "another nonlinear factor that contributes to the variance of quasar spectra is the variable slope of the power - law continuum .",
    "@xcite studied the influence of the continuum slope and found that it introduces cross talk among eigenspectra , which manifests as the appearance of a spectral feature ( e.g. , an emission line ) on an eigenspectrum with which it does not correlate .",
    "the nonlinear effects caused by these variable parameters can be mitigated by judiciously selecting subsamples in which these parameters ( e.g. , h@xmath0  line width ) span a narrow range of values .",
    "however , as discussed in  [ sec - introhb ] , the h@xmath0  profile is too complicated to be described by a single width parameter .",
    "moreover , one of our primary goals is to study the h@xmath0  profile itself , and it would be counterproductive to restrict our sample using the very parameter we wish to investigate . we could attempt to subtract the power - law continuum first , but this , too , is not ideal because the continuum can not be measured in a model - independent manner , thereby compromising the advantages to be gained by spca .",
    "the spectra of quasars also vary in the velocity shifts of emission lines .",
    "broad quasar emission lines often show considerable velocity shifts with respect to narrow emission lines @xcite .",
    "the velocity shift varies from source to source and from line to line ( see , e.g. , introduction section of @xcite for a brief review ) .",
    "@xcite systematically investigated the optical fe ii  emission in a large sample of quasars selected from sdss , and found that the velocity shifts of fe ii  emission span over a wide range .",
    "the majority of quasars show fe ii  emission that is redshifted by @xmath12 0 to 1000 @xmath3 , some up to 2000 @xmath3 , with respect to the velocity of the narrow - line region as traced by [ o iii ]  @xmath105007 or @xmath103727 ( see figure 7 of @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite called into question the measurement of fe iivelocity shifts in @xcite by testing the composite spectra of some subsamples .",
    "they claimed that the fe ii  emission in their composite spectra do not show significant .",
    "they claimed that the shift is not distinguishable from zero by adopting the criterion that @xmath13 should be larger than 1.24 .",
    "their criterion is much too severe than that derived from @xmath14-test of an additional term ( free versus fixed fe ii  velocity shift ) in the fitting .",
    "see appendix [ app - feschi ] for details . ]",
    "velocity shifts , and concluded that there is no evidence for a systematic fe ii  redshift .",
    "they preferred the older conclusion that the velocity shift and width of fe ii  follow those of h@xmath0  in virtually all sources .",
    "however , the properties of a composite spectrum depend on how the subsample is selected .",
    "contrary to the composite spectra in @xcite defined by their 4d eigenvector 1 formalism , the composite spectra of quasars in bins of different fe ii  velocity shifts generated in @xcite _ do _ show significantly redshifted fe ii  emission .",
    "appendix [ app - feschi ] gives details .",
    "the results from composite spectra in appendix [ app - feschi ] provide additional evidence that the fe ii  velocity shift measurements in @xcite are reliable for the majority of sources .",
    "the velocity shift of the emission line is a promising nonlinear factor , but one that has been overlooked in previous spca studies .",
    "prior to any analysis , all the spectra have been deredshifted to their rest frame .",
    "if the sources have different intrinsic velocity shifts , the effect on spca is equivalent to a situation in which the sources have no velocity shifts but their spectra are deredshifted using the _ wrong _ redshifts .",
    "both cases will confuse the resultant eigenspectra , rendering any simple interpretation impossible .",
    "this effect can be avoided if we restrict the variance of the velocity shifts in the sample to be small  much smaller than the widths of the broad emission lines . as this condition",
    "is satisfied by the narrow lines and broad balmer lines in the optical spectra of quasars , it is reasonable that previous spca studies did not take velocity shifts into consideration .",
    "fe ii  emission , which had not been well studied , was simply assumed to have no large velocity shift .",
    "but , as mentioned above , the dispersion in fe ii  emission shifts is comparable to the full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the line ( median value @xmath12 2500 @xmath3 ; figure 8 of @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the velocity shift of optical fe ii  emission _ can not _ be ignored in spca .    to summarize this subsection : the variance in fe ii  emission velocity shifts in quasars is an important nonlinear factor .",
    "it must be treated carefully in any spca study . to minimize the adverse effects of this nonlinear factor ,",
    "we will construct subsamples in which fe ii  emission has similar velocity shifts .",
    "we select the primary sample for spca from the parent sample using the following additional criteria .",
    "( 1 ) we choose objects with @xmath15 in order to obtain eigenspectra covering the rest - frame wavelength range 35005500  .",
    "the red end ensures that we include the fe ii  emission redward of [ o iii]@xmath105007 in the eigenspectra .",
    "( 2 ) the velocity shifts of fe ii  emission are in the range @xmath16250 to 250 @xmath3 , to ensure that the influence of this nonlinear factor can be suppressed .",
    "( 3 ) following @xcite , we select spectra that have no more than 100 pixels flagged as bad by the sdss pipeline in the rest - frame wavelength range 35005500  .",
    "the final primary sample for spca contains 816 sources , all of which have small fe ii  velocity shifts .",
    "the fe ii  velocity shift limits adopted in criterion ( 2 ) above follows that for subsample a in  4.6 of @xcite .",
    "four other bins of fe ii  velocity shift were use in @xcite ( see their figure 12 ) . in this paper",
    ", we also establish four other subsamples for spca , to explore the consequences of varying the velocity shift criterion , while keeping the other criteria unchanged .",
    "the number of sources in the other four subsamples are 794 ( b , 250750 @xmath3 ) , 338 ( c , 7501250 @xmath3 ) , 203 ( d , 12501750 @xmath3 ) , and 110 ( e , 17502250 @xmath3 ) .",
    "the results of spca for the four bins with large fe ii  velocity shifts are presented only in  [ sec - ovbin ] . unless otherwise noted , the spca results in this paper refers to the primary sample of 816 quasars with fe ii  velocity shift in the range @xmath16250 to 250 @xmath3  ( sample a ) .",
    "except for employing the same algorithm to obtain the eigenspectra from the cross - correlation matrix , previous studies were different in many aspects .",
    "table [ tab - pcarevsamp ] lists the main differences among previous studies , including sample selection and wavelength coverage .",
    "these are the main reasons that they obtained different eigenspectra and interpretations .",
    "additional differences arise from different implementation of a number of technical details in the analysis , such as whether the mean spectrum is subtracted or not , how the spectra are normalized , and how to deal with noise and gaps in the data .",
    "the present work incorporates two major improvements .",
    "( 1 ) we isolate a sample of quasars with a narrow range of fe ii  velocity shifts to minimize nonlinear effects in spca .",
    "( 2 ) we introduce a new quantity , called the fractional - contribution spectrum ; this parameter will turn out to be useful in understanding the physical meaning of the eigenspectra .",
    "our technique adopts a slightly different method of normalizing the spectra compared to previous studies .",
    "we apply spca to the 816 quasar spectra selected above .",
    "the process of constructing the cross - correlation matrix mainly follows @xcite . in detail , the steps are as follows .",
    "each spectrum is corrected for galactic extinction using the _ u_-band extinction listed in @xcite and the extinction law of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we then shift the spectrum to its rest frame using the redshift given in @xcite , which is based on [ o iii ]  @xmath105007 .",
    "although [ o iii ]  can be blueshifted , we adopt it to define the zero point of the velocity because the measurements of fe iivelocity shift were calculated with respect to [ o iii ]  in @xcite ( see their  3.5 for details ) .",
    "after deredshifting , all the spectra are rebinned to fixed wavelength bins , which are equally divided in logarithmic space with a dispersion of @xmath17 , covering the range 35005500  .",
    "the dispersion is selected to be equal to that of sdss spectra , and the wavelength range is covered by all the spectra in our sample .",
    "there are 1962 wavelength bins for each rebinned spectrum .",
    "the rebinned spectrum is normalized to unity average flux density over the wavelength interval 50755125  .",
    "normalization by the scalar product of the spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or by the integrated flux ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were adopted in previous work .",
    "we tested these three alternative methods of normalization and found that the derived eigenspectra are similar ( see also the test in  3.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "however , we found that the normalization method adopted here ( to have the unity flux density at 5100  ) produces more meaningful fractional - contribution spectrum ( see appendix [ app - pov ] for the definition ) , which helps us to interpret the physical meaning of the eigenspectra . following ( * ? ? ? * see their  3.2 ) , we do not scale the flux values for the sample in each wavelength bin to unity variance .    \\3 .",
    "we calculate the mean spectrum of the normalized spectra using all the good pixels and then subtract it from each of the original spectra .",
    "some previous studies do not subtract the mean spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in that case , the first eigenspectrum is equal to the mean spectrum , and their @xmath18th ( @xmath19 ) eigenspectrum should be compared with the ( @xmath20)th eigenspectrum in the present paper ( see also table [ tab - pcarevinter ] ) .",
    "the above steps result in a mean - subtracted flux matrix @xmath21 , whose element @xmath22 is the flux of the @xmath23th mean - subtracted spectrum in the @xmath24th wavelength bin .",
    "the goal of spca is to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the cross - correlation matrix @xmath25 , where @xmath26 denotes the transpose of matrix @xmath21 .",
    "this is achieved using singular value decomposition .",
    "the iteration method of @xcite is adopted to deal with the noise and bad pixels in the spectra .",
    "then , the mean - subtracted spectra are reconstructed as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 has columns @xmath29 as the eigenspectra , @xmath30 is an matrix whose element @xmath31 is the weight of the @xmath32th eigenspectrum for the @xmath23th mean - subtracted spectrum .",
    "the algorithm is described in detail in appendix [ app - derivation ] .",
    "the eigenspectra are arranged in the order of decreasing eigenvalues @xmath33 , which are also used to calculate the contribution of each eigenspectrum to the total variation of the input spectra as @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "thus , the first @xmath18th eigenspectra can account for @xmath35 percentage of the total variation .",
    "this quantity is used to determine how many eigenspectra are sufficient for understanding the input spectra , by comparing it to the intrinsic variation in percentage @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the quantities above are widely used in previous spca studies , but only have meaning as an average over the entire wavelength range . in this work ,",
    "we develop them into more sophisticated forms that apply to each wavelength bin , which are helpful in interpreting the eigenspectra in a physical way .",
    "we calculate the intrinsic variation and residual variation in each wavelength bin as @xcite did , but do not integrate them over wavelength . in an arbitrary @xmath24th wavelength bin ,",
    "we define @xmath37 as the proportion of the intrinsic variation , and @xmath38 represents the proportion of the variation accounted for by the @xmath32th eigenspectrum in this particular wavelength bin .",
    "thus , we obtain a matrix @xmath39 , which has the same shape as @xmath28 .",
    "each column ( @xmath40 ) of @xmath39 represents the contribution of the corresponding eigenspectrum and has the form of a spectrum .",
    "we call it _ the fractional - contribution spectrum_. using the fractional - contribution spectrum , it is straightforward to understand which spectral feature is dominated by which eigenspectrum .",
    "the details of our definitions and the comparison to previously used quantities are presented in appendix [ app - pov ] .",
    "in this section , we will first describe and interpret the derived eigenspectra phenomenologically , and then we will investigate correlations between the weights of the eigenspectra and the actual measurements derived from the original spectra , to confirm the interpretation .",
    "bootstrap is performed to study the stability and uncertainty of the eigenspectra .",
    "lastly , we will fit eigenspectrum 3 to demonstrate that it consists of a single , intermediate - width emission - line component .",
    "the horizontal dashed line marks the intrinsic variation in percentage , and the cross marks where the cumulative proportion of variation exceeds the intrinsic variation.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    figure [ fig - cumpov ] shows the cumulative proportion of variation accounted for by eigenspectra added successively .",
    "the intrinsic variation , in percentage , is @xmath41 ( horizontal dashed line ) ; it can be accounted for by the first 28 eigenspectra ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "this confirms that it is sufficient to considering only the first 30 eigenspectra ( appendix [ app - derivation ] ) .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ fig - esall](a ) shows the mean spectrum of the normalized spectra .",
    "as it resembles the composite quasar spectrum of @xcite , it implies that the sample for spca used here is not strongly biased .",
    "the lower panel shows , @xmath43 , the proportion of the intrinsic variation in each wavelength bin .",
    "it drops to 0 around 5100   because we normalized the spectrum to unity over 50755125  .",
    "@xmath43 rises toward shorter wavelengths because of the blue power - law continuum of quasars .",
    "as expected , @xmath43 also shows that the most variable emission features are the balmer lines , [ o iii ] , and fe ii .",
    "figures [ fig - esall](b)(f ) show the first five eigenspectra ( upper panels ) and the corresponding fractional - contribution spectra ( lower panels ) .",
    "the number in the upper panel indicates the proportion of the variation accounted for by each eigenspectrum , as defined in equation ( [ eqn - pk ] ) .",
    "apart from the first five shown here , higher order eigenspectra each contribute only a tiny proportion of the variation ( @xmath44 for @xmath45 ) .",
    "the first three eigenspectra are the most prominent , not only because they contribute , respectively , 61.5% , 12.0% , and 4.9% of the variation in total , but also because they account for more than @xmath1250% of the variation in many wavelength bins .",
    "moreover , the three eigenspectra resemble realistic components in quasar spectra .",
    "we will describe them phenomenologically below .",
    "eigenspectrum 1 clearly consists of two components : a power - law continuum and balmer emission lines .",
    "the balmer continuum is also present , because the blue end of the eigenspectrum is steeper than a simple power law extrapolated from the red end .",
    "the balmer emission lines in this eigenspectrum are broader than those in the mean spectrum .",
    "the fractional contribution decreases from @xmath12100% at the blue end to @xmath120% at the red end ; considering our adopted normalization , this indicates that this eigenspectrum represents the change of the slope of the power - law continuum . in detail",
    ", the fractional - contribution spectrum dips near the center of the balmer lines , indicating eigenspectrum 1 contributes only to the line wings .",
    "eigenspectrum 2 and its fractional - contribution spectrum clearly reveals a series of narrow emission - line features , including  @xmath103727 , [ ne iii ]  @xmath103869 , [ o iii ]  @xmath104363 , he ii  @xmath104686 , [ o iii]@xmath464959 , 5007 , and balmer lines .",
    "note that narrow he ii  is weak in the eigenspectrum but prominent in the fractional - contribution spectrum .",
    "this suggests that weak he ii  also varies and correlates with other narrow emission lines .",
    "eigenspectrum 2 accounts for almost 100% at the center of [ o iii ]  @xmath464959 , 5007 , meaning that it causes almost all the variation in narrow emission lines .",
    "eigenspectrum 3 accounts for only 4.9% of the total variation but contributes significantly in several narrow wavelength bands .",
    "figure [ fig - esall](d ) exhibits clean fe ii  emission , as well as balmer lines that are narrower than those in eigenspectrum 1 but broader than those in eigenspectrum 2 .",
    "the fractional - contribution spectrum in the lower panel indicates that this eigenspectrum mainly contributes fe ii  emission and the core of the balmer lines .",
    "note that although the eigenspectrum shows negative narrow features at the wavelengths of , [ ne iii ] , and [ o iii ] , it accounts for almost no variation in these wavelength bins .",
    "these negative features are neither absorption lines nor inverse correlations between the narrow emission lines and fe ii ; they arise only from cross talk @xcite . otherwise , as demonstrated by the simulations in  [ sec - simct ]",
    ", the fractional contribution will be large at the wavelengths of these lines .",
    "eigenspectra 4 and 5 do not resemble realistic spectra , but show `` w''-shaped features that represent variations in emission - line widths @xcite .",
    "they contributes variation in the same wavelength bands where they show the `` w '' shapes .",
    "eigenspectrum 4 mainly contributes to the variation of h@xmath0wings and fe ii , indicating the correlation between h@xmath0  width and fe iistrength .",
    "eigenspectrum 5 contributes @xmath1240% variation at the blue wings of [ o iii ]  @xmath464959 , 5007 , suggesting that it represents the blueshifted wings of the [ o iii ]  lines .",
    "it also accounts for a fraction of the fe ii  variation , indicating a correlation between fe ii  emission and the [ o iii ]  blue wing .",

    "figure [ fig - simre ] shows the derived spca results .",
    "the first three eigenspectra , added up , account for 82.40% of the total variation , and are sufficient for describing the intrinsic variation ( 82.26% of the total ) .",
    "this is consistent with the number of free parameters included in the simulation . comparing the results here with those in figure [ fig - esall",

    "it provides additional evidence that the measurement of fe ii  velocity shift in @xcite is reliable in these two samples .",
    "note that the negative features of [ o iii ]  arise from cross talk , not redshift .",

    "the eigenspectra and fractional - contribution spectra of these three samples are very similar .",
    "their first two eigenspectra and fractional - contribution spectra resemble those of the primary sample ( judging from the fractional - contribution spectra , note that the [ o iii ]  lines in eigenspectra 1 arise just from cross talk ) , while fractional - contribution spectra 3 are different .",
    "eigenspectra 3 of these three samples contribute little in terms of fe ii  emission .",
    "their contributions over the entire wavelength range are also minimal .",
    "thus , eigenspectra 3 of samples c , d , and e do not record the intermediate - width component .",
    "this is reasonable because ew(fe ii ) in the three samples is small and h@xmath0  is rather broad @xcite and tends to have single - gaussian profiles ( figure 1(a ) of @xcite ) .",
    "the intermediate - width component is expected to be weak , contributes little to the total variation , and can be easily smeared by nonlinear factors .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the fact that the first two eigenspectra have already contributed a larger proportion of variation ( @xmath86 80% ) than the first three eigenspectra of the primary sample ( 78.4% ) .    in conclusion",

    "given this situation , it is important to ask whether the principal result of this paper , namely that the balmer lines contain two physically distinct components , is unique to our sample or applies to the quasar population in general .",
    "the key test of this scenario is to perform a detailed decomposition of the broad h@xmath0profile , to isolate the two kinematic components .",

    "a bluer continuum has more ionizing photons relative to the non - ionizing continuum at 5100  , to which the ews in the present paper all refer .",
    "thus , an inverse correlation between the ew of an emission line and @xmath53 arises naturally if the line - emitting clouds are optically thick to , and photoionized by , the same continuum that we see , and the clouds emits isotropically . on the other hand ,",
    "the lack of any correlation between the intermediate - width component and the continuum slope reflects the complexity of the dynamics @xcite and physics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* and reference therein ) of the fe ii - producing gas .",
    "these two different dependences on spectral slope , in conjunction with the distinct locations and dynamics implied by their different velocity widths and shifts , indicate that the two components may respond very differently to continuum variations .",

    "the width of the broad h@xmath0  emission line has been widely used to estimate virial velocities to derive bh masses in agns .",
    "our two - component model for the h@xmath0-emitting region raises an important question : which component better traces the virialized portion of the blr ?",
    "our spca results suggest that the very broad component is more appropriate for bh mass estimation .",

    "we select a sample of 816 quasars with small fe ii  velocity shift from sdss and perform spectral principal component analysis ( spca ) on this sample in rest wavelength range 35005500  .",
    "apart from adjusting some details in the spca algorithm , we introduce , for the first time , a parameter called _ the fractional - contribution spectrum _ that measures _ the proportion of the variation accounted for by an eigenspectrum in a wavelength bin_. we demonstrate the utility of this new parameter in helping to interpret the eigenspectra .",
    "we explore the correlations between the weights of the eigenspectra and various physical quantities to confirm the physical meaning of the eigenspectra .",
    "we perform a bootstrap analysis , spectral fitting of the eigenspectra , and monte carlo simulations to test the uncertainty of the eigenspectra , the validity of the fractional - contribution spectrum we introduced , and the two - component model of the h@xmath0-emitting region we propose .",
    "our principal findings from spca are as follows .",
    "the first three eigenspectra have clear physical meanings .",
    "eigenspectrum 1 represents the power - law continuum , very broad balmer emission lines , and the correlation between them .",
    "eigenspectrum 2 represents narrow emission lines .",
    "eigenspectra 3 consists of fe ii  lines and balmer lines with kinematically similar intermediate velocities .",
    "the fractional - contribution spectrum is a powerful tool for diagnosing the emission features represented in each eigenspectrum , as well as for recognizing spurious features that arise from cross talk .",
    "the broad h@xmath0  line consists of two physically distinct components : a very broad component whose strength correlates with the slope of the optical power - law continuum , and an intermediate - width component that has the profile of , and correlates with , fe ii .    while our current sample is biased toward objects with strong fe ii  emission , we argue that our overall findings are immune from strong sample selection bias and are generally applicable to the general quasar population .",
    "this means that the strength of the intermediate - width h@xmath0  component varies from source to source and could vanish . in extreme cases",
    "h@xmath0  only has a single gaussian component .",
    "we will rigorously test this conclusion in a forthcoming work , where we will perform detailed spectral decomposition using the new template spectrum for fe ii  emission and intermediate - velocity balmer lines derived from eigenspectrum 3 .",
    "the two - component nature of the broad h@xmath0  line raises important concerns about the robustness of current virial bh mass estimates that make use of the h@xmath0  line width .",

    ", we adopt similar fitting methods , take he ii  into consideration , measure @xmath93  for the five composite spectra generated in @xcite , and test the statistical significance of our measurement of @xmath93 .",
    "we confirm that our redshift measurements of fe ii  are robust .",
    "the details of the five composite spectra are described in  4.6 of @xcite .",
    "briefly , the composite spectra are geometric means @xcite of the spectra of quasars in five bins of different @xmath93measured in @xcite : @xmath16250 to 250 @xmath3  ( a , 1350 objects ) , 250 to 750 @xmath3  ( b , 1362 objects ) , 750 to 1250 @xmath3  ( c , 590 objects ) , 1250 to 1750 @xmath3",
    "( d , 332 objects ) , and 1750 to 2250 @xmath3  ( e , 180 objects ) .",
    "our fitting method here resembles that in @xcite but is improved in two aspects : ( 1 ) the he ii  line is included and ( 2 ) the power - law continuum , fe iiemission , and other lines are fitted simultaneously .",
    "the left column of figure [ fig - feschi ] shows our results . for each velocity shift bin ,",
    "the top panel shows the continuum - subtracted composite spectrum ( black ) and best - fit model ( red ) .",
    "besides the power - law continuum , the model contains the following components : ( 1 ) fe ii  emission ( blue ) modeled by broadening , scaling , and shifting the i zw 1 fe template constructed by @xcite , ( 2 ) broad emission lines ( green ) modeled by a set of gaussian - hermite functions representing h@xmath0  @xmath104861 , h@xmath94  @xmath104340 , h@xmath95  @xmath104102 , and he ii  @xmath104686 , ( 3 ) narrow emission lines ( cyan ) modeled by a set of single gaussians representing h@xmath0 , h@xmath94 , h@xmath95 , [ o iii ]  @xmath464959 , 5007 , [ o iii ]  @xmath104363 , and he ii  @xmath104686 , and ( 4 ) wings of the [ o iii ]  lines ( magenta ) modeled by a set of single gaussians .",
    "the lines in each set have the same shape and shift , but different intensities .",
    "the bottom panel shows the residuals .",
    "the fitting is performed in the wavelength window 40005600  .",

    "we use the @xmath14-test described in  11.4 of @xcite . in the fitting described above , if @xmath93  is free to vary the best fit has chi - square @xmath96 with 1435 degrees of freedom , and the reduced chi - square @xmath97 . if we fix @xmath93  to a constant but",
    "allow all other parameters to vary and fit the composite spectra again , the new best fit has chi - square @xmath98 with 1435@xmath521 degrees of freedom . from equation 11.50 of @xcite , the quantity @xmath99 follows a @xmath100 distribution , where @xmath101 in this case .",

    "is much larger than the value derived here .",
    "this led those authors to conclude that the best - fit value of 730 @xmath3  for the velocity shift of their b1 subsample is not distinguishable from zero shift .",
    "it is not clear to us how they derive this large value for the @xmath6  ratio . ]",
    "we fix @xmath93  from @xmath16200 to 2000 @xmath3 , obtain the best - fit chi - square @xmath98 for each fixed input value of @xmath93 , and build up a @xmath6curve for each composite spectrum , as shown in the right column of figure [ fig - feschi ] ( crosses ) . for convenience ,",
    "the chi - squares are plotted as @xmath110 .",
    "the equivalent values of @xmath111 are also labeled on the right of the plot , for comparison with figure 1 of @xcite .",
    "the solid square marks the best - fit result when @xmath93  is free to vary .",
    "the insert zooms in around the minimum of the @xmath6  curve .",
    "the 3@xmath106 confidence interval of the @xmath93  measurement can be determined by the two points when @xmath110 reaches 9.03 ( marked by the horizontal dashed line ) .",
    "fixing @xmath93  to values outside of this velocity interval gives worse @xmath6  than setting @xmath93  free , at 3@xmath106 confidence level .",
    "the best - fit value of @xmath93  when it is free to vary and its lower and upper 3@xmath106 bounds are labeled in the panel on the left column .",
    "for all five composite spectra the @xmath98 when @xmath93  is fixed to zero are significantly larger than @xmath96 when @xmath93  is allowed to vary .",
    "thus , the fe ii  emission in the composite spectra _ do _ exhibit significant velocity shift .",
    "the resultant values of @xmath93  ( and its 3@xmath106 confidence level ) for the five composite spectra are @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 @xmath3 .",
    "the measured @xmath93  of the first three composite spectra are consistent with the velocity shift range of the bins , while those of the last two are slightly lower .",
    "this discrepancy is probably caused by the enhancement of the un - shifted spectral features ( e.g. , narrow emission lines and host galaxy component ) during the stacking .",
    "figure 12 of @xcite shows that ca ii  absorption lines , produced by host galaxy starlight , are prominent in composites d and e. this shortcoming of the composite spectra has already been discussed in  4.6 of @xcite ; it also explains why the velocity shifts of fe ii  can not be seen by direct visual inspection .",
    "he ii  emission and host galaxy contamination may affect the @xmath93  measurement in some individual cases .",
    "a thorough analysis of this problem , taking both factors into consideration , is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , the fact that @xmath93  is seen both in the composite spectra and it has a value similar to the velocity shift range used to stack the composite spectra suggest that the measurement of @xmath93  in @xcite is reliable for the majority of quasars .",
    "the values of @xmath93  are thus suitable for the spca study in this paper .",
    "in fact , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their  3.3 ) had already tested the reliability of their @xmath93  measurements for the s / n of sdss spectra . moreover ,",
    "the influence of he ii  emission is mitigated by the fact that fe ii  is fitted over a rather wide wavelength range .",
    "we do not have a definitive explanation for the contradictory results obtained by @xcite .",
    "part of the problem may lie in the manner in which they constructed their composite spectra , which are defined by parameters of their 4d eigenvector 1 formalism , namely h@xmath0  width and fe ii / h@xmath0  intensity ratio .",
    "figure 9 of @xcite shows that these parameters are poorly correlated with @xmath93 .",
    "thus , composite spectra generated in bins of these spectral properties are not equivalent to those constructed from bins in @xmath93 .",
    "we suspect that this may be the reason that @xcite failed to see the fe ii  velocity shifts reported by @xcite .",
    "this appendix describe the detailed algorithm for deriving the eigenspectra .",
    "the algorithm basically follows that in @xcite .    after the three steps of spectra preprocessing described in  [ sec - pcamath ] , we prepare three @xmath117 matrices : @xmath21 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 , where @xmath21 has element @xmath22 as the flux of the @xmath23th mean - subtracted spectrum in the @xmath24th wavelength bin , and @xmath118 and @xmath119 specify the corresponding flux errors and masks given by the sdss spectra .",
    "the goal of spca is to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the correlation matrix @xmath25 : @xmath120 where @xmath26 denotes the transpose of matrix @xmath21 , @xmath28 is an @xmath121 orthogonal matrix whose columns ( @xmath29 , @xmath122 ) are the eigenvectors of @xmath123 , @xmath124 is an @xmath121 diagonal matrix diag(@xmath125 ) , and @xmath33 are the eigenvalues of @xmath25 .",
    "this can be achieved using singular value decomposition ( svd ) : @xmath126 where @xmath127 is an @xmath128 column orthogonal matrix . defining @xmath129 ,",
    "the mean - subtracted spectra can be reconstructed using the eigenspectra @xmath130 where @xmath30 is an @xmath128 matrix , @xmath31 is the weight of the @xmath32th eigenspectrum for the @xmath23th mean - subtracted spectrum .",
    "next , we derive the eigenspectra iteratively , taking the errors @xmath118 and masks @xmath119 into account",
    "the bad pixels in the mean - subtracted spectra are initially corrected by mean interpolation , following @xcite .",
    "the flux of a bad pixel in any given spectrum is replaced by the mean of the fluxes of all the other spectra in the same wavelength bin , which is zero : @xmath131 for @xmath132 that @xmath133 represents bad .",
    "the second equation holds because @xmath21 is mean - subtracted .",
    "actually , the choice of interpolation method for the initial bad pixel correction does not affect the resultant final eigenspectra .",
    "but the mean interpolation adopted here makes the convergence of eigenspectra faster @xcite and is quite simple ( by just setting the flux to zero here ) .",
    "the corrected flux matrix @xmath134 is then factorized in the form of equation ( [ eqn - svd ] ) using the algorithm for svd in chapter 2.6 of @xcite .",
    "each column ( @xmath29 ) of the derived matrix @xmath28 is an eigenspectrum ; they are arranged in the order of decreasing eigenvalues @xmath33 .",
    "the mean - subtracted spectra are reconstructed using the eigenspectra obtained , taking the errors and masks into account . for the @xmath23th spectrum",
    ", we find the set of @xmath135 ( the coefficient of the @xmath32th eigenspectra for the @xmath23th spectrum ) by minimizing the quantity @xmath136 this can be solved by gauss - jordan elimination ( see  2 of @xcite for details of the derivation ) . the reconstructed spectrum @xmath137 . in practice ,",
    "only the first several tens eigenspectra are needed for reconstructing quasar spectra @xcite .",
    "we find that the first 30 are sufficient for the case here ( figure [ fig - cumpov ] in  [ sec - pcades ] ) .",
    "the bad pixels in @xmath21 are corrected again , using the reconstructed spectra obtained in the last step : @xmath138 .",
    "then we cycle back to step 2 with the new @xmath134 .",
    "the loop in steps 24 iterates until the eigenspectra converge . following @xcite , the commonality between the eigenspectra derived in the @xmath18th iteration ( @xmath139 ) and that in the @xmath140th iteration ( @xmath141 ) is defined as @xmath142 where tr is the trace of a matrix",
    ", @xmath143 is the dimension of the two sets of eigenspectra for comparison , and @xmath144 is the sum of the projection operators @xmath139 , @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the @xmath32th eigenspectrum derived in the @xmath18th iteration .",
    "this quantity is unity if the two sets of eigenspectra are identical , and is zero if they are disjoint .",
    "it is not necessary to compare the entire set .",
    "we compare the first 30 eigenspectra for consistency with the reconstruction of the spectrum in step 3 .",
    "after five iterations , @xmath147 ( see figure 1 of @xcite for comparison ) .",
    "thus , in this work , all eigenspectra are obtained with five iterations .",
    "this paper introduces a new quantity , the fractional - contribution spectrum , which is useful for understanding eigenspectra . here",
    "we present its definition in detail and compare it to other quantities widely used in the literature .",
    "the total variation of the sample is defined as the sum of the squares of the differences between the normalized spectra and the mean spectrum : @xmath148 it consists of two parts : one that accounts for the noise in the original spectra , @xmath149 and another that describes intrinsic variation , @xmath150 .",
    "it is more straightforward to express them in percentages , such that @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "the proportion of the variation accounted for by the @xmath32th eigenspectrum can be calculated as @xmath153 where @xmath33 is the eigenvalue for the @xmath32th eigenspectrum @xcite .",
    "this is the quantity used in previous spca studies , and it represents the contribution of an eigenspectrum to the total variation of the input spectra over the entire wavelength range .",
    "thus , the first @xmath18th eigenspectra can account for @xmath35 percentage of the total variation ; it is called the cumulative proportion of variation and increases monotonically with @xmath18 .",
    "when it reaches @xmath36 , it indicates that the first @xmath18 eigenspectra are sufficient for explaining the intrinsic variation in the sample , and the remaining higher order eigenspectra contribute only to noise and can be ignored for our purposes ( see also  [ sec - pcades ] ) .",
    "the quantities defined above were widely used in previous spca studies , but they only refer to the average properties of the eigenspectra over the entire wavelength range . in this work , we develop these quantities to investigate the eigenspectra in each wavelength bin , as follows .    first , the total and noise variation in the @xmath24th wavelength bin can be simply defined as @xmath154 and @xmath155 second , after using the first @xmath18th eigenspectra for reconstruction , the residual variation in the @xmath24th wavelength bin is the sum of the square of the differences between the reconstructed spectra and mean - subtracted spectra in the specific wavelength bin : @xmath156 the proportion of the variation accounted for by the @xmath18th eigenspectrum in the @xmath24th wavelength bin is @xmath157 as in the case applied to the entire wavelength range , these values are compared with @xmath158 to determine the significance of each eigenspectrum .    , weighted by @xmath159 , versus @xmath160 , expressed in percentage .",
    "@xmath32 increases from 1 to 30 from bottom left to top right",

    "<S> we report on a spectral principal component analysis ( spca ) of a sample of 816 quasars , selected to have small fe ii  velocity shifts with spectral coverage in the rest wavelength range 35005500  . the sample is explicitly designed to mitigate spurious effects on spca induced by fe ii velocity shifts . </S>",
    "<S> we improve the algorithm of spca in the literature and introduce a new quantity , _ the fractional - contribution spectrum _ , that effectively identifies the emission features encoded in each eigenspectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the first eigenspectrum clearly records the power - law continuum and very broad balmer emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> narrow emission lines dominate the second eigenspectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the third eigenspectrum represents the fe ii  emission and a component of the balmer lines with kinematically similar intermediate velocity widths . </S>",
    "<S> correlations between the weights of the eigenspectra and parametric measurements of line strength and continuum slope confirm the above interpretation for the eigenspectra . </S>",
    "<S> monte carlo simulations demonstrate the validity of our method to recognize cross talk in spca and firmly rule out a single - component model for broad h@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we also present the results of spca for four other samples that contain quasars in bins of larger fe ii  velocity shift ; similar eigenspectra are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the h@xmath0-emitting region has two kinematically distinct components : one with very large velocities whose strength correlates with the continuum shape , and another with more modest , intermediate velocities that is closely coupled to the gas that gives rise to fe ii  emission . </S>"
