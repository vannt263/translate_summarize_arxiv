    "the 3@xmath3 paradigm is presently challenged by anomalies found in short - baseline ( sbl ) neutrino oscillation experiments : the reactor antineutrino anomaly @xcite , which is a deficit of the rate of @xmath16 events measured in reactor neutrino experiments ; the gallium neutrino anomaly @xcite , consisting in a deficit of the rate of @xmath4 events measured in the gallium radioactive source experiments gallex @xcite and sage @xcite ; the lsnd anomaly , which is an excess of the rate of @xmath16 events in a beam composed mainly of @xmath17 s produced by @xmath18 decay at rest @xcite .",
    "these anomalies can not be explained by neutrino oscillations in the 3@xmath3 scenario .",
    "a possible explanation , still in the framework of neutrino oscillations , requires the existence of a new short - baseline squared - mass difference @xmath19 , which is much larger than the solar and atmospheric squared - mass differences .",
