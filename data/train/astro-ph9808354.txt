    "gravitational lenses in nature usually consist of a primary lensing galaxy and , in many cases , perturbation field caused by , for example , nearby galaxies and clusters of galaxies along the sight - line ( see keeton , kochanek , & seljak 1997 ) . thus , modeling an observed lens requires the construction of a realistic mass model , including accounting for any perturbation that may be present .",
    "this paper developes a ( semi-)analytical method to calculate lensing due to the primary mass distribution .    lensing objects ( e.g.  galaxies or galaxy clusters ) show , in general , 3-dimensional mass distributions which are non - spherically symmetric .",
    "elliptical galaxies are known to be triaxial in shape , as well as oblate and prolate ( see , e.g. , ryden 1992 ) .",
    "spiral galaxies can be considered flattened spheroids .",
    "clusters of galaxies are also known to be non - spherical in shape .",
    "gravitational lensing by these concentrations of mass in the universe is difficult to deal with mathematically . for a projected surface density of elliptical shape schramm ( 1990 )",
    "introduced a relatively simple formulation equivalent to the early formulation by bourassa , kantowski , & norton ( 1973 ) and bourassa & kantowski ( 1975 , see also bray 1984 ) . in the above formulations",
    "the deflections are given as integrals .",
    "thus , one can deal with lensing by elliptical mass distributions through numerical integrations .",
    "while numerical integration is a way of dealing with lensing by elliptical mass distributions , it has not been preferred by most researchers .    to `` simulate '' real lenses in nature while avoiding mathematical complexities or costly numerical integrations ,",
    "several lens models have been considered in the literature .",
    "first , circularly symmetric lenses perturbed by an external shear term ( also called a quadrupole term ) were used ( e.g.  chang & refsdal 1979 , 1984 ; kovner 1987a ; kochanek 1991 ; wambsganss & paczyski 1994 ) .",
    "in addition , kochanek ( 1991 ) considered other types of perturbations ( internal & mixed ) .",
    "this approach has the great advantage of mathematical simplicity .",
    "it could be a good approximation of a real lens in some situations .",
    "however , this approach is somewhat artificial and does not take into account the real distributions of mass .",
    "secondly , lenses with elliptical deflection potentials were studied ( e.g.  kovner 1987b , c ; blandford & kochanek 1987a ; kochanek & blandford 1987 ; kochanek et al .",
    "elliptical potentials are easier to handle than elliptical mass distributions . for a small ellipticity elliptical potentials",
    "correspond to physical ( elliptical ) mass distributions via the poisson equation , but for a larger ellipticity ( e.g.  @xmath1 ) the corresponding mass distributions obtain unphysical dumbbell shapes ( see kassiola & kovner 1993 ) .",
    "thirdly , a multipole expansion of elliptical mass distributions was considered by schneider & weiss ( 1991 ) who expanded a 2-dimensional distribution of mass with elliptical symmetry and calculated the corresponding potential coefficients .",
    "thus , in this approach a ( nearly ) elliptical mass distribution is described by the several lowest - order terms in the expansion .",
    "lastly , for a few special cases the deflection angles were obtained in simple ( closed ) forms . for elliptical `` isothermal '' lenses ( where the surface mass density @xmath2 [ @xmath3 at large @xmath4 ) , the deflection angles were calculated by kassiola & kovner ( 1993 ) and kormann , schneider , & bartelmann ( 1994 ) .",
    "kassiola & kovner ( 1993 ) also calculated the deflection angles for other integer values of @xmath5 , i.e.  @xmath5 = 3 , 4 , 5 , etc . for singular power - law mass distributions ,",
    "the deflection angle was obtained by grogin & narayan ( 1996 ) .",
    "all of the above lens models avoid numerical integrations and are relatively easy to use .",
    "however , we know that most ( if not all ) of them are limited in their applications . for the generalized non - circular power - law mass distributions where the parameter @xmath5 and core radius are arbitrary , numerical integrations ( bourassa & kantowski 1975 ; schramm 1990 ) and multipole expansions ( schneider & weiss 1991 ) have been considered and the former approach has sometimes been used to calculate lensing properties ( e.g. most recently by keeton and kochanek 1997 ) . in",
    "the schneider & weiss ( 1991 ) approach an elliptical mass distribution is expanded and several lowest - order terms are used to describe the original mass distribution",
    ". this approximation can be effective for a less elliptical mass distribution because only a few terms suffice to describe the original mass distribution .",
    "however , for a highly elliptical mass distribution this approach becomes increasingly less effective because many terms are necessary to approximate the original mass distribution .",
    "also , we do not , at present , find any examples in the literature where this approach was used . for the above reasons this approach will not be further discussed . in this paper we present an analytical approach to lensing by the generalized power - law mass distributions . in our approach",
    "all of the terms in the infinite series can be integrated in closed forms ( as hypergeometric functions ) , and the series themselves have well - defined convergence properties . as a result , we obtain the deflection and magnification in ready - to - use forms .",
    "our approach is a straightforward and user - friendly way to calculate lensing properties more effectively than the more conventional methods mentioned above .",
    "our results can be used by those who want to use ( exactly ) elliptical surface mass densities ( or , 3-dimensional triaxial mass distributions directly ) and who do not want to use numerical integrations .",
    "we applied our results to the einstein cross and they were very effective ( chae , turnshek , & khersonsky 1998 ) .",
    "our approach is as follows .",
    "we represent the deflection potential as a fourier series for an arbitrary projected surface density . from the deflection potential",
    "we obtain the deflection angle as a series .",
    "we calculate the projected surface mass density of the triaxial power - law mass distribution and thus relate the parameters of the surface mass density to those of the 3-dimensional mass density .",
    "we calculate the coefficients in the series of the deflection angle for the surface density .",
    "we obtain expressions for the deflection angle and magnification factor .",
    "the above procedures are described in  2 ; the details of mathematics can be found in the appendices . in ",
    "3 we describe how the behaviors of critical curves and caustics depend on the parameters of the elliptical power - law mass distributions .",
    "concluding remarks are given in  4 .",
    "in this subsection we briefly summarize the basic equations of gravitational lensing and define the coefficients of the series of the deflection potential .",
    "our treatment of lensing is based on the scalar potential formalism given by schneider ( 1985 ) and blandford & narayan ( 1986 ) .",
    "our notation is similar to that used by schneider , ehlers , & falco ( 1992 , hereafter sef ) and blandford & kochanek ( 1987b ) .    when a light ray emitted by a quasar ( i.e.  the source ) at angular diameter distance @xmath6 passes through a transparent distribution of mass ( i.e.  the deflector ) at @xmath7 , the light ray experiences a deflection and the condition for the deflected light ray to reach the observer is given by the lens equation ( sef ) @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the position vector of the quasar on the source plane and @xmath10 is the impact vector of the light ray on the lens plane , both with respect to the optical axis ( defined below ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 is the deflection angle and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the angular diameter distances to the deflector , the source , and from the deflector to the source , respectively .",
    "the optical axis is defined as the infinite line joining the observer and the center of mass of the lens . by introducing an arbitrary length scale @xmath14 and defining @xmath15 ( deflector vector ) , @xmath16 ( source vector ) ,",
    "the above equation becomes the dimensionless lens equation @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the scaled deflection angle which is related to the deflection potential @xmath19 by @xmath20 .",

    "the positive constants ( @xmath41 ) represent the core sizes along each axis . in passing ,",

    "a physical distribution of mass must satisfy @xmath54 because @xmath55 corresponds to a constant surface density on the lens plane ( see eq .  [ 15 ] ) .    since a lensing galaxy ( or any lensing object ) can be oriented in an arbitrary direction relative to the lens plane , three parameters are needed to relate the body coordinates @xmath56 to the lens coordinates ( @xmath57 ) , where @xmath58 is the direction toward the observer .",

    "are inside the second caustic while the other two are `` naked '' outside and the second caustic is of an elliptical shape . at this stage",
    "the second caustic is called `` radial '' while the first caustic is called `` tangential '' ( see , e.g. , sef )",

    "in the case of no caustic , multiple imaging is impossible . when there is one liplike caustic , three images become possible .",

    "the effect of varying radial index @xmath5 on the critical behavior can be qualitatively understood by comparing figures 1 , 2 , and 3 .",
    "for example , for @xmath150 and @xmath151 , the case @xmath156 has one liplike caustic .",
    "for the same ellipticity and core radius , the isothermal case has two caustics . for @xmath157 , two cusps of the tangential caustic",
    "are inside the radial caustic ( i.e.  the second caustic is grown relative to the first caustic ) . now",
    "the significance of @xmath5 on the critical structure is evident . for",
    "given ellipticity and core radius , a sufficiently shallow profile does not allow any caustic .",
    "as the profile steepens , the first caustic will appear , then the second caustic , and finally the radial caustic will enclose the tangential caustic completely .",
    "we obtained the complete expressions for the deflection angle and magnification factor as ( rapidly ) converging series for the triaxial mass distribution of equation ( 14 ) and for the elliptical surface density of equation ( 19 ) .",
    "the calculation of an angle ( eq .  [ 34 ] ) at a point on the image plane requires evaluations of three functions which are given by equations ( 26 ) , ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) . for the calculation of the magnification ( eq .  [ 45 ] ) one needs to evaluate two additional functions ( equations [ 43 ] and [ 44 ] ) .",
    "since they converge very rapidly all these functions can be easily evaluated .",
    "the hypergeometric function in equations ( 26 ) , ( 27 ) , ( 28 ) , ( 43 ) and ( 44 ) , which is a well - behaved converging series , can be evaluated rapidly .",
    "for instance , one can evaluate the hypergeometric function by summing up less than tens of terms .",
    "however , since the hypergeometric function should be evaluated a number of times ( namely , the function should be called many times ) for the calculation of the deflection and magnification , the execution speed in our approach depends on how the hypergeometric function is evaluated .",
    "if one evaluates the hypergeometric function solely by summing up terms , it typically takes about one milli - second for the calculation of the deflection and magnification at a time on a current ( sparc20 ) unix machine with a fractional uncertainty of about @xmath158 or better .",
    "for example , if the deflection angle is one arcsecond , then the calculational error is about one hundredth milli - arcsecond or smaller with the execution speed specified above .",
    "now that our results have been presented , one can ask how well the mass model ( eq .  [ 14 ] or eq .  [ 19 ] ) resembles the true mass distribution of a real lens .",
    "an application of our results to the einstein cross ( q2237 + 0305 ) , which is known to be lensed by an isolated barred spiral galaxy , shows that the model is a good approximation to the true mass distribution ( chae et al .",
    "1998 ) . in most of the other lensed systems",
    "external perturbations are known to be important ( keeton et al .",
    "1997 ) . thus , unless the external perturbations are taken into account properly in fitting observational constraints , it is not possible to judge whether or not the mass model is a good description of the true mass distribution . there have been numerous lens modeling examples where isothermal models were used .",
    "the mass distributions of lenses in nature may differ only slightly from isothermal distributions .",
    "however , lenses in the universe will not , in general , exactly mimic isothermal distributions .",
    "thus , it is worthwhile to consider arbitrary values of @xmath5 .",
    "the model we considered here encompasses the isothermal model as a special case ( i.e.  @xmath53 ) but allows us to vary the parameter @xmath5 from the isothermal value .    in conclusion , the following are what we consider to be the most notable aspects of our results .    1 .",
