    "power flow , the most fundamental concept in power system engineering , is at the heart of studies ranging from daily operation to long - term planning of electricity networks .",
    "ac power flow problem is a system of nonlinear algebraic equations that mathematically models the steady - state relations between the phasor representation of parameters and unknown states in an ac circuit .",
    "the parameters typically consist of power generated and consumed by source and sink nodes and the electrical properties , i.e. the impedance , of lines that connect these nodes .",
    "the unknown states are primarily voltage phasors but could also include continuous or discrete variables associated with network controllers , e.g. facts devices and tap - changing or phase - shifting transformers .",
    "the accurate and reliable determination of these states is imperative for control and thus for efficient and stable operation of the network . in certain studies",
    "it is equally vital to determine for which parameter values the power flow problem becomes infeasible as this condition is intimately linked to saddle - node bifurcation and the voltage collapse phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "the distance in the parameter space to power flow infeasibility can serve as a margin of voltage stability  @xcite .",
    "this is certainly one of the most theoretical areas in electrical engineering .",
    "as conventional power systems undergo a fundamental transformation by large - scale highly - variable wind and solar generation , distributed across the network , this field can experience a resurgence  @xcite .",
    "given the inherent limitations of traditional methods , deeper understanding of these complicated phenomena requires new theoretical approaches rooted in complex analysis and algebraic geometry .",
    "the basis of power flow is kirchhoff s current law which states that for every node @xmath0 in @xmath1 , the set of all nodes , @xmath2 , the net current flowing out of that node , is related to its voltage @xmath3 and those of its adjacent nodes @xmath4 in the following way :    @xmath5 } v_ky_{ik}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath6 and @xmath7 $ ] are the open and closed neighborhoods of node @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath8 is the current flow through the line connecting node @xmath0 and @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the impedance of that line which is used to construct the diagonal and off - diagonal elements of the admittance matrix as ,    @xmath11    since complex power is @xmath12 , the power flow problem in its complex form can be expressed as , @xmath13 } v^*_iv_k y_{ik } & \\forall i\\in   \\mathcal{n}-\\{r\\ } \\label{complex}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath14 is the voltage reference node with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "it also serves as the slack node meaning that @xmath17 is a free parameter that accounts for the mismatch of complex power and its losses throughout the network .",
    "the numerical methods , developed historically to solve this problem , take the polynomial system of ( [ complex ] ) out of its complex form by reformulating it either in rectangular form as in ( [ rect ] ) or in polar form as in ( [ polar ] ) where @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",

    "the first issue is the poor convergence of the tangent - based search methods , likely due to the increased curvature of the hypersurfaces in   or  .",
    "the second issue near the feasibility boundary where two or more algebraic branches coalesce at a branch point is convergence to solutions that lie on other algebraic branches . although dependent on the dynamical model of the physical system , these solutions in power systems typically signify unstable  @xcite or low voltage  @xcite operating points .",
    "most of these operating points can not be physically realized and are thus false solutions .",
    "the region of initial guesses in newton s method that converge to a particular solution has a fractal boundary .",
    "the multiple fractal domains of convergence are pressed together near the bifurcation manifold which explains erratic behavior of such methods in finding the desirable , i.e. stable / high voltage , solution even with seemingly reasonable initial guesses  @xcite .",
    "recently a semidefinite relaxation of rectangular power flow in   has been reformulated as a special case of optimal power flow where the objective function of the semidefinite programming ( sdp ) is minimizing active power loss  @xcite .",
    "this addresses the convergence failure of iterative methods but has its own serious drawbacks .",
    "first , the relaxation may not be tight and yield a high rank matrix where it is impossible to directly recover any solution to the original power flow , let alone the desirable one .",
    "second , if the solution of the relaxed problem is high rank , nothing can be concluded on the feasibility of the power flow in the same vein as non - convergence of iterative methods can not rule out the existence of solutions .",
    "third , the suggested heuristic , i.e. active power loss minimization , does not always find the stable / high voltage solution branch .",
    "the first two problems can be remedied , at least in theory , by obtaining higher - order and thus tighter relaxations of  .",
    "the computation cost , however , explodes with the order of relaxation and the number of variables .",
    "reference  @xcite discusses the theoretical underpinning of this approach in the context of the generalized moment problem and highlights its connection to _ real algebraic geometry _ which , we see as an obstacle to distinguishing the desirable solution branch for algebraic problems of a complex analytic nature .    among the above issues , the challenge of finding the solution on the desirable branch , more than anything else , underlines the significance of embedding the power flow problem in the complex plane where the extraordinary potentials of analytic continuation theory for multi - valued complex functions can be tapped .",
    "this is pioneered by the idea of holomorphic embedding load flow ( helm ) which builds on the fact that under no load / no generation condition ( @xmath24 ) , the network has a trivial non - zero solution for voltage phasors .",
    "this corresponds to all currents @xmath8 being zero and reference voltage @xmath25 propagated across the network and defines the germ of the stable / high voltage branch .",
    "analytic continuation of this germ is guaranteed by monodromy theorem to yield the desirable solution all the way to the closest bifurcation in the parameter space of   where there is a non - trivial monodromy and the physically meaningful solution ceases to exist .",
    "although the idea of helm has aroused significant interest in the power system community , it yet has to prove its superiority over conventional methods . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate how the magnitude of complex variables can be held fixed while preserving the framework of holomorphicity .",
    "this is an important step in the embedding of power flow as it models the action of network controllers in the complex plane .",
    "we also show the indispensable role of pad approximants especially for the case of voltage controllers that fix the magnitude but not the argument of voltage phasors . throughout the paper",
    "we refer to this method as pa to highlight the central role of rational approximation of functions of a complex variable for recovering the power flow solution . with this abbreviation",
    "we also want to emphasize the critical direction of research for further development of this method . in section",
    "ii we succinctly review the main ideas of helm as presented in the original paper  @xcite , i.e. for the pq buses , introduce the concept of rational approximation of analytic functions in relation to power series and continued fractions and explore the zero - pole structure of pad approximants for a 3-bus example . in section iii",
    "we introduce the mathematical _",
    "static _ model of the most prevalent controller in the network , the automatic voltage regulator ( avr ) of the generator .",
    "we demonstrate through modification of the previous 3-bus network , this time with a generator ( pv bus ) , how the approximation of functions of a single complex variable is essential for analytic continuation of the voltage phasors with fixed magnitude .",
    "we interpret the zero - pole structure of pad approximants and its transformation as the solution reaches the feasibility boundary and explain the significance of the zero - pole distribution of the pad approximants in terms of voltage stability margin at a given operating point . in section",
    "iv we demonstrate the superiority of the pa over conventional and recently developed methods of solving the power flow problem . we introduce a 7-bus network where newton - raphson either fails to converge or converges to an unstable / low voltage solution as the active power output of a given generator changes .",
    "we also show that in this network first - order semidefinite relaxation only obtains the solution in a small subset of the stable solution branch and the second - order ( moment ) relaxation obtains the false solution branches .",
    "the numerical results of these methods are contrasted with that of the pa method which consistently obtains the stable / high voltage solution whenever it exists and declares the non - existence of a physically meaningful solution beyond the closest saddle - node bifurcation . in this network",
    "the zero - pole distribution of the pad approximants depicts the analytic structure of the voltage phasors and confirms the general pattern of voltage stability margin observed in section iii . in section",
    "v we summarize the key contributions of the paper and outline the ongoing work .",

    "degenerate cases where the equations of   define not an algebraic curve but a higher - dimension algebraic variety can only arise when the power flow problem is ill - defined as in the case of networks with disconnected graphs .",

    "the equations of   generate an ideal and give a starting basis for finding the corresponding reduced groebner basis  @xcite . for any lexicographic order , such as @xmath35 , this gives a last basis element which is a bivariate polynomial @xmath36 for well - defined problems .",

    "in this paper we have presented a method of solving the algebraic equations of ac power flow with voltage magnitude constraints .",
    "we started by parameterizing the system of equations in the complex plane .",
    "this , under the assumption of the algebraic independence of the equations , renders the complex variables , i.e. voltage and power phasors , algebraic in @xmath48 , the complex parameter , and hence expressible as power series in terms of @xmath48 .",
    "these power series are in fact taylor expansions around a trivial solution which defines the germ of the physically realizable and stable solution branch .",
    "the radius of convergence of these series is determined by the closest branch point of the algebraic curves that are given as the reduced groebner basis of the parameterized system of equations .",
    "we demonstrated the pivotal role of pad approximants in analytically continuing the germ beyond the region of convergence of the series up to a point of non - trivial monodromy .",
    "this enabled the recovery of the physical solution to voltage and power phasors from the divergent power series .",
    "equally important was the analysis of the zero - pole distribution of the pad approximants that reveals the analytic structure of the complex variables .",
    "we illustrated how the concentration of zeros and poles form the stahl s compact set and that the branch point highlighted by the accumulation of zero - poles on the positive real axis serves as a proximity index to power flow infeasibility or voltage collapse .",
    "thus pa method can definitively determine whether a physically realizable and stable solution exists or not .",
    "next we demonstrated the superiority of the pa method over the conventional newton - raphson and the recently developed semidefinite relaxation methods in the context of a 7-bus network .",
    "newton - raphson , by far the most prevalent method in power industry , can be highly unreliable as the feasibility boundary is approached .",
    "it can also converge to solutions that are physically unrealizable and should thus be discarded as false . on the other hand ,",
    "semidefinite relaxation methods are superior to newton - raphson in the sense that they do not exhibit erratic convergence behavior .",
    "we are aware of cases where , unlike the 7-bus network examined here , moment relaxation performs substantially better than newton - raphson in finding the stable branch . however ,",
    "in general sdp methods can also fail , i.e. the relaxation is not sufficiently tight , or may consistently find the false branches .",
    "while the performance of these optimization methods can potentially be improved by better choices of objective function or adding extra constraints , we argue that the tendency to find false branches is a fundamental limitation of semidefinite relaxation methods which have their origins in real algebraic geometry and therefore can not utilize the elegant concepts of analytic continuation and monodromy to solve problems of a complex analytic nature .",
    "we are currently investigating the generic structure of the stahl s compact set for the parameterized algebraic equations of power flow and the effectiveness of pa near the feasibility boundary .",
    "we will disseminate our findings in subsequent publications .",
