    "the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno )  @xcite is a new heavy water ( d@xmath0o ) erenkov solar neutrino detector .",
    "the detector is unique in its use of 1000 tonnes of d@xmath0o  as target , which allows the detection of electron neutrinos and neutrinos of all active flavours through the following channels : @xmath8 this ability to measure the total flux of all active flavours of neutrinos originating from the sun will allow sno to make a model - independent test of the neutrino oscillation hypothesis .",
    "the sno collaboration needs a high energy calibration point beyond the @xmath9b solar neutrino energy endpoint of @xmath1015  mev .",
    "this calibration point is very important in understanding the detector s energy response because erenkov light production is not exactly linear in energy ( e.g. energy loss to low energy electrons below the crenkov threshold ) . as the energy increases , the probability that a photomultiplier tube would get hit by more than one erenkov photon increases .",
    "therefore , a calibration point beyond the solar neutrino energy endpoint will provide vital information on this multiple hit effect at energies beyond the solar neutrino endpoint .    in the arsenal of calibration sources at sno ,",
    "the `` @xmath5 '' source , which employs the @xmath2h(@xmath3)@xmath4he  reaction to generate 19.8-mev gamma rays , has the highest energy .",
    "this @xmath5  source is the first self - contained , compact , and portable high energy gamma - ray source ( @xmath710  mev ) .    in this",
    "paper various aspects of the construction and operation of the @xmath5  source are described . in section  [ sec : design_criteria ] the design criteria for a high energy gamma - ray calibration source at sno are outlined .",
    "attributes of the @xmath2h(@xmath3)@xmath4he  reaction are discussed in section  [ sec : attributes ] . in section  [ sec :",
    "design ] , the design of the @xmath5  source is described .",
    "details involving the fabrication of the scandium tritide target and the assembly of the @xmath5  source are summarized in section  [ sec : construction ] .",
    "the experimental setups used in measuring the neutron and the gamma - ray output of the @xmath5  source are described in section  [ sec : experimental ] .",
    "the results of these measurements can be found in section  [ sec : n_g_yield ] , followed by the conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "one way to calibrate the high - energy response ( 10@xmath1120  mev ) of a large water erenkov detector like sno is to use high - energy gamma rays generated from radiative - capture reactions induced by a particle beam .",
    "the devices that provide these high - energy gamma rays must be compact enough to be maneuvered to different regions in the d@xmath0o  volume using the sno calibration source manipulator system . the largest insertion port for calibration devices at sno can accommodate devices up to about 30  cm in diameter and 75  cm in length .",
    "this physical constraint limits the actual size of such calibration devices .    because the sno detector is essentially a 100% efficient , 4@xmath12 detector to gamma rays in the solar neutrino energy regime , one does not need to design a high - energy source with a high gamma - ray production rate .",
    "the centroid of the photopeak can be measured to better than 1% in less than an hour with a gamma - ray yield of 0.2  s@xmath13 .",
    "sno is designed to run with mgcl@xmath0 loaded in the heavy water to detect the free neutron in reaction ( [ eq : nc ] ) .",
    "the high energy gamma - ray source is required to have a low neutron production rate .",
    "this will minimize the signal interference of the gamma rays resulting from thermal neutron capture by @xmath14cl in d@xmath0o  in the `` salt '' running scenario and the dead time in the data acquisition system .",
    "a neutron production of less than 10@xmath4  s@xmath13 is needed for the design goal of @xmath150.2  @xmath16  s@xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath5  source must be available to calibrate the sno detector whenever there is a change to the detector configuration , or when a high energy calibration is called for .",
    "an operational lifetime of @xmath1560  hours for the @xmath5  source will be more than enough to calibrate the sno detector during its anticipated life span",
    ".    electromagnetic interference between this high energy calibration source and the photomultiplier tube array must be minimal .",
    "for this reason , accelerator sources like the @xmath5  source have to be run in direct current mode , instead of pulsed mode , to eliminate possible electromagnetic pickup by the photomultiplier tube array .",
    "the @xmath17h(p,@xmath16)@xmath18he reaction ( see for example , refs .  @xcite and  @xcite ) has a q - value of 19.8  mev .",
    "since @xmath18he does not have a bound excited state , the gamma ray emitted in this reaction is monoenergetic .",
    "building a compact gamma - ray calibration source using this reaction is an attractive proposal for several reasons .",
    "first of all , the projectile and the target have unit charge .",
    "therefore , the effect of coulomb suppression on the cross section for this reaction is less than reactions with other combinations of charged projectiles and targets .",
    "hence , the beam energy and power can be minimised .",
    "this allows the beam to be run in a d.c .",
    "mode without incorporating a complicated cooling system for the target .    as the q - value of @xmath17h(p ,",
    "n)@xmath17he is -0.763 mev , the @xmath5  source is essentially neutron - free if the proton energy is below this threshold .",
    "however , isotopic impurities and the isotopic exchange between the beam and the target will give rise to undesirable neutrons through the @xmath19h(t , n)@xmath4he , @xmath2h(d , n)@xmath4he , and @xmath2h(t , nn)@xmath4he  reactions . in principle",
    ", one can eliminate this neutron production problem by mass analyzing the beam .",
    "however , this option is not possible in the @xmath5  source given the physical size constraint mentioned in the last section .",
    "a monoenergetic calibration source like the @xmath5  source is better than sources with multiple energy lines in calibrating water erenkov detectors which generally have poor energy resolution .",
    "in order to keep the system as clean as possible , the @xmath5  source was built with ultra - high vacuum ( uhv ) hardware .",
    "a cross sectional drawing of the @xmath5  source can be found in figure  [ fig : source_dwg ] .",
    "the source can essentially be divided into three sections : the gas - discharge line , the ion acceleration line and the target chamber . in the following , the design of these three sections is discussed .",
    "the gas - discharge line is a cold - cathode penning ion source , which runs in d.c .",
    "mode with a very modest power consumption .",
    "the outer housing of the gas - discharge line consists of two glass - to - stainless - steel adapters .",
    "each of these adapters is 7.62  cm in length with a piece of 1.27-cm long pyrex glass to isolate the two ends .",
    "the electrodes e1 , e2 and e3 are welded to these adapters .",
    "the use of these glass - to - stainless - steel adapters provides convenient high voltage isolation between the anode and the cathodes .",
    "the placement of the various electrodes in the gas - discharge line was designed using the simulation program macsimion  @xcite . in the design",
    ", efforts were made to minimise ion loss to the electrode walls ; hence , a higher beam current can be attained for a given discharge current .",
    "the beam was spread over the target ; this reduces the areal power density and improves the target s longevity . under the normal running scenario ,",
    "the cathodes ( e1 and e3 ) are kept at ground , whilst the anode ( e2 ) is maintained at + 2  kv d.c .",
    "a saes st-172 getter ( model lhi/4 - 7/200 ) is used as the hydrogen discharge gas reservoir for the ion source .",
    "the getter has 360  mg of a zirconium - vanadium - iron alloy active material , and is mounted to the bnc connector next to e1 in figure  [ fig : source_dwg ] .",
    "the axial magnetic field required in the discharge is provided by a cylindrical magnet composed of seven 13.34  cm ( outer diameter ) by 5.88  cm ( inner diameter ) by 1.91  cm ( thick ) barium ferrite feroxdur ceramic rings .",
    "the maximum magnetic field inside the central bore of the magnet is about 0.06  t.    the ion acceleration line is a double - ended glass adapter , with one end attached to the gas - discharge line and the other connected to the target chamber which is biased at a negative high voltage . in this scheme ,",
    "the construction of complicated accelerating and focusing electrodes is avoided , and the length can also be kept to a minimum . when the ions exit this acceleration line and enter the target chamber , they have acquired an energy equivalent to the target bias voltage , in addition to their ejection energy from the ion discharge region",
    ".    at the end of the ion acceleration line in the @xmath5  source is the target mount flange .",
    "the target is secured to a copper heat sink , as shown protruding from the flange in figure  [ fig : source_dwg ] , by a stainless steel screw - on cap .",
    "this mounting mechanism is designed to allow efficient target mounting in the tritium glovebox in which this operation is to be performed .",
    "the total length of the @xmath5  source is only 50  cm . for deployment in sno",
    ", it will be housed inside a 25.4-cm diameter by 60-cm long stainless steel cylindrical deployment capsule .",
    "the dimensions of this capsule are well within the physical limits imposed by the sno calibration - source - deployment hardware .",
    "the expected yield of the @xmath5  source was calculated . because the cross section of the @xmath2h(@xmath3)@xmath4he  reaction below 50  kev is not well known",
    ", the cross section at the operating voltage of the @xmath5  source had to be extrapolated from existing data .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the long - wavelength approximation formalism developed in christy and duck  @xcite is inadequate in describing the @xmath2h(@xmath3)@xmath4he  cross section at low energies because of the reaction s exceptionally high binding energy . using the lowest energy data ( @xmath20  mev ) from hahn  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , the reaction cross section @xmath21 was extracted by performing a @xmath22 minimization of the s - factor @xmath23 , which is related to the cross section @xmath21 as  @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the energy in the center of mass frame , and @xmath26 is the gamow energy .",
    "because @xmath23 is expected to be a slowly varying function at low energy , it was fitted to the data as a power series : @xmath27 where the parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 were extracted .",
    "details of the extrapolation can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : s_factors ] , the extrapolated @xmath23 for the @xmath2h(@xmath3)@xmath4he  reaction is shown .",
    "the values of the fitted parameters are listed in table  [ table : s_fitting ] .",
    "the cross section at proton energies of 25  kev and 30  kev are 0.19  @xmath31b and 0.30  @xmath31b respectively .",
    "the stopping power required in the yield calculation was calculated using the program srim  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : estimated_pt_yield ] shows the estimated gamma - ray yield as a function of the the mass-1 content in a 50-@xmath31a , 27-kev beam in the constructed @xmath5  source .",
    "this calculation assumed a total mixing of hydrogen isotopes between the beam and the target .",
    "the ion beam current was measured _ in situ _ by a calorimetric method and by a faraday cup fitted with a secondary electron suppression scheme .",
    "these measurements were made with extra hardware installed in the target chamber of an untritiated model @xmath5  source . in the calorimetric method ,",
    "the temperature of a copper target , in which a heater was embedded to calibrate the beam power  @xcite , was monitored .",
    "beam current measured by both methods agreed with each other .",
    "the @xmath5  source is capable of generating at least 50@xmath31a of total ( atomic and molecular ) beam current at a beam energy of 20  kev .",
    "the mass composition of the beam was also measured _ in situ _ by lengthening the target chamber and installing a home - built mass spectrometer in the model source .",
    "the mass-1 composition was determined to be ( 0.63@xmath60.09 ) in the h@xmath0 partial pressure range of 0.3@xmath3210@xmath33 to 0.6@xmath3210@xmath33  mbar , which is a factor of @xmath105 lower than the normal operating pressure of the @xmath5source .",
    "the normal operating pressure of the source was chosen by considering the beam stability and longevity running in a continuous mode .",
    "the mass composition measurement could not be made at the normal operating h@xmath0 pressure of the source due to increased beam scattering in the lengthened target chamber and the inadequate resolution of the spectrometer .",
    "the most common metal hydride films use titanium as the `` sorbent ''  @xcite . singleton and yannopoulos",
    "@xcite measured the loss rate of tritium in titanium tritide , yttrium tritide and scandium tritide films at elevated temperatures under several different ambient environments .",
    "it was demonstrated that both yttrium and scandium films have a lower tritium loss rate than titanium films under the testing conditions .",
    "although this study was performed using moderately loaded tritiated films ( y:@xmath2h and sc:@xmath2h ratios were @xmath101:1 ) , this general observation of scandium tritide films having very good thermal stability is believed to hold even for heavily loaded films .",
    "this property is essential for a target system which does not have an external cooling mechanism like the @xmath5  source .",
    "molybdenum was chosen as the substrate for the scandium film because of the strong adhesion between the two materials  @xcite . to ensure high adhesion strength of the scandium film to the molybdenum substrate ,",
    "it was prepared by going through a series of mechanical and chemical treatments prior to film deposition .",
    "a substrate disc of diameter 2.86  cm was first cut out from a 1-mm thick sheet of 99.95% pure molybdenum using the electro - discharge machining ( edm ) technique .",
    "this was to minimise the use of machining oil on the substrate .",
    "the substrate was then sandblasted by fine glass beads in order to increase its effective surface area and enhance the film adhesion strength .",
    "the scandium film would peel off much more easily from a non - roughened substrate surface .",
    "the substrate was then treated chemically in a multi - stage process .",
    "it was first cleansed in acetone in an ultrasonic bath for half an hour .",
    "the substrate was subsequently ultrasonically cleansed in ethanol , then deionised water , for half an hour in each solvent .",
    "this sequence of chemical cleansing ensured that hydrocarbons that might have deposited on the substrate during the edm process to be removed .",
    "the substrate surface was then etched in a 3  m nitric acid bath for 30  seconds .",
    "the whole chemical cleansing process was completed by a 30-minute deionised water wash in an ultrasonic bath .",
    "once the substrate had gone through this series of preparation processes , it was mounted to a copper holder in which a 110-w coil heater was embedded and placed inside the ultra - high vacuum ( uhv ) evaporation system which is described below .",
    "the mo substrate was centered on the 2.54-cm diameter central aperture of the holder .",
    "this heater block was outfitted with thermocouples for temperature monitoring .",
    "the substrate was baked at 400@xmath34c in the evaporation system for about four days , then at 250@xmath34c for about a week to reduce outgassing from its surface .",
    "fabrication of the scandium tritide target , and the subsequent assembly of the @xmath5  source were performed at the tritium laboratory at ontario hydro technologies ( oht ) in toronto , ontario , canada .",
    "the schematic of the vacuum system is shown in figure  [ fig : oht_vacuum_system ] . to ensure that a high vacuum could be achieved in this tritium run ,",
    "oil - free vacuum pumps and uhv hardware were used in this system .",
    "the evaporation chamber is a uhv six - way cross with an outer flange diameter of 15.24  cm .",
    "the tritium - compatible glovebox is continuously purged with dry nitrogen .",
    "the moisture level in the glovebox is typically 30 to 50  ppm by volume .",
    "the nitrogen purge gas is routed through a zr@xmath0fe tritium trap in order to remove its tritium content before venting  @xcite .",
    "the exhaust of the vacuum system is also routed through a zr@xmath0fe trap before venting .",
    "two high - current feedthroughs were connected to the evaporation chamber .",
    "a 5-coil conical tungsten evaporation basket was mounted between these feedthroughs .",
    "a ( 26@xmath61)-mg lump of 99.99% pure , sublimed dendritic scandium was placed inside this basket , and positioned directly above the molybdenum substrate in the heater block .",
    "the separation between the bottom of the tungsten basket and the molybdenum substrate was ( 14@xmath62 )  mm .",
    "a stainless steel shroud that had an orifice directly below the evaporation basket was positioned around the feedthrough - basket assembly to prevent deposition on the viewport in the evaporation chamber and to reflect radiation back to the coil to enhance heating efficiency .",
    "a quartz oscillator was installed at the end of an evaporator bellows as shown in the setup in figure  [ fig : oht_vacuum_system ] . when the deposition assembly is inserted into the evaporation chamber",
    ", the oscillator can be lowered to the back side of the assembly through an aperture in the main shroud and used to monitor the deposition rate of scandium .",
    "the distance between the scandium source ( in the tungsten evaporation basket ) and the oscillator was 27  cm .    as shown in figure [ fig : oht_vacuum_system ]",
    ", there are two main gas lines connected to the evaporation chamber in the vacuum system of the setup .",
    "one of these branches is connected to a 5-g depleted uranium bed .",
    "this uranium bed is used to store tritium which can be readily desorbed by raising it to sufficiently high temperature  @xcite . in table",
    "[ table : tritium_gas_composition ] , the isotopic purity of the tritium gas in this bed is shown .",
    "prior to film evaporation , the whole apparatus was baked for over a week at @xmath10150 - 200  @xmath34c to reduce the outgassing rate of the evaporation system .",
    "the tungsten evaporation coil was also baked by running a 10  a current through it .",
    "the base pressure of the system was @xmath106@xmath3210@xmath35  mbar during the bakeout .",
    "after the baking , the evaporation system reached a base pressure of 5.8@xmath3210@xmath36  mbar .",
    "after bakeout , the deposition assembly ( i.e. the high current feedthrough - evaporation basket assembly ) was delivered into the evaporation chamber by winding in the linear translation stage to which the deposition assembly flange was connected .",
    "the tungsten evaporation basket was positioned directly above the centre of the molybdenum substrate .",
    "the current fed to the tungsten basket was raised at a rate of about 1  a  min@xmath13 during the first thirty minutes of the experiment .",
    "this rate was then decreased to 0.2  a  min@xmath13 to lower the outgassing rate of the evaporation hardware .",
    "the basket current was raised up to 46  a , at which point the coil temperature was @xmath101900  @xmath34c .",
    "this was to ensure that all the scandium , whose melting point is 1539  @xmath34c , was evaporated .",
    "immediately after the scandium deposition , the deposition assembly was removed from the evaporation chamber by winding out the linear translation stage and closing a gate valve ( v2 in figure [ fig : oht_vacuum_system ] ) .",
    "before tritium was let into the evaporation chamber , the evaporation chamber was isolated by closing the remaining gate valves ( v1 and v3 in figure [ fig : oht_vacuum_system ] ) connected to it .",
    "these two steps would reduce the amount of tritium used in the subsequent tritiation process .",
    "the molybdenum substrate temperature was subsequently raised to 400  @xmath34c to enhance tritium sorption by the scandium film later on .",
    "the uranium tritide bed was first heated to 135  @xmath34c to drive out the @xmath2he from tritium decay in the bed .",
    "at this temperature , tritium is still `` locked '' inside the bed .",
    "the released @xmath2he was first pumped out of the system before the uranium bed temperature was raised to 220 - 240  @xmath34c at which temperature the tritium is desorbed . in order to measure the amount of tritium sorbed by the scandium film , the tritium gas released from the uranium bed was first trapped in the small volume between valves v6 and v10 ( see figure [ fig : oht_vacuum_system ] ) before releasing to the isolated evaporation chamber .",
    "this trap has a volume of ( 31.9@xmath62.2 )  cm@xmath2 . with the tritium pressure measured by the pressure transducer connected to this volume , the amount of tritium used",
    "could then be determined . in figure",
    "[ fig : sct2_tritiation ] the pressure inside the evaporation chamber is plotted against the time after doses 1 , 7 , 9 and 13 were injected .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the sorbing capacity of the scandium film decreased as the tritium concentration in the film increased .",
    "a total of ( 8.19@xmath60.57 )  ci of tritium gas was injected in 13 different doses into the chamber .",
    "it was found that 89.9% of the tritium that was injected into the chamber was absorbed by the ( 5.7@xmath60.6 )  mg scandium film on the target heater block .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath2h / sc atomic ratio of ( 2.0@xmath60.2 ) .",
    "the target substrate subtended a smaller solid angle than the heater block to which the substrate was mounted . after correcting for the solid angle ,",
    "the tritium activity on the target substrate was found to be ( 3.3@xmath60.8 )  ci .",
    "the ion source must be cleansed before it could accept the tritiated target .",
    "if the outgassing rate of the ion source is too high , the getter would lose most of its capacity on pumping the residual gas in the source , rather than serving its purpose as the hydrogen discharge gas reservoir .",
    "the ion source was cleansed chemically and mounted to a tritium - free bakeout system .",
    "the ion source was baked at 150  @xmath34c for about two weeks .",
    "the bakeout vacuum system was flushed with argon for approximately 5 to 10 minutes daily during this bakeout period .",
    "this flushing procedure did improve the overall cleanliness of the vacuum system .",
    "after the target fabrication , the ion source was removed from the bakeout system and wrapped in layers of parafilm@xmath38 which is a flexible , thermoplastic material .",
    "it was used to minimise tritiated particles depositing on the outer surface of the ion source once it was taken into the glovebox where the target evaporation system was set up .",
    "the tritiated target was removed from the evaporation system and mounted to the @xmath5  source .",
    "the ion source was then connected to the vacuum system as indicated in figure [ fig : oht_vacuum_system ] .",
    "after the system had reached its base pressure , h@xmath0 was let into the system , and an ion beam was allowed to strike and to bombard the target for 5 minutes . during this time , the beam energy was gradually increased from 0 to 25  kev .",
    "this procedure was necessary to cleanse the penning electrodes by electro - discharge .",
    "contamination on the target , which might have deposited on the target surface during the target mounting process , would also be removed by this brief beam bombardment .",
    "it was found that if this step were not carried out , the getter in the source would not be able to handle the residual gas load in the source once sealed .",
    "the st-172 getter had to be activated before loading hydrogen to it . to activate the getter , it was heated for 10 minutes at 800@xmath34c by passing a 4.5  a current through it .",
    "once activated , the getter current was lowered to about 1.6  a in order to maintain a temperature of 200@xmath34c .",
    "the getter was then loaded with hydrogen by allowing an ambient h@xmath0 pressure of 3.3@xmath3210@xmath39  mbar into the ion source .",
    "after 30 minutes , @xmath10200  cm@xmath2  mbar of h@xmath0 would have been absorbed by the 360  mg of active material in the getter .",
    "the getter loading procedure was completed by turning off the getter current , and by pumping out the residual h@xmath0 gas in the ion source .",
    "after the base pressure was reached , the source was isolated and detached from the rest of the vacuum system by closing the metal - seal valve on the source .",
    "the source was subsequently removed from the glove box , and its outer surface was de - contaminated .",

    "it was found that the @xmath5  source hardware absorbed or scattered @xmath67  % of the neutrons that are generated inside the source .    because there was a variation in beam intensity on target from run to run , the neutron production rate was normalised to the current drawn from the target bias supply in order to provide a fair comparison .",

    "reaction ( [ eqn : ttnone ] ) is a sequential decay proceeding through a broad @xmath73he excited state at about 2  mev .",

    "for the @xmath2h(d , n)@xmath4he  reaction , the angular distribution is isotropic at and below the resonance @xcite .",
    "given these facts , the assumption that the neutrons emitted by the @xmath5  source are isotropic was made in the yield evaluation .    in order to look at the time variation of the neutron production rate by the @xmath5  source more closely , the neutron production rates for all the runs were renormalised to the same atomic beam energy at 29  kev .",
    "in other words , the rate in all of the @xmath74=22  kev and 27  kev runs were scaled up by a factor corresponding to the difference in cross section at that atomic beam energy to that at 29  kev . the resulting plot is shown in figure  [ fig : neutron_generation_scaled ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : neutron_generation_scaled ] , it is clear how the neutron production rate in the @xmath5  source varied over time .",
    "the neutron production rate was gradually increasing initially .",
    "this is a clear indication of beam - target exchange , as tritium in the target gets into the discharge gas stream .",
    "the neutron production rate then began to decrease .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the rate of hydrogen isotope exchange was reaching an equilibrium , and sputtering of the target became the dominant process .",
    "the target sputtering effect had caused the build - up of a thin film on the high voltage insulator in the acceleration section of the source . under the normal operating condition , one end of this insulator",
    "is grounded whilst the other end is biased at @xmath10 - 30  kv . with a thin conductive film build - up on the insulator , high voltage could no longer be maintained without breakdown .",
    "this build - up effect limited the lifetime of the @xmath5  source to 98.8  hours[pg : sputter_target ] .",

    "the neutron production rate by the @xmath5  source is also low enough that the neutron background would not mask the gamma - ray signal during calibration . because of the time variation of its output , this @xmath5  source is not suitable for efficiency calibration .",
    "the operational lifetime of the @xmath5  source was 98.8  hours .",
