    "the most general class of non - static , perfect fluid solutions of einstein s equations that are conformally flat is known as the``stephani universe''@xcite,@xcite .",
    "these mathematicaly simple solutions are characterized ( in general ) by a shear - free but expanding and accelerating 4-velocity , with perfect fluid flrw spacetimes being the acceleration free subcase .",
    "the sphericaly symmetric stephani universes and some of their subcases have been examined in numerous papers ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "for example , as star models @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite and as cosmologies generalizing flrw@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "other papers have looked at their global properties and singularities@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite , the thermodynamics of their fluid source @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , and , more recently , as models with inhomogeneous pressure in which to test recent astronomical data related to supernova observations@xcite,@xcite . although these solutions are popular because of their mathematical simplicity , they are not considered physicaly meaningful because their fluid source seems quite artificial and excessively restrictive : matter - energy density , @xmath1 , depends only on @xmath2 while pressure , @xmath3 , depends on @xmath2 and @xmath4 ( in comoving coordinates ) .",
    "another objection to the stephani universes is their incompatibility with a barotropic relation@xcite,@xcite of the form @xmath5 .",
    "however , the lack of fulfilment of barotropic relations is not a strong argument to dismiss a given fluid solution , since the latter might be compatible with more meaningful non - barotropic equations of state .",
    "the thermodynamics of the fluid source of the stephani universes is given by the balance equations of energy , momentum and entropy per particle , as well as by the particle number conservation and the equilibrium gibbs equation .",
    "previous papers have shown that the general stephani universe , having as source a single component perfect fluid , is incompatible with the integrability conditions of the gibbs equation@xcite,@xcite , so that a `` thermodynamical scheme '' is not possible ( or in other words , a mathematicaly consistent and closed set of thermodynamical equations of state is incompatible with the field equations ) . however",
    ", this restriction does not apply to the sphericaly symmetric case , or to any subcase whose isometry group has orbits of dimension 2 or larger , hence mathematicaly simple equations of state have been found@xcite satisfying energy conditions , but without any basis on actual physical matter models .    accepting the above mentioned limitations",
    ", this paper aims at looking for a reasonable ( or at least , less objectionable ) interpretation for the stephani universes . using the gibbs equation as a definition of temperature , @xmath6",
    ", it is posible to determine the four free functions by imposing the constraint : @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is particle number density and @xmath9 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "however , the fulfilment of the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath3 characteristic of the equation of state of the ideal gas@xcite ( together with @xmath0 ) can not hold because @xmath10 while @xmath11 .",
    "we consider the equations of state of : ( a ) a single component classical monatomic ideal gas , and ( b ) a mixture of non - relativistic and relativistic ideal gases , where the internal energy of the former has been ignored ( hence , @xmath3 and @xmath6 are the radiation pressure and temperature ) . by writing up the explicit form of the state variables for the forms of the free functions that satisfy @xmath0 , we provide explicitly the conditions for a tight approximation to the full equations of state ( a ) and ( b ) in terms of the convergence of a series of powers of adimensional products of @xmath1 and a parameter @xmath12 , proportional to the energy ratio @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a suitable constant temperature value and @xmath15 is the particles mass .",
    "this series converges in a matter dominated low temperature regime characterized by @xmath16 , for models having spacelike slices ( hypersurfaces of constant @xmath2 , orthogonal to the 4-velocity ) with constant positive curvature ( like `` closed '' flrw cosmologies ) . under this approximation ,",
    "the evolution of the fluid in the matter dominated regime becomes very close to a dust flrw cosmology , to such a degree that observational parameters @xmath17 become practicaly indistinguishable from those of the flrw spacetime .",
    "the same models for which the above mentioned series converges are the only ones admiting an evolution range that avoids unphysical features , such as a  finite density  singularity and an `` asymptoticaly desitter boundary''(see @xcite to @xcite ) , and so allowing for a regular initial cauchy hypersurface .",
    "models whose spacelike slices orthogonal to the 4-velocity have zero or negative curvature lack a regular cauchy hypersurface , while the series governing the approximation to the ideal gas equations of state ( a ) and ( b ) only converge for comoving observers near the symmetry center @xmath18 .    considering their qualities and defects ,",
    "the subclass of stephani universes derived and discussed in the present paper provide a reasonable and theoreticaly consistent interpretation for this simple and well established class of exact solutions .",
    "the metric in comoving coordinates for the sphericaly symmetric stephani universes is usualy given in such a way as to emphasize its resemblance with flrw cosmologies@xcite .",
    "however , we shall use instead the following alternative comoving coordinates :    @xmath19\\eqno(1a)\\ ] ] @xmath20    where @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and the functions @xmath24 are given by the three possible combinations @xmath25    the transformation of the radial coordinate @xmath4 , relating ( 1)-(2 ) with the usual radial coordinate for the stephani universes , @xmath26 , is given by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",

    "these balance and conservation laws take the following forms for ( 1 ) and ( 2 )    @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the proper time derivative for any scalar function @xmath46 and @xmath47 are given by ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) .",
    "the state variables must also comply with the equilibrium gibbs equation    @xmath48    where @xmath6 is absolute temperature .",
    "the field equation @xmath49 for ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) is    @xmath50    where : @xmath51    while the form of @xmath3 follows from ( 7a ) as @xmath52     \\eqno(11)\\ ] ]    the momentum ballance ( 7b ) is    @xmath53 ^ 2}}=0\\eqno(12)\\ ] ]    where a prime denotes derivative wrt to @xmath4 and ( 6 ) and ( 11 ) were used to eliminate @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",

    "since the spacial coordinates in ( 1 ) are comoving , the entropy balance ( 7d ) yields simply @xmath58 , and so , with the help of ( 7a ) and ( 7c ) , the gibbs equation ( 8) reduces to    @xmath59    with @xmath60 , since the fluid of stephani universes is not isentropic ( or equivalently , does not admit a barotropic relation @xmath5 ) .",
    "the stephani universes contain ( in general ) two time dependent free functions ( @xmath61 in ( 1 ) ) whose determination is elusive .",
    "the imposition of an equation of state ( ie a constraint relating state variables ) should lead to the determination of these free - parameters , howewer not all relations between the state variables is compatible with these free functions and with the radial dependence of the state variables ( in particular , the barotropic relation @xmath5 is incompatible , see @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "conversely , if the two free functions are determined by suitable boundary conditions , or prescribed in order to obtain specific kinematic effects , a specific constraint among state variables ensues , though such constraint is a `` formal '' equation of state and might be wholy unphysical .",
    "the usual boundary conditions invoked for determining the free functions are : a matching with a schwarzschild vacuum exterior along a comoving boundary and/or a relation between @xmath3 and @xmath1 along a symmetry center@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , or the desire to obtain specific kinematic efects , like bouncing @xcite or acceleration of comoving observers@xcite,@xcite , or a metric element that is conformal to that of a flrw metric@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite . besides the time dependent free parameters , a proper thermodynamical approach produces two extra free functions of @xmath4 : the initial particle number distribution , @xmath62 , and the entropy per particle @xmath63 .",
    "the stephani universes , as exact solutions subjected to the thermodynamical laws ( 7c ) , ( 7d ) and ( 8) , become determined once the four free functions @xmath64 are either prescribed , found or obtained . from equations ( 1)-(14 ) , once @xmath1 and @xmath65 are known as functions of @xmath66 , the field equation ( 9 ) becomes the friedmann equation whose integration yields @xmath66 as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "however , the functions @xmath67 can not be determined from the geometry but from thermodynamical criteria .",
    "the usual strategies to determine the free functions have lead , in all cases , to equations of state whose physics has still remained unclear . we propose in this paper another strategy for the determination of these free functions .",
    "consider the following relation associated with the equation of state of an ideal gas : @xmath68 where @xmath9 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "using @xmath69 from ( 11 ) and ( 13 ) , the fulfilment of ( 15 ) implies the constraint    @xmath70    which becomes explicitly @xmath71+rf\\left [ { { { 2k_bf ' } \\over { s'}}k\\rho _ { , r}-\\rho k_{,r}f } \\right]=0\\eqno(16b)\\ ] ] the only physicaly reasonable solution of ( 16 ) ( other solutions yield negative values of @xmath8 and @xmath6 ) follows if the terms in square parenthesis vanish independently .",

    "although this feature is problematic , it is consistent with the fact that an absolute zero temperature ( if @xmath6 is stricly zero instead of @xmath337 asymptoticaly ) is impossible to attain in equilibrium classical thermodynamics@xcite .",
    "this feature ( appearing also for the cases @xmath180 ) is perhaps the strongest drawback on the physical plausibility of the models .      the models derived and presented in this paper are mathematicaly simple , theoreticaly consistent and satisfy physicaly motivated equations of state .",
