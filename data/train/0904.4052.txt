    "the robustness against failures , the wiring cost , and the communication characteristics are key measures of most complex , finite - size real - world networks .",
    "for example , the electrical power grid needs to be robust against a variety of failures , minimize the wiring cost , and minimize the transmission losses .",
    "similarly , the neural circuitry in the human brain requires efficient signal transmission and robustness against damage while being constrained in volume .    in this letter",
    ", we use random boolean networks ( rbns ) as a simple model to study the ( 1 ) robustness , i.e. , the damage spreading , ( 2 ) the wiring cost , and ( 3 ) the communication characteristics as a function of different network topologies ( local , small - world , random ) , different connectivities @xmath2 , and different network sizes @xmath3 .",
    "more generally speaking , this allows us to answer the question of _ how much _ and _ what type _ of interconnectivity a complex network  in our case rbns  needs in order to satisfy given restrictions on the robustness against certain types of failure , the ( wiring ) cost , and the ( communication ) efficiency .",

    "an rbn is discrete dynamical system , also called @xmath4 network ( or model ) , composed of @xmath3 automata ( or nodes ) , each of which receives inputs from @xmath5 ( either exact or average ) randomly chosen other automata .",
    "each automaton is a boolean variable with two possible states : @xmath6 , and the dynamics is such that @xmath7 where @xmath8 , and each @xmath9 is represented by a look - up table of @xmath10 inputs randomly chosen from the set of @xmath3 automata .",
    "initially , @xmath10 neighbors and a look - table are assigned to each automaton at random . @xmath11",
    "an automaton state @xmath12 is updated using its corresponding boolean function : @xmath13 we randomly initialize the states of the automata ( initial condition of the rbn ) .",
    "the automata are updated synchronously using their corresponding boolean functions .",

    "the study of the response of complex dynamical networks to external perturbations , also referred to as damage , has numerous applications , e.g. , the spreading of disease through a population @xcite , the spreading of a computer virus on the internet @xcite , failure propagation in power grids @xcite , the perturbation of gene expression patterns in a cell due to mutations @xcite , or the intermittent stationary state in economic decision networks triggered by the mutation of strategy from a few individual agents @xcite .",
    "mean - field approaches , e.g. , the annealed approximation ( aa ) introduced by derrida and pomeau @xcite , allow for an analytical treatment of damage spreading and exact determination of the critical connectivity @xmath15 under various constraints @xcite . however , these approximations rely on the assumption that @xmath16 , which , for an application to real - world problems , is often an irrelevant limit .",
    "a number of studies @xcite has recently focused on the finite - size scaling of ( un-)frozen and/or relevant nodes in rbn with respect to @xmath3 with the goal to go beyond the annealed approximation .",
    "only a few studies , however , consider finite - size scaling of damage spreading in rbns @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the `` sparse percolation ( sp ) limit ''",
    "@xcite , where the initial perturbation size @xmath17 does _ not _ scale up with the network size @xmath3 , i.e. , the relative size of perturbations tends to zero for large @xmath3 . in @xcite rohlf",

    "this limit is particularly relevant to information and damage propagation in many technological and natural networks .",
    "the work in this letter extends these new findings and systematically studies damage spreading in rbns as a function of new network topologies , namely local and small - world , different connectivities @xmath2 , and different network sizes @xmath3 .",
    "for our purpose , we measure the expected damage @xmath19 as the hamming distance between two different initial system configurations after a large number of @xmath20 system updates .",

    "the nodes can be classified according to their response to the network dynamics ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "this classification allows to better explain the global network behavior with respect to external perturbations .",
    "a set of nodes is said to be part of the _ frozen component _ ( or _ frozen core _ ) if each node s output is constant regardless of its inputs .",
    "the states of these nodes remain constant on every attractor , so that external perturbations can not spread into the frozen component .",
    "the frozen core does thus not contribute to the damage spreading .",
    "the _ irrelevant nodes _ ( or _ irrelevant component _ ) are the nodes whose outputs may change , but their outputs are only connected to either frozen or other irrelevant nodes .",
    "again , these nodes do not participate in the damage spreading .",
    "the remaining set of nodes are the _ relevant nodes _ ( or _ relevant component _ ) .",
    "their state changes and each relevant node is connected to at least another relevant node .",
    "as their name suggests , the relevant nodes are the crucial ones , which determine the number and the period of attractors in a given network . for our purpose ,",
    "studying the scaling behavior of the relevant component is important for the study of damage spreading because the hamming distance between the damaged and the undamaged network can be viewed as a quantitative measure of the distance between the two different attractors the networks settle in .    in this letter , we use three exemplary types of network topologies : ( 1 ) random , ( 2 ) spatially local , and ( 3 ) small - world . in the following",

    "such networks are commonly called _ complex networks_. spatial networks with local connections only , such as regular grids , have a large average path length ( @xmath63 ) and are highly clustered . in this section ,",
    "we look at the dynamics of spatial rbns with local connections only . the underlying network structure is constructed based on the model of _ uniform spatial graphs _",
    "@xcite , in which vertices may connect uniformly at random to other vertices within a spatial distance @xmath64 in @xmath65 .",
    "we do this as following : @xmath3 nodes are randomly distributed in a @xmath30-dimensional space ( only @xmath66 will be considered here ) , we then randomly pick a pair of nodes @xmath67,@xmath68 and create edge @xmath69 if the spatial distance is within the cut - off distance @xmath64 , disallowing repeated edges .",
    "this procedure is repeated until the required average degree @xmath2 is reached .    for a small cutoff distance , or any finite cutoff when @xmath70 , e.g. , @xmath71 , the characteristic path length remains similar to that of @xmath30-dimensional regular lattices @xcite .",
    "for very large @xmath2 , the system is in the chaotic regime and any initial damage quickly percolates through the network .",
    "thus , the damage is only bounded by the system size @xmath3 , which gives us @xmath72 . in the limit of @xmath73 , nonzero damage can emerge only when the initial perturbation hits a short loop of oscillating nodes .",
    "let us assume we have a single connection from node @xmath74 to node @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) .",

    "we expect to see coinciding hamming distances at low @xmath2 for different system sizes @xmath3 on extremely local networks .",
    "this remains valid until the network reaches the percolation threshold where segregated simple loops become connected and a giant cluster emerges .",
    "furthermore , compared to random networks , the local connections lowered the probability of forming the relevant component at criticality because each relevant node needs to be controlled by another relevant node .",
    "we thus expect that the damage increases slower compared to random networks .",
    "in particular , the exponent is smaller than @xmath83 at @xmath15 because @xmath84 at @xmath15 for random networks @xcite .",
    "[ fig.hd-n](a ) shows the hamming distance as a function of the system size @xmath3 for different connectivities @xmath2 .",

    "this confirms again our assumption of the scaling behavior for low @xmath2 .",
    "both purely random and purely local networks are extreme network topologies .",
    "many biological , technological , and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes and are categorized as `` small - world networks '' @xcite .",
    "small - world networks typically exhibit a number of advantages over locally connected networks , such as a short average path length , synchronizability , and improved robustness against certain types of failures .",
    "it is therefore of fundamental interest to study the damage spreading in rbn networks with a small - world interconnect topology .",
    "starting from the @xmath33 uniform spatial graph we have used above for the locally interconnected network , we apply a simply rewiring strategy to construct a small - world network .",
    "each existing connection in the uniform spatial graph is rewired with probability @xmath34 to a randomly chosen node .",
    "thus , a fraction of @xmath34 links in the network are random long - range links , or small - world links , while the remaining fraction of @xmath89 links are local links connecting geometrically local neighbors .",
    "we will use @xmath90 as the main parameter to represent the `` strength '' of the local connections .",

    "the network is in the random network regime ( see sec [ sec : rand ] ) ; and for @xmath93 we obtain a spatially local network ( see sec [ sec : local ] ) .",
    "we will now use a similar scaling approach for small - world rbns as presented above for local and random networks .",
    "again , at very large @xmath2 , the damage will only be bounded by the system size , thus @xmath94 .",
    "but for @xmath39 , the network is now composed of both local and random ( longer range ) connections and the probability of forming simple loops scales thus differently . let us assume we have a local link that has already been connected ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "the probability of having such a local link is @xmath90 , and to complete a simple loop that contains this local connection , we first need to pick node @xmath75 with probability @xmath96 .",
    "node @xmath75 will then establish connections again with his local neighbors with probability @xmath90 , and finally choose node @xmath74 to finish the loop with probability @xmath97 .",
    "thus , the final probability of having a simple loop in this case scales with @xmath98 .",
    "similarly the probability of generating a simple loop involving random long - range links is @xmath99 .",
    "we compare these two probabilities by dividing one by another : @xmath100 in the spatially local network limit ( @xmath93 ) , @xmath101 is the leading term and the scaling follows eq .",

    "<S> the study of the response of complex dynamical social , biological , or technological networks to external perturbations has numerous applications . </S>",
    "<S> random boolean networks ( rbns ) are commonly used a simple generic model for certain dynamics of complex systems . </S>",
    "<S> traditionally , rbns are interconnected randomly and without considering any spatial extension and arrangement of the links and nodes . </S>",
    "<S> however , most real - world networks are spatially extended and arranged with regular , power - law , small - world , or other non - random connections . here </S>",
    "<S> we explore the rbn network topology between extreme local connections , random small - world , and pure random networks , and study the damage spreading with small perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that spatially local connections change the scaling of the relevant component at very low connectivities ( @xmath0 ) and that the critical connectivity of stability @xmath1 changes compared to random networks . at higher @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> , this scaling remains unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the relevant component of spatially local networks scales with a power - law as the system size n increases , but with a different exponent for local and small - world networks . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling behaviors are obtained by finite - size scaling . </S>",
    "<S> we further investigate the wiring cost of the networks . from an engineering perspective </S>",
    "<S> , our new findings provide the key design trade - offs between damage spreading ( robustness ) , the network s wiring cost , and the network s communication characteristics . </S>"
