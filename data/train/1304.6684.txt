    "in fig .  ( [ asw ] ) , we demonstrate that the compressional solitary wave ( sw ) excitation discovered by nesterenko in a chain of non - cohesive beads is also seen in a lattice of springs with two sided interactions .",

    "is not sustained by beads interacting with purely repulsive potentials  the beads would merely loose contact .    in fig .",

    "the smaller sw / asw s are generated as the particle that initially imparted the impulse , recoils with its left - over energy .",
    "this process is repeated several times , leading to the generation of the train of smaller excitations . since the speed of propagation depends upon the amplitude , the sw and asw that start propagating together initially ( appearing bounded ) , eventually separate and become clearly distinguishable .",

    "<S> we study a chain of anharmonic springs with tunable power law interactions as a minimal model to explore the propagation of strongly non - linear solitary wave excitations in a background of thermal fluctuations . by treating the solitary waves as quasi - particles , we derive an effective langevin equation and obtain their damping rate and thermal diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> these analytical findings compare favorably against numerical results from a langevin dynamic simulation . in our chains composed of two sided non - linear springs , </S>",
    "<S> we report the existence of an expansion solitary wave ( anti - soliton ) in addition to the compressive solitary waves observed for non - cohesive macroscopic particles .    in linear elastic solids , phonons are the basic mechanical excitations responsible for energy propagation . by contrast , </S>",
    "<S> an aggregate of macroscopic grains just in contact with their nearest neighbours constitute a novel elastic material where solitary waves or shocks replace phonons as the basic excitations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of these strongly non - linear waves can be traced to the fact that , unlike the case of harmonic springs , the repulsive force between two grains in contact does not depend linearly on the relative compression . </S>",
    "<S> so far , little effort has been directed to determine the fate of these strongly non - linear excitations in a background of thermal fluctuations because temperature is clearly not a parameter relevant to the elastic response of macroscopic grains .    however , granular aggregates at zero pressure are just one example of a broader class of materials that can be prepared in a unique mechanical state called _ sonic vacuum _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this term originally coined by nesterenko in the context of strongly non - linear granular chains designate a material characterized by a vanishing elastic moduli and linear speed of sound @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> grafted colloidal particles @xcite and ultra - cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite are microscopic systems that allow for tunable non - linear interactions , while being naturally coupled to a source of fluctuation ( thermal or quantum ) . </S>",
    "<S> these fluctuations restore rigidity and generate long wavelength phonon modes @xcite . however , the physics of very high amplitude strain propagation is still predominantly non - linear and resembles the state of sonic vacuum perturbed by background fluctuations , even if the interaction potentials are typically two sided , unlike granular ones . </S>",
    "<S> the non - linear regime is particularly relevant for some biological systems , where energy transport occurs through localized non - linear excitations with energy significantly higher than the thermal energy @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , systems such as polymer networks and colloidal glasses undergoing an unjamming transition are also characterized by vanishing elastic moduli as the coordination number or packing fraction are lowered towards the critical point @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of thermal fluctuations on the _ non - linear _ response of materials undergoing an unjamming transition is relatively unexplored , despite they are obvious examples of a sonic vacuum state at zero temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note , that in the case of jamming the linear elastic moduli can be lowered towards zero even if the microscopic interactions are harmonic , simply because there are not enough forces to prevent floppy motions .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we focus on strongly non - linear mechanical waves propagating in a background of small thermal fluctuations , a non - equilibrium problem that lies outside the realm of perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> the starting point of conventional perturbation methods is a linear elastic solid , possibly at finite temperature , perturbed by small anharmonic terms . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , we adopt as a starting point the fully non - linear state of sonic vacuum whose elementary excitations are long - lived solitary waves @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently we _ switch on _ temperature as a small perturbation that creates a background of thermal fluctuations .    as a minimal model that is analytically tractable , we study impulse propagation in a one dimensional lattice of non - linear springs with a tune - able power law interaction . by coupling the lattice to a heat bath </S>",
    "<S> , we then study the effects of the thermal fluctuations on the leading solitary wave generated in response to an impulse of energy much higher than the background thermal energy . </S>",
    "<S> our approach in a nutshell is to treat the solitary wave as a quasi - particle and derive an effective langevin equation that describes its stochastic dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we corroborate our analytical predictions for the damping rate and thermal diffusion of the solitary waves with langevin dynamic simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the sonic vacuum is usually studied with a chain of non - cohesive beads that only interact upon compression ( one - sided interaction ) . </S>",
    "<S> the system with springs has some of the same properties as the sonic vacuum , since the sonic vacuum is a property of the non - linear power law interaction ( without a harmonic term ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the compressive solitary waves seen in a lattice of macroscopic grains with one - sided repulsive interaction , we report an accompanying anti - solitary wave solution for the lattice of non - linear springs with two sided interactions .    ) </S>",
