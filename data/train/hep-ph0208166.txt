    "in the open quantum system approach@xcite , the evolution of a system interacting with an environment is described in an effective way , that is , the interaction with the environment is incorporated in the description of the evolution of the system . in general , the effects produced by the interaction cause dissipation and irreversibility .",
    "this treatment was originally developed for quantum optics@xcite , in order to take into account the system - reservoir ( environment ) interaction , and it has already been applied to elementary particle systems .",
    "recently , it has also been used in the study of two neutrino oscillations@xcite , modifying the well known oscillation probability , due to the presence of dissipative effects .",
    "one very interesting feature of the oscillation probability in this situation is that even in the case that neutrinos are massless , we can have neutrino flavor conversion@xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out that this mechanism is able to explain well , in the context of two generations , the atmospheric neutrino data collected by the super - kamiokande ( sk ) experiment@xcite , as long as the damping parameter is @xmath2 , @xmath3 being the neutrino energy .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to extend this formalism of mass , mixing and quantum decoherence to three generations .",
    "this is rather well motivated since nowadays the atmospheric and solar neutrino observations@xcite can only be explained by the introduction of some neutrino flavor conversion mechanism which must be understood , specially after the recent impressive sno results@xcite , in terms of three generations .",
    "therefore , this extension will be very useful , because it will permit us to study the decoherence contributions on top of the oscillation induced by mass ( oim ) in a complete three neutrino context .",
    "we have developed this three neutrino formalism using the powerful technique of quantum dynamical semigroups@xcite , which makes our analysis independent of any hypothesis about the interaction between the neutrino system and the environment .",
    "quantum open systems can also be treated using the master equation formalism@xcite , but in this case , a previous knowledge about the interaction with the environment is required .",
    "this is an important point since it is not clearly established which is the origin of the pervasive medium , the most likely possibilities at the moment are quantum gravity effects described by strings at low energy range . in this way ,",
    "our results are broader from the phenomenological point of view .",
    "based on motivations coming from the master equation formalism using the weak coupling limit in two generations@xcite , we have casted the most relevant decoherence effects in a diagonal dissipation matrix , as a result we have obtained manageable probability expressions .    additionally , as a phenomenological application of this three neutrino extension for the decoherence phenomena , we have performed a qualitative study to inspect the agreement between the average behaviour of relevant neutrino data and the decoherence solution to the atmospheric neutrino anomaly in two generations , embodied within this enlarged neutrino framework .",
    "we have done this study assuming different alternatives for the introduction of the two generations decoherence solution in our three neutrino scheme .",
    "basically we have divided the study in two parts . on the first part we use only pd to fully describe three neutrino flavor conversions , and on the second we deal with a hybrid case , where we assume decoherence plus oim take place in the @xmath4 sector .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : qdn ] we describe the quantum dynamical semigroup formalism for a three level quantum system . in sec .",
    "[ sec : neutrinos ] we apply this formalism for the neutrino system , explicitly calculating the survival and conversion probabilities among neutrino flavors under the influence of decoherence effects . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pheno ] we analyze the consistence of the decoherence solution to the atmospheric neutrino problem in the three generation framework . finally in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] we present our conclusions .",
    "hamiltonian evolution , that is , the time evolution of a physical system described by the schrdinger equation in the case of pure ensembles , or by the liouville equation for mixed ones , is a characteristic of systems isolated from their surroundings .",
    "the time evolution of an isolated quantum system with hamiltonian @xmath5 is given by the continuous group of unitary transformations @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the time . from the mathematical point of view , the existence of the inverse of the infinitesimal generator @xmath5 , a consequence of the algebraic structure of a group , gives rise to _ reversible processes _ in hamiltonian systems .",
    "we know that the time evolution of a quantum open system is characterized by the presence of dissipative effects which , in turn , give rise to the _ irreversible nature _ of the evolution .",
    "so , if a given family of transformations should be responsible for the evolution in time of a quantum open system , this family will certainly not be a group . a rigorous mathematical treatment of quantum open systems is provided by the so called quantum dynamical semigroups@xcite .",
    "the evolution generated by the operators in these semigroups has the property of being forward in time , as a consequence of the lack of inverse in a semigroup .",
    "physically , this property can be interpreted as the existence of an arrow of time which in turn makes possible the connection with thermodynamics via an entropy .    according to ref.@xcite ,",
    "if @xmath8 is the hilbert space of a given open quantum system , and @xmath9 the space of bounded operators acting on @xmath8 , the infinitesimal generator @xmath10 , defined through its action on the density matrix @xmath11 , is given by @xmath12 + \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{j}\\left([a_{j},\\rho(t ) a_{j}^{\\dagger } ] + [ a_{j}\\rho(t ) , a_{j}^{\\dagger } ] \\right ) , \\label{gen}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the `` effective '' hamiltonian of the system , @xmath5 being its free hamiltonian and @xmath14 accounts for possible additional dissipative contributions which can be incorporated to @xmath5 , in other words , which can be put in the hamiltonian form .",
    "@xmath15 is a sequence of bounded operators of @xmath8 ( @xmath16 ) satisfying @xmath17 . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ gen ] ) constitutes the hamiltonian part of the evolution , whereas the second term is responsible for the irreversible ( non - hamiltonian ) nature of an open system evolving in time .",
    "therefore , if we interpret the last expression as an effective equation describing the reduced dynamics of an open system interacting with a certain `` environment '' , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ gen ] ) , in a certain sense , represents the interaction between the open system and the mentioned environment .",
    "however , the generator @xmath18 does not depend on a particular interaction , being constructed based on very general hypothesis about the time evolution , that is , irreversible dynamics , conservation of probability and a less intuitive hypothesis known as complete positivity@xcite .    for a n - level system",

    "( [ expansion ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ gen ] ) we get finally @xmath39    the system of first order differential equations above describes the time evolution of a three - level quantum open system .",
    "such an evolution is governed by the laws of quantum dynamical semigroups .",
    "the physical processes exhibit an arrow of time as a consequence of the monotonical increase of the von neumman entropy as a function of time .",
    "the evolution also allows the interpretation of the eigenvalues of @xmath11 at any instant of time as the probability of finding the open system in the eigenstate associated with the eigenvalue .",
    "as already mentioned , the theoretical approach provided by quantum dynamical semigroups is a very general one to treat open quantum systems in the sense that no explicit hypothesis has to be made about the possible interactions causing the loss of quantum coherence . on the other hand",
    ", there is another approach to deal with systems of the same nature , in which a well defined form of the interaction ought to be provided in order to derive the reduced dynamics of the open quantum system .",
    "this approach is known as the master equation formalism and its rigorous mathematical formulation can be found in a series of papers  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to show that the master equation formalism applied to an open system weakly coupled to some environment leads to an evolution equation for the reduced density matrix of the open system compatible of that obtained from eq .",
    "( [ gen ] ) @xcite , in other words , in this situation , the master equation and the quantum dynamical semigroup formalism are equivalent .    coming back to eq .",
    "( [ differential ] ) , we see that the differential equation for the @xmath40 component and conservation of probability imply @xmath41 .",

    "the solution is too complicated to allow for direct physical interpretations .",
    "in this section we present an expression for the probability of neutrino flavor conversion assuming that the dynamics responsible by this process is constituted by the already known standard oim mechanism , as well as by dissipative effects according to quantum dynamical semigroups .",

    "motivations coming from the formalism of master equation , in the so called weak coupling limit , applied to the problem of neutrino flavor conversion in the two generation case@xcite , lead us to assume a diagonal matrix @xmath38 , that is , @xmath64 = diag(0,-\\gamma_{1},-\\gamma_{2},-\\gamma_{3},-\\gamma_{4},-\\gamma_{5},-\\gamma_{6},-\\gamma_{7},-\\gamma_{8 } ) , \\label{ansatz}\\ ] ] where the diagonal elements are given by @xmath65    in the case of two generations , the diagonal form of @xmath38 can be deduced via the master equation formalism in the weak coupling limit , provided that a gas of quanta , satisfying infinite statistics ( for example a d0-brane ) is adopted as the dissipative medium .",

    "these results were expected , since the same was obtained in two generations  @xcite .    the atmospheric neutrino data can be interpreted well using the pd phenomena in the two generation framework  @xcite .",

    "can clearly demonstrate that this is not so .",
    "the explanation goes as follows .",
    "since we aim to test the decoherence solution to the atmospheric neutrino data in the three generations scheme , we will have to consider the damping parameters with the dependence @xmath81 , in accordance with the two generations assumption .",

    "the conjunction of all of these properties of the probabilities with the fact that @xmath84 , makes the three neutrino pd mechanism incompatible with the actual neutrino data .",
    "one can exemplify this inconsistency by confronting the results of the neutrino experiments chooz  @xcite and k2k  @xcite with our theoretical predictions .",

    ", we will make some further assumptions .",
    "first , we will take @xmath155 and @xmath156 , both consistent with the lma solution to the solar neutrino problem  @xcite , second we will neglect all the decoherence parameters for the @xmath82 at the range of the atmospheric neutrino scale , with the exception of @xmath157 , which is needed in order to make @xmath86 similar to its form in the decoherence solution to the atmospheric neutrino anomaly in two generations .",
    "once we have accepted these assumptions , we can study the compatibility of these probabilities with the current data .",
    "we will not use the atmospheric neutrino data to test the viability of the decoherence solution in the three generations scheme .",
    "this is because the probabilities are written as a function of @xmath158 and @xmath159 , which makes it difficult to extract correct conclusions without introducing refinements to the qualitative analysis we have used up to now .",
    "instead , we will simply look at chooz data .",
    "this will be enough to give us a good idea about the compatibility of the decoherence solution in the three neutrino scheme , through the observations in the channel @xmath160 .",
    "since we are going to use for this study @xmath161 , it is convenient to write it down after the assumptions mentioned above are taken into account @xmath162    we have obtained excluded regions in the plane ( @xmath163 ) , with @xmath164 , following the statistical procedure described in ref .",
    "we must point out that variations in @xmath165 will not affect these excluded regions , since @xmath166 in the chooz range .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the points to the right of the contours are excluded .",

    "under the assumption that the neutrino system can interact with a pervasive environment , we have obtained neutrino probability formulae for three neutrino generations , taking into account quantum dissipative effects coming from the interaction with the medium on top of the oim mechanism .",
    "the damping terms were brought in through the quantum dynamical semigroup formalism .",
    "this approach is very useful , since no _ a priori _ assumption on the form of neutrino - medium interaction has to be made .",
    "some simplifications of the form of the dissipative matrix were adopted based on results in two generations .    we have performed a qualitative analysis to test if the two generation decoherence solution to the atmospheric neutrino problem viewed in this hybrid three neutrino framework , can still explain the tendencies of the current experimental neutrino data .",
    "we have analyzed two different cases , the first one considering only pd and the second including a mixture of both conversion mechanisms , that is , decoherence plus oim .",
    "the second case was further subdivided into two cases , according to the choice of mixing matrix : i ) mass and mixing contributions connecting @xmath176 ; ii ) mass and mixing contribution connecting @xmath177 .",
    "we have observed that all of these cases are clearly disfavored by recent relevant experimental neutrino data .",
    "particularly , in the pd case , the fact that @xmath178 is not compatible with the constraint given by chooz combined with sk data ( @xmath97 and @xmath179 ) or with k2k results . for the hybrid case of decoherence plus non - null mixing in @xmath176 , the same prediction",
    "@xmath178 arises which is clearly not supported by sk data . in the case of decoherence plus mixing in @xmath177 , we have made a statistical analysis of chooz data using our theoretical expression for @xmath161 , with some simplifications .",
    "we have obtained that the best fit value for the decoherence solution to the atmospheric neutrino problem , @xmath180 gev@xmath174 , is highly disfavored by data .",
    "values of @xmath181 gev@xmath174 for @xmath158 consistent with the lma solution to the solar neutrino deficit are , in general , excluded at 99 % c.l ..    although , the tests we have performed in the three neutrino scheme indicate a disagreement between data and theoretical expectations , this does not mean that dissipative effects can not exist as subleading processes , with the full three neutrino oim as the main mechanism for neutrino flavor conversion .",
    "in fact , the formulae developed here are interesting to be used to help establishing limits on the decoherence parameters or to try to detect their effects using an appropriate three neutrino description .",
    "also it is worth to stress that we have worked here in a simplified situation in which the dissipative matrix is diagonal .",
    "the presence of off - diagonal terms can certainly produce interesting effects on the probability expressions .",
    "our formulae can be easily modified to include these off - diagonal terms .",
