    "ir singularities manifest themselves as poles in @xmath7 .",
    "the renormalization conditions imply that the higher @xmath1 poles are determined by the single - pole coefficient , from which one obtains the anomalous dimension .",
    "in contrast to traditional effective theories , scet operators are nonlocal along the direction of large momentum flow .",

    "scet contains a separate set of collinear fields for each direction of large energy flow , and a single set of soft fields mediating interactions among the different collinear sectors . up to contributions suppressed by powers of the large momentum transfers ,",

    "the matrix elements of @xmath0-parton operators factor into jet functions associated with each set of collinear fields and a soft function which arises from interactions among the different jets . since different collinear fields do not interact , the jet functions are color diagonal . non - trivial momentum dependence and color correlations of the anomalous dimension arise from soft interactions .",
    "the fact that the soft and jet functions must conspire to produce an anomalous dimension depending only on hard momentum transfers leads to strong constraints on the form of the allowed terms .",

    "we argue that to all orders in perturbation theory the anomalous dimension has the same structure as at one - loop order , featuring only two - particle correlations in colors and momenta .",
    "our result is semi - classical in that it describes color - dipole interactions , which probe the momenta and color charges of pairs of external particles .",
    "this is reminiscent of low s theorem , which relates the cross section for soft photon emission to the classical cross section times a factor depending on the electric charges and momenta of the external particles @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the quantum structure of the underlying field theory shows itself via the coefficient of the color - dipole operator , which we relate to the universal cusp anomalous dimension of light - like wilson loops , and via anomalous dimensions for quark and gluon fields . in practice , these anomalous dimensions can be determined at three - loop order using existing results for the quark and gluon form factors in qcd .",
    "however , our analysis is completely general and extends to arbitrary gauge theories with massless fields .",
    "starting at three - loop order , the analysis of the structure of the anomalous dimension becomes non - trivial .",
    "based on a general study of the constraints following from soft - collinear factorization and the non - abelian exponentiation theorem , we show that in the most general case two additional color structures beyond those predicted by our simple formula could appear at three - loop order .",
    "one of them describes interactions among four different partons .",
    "we also show that at four - loop order a new structure could arise , which would violate casimir scaling of the cusp anomalous dimension .",

    "it is a necessary ingredient for the resummation of large logarithms in jet - production processes . solving rg equations in scet resums perturbative logarithms of ratios of the invariant masses of the produced jets to the large momentum transfers involved in their production . as an application of our results",

    "we first list all structures allowed by non - abelian exponentiation and then impose the constraints from soft - collinear factorization and from two - particle collinear limits .",
    "these constraints eliminate all additional terms with the exception of a single color structure , which is of subleading order in the @xmath11 limit and compatible with the constraints if it is multiplied by a function of conformal ratios which vanishes in all collinear limits .",

    "it would certainly be worthwhile to test the rigor of these arguments with explicit multi - loop calculations , as we have emphasized toward the end of section  [ sec : simplifications ] .",
    "nevertheless , in our opinion these arguments provide compelling evidence that our result is correct to all ( finite ) orders in perturbation theory .",
    "essentially , the constraint ( [ ourconstraint ] ) derived from the factorization properties of scet , when combined with the splitting relation ( [ gsplit ] ) , requires that the anomalous - dimension matrix must be _ linear _ in both the cusp angles and the color generators of the external partons , and that the coefficient of the cusp term is the cusp anomalous dimension .",
    "this implies that momentum - independent terms are color - diagonal to all orders .",
    "momentum - dependent structures must have the color - dipole structure exhibited in ( [ magic ] ) .",
    "it thus appears that our relation ( [ magic ] ) may indeed be an exact result of perturbative quantum field theory , valid in arbitrary massless gauge theories .",
    "there are few such results known in the literature , and it is not unreasonable to expect that the discovery of this relation will have profound implications for our understanding of scattering amplitudes .",
    "we have shown that the ir poles of on - shell scattering amplitudes in massless qcd can be mapped onto the uv poles of the renormalization factor @xmath5 of @xmath0-jet operators in scet .",
    "the rg evolution of these operators is governed by a universal anomalous - dimension matrix , whose form is severely constrained by soft - collinear factorization , non - abelian exponentiation , and the behavior of amplitudes in collinear limits .",
    "we have argued that only the simple form @xmath400 is consistent with all these constraints and have explicitly checked that they exclude any additional contributions up to three - loop accuracy .",
    "we also find that contributions from terms involving higher casimir operators are excluded at four loops .",
    "however , our arguments do not exclude the presence of the term @xmath401 at three - loop order ( and analogous terms in higher orders ) , where the function @xmath310 would have to vanish whenever two parton momenta become collinear , and the conformal cross ratios @xmath244 are defined in ( [ ccr ] ) .",
    "we consider it unlikely that such functions arise in the anomalous - dimension matrix and thus conjecture that they are absent .",
    "since the discussion in our paper relies solely on the commutation relations and the jacobi identity , our results apply to any massless gauge theory based on a semi - simple group .",
    "furthermore , by combining our results with methods developed in @xcite , which relate the singularities of massive and massless amplitudes , our formalism can be generalized to the massive case .",
    "this is worked out in detail in @xcite .",
    "the above form of the anomalous dimension is consistent with all existing results for higher - order scattering amplitudes , but it would be desirable to further test it with explicit multi - loop calculations",
    ". it will be particularly interesting to compare with the three - loop result for the full four - parton amplitude in @xmath9 sym given in @xcite , once the necessary master integrals become available .",
    "in particular , this result will check whether color correlations between four partons appear , and whether they obey the constraints from soft - collinear factorization and collinear limits , i.e.  whether they have the form discussed above . also of great interest would be a calculation of the four - loop cusp anomalous dimensions of quarks and gluons in qcd or its supersymmetric extensions , either by direct calculation , extending the work of @xcite , or by using the approach based on the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "this would test our prediction of casimir scaling .",
    "the recent accomplishment of the exact evaluation of three - loop form factor integrals @xcite gives us hope that these calculations will become feasible in the not too distant future .",
    "understanding the ir structure of scattering amplitudes is of significant theoretical interest , and having explicit results for the divergent part of the amplitudes provides an important check on multi - loop calculations .",
    "also , since the singularities must cancel against those of diagrams with real gluon emission , our results might lead to an improved treatment of the soft and collinear singularities in real emission processes .",
    "however , the most important application of our work are resummations of sudakov logarithms in multi - jet processes .",

    "the effective - theory approach allows one to not only combine fixed - order with leading - log resummations , but also to systematically resum subleading sudakov logarithms . to obtain predictions for @xmath0-jet observables",
    ", one needs the fixed - order results for @xmath0-parton amplitudes , which correspond to the wilson coefficients of the operators in scet . by combining our results with a tree - level matrix element generator",

    ", the virtual corrections are known to two - loop accuracy , so that in this case n@xmath402ll accuracy can be achieved .",
    "the predictions for production rates of @xmath0-jet processes are obtained by combining the resummed hard - scattering wilson coefficients with jet and soft functions .",
    "in contrast to fixed - order calculations or parton showers , these predictions are inclusive in the sense that they predict jet observables , and not the contributions of individual partons : the jet functions already include the integration over the phase space of the partons within a jet .    for the analysis of this paper the concepts of effective field theory , such as mode separation and rg methods , were helpful to address an old problem of perturbative quantum field theory , which had resisted a solution using traditional methods .",

    "<S> , we demonstrate that these constraints imply that to three - loop order the anomalous dimension involves only two - parton correlations , with the possible exception of a single color structure multiplying a function of conformal cross ratios depending on the momenta of four external partons , which would have to vanish in all two - particle collinear limits . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that such a function does not appear at three - loop order , and that the same is true in higher orders . </S>",
    "<S> our formula predicts casimir scaling of the cusp anomalous dimension to all orders in perturbation theory , and we explicitly check that the constraints exclude the appearance of higher casimir invariants at four loops . using known results for the quark and gluon form factors , </S>",
