    "human communication patterns on the internet are characterized by transient responses to social events .",
    "examples of such phenomena are the discussion threads generated in news aggregators , the propagation of massively circulated internet chain letters , or the synthesis of articles in collaborative web - based spaces such as wikipedia .",
    "these responses can be regarded as tree - like cascades of activity generated from an underlying social network .",
    "typically , a trigger event , or a small set of initiators , generate a chain reaction which may catch the attention of other users who end up participating in the cascade ( see figure [ fig : real ] for examples ) and attract even more users . since these cascades of comments are a direct consequence of the information flow in a social system , understanding the mechanisms and patterns which govern them plays a fundamental role in contexts like spreading of technological innovations @xcite , diffusion of news and opinion @xcite , social influence @xcite or collective problem - solving @xcite .",
    "although information cascades have been extensively analyzed for particular domains , such as blogs @xcite , chain letters @xcite , flickr @xcite , twitter @xcite or page diffusion on facebook @xcite , the cascades under consideration in those studies rarely involve elaborated discussions or complex interchange of opinions : generally , a small piece of information is just forwarded from an individual to its direct neighbors . to the best of our knowledge , with the exception of @xcite , no previous work exists on modeling the evolution and structure of long discussion - based cascades .    here , as in @xcite , we consider several websites where the associated ( discussion ) cascades contain high level of interaction .",
    "we analyze for the first time the cascades of the popular news aggregator _ slashdot _ , _ barrapunto _ ( a spanish version of slashdot ) and _ meneame _ ( a spanish _ digg_-clone ) and the english _ wikipedia_. as the reader may notice , these datasets are quite heterogeneous .",
    "for instance , although posts from both slashdot and meneame correspond to popular news which rely on broadcasted events , slashdot contains rich and very extensive comments , which are less frequent in meneame .",
    "the cascades found in wikipedia , on the other hand , represent collaborative effort towards a well defined goal : produce a free , reliable article .    in this study",
    "we address the following questions : what are the statistical patterns that determine the structure of such cascades and their evolution ? can these patterns be largely determined regardless of semantic information using a simple parametric model ? can the parameterization corresponding to a given website provide a global characterization for it ?",
    "we first provide a global analysis of the cascade behavior in the four mentioned websites . among other results , we find that typically , the sizes of the cascades have a clear defined scale , which seems to contradict the recent results of @xcite .",
    "our analysis also highlights the importance of repetitive user participation in relation to other types of cascades and their impact on the entire social network .",
    "we also present a growth model for discussion cascades which is validated in the four datasets .",
    "our approach is based on a simple model of preferential attachment ( pa ) @xcite , where new contributions in the cascade tree are linked to existing contributions with a probability which depends on their popularity ( degree ) .",
    "two key ingredients characterize our approach : first , we account for a certain bias favoring the root , or event initiator . in this way , we are able to capture the different processes governing the global ( direct reactions ) and the localized responses of the system .",
    "second , we use a likelihood method particularly developed for this study which allows an efficient estimation of the model parameters which considers the _ entire _ generative model .",
    "the method is applicable not only for the data considered here but for a more general class of growing graphs .",
    "here we are only interested on the stochastic process which generates the cascade .",
    "we do not model network dynamics or a termination criteria for the cascades .",
    "such a model could be built on top of our current model as it is done for example in @xcite .    in the next section ,",
    "we explain the proposed model and how we estimate its parameters .",
    "section [ sec : datasets ] introduces the datasets and provides a global analysis about their main characteristics . in section  [ sec : results ] we explain the main results and give an interpretation of the parameters of the model . finally , in section",
    "[ sec : related ] we describe related work and discuss the results in section  [ sec : discussion ] . in the appendix",
    "we explain some aspects of the likelihood approach which are important for the estimation of parameters .",
    "we model a discussion cascade as a growing network in which nodes correspond to comments and the initial node corresponds to the post ( a news article , for instance ) .",
    "a new node is added sequentially at discrete time - steps .",
    "our model is based on the original pa model to which we add a bias to the first node . since each new",
    "node adds only one new link to the existing graph , the resulting network is a tree .",
    "we also assume that the total number of nodes @xmath0 is known .",
    "it is convenient to represent compactly the cascade as a vector of parent nodes @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes the parent of the node @xmath3 added at time - step @xmath4 .",
    "we are interested in the probability of being node @xmath5 the parent @xmath6 given the past history @xmath7 , that is @xmath8 , for @xmath9 , @xmath10 and initial vector @xmath11 .",
    "we have @xmath12 and for all trees , @xmath13 and @xmath14 otherwise , i.e. @xmath11 always . ]",
    "note that by construction , @xmath15 .    at time - step @xmath4",
    ", we relate the _ popularity _ of a node @xmath5 with its number of links ( degree @xmath16 ) before node @xmath3 is added in the following way : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the kronecker delta function . in the following ,",
    "we omit the explicit dependence on @xmath7 , so that @xmath19 .    , node number @xmath20 is added to the cascade . with probability proportional to @xmath21",
    "it is added to the root node ( initiator ) and with probability proportional to @xmath22 to one of the non - root nodes .",
    "bottom right shows the corresponding parent vector @xmath1 ( see text for definitions ) . ]",
    "the pa model attaches new nodes to node @xmath5 with probability proportional to its popularity",
    ". see figure [ fig : model ] for an illustration . for completeness",
    ", we consider two models : a simple pa model _ without bias _ to the root and a model which differentiates between the root node and the rest .    in the general pa model , the probability for attaching the node @xmath3 to node @xmath5 at time - step @xmath9 is parameterized using a linear term @xmath23 and an exponent @xmath24 for each of the nodes :    @xmath25    * model without bias * : if we set @xmath26 and @xmath27 , for @xmath10 , we recover an important generalization of barabasi s pa model , where the probability of attachment to a node goes as some general power @xmath28 of the degree @xcite . for @xmath29 , the linear preferential attachment is recovered . in this case , nodes have power - law distributed degrees . for @xmath30 , or sublinear pa , the degrees are distributed according to a stretched exponential . for @xmath31 there is a `` condensation '' phenomenon , in which a single node gets a finite fraction of all the connections in the network @xcite .    * model with bias * : consider the following parameterization : @xmath32 in this case , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the exponents of the pa processes governing the root and the non - root nodes respectively .",
    "@xmath35 can be regarded as an additional degree of freedom weighting the root of the tree . in section [ sec : params ] we discuss about the interpretability of these parameters .",
    "note that , although we explicitly model the event which triggers the cascade as a root node , this representation does not limit the cascade to be originated from an individual event only .",
    "the root node can of course represent a group of initiators .",
    "usually , pa in evolving networks is measured by calculating the rate at which groups of nodes with identical connectivity form new links during a small time interval @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "however , this approach is suitable only for networks with many nodes that are stationary in the sense that the number of nodes remain constant during the interval @xmath36 .",
    "this is not a reasonable assumption in our data , which is often produced by a transient , highly nonstationary , response .",
    "another approach for parameter estimation relies on fitting a measured property , for instance the degree distribution , for which an analytical form can be derived in the model under consideration . for the pa model ,",
    "extensive results exist with emphasis precisely on the degree distributions @xcite . however , two important aspects are worth to mention here .",
    "first , analytical results usually rely on assumptions like a continuum limit or on an infinite size network , which is also not the case of our data .",
    "second , it is important to stress here that when parameters are learned for a particular observable for which an analytical form has been derived , the model may _ overfit _ on this measure , introducing a bias in other structural properties such as subtree sizes , average depths , or other correlations .",
    "our approach considers the likelihood function corresponding to the _ entire _ generative process ( instead of particular measures such as degree distributions or subtree sizes ) introduced before .",
    "we can assign to each observation ( each node arrival in each cascade ) a given probability using equation .",
    "the parameters for which the likelihood is maximal are the ones that best explain the data given the model assumptions ( see @xcite for a similar approach for another network growth model ) .",
    "formally , we observe a set @xmath37 of @xmath0 trees with respective sizes @xmath38 , @xmath39 and we want to find the values of @xmath40 which best explain the data",
    ". the likelihood function can be written as : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the vector of parents in the tree @xmath43 after time @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the parent of node @xmath3 in the tree @xmath43 , and @xmath46 denotes the degree of node @xmath47 as in equation in the tree @xmath43 . instead of maximizing directly , it is more convenient to minimize the negative of the log - likelihood function : @xmath48 where @xmath49 .    for more details about the optimization see the appendix .    [ cols=\"^,>,<,>,<,>,<,^,>,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tb : params ]    a clear segregation between the group of three news media websites and the wikipedia is manifested on figure  [ fig : params ] in the value of @xmath34 .",
    "slashdot , has the highest value , @xmath50 , even higher than @xmath33 for barrapunto .",
    "it is also very similar to @xmath33 for the same dataset .",
    "this similarity may capture the special quality of the slashdot comments . in a sense",
    ", good comments may behave like posts and may act eventually as effective initiator of information diffusion cascades .",
    "the smaller value of @xmath51 found for meneame indicates that the diffusion of the news comments in this website is closer to a random process .",
    "this can be again influenced by the lack of explicit information about the popularity of a given comment .",
    "the same is true for barrapunto although its value of @xmath52 is slightly negative , indicating a slight _ inverse _ pa process .",
    "however , such an _ inverse _ pa process is much more prominent in the case of wikipedia : whereas its @xmath33 is high , indicating a strong pa in the root process in agreement with the other datasets , its @xmath34 is negative and has the largest absolute value of all four datasets .",
    "what are the implications of this result ?",
    "once a comment on a wikipedia article has been originated , it will derive in a collaborative reciprocal chain between a very reduced group of contributors .",
    "so once a node has received a reply it will be three ( exactly : @xmath53 ) times less likely to receive another one than the replying new comment itself . in other words , nodes with degree equal to one ( leaf nodes ) are much more likely to be linked with a new node than nodes which higher degrees .    finally , the parameter @xmath35 acts as a weight which expresses the trend towards the root of the cascade in relation to the subsequent nodes .",
    "it is especially important in the beginning of the cascade , when the degree of the root node is low , and determines whether initially many nodes attach to the root or rather to one of the first comments .",
    "we observe thus that meneame shows the largest initial predominance of direct reactions , while wikipedia gives higher probability mass to the comments , allowing thus large chains already with a small number of nodes .",
    "the values for slashdot and barrapunto lie in between indicating an intermediate initial preference for the root node , showing barrapunto a higher probability for early reply - chains than slashdot .    what would be the scenario if one tries to explain the cascades using the simple model without bias to the root",
    "? we also fit the simple pa model to the data . in that case",
    ", we would infer mistakenly that both meneame and wikipedia systems are in the `` condensation '' regime  @xcite , since their exponents ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively ) are larger than one .",
    "the next question we want to answer is how stable are these parameters within the same site , i.e. if we split for example different discussions according to their category , do we obtain similar parameters ?",
    "we investigate this question for the topic categories in slashdot ( we only consider categories with more than 100 discussions ) and find ( see figure  [ fig : sdparams ] ) that the majority of topics has a set of parameters which is close to the one obtained for the entire website .",
    "this is remarkable given the heterogeneous picture that is observed if the depths and widths of the discussions are considered  @xcite .",
    "so it seems that , although the amount of comments which attracts the different categories may be different , the actual structure of the discussions follows a very similar pattern .",
    "however , if we consider the @xmath28 parameters , we observe three outliers from the main cluster .",
    "the topics `` books '' and `` ask '' have much larger values , indicating a more experienced preferential attachment behavior , while the topic `` games '' , on the other hand , has the largest difference between @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "it seems that in this topic category direct comments to the root node are more frequent while in the two other outliers also comments seem to be able to attract a reasonable amount of replies .",
    "it is also interesting to observe the differences in the values of @xmath35 , where we find the largest trend toward the root for `` hardware '' and the smallest for `` books '' articles .",
    "summarizing , the optimal parameters permit an interpretation of the communication habits of each social space and are relatively stable across different categories within a site .",
    "this representation also leads to different classification as a function of the parameters .",
    "the bias to the root node is crucial to separate slashdot and barrapunto from wikipedia and meneame according to @xmath33 , and wikipedia from the three news aggregators according to @xmath34 .",
    "due to the increasing availability of empirical data on cascades , extensive work is appearing with focus on how information cascades are propagated in a social network . at a statistical description level , information cascades have been analyzed in detail for particular social spaces .",
    "twitter cascades @xcite are predominantly shallow and wide ( maximum depth is 11 ) .",
    "flickr @xcite shows the remarkable phenomenon that popular photos spread slowly and not widely .",
    "this is in harmony with our findings which report that even the largest realizations reach a very small proportion of the social network .",
    "blog cascades have been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "interestingly , although one would expect blog cascades to share more similarities with the discussion cascades existing in slashdot or meneame , it is the wikipedia dataset which shows most similar patterns to the blog cascades ( see figure [ fig : sizes ] ) . in @xcite , a model of both blogger ( user ) and",
    "cascades was presented which reproduces global temporal and structural aspects of the blogosphere .",
    "we note that the motivation of our work is rather different . whereas @xcite aims for finding the simplest , parameter - free model able to describe both user network and cascade behavior , we look for a parameterized model from which we can describe communication habits which characterize a particular website ( see section [ sec : params ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the blog data , the datasets considered here contain complete information of the cascade evolution . in this sense ,",
    "our data avoids selection bias which strongly influences the estimation of these processes @xcite . in @xcite , a simple branching process ( galton - watson process )",
    "is proposed for modeling chain - letter cascades .",
    "although such a model may explain certain characteristics such as depths distributions ( after proper correction for selection bias ) it can not capture the cascade evolution and assumes that all degree distributions are independent , so its utility for our purposes remains very limited .    during the development of this manuscript we learned of the work of kumar et al .",
    "@xcite which also presents a model for discussion trees , called t - model .",
    "the same study also considers other aspects of the cascades such as the identities of each member of the conversation .",
    "our work is focused on the cascade model , its parameter estimation and validation on the four datasets . the same or a different authorship model as the one of  @xcite",
    "could also be built on top of the model proposed here .",
    "the t - model is based on _ linear _ preferential attachment only , and unlike ours does not distinguish between root and subsequent nodes .",
    "however , it includes a _",
    "term which allows it to capture qualitatively the relation between the sizes and the depths of the cascades .",
    "preliminary experiments indicate similar ability of our model in this aspect .",
    "additionally , the bias to the root considered here clearly permits to capture other quantities with higher accuracy , such as the degree distributions or the subtree sizes .",
    "this suggests that at least for the datasets analyzed here our model performs better . the maximum likelihood estimation scheme presented here finds the best parameters of a model given the data , and therefore allows to quantify objectively the predictive power of different models .",
    "such a comparison between the two cascade models and possible hybrid forms is left for future research .",
    "a further difference between the t - model and our study is that it also includes a parameter for the termination of the discussion .",
    "the resulting termination probability of a discussion is independent of its actual structure and could be substituted by any other model encoding the popularity of discussions ( e.g.  @xcite ) , which could also be combined with our model .",
    "we have presented a thoughtful analysis and comparison of the structure and evolution of the different discussion cascades of three popular news media websites and the english wikipedia .",
    "our analysis highlights the heterogeneities between the discussion cascades , which can be conditioned from two factors , namely , the page design , or platform , and the audience . despite this , we have given evidence that a simple model can capture most of the structural properties and the evolution profiles of the real cascades with the particularities of each dataset .",
    "further , we have derived a rigorous maximum likelihood approach which considers the entire evolution of the cascade .",
    "the learned parameters of the model proposed here allow for a figurative description that characterizes the communication habits of a website .    for some datasets",
    ", the model tends to produce too shallow cascades .",
    "we postulate that this occurs especially in mature discussions , where interaction at the leaves only happens between a few individuals who start to reply mutually to each other and increase the mean cascade depth considerably . a possible extension which could correct for that effect is focus of current research .",
    "we wish to thank david laniado and riccardo tasso for providing the preprocessed wikipedia dataset and meneame.net for allowing to access an anonymised dump of their database .",
    "we also thank mohammad gheshlaghi and alberto llera for useful discussions .",
    "in this appendix we describe some considerations related to the log likelihood function we want to minimize .",
    "briefly , we show that the pa model can be formulated as a probability distribution which belongs to the exponential family . consequently , the optimization problem is convex , e.g. has the convenient property that any local minimum is global .    without loss of generality",
    "we can assume that parameter @xmath23 is of the following form : @xmath56 we can rewrite the pa model defined in equation as : @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "this probability distribution is equivalent to that of the equation , but expressed in terms of the exponential family .",
    "the log - likelihood function can be rewritten as : @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "the hessian of this function ( matrix of second order partial derivatives ) is always positive semi - definite .",
    "the presented method can therefore be applied to any set of observations which can be expressed as a collection of parent vectors @xmath61 from which the degrees of each node at each time - step can be obtained . once the minimization is performed",
    ", we can recover the original parameter @xmath23 with @xmath62 the basic pa model is the special case where @xmath63 .",
    "note that the bias to the root node can be introduced :          as expected , since model * ( c ) * uses more parameters than * ( a ) * and * ( b ) * , the resulting likelihoods and fits are better . in particular , the impact of adding @xmath35 as a parameter is notable in the approximated measures related to the root node , for instance the root degree distributions .",
    "notice that the convexity does not imply uniqueness of optimal parameter values .",
    "it could happen that the same minimum is attained for a large range of parameter values .",
    "we used as an optimization procedure the nelder - mead simplex algorithm ( implemented as fminsearch in matlab ) which is an unconstrained non - linear direct search method that does not use numerical or analytic gradients .",
    "starting from many different random initial conditions , we did not find multiple optimal values in any of the datasets , so we can conclude that the presented values for each dataset are unique ."
