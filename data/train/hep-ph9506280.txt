    "nucleon scattering structure functions , which indicate that the angular momentum of the proton is not distributed among its parton constituents in the way expected in the nave quark models .",
    "this discussion has been facilitated by the relatively well  understood theoretical framework of perturbative qcd , the operator product expansion and local operator matrix elements .",
    "other puzzling polarization measurements , such as those of helicity  amplitude effects in @xmath15 elastic scattering or of @xmath0 polarization in hadron ",

    "some modelling of nonperturbative qcd is essential for the interpretation of these experiments , as well as for understanding the local operator matrix elements determined by deep",
    " inelastic structure  function measurements .",
    "0.3 cm    broadly speaking , one can distinguish two principal trends in the interpretation of these deep  inelastic measurements .",
    "one notes that the measured values of axial current matrix elements @xmath16 , in particular the smallness of the singlet axial current matrix element @xmath17 , are closer to the values expected in chiral soliton models in the twin limits of massless quarks and a large number of colours @xmath18 , and interprets the data in terms of the topology of the flavour @xmath19 group as reflected in such chiral soliton models @xcite .",
    "the other trend assigns responsibility for the smallness of @xmath20 to the @xmath21 axial  current anomaly , which may a play either perturbatively , via a gluonic correction to the polarized quark ",
    "parton distributions in the proton wave function : @xmath22 , or nonperturbatively via a dynamical suppression of the @xmath21 topological susceptibility @xcite .",
    "0.3 cm    the perturbative approach to suppression of the axial @xmath21 matrix element invokes a large polarized gluon distribution @xmath23 which is absent from the chiral soliton approach .",
    "these models are , therefore , easy to distinguish in principle , and various proposals have been made for measuring the gluon polarization via hard processes in deep ",
    "inelastic scattering and elsewhere .",
    "some experimental information is starting to become available , but no test discriminating clearly between these models has yet been made . at our present level of understanding , any such test which goes beyond the perturbatively ",
    "calculable hard  scattering framework necessarily involves additional nonperturbative assumptions or inputs , for example in modelling the polarized proton wave function .",
    "0.3 cm    one such model has recently been proposed @xcite , in which a valence quark core with ( essentially ) the nave quark model spin content may be accompanied by a spin ",
    "triplet @xmath24 pair in which the @xmath25 antiquark is supposed to be negatively polarized , motivated by chiral dynamics , and likewise the @xmath26 quark , motivated by @xmath27 quark condensation in the vacuum : @xmath28 this model has been shown to reproduce qualitatively experimental features of @xmath29 production in @xmath30 annihilation and used to make further predictions for @xmath29 and @xmath31 production @xcite , and for depolarization in @xmath32 @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "our model predictions differ from those that could be expected in models with a large polarized gluon distribution in the proton wave function .",
    "0.3 cm    in this paper we first point out that our polarized ",
    "@xmath24 model @xcite provides a natural interpretation of data on longitudinal @xmath0 polarization in the target fragmentation region in deep ",
    "inelastic @xmath33 collisions . in our model",
    ", the polarized @xmath34 emitted by the @xmath35 selects a polarized quark from the target nucleon wave function .",
    "any @xmath24 pair in the remnant wave function would have the opposite polarization , which can be transferred to final  state @xmath0 polarization .",
    "this is indeed observed to be negative , and the polarization transfer efficiency seems to be about @xmath36 .",
    "a polarized  gluon model appears likely to yield the opposite sign of @xmath0 polarization in the target fragmentation region . 0.3 cm    we then use our model to make predictions for @xmath0 polarization in deep ",
    "inelastic @xmath37 or @xmath3 collisions . in this case",
    ", the polarized @xmath38 or @xmath39 beam emits a virtual photon with non  zero longitudinal polarization , which in turn selects preferentially one polarization state of the struck quark . in our model",
    ", the opposite polarization of a remnant @xmath24 pair can again be transferred to final  state @xmath0 polarization , with the efficiency extracted from @xmath33 collisions .",
    "we present detailed predictions for @xmath0 polarization in the target fragmentation region for both polarized and unpolarized targets , and also make predictions for correlations between @xmath0 and @xmath40 polarization measurements in the current and target fragmentation regions .",
    "0.3 cm    the layout of this paper is as follows . our model for polarized @xmath41 distributions in the nucleon wave function",
    "is reviewed in section 2 .",
    "our interpretation of the @xmath33 data is presented in section 3 , accompanied by quantitative results for different kinematic regions obtained using the lepto monte carlo program .",
    "this program is then used in section 4 to make quantitative predictions for the target and current fragmentation regions in @xmath2 and @xmath3 scattering , and correlation measurements are discussed in section 5 .",
    "finally , in section 6 we draw some conclusions and compare our predictions with what might be expected qualitatively in a polarized  gluon model . 0.3 cm",
    "@xmath14 results from the deep ",
    "inelastic scattering experiments @xcite clearly indicate that the contribution of light quarks to the spin of the proton is small : @xmath42 .",
    "this comes as a surprise from the point of view of the nave constituent quark model , which would suggest @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the experimental data also allow to extract the separate contributions of @xmath45 and @xmath26 quarks @xcite : @xmath46 strange quarks therefore appear to have a net polarization opposite to the proton spin . though the matrix elements @xmath47 and @xmath48 involve both valence and sea quarks , the small value of @xmath49 suggests that the light quark sea is also negatively polarized , so as to compensate to large extent the spin carried by the valence quarks .",
    "0.3 cm    the origin of this negative sea polarization is likely nonperturbative and still has to be understood .",
    "one model motivated by chiral dynamics has recently been proposed @xcite .",
    "it is based on two major observations .",
    "first , the fact that the masses of goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken @xmath50 chiral symmetry  pions and kaons  are small at the typical hadronic scale can be attributed to the existence of effective strong attraction between quarks and antiquarks in the pseudoscalar @xmath51 channel .",
    "secondly , from phenomenological analyses of the quark condensates in the framework of the qcd sum rules @xcite , @xcite it is known that the density of quark - antiquark pairs in nonperturbative vacuum is quite high : @xmath52 it is worthwile to note that eq([cond ] ) indicates that the density of strange quarks in the vacuum is comparable to the density of @xmath53 and @xmath54 quarks .",
    "0.3 cm    let us now consider , following @xcite , the basic @xmath55 proton state immersed in the qcd vacuum .",
    "the strong attraction in the spin - singlet pseudoscalar channel discussed above will induce correlations between valence quarks from the proton wave function and vacuum antiquarks with opposite spins . as a consequence of this",
    ", the spin of the antiquarks will be aligned _ opposite _ to the proton spin .",
    "moreover , we note that in order to preserve the vacuum quantum numbers ( @xmath56 ) , quark - antiquark pairs must be in a relative spin - triplet , @xmath57 @xmath27 state .",
    "therefore the spin of vacuum sea quarks must also be aligned _ opposite _ to the proton spin .",
    "the resulting wave function of the proton will therefore contain negatively polarized @xmath58 components , which will effectively decrease the fraction of the proton spin carried by quarks .",
    "the negative contribution to the spin will be compensated by a positive contribution from orbital angular momentum , so the total angular momentum sum rule of course will be satisfied .",
    "the proposed mechanism can be interpreted as an effective vacuum  screening \" of the quark ( and proton ) spin in the nonperturbative vacuum with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry .",
    "0.3 cm    in view of ( [ cond ] ) , this mechanism should be applicable to @xmath4 components as well as @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "therefore we expect that the proton wave function will contains a considerable admixture with an @xmath24 component : @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes fock space components not containing @xmath4 pairs , and the dots denote components with two or more @xmath4 pairs , which we assume to be negligible so that @xmath63 .",
    "the simplest wave function of the @xmath64 containing component , consistent with the dynamical chirality and spin arguments discussed above , corresponds to a spin - triplet , polarized @xmath65 @xmath24 pair with angular momentum @xmath66 coupled to the  usual \" @xmath67 @xmath55 valence state .",
    "0.3 cm    within this general framework , it is possible to imagine that each constituent quark , in a nave quark model for the proton wave function , contains a valence @xmath53 or @xmath54 quark with the same polarization as the parent constituent quark , and its own individual sea of @xmath68 pairs with the above - mentioned spin correlations . in a deep - inelastic scattering event in which one of the valence quarks is struck",
    ", it might be a good approximation to consider its parent constituent quark as being the only one dissociated , with the other constituent quarks left essentially intact as spectators . in this refinement of the model of @xcite ,",
    "the polarization of the remnant @xmath4 pair would be 100% anticorrelated with that of the struck valence quark ( or its parent constituent quark ) .",
    "0.3 cm    the  experimental \" value ( [ delta ] ) suggests that @xmath69 which is consistent with the limits derived from the phenomenology of @xmath24 production in @xmath30 annihilation @xcite : @xmath70 this polarized intrinsic strangeness model has been shown to reproduce qualitatively the channel  dependent , non  universal excess of @xmath29 production in @xmath30 annihilation at rest observed recently at lear @xcite . within this approach , a large apparent violation of the ozi rule",
    "is interpreted in terms of  rearrangement \" and  shake  out \" of an intrinsic @xmath24 component of the nucleon wave function .",
    "0.3 cm    the self  analyzing properties of @xmath0 ( @xmath40 ) make this particle especially interesting for spin physics .",
    "this hyperon can be used as a @xmath26 quark polarimeter since the polarization of @xmath0 is defined by polarization of its @xmath26 quark .",
    "the production of @xmath71 pairs in @xmath72 annihilation in our model is viewed @xcite as the dissociation of a spin - triplet @xmath24 pair from the initial proton or antiproton into a @xmath71 state .",
    "since the spin of the @xmath0 is carried by the spin of the strange quark , this ( spin  correlation  conserving ) dissociation leads to a spin  triplet final state for the two hyperons .",
    "this is indeed consistent with the experimental observation @xcite that the spin ",
    "singlet fraction in the @xmath71 final state is equal to zero within statistical errors .",
    "since the initial @xmath24 pair carries a polarization opposite to the ( anti)proton spin , the model also predicts that the spin of the final @xmath73 @xmath71 pair is polarized in the direction opposite to the spin of initial spin - triplet @xmath72 state , and therefore the depolarization @xmath74 is negative .",
    "this prediction can be tested experimentally in the near future @xcite .",
    "it is , however , important to test the polarized intrinsic strangeness model in the same kinematical conditions in which the contribution of the strange quarks to the spin of the proton @xmath75 is measured , i.e. , in deep ",
    "inelastic scattering .",
    "in the next sections we will discuss the consequences of this model for the polarization of the @xmath0 s produced in deep ",
    "inelastic scattering .",
    "0.3 cm    @xmath14 measurements of @xmath0 polarization have been made in the target fragmentation region ( @xmath77 ) in @xmath35 and @xmath76 deep - inelastic scattering experiments  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "non - trivial _ negative _ longitudinal polarization , measured with respect to the direction of the momentum transfer from the beam , has been observed in two experiments  @xcite-@xcite , whereas the data on transverse @xmath0 polarization are quite contradictory .",
    "the longitudinal - polarization data of the wa59 experiment  @xcite have the best statistical accuracy , and in this section we present an interpretation of these data using the simple model of the polarized nucleon wave function described in section 2 .",
    "0.3 cm    the essence of our argument is that the right - handed polarization of the @xmath76 beam is transferred to the hadrons via polarized @xmath78-exchange , which selects preferentially one _ longitudinal _ polarization state of the nucleon target , which is reflected in nontrivial",
    "_ longitudinal _ polarization of @xmath0 s produced in the target fragmentation region .",
    "specifically , in most interactions the @xmath76-induced @xmath34 removes a _",
    "positively_-polarized @xmath53 quark from the nucleon target , as seen in fig .",
    "1 . the nave model of section 2",
    "then predicts that any @xmath26 quark in the target fragment should have _ negative _ longitudinal polarization , so that the longitudinal @xmath0 polarization should also be _ negative _ , as observed .",
    "0.3 cm    to be more quantitative , we denote by @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) the probability that the longitudinal projection of the remnant @xmath26 quark spin is parallel / antiparallel to that of the struck quark @xmath41 ( antiquark @xmath81 ) , and define the spin - correlation coefficient    @xmath82    0.3 cm    in the nave quark - parton model of deep - inelastic @xmath35 or @xmath76 scattering , the net longitudinal polarization of a remnant @xmath26 quark , @xmath83 , is given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) is the total number of events selected in which a quark ( antiquark ) is struck , and @xmath87 is the total number of events selected .",
    "the antiquarks contribute with a negative sign because their charged - current weak interactions are righthanded .",
    "the relative proportion of @xmath41 and @xmath81 events depend in general on the range of the kinematic variables selected , leading to dependencies of @xmath88 on the kinematic variables , as we discuss in more detail below .",
    "0.3 cm    according to the simple polarization model discussed in the previous section , the polarization of the remnant @xmath26 quark is 100% _ anticorrelated _ with that of the valence quark , and 100% _ correlated _ with that of struck sea @xmath89 antiquark ( see fig .",
    "2 ) :    @xmath90    the correlation of the remnant @xmath26 quark polarization with that of any other struck sea quark depends whether they come from the same parent constituent quark .",
    "if yes , which might be the dominant case , we would expect    @xmath91    if no , however , the correlation would be reduced .",
    "the predictions we present later are insensitive to the value of @xmath92 in the region of bjorken @xmath93 , and also for lower @xmath94 in @xmath5 scattering",
    ". for definiteness we use ( [ csqs ] ) in the following . 0.3 cm    according to the simple quark model of the polarized @xmath0 wave function ,",
    "the polarization of a directly - produced @xmath0 is the same as that of the remnant @xmath26 quark .",
    "however , final - state @xmath0 s may also be produced indirectly via the decays of heavier hyperon resonances , which tends to dilute the @xmath0 polarization by a factor we denote by @xmath95 .",
    "thus the final - state longitudinal @xmath0 polarization is @xmath96 where @xmath88 is given by equation ( [ ps ] ) .",
    "the fraction of @xmath0 s produced indirectly may vary with the kinematical conditions , e.g. , it may be higher when the invariant mass of the produced hadron system is larger .",
    "0.3 cm    we have used the latest version of the lund monte carlo program lepto6.2",
    "@xcite , with default values of parameters , to obtain numerical results .",
    "this program provides a good description of the existing data on unpolarized semi  inclusive hadron production in deep ",
    "inelastic scattering .",
    "we implement into it the spin correlations following from our model ( see ( [ ccss ] ) , ( [ csqs ] ) ) . we have generated a sample of deep - inelastic events with the @xmath76 energy set equal to the average value in the wa59 experiment , using its target composition and kinematical cuts , and then selected events with @xmath0 s produced in the target fragmentation region .",
    "we present in table 1 our results for the polarization @xmath88 of the remnant @xmath26 quark in various ranges of bjorken @xmath94 , together with the corresponding values of @xmath97 measured in wa59 experiment .",
    "we also tabulate the corresponding values of @xmath95 inferred from our calculated values of @xmath88 and the measured values of @xmath97 .",

    "@xmath99 pair production is that of fig .",
    "4 , where the @xmath99 produced in the target fragmentation region inherits the polarization of the @xmath89 quark . at all values of @xmath100",
    "the dominant mechanism of associated @xmath101 production is scattering on the valence @xmath53 quark .",
    "for this reason , in contrast to the previous case , in the polarized - gluon model we would expect the opposite sign for the @xmath0 and @xmath99 polarizations .",
    "@xmath14 we have discussed in this paper ways in which measurements of @xmath0 polarization in deep - inelastic final states may cast light on the proton spin puzzle .",
    "our suggestion is that @xmath0 s in the target fragmentation region are likely to have longitudinal polarization inherited from that of remnant @xmath26 quarks in the struck nucleon .",
    "we use a simple model  @xcite of the nucleon spin structure in which the @xmath26 and @xmath89 polarizations are anticorrelated with that of any valence quark struck by the polarized lepton probe .",
    "our model reproduces successfully the sign , magnitude and @xmath94 dependence of the longitudinal @xmath0 polarization measured in the wa59 deep - inelastic @xmath5 experiment in the target fragmentation region .",
    "we have also applied the model to make predictions for the longitudinal polarization of @xmath0 s in the target fragmentation region in deep - inelastic @xmath6 scattering off either a polarized or an unpolarized target , which are shown in fig .",
    "6 , and polarized deep - inelastic @xmath102 scattering , as shown in fig .",
    ". 0.3 cm    a preliminary monte - carlo study shows  @xcite that the proposed new cern experiment could collect in one year of data taking about @xmath103 events with @xmath0 s produced in the target fragmentation region ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "after kinematical cuts @xmath93 and @xmath105 , several thousand deep - inelastic events will be retained , which is higher by an order of magnitude than in the wa59 experiment .",
    "taking into account the predicted degree of polarization , it seems that the proposed new experiment at cern  @xcite is capable of performing measurements of @xmath0 polarization with sufficient accuracy to test our model . 0.3 cm    we emphasize that our model for the nucleon spin structure is not rigorous , and represents an extrapolation of our present knowledge of polarized structure functions  @xcite .",
    "it relies on the interpretation of these data as due to polarized @xmath4 pairs in nucleon  @xcite , rather than polarized gluons  @xcite .",
    "the development of this latter model to make predictions for @xmath0 polarization in deep - inelastic scattering lies beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , as we have indicated in previous sections , it seems to us likely that a plausible extrapolation of the polarized - gluon model would predict the opposite sign for longitudinal @xmath0 polarization in the target fragmentation region in deep - inelastic @xmath106 and @xmath6 or @xmath107 scattering .",
    "it seems to us that it would be interesting for advocates of the polarized - gluon interpretation of the polarized structure - function data to examine this question . as we discussed in the previous paragraph ,",
    "the statistics for @xmath0 production in the proposed new experiment at cern  @xcite are likely to be sufficient to determine the sign of the @xmath0 longitudinal polarization , and may therefore be able to cast some light on the proton spin puzzle .",
