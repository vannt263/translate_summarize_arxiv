    "compositeness @xcite is regarded as a solution to many problems which are unsolved in the standard model , like the fermion mass spectrum , the generation of masses and the large number of parameters .",
    "the idea is that some underlying structure can explain the quark and lepton family pattern . at this stage",
    ", we shall search for new excited fermions ( @xmath9 ) , and for new interactions originated from the constituents .    a signal for",
    "a composite structure of fermions could be the production of excited leptons or quarks , either pairwise , due to their normal gauge couplings , or singly , due to radiative transitions between normal and excited fermions @xcite @xcite .",
    "for instance , excited fermions could be produced in @xmath10 decays ; in fact , there are strong limits coming from the @xmath11 partial widths .",
    "mass regions up to @xmath12 gev for @xmath13 and @xmath14 as well as @xmath15 gev for @xmath16 and @xmath17 have been excluded @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath16 limits can be pushed to @xmath18 gev by searching the decay mode @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "moreover , recently the possibility has been studied that the significant excess from qcd predictions found by the collider detector at fermilab ( cdf ) in the inclusive jet cross section for transverse energies @xmath20 gev could be explained by the production of excited bosons or excited quarks in the mass region of @xmath21 gev and @xmath22 gev@xcite @xcite , respectively .",
    "other studies have already been done in order to get the low energy scale @xmath23 for compositeness by precise comparison between currently available experimental data and calculations in the composite model of quarks @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , radiative corrections are the appropriate place to indirectly look for new physics at low energies @xcite @xcite , because when heavy fermions are coupled to longitudinal components of the gauge bosons there is no decoupling of the high energy physics from the low energy physics . in ref .",
    "@xcite , radiative corrections at the @xmath10 scale have been considered in order to bound substructure .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to find bounds for the masses of possible excited leptons by using the radiative corrections involved in the forward - backward and left - right asymmetries for the lepton average .",
    "in general , the normal fermions ( @xmath24 ) and excited fermions ( @xmath25 ) at low energies can be described by an effective lagrangian like @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the field strengths for the gauge bosons and @xmath28 denotes the compositeness scale . in particular , we choose a specific model which assumes that excited leptons form a weak isodoublet , @xmath29 which couples to the ordinary left handed lepton doublet by the @xmath30 invariant interaction lagrangian @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the @xmath34 and @xmath35 coupling constants respectively , @xmath36 denotes the pauli matrices and @xmath37 is the hypercharge .    as for the coefficients @xmath38 and @xmath39 , in general , @xmath40 measurements imply @xmath41 , and also , the absence of dipole moments for the electron and the muon requires @xmath42 and @xmath43 to be relatively real @xcite .",
    "thus , we have the following relations :    @xmath44    now , since the excited fermions are doublets , their couplings to photon , @xmath10 and @xmath45 bosons are defined by the following renormalizable lagrangian @xmath46 where the coefficients @xmath47 from eq.(1 ) satisfy @xmath48",
    "once we have the framework setup ( eqs . ( 1)-(6 ) ) , we can calculate the contribution to the self - energies of the gauge bosons by using dimensional regularization , where the pole @xmath49 is identified with @xmath50 @xcite . in order to simplify the analysis we assume the same mass for the excited leptons , @xmath51 ;",
    "this is justified by the fact that we are considering the excited fermion in a linear vectorial representation of the @xmath52 gauge group .",
    "the states with equal mass for @xmath53 and @xmath54 do not break the symmetry .",
    "in general the self - energies due to the lagrangians of dimension 5 and 4 are : @xmath55 where the functions @xmath56 can be written as @xcite @xmath57   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & 3m^{\\ast 2}q^{2}[1+(\\frac{m^{\\ast 2}-q^{2}}{q^{2}})\\ln ( \\frac{m^{\\ast 2}}{% m^{\\ast 2}-q^{2 } } ) ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & -&q^{4}[8 + 3\\ln ( \\frac{\\lambda ^{2}}{m^{\\ast 2}})-3(\\frac{m^{\\ast 2}-q^{2}}{% q^{2}})\\ln ( \\frac{m^{\\ast 2}}{m^{\\ast 2}-q^{2}})\\;\\ ; ,   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "f^{(4)}(m^{\\ast } , q^{2 } ) & = & q^{2}\\ln \\frac{\\lambda ^{2}}{m^{\\ast 2}}% + 4m^{\\ast 2}+\\frac{5}{3}q^{2 }   \\nonumber \\\\ &",
    "-&2(2m^{\\ast 2}+q^{2})\\sqrt{\\frac{4m^{\\ast 2}}{q^{2}}-1}\\arctan ( \\frac{1}{% \\sqrt{\\frac{4m^{\\ast 2}}{q^{2}}-1}})\\;\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have considered the ordinary lepton masses negligible . therefore , we find the vacuum polarization tensors for the gauge bosons : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 is obtained directly from @xmath61 . the asymptotic limits @xmath62 in the functions @xmath63are    @xmath64    in such limit , @xmath65 approaches a constant value and the physics described by ( 3 ) is non - decoupled .",
    "on the other hand , the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath0 and the left - right asymmetry @xmath1 for leptons in the @xmath10 decays are given by @xmath66 where a @xmath67 amplitude is defined as @xmath68 and the superscripts @xmath69 denote electron , lepton respectively . in our case , new physics is included in the constants @xmath70 as @xmath71 where the superindex sm denotes the sm coupling with the contribution at one loop level of the top quark and higgs scalar boson . in this way , @xmath72 only contains the new physics contribution . with this prescription",
    "we find that @xmath73 and @xmath1 can be written as @xmath74 where @xmath75 has the contribution of new physics and @xmath76    additionally , these couplings @xmath77 can be expressed in terms of the @xmath78 parameters @xcite , @xmath79 here , @xmath80 is the @xmath2 vertex correction given in @xcite .",
    "the other two parameters @xmath81 and @xmath82 can be written as a function of self - energies as given by eq .",
    "( 9 ) @xcite .",
    "we consider the asymmetries for electron and leptonic average .",
    "the sm predicted values are @xcite @xmath83 for @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 gev and @xmath87 gev . and the experimental values are @xcite : @xmath88    notice that the standard model value @xmath89goes 1.54@xmath90out from experimental data .",
    "figure 1 shows the @xmath0 as a function of the scale @xmath91 for values of @xmath92 gev ( a ) and @xmath93 gev ( b ) .",
    "different values of the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath94 have been considered .",
    "figure 2 shows @xmath1 as a function of the scale @xmath95 for the excited lepton mass of @xmath93 gev ( a ) and @xmath96 gev ( b ) . in figure 3",
    "we have plotted @xmath0 of the electron versus @xmath5 , as @xmath95 is the energy scale for new physics , @xmath97 must be less than @xmath95 , and we have @xmath98between @xmath99and @xmath100 . in figure 4",
    "we show the left - right asymmetry versus the quotient @xmath101 for different values of @xmath102and @xmath103couple constants .",
    "we can see that both forward - backward and left - right asymmetries produce bounds for such quotient when @xmath104overweight considerably to @xmath105it means that custodial symmetry is strongly broken and therefore radiative contributions become higher@xmath106",
    "in conclusion , we have evaluated the contribution of excited lepton states , up to one - loop level , to the oblique parameters .",
    "we have included this contribution into the leptonic asymmetries @xmath107and @xmath1 , and we have compared our results with the precise data on the electroweak observables obtained by lep and lsd collaborations @xcite @xcite . therefore , we can extract bounds on the compositeness scale and the excited lepton mass in the context of the phenomenological model under consideration .",
    "further , in equation ( 3 ) the term proportional to @xmath108 breakdowns the custodial symmetry and it is proportional to the constant @xmath7 .",
    "otherwise the new physics is allowed in the experimental region ( @xmath109 , which is satisfied when custodial symmetry is strongly broken .  in order to get this requirement",
    "we need that @xmath94 becomes bigger than @xmath8 . with this prescription",
    "we obtain bounds on  the rate @xmath110",
