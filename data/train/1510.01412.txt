    "lhcb has recently observed  @xcite two exotic states , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , at high significance in the @xmath5 spectrum of @xmath6 .",
    "in addition to extracting the state masses and widths , the collaboration also measured the phases of the production amplitude and found them to be compatible with genuine resonant behavior .",
    "such properties strongly support the assertion that true pentaquark states have at last been revealed .",
    "should the @xmath7 states be confirmed at another experiment , they will join @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 exotic mesons ( widely believed to have valence tetraquark structure ) as the first hadrons observed at high significance to lie outside of the textbook @xmath11-meson , @xmath12-baryon paradigm .    of particular note",
    "is that all of the observed exotic states contain @xmath13 ( or @xmath14 ) pairs .",
    "the possibility of light - flavor ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) tetraquarks or pentaquarks has been discussed for decades , but despite intense experimental efforts , no unambiguous signal of such a state has ever survived scrutiny . nor has a singly - heavy hadron ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , _ etc .",
    "_ ) been identified as unambiguously exotic .",
    "one possible explanation for this first appearance in doubly - heavy channels , as argued implicitly in ref .",
    "@xcite and explicitly in refs .",
    "@xcite , is that the exotic consists of two components , each of which contains a heavy quark and therefore is fairly compact , and which are separated from each other in the sense of having a suppressed large wave function overlap .",
    "such a configuration is much more difficult to realize with light quarks .",
    "while this scenario could be achieved by hadronic molecules ( for instance , if the famous @xmath20 tetraquark candidate has a @xmath21 valence - quark structure organized into a @xmath22 molecule ) , in this paper we use the innovation of ref .",
    "@xcite to assert the existence of hadrons formed of separating _ colored _ components that are individually held together by the attractive @xmath23 color interaction , and collectively prevented from separating asymptotically far due to color confinement .",
    "if the existence of observable exotics is contingent upon each of its components containing a heavy quark , then one may hope that some vestige of the exotic behavior persists in analogous production mechanisms with valence @xmath24 rather than @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) quark pairs . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the observed tetraquark states were argued to arise from a rapidly separating diquark - antidiquark pair , @xmath25 ( @xmath26 in the following generically indicates @xmath15 or @xmath16 quarks ) that subsequently hadronizes only through the large-@xmath27 tails of meson wave functions stretching from the quarks in the diquarks to the antiquarks in the antidiquarks .",
    "this picture was extended in ref .",
    "@xcite to explain the pentaquark states as an analogous diquark - anti_triquark _ pair ( this combination having been first proposed for lighter - quark pentaquarks in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath28_{\\bf 3}$ ] , where the @xmath29 diquark is inherited from the parent @xmath19 baryon , and the triquark is seen to assemble from a further @xmath30 attraction .",
    "a short review of these papers appears in ref .",
    "if this mechanism produces such prominent effects in the @xmath13 system as pentaquark resonances , then one may hope to see at least a remnant of the mechanism in the @xmath24 system , in the form of peculiar features appearing in the data .",
    "shortly after the lhcb announcement , multiple theoretical papers appeared , discussing various interpretations of the @xmath7 states and advocating for experiments in which to study them . among the latter ,",
    "three separate collaborations  @xcite proposed using @xmath31 photoproduction of nucleons @xmath32 as sensitive tests of the internal structure of the @xmath33 states . in each case",
    ", the @xmath13 pair arises through the dissociation of the incoming photon . by the reasoning of the previous paragraph",
    ", one may therefore ask if any unusual features have arisen in the analogous @xmath24 process of @xmath0 photoproduction , @xmath34 .",
    "in fact , a detailed experimental study of @xmath0 photoproduction was also published fairly recently by the clas collaboration at jefferson lab  @xcite .",
    "data in the neutral ( @xmath35 ) mode are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite the most interesting feature in the cross section data is a forward - angle `` bump '' structure at @xmath36  gev ( about 250  mev above threshold ) that rises about a factor 23 above a more mildly varying curve in @xmath37 .",
    "however , this structure appears only at the most forward angles ( in which @xmath0 lies in the same direction as @xmath38 in the center - of - momentum [ c.m .",
    "] frame ) , and as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , such a unidirectional structure almost certainly does not indicate a resonance .",
    "in addition , the cross section data indicate a small but clear increase at the most backward angles ( a factor of perhaps 50 smaller than the forward peak ) ; while ref .  @xcite mentions a possible origin for backward enhancement in the @xmath15-channel exchange of a nucleon",
    ", they also comment that such a direct @xmath0-@xmath39 coupling would require a nucleon strangeness content or a violation of ozi suppression surprisingly larger than expected .    here",
    "we argue that both features can be explained in a very simple way : a fraction of @xmath0 photoproduction events proceed through a constituent exchange between the @xmath38 ( dissociated into an @xmath40 state ) and the nucleon [ treated as a bound state of a @xmath29 diquark and a light quark @xmath26 ] ( fig .",
    "[ fig : exchange ] ) .",
    "the scattering products are a diquark - antitriquark pair , @xmath42_{\\bf 3}$ ] , completely analogous to the construction proposed for the @xmath7 resonances , but as experiment indicates , nonresonant in this case .",
    "photoproduction via creation of an @xmath43 diquark-@xmath44_{\\bf 3}$ ] antitriquark pair . ]",
    "that is , the anomalies correspond to `` would - be '' pentaquarks .",
    "the enhancement in the forward and backward directions , with the forward direction favored , is explained by the preference of the diquark and triquark to minimize momentum transfer by aligning with the @xmath45 process axis .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : momtrans ] we discuss the forward - backward enhancement of hadronic cross sections driven by constituent - exchange momentum transfers .",
    "a simple model based upon minimal gluon exchanges is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , and the calculation and results are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "section  [ sec : concl ] summarizes and concludes .",
    "one of the quintessential triumphs of quantum field theory is its natural prediction of a rutherford - type differential scattering cross section , in which the invariant amplitude @xmath46 for the process @xmath47 ( using momenta to label the particles ) scales as the inverse of the 4-momentum transfer @xmath48 .",
    "a dependence @xmath49 arises from the virtual exchange of a quantum of mass @xmath50 of the mediating interaction .",
    "for example , in @xmath51 elastic scattering the quantum ( at least at low energies ) may be considered a single neutral virtual meson , such as @xmath52 . at higher energies ,",
    "the relevant degrees of freedom exchanged become quarks and gluons .",
    "elastic scattering via mediators of negligible mass also features the characteristic rutherford angular dependence @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the c.m .",
    "scattering angle .",
    "inelastic @xmath55 scattering ( and scattering with heavier mediators ) also contains this factor , although the relation is then no longer a strict proportionality , and the effect is muted . in either case",
    ", however , the @xmath56 factor indicates strong peaking of @xmath57 in the forward direction , and for precisely the reason that rutherford understood : greater particle deflections demand stronger forces , requiring scattering events that , for given fixed initial - particle energies , are comparatively rarer . if the scattered particles @xmath58 can not be unambiguously associated with the initial particles @xmath59 , respectively  as occurs either if @xmath59 represent identical particles , or if the reaction is sufficiently inelastic that the association is less than perfect  then one also expects an enhancement in @xmath46 corresponding to the minimization of the 4-momentum transfer @xmath60 . @xmath15",
    "contains the factor @xmath61 , which means that @xmath46 also peaks in the backward direction .",
    "a prominent and historically important example of this forward - backward peaking occurs in @xmath62 elastic scattering .",
    "indeed , the strong backward peak , now understood to be due to the charge - exchange reaction @xmath63 in which charged mesons are traded between the nucleons , is one of the best pieces of evidence for strong interactions respecting fundamental isospin symmetry , particularly the equivalence of @xmath39 and @xmath64 under strong interactions : in @xmath62 scattering the backward peak is almost as high as the forward peak , because @xmath39 turns into @xmath64 and vice versa but remains otherwise undeflected .",
    "it is interesting to note ( as discussed , _",
    "e.g. _ , in ref .",
    "@xcite ) that simple one - pion exchange , which one might naively expect to be responsible for the full peak , is actually well known to lead to a zero differential cross section at 180@xmath65 . at the constituent level , a quark exchange @xmath66 occurs .    for inelastic processes , the rule of thumb for estimating the relative height of",
    "the forward and backward peaks appears to follow from the similarity of the initial and final particles .",
    "taking @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) to be the lighter initial ( final ) particle , one expects the forward peak to be generically higher . as an explicit example , consider @xmath69 photoproduction ; here , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "the recent clas data for this process  @xcite shows a backward peak in the differential cross section that is a factor of a few smaller than the forward peak ( the ratio depending strongly upon @xmath37 , reaching a maximum of about 1/2 around 2.1  gev ) , supporting the general dynamical picture described here .",
    "indeed , a small modification of fig .",
    "[ fig : exchange ] provides a simple quark - exchange picture for @xmath74 photoproduction : just exchange @xmath75 .",
    "the preference of forward ( @xmath76 ) scattering indicates the relative dynamical preference for not diverting the ( heavier ) baryon line .",
    "alternately , at the constituent level for @xmath69 one sees that the lightest constituent @xmath26 ( and @xmath17 ) suffers a backward scattering for @xmath77 , while the heavier @xmath29 diquark ( and @xmath78 ) remains undeflected .",
    "nevertheless , one expects a smaller enhancement for @xmath79 as well , where the momentum transfers of @xmath26 and @xmath17 are minimized .",
    "once the scattered particles in a @xmath55 process are resolved into constituents , the overall momentum transfer @xmath80 is no longer the only independent kinematical quantity contributing to angular dependence .",
    "the dominant diagram for @xmath81 is generally attributed to pomeron exchange  @xcite , in which the @xmath38 dissociates into the @xmath24 pair .",
    "couples directly to the @xmath32 , and the @xmath82 pair is created from gluons emitted from the struck @xmath32 . at high energies , the latter diagram actually appears to be dominant  @xcite .",
    "] at the level of fundamental qcd , the corresponding feynman diagrams include as their most simple representative fig .",
    "[ fig : pomeron ] , although the full pomeron would include many more gluons , particularly those cross - linking the exchanged gluon pair in this figure .    .",
    "]    the gluon exchanged between the final - state @xmath24 pair merely indicates that , in order for the four constituents to interact , share momentum , and be diverted to their final directions , a minimum of three gluons must be exchanged is treated as a single unit in the scattering . ] . in fact , the complete diagrams are even more complicated than indicated because we have represented the nucleon @xmath32 as a bound pair of a light quark @xmath26 and a diquark @xmath29 ; indeed , the gluons can couple separately to either of the quarks in @xmath29 , the nucleon can contain both scalar and vector diquarks , and the quark @xmath26 must be properly antisymmetrized with the identical quark in @xmath29 to satisfy fermi statistics  @xcite . nevertheless , fig .  [",
    "fig : pomeron ] illustrates the central point that the pomeron carries the entirety of the momentum transfer @xmath80 in the @xmath83-channel , suggesting ( as is observed ) strong forward peaking of the differential cross section , while a @xmath15-channel backward peak would require a complicated intermediate state carrying not only a pomeron , but also nonzero baryon number and hidden strangeness .",
    "we propose an additional mechanism for @xmath0 photoproduction , namely , the production of an @xmath84 color-@xmath85 bound diquark @xmath86 and an @xmath87 $ ] color-*3 * bound antitriquark @xmath88 , as in fig .  [",
    "fig : exchange ] . in this case",
    ", @xmath29 truly does refer to a diquark component in @xmath32 , which at first blush can be either of the `` good '' ( scalar - isoscalar ) or `` bad '' ( vector - isovector ) variety , although data from charge and magnetic nucleon radii prefer the `` good '' component  @xcite , once proper antisymmetrization of the wave function between @xmath26 and @xmath29 is performed . in comparison , in the case of @xmath74 photoproduction described above , the @xmath89 contains only the `` good '' @xmath29 diquark .",
    "the importance of including diquark baryon substructure in ads / qcd models to obtain regge trajectories matching those of mesons ( as is observed ) , is emphasized in refs .",
    "@xcite .    since both @xmath86 and @xmath88 are colored objects , hadronization of the pair is accomplished as in refs .",
    "@xcite , by means of the hadron wave functions stretching across the space between the colored bound states .",
    "one can obtain in this way not only a @xmath90 , @xmath91 final state , but also a contribution to the final state @xmath92 , @xmath93 expected to be smaller than the one discussed in the previous section , due to the smaller strength of the @xmath94 attraction compared to that of @xmath95 .    our purpose is not to calculate the complete amplitude for this entire process ( _ e.g. _ , the techniques of ref .",
    "@xcite are useful for the large-@xmath54 region ) , but only to demonstrate that a natural physical mechanism exists to provide an interaction producing an enhanced cross section in both the forward and backward directions .",
    "we can therefore make a number of simplifying assumptions .",
    "first , we neglect fermi motion within the @xmath86 and @xmath88 , so that the constituents within each bound state move with the same velocity ( this assumption can be lifted by folding in appropriate distribution functions ; _",
    "e.g. _ , in the light - front formalism , see ref .",
    "then it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : exchange ] that forward @xmath96 scattering of @xmath84 also produces a forward - scattered @xmath0 , since in the c.m.@xmath84 and @xmath87 $ ] have the same momentum magnitude , but the former is lighter and therefore has a larger speed . in turn",
    ", @xmath17 has a larger speed than @xmath78 .",
    "since @xmath97 , the net momentum of @xmath98 then points in the same direction as @xmath17 , and hence , as @xmath84 .",
    "this strategy has much in common with the `` hard scattering approach '' ( hsa ) developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , in that both take all constituents to move collinear with their parent hadrons , include the minimal necessary number of gluon exchanges to accomplish the process , and require folding in appropriate distribution amplitudes .",
    "the hsa approach applied to @xmath0 photoproduction at high energy scales ( with genuinely hard gluons ) has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , although using older data than here .",
    "since the diagrams again have four constituents , the minimum number of gluon exchanges necessary for the process remains three .",
    "unlike in pomeron exchange , however , the @xmath86-@xmath88 production mechanism provides natural alternatives that produce enhancements in the forward and backward directions .",
    "consider first fig .",
    "[ fig : gluon1 ] ; here , the scattering process is driven by the lightest constituent ( @xmath26 ) from either of the initial particles ( @xmath32 ) exchanging a gluon with the @xmath78 constituent of the other initial particle ( @xmath38 ) .    , but including a minimal gluon exchange that naturally explains the enhancement of @xmath0 production in the @xmath77 direction , as described in the text . ]    as just discussed , the @xmath86-@xmath88 configuration favored for forward @xmath0 production is the one in which @xmath84 is also produced in the forward direction , recoiling against @xmath87 $ ] . since the lightest constituent ( here , @xmath26 ) is the easiest to deflect through large angles , this particular exchange diagram provides a natural mechanism for backward scattering of the @xmath26 , as well as that of the @xmath78 .",
    "once the @xmath26 and @xmath78 are deflected through a large angle , the @xmath17 and @xmath29 must each be deflected ( through a generically smaller angle ) to become bound to into their respective @xmath84 and @xmath99 $ ] combinations .",
    "this binding is accomplished in our crude picture by the exchange of a gluon between @xmath17 and @xmath26 , and between @xmath78 and @xmath29 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : gluon1 ] . as promised , the minimal number of gluon exchanges required to achieve the desired final states is precisely three .",
    "one therefore naively expects this diagram to peak in the forward direction , and in the next section we see this expectation indeed to be realized .    a natural exchange diagram producing a backward peak",
    "is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : gluon2 ] . here , the interaction gluon connects the heaviest component [ @xmath29 ] to the @xmath17 ,    , but including a minimal gluon exchange that naturally explains the enhancement of @xmath0 production in the @xmath79 direction , as described in the text .",
    "the angle @xmath54 exhibited here is identical to the one in fig .",
    "[ fig : gluon1 ] , for the purpose of ease of comparison . ]    and is expected to produce an enhancement when both of them are deflected in the backward direction , the @xmath79 limit of fig .  [ fig : gluon2 ] . in that case , in order to form the @xmath99 $ ] and @xmath84 combinations , the @xmath78 and @xmath26 deflect through a smaller angle , and binding is accomplished through gluon exchanges between @xmath29 and @xmath78 , and between @xmath17 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "again , a minimum of precisely three gluon exchanges is necessary to obtain the desired final state . and",
    "since backward deflection of the heavier @xmath29 is not as easy as backward deflection of the lighter @xmath26 , one expects the size of the enhancement in the backward direction produced by fig .",
    "[ fig : gluon2 ] to be smaller than the enhancement in the forward direction produced by fig .",
    "[ fig : gluon1 ] , which is verified in the next section to be true .    before proceeding to a calculation",
    ", we hasten to emphasize its extremely rudimentary nature .",
    "first , we are investigating a particular production mechanism ( @xmath86-@xmath88 ) that has never been demonstrated unambiguously to occur in any process .",
    "the @xmath84 and @xmath87 $ ] are assumed to act as bound quasiparticles , allowing for analysis as a @xmath55 process .",
    "second , we suppose that the reaction proceeds through a `` good '' diquark component of the nucleon , which interacts as a unit and maintains its identity throughout the process .",
    "third , we neglect the fermi motion of each composite particle and assume that each initial and final state consists of two collinear components moving at the same velocity .",
    "fourth , we use the minimum required number of gluons for each process , despite the fact that the reaction and binding interactions are most certainly nonperturbative .",
    "no hard scale is present to justify a perturbative treatment , and the gluons here should be thought of only as quasiparticles that accomplish momentum transfer among the components ; in reality , these gluons simply represent collections of multiple gluon exchanges that accomplish the same overall scattering .",
    "in fact , the specific choices of topology for the diagrams in figs .  [",
    "fig : gluon1 ] , [ fig : gluon2 ] , even with the minimal gluon exchange number , are not unique .",
    "for example , while it is tempting to apply the above narrative that the interaction between some of the constituents occurs first , and then the remaining constituents exchange gluons with the scattered components to form bound states , it is just as tenable from a quantum field - theory point of view that the initial constituents @xmath38 and @xmath32 come unbound by gluon exchange first , and then the interaction occurs . or , the binding and unbinding gluons can stretch across the interaction relative to diagrams without them , where @xmath101 is the number of qcd colors . ] . in real qcd ,",
    "one expects _ all _ such gluons to appear  copiously  in a typical diagram .    to establish a systematic calculation",
    ", we consider all 12 diagrams that have the minimum three planar gluons , such that each of the constituents must couple at least once to a gluon .",
    "figures  [ fig : gluon1 ] and  [ fig : gluon2 ] may be considered as representatives of diagram classes [ with amplitudes @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively ] , as defined by the placement of the central interaction gluon that connects initial and final states .",
    "the members of each class are defined by which two external states have their constituents connected by a gluon . in a third allowed class represented by fig .",
    "[ fig : gluon3 ]    , but including a minimal gluon exchange that does not have a natural central interaction gluon connecting initial and final states . ]",
    "[ amplitudes @xmath104 , the constituents of each of three of the external states are connected by a gluon .",
    "the definition of the 12 diagrams is summarized in table  [ table : diags ] ; thus , for example , the amplitudes corresponding to the literal diagrams of figs .",
    "[ fig : gluon1 ] , [ fig : gluon2 ] , and [ fig : gluon3 ] are @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 , respectively .",
    "it is also simple to check that each of these 12 diagrams also has exactly two internal constituent propagators .",
    ".amplitudes based on the classes defined by figs .",
    "[ fig : gluon1 ] , [ fig : gluon2 ] , [ fig : gluon3 ] [ defined as @xmath108 , respectively ] .",
    "each amplitude is defined by its class and the listed subset of initial and final states , each member of which exchanges a single binding gluon .

    "the necessary magnitude of @xmath111 appears to arise largely due to the feature of this simplified model that the initial @xmath17 and @xmath78 quarks from the dissociation of @xmath38 are lightlike , as seen from the first two of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mom_defns ] ) ; presumably , introducing substantial transverse momenta in a more realistic calculation produces the same effect as @xmath111 . in any case , the model presented here is so simple that the input masses used should be viewed only as a qualitative guide to obtaining results in accord with experiment .    for the given inputs , the amplitudes of class @xmath102 are all strongly peaked in the forward direction , while those of class @xmath112 are all strongly peaked in the backward direction but possess in addition a smaller forward peak .",
    "in particular , the amplitude @xmath105 [ @xmath106 ] corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig : gluon1 ] ( fig .  [ fig : gluon2 ] ) shows preferential forward ( backward ) scattering , as was anticipated from general arguments .",
    "the diagrams of class @xmath114 also turn out to be forward enhanced , but many times smaller than those in class @xmath115 . to illustrate the forward - backward peaking , we present in fig .  [ fig : amp_sum ] the simple coherent sum @xmath116 of the 12     of the 12 amplitudes of eq .",
    "( [ eq : amps ] ) using the inputs in table  [ table : inputs ] , as a function of @xmath117 . ]",
    "obviously , the absence of numerous factors in the full feynman amplitudes  not least of which are relative signs leading to destructive interferences  means that the plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : amp_sum ] should only be taken seriously in its coarsest features , namely , a large peak in the forward direction and a small peak in the backward direction .",
    "the particular value for the forward - to - backward ratio is simple to adjust using slightly different inputs .",
    "furthermore , we note that the clas data presented in ref .  @xcite does not extend to the most forward and backward directions ; the limitation @xmath118 is used in fig .",
    "[ fig : amp_sum ] . the literal ratio @xmath119 in fig .",
    "[ fig : amp_sum ] is about 30 .",

    "@xmath37 but otherwise use the mass inputs of table  [ table : inputs ] .",
    "the amplitude , rather than its square , is relevant because its chief contribution to data would presumably appear through interference with the dominant pomeron amplitude .",
    "the full width at half maximum appears to extend from just below 2.0  gev to about 2.4  gev , which is very much like the experimental result presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this model ,",
    "the enhancement is indeed due to a special correlated five - quark configuration , but it is not a literal resonant pentaquark state .",
    "that is , the anomalies may be said to correspond to `` would - be '' pentaquarks .",
    "we have seen that interesting forward - backward enhancements observed in recent data for the photoproduction process @xmath122 can easily be explained through the production of a @xmath1 color-@xmath85 bound diquark and an @xmath87 $ ] color-*3 * bound antitriquark , using the preferential color couplings @xmath123 . such a configuration ( with @xmath124 ) has previously been advocated as an explanation of the exotic charmoniumlike states . here , however , no claim is made that the enhancements are the result of true resonances , but they are predicted to create @xmath17-dependent bumps in the data .",
    "the model relies only on the preference of a system with largely collinear constituents to minimize the constituent momentum transfers .",
    "essentially no dynamics is included ; the minimal set of gluon exchanges used for each diagram does not incorporate color physics in any fundamental way .",
    "likewise , the constituents are assumed at any point in the diagrams to carry only momenta parallel to the bound state in which they occur .",
    "nevertheless , using plausible values for constituent masses , one obtains results in good qualitative , and even semi - quantitative , agreement with experiment .",
    "numerous possible improvements leading to stable and predictive results for this process should certainly be undertaken .",
    "the possibility that diquark / triquark structure can be discerned in lighter quark systems has long been discussed , but the experimental signals have always been tantalizingly vague . in the analogues to the types of experiments already performed or proposed for heavy - quark exotics , one can hope to find a clear indication for these novel structures .",
