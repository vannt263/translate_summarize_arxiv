    "measurements of the @xmath2 boson differential cross section , as a function of energy and direction , provide information about the nature of both the underlying electroweak interaction , and the effects of chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "this differential cross section can be expressed us a function of the helicity cross sections of the @xmath2 , allowing us to study the @xmath2 polarization and associated asymmetries . because of the difficulties in fully reconstructing a @xmath2 boson in three - dimensions at a hadron collider , the complete angular distribution of the @xmath2 has not been determined yet . in this paper",
    "we present the first measurement of two of the four significant leading angular coefficients of the @xmath2 boson produced at a hadron collider .",
    "the total differential cross section for @xmath2 boson production in a hadron collider is given by @xmath10   \\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the transverse momentum and the rapidity of the @xmath2 in the laboratory frame , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the polar and azimuthal angles of the charged lepton from @xmath2 boson decay in the collins - soper ( cs ) frame @xcite .",
    "the factors @xmath15 are the angular coefficients of the @xmath2 boson , which are ratios of the helicity cross sections of the @xmath2 and its total unpolarized cross section @xmath16 .",
    "the cs frame @xcite is the rest - frame of the @xmath2 with a @xmath17-axis that bisects the angle between the proton direction and the direction opposite that of the antiproton ( figure [ csframe ] ) , and it is used because in this frame we can in principle exactly reconstruct the azimuthal angle @xmath14 and the polar quantity @xmath18 .",
    "our ignorance of the @xmath2 boson longitudinal momentum , which is due to our inability to measure the longitudinal momentum of the neutrino , only introduces a two - fold ambiguity on the sign of @xmath19 .",
    "it is common to integrate equation ( [ eq1 ] ) over @xmath12 and study the variation of the angular coefficients as a function of @xmath11 .    to study the angular distribution of the @xmath2 we must choose a particular charge for the boson .",
    "in this paper we consider the @xmath20 bosons ; the @xmath21 bosons in our samples are @xmath22 transformed to be treated as @xmath23 bosons .",
    "the angular coefficients for the @xmath24 are obtained by @xmath22 transforming equation ( [ eq1 ] ) @xcite .    if the @xmath2 is produced with no transverse momentum , it is polarized along the beam axis , due to the v - a nature of the weak interactions and helicity conservation . in that case",
    "@xmath25 is the only non - zero coefficient . if only valence quarks contributed to @xmath2 production , @xmath25 would equal 2 , and the angular distribution given by equation ( [ eq1 ] ) would be @xmath26 , a result that was first verified by the ua1 experiment @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath2 is produced with non - negligible transverse momentum , balanced by the associated production of jets , the rest of the angular coefficients are present , and the cross section depends on the azimuthal angle @xmath14 as well .",
    "the last three angular coefficients @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are non - zero only if gluon loops are present in the production of the @xmath2 boson . hence , in order to study all the angular coefficients and associated helicity cross sections of the @xmath2 boson in a hadron collider , we must consider the production of the @xmath2 with qcd effects up to order @xmath7 .    the importance of the determination of the @xmath2 angular coefficients is discussed in @xcite , and summarized here .",
    "it allows us to measure for the first time the full differential cross section of the @xmath2 and study its polarization , since the angular coefficients are directly related to the helicity cross sections .",
    "it also helps us verify the qcd effects in the production of the @xmath2 up to order @xmath7 .",
    "for example , according to the standard model ( sm ) , @xmath0 is not equal to @xmath30 only if the effects of gluon loops are taken into account .",
    "in addition , @xmath1 is only affected by the gluon - quark interaction and its measurement can be used to constrain the gluon parton distribution functions . moreover , the next - to - leading order angular coefficients @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are @xmath31-odd and @xmath32-odd and may play an important role in direct @xmath22 violation effects in @xmath2 production and decay @xcite . finally , quantitative understanding of the @xmath2 angular distribution could be used to test new theoretical models and to facilitate new discoveries .",
    "rest - frame , then rotate the @xmath33 plane so that it coincides with the @xmath34-@xmath35 plane . finally we rotate the frame around the @xmath12-axis so that the @xmath17-axis bisects the angle between @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the positive @xmath12 axis is selected to have the same direction as @xmath38 . ]    in this paper we present the first measurement of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 angular coefficients of the @xmath2 boson .",
    "these coefficients fully describe the azimuthal differential cross section of the @xmath2 boson , and they are two of the four significant coefficients that describe the total differential cross section of the @xmath2 , given that @xmath39 and the next - to - leading order angular coefficients have considerably lower values @xcite .",
    "this measurement is accomplished using the azimuthal angle of the charged lepton in the cs @xmath2 rest - frame @xcite , and is presented as a function of the transverse momentum of the @xmath2 boson .",
    "the cs polar angle analysis is more sensitive to the @xmath30 and @xmath25 angular coefficients ( see @xcite for a measurement of @xmath30 ) . because equation ( [ eq1 ] ) arises solely from quantum field theory , without input from any specific theoretical model of @xmath2 boson production , our experimental results are thus model - independent .",
    "the cdf detector is described in detail in @xcite . it is a general purpose detector of charged leptons , hadrons , jets , and photons , produced from proton - antiproton collisions at the tevatron accelerator at fermilab .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath40 bosons are detected through their decay leptons , while the transverse momentum of the neutrinos is estimated from the missing transverse energy of the events ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the @xmath17-axis of the detector coincides with the direction of the proton beam and defines the polar angle @xmath42 in the laboratory frame .",
    "the @xmath12-axis points vertically upward and the @xmath43-axis is in the horizontal plane , so as to form a right - handed coordinate system .",
    "the pseudorapidity , @xmath44 $ ] , and the azimuthal angle @xmath45 are used to specify detector physical areas .",
    "the tracking system of cdf consists of the silicon vertex detector ( svx ) , the vertex time projection chamber ( vtx ) and the central tracking chamber ( ctc ) , all immersed in a 1.4  t magnetic field produced by a superconducting solenoid of length 4.8 m and radius 1.5 m. the svx , a four layer silicon micro - strip vertex detector , is located immediately outside the beampipe .",
    "it is used to find secondary vertices and provides the impact parameter of tracks in the transverse @xmath46 plane .",
    "the vtx , located outside the svx , is a vertex time projection chamber that provides @xmath47 tracking information up to a radius of 22 cm and pseudorapidity @xmath48 .",
    "it measures the @xmath17-position of the primary vertex .",
    "finally , surrounding the svx and the vtx is the ctc , a 3.2 m long cylindrical drift chamber containing 84 layers of sense wires arranged in five superlayers of axial wires and four superlayers of stereo wires .",
    "the axial superlayers have 12 radially separated layers of sense wires , parallel to the @xmath17-axis , that measure the @xmath46 position of the tracks .",
    "the stereo superlayers have six layers of sense wires with alternate @xmath49 stereo angles with respect to the beamline , and measure a combination of @xmath46 and @xmath17 information .",
    "the stereo and axial data are combined to reconstruct the 3-dimensional track .",
    "the ctc covers the pseudorapidity interval @xmath50 and transverse momentum @xmath51 gev @xcite .",
    "the combined momentum resolution of the tracking system is @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the transverse momentum in gev .",
    "the solenoid is surrounded by sampling calorimeters used to measure the electromagnetic and hadronic energy of electrons , photons , and jets .",
    "the calorimeters cover the pseudorapidity range @xmath54 and the azimuthal angle range @xmath55 .",
    "they are segmented in @xmath56 towers pointing to the nominal interaction point at the center of the detector .",
    "the tower granularity is ( @xmath57 ) in the central region ( @xmath58 ) and ( @xmath59 ) in the plug ( @xmath60 ) and forward ( @xmath61 ) regions .",
    "each region has an electromagnetic calorimeter ( cem in the central region , pem in the plug region , and fem in the forward region ) followed by a hadron calorimeter at larger radius from the beam ( cha , pha , and fha respectively ) .",
    "the central calorimeters are segmented in 24 wedges per each half of the detector ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) .",
    "the cem is an 18 radiation length lead - scintillator stack with a position resolution of 2 mm and an energy resolution of @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the transverse energy in gev .",
    "located six radiation lengths deep inside the cem calorimeter ( 184 cm from the beamline ) , proportional wire chambers ( ces ) with additional cathode strip read - out provide shower position measurements in the @xmath17 and @xmath46 directions .",
    "the central hadron calorimeter ( cha ) is an iron - scintillator stack which is 4.5 interaction lengths thick and provides energy measurement with a resolution of @xmath66 , where @xmath65 is the transverse energy in gev .",
    "the central muon system consists of three components and is capable of detecting muons with transverse momentum @xmath67 gev and pseudorapidity @xmath50 .",
    "the central muon chambers ( cmu ) cover the region @xmath68 and consist of four layers of planar drift chambers outside the hadron calorimeter , allowing the reconstruction of the muons which typically pass the five absorption lengths of material . outside the cmu",
    "there are three additional absorption lengths of material ( 0.6 m of steel ) followed by four layers of drift chambers , the central muon upgrade ( cmp ) .",
    "the cmp chambers cover the same pseudorapidity region as the cmu , and they were introduced to limit the background caused from punch - through pions .",
    "finally , the central muon extension chambers ( cmx ) cover the region @xmath69 .",
    "these drift chambers are sandwiched between scintillators ( csx ) .",
    "depending on the incident angle , particles have to penetrate six to nine absorption lengths of material to be detected in the cmx . the particle candidate stub provided by the muon system",
    "is matched with a track from the ctc in order to successfully reconstruct a muon .",
    "cdf has a three - level trigger system designed to select events that can contain electrons , muons , jets , and @xmath41 .",
    "the first two levels are implemented in hardware , while the third is a software trigger which uses a version of the offline reconstruction software optimized for speed and implemented by a cpu farm .    at level-1",
    ", electrons were selected by the presence of an electromagnetic trigger tower with energy above 6 gev ( run ia ) or 8 gev ( run ib ) , where one trigger tower consisted of two adjacent physical towers ( in pseudorapidity ) .",
    "muons were selected by the presence of a track stub in the cmu or cmx , where there was also signal in the cmp .    at level-2 , electrons satisfied one of several triggers . in run ia , the event passed the trigger if the energy cluster in the cem was at least 9 gev with a seed tower of at least 7 gev , and a matching track with @xmath70 gev was found by the central fast tracker ( cft ) , the fast hardware processor that matched ctc tracks in the @xmath46 plane with signals in the calorimeters and muon chambers .",
    "it also passed the trigger if there was an isolated cluster in the cem calorimeter of at least 16 gev .",
    "the most common run ib level-2 electron trigger requires the existence of a cluster in the cem with at least 16 gev and the existence of a matching track in the cft with @xmath71 gev .",
    "the muon trigger at level-2 required a track of at least 9 gev ( run ia ) or 12 gev ( run ib ) that matched a cmx stub ( cmx triggers ) , both cmu and cmp stubs ( cmup triggers ) , or a cmu stub but no cmp stub ( cmnp triggers ) .    at level-3 , reconstruction programs performed 3-dimensional track reconstruction . in the run ia level-3 electron trigger , most of the accepted events passed the requirement that the cem cluster had @xmath72 gev , and was associated with a track of @xmath73 gev .",
    "the transverse energy of the cluster is defined as @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the total energy deposited in the cem , and @xmath13 is the polar angle measured from the event vertex to the centroid of the cluster .",
    "cuts were applied on the shape of the electron shower profile and the energy deposition patterns . in the run ib level-3 electron trigger , cem @xmath72 gev and cft @xmath73 gev requirements were applied .",
    "the muon trigger at level-3 required that the cft transverse momentum was greater than 18 gev , the energy deposited in the hadron calorimeter was less than 6 gev , the energy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter was less than 2 gev , and the extrapolated ctc track was no more than 2 centimeters away from the muon stub in the cmu chambers and 5 centimeters in the cmp or cmx chambers in the @xmath43 direction .",
    "events that pass the level-3 trigger were recorded to tape for offline analysis .",
