    "<S> @xcite requires a `` pre - existing '' @xmath88-channel flavour - singlet resonance at 1021 mev in order to reproduce the @xmath8 . in our model , </S>",
    "<S> such a low - lying @xmath88-channel contribution is not needed , only a regular bare @xmath89-wave @xmath34 spectrum from @xmath90 gev upwards . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath8 then appears spontaneously , though with a @xmath58 width which depends on the bare scalar mixing angle @xmath35 as well as the dynamical mixing with @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the model should also be contrasted with meson - exchange models ( see e.g.  the work of the jlich group , janssen _ </S>",
    "<S> et al .  _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , in which attraction is generated by a few @xmath91-channel meson exchanges , whereas in our approach it arises from the coupling to an infinity of bare @xmath88-channel @xmath6 states . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , light scalar mesons dynamically generated in the jlich model need not show up as a complete nonet . nevertheless , the two models share the feature that the stronger the couplings , albeit of different natures , the narrower the resonances ( see also below ) . most akin to our model </S>",

    "<S> _ _ _    a key point is that phase shifts rise more rapidly as the coupling constant @xmath26 increases . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the masses of the low - lying resonances move with @xmath26 , but their widths _ decrease _ as @xmath26 increases . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated for the 4 light scalars in table  [ table2 ] . _ _    </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , 3rd paper ) , while for small coupling they either disappear to @xmath92 in the complex energy plane or become virtual states . in this respect , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath8 and @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> behave in a completely different fashion to regular @xmath4 nonets , ( e.g. @xmath9 , @xmath93 , etc . ) </S>",

    "<S> is reproduced using closely similar @xmath26 parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> studying in more detail the trajectory of e.g.  the @xmath0 pole , we see how it emerges from the scattering continuum , passes the optimised position in table[table1 ] for @xmath95 gev@xmath75 , and then approaches the real axis . </S>",
    "<S> however , the pole clearly slows down for increasing coupling , and very large values of @xmath26 are needed to make @xmath0 a @xmath58 bound state . </S>",
    "<S> here we see the adler zero in action , whose influence increases as the pole moves to lower energies . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 pole behaves in a similar way , though it is more difficult to trace for small @xmath26 because of the @xmath96 adler zero at @xmath97 mev . </S>",
    "<S> descotes - genon and moussallam find a @xmath1 mass of @xmath98  mev and a width of @xmath99  mev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> their low mass does not fit well with what we find in table 2 . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that their calculation does not include dynamics of the strong coupling of @xmath100 to @xmath16 and consequent mixing between @xmath66 and @xmath1 . below the @xmath100 threshold , </S>",
    "<S> the analytic continuation of that channel definitely plays a role , as our calculation verifies . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath100 adler zero could affect details of their calculation , and their errors may therefore be too small .    </S>",
    "<S> the role of the adler zero is crucial in understanding @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the adler zero for @xmath2 prevents it from having a mass close to the @xmath101 threshold . </S>",
    "<S> this is why it settles close to the @xmath19 threshold , since that channel has only a distant adler zero . </S>",
    "<S> we have examined the pole structure of the @xmath101 amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting that , as well as having a narrow second sheet pole due to @xmath7 , there is a very broad pole at @xmath102 mev , resembling a bit the broad poles due to @xmath0 and @xmath1 ; this broad structure is too wide to determine experimentally .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to test the stability of the fits to data . of many such tests , </S>",
    "<S> one is to examine the stability of pole positions over the complete range of parameters shown in table  [ table1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the range of pole positions shown in table  [ table3 ] .    </S>",

    "<S> however , it is a different story for @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath26 is reduced to @xmath103 gev@xmath75 , the cusp at the @xmath19 threshold begins to soften , and at @xmath104 the pole breaks away from the @xmath19 threshold to become a virtual state at @xmath105 mev .    </S>",
    "<S> the pole position and line - shape of @xmath2 are likewise sensitive to @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> as it is decreased , the cusp at the @xmath19 threshold begins to soften for @xmath106 gev@xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 pole breaks away from the @xmath19 threshold and becomes a virtual state at about 1090 mev for @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the @xmath3 and @xmath2 are less tightly bound than @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> janssen _ </S>",
    "<S> et al .  _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have noted that @xmath7 appears as a virtual state in their calculation based on meson exchanges . </S>",
    "<S> _ _    the model is undoubtedly an over - simplification ; this is deliberate , so as to expose the essential features . </S>",
    "<S> however , these simplifications lead to difficulties with some details , which we now discuss . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , one of the major unknowns afflicting all spectroscopy is how to continue effects of inelastic channels below their thresholds , e.g.  in the processes @xmath108 and @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> this is relevant to details of both @xmath16 and @xmath58 phase shifts , particularly the former . </S>",
    "<S> the model predicts a large coupling of @xmath66 to @xmath96 , in agreement with lass data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it also predicts a similar large coupling of @xmath1 to @xmath96 ; this is because mesons couple via the @xmath4 loops of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the combined effect is to predict an even larger amplitude for @xmath109 than is fitted experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to attentuate this amplitude below the @xmath96 threshold , to avoid distorting the fit to the @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the model builds the @xmath16 adler zero into the amplitude for @xmath110 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the fit improves if we introduce an additional form factor @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the magnitude of the kaon momentum below the inelastic threshold in gev / c . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the fact that @xmath66 has a long tail of @xmath96 near its threshold . for consistency , the same suppression factor of subthreshold contributions </S>",
    "<S> is applied to the other scalars , too .    </S>",
    "<S> a further technicality is that , coupling only pp channels , too narrow a width is predicted for @xmath66 : @xmath113 mev , compared with @xmath114 mev quoted by the pdg @xcite . to avoid this conflict </S>",
    "<S> , we take the @xmath1 amplitude from the fit to experimental data in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and fit it only up to 1.2 gev , where the effect of @xmath66 in our model becomes negligible . </S>",
    "<S> preliminary results indicate that the inclusion of additional inelastic channels , such as vector - vector and scalar - scalar , may improve the widths of higher resonances </S>",
    "<S> . this will be the subject of future work .    </S>",
    "<S> next , the assumption of a sharp radius for the transition potential is an approximation ; this affects radial wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> thirdly , mesons outside the transition radius are treated as plane waves , but in reality they will be affected by @xmath91-channel meson exchanges , which for simplicity are absent in our approach .    </S>",
    "<S> we have fitted @xmath0 alone and @xmath8 alone , but also allowed both to couple simultaneously to @xmath58 , @xmath19 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> there is obvious mixing between @xmath0 and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath0 and @xmath8 are fitted together , the optimum fit gives a bare scalar mixing angle of @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> however , if @xmath8 is fitted alone with this mixing angle , the @xmath15 width comes out far too small , @xmath116 mev , compared with the observed full width at half maximum of @xmath117 mev . clearly , the additional dynamical mixing of @xmath8 with @xmath0 , mostly through intermediate @xmath19 , is crucial for a realistic description .    with the present sharp transition radius , </S>",
    "<S> it is difficult to fit simultaneously : ( i ) the elasticity parameter @xmath118 above 1 gev ; ( ii ) the intensity of @xmath119 from 1 to 1.2 gev ; ( iii ) @xmath15 phase shifts from 1 to 1.2 gev . any may be fitted alone , but the threefold combination exposes some conflicts . figure  [ fig3 ] shows two fits .     </S>",
    "<S> +     +    in ( a ) , we show the recent @xmath15 phases of kaminski , pelez and yndurain  @xcite above 1 gev . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig3](a ) and full lines on ( b ) and ( c ) show fits to individual sets of data , varying @xmath26 , @xmath25 and @xmath120 . </S>",
    "<S> this achieves a good fit to all sets of data . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig3](d ) and the dashed lines on figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](b ) and ( c ) show the best fit when all three sets of data are fitted simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> the pole position of @xmath8 is then at @xmath121 mev , compared with the experimental value @xmath122 from bes parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> the optimum value of @xmath35 is @xmath115 , quite a bit smaller than frequently quoted values ( see e.g.  ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , fitting @xmath8 alone gives rise to a much larger @xmath35 , in excess of @xmath123 . </S>",
    "<S> so there is a sizable , @xmath88-dependent dynamical contribution to the scalar mixing angle , which is largest in the vicinity of the @xmath8 , that is , near the @xmath19 threshold . </S>",
    "<S> this is a physically appealing result of our fits in this sector .    </S>",
    "<S> a further detail concerns the pseudoscalar mixing angle @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental value from crystal barrel is @xmath124 @xcite ; that is the value used here ( also see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . however , the fit to the line - shape of @xmath125 is sensitive to @xmath28 . for those data , </S>",
    "<S> the optimum value is @xmath126 . </S>",
    "<S> this value is used for fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) . with @xmath127 , </S>",
    "<S> the fit is 15% too high on both sides of the peak , as shown by the dotted curve . </S>",
    "<S> these discrepancies might be associated with the extensive @xmath19 cloud around @xmath7 or with the @xmath128 correlations proposed by jaffe . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , small yet non - negligible contributions from higher , closed thresholds may improve the predicted @xmath28 , as indicated by preliminary fits .    despite the blemishes described above </S>",
    "<S> , the essential results are as follows . </S>",
    "<S> the model of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] is capable of generating all of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 dynamically via the intermediate @xmath4 loop . </S>",
    "<S> this is a non - perturbative effect . </S>",
    "<S> the overall coupling constant required for the four resonances varies by only @xmath78 and the radius parameter @xmath25 by @xmath129 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , all scalar poles survive , with reasonable values , over the complete range of fitted parameters , so the model is very robust . </S>",
    "<S> the widths of these dynamical resonances decrease as the coupling constant increases . </S>",
    "<S> this is an essential difference from regular @xmath6 states , where , for not too large coupling , widths are roughly _ proportional _ to the square of the coupling . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the formation of these four resonances can not been dissociated from the presence of a bare @xmath6 spectrum , which is crucial for the generation of dynamical resonances with moderate widths . in particular , for each ground - state bare scalar @xmath6 state , a pair of resonances is produced by coupling to the meson - meson continuum , namely one light , non - standard scalar meson , and one regular scalar in the energy region 1.31.5 gev . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon was first observed two decades ago ( see 2nd paper of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , and later confirmed , to some extent , by trnqvist @xcite . _ _ </S>"
