    "in recent years , the energy , intensity and cosmic frontiers have come into focus as the three domains in which future discoveries in elementary particle physics are likely to arise . among the possibilities that might be revealed at the intensity frontier are  dark sectors \"  @xcite , with particles much lighter than the electroweak scale that have remained undetected due to their very weak interactions with standard model particles .",
    "the gravitational effects of dark matter is indirect evidence that at least one dark particle exists .",
    "the possibility that dark matter may also couple to spontaneously broken dark gauge forces has been motivated by the observation that sub - gev dark gauge boson decays could explain the electron and positron excesses observed in the cosmic ray spectra  @xcite .",
    "more generally , sectors that are only weakly coupled to the standard model arise quite generically in string theory  @xcite , so that investigations of other possible dark sectors  @xcite continue to be well motivated .",
    "given that the particle content and gauge structure of a generic dark sector is not well constrained , the largest number of analyses have assumed the simplest construction , a dark u(1 ) gauge field that has a small kinetic mixing with hypercharge  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it has been pointed out that a discrepancy between the observed value of the muon anomalous magnetic moment and the expectation of the standard model can be explained in this scenario  @xcite .",
    "however , the region of the mass - kinetic mixing plane in which this result can be achieved is very rapidly being excluded by bounds from dark photon searches  @xcite , in particular , the most recent results from the mainz microtron experiment  @xcite .",
    "dominant kinetic mixing will always assure that a dark photon couples identically to electrons and muons , so there is no way to escape this bound .",
    "the possibility that dark forces might couple differently to muons than electrons has been discussed in a somewhat different context , _",
    "i.e. _ , the proton charge radius problem , in ref .",
    "@xcite , but from an effective field theory perspective . here",
    "we will present a complete theory in which such a possibility is naturally realized .    although an explanation of the muon anomalous magnetic moment discrepancy is certainly worthwhile , it is arguably more important that the present work shows , in a complete theory , how a dark sector can naturally couple both weakly and preferentially to charged leptons of the second or third generation",
    ". this may provide motivation for a more intensive phenomenological consideration of processes involving muons and taus as a means of discerning couplings to new dark sector particles .",
    "the basic structure of the model is this : the dark gauge and higgs particles couple directly to a vector - like charged lepton that has gauge quantum numbers that allow mixing with the right - handed electron , muon or tau .",
    "however , the lepton sector is also constrained by a discrete , @xmath0 flavor symmetry that is the origin of neutrino tribimaximal mixing .",
    "this symmetry leads to preferential mixing between the vector - like state and only one standard model lepton flavor , while simultaneously keeping lepton - flavor - violating effects suppressed .",
    "the couplings between the standard model and the dark sector particles are naturally small since they are proportional to a small mixing angle that is set by the ratio of the dark to vector - like mass scales .",
    "lepton - flavor - universal couplings due to kinetic mixing with hypercharge are loop suppressed , since the dark sector gauge group in the proposed model is non - abelian .",
    "our letter is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the basic structure of the theory and show that the muon anomalous magnetic moment discrepancy can be resolved . in sec .",

    "the gauge group of the model is @xmath1su(@xmath2)@xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the standard model ( sm ) gauge group and the additional factor represents the gauge group of the dark sector .",
    "since the dark gauge group is non - abelian , kinetic mixing with hypercharge does not appear immediately through a renormalizable term in the lagrangian .",
    "we assume the existence of a vector - like doublet @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an su(@xmath2)@xmath3 index .",
    "these fields have the same @xmath4 quantum numbers as a right - handed electron , muon or tau .",
    "note that the theory is free of anomalies , since the new fermions come in a vector - like pair . since the @xmath7 fields carry both sm and dark quantum numbers , they serve as a portal between the sm and dark sectors .",
    "we assume that the dark gauge symmetry is completely broken by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a complex scalar doublet @xmath8 , @xmath9 a renormalizable coupling between @xmath10 and the sm higgs field @xmath11 , namely @xmath12 , can serve as another portal between the sm and dark sectors .",
    "however , to simplify the model parameter space in the present analysis , we will only consider the case in which this coupling is negligibly small .",
    "this limit is consistent with lhc data on the recently discovered @xmath13  gev boson which ( perhaps aside from the decay rate to two photons ) shows no substantial deviations from the expectations for a standard model higgs boson .",
    "mass mixing between the @xmath7 and sm lepton fields can occur when the su(@xmath2)@xmath3 gauge symmetry is broken .",
    "this mixing will induce a coupling between the dark gauge boson multiplet and ordinary sm leptons that is suppressed by a small mixing angle , one proportional to @xmath14 , where @xmath15  gev is the electroweak scale . like most dark photon models",
    ", we will typically assume that the dark gauge bosons have masses less than @xmath16  gev .",

    "similar conclusions can be drawn from other possible lepton - flavor - violating processes , which we will not consider in explicit detail here .",
    "before concluding , we comment on a few of the other potential bounds on the model .",
    "it has been noted  @xcite in the context of other models  @xcite in which a right - handed muon couples to a new gauge field @xmath147 that the effective coupling @xmath148 is bounded by the absence of missing mass events in the leptonic kaon decay @xmath149 . in the present model ,",

    "@xcite ; the limit is always larger than @xmath155 .",
    "hence , the model parameter space is not severely constrained based on this consideration .",
    "the bounds on the dark sector states from accelerator experiments  @xcite depend on how these states decay , and their are many possible scenarios .",
    "here we discuss one interesting case that corresponds to the largest parameter region shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pspace ] : if @xmath156 , the dark gauge fields will decay only to electrons via loop - suppressed kinetic mixing and we can compare to the bounds from dark photon searches .",

    "of course , the dark sector could include dark matter candidates into which the the dark gauge and higgs fields decay . in this case , dark photon searches at accelerators would present no further bounds on the model .",
    "in this letter , we have shown how one can construct a dark sector that couples preferentially to a single flavor of standard model charged leptons , without generating large lepton - flavor - violating effects . the dark gauge and higgs bosons couple to @xmath177  gev vector - like fermions that have the correct gauge quantum numbers to mix with either the right - handed electron , muon or tau .",
    "however , the lepton sector is also constrained by an @xmath0 flavor symmetry that is the origin of neutrino tribimaximal mixing .",
    "this symmetry assures that the vector - like state mixes with only one flavor of charged lepton while the charged lepton yukawa matrix remains very accurately diagonal .",
    "deviations from this flavor structure are related to the ratio of the right - handed neutrino mass scale to the cut off of the effective theory , and can be made adequately small .",
    "moreover , lepton - flavor - universal couplings via kinetic mixing are loop suppressed since the dark sector gauge group is non - abelian .",
    "if the vector - like states mix with leptons of the second generation ( which has been the assumption in this letter ) contributions from the non - standard - model particles can account for the current deviation of the muon anomalous magnetic moment from the standard model expectation .",
    "more importantly , however , the construction described in this letter can be used to create ultraviolet complete theories ( at least up to the high scale at which flavor is generated ) in which dark sector gauge bosons couple preferentially to either muons or taus .",
    "this provides motivation for exploring a vast realm of phenomenological processes involving second and third generation leptons as another possible window on a dark sector .        for a review ,",
