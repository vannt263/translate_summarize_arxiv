    "the possible existence of a new class of compact stars , which are made entirely of deconfined _ u , d , s _ quark matter ( _ strange quark matter _ ( sqm ) ) , is one of the most intriguing aspects of modern astrophysics .",
    "these compact objects are called strange stars .",
    "they differ from neutron stars , where quarks are confined within neutrons , protons , and eventually within other hadrons ( _ e.g .",
    "hyperons _ ) .",
    "the investigation of such a possibility is relevant not only for astrophysics , but for high energy physics too .",
    "in fact , the search for a deconfined phase of quark matter is one of the main goals in heavy ion physics .",
    "experiments at brookhaven national lab s relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and at cern s large hadron collider ( lhc ) , will hopefully clarify this issue in the near future .",
    "the possibility that strange stars do exist is based on the so called _ strange matter hypothesis _ , formulated by witten  ( 1984 ) ( see also bodmer , 1971 ) . according to this hypothesis , strange quark matter , in equilibrium with respect to the weak interactions ,",
    "could be the true ground state of strongly interacting matter rather than @xmath0 , _",
    "i.e. _ the energy per baryon of sqm must fulfil the inequality ( e ) _ sqm 930  mev , [ eq : stablesqm ] at the baryon density where the pressure is equal to zero .",
    "if the strange matter hypothesis is true , then a nucleus with a nucleons , could in principle lower its energy by converting to a strangelet ( a drop of sqm ) .",
    "however , this process requires a very high - order simultaneous weak interactions to convert about a number a of _ u _ and _ d _ quarks of the nucleus into strange quarks .",
    "the probability for such a process is extremely low , being @xmath1 the fermi constant , and assuming a number @xmath2 of simultaneous weak processes . ] , and the mean life time for an atomic nucleus to decay to a strangelet is much higher than the age of the universe . on the other hand ,",
    "a step by step production of _ s _ quarks , at different times , will produce hyperons in the nucleus , _",
    "i.e. _ a system ( hypernucleus ) with a higher energy per baryon with respect to the original nucleus .",
    "in addition , finite size effects ( surface and shell effects ) place a lower limit ( a @xmath3 10100 ) on the baryon number of a stable strangelet even if bulk sqm is stable ( farhi & jaffe , 1984 ) .",
    "thus , according to the strange matter hypothesis , the ordinary state of matter , in which quarks are confined within hadrons , is a metastable state .",
    "the success of traditional nuclear physics , in explaining an astonishing amount of experimental data , provides a clear indication that quarks in a nucleus are confined within protons and neutrons .",
    "thus , the energy per baryon @xmath4 of _ u , d _ quark matter ( nonstrange quark matter ) must be higher than the energy per baryon of nuclei ( e ) _ ud 930  mev + , [ eq : stablensqm ] being @xmath5  mev a quantity which accounts for the lower energy per baryon of a finite chunk ( @xmath6 ) of nonstrange quark matter with respect to the bulk ( @xmath7 ) case ( farhi & jaffe , 1984 ) . these stability conditions ( eq.s ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ) in turn may be used to constrain the parameters entering in models for the equation of state ( eos ) of sqm . as we show below",
    ", the existence of strange stars is allowable within the uncertainties inherent in perturbative quantum chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "thus _ strange stars may exist in the universe_.",
    "from a basic point of view the equation of state for sqm should be calculated solving the equations of qcd . as we know",
    ", such a fundamental approach is presently not doable .",
    "therefore one has to rely on phenomenological models . in this work ,",
    "we discuss two phenomenological models for the eos of strange quark matter .",
    "the first one is a well known model related to the mit bag model ( chodos  1974 ) for hadrons .",
    "the second one is a new model developed by dey  ( 1998 ) . at very high density sqm behaves as a relativistic gas of weakly interacting fermions .",
    "this is a consequence of one of the basic features of qcd , namely asymptotic freedom . to begin with",
    "consider the case of massless quarks , and consider gluon exchange interactions to the first order in the qcd structure constant @xmath8 . under these circumstances",
    "the eos of @xmath9stable sqm can be written in the parametrical form : = k n_b^4/3 + b , p = 1 k n_b^4/3 - b ,   k ^2/3 ( 1 + 2_c ) c [ eq : eosb1 ] @xmath10 being the energy density , and @xmath11 the pressure . eliminating the baryon number density @xmath12 one gets : p = 1 ( - 4 b ) [ eq : eosbag ] here @xmath13 is a phenomenological parameter which represents the difference between the energy density of `` perturbative vacuum '' and true qcd vacuum .",
    "@xmath13 is related to the `` bag constant '' which in the mit bag model for hadrons ( chodos  1974 ) gives the confinement of quarks within the hadronic bag .",
    "the density of zero pressure sqm is just @xmath14 .",
    "this is the value of the surface density of a bare strange star .",
    "taking a non - vanishing value for the mass @xmath15 of the strange quark , the eos becomes more involved ( see _ e.g. _ farhi & jaffe , 1984 ) with respect to the simple expression ( 4 ) .",
    "however , for @xmath16300  mev , equation ( 4 ) is less than 5% different from the `` exact '' case for @xmath17 . in summary , in this model for the equation of state for sqm there are three phenomenological parameters , namely : @xmath13 , @xmath15 , and @xmath8 .",
    "it is possible to determine ranges in the values of these parameters in which sqm is stable , and nonstrange quark matter is not ( farhi & jaffe , 1984 ) .",
    "for example , in the case of non  interacting quarks ( @xmath18 ) one has @xmath19",
    "5791  mev/@xmath20 for @xmath21 , and @xmath19 5775  mev/@xmath20 for @xmath22  mev .",
    "the schematic model outlined above becomes less and less trustworthy going from very high density region ( asymptotic freedom regime ) to lower densities , where confinement ( hadrons formation ) takes place .",
    "recently , dey _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) derived a new eos for sqm using a `` dynamical '' density - dependent approach to confinement .",
    "the eos by dey _",
    "_ has asymptotic freedom built in , shows confinement at zero baryon density , deconfinement at high density . in this model ,",
    "the quark interaction is described by a colour - debye - screened inter - quark vector potential originating from gluon exchange , and by a density - dependent scalar potential which restores chiral symmetry at high density ( in the limit of massless quarks ) .",
    "the density - dependent scalar potential arises from the density dependence of the in - medium effective quark masses @xmath23 , which , in the model by dey ( 1998 ) , are taken to depend upon the baryon number density according to m_q = m_q + 310 sech ( ) ( mev ) , where @xmath24  @xmath25 is the normal nuclear matter density , @xmath26 is the flavor index , and @xmath27 is a parameter .",
    "the effective quark mass @xmath28 goes from its constituent masses at zero density , to its current mass @xmath29 , as @xmath12 goes to infinity .",
    "here we consider two different parameterizations of the eos by dey _",
    "_ , which correspond to a different choice for the parameter @xmath27 .",
    "the equation of state ss1 ( ss2 ) corresponds to @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "these two models for the eos give absolutely stable sqm according to the strange matter hypothesis .",
    "to distinguish whether a compact star is a neutron star or a strange star , one has to find a clear observational signature .",
    "there is a striking qualitative difference in the mass  radius ( mr ) relation of strange stars with respect to that of neutron stars ( see fig .  1 ) . for strange stars with `` small '' ( @xmath32 ) gravitational mass ,",
    "@xmath33 is proportional to @xmath34 .",
    "in contrast , neutron stars have radii that decrease with increasing mass .",
    "this is a consequence of the underlying interaction between the stellar constituents which makes `` low '' mass strange stars self - bound objects ( see _ e.g. _ bombaci 1999 ) contrary to the case of neutron stars which are bound by gravity . as we know , there is a minimum mass for a neutron star ( @xmath35 ) . in the case of a strange star ,",
    "there is essentially no minimum mass . as the central density @xmath36 ( surface density ) , a strange star ( or better a strangelet for very low baryon number ) is a self  bound system , until the baryon number becomes so low that finite size effects destabilize it .",
    "the transient x - ray burst source  was discovered in september 1996 by the bepposax satellite .",
    "two bright type - i x - ray bursts were detected , each lasting less than 30 seconds .",
    "analysis of the bursts in  indicates that it is 4  kpc distant and has a peak x - ray luminosity of @xmath37erg / s in its bright state , and a x - ray luminosity lower than @xmath38erg / s in quiescence ( int zand 1998 ) .",
    "the object is nearly certainly the same as the transient x - ray source detected with the proportional counter array ( pca ) on board the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) ( marshall , 1998 ) .",
    "coherent pulsations at a period of 2.49 milliseconds were discovered ( wijnands & van der klis 1998 ) .",
    "the star s surface dipolar magnetic moment was derived to be less than @xmath39  g  @xmath40 from detection of x - ray pulsations at a luminosity of @xmath41  erg / s ( wijnands & van der klis 1998 ) , consistent with the weak fields expected for type - i x - ray bursters and millisecond radio pulsars ( ms psrs ) ( bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 ) . the binary nature of  was firmly established with the detection of a 2 hour orbital period ( chakrabarty & morgan 1998 ) as well as with the optical identification of the companion star ( roche  1998 ) .  is the first pulsar to show both coherent pulsations in its persistent emission and x - ray bursts , and by far the fastest - rotating , lowest - field accretion - driven pulsar known .",
    "it presents direct evidence for the evolutionary link between low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) and ms psrs .",
    "is the only known lmxb with an ms psr .",
    "a mass  radius ( mr ) relation for the compact star in   has been recently obtained by li  ( 1999a )   using the following two requirements .",
    "( _ i _ ) detection of x - ray pulsations requires that the inner radius @xmath42 of the accretion flow should be larger than the stellar radius @xmath43 . in other words ,",
    "the stellar magnetic field must be strong enough to disrupt the disk flow above the stellar surface .",
    "( _ ii _ ) the radius @xmath42 must be less than the so - called co - rotation radius @xmath44 , _ i.e. _ the stellar magnetic field must be weak enough that accretion is not centrifugally inhibited : = [ gm p^2/(4 ^ 2)]^1/3 . here",
    "@xmath45 is the gravitation constant , @xmath33 is the mass of the star , and @xmath11 is the pulse period . the inner disk radius @xmath42 is generally evaluated in terms of the alfvn radius @xmath46 , at which the magnetic and material stresses balance ( bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 ) : @xmath47^{2/7}$ ] , where @xmath13 and @xmath48 are respectively the surface magnetic field and the mass accretion rate of the pulsar , and @xmath49 is a parameter of order of unity almost independent of @xmath48 ( li 1997 , burderi & king 1998 ) . since x - ray pulsations in  were detected over a wide range of mass accretion rate ( say , from @xmath50 to @xmath51 ) , the two conditions ( _ i _ ) and ( _ ii _ ) give @xmath52 .",
    "next , we assume that the mass accretion rate @xmath48 is proportional to the x - ray flux @xmath53 observed with rxte .",
    "this is guaranteed by the fact that the x - ray spectrum of  was remarkably stable and there was only slight increase in the pulse amplitude when the x - ray luminosity varied by a factor of @xmath54 during the 1998 april / may outburst ( gilfanov  1998 , cui  1998 , psaltis & chakrabarty 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , li  ( 1999a ) get the following upper limit of the stellar radius : @xmath55 , or r < 27.5 ( f_min)^2/7 ( p)^2/3 ( m)^1/3  km , [ eq : mr - sax ] where @xmath56 and @xmath57 denote the x - ray fluxes measured during x - ray high- and low - state , respectively , @xmath58 is the solar mass .",
    "note that in writing inequality ( 7 ) it is assumed that the pulsar s magnetic field is basically dipolar ( see li  1999a for arguments to support this hypothesis ) .",
    "given the range of x - ray flux at which coherent pulsations were detected , inequality ( 7 ) defines a limiting curve in the mass  radius plane for sax j1808.4 - 3658 , as plotted in the dashed curve in fig .  1 .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "( li  1999a ) adopted the flux ratio @xmath59 from the observations that during the 1998 april / may outburst , the maximum @xmath60 kev flux of  at the peak of the outburst was @xmath61 , while the pulse signal became barely detectable when the flux dropped below @xmath62 ( cui  1998 , psaltis & chakrabarty 1999 ) .",
    "the dashed line @xmath63 represents the schwartzschild radius - the lower limit of the stellar radius to prevent the star collapsing into a black hole .",
    "thus the allowed range of the mass and radius of  is the region confined by these two dashed curves in fig .  1 .    in the same figure , we report the theoretical mr relations ( solid curves ) for neutron stars given by some recent realistic models for the eos of dense matter ( see li  1999a for references to the eos models ) .",
    "models bbb1 and bbb2 are relative to `` conventional '' neutron stars ( _ i.e _ the core of the star is assumed to be composed by an uncharged mixture of neutrons , protons , electrons and muons in equilibrium with respect to the weak interaction ) .",
    "the curve labeled hyp depicts the mr relation for a neutron star in which hyperons are considered in addition to nucleons as hadronic constituents .",
    "the mr curve labeled @xmath64 is relative to neutron stars with a bose - einstein condensate of negative kaons in their cores .",
    "it is clearly seen in fig .  1 that none of the neutron star mr curves is consistent with . including rotational effects",
    "will shift the @xmath65 curves to up - right in fig .  1 ( datta  1998 ) , and does not help improve the consistency between the theoretical neutron star models and observations of",
    ". therefore  is not well described by a neutron star model .",
    "the curve b90 in fig .",
    "1 gives the mr relation for strange stars described by the schematic eos ( 4 ) with b = 90 mev/@xmath20 .",
    "the two curves ss1 and ss2 give the mr relation for strange stars calculated with the eos by dey et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . figure  1 clearly demonstrates that a strange star model is more compatible with  than a neutron star one .",
    "recently , li et al .",
    "( 1999b ) investigated possible signatures for the existence of strange stars in connection with the newly discovered phenomenon of kilohertz quasi ",
    "periodic oscillations ( khz qpos ) in the x - ray flux from lmxb ( for a review see van der klis 2000 ) .",
    "initially , khz qpo data from various sources were interpreted assuming a simple _ beat  frequency model _",
    "( see _ e.g. _ kaaret & ford 1997 ) .",
    "in many cases , two simultaneous khz qpo peaks ( `` twin peaks '' ) are observed .",
    "the qpo frequencies vary and are strongly correlated with source flux . in the beat  frequency model the highest observed qpo frequency @xmath66 is interpreted as the keplerian orbital frequency @xmath67 at the inner edge of the accretion disk .",
    "the frequency @xmath68 of the lower qpo peak is instead interpreted as the beat frequency between @xmath67 and the neutron star spin frequency @xmath69 , which within this model is equal to the separation frequency @xmath70 of the two peaks .",
    "thus @xmath71 is predicted to be constant .",
    "nevertheless , novel observations for different khz qpo sources have challenged this simple beat  frequency model .",
    "the most striking case is the source 4u 1728 - 34 , where it was found that @xmath71 decreases significantly , from @xmath72 hz to @xmath73 hz , as the frequency of the lower khz qpo increases ( mndez & van der klis 1999 ) .",
    "furthermore , in the spectra observed by the rxte for 4u 1728 - 34 , ford & van der klis ( 1998 ) found low - frequency lorentian oscillations with frequencies between 10 and 50 hz .",
    "these frequencies as well as the break frequency ( @xmath74 ) of the power spectrum density for the same source were shown to be correlated with @xmath66 and @xmath68 .    a different model was recently developed by osherovich & titarchuk ( 1999 ) ( see also titarchuk & osherovich 1999 ) , who proposed a unified classification of khz qpos and the related observed low frequency phenomena . in this model , khz qpos",
    "are modeled as keplerian oscillations under the influence of the coriolis force in a rotating frame of reference ( magnetosphere ) .",
    "the frequency @xmath68 of the lower khz qpo peak is the keplerian frequency at the outer edge of a viscous transition layer between the keplerian disk and the surface of the compact star .",
    "the frequency @xmath66 is a hybrid frequency related to the rotational frequency @xmath75 of the star s magnetosphere by : @xmath76 . the observed low lorentzian frequency in 4u 1728 - 34",
    "is suggested to be associated with radial oscillations in the viscous transition layer of the disk , whereas the observed break frequency is determined by the characteristic diffusion time of the inward motion of the matter in the accretion flow ( titarchuk & osherovich 1999 ) .",
    "predictions of this model regarding relations between the qpo frequencies mentioned above compare favorably with recent observations for 4u 1728 - 34 , sco x-1 , 4u 1608 - 52 , and 4u 1702 - 429 .    the presence of the break frequency and the correlated lorentzian frequency suggests the introduction of a new scale in the phenomenon .",
    "one attractive feature of the model by titarchuk & osherovich ( 1999 ) is the introduction of such a scale in the model through the reynolds number for the accretion flow .",
    "the best fit for the observed data was obtained by titarchuk & osherovich ( 1999 ) when @xmath77 where @xmath33 is the stellar mass , @xmath42 is the inner edge of the accretion disk   reported in titarchuk & osherovich ( 1999 ) , one has @xmath78 , where @xmath42 is erroneously indicated as the neutron star radius ( titarchuk , private communication ) . ] , @xmath79 is the schwarzschild radius , and @xmath69 is the spin frequency of the star .",
    "given the 364 hz spin frequency of 4u 1728 - 34 ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 ) , the inner disk radius can be derived from the previous equation .",
    "since the innermost radius of the disk must be larger than the radius @xmath43 of the star itself , this leads to a mass - dependent upper bound on the stellar radius , @xmath80 which is plotted by dashed curve in fig .  2 .    a second constraint on the mass and radius of 4u 1728 - 34 results from the requirement that the inner radius @xmath42 of the disk must be larger than the radius of the last stable circular orbit @xmath81 around the star :",
    "to make our discussion more transparent , neglect for a moment the rotation of the compact star . for a non - rotating star @xmath82 , then the second condition gives : 3 = 8.86   ( m / m _ )  km .",
    "therefore , the allowed range of the mass and radius for 4u1728 - 34 is the region in the lower left corner of the mr plane confined by the dashed curve ( @xmath83 ) , by the horizontal dashed line , and by the schwartzschild radius ( dashed line @xmath84 ) . in the same figure",
    ", we compare with the theoretical mr relations for non - rotating neutron stars and strange stars , for the same models for the eos considered in fig .",
    "it is clear that a strange star model is more compatible with 4u 1728 - 34 than a neutron star one .",
    "including the effects of rotation ( @xmath85364 hz ) in the calculation of the theoretical mr relations and @xmath81 , does not change the previous conclusion ( li  1999b ) .",
    "the main result of the present work ( _ i.e. _ the likely existence of strange stars ) is based on the analysis of observational data for the x - ray sources sax j1808.4 - 3658 and 4u  1728 - 34 .",
    "the interpretation of these data is done using _ standard _",
    "models for the accretion mechanism , which is responsible for the observed phenomena .",
    "the present uncertainties in our knowledge of the accretion mechanism , and the disk  magnetosphere interaction , do not allow us to definitely rule out the possibility of a neutron star for the two x - ray sources we discussed .",
    "for example , making _ a priori _ the _ conservative _ assumption that the compact object in  is a neutron star , and using a mr relation similar to our eq .",
    "( 7 ) psaltis & chakrabarty ( 1999 ) try to constrain disk ",
    "magnetosphere interaction models or to infer the presence of a quadrupole magnetic moment in the compact star .    and",
    "4u  1728 - 34 are not the only lmxbs which could harbour a strange star .",
    "recent studies have shown that the compact objects associated with the x - ray burster 4u 1820 - 30 ( bombaci 1997 ) , the bursting x - ray pulsar gro j1744 - 28 ( cheng  1998b ) and the x - ray pulsar her x-1 ( dey  1998 ) are likely strange star candidates .",
    "for each of these x - ray sources ( strange star candidates ) the conservative assumption of a neutron star as the central accretor would require some particular ( possibly _ ad hoc _ ) assumption about the nature of the plasma accretion flow and/or the structure of the stellar magnetic field . on the other hand",
    ", the possibility of a strange star gives a simple and unifying picture for all the systems mentioned above .",
    "finally , strange stars have also been speculated to model @xmath86-ray bursters ( haensel  1991 , bombaci & datta 2000 ) and soft @xmath86-ray repeaters ( cheng & dai 1998a ) .    0.6 cm 0.2 cm i thank my colleagues j. dey , m. dey , e.p.j .",
