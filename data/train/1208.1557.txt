    "the whole system evolves such that another qubit ends up in the state @xmath0 .",
    "this method does not require the qubit couplings to be switched on and off .",
    "therefore , it is suitable to implement in solid - state quantum systems @xcite .",

    "the pure state of qubits @xmath41 and @xmath70 is the maximally entangled bell state which is very useful in other tasks of quantum information processing .",

    "the entanglement will be extinguished if the values @xmath78 . in association with the property of the charateristic time , it is found out that the time for the achievement of perfect quantum communication is very short in the condition of @xmath79 where the maximally entangled state can be generated and separated from the system .",
    "an arbitrary single - qubit quantum state is transferred through the quantum channel of anisotropic heisenberg three - spin chain with multiple spin exchangle interaction .",
