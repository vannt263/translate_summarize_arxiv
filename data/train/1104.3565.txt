    "coalescing systems of stellar mass binary black holes ( bbhs ) are among the most likely candidates for the first detection of gravitational waves ( gws ) @xcite .",
    "their enormous predicted luminosities @xmath7 , would allow future ground - based interferometric gw detectors , such as advanced ligo @xcite and advanced virgo @xcite or third generation instruments such as the einstein telescope ( et ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to probe these sources out to gpc distances . in this paper",
    ", we are motivated by recent increased rate estimates @xcite to explore the possibility that a population of bbhs could form a detectable stochastic gw background ( sgwb ) signal for these instruments .",
    "sgwbs can result from the superposition of populations of unresolved primordial @xcite or astrophysical sources ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) .",
    "astrophysical sgwb signals are important for at least two reasons .",
    "firstly , they contain rich information on the global properties of source populations , such as their source rate evolution , their mass ranges and their average energy emissions .",
    "secondly , a dominant continuous astrophysical background could mask the relic sgwb signal from the very early universe ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) .",
    "mergers of binary neutron stars have been suggested as sources of potentially detectable sgwbs @xcite .",
    "recent observations of bh - wolf - rayet ( wr ) star systems @xcite and new estimates in the metallicity abundances of star forming galaxies @xcite imply that the galactic merger rate of bbhs may be of a similar order to that of binary neutron stars @xcite .",
    "therefore , a population of more luminous bbhs could produce a dominant background signal .",
    "our aim is to explore upper limits for a sgwb from coalescing bbhs over a range of rates and system masses .",
    "we investigate the constraints future ground based interferometric gw detectors will be able to place on the average properties of the bbh population .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss rate estimates of coalescing bbhs and then derive cosmic source rate evolution models for different star formation histories and minimal delay times . in section 3 , source energy spectra for coalescing bbhs are obtained using the template gravitational waveforms of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we then calculate the bbh background in section 4 and discuss the detection regimes , detectability and constraints on the parameter space of the predicted background in section 5 .",
    "finally , in section 6 we present our conclusions .",
    "the discovery of bh - wr star systems within close proximity has increased rate estimates of coalescing bbhs .",
    "there are presently two known systems : ngc300 x-1 , which lies at a distance of 1.8 mpc and is composed of a @xmath8 bh and a wr star of @xmath9 @xcite ; ic10 x-1 contains a bh of a mass at least @xmath10 and a @xmath11 wr star , and lies within 700 kpc @xcite . as wr stars are the progenitors of type ib / c supernovae , if such systems survive the supernova explosion , bbh systems will form and eventually coalesce within a timescale of gyrs @xcite .",
    "recent results from sloan digital sky survey , have indicated that half of recent star formation involved galaxies with low metallicity @xcite .",
    "this has a profound effect on the coalescence rates of compact binaries containing bhs when one considers that ngc300 x-1 and ic10 x-1 were both formed in low metallicity environments .",
    "survival of bbh systems is highly dependent on whether they can overcome two key obstacles in their evolution .",
    "firstly , post natal supernova kicks can disrupt a significant proportion of systems . secondly , orbital shrinkage during the common envelope phase when the larger star transfers mass to its smaller companion , can cause the stars to merge before they become compact objects .",
    "@xcite have shown through population - synthesis modeling that a lower metallicity environment can suppress these two effects .",
    "firstly , observational evidence suggests that larger bh masses , which are produced at low metallicity , are born with lower kick velocities @xcite .",
    "secondly , in lower metallicity environments , slower radial expansion occurs during the common envelope phase , thus increasing binary retention .",
    "the greater fraction of systems that can survive , in combination with a greater detection range from more massive and hence luminous systems , has increased the detection prospects of bbhs for ground - based interferometric gw detectors @xcite .",
    "previous estimates of the coalescence rate of bbhs formed through isolated binary evolution in the field have ranged over orders of magnitude , from @xmath12 to 0.3 mpc@xmath13 with a realistic value of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the effect of metallicity discussed above increases the realistic estimate to @xmath15 assuming a 50 - 50 mixture of solar and @xmath16 solar metallicity and the most stringent evolutionary scenario with respect to system survival @xcite .",
    "unless we state otherwise , this rate ( denoted as @xmath17 ) is adopted in our calculations .    a higher estimate of @xmath18 ( denoted as @xmath19 ) was obtained by assuming that all systems survive early merger during the common envelope stage .",
    "we note that @xmath19 leads to a detection rate for initial ligo / virgo of around 5 events per year .",
    "a recent population synthesis study by @xcite , however , has demonstrated the formation of bbhs with high chirp masses ( @xmath20 ) from the two bh - wr systems , and has yielded a similarly high rate of @xmath21 corresponding to 3.6 detections a year .",
    "they suggest that either currently employed searches are insensitive to higher mass bbh inspirals or that there is an additional aspect to the evolution of such systems that has not so far been considered . to take account of this uncertainty , we take @xmath19 as a higher rate .      the cosmic coalescence rate can be extrapolated from the local rate density @xmath22 by assuming the rate tracks the star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "explicitly , the differential gw event rate in the redshift shell @xmath23 to @xmath24 can be written as @xmath25    with @xmath26 the cosmology dependent co - moving volume element given by    @xmath27    where the hubble parameter @xmath28^{1/2}$ ] and @xmath29 is the comoving distance related to the luminosity distance by @xmath30 .",
    "we use the parameters @xmath31 with @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "source rate density evolution is accounted for by the dimensionless evolution factor @xmath35 , normalized to unity in our local intergalactic neighbourhood .",
    "following @xcite , we define @xmath36 normalized to unity at @xmath37 where @xmath38    relates the sfr to the bbh coalescence rate . here , @xmath39 is the sfr density in @xmath40 , based on the parametric form of @xcite , derived from recent measurements of the galaxy luminosity function . to allow for uncertainties in the sfr",
    ", we also consider a recent model described in @xcite , obtained through measurements of the stellar mass density  this model gives a much lower rate for @xmath41 .",
    "the factors @xmath23 and @xmath42 represent the redshift values of bbhs merger and bbh system formation respectively . the delay time for bbhs , @xmath43 ,",
    "is given by the difference in lookback times between @xmath42 and @xmath23    @xmath44    here @xmath45 is the probability distribution of delay times .",
    "for this we take the form , @xmath46 , with a lower cutoff @xmath47 at 100 myr as suggested by current population synthesis studies @xcite . to account for uncertainty in the lower cutoff and possible correlation between @xmath45 and bbh chirp masses ,",
    "we additionally consider a longer minimal delay time of @xmath48 myr ( t. bulik , private communication ) .",
    "figure 1 . shows the cosmic rate evolution factor @xmath35 of bbh coalescences for different sfrs and minimal delay times .",
    "although the models show some variation in peak @xmath23 , we show in section 4 that the magnitude of the background is largely dependent on @xmath22 rather than the form of @xmath35 .",
    "the evolution of a coalescing bbh is traditionally divided into three phases : _ inspiral _ , _ merger _ and _ ringdown_. while the early inspiral and ringdown phases can be approximated analytically by post - newtonian expansion and perturbation theory , to model the late inspiral and merger requires a numerical solution of the einstein equations . in the last few years breakthroughs in numerical relativity have enabled the inspiral - merger - ringdown evolution of bbh coalescences to be modeled with high accuracy for a broad space of parameters ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) .    for the complete evolution history of coalescing bbhs ,",
    "phenomenological waveforms can be constructed by frequency domain matching of post - newtonian inspiral waveforms with coalescence waveforms from numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "such waveforms share a common feature , in that the fourier amplitude is approximated to a leading order as a power - law function of frequency @xmath49 for the inspiral phase , followed by @xmath50 for the merger stage and a lorentzian function around the quasi - normal mode ringdown frequency for the ringdown stage .    for this study , we convert to a energy spectrum to account for the individual source emissions .",
    "we choose two template models : one from @xcite , for a non - spinning case , and another from @xcite for bbhs with non - precessing spins . in @xcite",
    "the fourier amplitude is given by their equation ( 4.13 ) , which we convert to an energy spectrum @xmath51 . as we expect the inspiral spectrum to equal the post - newtonian approximation ( see , e.g. ,",

    "the set of parameters ( @xmath61 ) can be determined by the two physical parameters ( the total mass @xmath62 and the symmetric mass ratio @xmath63 ) in terms of @xmath64 , with coefficients @xmath65 given in table 1 of @xcite , producing ( 404 , 807 , 237 , 1153)hz for a @xmath66 bbh ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the waveform presented in @xcite , includes spin effects through a single spin parameter @xmath68 , with @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the parameter @xmath71 represents the spin angular momentum of the @xmath72th black hole .",
    "the corresponding fourier amplitude includes a minor correction ( related to @xmath73 and @xmath63 ) for non - spinning bbhs .",
    "we construct energy spectra for bbhs with non - precessing spins based on their    figure 2 shows the gw energy spectra for a @xmath74 bbh assuming : the non - spinning case ; @xmath75 ; @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the two extreme values for @xmath73 are set by the numerical simulations of @xcite , corresponding to both binary components having maximal spins aligned or anti - aligned with the orbital angular momentum .",
    "the radiation efficiencies for these energy spectra are @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively .",
    "we note that the radiated gw energy mainly depends on @xmath55 and @xmath73 , and that the energy spectra for @xmath82 100 hz show little variation .",
    "we note that effect of orbital eccentricity is not considered in our derivation of energy spectrum .",
    "this has little effect on our results as the orbits of coalescing compact objects are expected to circularise @xcite before their gw signals reach the sensitive frequency band of ground - based interferometric detectors @xcite .",
    "in this section we evaluate the spectral properties of the bbh background .",
    "it is customary to characterize the sgwb by the energy density parameter    @xmath83    where @xmath84 is the gw energy density , @xmath85 is the observed gw frequency and @xmath86 is the present value of critical energy density required to close the universe . for a sgwb of astrophysical origin",
    ", @xmath87 is related to the spectral energy density @xmath88 ( in @xmath89 ) by    @xmath90    where @xmath88 at the observed frequency @xmath85 can be written as    @xmath91    here , @xmath92 , with @xmath93 the maximum redshift of sfr model and @xmath94 the maximal emitting gw frequency .",
    "the differential gw event rate , @xmath95 , is given by equation ( 1 ) and @xmath96 is the energy flux per unit frequency emitted by a source at a luminosity distance @xmath97    @xmath98    where @xmath99 is the gravitational energy spectrum given by equation ( 5 ) and @xmath100 is the frequency in the source frame which is related to the observed frequency by @xmath101 .",
    "figure 3 shows the energy density parameter @xmath87 of the bbh background corresponding to five models outlined in table 1 .",
    "the final model ( e ) approximates the common power - law behavior of models ( a - d ) before reaching a peak of @xmath102 at 400 - 600 hz , and uses a conservative estimate to account for effects of spin , sfr and delay time .",
    "this model is given by @xmath103 for 1 hz@xmath104 400 hz .",
    "we note that using the two extreme spectra ( @xmath75 and @xmath77 ) in figure 2 leads to a variation in the results of less than @xmath2 .",

    "cols=\"<,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table [ table_rates ] outlines the constraints on @xmath22 we obtain through these different approaches for second generation detectors .",
    "we see that variation in the function @xmath105 between different detector pairs together with different sensitivity levels , produces a variation in the values of @xmath106 required for detection . among the 10 independent pairs of the five advanced detectors , h - l performs best as indicated by the lowest required value of @xmath22 ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "we note that these values are above the higher rate @xmath19 . for cross - correlation measurements between two ets , minimum detectable values of @xmath108 and @xmath109",
    "are obtained using et - b and et - d sensitivities respectively .",
    "the values presented by four - detector correlation , fc , suggest that no considerable advantage can be obtained through this approach .",
    "however , we see that by combining multiple pairs , cp , produces the most consistent improvement , the best of which comes from the ahlv combination ( around a @xmath2 improvement on h - l ) .",
    "equation ( 15 ) shows that applying the cp method to the 3 identical arms of et will reduce the minimum detectable values of @xmath22 by a factor of @xmath110 .",
    "we now adopt the same methods as employed in the last section to explore the parameter space of @xmath106@xmath111 required for a detectable bbh background . to allow for uncertainties in @xmath111 , we consider a large range of ( 420 ) @xmath0 .",
    "this range includes most values of @xmath111 within the low metallicity ( @xmath112 ) distribution of @xcite .",
    "we note however , that for the more realistic scenario that accounts for early common envelope mergers as the stars pass through the hertzsprung gap , the range is more constrained , with @xmath111 around ( 49 ) @xmath0 .",
    "figure 5 shows the @xmath106@xmath111 space for three different detection scenarios : 1 ) cross correlation of h - l  the best performing pair of advanced detectors ; 2 ) ahlv ( through cp )  the optimal combination of 4 advanced detectors ; 3 ) cross correlation of two et type detectors using two possible sensitivities ( et - b and et - d ) .",
    "zones encompassed by the two rates , @xmath17 and @xmath19 , are shown by the shaded areas .",
    "the figure further confirms that advanced detectors are not likely to detect the bbh background at the rate @xmath17 .",
    "detection would require the high rate estimate , @xmath19 and @xmath113 .",
    "such a range for @xmath106@xmath111 has been predicted by @xcite through studies of the two bh - wr systems , ngc300 x-1 and ic10 x-1 . a null detection would therefore confirm a lack of understanding in the binary evolution of such systems based on the single source models employed in this study .",
    "in regards to detection strategies for sgwb signals , figure 5 shows some improvement in detectability through the use of cp . as already noted in table [ table_rates ] , ahlv can improve the detectability by @xmath2 compared with only two advanced ligo detectors ( h - l ) .    for et , for the entire range of @xmath111",
    "the signal would be comfortably detected at the lower rate @xmath17 .",
    "a detectable continuous background requires a rate of order @xmath114 or above . in comparison with et - b",
    ", we find that a larger parameter space can be probed by et - d due to an improved sensitivity at lower frequencies ( @xmath115 hz ) .",
    "in this paper we have estimated the potential contribution of a population of coalescing bbhs to a sgwb signal .",
    "we are motivated by recent observations of bh - wr star systems @xcite and by new estimates in the metallicity abundances of star forming galaxies @xcite that have suggested the rate of bbhs in field populations may be greater than previously expected .",
    "we base the single source emissions on energy spectra calculated from recent parameterized waveforms of @xcite .",
    "then , assuming that the bbh rate traces the sfr with some delay time , we derive cosmic source rate evolution models and extrapolate our single - source model out to high redshifts . rather than a population synthesis approach , we assume average properties ( e.g. , masses and spins ) for the bbh population to determine the characteristics of the sgwb signal and principal parameters to which the bbh background is sensitive .",
    "our results show that for @xmath116 , the background is not likely to be detected through cross - correlation by two advanced detectors even at @xmath117 . only for greater values of @xmath111 , as have been predicted to result from bh - wr systems such as ngc300 x-1 and ic10 x-1 @xcite , there is scope for detection .    to further assess the detection prospects for second generation detectors , we have considered the possibility of combining a worldwide network of advanced detectors to improve the cross - correlation statistic , namely the methods fc and cp described in section 5.3 .",
    "we find that of these two approaches , cp can produce an improvement of up to @xmath2 against a standard cross - correlation between two detectors . for the third generation detector , et , the signal is accessible with a snr of 59 and 112 at the lower rate estimate @xmath118 using et - b and et - d sensitivities respectively .",
    "this signal could mask the primordial background signal at below around @xmath119 at @xmath120hz .",
    "we note that the rates used in this study are computed assuming milky way type galaxies and the standard formation channel  isolated binary evolution .",
    "massive binary formation in early elliptical galaxies is expected to improve the coalescence rate @xcite .",
    "this is particularly important for bbhs due to the longer delay time .",
    "in addition , dynamical formation scenarios in dense stellar environments can make a significant contribution to bbh rates .",
    "these other formation channels will not only increase the event rate of coalescing bbhs , but also add additional uncertainty to the average component masses of the bbh population .",
    "for example , simulations by @xcite suggest that the average chirp mass in clusters is @xmath121 , much larger than the same found in the field @xmath122 .",
    "this might indicate two similar backgrounds peaking at quite different frequencies .",
    "we have shown a minimum detectable @xmath22 for et at around @xmath123 , which may be in the range of rate predictions from dynamical formation scenarios @xcite .",
    "therefore , detection at the sensitivity of et could enable these two potential background signals to be untangled , thus allowing the average properties of the different populations to be probed .",
    "additionally , clues to how these two populations contribute to a confusion background may be provided by advanced ligo / virgo through single detections in the shot noise ( @xmath124 ) regime .",
    "new data analysis techniques , such as the probability event horizon method @xcite which extracts the temporal signature from a population of transient sources or the maximum likelihood statistic @xcite , could prove valuable in interrogating this regime .    in view of future searches for a primordial background signal , particularly for et",
    ", simulations incorporating both dynamical and isolated binary formation channels could prove useful .",
    "these will be considered in a future study .",
    "we thank cole miller for useful discussions during the early stages of this study .",
    "we also thank luciano rezzolla for a careful reading of the initial manuscript and for providing important feedback on the gravitational wave waveform parameters of coalescing bbhs .",

    "<S> we estimate the stochastic gravitational wave ( gw ) background signal from the field population of coalescing binary stellar mass black holes ( bhs ) throughout the universe . </S>",
    "<S> this study is motivated by recent observations of bh - wolf - rayet star systems and by new estimates in the metallicity abundances of star forming galaxies that imply bh - bh systems are more common than previously assumed . using recent analytical results of the inspiral - merger - ringdown waveforms for coalescing binary bh systems , we estimate the resulting stochastic gw background signal . assuming average quantities for the single source energy emissions , we explore the parameter space of chirp mass and local rate density required for detection by advanced and third generation interferometric gw detectors . for an average chirp mass of 8.7@xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , we find that detection through 3 years of cross - correlation by two advanced detectors will require a rate density , @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> combining data from multiple pairs of detectors can reduce this limit by up to @xmath2 . investigating the full parameter space </S>",
    "<S> we find that detection could be achieved at rates @xmath3 for populations of coalescing binary bh systems with average chirp masses of @xmath4 which are predicted by recent studies of bh - wolf - rayet star systems . </S>",
    "<S> while this scenario is at the high end of theoretical estimates , cross - correlation of data by two einstein telescopes could detect this signal under the condition @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> such a signal could potentially mask a primordial gw background signal of dimensionless energy density , @xmath6 , around the ( 1500 ) hz frequency range . </S>"
