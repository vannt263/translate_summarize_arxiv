    "@xcite in these materials time - reversal symmetry guarantees protection of conducting surface or edge states against backscattering , which is a requirement for dissipationless spin transport .",
    "usually , when a time - reversal symmetry breaking perturbation is applied , like a magnetic field for example , the edge states are not protected anymore and may acquire a gap .",

    "@xcite here , we will show that under certain circumstances even edge states of a topological insulator may become robust under a time - reversal symmetry breaking perturbation .",
    "in particular , a robust flat band may appear .",
    "recently , several materials , like bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , bi@xmath0te@xmath1 , sb@xmath0te@xmath1 , or pbbi@xmath0te@xmath3 have been experimentally identified as three dimensional topological insulators ( 3dti ) .",
    "@xcite the topological protection of the surface states and their spin - momentum coupled nature makes these systems particularly interesting for spintronics .",
    "several devices have been proposed theoretically .",
    "@xcite in particular , the combination with ferromagnetic materials or the application of magnetic fields can lead to interesting effects .    in the present work we study thin strips of 3dti materials in the presence of a time - reversal symmetry",
    "breaking zeeman field .",
    "zeeman fields can be introduced into topological insulators either by doping with ferromagnetic dopants @xcite or by proximity to a ferromagnetic material ( see fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) .",
    "we show that in this case certain additional spin - orbital symmetries are present , which are respected by the zeeman field .",
    "these symmetries can make the edge states robust even against a zeeman field .",
    "we will also show that at larger zeeman fields a phase transition appears into a state with a robust flat band .",
    "flat bands in solids are particularly interesting objects , because the group velocity vanishes , allowing for immobile wave packets , localized states , and a giant effective mass .",
    "@xcite the special feature of the flat band we find here is that it is tunable by the zeeman field and can be realistically achieved in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 thin films .",
    "we start from the lattice regularized version of an effective two - orbital model for three dimensional topological insulators suggested by li et al @xcite in the presence of a zeeman field .",
    "this is one of the two models that are currently being discussed for 3dti materials . @xcite",
    "these two models differ only in the way how the spin - orbit interaction couples in @xmath4-direction . for a thin strip confined in @xmath4-direction as considered here , both models yield the same effective two - dimensional hamiltonian .",
    "we are interested in strips sufficiently thin such that the top and bottom surface states are gapped out and the edge states become dominant at the fermi level .",
    "( for bi@xmath0se@xmath1 this would mean a film thickness of less than 6  nm .",
    "@xcite ) in this case the confinement in @xmath4-direction leads to a generic effective two - dimensional hamiltonian of the form : @xmath5 with @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 . here",
    ", the dirac @xmath10 matrices are represented by @xmath11 in the basis of bonding and antibonding @xmath12 orbital states .",
    "the pauli matrices in orbital space are denoted by @xmath13 and the ones in spin space by @xmath14 .",
    "the components of the zeeman field in @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath4-direction are denoted by @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 have been derived from bandstructure calculations for bi@xmath0se@xmath1 in ref .  .",
    "our parameter @xmath23 is an effective two dimensional parameter , which accounts for the finite film thickness @xmath24 .",
    "first , we will study a particle - hole symmetric system with @xmath25 .",
    "in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 the parameter @xmath21 is about a factor of three smaller than @xmath19 and its modest influence will be considered in section [ sec3 ] . without loss of generality we can set @xmath26 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) then possesses several spin - orbital symmetries in the absence of a zeeman field some of which remain valid for certain directions of the zeeman field . specifically , let us consider the following symmetry operators : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and parity @xmath31 .",
    "these symmetry operators share that they act on both orbital and spin degrees of freedom at the same time . in the absence of a zeeman field",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) fulfils the following symmetry relations : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 . in the presence of a zeeman field in @xmath4-direction the symmetries @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40",
    "are still respected , while @xmath41 is broken .",
    "in contrast , in the presence of a zeeman field in @xmath15-direction the symmetries @xmath41 , @xmath38 , and @xmath40 are still respected , while @xmath37 and @xmath39 are broken .",
    "all of these symmetry operations respect @xmath42 , thus their eigenvalues are @xmath43 .",
    "let us consider now a strip with finite extension in @xmath16-direction with @xmath44 $ ] , but periodic boundary conditions in @xmath15-direction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] . in the absence of a zeeman field",
    "the system possesses four topological edge states at the two edges @xmath45 and @xmath46 , two on each side .",
    "these edge states can be obtained analytically in small @xmath47 expansion following the method of ref .  .",
    "if @xmath48 is sufficiently larger than the localization length of the edgestates , we may consider the edges separately letting @xmath49 .",
    "the edge state wavefunctions are then linear superpositions of exponentially decaying functions of the form @xmath50 with the boundary conditions @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we will first proof that the dispersion of the edge states remains unaffected by a zeeman field in @xmath4-direction .",
    "consider the hamiltonian @xmath53 this is the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) with @xmath54 except for the @xmath55 term .",
    "note , that this hamiltonian anticommutes with the symmetry operation @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath56_+=0 $ ] .",
    "now assume that @xmath57 is a zero - energy eigenstate of @xmath58 .",
    "it is easy to show by direct calculation that such a zero - energy edge state exists , if @xmath59 . a second",
    "one exists , if @xmath60 .",
    "physically , this means that an edge state exist for each of the two spin - split bulk bands whenever there is a band inversion .",
    "@xcite equivalently , one can show that the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h0 ] ) possesses two flat bands protected by the symmetry @xmath37 , one for each of the two bulk bands using the topological invariant in ref .  .",
    "due to the anticommutation , @xmath57 either is an eigenstate of @xmath37 or can be constructed as such .",
    "now it turns out that @xmath61 .",
    "therefore @xmath57 will also be an eigenstate of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) ( with @xmath54 ) and its energy dispersion will thus be given by the prefactor of the @xmath55 term times the @xmath37  eigenvalue , i.e. @xmath62 .",
    "this result is apparently independent of @xmath63 ( and also of @xmath64 and @xmath19 , as long as the condition for the existence of the edge state is fulfilled ) .",
    "as the hamiltonian also commutes with @xmath39 we can deduce that the four edge states have to be proportional to @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , or @xmath68 , i.e. also the spin - orbital structure of the edge states remains unaffected by @xmath63 .",
    "it is only the spatial structure that changes .",
    "note , that this spin - orbital structure has the property that the expectation value of the total spin-@xmath4 component vanishes , because the spin in the two orbital subbands is just opposite .",
    "this is in contrast to the quantum spin hall system hgte , where the edge states consist of two orbital subbands having the same spin .",
    "@xcite in the present case , which is relevant for the edge states in a thin bi@xmath0se@xmath1 strip , this special feature explains why the edge states are robust against a zeeman field in @xmath4-direction .",
    "the robustness of the edge states can equally be understood from the existence of a flat band in the corresponding hamiltonian ( [ eq : h0 ] ) .",
    "the parity operator @xmath40 relates a state at one edge to a state with same energy and opposite @xmath69 on the other edge . from this",
    "we can conclude that the states @xmath65 and @xmath66 are localized on different edges and have the same spatial structure and the states @xmath67 and @xmath68 , too .",
    "for @xmath70 the symmetry @xmath71 shows that @xmath65 and @xmath68 are on the same edge with same momentum , but opposite energy .",
    "the same is true for @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "these statements also hold for finite @xmath63 even though @xmath41 is broken .    in order to confirm our analytical results",
    "we have diagonalized the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) with @xmath54 and @xmath72 on a finite lattice of size @xmath73 numerically with periodical boundary conditions in @xmath15-direction .",
    "the numerical results , shown in fig .  [ fig02 ] confirm the analytical proof . for @xmath74 we find four edge states , two on each side . when @xmath75 approaches 1 , the localization length of two of the edge states approaches the width of the system , similar to what has been found in ref .  .",
    "at @xmath76 the bulk bands touch the dirac point ( see fig .  [ fig02](b ) ) .",
    "when @xmath75 becomes larger than 1 , these two edge states disappear .",
    "the other two edge states survive , though .",
    "the system thus makes a quantum phase transition into a quantum anomalous hall state . throughout this transition the dispersion and the spin - orbital structure of the edge states remains unchanged , while the bulk spectrum changes , of course .",
    "let us next consider a zeeman field in @xmath15-direction . in this case",
    "the dispersion of the edge states changes , because @xmath77 does not anticommute with @xmath37 anymore .",
    "the symmetries @xmath41 and @xmath38 are still respected .",
    "let @xmath57 be an edge state of @xmath78 with energy @xmath79 .",
    "then , @xmath80 is an edge state with energy @xmath81 which is localized at the same edge .",
    "if we have just one edge state on each side , @xmath82 must hold and its energy thus has to be strictly zero , i.e. a flat band appears . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] , this happens for @xmath83 , where @xmath84 .",
    "this is a topological flat band as has been discussed recently in graphene @xcite and topological superconductors with gap nodes .",
    "@xcite such a flat band appears when the bulk gap closes , @xcite as is the case here , too .",
    "its existence is guaranteed by a topological invariant due to the chiral symmetry @xmath85 .",
    "@xcite in contrast to other flat band systems , however , in the present case the flat band is generated by a magnetic exchange field and thus is tunable experimentally .",
    "we will show below that it can be observed realistically in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] we show the dispersions of bulk and edge states above and below @xmath86 . for @xmath87",
    "we have four edge states .",
    "when @xmath88 two of these states disappear and a pair of bulk dirac points appears .",
    "these points are connected by a flat band of two edge states , one on each side of the strip .",
    "when the zeeman field is rotated within the @xmath15-@xmath16-plane the flat band becomes smaller and finally shrinks to a single point , when the zeeman field points in @xmath16-direction .",
    "so far we have discussed the particle - hole symmetric case @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , in which the two phenomena of stable dispersion and flat bands become particularly clear .",
    "we will now study parameters , which are realistic for bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , in order to show that these phenomena remain and how they are modified . according to zhang et al .",
    "@xcite the parameters are given by @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 , i.e. particle - hole symmetry is somewhat broken . here",
    ", we considered a film thickness of 3  nm and took the lattice constant @xmath94   .",
    "the parameter @xmath64 is the size of the bulk gap in the absence of a zeeman field .",
    "the parameter @xmath95 is a measure of the particle - hole asymmetry .",
    "we note that the particle - hole broken hamiltonian is adiabatically connected to the particle - hole symmetric one , if @xmath96 .",
    "this means that the topological phase is the same in both cases . for @xmath97",
    "the system would become topologically trivial .    following the method of zhou et al .",
    "@xcite we can determine the dispersion and structure of the edge states analytically , when a zeeman field in @xmath4-direction is applied .",
    "for the dispersions we find @xmath98 .",
    "the spin - orbital structure of the edge states turns out to be of the form @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 , where @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "for @xmath105 the particle - hole symmetric results above are reproduced .",
    "interestingly , the dispersions remain robust except for a constant energy shift of @xmath106 , which is reduced by the particle - hole asymmetry .",
    "the zeeman field does not create a gap in the dispersion of the edge states . also , the spin - orbital structure of the edge states neither depends on @xmath63 nor on @xmath69 . only the parameter @xmath107 determines the spin - orbital structure .    in fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] we present numerical dispersions for a finite bi@xmath0se@xmath1 strip in the presence of a zeeman field in @xmath4-direction using the parameters of zhang et al , which corroborate our analytical results .",
    "[ fig04](a ) shows that @xmath63 shifts the energies of the edge states , but does not change the shape of the dispersions .",
    "when @xmath75 exceeds @xmath108 , two of the four edge states disappear and the system makes a quantum phase transition into a quantum anomalous hall state similar to the one that has recently been found in bi(111 ) bilayers .",
    "@xcite    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     when the zeeman field is applied in @xmath15-direction , the symmetries @xmath41 and @xmath40 are still respected , while @xmath38 is broken .",

    "the state @xmath112 then is an edge state with same energy and momentum @xmath69 localized at the opposite edge and the edge state dispersion is twofold degenerate .    in fig .",

    "the criterion for the appearance of this flat band remains the same as in the particle - hole symmetric case above , i.e. @xmath83 , because its appearance is related to the closure of the bulk gap , which is unchanged , when @xmath117 .",
