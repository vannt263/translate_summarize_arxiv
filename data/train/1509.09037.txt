    "the importance of the randomness is that most atomistic simulation studies start with a flat ideal initial graphene sheet with fbc , which will be thermalized to a stable structure at finite temperature .",
    "the resulting stable structure can be either fbc-1 or fbc+1 configuration with certain probability , which is width dependent as illustrated in fig .",

    "[ fig_random_width80 ] shows that the stress strain relations for all graphene with the fbc-1 configuration fall into one curve ; while the stress strain relations for all graphene with the fbc+1 configuration fall into another curve .",
    "there is obvious difference between these two groups of stress - strain curves , which indicates that numerical simulations should obtain two different stress - strain relations for the same graphene , provided the free edges are not pre - warped in the initial structure .",

    "[ fig_unstable_tem ] that an isolated warped free edge has larger probability to flip its warping direction at higher temperatures .",
    "hence , it is natural to anticipate that the structure with fbc-1 configuration may be driven into the fbc+1 configuration by thermal vibrations at higher temperatures . in other words ,",
    "it is expected that , for graphene with @xmath69   , the probability of fbc-1 case will be reduced and becomes closer to the probability of fbc+1 case , if the temperature is increased . in this set of simulations , we initialized the velocity of the system with 50 different random velocity distributions for each temperature .",

    "after thermalization , both free edges in graphene are warped , and they are either in the fbc-1 configuration or in the fbc+1 configuration . the numbers for fbc-1 and fbc+1 cases were collected and their probabilities were calculated accordingly .    in fig .",

    "it is reasonable that the probability for graphene with fbc-1 configuration is larger than fbc+1 configuration , because we know that the potential for fbc-1 is lower than fbc+1 for graphene of width @xmath69   in fig .",

    "however , it is surprising that the probability for graphene with fbc-1 configuration is still larger than graphene with fbc+1 configuration at higher temperatures .",
    "this surprising result is attributed to the correlated flipping exhibited by the two free edges in fig .",
    "[ fig_random_temperature ]  ( b ) , which displays the z - position for the two warped free edges . as can be seen , when the warping direction of one free edge is flipped , the warping direction of the other free edge also flips simultaneously .",
    "this correlated flipping mechanism maintains the fbc-1 configuration , which ensures the larger probability for the fbc-1 configuration even at higher temperatures .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated a novel knotting phenomena induced by the interaction between free edges during the compression of graphene .",
    "the knotting phenomenon has substantial effects on the mechanical properties of buckled graphene , in particular significantly elevating the stress that can be sustained during the buckling process , which results in a higher mechanical stiffness than graphene without knotting , and in enabling graphene to exhibit a stable post - buckling regime where the amount of strain that can be sustained is significantly larger than the pre - buckling elastic strain .",
    "the knotting process was shown to be most probable for narrow graphene ribbons at lower temperatures .",
