    "asymptotically flat spacetimes in general relativity are intended to represent `` isolated systems , '' i.e. , systems far removed from the influence of other bodies . in order to give a precise definition of asymptotic flatness",
    ", one must specify the precise rate at which the metric approaches a minkowski metric at asymptotically large distances .",
    "there is no algorithm for doing this  i.e .",
    ", reasonable people may disagree on the precise fall - off conditions that may be used in the definition  but there are two guiding principles that must be respected : ( i ) the fall - off conditions must not so strong that they exclude the existence of phenomena that could otherwise occur in the deep interior of the spacetime .",
    "( ii ) the fall - off conditions should be sufficiently strong that useful notions that characterize the system , such as total mass and radiated energy flux , are well defined .",
    "asymptotic flatness conditions have been considered at both spatial infinity ( i.e. , asymptotically large distances on a cauchy surface ) and null infinity ( i.e. , asymptotically large distances along null geodesics ) .",
    "the situation at spatial infinity is relatively straightforward in that one need only specify asymptotic conditions on the initial data , since the initial data determines a solution .",
    "the positive mass theorem establishes that guiding principle ( i ) will be violated if one attempts to impose fall off conditions that are so strong as to imply vanishing mass ( e.g. , fall off faster than @xmath4 in @xmath5 spacetime dimensions ) . on the other hand , the corvino - schoen gluing theorems  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) establish that guiding principle ( ii ) will hold even if one requires that the initial data agrees exactly with kerr / myers - perry in a neighborhood of infinity .",
    "however , the prerequisite weighted sobolev inequalities also work in @xmath6  @xcite , see also appendix  d of  @xcite .",
    "it is then evident from the construction  @xcite that the gluing theorem continuesthe to hold also in @xmath6 provided one has a family of stationary , asymptotically flat metrics whose conserved adm - quantities exhaust all possible values compatible with the positive mass theorem",
    ". such a family is provided by the myers - perry solutions if we also apply an arbitrary asymptotic boost to these metrics  @xcite . ] .",
    "thus , there is ample room for defining asymptotic conditions compatible with both ( i ) and ( ii ) , and the precise choice is largely a matter of taste and convenience . it should be noted that , in general , if the choice of asymptotic fall off conditions is made weaker , then the group of asymptotic symmetries ( i.e. , the diffeomorphisms that preserve these asymptotic conditions ) is made larger . for",
    "sufficiently strong fall off conditions at spatial infinity compatible with ( i ) and",
    "( ii ) , the group of asymptotic symmetries will be the poincare group , whereas for weaker choices one can get enlargements of the poincare group . in view of the corvino - schoen gluing theorems",
    ", there is no essential reason not to impose sufficiently strong asymptotic conditions to reduce the group of asymptotic symmetries at spatial infinity to the poincare group .",
    "this conclusion holds in all spacetime dimensions .",
    "the situation at null infinity is considerably less straightforward .",
    "the main difficulty here is that one is not really free to specify asymptotic conditions at null infinity ; rather one must accept whatever one will get from evolving nonsingular , asymptotically flat initial data on a cauchy surface ( for some suitable notion of asymptotically flat initial data ) .",
    "thus , in particular , if weak cosmic censorship is false , one would violate guiding principle ( i ) merely by requiring nonsingular behavior at null infinity .",
    "nevertheless , one can obtain insights into the expected behavior at null infinity from general theorems that hold with small data  @xcite as well as from linearized perturbation theory about general solutions  @xcite .",
    "these results support the validity of the asymptotic conditions originally proposed by bondi et al  @xcite and elegantly reformulated in terms of conformal null infinity , @xmath7 , by penrose  @xcite . in section 2 below",
    ", we will review this formulation of asymptotic conditions at null infinity in all even dimensional spacetimes @xcite , so the analysis used in this paper does not apply . see also @xcite for a different approach . ] .",
    "as is well known and as we shall review in section 2 , with the above notion of asymptotic flatness at null infinity , the asymptotic symmetry group at null infinity is an enlargement of the poincare group known as the bms group  @xcite .",
    "the bms group contains an infinite dimensional commutative normal subgroup of `` supertranslations . ''",
    "it is natural to ask whether this enlargement of the poincare group is essential or  as is the case with spatial infinity ",
    "one could impose stronger asymptotic conditions without violating guiding principle ( i ) that would reduce the group of asymptotic symmetries at null infinity to the poincare group . in this paper",
    ", we shall argue that the enlargement of the group of asymptotic symmetries to the bms group is essential in @xmath8-spacetime dimensions , but in higher even - dimensional spacetimes , stronger asymptotic conditions can naturally be imposed at null infinity that reduce the asymptotic symmetry group to the poincare group .",
    "the reason for this difference is the presence of a `` memory effect '' in @xmath8 dimensions and  as we shall prove here  its absence in higher even - dimensional spacetimes .",
    "the memory effect is the permanent displacement of an arrangement of freely floating test masses , initially at rest , that is produced by the passage of a burst of gravitational radiation . here",
    "we are concerned only with the displacement occurring at the same @xmath9 order from the source as the usual oscillating displacements caused by gravitational radiation contributions to memory discussed in detail e.g. in @xcite . in particular , there is at lower order the usual acceleration that one even has in static spacetimes such as schwarzschild . ] .",
    "it was first discovered in @xcite in the context post - newtonian approximations to full general relativity .",
    "later , christodoulou  @xcite showed that there is also a contribution to memory arising from gravitational energy fluxes .",
    "the relationship between these considerations was clarified in @xcite , and more recently  @xcite .",
    "for a recent review with many more references , see @xcite .    in this paper , we shall show that the memory effect is unique to general relativity in four spacetime dimensions , i.e. , we shall show that there is no memory effect in higher even dimensions @xmath2 at the leading @xmath9 order where gravitational radiation causes test masses to accelerate .",
    "more precisely , we consider a spacetime satisfying the vacuum einstein equations near null infinity that is stationary before some advanced time @xmath10 and then again after some later advanced time  as can be arranged by a choice of initial data , as discussed above  then one can not expect the spacetime to become exactly stationary for @xmath11 , i.e. , we should consider a limit as @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , it should be noted if one considers a scattering process wherein one has particle - like matter sources that are incoming from infinity and/or outgoing to infinity at asymptotically early / late times , the spacetime will not be sufficiently stationary near future null infinity at early and late times for the analysis of this paper to apply .",
    "however , in a companion paper @xcite , we will analyze such scattering processes in the linearized approximation and show that our results on the absence of memory when @xmath6 continue to apply . ]",
    "we establish that during the radiation epoch @xmath14 , the time dependent metric components appear at order @xmath15 ( the precise statement refers to a geometrically constructed coordinate system explained in the body of this paper ) . on the other hand , the differences between the metric components before and after the radiation epochs are shown to appear at order @xmath16 . precisely in @xmath1 , these orders are the same .",
    "but in higher dimensions , @xmath17 , so the leading non - trivial metric components return to their original values after the radiation epoch .",
    "it follows that there is no memory effect in higher dimensions .",
    "our analysis also illuminates further the connection between the memory effect and bms supertranslations , discussed first in @xcite .",
    "the supertranslations are generated by vector fields of the form @xmath18 lower order terms , where @xmath19 is a function of the angular variables @xmath20 .",
    "our analysis shows that the metrics before and after the radiation epochs are related by an asymptotic boost together with such a bms supertranslation , i.e. , we can bring the metrics before and after the radiation epochs into a reference rest frame by a combination of a boost and a bms supertranslation .",
    "the boost going from the frame before to that after the radiation epoch is directly related to the change in bondi 4-momentum @xmath21 . in @xmath1 dimensions , we shall show in prop . 8 below that the supertranslation relating the initial and final metrics is given by    t(*z * ) = & 2(e_b- * p*_b*z * ) ( e_b- * p*_b*z * ) |_u_0^u_1 + & - 16_l=2^ f^(l)_i_1  i_l * z*^i_1 * z*^i_l  ,    where @xmath22 ( see  ) is the flux of gravitational radiation per angle @xmath23",
    " identified on the right side with a unit vector @xmath24  and where @xmath25 are its @xmath26-th multi - pole moments  .",
    "this formula , which generalizes eq .",
    "( 3.7 ) of @xcite , again relates the supertranslation parameter to physically observable quantities in @xmath1 , namely the flux and the bondi energy - momenta . as previously found by @xcite , when @xmath1 this supertranslation is related to the `` displacement tensor '' appearing in the memory effect by _ a^b = -(d_a d^b t - _",
    "a^b d^c d_c t ) , where @xmath27 are tensor indices referring to the angular coordinates .",
    "however , in @xmath2 , the frames before and after the radiation epochs are only boosted  not supertranslated  relative to each other . as we shall show in this paper , we have @xmath28 and @xmath29 when @xmath2 .",
    "the presence of a memory effect in @xmath1 shows that if we wish to treat frames at early and late time stationary eras on an equal footing , then we must allow supertranslations as asymptotic symmetries , and we can not impose stronger asymptotic conditions at @xmath7 that would reduce the asymptotic symmetry group to a group smaller than the bms group .",
    "conversely , the absence of a memory effect in @xmath2 suggests that for @xmath6 there is no need to allow supertranslations as asymptotic symmetries , and the asymptotic symmetry group at null infinity can be taken to be the poincare group .",
    "this argument may be made more precise as follows .    in @xmath5 dimensions ,",
    "the time dependent metric components encoding radiation start at order @xmath30 .",
    "in addition , there can be a non - trivial time - independent part that comes in at order @xmath31 . in @xmath2",
    ", we may apply a bms supertranslation to impose , as a gauge condition , the absence of this @xmath31 part .",
    "in particular , if this @xmath31 part is removed in one stationary epoch , then it is also removed in any other . with this gauge condition imposed ,",
    "the group of allowed asymptotic symmetries is just the poincare group .",
    "by contrast , in @xmath1 , this is not possible , since imposition of such a condition would remove all radiating solutions .    of course",
    ", one still would be free to not impose such stronger gauge conditions when @xmath2 and thereby allow supertranslations as asymptotic symmetries in @xmath6 , as has been suggested in  @xcite .",
    "however , there would appear to be little advantage in doing so .",
    "in particular , when @xmath2 , the symplectic flux through @xmath7 associated with supertranslations diverges  @xcite .",
    "this implies that one can not define , at least in as far as we can see , a hamiltonian generator conjugate to a supertranslation in higher dimensions .",
    "thus , even if one were to allow supertranslations , there appears to be no reasonable notion of the `` charge '' or `` flux '' associated with a supertranslation when @xmath2 .    in section [ af ] ,",
    "we review the notion of asymptotic flatness at null infinity and the notion of asymptotic bms symmetries that it gives rise to . in section [ s1 ]",
    ", we consider the asymptotic form of the metric near null infinity in the case of a stationary spacetime .",
    "the asymptotic form of a non - stationary metric near null infinity is then obtained in section [ s2 ] . the relationship between the form of the metric before and after a burst of gravitational radiation is analyzed in section [ memory ] . in @xmath1 ,",
    "this difference is characterized by an asymptotic boost and a supertranslation , but for @xmath2 , the supertranslation vanishes .",
    "we show that the memory effect is directly related to the supertranslation characterizing the difference between the metric before and after the radiation burst .",
    "thus , the memory effect vanishes when @xmath2 . our reasons for concluding that the asymptotic symmetry group at null infinity should be taken to be the poincare group when @xmath2 are summarized in section [ summary ] .",
    "in a companion paper @xcite , we will analyze the memory effect in linearized gravity off of minkowski spacetime for point particles undergoing a local interaction .",
    "we will show there by explicit calculation that the memory effect vanishes when @xmath2 .",
    "our * conventions and notations * for the signature , riemann curvature tensor etc .",
    "are the same as in  @xcite .",
    "@xmath5 is the dimension of the spacetime @xmath32 .",
    "bold face letters such as @xmath33 or @xmath34 refer to vectors in @xmath35 , and the standard inner product between such vectors is denoted by a dot .",
    "our units are such that @xmath36 .",
    "an even dimensional ( @xmath0 ) spacetime @xmath37 is said to be asymptotically flat at null infinity if the following conditions are satisfied :    1 .",
    "there exists a function @xmath38 such that @xmath39 can be smoothly extended to an `` unphysical '' spacetime @xmath40 with boundary @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a compact @xmath44 dimensional manifold .",
    "2 .   @xmath45 is a null vector field on @xmath46 relative to @xmath47 , and on @xmath48 , there holds @xmath49 .",
    "3 .   the vacuum einstein equations @xmath50 hold for @xmath51 in an open neighborhood of @xmath46 .    for a more detailed discussion ,",
    "see  @xcite or chapt .",
    "11 of  @xcite .",
    "a characterization of precisely which initial data sets yield a time evolved metric that will satisfy these asymptotic conditions is an extremely difficult dynamical problem .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , a good indication supporting the asymptotic flatness conditions is that they are preserved by smooth linear perturbations that have compact support in the interior of a cauchy surface , see  @xcite for @xmath1 and  @xcite in @xmath6 . semi - global results ( evolving data backwards from @xmath46 ) in the non - linear regime were obtained in @xcite ( in all even @xmath6 ) following the pioneering work of @xcite ( in @xmath1 )  , more stringent conditions can be imposed than expressed by ( i)-(iii ) .",
    "we will see that these conditions are actually a consequence , see thm .  .",
    "] . global results which establish ( i)(iii ) for small but non - linear perturbations of minkowski are  @xcite ( in @xmath1 ) and @xcite ( for all even @xmath6 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we will simply assume ( i)(iii ) .",
    "it is then always possible to choose the conformal factor @xmath38 in such a way such that the metric @xmath51 has `` conformal gaussian null form '' near @xmath46 . by definition",
    ", this means that [ pen ] g = \\ { 2 du(d- ^2 du- _ a dz^a ) + _ ab dz^a dz^b } = g  , where @xmath52 can be viewed as tensor fields @xmath43 that smoothly depend on @xmath53 , and where @xmath54 are local coordinates on @xmath43 .",
    "the name arises first of all because the unphysical metric @xmath47 is in gaussian null form .",
    "geometrically these coordinates have the following properties . on @xmath46 , @xmath55 is tangent to affinely parameterized null geodesics ruling @xmath46 relative to @xmath47 .",
    "the coordinates @xmath54 are defined first on a cross - section , @xmath56 , corresponding to the constant value @xmath10 of the coordinate @xmath57 , and then they are transported to all of @xmath46 along @xmath58 .",
    "the vector field @xmath59 is another affinely parameterized ( relative to @xmath47 ) null vector field transverse to @xmath46 which is normalized so that @xmath60 , and such that it is orthogonal to the cross sections @xmath61 on @xmath46 .",
    "the coordinates @xmath62 are then transported to a sufficiently small neighborhood of @xmath46 by transport along @xmath63 .",
    "the term `` conformal '' refers to the key point that @xmath38 is not only an affine parameter of null geodesics of @xmath47 , but also coincides with the conformal factor .",
    "if we define r= , we get from   a `` bondi - type '' coordinate system : [ pen1 ] g = -2 du(dr + du+ r _ a dz^a ) + r^2 _ ab dz^a dz^b  , and this is just another way to state our asymptotic conditions .",
    "the coordinate vector field @xmath64 defined by the system @xmath65 is easily checked to be tangent to affinely parameterized null geodesics relative to @xmath51 .",
    "this fact is ultimately responsible for the preferred geometrical status of our coordinate system .    for @xmath5-dimensional minkowski spacetime @xmath66 , we have @xmath67 , @xmath68",
    "are given by @xmath69 , and in fact [ eta ] = -2 du(dr + du ) + r^2 s_ab dz^a dz^b where here and in the rest of the paper @xmath70 denotes the unit radius round sphere metric .",
    "for schwarzschild , @xmath71 with @xmath72 given by the tortoise coordinate .",
    "it can be readily seen that the remaining freedom in specifying a conformal gaussian null coordinate system is as follows : we can make a different choice of the initial cross section @xmath56 ; we can change the affine coordinate @xmath57 on @xmath46 by an affine transformation for each null generator of @xmath46 ; we can similarly apply a suitable `` angle - dependent '' affine transformation of the parameter @xmath73 consistent with the requirement @xmath74 on @xmath46 ; we can apply a diffeomorphisms to the points @xmath75 in @xmath56 .",
    "thus our freedom consist of :    1 .",
    "changing @xmath76 , 2 .",
    "changing @xmath77 on @xmath46 and making corresponding changes to @xmath78 , 3 .",
    "changing @xmath79 on @xmath46 and making corresponding changes to @xmath78 , 4 .   applying a diffeomorphism to points @xmath80 .",
    "it is easy to see that by choosing @xmath81 in the transformation of type 1 ) suitably , we can set @xmath82 to a constant on @xmath46 , which we assume has been done . for convenience , we assume that the constant is @xmath83 on @xmath46 , as in minkowski spacetime  . thus , the remaining transformations of type 1 ) are ones where @xmath84 does not depend on @xmath57",

    "typically assumes that , topologically @xmath87 , for otherwise one could clearly not say that the metric is asymptotically minkowskian . we can then turn @xmath85 into the metric @xmath70 on the unit round sphere on @xmath46 for one particular cross - section of @xmath46 , say @xmath88 . in higher dimensions , we assume as a strengthening of our asymptotic conditions :    1 .",
    "@xmath89 is conformal to an einstein space for some value of @xmath57 ( we do not have to do this , but then it seems impossible to define bondi mass , news etc . , see  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , we will assume that this einstein space is a unit round sphere @xmath90 on @xmath46 to the scalar curvature of @xmath85 on @xmath46 .",
    "we have anticipated this relation in our choice for the normalization . ] .",
    "einstein s equations then imply  @xcite that @xmath85 is equal to @xmath70 on @xmath46 for _ any _ value of @xmath57 .",
    "thus , we have fixed the first two ambiguities .",
    "the ambiguity of type 3 ) corresponds to the choice of the cross section distinguished by @xmath91 , i.e. a change in the cross section .",
    "this corresponds to bms supertranslations .",
    "the last ambiguity type 4 ) is cut down because we have already demanded that , on @xmath46 , @xmath85 is the metric of the round sphere , @xmath70 .",
    "so we are left with diffeomorphisms that are conformal transformations of this round sphere ( group @xmath92 ) , and then we must combine such a diffeomorphism with a transformation of type 2 ) to compensate the conformal factor .",
    "summarizing our discussion , we can say that the remaining diffeomorphisms of the metric respecting our gauge choices near @xmath46 are generated by linear combinations of the following vector fields @xmath93 defined in a neighborhood of @xmath46 :    1 .",
    "vector fields x = s(z ) +   , where @xmath84 is an arbitrary smooth function on @xmath94 .",
    "vector fields [ super ] x = t(z ) ( - ) - s^ab d_b t(z ) +   , where @xmath19 is any smooth function on @xmath94 orthogonal to the @xmath95 spherical harmonics .",
    "these @xmath93 are precisely the `` bms supertranslations '' .",
    "3 .   vector fields @xmath93 of the form  , where @xmath19 is a linear combination of @xmath96 spherical harmonics on @xmath94 . such @xmath19",
    "satisfy d_a d_b t = -s_ab t. these @xmath93 correspond to infinitesimal spatial translations of the underlying `` minkowski spacetime '' given by eq .  .",
    "4 .   the vector field x = +   .",
    "this @xmath93 corresponds to an infinitesimal time translation .",
    "vector fields x = c(z)- s^ab d_b c(z ) +   , where @xmath97 is an @xmath96 spherical harmonic  implying that @xmath98 is a conformal killing vector field of @xmath94 .",
    "these @xmath93 correspond to infinitesimal lorentz boosts .",
    "vector fields of the form x = ^a +   , where @xmath99 is an isometry of @xmath94 .",
    "these @xmath93 correspond to infinitesimal rotations .    in all cases the dots @xmath100 stand for a vector field that vanishes on @xmath46 together with its first and second derivative ( relative to an arbitrary derivative operator on @xmath40 such as @xmath101 ) .",
    "this vector field is uniquely determined in each case by the requirement that @xmath102 satisfies the `` linearized form '' of our gauge conditions  , i.e. has vanishing @xmath103 components .",
    "thus the parts of @xmath93 indicated by dots depend in general on @xmath51 ( but happen to vanish for @xmath104 ) , but the leading terms displayed in ( iia , b , c)(iv ) manifestly do not .",
    "the vector field of type ( i ) is to be viewed as a `` gauge transformation '' , since it vanishes on @xmath46 .",
