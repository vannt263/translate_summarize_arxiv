    "in order to connect the observables of the antiferromagnetic ising model on the checkerboard lattice with those of the 16-vertex model it is useful to recall the mapping which leads from the latter model to the former . fig .",
    "[ f.map ] illustrates such a mapping ; starting from a 6-vertex configuration ( fig .",
    "[ f.map](a ) ) , one maps the sign of the projections of the arrows along , _",
    "e.g. _ , the @xmath83-axis onto ising spins ( pointing up for a positive projection and down otherwise - fig .  [ f.map](b ) ) . flipping the ising spins of every other row ( fig .  [ f.map](c ) ) , gives zero ( ising - spin ) magnetization on each vertex if the corresponding vertex configuration is a 6-vertex one obeying the 2-in/2-out ice rule ( a similar mapping is obtained by flipping every other column ) .",
    "in particular ice - rule vertices having counterpropagating arrows on parallel bonds are mapped onto nel vertices for the ising spins , while ice - rule vertices with copropagating arrows on parallel bonds are mapped onto collinear vertices .",
    "the asymptotic correlation function for the @xmath83 spin components of the 6-vertex model has been calculated exactly in ref .  .",
    "introducing the spin - flip of every other row , this translates into the following behavior for the ising - spin correlation function @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the corresponding static structure factor features a pinch point around @xmath87 as @xcite @xmath88 for @xmath89 . on the other hand ,",
    "the ensemble of ice - rule states is _ invariant _ under all operations mapping ice - rule states onto ice - rule states ; one such operation is the mirror reflection around the ( 1,1 ) axis , which produces a mirror pinch point around @xmath90 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f.phd ] of the main text .",
    "another important exact result for the 6-vertex model due to sutherland @xcite is that the correlation function between parallel arrows has a staggered part , decaying as @xmath5 , beside the non - oscillating part leading to the pinch point .",
    "when mapping to the ising spins , this implies that the spin - spin correlation function among spins on , _",
    "e.g. _ the a sublattice of the square lattice ( underlying the checkerboard lattice ) has the simple form @xmath91 .",
    "this would imply a logarithmically divergent peak in the static structure factor for @xmath92 , and at the equivalent points @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "in fact when considering the whole static structure factor @xmath95 ( where @xmath96 is the nearest neighbor to @xmath97 in the same unit cell ) , one observes that the unit - cell form factors @xmath98 suppress the peak at @xmath99 , given that ice - rule states typically display an antiferromagnetic configuration ( @xmath100 ) on the unit cell  4 out of 6 ice - rule states verify this property .",
    "hence the static structure factor displays a logarithmically divergent peak only for @xmath101 and equivalent points .",
    "here we describe the extension of the loop algorithm , of crucial importance for the simulation of classical spin ice @xcite , to the case of quantum spin ice .",
    "the trotter - suzuki ( ts ) mapping @xcite of the quantum partition function of a transverse - field ising model ( tfim ) allows to map the model in question onto a @xmath102-dimensional classical ising model .",
    "if @xmath12 trotter steps are used in the ts decomposition , the partition function takes the form @xmath103 $ ] , involving the effective action @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the ising variable at lattice site @xmath106 and trotter ( imaginary - time ) step @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 with @xmath110 by construction .",
    "hence quantum square ice is ts - mapped onto stacked , classical spin - ice layers interacting ferromagnetically .",
    "the membrane algorithm consists then in building a loop ( as in the loop algorithm ) in a spin - ice layer at imaginary time step @xmath107 , or an open string in the presence of defect vertices - the latter being induced either by quantum or by thermal fluctuations .",
    "an open string is built so as to touch at most one defect vertex containing a single monopole , and if so , the defect vertex lies necessarily on one of the string end points - hence a string which does not touch any defect vertex closes on itself forming a loop . in the absence of the @xmath111 couplings , the loop ( or open string )",
    "can be flipped at zero energy cost - in particular , a flipped open string has the effect of  teleporting \" the defect vertex from one of its ends to the opposite one . yet , in the presence of the @xmath111 couplings , the loop / string flip will cause an energy variation ; for @xmath112 ( which is the fundamental requirement for the ts approximation to be accurate ) , the ferromagnetic couplings are extremely strong ( diverging like @xmath113 ) and hence one can reasonably expect that the energy variation induced by the loop / string flip is best cured by proposing an identical flip on the two neighboring layers at imaginary time steps @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "this amounts then to grow the loop / string into the imaginary time dimension , namely into a membrane .",
    "the membrane grows _",
    "e.g. _ to the @xmath116-th layer with a probability @xmath117\\ ] ] and @xmath118 is the loop / string .",
    "the above probability @xmath119 corresponds to the cluster growth probability for the wolff algorithm @xcite , performed along the imaginary - time dimension .    once the membrane has been grown , the flip of its spins is not automatic , because one still has to consider the energy change on the bonds connecting the membrane spins and those on its contour in real space .",
    "hence the membrane is flipped with probability @xmath120 \\label{e.flip}\\ ] ] where @xmath121 is the ensemble of membrane spins , @xmath122 represents the set of lattice sites neighboring the site @xmath106 , and the primed sum indicates that one has to exclude the sites belonging to the membrane .",
    "the probability @xmath123 has value 1 in the classical limit @xmath124 , @xmath125 , in which all the layers display the same configuration , and hence a microcanonical loop / string on a layer is equally microcanonical on every other layer - obviously the membrane length in the imaginary - time dimension is @xmath12 . for a finite transverse field , on the other hand , the flip probability will be typically reduced due to the presence of discontinuities in the imaginary - time propagation - associated with defect vertices ( namely monopoles ) appearing in isolated layers .",
    "a nave estimate of the scaling of the membrane flip probability gives @xmath126 $ ] , where @xmath127 is the density of ( free ) monopoles in the system , and @xmath128 is the number of spins belonging to the membrane . such a scaling would imply that the probability is inevitably suppressed exponentially as the temperature is decreased .",
    "yet we will argue in the following that this is not the case .",
    "we observe that , if membranes are built from long ( namely self - intersecting ) loops , then @xmath129 , associated with the known scaling of the long - loop length @xmath130 with system size @xmath37 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the length of short loops does not scale with system size , so that @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "hence the choice of short loops as pedestals of the membranes boosts the acceptance rate .",
    "moreover , at very low temperatures , @xmath132 , the thermal monopole density @xmath127 is exponentially suppressed , while the monopoles induced by quantum fluctuations are bound , as discussed in the main text .",
    "hence their effect on the suppression of the flip probability is not as simple as their density @xmath127 appearing in the previous scaling formula .",
    "in particular a simple estimate ( coming from perturbation theory ) of the typical size of a bound monopole pair gives @xmath133 .",
    "we can therefore imagine that the flip probability of a membrane @xmath121 built upon a loop / string @xmath118 will be affected by bound monopole pairs only if such monopole pairs cross the loop / string , hence if they fall within a region of size @xmath134 .",
    "the density of monopole pairs in the @xmath102 dimensional sample can be estimated as @xmath135 ( as each spin flip contributing to the transverse magnetization corresponds to a monopole pair ) .",
    "this means that the exponential suppression of @xmath123 due to bound monopole pairs can be estimated as @xmath136 .",
    "working at a fixed length of the trotter step @xmath137 , and if @xmath138 ( using short loops ) , we find that the membrane flip probability is _ not _ reduced when lowering the temperature , and that the exponent is of @xmath139 , implying a sizable acceptance rate ( in fact quite large if @xmath140 ) .",
    "this conclusion is corroborated by the numerically observed temperature scaling of the acceptance rate for the membrane flip @xcite .",
    "given the very strong correlations between neighboring layers , we observe that the membrane typically extends over a significant fraction of the imaginary - time dimension . as the linear size of wolff clusters is related to the correlation length of the system @xcite , we deduce that the imaginary - time correlation length is very large , as the system has a very small spectral gap , associated with the quantum lifting of the degeneracy between the ice - rule states .",
    "hence the membrane moves has the important virtue of producing very low - energy moves which allow to explore efficiently the very dense energy spectrum at low energy ",
    "similarly to the loop algorithm for classical spin ice , which allows to explore microcanonically the whole ice - rule manifold .",
    "our pimc simulations of quantum square ice are typically performed with a trotter parameter @xmath141 , guaranteeing a very small trotter error on the observables of interest ( transverse magnetization , static structure factor ) . to ensure ergodicity , we supplement the membrane algorithm with metropolis single - spin flips , as well as with traditional wolff clusters on the effective @xmath102-dimensional ising model of eq .  [ e.seff ] .",
    "a monte carlo step is composed of @xmath142 short loop membrane moves and @xmath143 long loop membrane moves , as well as of @xmath144 wolff cluster moves and @xmath145 single metropolis spin flips .",
    "our simulation typically contains @xmath146 thermalization steps and @xmath147 measurement steps .",
    "order - by - disorder phenomena in frustrated magnets can be driven either by quantum fluctuations or by thermal fluctuations - noticeable examples of the second case are _",
    "e.g. _ the @xmath148 antiferromagnet @xcite and the kagom antiferromagnet @xcite .",
    "one might therefore suspect that the classically ordered phase found in quantum square ice , namely the canted nel phase , is actually stabilized by thermal and not by quantum fluctuations . in order to check that the nel ordering of quantum square ice is a purely quantum effect , we performed a classical mc simulation of continuous spin ( @xmath149 ) square ice in a transverse field @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath150 here @xmath151 is a classical 3-dimensional vector of unit norm .",
    "we used metropolis updates completed with generalized short- and long - loop moves .",
    "the loop algorithm for ising spin ice @xcite is generalized to the case of continuous spins in the following manner : a loop is built as for ising spins , using the sign of the @xmath152 component as effective ising spin variable ; the loop flip is not microcanonical for continuous spins , and it is then accepted / rejected with metropolis probability @xmath153 $ ] where @xmath154 is the energy variation .",
    "we find no nel ordering throughout the range of transverse field magnitude for which the @xmath152 component retains a finite value ( @xmath155 $ ] ) , as it can be inferred from the finite - size scaling of the order parameter shown in fig .",
    "[ f.mnc ] . here",
    "the order parameter is estimated as @xmath156 .",
    "we have applied the membrane algorithm described above to the study of the ordering transition of the fcqed of eq .",
    "[ e.h4eff ] - a detailed description will be reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the transition of fcqed has apparently eluded previous numerical investigations @xcite due to the difficulty in sampling different topological sectors of ice - rule states .",
    "the membrane algorithm guarantees on the other hand an efficient sampling of the various topological sectors for sufficiently high temperatures and moderate system sizes .",
    "the order parameter for the pvbs phase is the staggered flippability @xmath157 we evaluate the critical inverse temperature @xmath158 through the calculation of the binder cumulant @xmath159 for different system sizes - shown in fig .",
    "[ f.binder ] .",
    "the crossing of the curves for system sizes @xmath37 and @xmath160 occurs at @xmath161 .",
    "we linearly extrapolate this value to @xmath162 to obtain the transition temperature in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the result of the extrapolation gives @xmath163 , which corresponds to a transition temperature @xmath164 .",
    "we extract the effective hamiltonian up to 8th order in degenerate perturbation theory in the transverse field of eq .   via the resolvent method @xcite . using the notations @xmath167 and @xmath168 , the effective hamiltonian reads @xmath169 with @xmath170 the projector onto the ground - state manifold of @xmath171 ( ice - rule states ) .",
    "the factors @xmath172 are sensitive to the number of virtual monopole pairs created in the intermediate configurations at the energy cost of @xmath173 per pair .",
    "a term of order @xmath44 contains @xmath44 @xmath174 operators , corresponding to the flip of at most @xmath44 spins ( it can be less than @xmath44 because some of spins might be flipped multiple times ) .",
    "the general form of the effective hamiltonian in terms of projectors contains several terms which seemingly lead to super - extensive contributions to the energy .",
    "those terms must cancel out to recover an extensive effective hamiltonian - we checked explicitly this aspect up to fourth order ; as for higher order , we simply discard the non - extensive terms .",
    "moreover all terms with @xmath44 odd necessarily vanish , as they do not conserve the vanishing magnetization of the ice - rule states .",
    "the off - diagonal terms in eq .",
    "come from the flip of closed loops of spins ( of even number ) of alternating orientations ; such flip preserves the constraint of zero magnetization on each vertex , connecting therefore different ice configurations .",
    "the effective hamiltonian can then be rewritten as @xmath175 here the loop index @xmath42 is summed over all loops @xmath43 of length @xmath44 .",
    "the factors @xmath176 take into account two aspects : 1 ) the number of sequences of elementary spin flips leading to the flip of the loop @xmath42 of length @xmath44 ; 2 ) the number of intermediate monopole pairs created in the process .",
    "in particular the @xmath176 coefficients admit the following decomposition : @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the multiplicity of spin - flip sequences leading to the virtual creation of a single monopole pair ; @xmath179 is the multiplicity of spin - flip sequences involving the creation of two monopole pairs for @xmath180 configurations out of the @xmath181 virtual intermediate ones ; @xmath182 is the multiplicity of spin flip sequences involving the creation of two monopole pairs during @xmath180 steps and three monopole pairs during @xmath183 steps , etc .",
    "it is apparent that the enumeration of all processes ( especially those of higher order in the number of virtual monopole pairs ) , represents an increasingly hard problem when going up in perturbation order . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we restrict our calculations to the one - monopole - pair term @xmath178 only .",
    "this restriction leads then to the effective hamiltonian eq .   of the main text , with the following coefficients @xmath184 in particular the coefficient",
    "@xmath185 multiplies a diagonal term , coming from the forward and backward flip of the same ( flippable ) plaquette , and therefore simply counting the number of flippable plaquettes .    in the case of 4-th order term",
    "it is easy to account for all processes ( involving up to two monopole pairs ) ; this gives @xmath186 , which we use for the exact estimate of the coefficient @xmath187 entering the hamiltonian of fcqed .",
    "gauge mean - field theory ( gmft ) , as introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , consists generically of a mean - field decoupling between the matter field and the gauge field in a gauge theory . in the case of quantum spin ice , one can identify an emergent lattice gauge theory description of the system in which the gauge field is essentially represented by the off - diagonal hamiltonian terms leading to quantum fluctuations between ice - rule states , while the matter field is represented by the monopole excitations associated with the diagonal part of the hamiltonian .",
    "formally the gauge and matter field are not distinct mathematical objects , but they are in fact associated with different components of the same lattice spin field . in order to recover a description of spin ice in terms of a standard lattice gauge theory",
    ", it is then necessary to artificially enlarge the hilbert space of spin variables , in order to accommodate a properly defined matter field in the system .",
    "this is done by the following redefinition of the spin operators @xmath188 here @xmath189 is a spin @xmath3 field ( acting as the _ gauge _ field ) , living on the sites of the checkerboard lattice , which represent the bonds between sites @xmath71 and @xmath72 of the vertex lattice ( see fig .",
    "[ f.sketch](a ) of the main text ) .",
    "the _ matter _",
    "field @xmath190 is a bosonic field , @xmath191 = \\delta_{rr'}$ ] living on the vertex lattice ; it is chosen to be of unit amplitude , @xmath192 , where @xmath193 is a phase operator canonically conjugated to a charge operator @xmath75 , @xmath76 = i$ ] ; this choice preserves the values of the matrix elements of the spin operators .",
    "nonetheless the newly defined spin operators of eq .",
    "act on a larger hilbert space , which is infinite - dimensional ( as @xmath75 takes integer values from @xmath194 to @xmath195 ) .",
    "in fact the bosonic field represents the monopole / spinon field if one enforces the constraint @xmath196 where the sum runs over the vertices which are nearest neighbors of the one at position @xmath71 ( namely on the spins contained in the vertex in question ) . in this case @xmath197 .",
    "this constraint will not be explicitly implemented in the following , but it will emerge dynamically in the relevant range of validity of the theory .    for the tfim ,",
    "the hamiltonian acting on the enlarged hilbert space takes the simple form @xmath198 the gmft approach consists then in the mean - field decoupling @xmath199 which leads to the hamiltonian decomposition @xmath73 as in eqs .  - of the main text .",
    "the mean - field decoupling between the gauge field and the matter field necessarily implies that the gauge theory is described in its _ deconfined _ phase - indeed the matter field only sees a uniform , mean - field gauge field @xmath200 , which is not confining .",
    "hence such a decoupling can be applied exclusively to the thermally induced quantum coulomb phase .",
    "moreover the mean - field decoupling provides a featureless description of the spin gauge field , and it can not describe the nature of the excitations in the pure gauge sector of the theory ( namely the photon ) . on the other hand the matter sector of the theory has a non - trivial description in terms of a quantum rotor model @xmath79 . if we interpret @xmath201 as the deviation from an average , integer density @xmath202 , we see that the monopole pairs represent particle - hole excitations of a bose fluid living on the lattice of vertices .",
    "such a fluid is in a mott insulator phase for @xmath203 ( which is the domain of applicability of gmft to our model ) : in this phase particle - hole fluctuations are suppressed , so that configurations with @xmath204 are energetically excluded without the need to enforce explicitly the corresponding constraint .",
    "we solve the quantum rotor model on a square lattice using path - integral monte carlo , as described in ref .",
    "in particular our simulation aims at the ground - state kinetic energy @xmath205 - we observe that , for a system with @xmath206 , @xmath207 and @xmath208 , thermal , finite - size and trotter - approximation effects are all essentially removed .",

    "<S> one might suspect that such a phase is already present in the classical ( @xmath39 ) limit of the tfim due to an order - by - disorder mechanism induced by thermal fluctuations ; we have checked explicitly this aspect ( see @xcite ) and we do not find any form of magnetic order in the classical , continuous spin version of eq .   at small but finite temperature . </S>",

    "<S> one can do so systematically following _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite - see @xcite for an extensive discussion </S>",
    "<S> . in general the effective hamiltonian within degenerate perturbation theory represents a most general u(1 ) gauge theory of the quantum - link model type in the _ pure gauge _ </S>",
    "<S> sector , namely in the absence of matter ( which for quantum spin ice is represented by monopoles ) . </S>",
    "<S> the gauge symmetry of the effective hamiltonian is not shared by the original tfim hamiltonian , and in particular the ground state of the tfim hamiltonian does contain a finite concentration of monopoles ( resulting in a finite transverse magnetization  </S>",
    "<S> see below for further discussion ) . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the ground state of the tfim will not have the same topological properties as the effective hamiltonian ( the transverse field mixes several topological sectors , while the effective hamiltonian does not ) ; but one expects the same symmetry breaking phenomena to be exhibited by the ground states of both hamiltonians . to gain a quantitative understanding of the nel phase </S>",
    "<S> , it turns out to be necessary to push the perturbative expansion up to _ 8th _ order in the magnetic field ; to this order the effective hamiltonian - obtained by considering exclusively virtual processes involving the creation / annihilation of a single monopole pair - reads : @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the operator flipping the spins ( in alternate fashion ) on a loop @xmath42 , belonging to the family @xmath43 of loops of length @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients @xmath45 are given explicitly in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the last term is a purely _ diagonal _ term , which amounts to counting the number of flippable plaquettes , and therefore its energy is minimized by the nel state , being the maximally flippable state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence we can expect that the pvbs - nel transition is fundamentally driven by the competition between the 4th order term and the diagonal 8th order term . </S>",
    "<S> indeed an hamiltonian comprising exclusively those two terms has been studied in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite using exact diagonalization , and a transition from nel to pvbs is predicted to occur for a critical ratio @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio between these two coefficients can be controlled in the tfim via the transverse field , @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the field corresponding to @xmath48 is @xmath49 , a value which lies reasonably close to the field range in which the nel order is seen to appear in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> as well the processes involving more than a single monopole pair ) .    _ quantum coulomb phase . </S>",
    "<S> _ finally , we focus on the thermally disordered phase in quantum square ice . </S>",
    "<S> as already mentioned in the introduction , pinch points with _ </S>",
    "<S> zero _ width in the static structure factor @xmath50 are a consequence of algebraic spin - spin correlations of the classical coulomb phase of 2@xmath4 spin ice @xcite , which are in turn a characteristic feature of the spatial correlations of the divergenceless magnetization field of square ice @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f.phd](b,a-b ) and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f.neel ] shows that , for weak field and low temperatures ( namely for the paramagnetic phase lying immediately above the pvbs phase ) , pinch - point features survive in the structure factor , despite the fact that the transverse field induces a finite concentration of monopoles in the system . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the spin - spin correlation length , even if finite due to the finite temperature and the finite concentration of monopoles , remains extremely large . </S>",
    "<S> indeed monopole pairs induced by the transverse field are strongly off - resonant ( as @xmath51 ) , and hence they form bound states ; as a consequence they screen each other , only moderately affecting the spin - spin correlations . </S>",
    "<S> this interpretation is strongly corroborated when considering that the typical distance between monopole defects induced by the field can be estimated as the typical distance between two spins flipped by the transverse field , namely @xmath52 - giving @xmath53 when @xmath54 ; on the other hand we observe in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f.neel ] that the width of the pinch points is resolution - limited for system sizes up to @xmath20 , and fields up to the nel transition , beyond which the pinch point broadens abruptly . </S>",
    "<S> hence up to the nel transition , and even for sizable system sizes , the main features of the structure factor are hardly distinguishable from those of the classical coulomb phase at @xmath55 , @xmath56 ( see fig .  [ f.phd](b,a-b ) ) .    the low-@xmath57 disordered phase for @xmath58 preserves therefore some fundamental features of the classical coulomb phase ( at least over a finite but extremely large range ) , but with a fundamental difference : if enough energy is transferred to the system as to resonantly excite a monopole pair , its subsequent dynamics is not diffusive ( as in the classical limit ) , but rather _ coherent _ , as monopoles hop through quantum spin flips at a rate @xmath19 ( and the temperature is @xmath59 ) . </S>",
    "<S> one could reasonably suspect that monopole excitations are fully deconfined above the pvbs state , given that their confinement energy is of the order of the pvbs gap @xmath60 ; hence in the temperature range @xmath61 the elementary excitations of the system are expected to be thermally deconfined _ spinons _ ( or coherent monopoles ) , with a finite , albeit exceedingly large correlation length thanks to the screening of the bound monopole pairs nucleated by the transverse field . </S>",
    "<S> we call this regime a thermally induced _ quantum coulomb phase _ , whose short - range properties are identical to those of a u(1 ) spin liquid phase ( the latter being realized strictly speaking only in 3@xmath4 at @xmath55 @xcite ) . in particular </S>",
    "<S> we expect spin - spin correlations to decay algebraically in the quantum coulomb phase up to a length @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the confinement length in the pvbs phase , and @xmath64 is the the average distance between _ thermally _ excited spinon pairs ; it is easy to verify that both lengths can be extremely large in the phase in question ( in particular @xmath65 is astronomically large in the low - temperature range of the quantum coulomb phase ) .     and @xmath66 , compared with the gauge mean - field theory ( gmft ) prediction . </S>",
    "<S> the vertical dashed line marks the transition from mott insulator ( mi ) to superfluid ( sf ) in the corresponding quantum rotor model ( see text).,width=226 ]    _ gauge mean - field theory . _ </S>",
    "<S> the picture of a quantum coulomb phase is further corroborated by a theoretical treatment of quantum square ice based on the recently introduced gauge mean - field theory ( gmft ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter approach formally splits the @xmath3 spin degrees of freedom into a  matter \" part - the spinon field , represented by a bosonic field of integer modulus @xmath67 - living on the centers @xmath68 of the vertices , and a gauge part - the @xmath3 spin gauge field @xmath69 , with @xmath70 - living on the sites of the lattice which are in between two vertices @xmath71 , @xmath72 ( see fig .  [ f.sketch](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> a mean - field decoupling of the gauge field with respect to the spinon field leads to the following hamiltonian , @xmath73 , @xcite with @xmath74 here @xmath75 is the conjugate ( charge ) operator to the spinon phase , @xmath76=i$ ] . in particular </S>",
    "<S> @xmath77 is readily minimized by a state with @xmath78 , reducing the spinon hamiltonian @xmath79 to a _ quantum rotor hamiltonian _ on the square lattice . within this mapping </S>",
    "<S> the transverse magnetization is simply related to the kinetic energy of the bosonic spinons , namely @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the quantum rotor hamiltonian admits a numerical solution via pimc ( see @xcite for the details ) , which allows us to compare quantitatively the predictions of gmft with the exact results coming from the pimc simulation of quantum square ice . this comparison is made in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f.sx ] , clearly showing that @xmath55 gmft is quantitatively accurate in the quantum coulomb phase , while it deviates from the numerically exact results for quantum square ice precisely when the system enters the nel phase . </S>",
    "<S> the above agreement holds despite the fact that gmft ignores the gauge - field dynamics , and its confining effect on the matter excitations - showing that such an effect is _ not _ at play in quantum square ice already at very low temperature ( @xmath81 for the data in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f.sx ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , gmft represents the low - field phase for the matter sector of quantum square ice as a bosonic _ </S>",
    "<S> mott insulator _ , with a gap corresponding to the spinon gap , and spinon pairs representing particle - hole pairs of the mott insulator . </S>",
    "<S> indeed the ground state of a mott insulator experiences quantum nucleation of bound particle - hole pairs , corresponding to the vacuum spinon - pair fluctuations in quantum square ice ( see fig .  [ f.sketch](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the result of such fluctuations is a finite kinetic energy of the spinons from eq .  , and a corresponding finite transverse magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , the elementary excitations of a bosonic mott insulator are gapped , deconfined particle - hole pairs forming a continuum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore this result further corroborates the picture in which the excitation spectrum for the matter sector of the quantum coulomb phase consists of a continuum of deconfined spinons .    _ experimental realization . _ the most prominent experimental platform for the realization of quantum square ice is represented by micro - trapped ions , which naturally implement transverse - field ising models in different planar geometries @xcite ; an alternative scheme might rely on tailored nanomagnets @xcite composed of ising - like magnetic moments . </S>",
    "<S> trapped - ion experiments typically feature dipolar interactions , while tailored nanomagnets exhibit ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida interactions , both possessing a long - range tail , and leading to a possible asymmetry between the nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor couplings ( already considered in ref .  ) . </S>",
    "<S> the long - range interactions might destabilize the pvbs phase ( while they might further stabilize the nel phase ) , but they are expected to have a marginal impact on the quantum coulomb phase as long as the low-@xmath57 symmetry breaking phase , induced by the long - range tails of the interactions , melts at a critical temperature @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that atomic physics or solid - state quantum simulators offer promising platforms for the implementation of fundamental phenomena of lattice gauge theories ( such as confinement / deconfinement transitions ) - similar ideas are currently the subject of intense theoretical investigations in the context of neutral atoms @xcite , specifically aimed at the realization of u(1 ) quantum link models @xcite .    </S>",
