    "multiaccess fading channels have been extensively studied over the years from an information - theoretic point of view @xcite-@xcite . for instance , tse and hanly @xcite",
    "have characterized the capacity region and determined the optimal resource allocation policies .",
    "it has been shown that the boundary surface points are achieved by successive decoding techniques , and each boundary point is associated with a weighted maximization of the sum rate .",
    "@xcite derived the explicit optimal power and rate allocation schemes ( similar to _ waterfilling _ ) by considering that the users are successively decoded in the same order for all channel states .",
    "for the convex capacity region , the unique decoding order was shown to be the reverse order of the priority weight .",
    "_ proved that tdma is always suboptimal in low - snr case @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "these information theoretical studies have not addressed the delay and qos constraints .    in this paper , we consider statistical qos constraints and study the achievable rate region under such constraints in multiaccess fading channels .",
    "for this analysis , we employ the concept of effective capacity @xcite , which can be seen as the maximum constant arrival rate that a given time - varying service process can support while satisfying statistical qos guarantees .",
    "effective capacity formulation uses the large deviations theory and incorporates the statistical qos constraints by capturing the rate of decay of the buffer occupancy probability for large queue lengths .",
    "the analysis and application of effective capacity in various settings has attracted much interest recently ( see e.g. , @xcite@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we here consider the scenario in which both the transmitters and the receiver have the channel side information ( csi ) .",
    "first , we characterize the rate regions when the transmitters work at fixed power .",
    "unlike the results obtained in @xcite , varying the decoding order is shown to significantly increase the achievable rate region under qos constraints . also , it is demonstrated that time sharing strategies among the vertex of the rate regions can no longer achieve the boundary surface .",
    "if we take the sum - rate throughput , or the sum effective capacity , as a measure , tdma can even achieve better performance than superposition coding with fixed decoding order in certain cases .",
    "when power adaptation is considered , we provide the optimal power allocation policy when the users are being decoded in a fixed order at the receiver side .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the system model . in section iii , effective capacity as a measure of the performance under statistical qos constraints is briefly discussed , and the _ throughput region _ under qos constraints is defined .",
    "section iv includes our main results and presents numerical results .",
    "finally , section v concludes the paper .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : model ] , we consider an uplink scenario where @xmath0 users with individual power constraints and qos constraints communicate with a single receiver .",
    "it is assumed that the transmitters generate data sequences which are divided into frames of duration @xmath1 .",
    "these data frames are initially stored in the buffers before they are transmitted over the wireless channel .",
    "the discrete - time signal at the receiver in the @xmath2 symbol duration is given by @xmath3=\\sum_{j=1}^{m}h_j[i]x_j[i]+n[i ] , \\quad i=1,2,\\ldots\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the number of users , @xmath4 $ ] and @xmath5 $ ] denote the complex - valued channel input and the fading coefficient of the @xmath6th user , respectively .",

    "first , we consider the case in which the transmitters operate at fixed power .",
    "the capacity region of this channel is given by @xcite :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 denotes the average transmitted signal - to - noise ratio of user @xmath6 , @xmath17 is a random vector comprised of the channel coefficients .",
    "as is known , there are @xmath18 vertices for the polyhedron defined in ( [ eq : capacityreg ] ) .",
    "the vertex @xmath19 corresponds to a permutation @xmath20 , or the successive decoding order at the receiver , i.e. , users are decoded in the order given by @xmath21 .",
    "the vertex is given by :    @xmath22    which also defines the maximum instantaneous service rate for user @xmath23 at the given decoding order @xmath24 .",
    "time sharing among these @xmath18 permutations yields any point on the boundary surface @xcite . as can be easily verified , due to the @xmath25 term in the expression for the capacity region ( [ eq : capacityreg ] ) , varying decoding order according to the channel state does not provide any improvement for the achievable capacity region .",
    "now , we suppose that dynamic power and rate allocation is performed according to time - variations in the channels . for a given power allocation policy @xmath26 , where @xmath27 can be viewed as a function of @xmath28 .",

    "if we define @xmath39 as the stationary queue length , then @xmath38 is the decay rate of the tail distribution of the queue length @xmath39 : @xmath40 therefore , for large @xmath41 , we have the following approximation for the buffer violation probability : @xmath42 .",

    "this case arises , for instance , if users do not have priorities over others in terms of buffer limitations or delay constraints .",
    "similar to the discussion in @xcite , finding an optimal scheduling scheme can be reduced to finding a function @xmath92 in the state space such that users are decoded in the order 1,2 if @xmath93 and users are decoded in the order 2,1 if @xmath94 . the problem in ( [ eq : maxproblem ] ) becomes @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are expressed in ( [ eq : capacityrep1 ] ) and ( [ eq : capacityrep2 ] ) at the top of the next page .",

    "moreover , we see that the suboptimal strategy can achieve almost the same rate region as the optimal strategy . this can be attributed to the fact that with the optimal strategy , the receiver can choose the decoding order according to the channel state such that the weighted sum of effective capacities , i.e. , summation of @xmath25-moment generate functions , is maximized .",

    "fig : comparisonsumrate ] that as @xmath38 increases , the curves of different strategies converge , and as @xmath38 approaches to 0 , tdma again becomes suboptimal .",

    ", we can find that instead of adapting power according to its channel state as in @xcite , the user adapts power according to its channel state normalized by the interference and the noise observed . depending on whether each user is transmitting or not , the vector space @xmath151 for @xmath28",
    "can be divided into @xmath152 disjoint regions @xmath153 .    to give an explicit idea of the power control policy",
