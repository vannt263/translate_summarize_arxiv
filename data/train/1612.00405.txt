    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are binary systems where an ordinary companion star spills matter via roche lobe overflow through an accretion disk onto a white dwarf .",
    "cvs display three types of eruptive events .",
    "classical novae ( cne ) are explosive events on white dwarfs in cvs when the accreted mass accumulates to the point where runaway thermonuclear reactions eject mass in an outgoing shell .",
    "nova eruptions typically last for a year or more and have amplitudes of @xmath17 mags .",
    "dwarf novae ( dne ) events are temporary brightenings of the accretion disk when an instability in the accretion flow causes a sudden surge of mass flowing through the disk .",
    "dwarf novae events are distinguished by durations of usually days - to - weeks and amplitudes of 1 - 4 mags .",
    "symbiotic novae are poorly understood events caused by thermonuclear burning on the white dwarfs in systems that are symbiotic stars ( where something like a red giant is orbiting a white dwarf with both hot and cool components in the spectrum ) .",
    "symbiotic novae have durations of years - to - decades and amplitudes of 1 - 6 mags .",
    "v1017 sgr is an unique cv because it shows two types of eruptive phenomena . in 1919",
    ", it had a nova eruption , with an amplitude of @xmath17.2 mags and a total duration of nearly a year .",
    "this event had much too large an amplitude to be a dn event , its total duration is greatly too long to be a dn event , and the light curve shape ( with a fading by 3 mag in 125 days ) is that of a classical nova .",
    "dwarf nova events were recorded in 1901 , 1973 , and 1991 , with amplitudes of 3 mags and total durations of a few months each .",
    "these eruptions were spectroscopically confirmed to be dwarf nova events ( vidal & rodgers 1974 ) .",
    "v1017 sgr is apparently a symbiotic star , having a reported orbital period of 5.714 days ( sekiguchi 1992 ) and spectrum of a g - type giant or sub - giant ( kraft 1964 ; harrison et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "sekiguchi ( 1992 ) claimed that v1017 sgr has a period of 5.714 days , a period that is greatly larger than almost all cvs .",
    "this implies a very large accretion disk where the roche lobe overflow is driven by the expansion of the companion star due to its nuclear evolution .",
    "the nuclear evolution drives a secular expansion of the companion star that results in a relatively high accretion rate that can support cn events with a reasonable frequency .",
    "the very large accretion disk allows for its outer regions to be sufficiently cool so as to support the dwarf nova instabilities .",
    "thus , sekiguchi s long orbital period explains why this one cv system has both cn and dn events .",
    "only one other system , gk per , is known to have both cn and dn events , and this also has the long orbital period of 2.0 days .",
    "however , sekiguchi reported the 5.714 day orbital period with just a set of 9 radial velocity measurements over a 37 day interval of observation .",
    "any such data set is not robust due to the possibilities of various errors in even one measure .",
    "( a similar case has been the early radial velocity curve for the recurrent nova t crb , with errors in one or two measures warping the conclusions and driving theorists to claims from which it has taken our field several decades to recover . )",
    "any such limited data set is also subject to many aliases , and sekiguchi points to possible periods of 0.851 and 1.212 days . for the period ,",
    "he notes that confirmation is needed .",
    "surprisingly , no follow - up radial velocities have been reported .",
    "furthermore , since cvs almost always show photometric modulations on the orbital period , sekiguchi s claimed period could be confirmed with a good light curve showing a photometric modulation on the orbital period .",
    "yet , no light curves of any type have been published for v1017 sgr , despite v1017 sgr being one of the brightest nova in quiescence , at v=13.5 or so .",
    "the orbital period of v1017 sgr is critical for all physical models , yet sekiguchi s period is problematic . in this paper , we report a large collection of magnitudes from 1897 to 2016 , and we test to see whether sekiguchi s period appears as a photometric modulation .",
    "a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) was constructed using data from five sources , see table 1 and figure 1 .",
    "column one is the band on which the data were taken , column two is the observed flux , @xmath2 , in millijanskys , column three is the flux adjusted for extinction , @xmath3 , in millijanskys , and column four is the source of the data .",
    "fluxes were corrected for interstellar dust extinction according to the equations of cardelli , clayton , and mathis ( 1989 ) .",
    "we adopted a value for e(b - v ) of 0.39 mag ( webbink et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "the sed is plotted in figure 1 .",
    "the variations of flux are consistent with the quiescent levels of the star fluctuating by as much as half a mag .",
    "this is not the classic profile of a cv , which is much brighter in the blue than the red , which decreases according to the power law with @xmath4 .",
    "instead , it closely resembles a blackbody with a peak @xmath2 near 1.0 @xmath5 m .",
    "this peak corresponds to a surface temperature near 5200 k , implying a g - type star .",
    "this surface temperature is consistent with the spectral absorption lines for which kraft ( 1964 ) gives a spectral class of g5 iiip , as confirmed by sekiguchi ( 1992 ) .    for the companion star to dominate the sed to this extent",
    ", the companion must be significantly large .",
    "a large companion forces the period to also be large , so this eliminates the possibility of a period of shorter than a day . narrowing down",
    "the possible period length greatly increases efficiency in running fourier transforms with our very long time intervals , as these shorter periods do not have to be investigated .",
    "it also eliminated some of sekiguchi s possible aliases .",

    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the rms variation of the magnitudes ( @xmath6 ) around this best fit is greatly larger than the photometric uncertainty .",
    "this observed scatter is from the usual flickering suffered by all cvs .",
    "so the 1-sigma uncertainty for use in a chi - square fit is the addition in quadrature of the small measurement error ( @xmath7 ) plus the star s intrinsic variation from flickering ( @xmath8 ) , with @xmath9 .",
    "this means that the photometric uncertainty for ccd and photoelectric measures is always negligibly small to the usual flickering noise in the star .",
    "we can only get an empirical measure of the intrinsic variance of the star , and this is simply chosen so that the reduced chi - square is near unity .",
    "this procedure means that the reduced chi - square can not be used as a criterion for the quality of the fit , but",
    "_ changes _ in the chi - square are valid measures for estimating error bars and relative confidence levels .    for the dvorak data , the fit has a minimum chi - square of 130.13 with 135 degrees of freedom .",
    "the one - sigma uncertainties are with the parameters within 1.0 of this minimum .",
    "if we set the sine wave amplitude to zero , then the chi - square is 178.6 .",
    "that is , the chi - square difference is 48.5 , which is to say that the existence of the periodicity is 7.0-sigma .",
    "some of our other various data sets have the problem that they cover a many - year time span , over which secular variations move the average level up and down by amounts comparable to the amplitude .",
    "this makes for large noise in the dft due to folding trying to line up the magnitudes taken in the faint state , all masking the real period . to solve this ,",
    "we have subtracted out the long term trend , as shown in figure 4 .",
    "the detrended light curve hovers around zero , all with a near - zero mean .",
    "this step is the only way to spot the photometric periodicity in the very long data sets that we have .    with this",
    ", we can spot several outlier magnitudes , with these being isolated and @xmath13-sigma away from any folded light curve .",
    "these are on 2442904 ( from walker ) , 2443608 ( from the ctio 0.4-m ) , and 2444826 ( from the ctio 4-m ) .",
    "these are just the usual outliers , and it is not clear whether these are some observational error ( e.g. , thin clouds ) or whether v1017 sgr was simply variable above the periodic photometric oscillation ( e.g. , with an unusually large flicker ) . we have rejected these outliers , as otherwise the dft would have substantial noise as they beat against each other .    with the detrending and the outlier rejection ,",
    "the same photometric periodicity is significant in the data sets from landolt for each filter individually , from hco , and from smarts .",
    "this gives us high confidence that we have found the real photometric period .",
    "next we performed fits for all the post - eruption b , v , and r data individually .",
    "these fits are reported in table 4 .",
    "we see that the fitted amplitude does not change significantly with band .",
    "this is consistent with normal ellipsoidal variations , where the amplitude just comes from the shape of the star in all colors .",
    "furthermore , we see that the reduced chi - square is near unity for all of the colors having the same @xmath6 , and this implies that the flickering amplitude is roughly a constant with color .",
    "normal flickering light in cvs is very blue in color , so the intrinsic variations of the star are apparently from some other mechanism .",
    "the fits for the three colors are fairly consistent in period , with an average near 2.89316 days .",
    "the amplitudes are consistent with having no color dependence , with an average value of near 0.20 mag .",
    "there is no significant evidence that the rms scatter around the best fit light curves ( 0.14 mag ) has any color dependence . with no color dependence in the detrended light curves , the best and",
    "final values will come from taking all detrended magnitudes after the 1919 cn eruption .",
    "for all 360 b , v , and r magnitudes from 1923 - 2015 , the dft returns a single dominant period of 2.893144 days .",
    "our chi - square fit ( see table 4 ) returns the same period .",
    "the period is accurate to 5 parts - per - million .",
    "we can fold all the magnitudes to see the shape of the light curve . to see the folded light curve in quiescence ,",
    "we have not included any magnitude from 1901 , 1919 , 1973 , or 1991 . with the star s quiescent level varying around on decadal time scales ,",
    "the scatter in a straight fold would be large , so we have used the detrended light curves instead .",
    "we do not have enough data from any one band to make a clean light curve , so we have combined the detrended magnitudes from b , v , and r bands .",
    "like for many cvs , the star s intrinsic flickering makes for scatter that is comparable to the ellipsoidal effects , with this serving to hide the underlying variations .",
    "the solution is to phase average the magnitudes , and we will do this in bins of size 0.05 in phase . with this , the folded and phase - binned light curves for v1017 sgr in b and v are presented in figure 5 for a period of 2.893145 days .",
    "= 2.893145 days .",
    "this light curve is for all post - eruption detrended magnitudes in b , v , and r , all averaged within 0.05 phase bins .",
    "we see an apparent sine wave with a period equal to half the orbital period , pointing to ellipsoidal variations .",
    "such is expected when the optical light curve is dominated by the companion star . ]    given sekiguchi s radial velocity curve and the likelihood that the light curve will be dominated by the companion s ellipsoidal variations , the orbital period is twice the photometric period , or @xmath10=5.786290@xmath00.000032 .",
    "cvs have mass transfer and other effects that make for a slow and steady period change ( @xmath11 measured in units of days per day ) while in quiescence between nova eruptions .",
    "we have found that such a steady period change can be quite large for the recurrent nova t crb , which also has a red giant companion star and cn eruptions .",
    "so we have run further fits with all the 360 de - trended post - eruption magnitudes in b , v , and r ( see table 4 ) .",
    "we do find a marginally significant steady period change . while the existence of the @xmath11 is not required , it is expected and it is the best representation of the data . with this ,",
    "the times of the photometric minima are jd @xmath12 ) , for e being an integer . around the start of march 1919 ,",
    "the time of minimum is jd 2422018.064@xmath00.150 .",
    "our group has been vigorously pursuing the measurement of pre - eruption orbital periods ( @xmath13 ) of novae , so that , when combined with accurate post - eruption orbital periods ( @xmath14 ) , we measure the _ change _ of the period across the eruption ( @xmath15=@xmath16 ) .",
    "this measure provides an accurate model - free measure of the mass ejected by the nova event ( an otherwise very - poorly known quantity ) , with implications for nova physics and for models of cv evolution ( this alone refutes the hibernation model ) .",
    "now , for v1017 sgr , we have just derived a parts - per - million post - eruption orbital period , and we have hco data that shows the orbital variations from 1907 to 1916 .",
    "( the magnitude from 1897 can not be used because we do not know the trend for detrending . )",
    "so we have tried to pull out the pre - eruption orbital period .",
    "given the substantial photometric modulation on half the orbital period visible from 1923 - 2015 , we can strongly expect that v1017 sgr should show substantial photometric modulation on half the orbital period from 1907 - 1916 .",
    "for the 15 b - band magnitudes from 1907 - 1916 , the dft shows many nearly equal peaks , as appropriate for the small number of points .",
    "these many peaks are simply caused by the high points and low points randomly beating each other to produce spurious aliases over a very wide range of periods .",
    "these aliases are certainly not physical , and we can recognize this by them requiring an impossibly large period change across the 1919 cn eruption",
    ". based on theory ( see schaefer 2011 ) plus our many well - measured @xmath15 values ( now for 5 cn eruptions and for 4 recurrent nova eruptions ) , we know that @xmath17 must be smaller than a 0.1% change . for v1017 sgr , this means that any apparent periodicity outside the range 2.8902.896 days must be a spurious alias .",
    "we are strongly expecting a significant dft peak inside the period range 2.8902.896 days that is the real half - period of v1017 sgr .",
    "the dft of the 15 hco pre - eruption de - trended b magnitudes has a high peak at a period of 2.893877 days .",
    "the chi - square fit to a sine wave for this fourier peak is given in table 4 .",
    "we see that the amplitude is larger than the post - eruption amplitude , and the rms scatter around this best fit is somewhat smaller .",
    "we show the folded light curve in figure 6 , and it looks good .",
    "we can test the significance of the sine wave periodicity by comparing the chi - square values for the best fit case ( 12.14 ) versus the zero - amplitude case ( 43.96 ) .",
    "the difference in chi - square is 31.82 , and this corresponds to a 5.6-sigma confidence level in the significance of the periodic modulation .",
    "so even with only 15 magnitudes with tenth - magnitude variations , we have a highly significant photometric modulation at the half - orbital period .",
    "the change in the photometric period is -0.000704@xmath00.000170 days , while the change in the orbital period is -0.001408@xmath00.000340 days .",
    "that is , the orbital period got _",
    "shorter _ across the 1919 cn eruption by @xmath17=-243@xmath057 parts - per - million .",
    "this large of a change in the orbital period is startling for theory , so we have to carefully test whether the orbital period change across the eruption is significant , and we have to run other tests as we can .",
    "one test is to see whether the pre - eruption ephemeris extrapolates to a yield an epoch around the 1919 eruption that is consistent with that derived from the post - eruption ephemeris .",
    "that is , the period can not have any jumps across the eruption , which is to say that the @xmath18 curve must be continuous . from the post - eruption fit , we derived a minimum time of jd 2422018.064@xmath00.150 . from the pre - eruption fit",
    ", we derive an epoch of jd 2422018.263@xmath00.168 .",
    "the time difference is 0.199@xmath00.225 .",
    "that is , the the pre - eruption ephemeris does well match the post - eruption ephemeris to within 1-sigma . if the pre - eruption period is spurious , then we would expect a random 84% chance that there would be a mismatch .",
    "thus , this test provides a small amount of confidence in the period .    a second test is to examine the fit and folded light curve for the 15 pre - eruption magnitudes as based on the post - eruption ephemeris .",
    "the folded light curve is shown in figure 7 .",
    "the post - eruption ephemeris is obviously horrible .",
    "the poor folded light curve is not just a matter of shifting the epoch , as there is a large rms scatter at all phases , and this is the symptom of a bad period .",
    "this demonstrates that there must be some significant period change across the 1919 cn eruption .",
    "a third test is to see whether the 1897 measure fits into this best fit .",
    "the magnitude in 1897 was not de - trended because it is isolated in time at a decade before any other magnitude , so we have no confident and independent way to know how the trend goes in 1897 .",
    "still , looking at the b magnitudes on the far left of figure 4 , any plausible trend line would fall below , likely substantially below the 1897 measure .",
    "this would give a weak test that the the phase of the 1897 point should be in the bright half of the curve ( i.e. , phase between 0.25 and 0.75 ) , and should likely be near the phase 0.5 around the peak brightness .",
    "the phase of the 1897 point is 0.62 , which agrees with the expectation that the period is real .",
    "at worst , this test is only a 50% test , yet with the period having passed this weak test , we still do get some small amount of extra confidence .",
    "the linear fit for the pre - eruption data was presented as a simple case to define the problem .",
    "we should perform fits that make use of two more physical facts that we have established from the post - eruption data .",
    "first , we know from the post - eruption fit that the pre - eruption ephemeris must pass through jd 2422018.064@xmath00.150 .",
    "second , we should be using the @xmath11 in the pre - eruption fit , and this @xmath11 value should be the same as that for the post - eruption fits .",
    "this new fit would set the epoch to jd 2422018.064 , @xmath11 to 1.19@xmath1910@xmath20 days / day , and keep the amplitude at 0.412 mag .",
    "this fit is summarized in table 4 .",
    "the folded light curve is virtually identical to that in figure 6 except with a 0.04 phase shift to the right .",
    "the pre - eruption period has changed substantially from the post - eruption period . with the @xmath11 , we have to be careful to compare the periods immediately before and after the eruption . with this , @xmath13=2.893685@xmath00.000060 , @xmath14=2.893054@xmath00.000015 , and @xmath15=0.000631@xmath00.000062 days .",
    "this corresponds to a 10.2-sigma confidence level for the period having suffered a change across the cn eruption .",
    "so far , our fits have treated the time intervals before and after 1919 ( mostly ) independently .",
    "but the physical constraints of the situation forces the lack of any jumps in the epochs of zero - phase , and this means that the pre- and post - eruption intervals should be connected with a joint fit . in an @xmath18 curve and in the ephemeris of superior conjunction , this can be represented as a broken parabola .",
    "that is , there will be one epoch around the start of march 1919 , the ephemeris after 1919 will be some parabola , and the ephemeris before 1919 will be a different parabola .",
    "the @xmath11 before the eruption is poorly constrained by the data , so we will simply presume the obvious default case that the steady period change remains constant over all times in quiescence . with this , we then have four fit parameters for the period ; the epoch of a superior conjunction around the start of march 1919 , the post - eruption orbital period , the pre - eruption orbital period , and @xmath11 .",
    "our final fit will be one over - all fit , from 1907 to 2015 , with de - trended magnitudes for b , v , and r. as one joint fit , we ensure that the connection in 1919 is made exactly .",
    "we have 375 magnitudes .",
    "the final over - all joint fits are presented in the last two lines of table 4 .",
    "these best fit parameters are for the photometric periodicity , with the epoch being the time of the star at minimum brightness .",
    "the 1-sigma error bars are calculated as the maximal deviation from the reported best parameter , for any combination of the other parameters , for which the resultant chi - square is 1.00 larger than the minimum chi - square .",
    "the orbital periodicity is twice the photometric periodicity , while the @xmath11 is four times larger . to be explicit ,",
    "here are the pair of ephemeris equations , @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an integer .",
    "the uncertainties on these coefficients can be taken from table 4 , although the uncertainty for the periods are doubled and @xmath11 are quadrupled .",
    "the epoch in these equations corresponds to the time of the deepest of the two minimum in the folded light curve ( cf .",
    "figure 8) .",
    "the orbital phase for any time will be the fraction of the interval between two adjacent epochs of zero phase .",
    "these orbital phases are listed for all observations in table 3 .",
    "these orbital phases have also been used to create a folded light curve , as shown in figure 8 .",
    "we see photometric maxima near phase 0.25 and 0.75 .",
    "photometric minima are near phase 0.00 and 0.50 , with the zero - phase minimum being significantly deeper .",
    "this folded light curve is characteristic of ellipsoidal modulation with some sort of an eclipse at near zero phase .",
    "= 5.787616 days . this light curve is for all post - eruption detrended magnitudes in b , v , and r , all averaged within 0.05 phase bins .",
    "the 1-sigma error bars of each point are roughly 0.03 mag .",
    "we see an ellipsoidal modulation on the orbital period , with the minimum at 0.0 phase being deeper than at 0.5 phase .",
    "apparently , the accretion disk is partially eclipsing the companion star . ]",
    "the critical point is that is that the photometric modulation has @xmath13=2.893808@xmath00.000136 days ( for just before the 1919 eruption ) , @xmath14=2.893019@xmath00.000039 days ( for just after the 1919 eruption ) , and so @xmath15= -0.000789@xmath00.000142 . with the 1-sigma range in",
    "parameter space being moderately correlated , the real 1-sigma error bar for @xmath15 is moderately larger , so @xmath15= -0.000789@xmath00.000176 .",
    "the smallest chi - square for parameters that can return a zero period change is 32.89 larger than the minimum , which points to the period change as being 5.7-sigma . in all cases ,",
    "the existence of the period change is highly significant .",
    "the period has changed across the 1919 cn eruption with @xmath17 equal to -273@xmath061 parts - per - million .",
    "the orbital period _ decreased _ across the 1919 cn eruption .",
    "this result is startling for nova theorists .",
    "the reason is that the change in period should be comparable to @xmath24 ( prialnik and shara 1986 , schaefer 2011 ) , and this should be greatly smaller than the observed @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , for v1017 sgr , the ejection of mass can only make for a period _",
    "increase_. so we have a problem , at least to the extent that modern nova theory is missing some large evolutionary effect , having no glimmer of understanding for large period decreases .    this huge period _ decrease _ is _ not _ startling to our group here at louisiana state university , because we have now measured @xmath17 across 5 other _ classical _ nova eruptions , and three of those five also had huge period decreases . in particular , rr pic , hr del , and qz aur had @xmath17 values between -288 and -451 parts - per - million shortenings of the period across their cn eruption , and these changes are all measured with high confidence and high accuracy .",
    "( dq her also suffered a highly significant period decrease , but only at the 4.8 parts - per - million level . )",
    "the cn bt mon has an observed period increase across its 1939 eruption ( schaefer and patterson 1983 ) , and this was part of the original motivation for the hibernation model and this also shows that not all novae have their period decreasing .",
    "so , our new result for v1017 sgr is merely the fifth case ( out of six measured ) with a period _ decrease _ , and is the fourth case ( out of six measured ) with a period _ decrease _ by more than 200 parts - per - million .",
    "we only have 15 useable pre - eruption magnitudes , each with a photometric accuracy of around 0.09 mag , so some willful researchers might think to deny or ignore our result . such would be the easiest way to solve the theory problem . still , despite the low numbers of pre - eruption plates , our period change is of high confidence , and has passed a variety of additional tests : ( 1 ) our chi - square fits show that the standard significance of the existence of a sinusoidal modulation is at the 5.6-sigma confidence level in the pre - eruption data .

    ", we found that we can measure the post - eruption orbital period to parts - per - million accuracy . with this , we then realized that we actually have enough pre - eruption data that we can measure the photometric modulation and determine the orbital period to useful accuracy . startlingly ( for theorists ) , we find that the orbital period has decreased across the 1919 cn eruption by -273@xmath063 parts - per - million .",
    "this is a result where the change in period is significant at the 5.7-sigma confidence level and has passed various tests , so we consider it strongly proven .",
    "this is just our fourth example of a huge period decrease across cn eruptions , so it is only surprising for nova theorists .",
    "for various analysis questions , we need to know the mass of the white dwarf ( @xmath25 ) and the mass of the companion star ( @xmath26 ) , and these are tied in to the radial velocity curve of sekiguchi ( 1992 ) .",
    "we have a variety of constraints and results :    with our new ephemeris , we have phased up sekiguchi s nine radial velocity measures and fit them to a sine wave .",
    "we find a systemic velocity of 15 km / s and an amplitude of 90 km / s .",
    "the epoch when the giii companion star ( for which the lines are measured ) is at superior conjunction ( i.e. , the accretion disk is directly in front of the companion ) is when the star s velocity is zero ( relative to the systemic velocity ) and running negative ( i.e. , the companion starts to come towards the earth ) . from our fit ,",
    "the phase of superior conjunction is 0.03 .",
    "the error bars on these fit values are unclear because the fitted sine wave has a very large reduced chi - square , so the real uncertainties must be greatly larger then tabulated by sekiguchi .    with our period",
    ", we calculate that the system has a mass function of 0.44 m@xmath27 .",
    "this is a lower limit on @xmath25 .",
    "the mass function depends on @xmath25 , the mass ratio @xmath28 ( @xmath26/@xmath25 ) , and the orbital inclination ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "@xmath25 must be larger than 0.6 m@xmath27 for a field white dwarf , and should be less than something like 1.2 m@xmath27 because no recurrent nova events are seen in 119 years despite a high apparent accretion rate .",
    "our mass function is a large fraction of any @xmath25 value , so that means that the inclination must be fairly edge - on and the mass ratio can not be too large .",
    "extreme limits on the various parameters are @xmath300.45 m@xmath27 , @xmath3146 , and @xmath320.66 .",
    "a low @xmath26 is incompatible with the companion being the size of a yellow giant star , so we expect that there must at least be some sort of a normal core , so @xmath330.6 m@xmath27 or so .",
    "there will then be a limit on the mass ratio , where @xmath340.5 or so . with this",
    ", we are forced into the white dwarf being near the maximal mass and the inclination being near edge on ( i.e. , eclipsing ) . with our lower limit on the companion mass",
    ", we have that the the white dwarf must be @xmath11.07 m@xmath27 and that the inclination must be @xmath170 . for the extreme case with @xmath351.2 m@xmath27 and @xmath29=90",
    ", we have @xmath26=0.79 m@xmath27 , and @xmath28=0.66 . for a middle - of - the - range case with @xmath351.1 m@xmath27 and @xmath29=80 , we have @xmath26=0.60 m@xmath27 , and @xmath28=0.55",
    ".    we can now derive the system geometry , and we ll adopt the middle - of - the - range case .",
    "we find that the separation between the centers of the companion star and the white dwarf is 16.1 r@xmath27 , and that the radius of the companion star s roche lobe is 5.3 r@xmath27 .",
    "this means that the companion star will eclipse the central white dwarf for inclination @xmath172 , while it will eclipse parts of the accretion disk to much lower inclinations .",
    "this means that in all cases we should see some sort of an eclipse . and",
    "this is consistent with the light curve seen in figure 8 .",
    "we have found that the phase of the superior conjunction of the companion star is close to the phase of the deepest of the two minima in the folded light curve ( see figure 8) .",
    "this means that the system is dimmed more by the disk covering up the companion star than by the companion star covering up the same area of the disk . for detached eclipsing binaries ,",
    "the rule is that the deeper minima should be associated with the hotter star being eclipsed . for v1017 sgr",
    ", the companion star has a surface temperature of 5200 k , while the outer parts of the disk must have a typical temperature of @xmath3610,000 k ( so that dn events can occur ) and the inner parts are even hotter .",
    "so we do not understand the depths of the minima in the folded light curve .",
    "the companion star ( 5200 k and 5.3r@xmath27 ) is certainly an evolved star above the main sequence .",
    "we are not clear whether it should be more correctly called a sub - giant star or a giant star . in all cases with no binary interaction ,",
    "the progenitor would have to come from a star with a main sequence mass of roughly 2 m@xmath27 to get to that position on the hr diagram .",
    "further , the progenitor must have spent most of its main sequence lifetime with a mass @xmath11 m@xmath27 so as to start evolving off the main sequence in the age of the milky way .",
    "but there must have been binary evolution when the now - white - dwarf star became a giant with a size larger than the current binary system .",
    "this interaction could have substantially tightened the orbit , reducing the orbital period down to 5.78 days .",
    "this interaction inevitably must have involved some substantial mass transfer onto the now - companion star . during the cv phase",
    ", mass will transfer from the companion to the white dwarf , with a lot of this material then being blown off as ejecta from the cn eruptions .",
    "as above , the companion star appears to be somewhere between 0.6 m@xmath27 and 0.79 m@xmath27 .",
    "so apparently , the companion has net lost something like 0.2 m@xmath27 or more during its complex binary evolution .",
    "we can now estimate and limit the distance , @xmath37 , to v1017 sgr :    with our sed and @xmath10 , we can derive a blackbody distance to the giant companion .",
    "previously , we have done this with two independent methods for five recurrent novae ( schaefer 2010 ) . both methods key off the size of the companion star , as derived from the orbital period .",
    "the radius of the companion must equal to the radius of its roche lobe , and this comes from kepler s law and the usual roche lobe geometry .",
    "for this , there is a weak dependence on the star masses .",
    "we adopt 1.1 m@xmath27 for the white dwarf and 0.6 m@xmath27 for the companion star .",
    "then , with a 5.786 day period , the companion star has a radius of 5.3 r@xmath27 .    our first method for the blackbody distance works through the absolute bolometric magnitude .",
    "with the usual boltzmann equation , as scaled from our sun , the absolute bolometric magnitude of the 5200 k companion with radius 5.3 r@xmath27 is + 1.6 mag . for @xmath38=0.39 mag ,",
    "the v - band extinction is 1.2 mag . with the observed v magnitude equal to 13.5 mag",
    ", the extinction - corrected v magnitude is 12.3 . for a g5 @xmath39 star ,",
    "the bolometric correction is -0.3 mag , so the companion star has a bolometric magnitude of 12.0 mag .",
    "the distance modulus is then 12.0 - 1.6 = 10.4 mag , which corresponds to 1210 parsecs .",
    "this distance is likely to be slightly on the low side , because the accretion disk must account for some 10% or so of the v - band flux ( so as to account for the flickering ) .",
    "the uncertainty is dominated by the variation in the v magnitude and the error in determining the companion s surface temperature from the sed taken at different times , for which we estimate an error bar of @xmath0200 pc .",
    "so , our first method gives a @xmath37=1210@xmath0200 pc .",
    "our second distance estimate uses a different route to get the blackbody distance of the companion star , this time through the flux at the peak of the sed .",
    "the sed ( see figure 1 ) peaks at around 1.0 @xmath5 m ( 3@xmath1910@xmath40 hz ) with extinction corrected @xmath3 of near 70 mjy .",
    "the flux at the surface of the star at the peak is determined only by the blackbody temperature from the peak position , and this will suffer geometric dilution as the distance gets further from the star s surface . this flux will diminish to that observed at a distance of 1270 pc . by varying the inputs over their plausible ranges , the error bar on the distance is roughly 300 pc .",
    "so our second distance estimate returns 1270@xmath0300 pc .",
    "our first two distance estimates are really just one , with these two different paths and different inputs all being equivalent , yet it still provides some cross - checking to demonstrate reliability and uncertainties .    our third distance estimate is simply from the galactic position of v1017 sgr , with galactic latitude of -9.1and galactic longitude of 4.5 . with coordinates like this ,",
    "v1017 sgr looks to be in the inner bulge of our milky way , with a distance of around 6000 - 10000 parsecs .",
    "we all understand that v1017 sgr could well be outside this range , but @xmath418000 pc is certainly the first guess .",
    "our fourth distance estimate is from the observed systemic radial velocity of + 15 km / s ( sekiguchi 1992 ) .",
    "unfortunately , by being close to the galactic center , this radial velocity is much as expected for stars at all distances along the line of sight .",
    "so this fourth distance estimate method returns no useful information .",
    "our fifth distance estimate is from the observed extinction with @xmath38=0.39 mag ( webbink et al .",
    "the total extinction through the whole milky way galaxy along that line of sight has @xmath38=0.23 mag ( schlafly & finkbeiner 2011 ) .",
    "this means that v1017 sgr is out past most of the galaxy s dust . for a galactic latitude of -9.1 , and for most of the dust being within 200 pc of the galactic plane ,",
    "this sets a lower limit of @xmath421200 pc .",
    "this limit has substantial uncertainties , hard to quantify , due to the clumpiness of clouds along the line of sight .",
    "our sixth distance comes from the peak magnitude for the 1919 eruption .",
    "the distance modulus to the nova can be taken as @xmath43-@xmath44 , where @xmath43 is the extinction corrected magnitude at peak brightness and @xmath44 is the absolute magnitude at peak brightness in the b - band .",
    "we have an approximate extinction to v1017 sgr as @xmath45=1.6 mag .",
    "let us start with an extreme upper limit on the distance , with @xmath46 mag ( downes & duerbeck 2000 ; and kalsiwili et al .",
    "2011 ) and the faintest possible peak at b=6.4 mag .",
    "with this , the distance is @xmath479000 pc . but",
    "v1017 sgr is certainly far from this limit , partly because only rare nova peak at such a high luminosity and partly because the linear part of the observed light curve shows that the time of peak observed brightness ( with @xmath48 mag ) is far from the peak .",
    "so this distance limit is really @xmath37@xmath499000 pc . for an extreme lower limit on @xmath37",
    ", we can push @xmath44 to -6 mag and we can extend the eruption light curve ( see figure 2 ) early enough in time so that it would be missed due to the sun only to peak around 2 mag or so . with this , @xmath37@xmath50200 pc .",
    "these extreme limits are not useful .",
    "but we can get a reasonable best estimate .",
    "most nova peak around absolute magnitude -8@xmath01 , while the best matching from s - class light curves ( see strope at al 2010 ) to figure 2 suggests that the real peak was 4.5@xmath01.0 mag .",
    "this gives an extinction - corrected distance modulus of 10.9@xmath01.4 mag , or a distance of 1500 pc with a range of 800 - 2900 pc .    in all , only the blackbody distances offer any accuracy or reliability , with the other estimates all being consistent .",
    "hence , we are concluding that the distance to v1017 sgr is 1240@xmath0200 pc .",
    "the critical surprise is that we have strong evidence that the orbital period _ decreased _ by -273@xmath061 parts - per - million across the 1919 cn eruption .",
    "this has many problems and implications .",
    "the key problem is to explain how v1017 sgr can possibly have such a large period decrease .",
    "three effects are known that can change the period across a nova eruption ( schaefer 2011 , see appendix b ) : ( 1 ) the first effect is simply the loss of mass by the white dwarf due to the mass in the ejected shell .",
    "this effect can only _ increase _ the period .",
    "so this can not explain the observed period decrease .",
    "further , this effect is much smaller in size than observed .",
    "for example , for a large shell with an ejected mass of @xmath51 m@xmath27 , the fractional period change ( @xmath17 ) will be close to 2 parts - per - million .",
    "( 2 ) the second effect will be from the loss of angular momentum by the companion star as it moved in the ` common envelope ' of the ejected shell by means of dynamical friction ( livio 1991 ) .",
    "this will necessarily decrease the orbital period , which is at least in the right direction .",
    "however , this will necessarily be a small fraction of the first effect in size .",
    "so the sum of the first two effect must always be to _ increase _ the orbital period ( schaefer 2011 , eqn .",
    "( 3 ) the third known effect is material in the ejected shell being forced to corotate with the white dwarf due to being entrained in its magnetic field for the initial part of its ejection , with this carrying away rotational angular momentum that then gets transferred to cause a loss of the orbital angular momentum ( martin et al . 2011 ) .",
    "this effect has a strong dependence on the mass ratio , where the total period change can be negative only for @xmath320.4 or so , while the required effect ( for our observed @xmath17 and for even @xmath51 m@xmath27 ejected ) requires a mass ratio of @xmath28=0.002 even for high magnetic fields . for v1017 sgr",
    ", we always have @xmath340.5 , so this third effect can never make for such a large period decrease . in summary for all three known period change mechanisms for v1017 sgr , the sum of all three known effects will result in a small _ increase _ of the period across the eruption .",
    "this is a substantial problem for nova theorists .",
    "but we have found the exact same problem for dq her , rr pic , hr del , and qz aur , and these cases are all with very high confidence levels that the periods _ decreased _ across their cn eruptions .",
    "so v1017 sgr is simply the fifth case of a confidently measured period decrease .",
    "we have still not even heard of any vague idea expressed to explain the large period decreases .",
    "this is now a strong challenge to the completeness of nova theories .",
    "the large period decrease provides a larger challenge for the theory of cvs in that this unknown mechanism is shortening the orbital period at a faster rate than the two known mechanisms ( gravitational radiation and magnetic breaking ) , so this unknown mechanism is dominating the evolution of four - out - of - six cn systems .",
    "that is , for these four systems , the period changes by @xmath36@xmath52 for each eruption , so it will only take @xmath363000 eruptions before a simple extrapolation has the period going to zero .",
    "while such an extrapolation will not be exact , it does set the time scale for the lifetime of the cv .",
    "for v1017 sgr , given the crudely known @xmath25 and eruption amplitude , we can estimate that the inter - eruption time interval is of order @xmath53 years ( yaron et al . 2005 ) .",
    "so v1017 sgr apparently has a lifetime of order @xmath54 years as driven by this unknown mechanism .",
    "this time scale is greatly faster than the evolutionary time scale for the red giant companion star .",
    "this fast lifetime has nothing to do with the evolved nature of the companion star , because rr pic , hr del , and qz aur are ordinary cne with low mass companions near the main sequence . for now , the unknown mechanism is dominating the evolution of at least the majority of cn systems , its applicability to other systems is unknown , and the implications for evolution have not been thought out .",
    "the period decrease of v1017 sgr provides a counter - example to the basic mechanism of the hibernation model ( shara et al .",
    "that is , the hibernation model requires that the companion star separates slightly from the white dwarf , with this increased orbital period driving the entire hibernation phenomenon .",
    "furthermore , hibernation has the post - eruption nova slowly fading over the decades , as the irradiation effects diminish , with the system dimming into a hibernating state .",
    "but v1017 sgr fails both required predictions of hibernation , as its period decreases and its brightness is not fading .",
    "so v1017 sgr provides a proof that hibernation does not work , at least for this one nova system .    with a relatively large period decrease across the 1919 cn eruption ,",
    "the size of the roche lobe will decrease .",
    "suddenly the point for spilling matter from the companion star is pushed deeper into the stellar atmosphere . with this , the accretion rate should increase suddenly across the eruption .",
    "we can calculate the decrease in the roche lobe associated with the period change .",
    "this will be a weak function of the changing masses of the white dwarf and the companion star , as well as of the mass of the ejected shell . for",
    "@xmath51 m@xmath27 ejected , @xmath25=1.1 m@xmath27 , and @xmath26=0.60 m@xmath27 , the size of the companion star s roche lobe shrinks by 610 km .",
    "this should be compared against the atmospheric scale height of the giant star s atmosphere . for normal composition , 5.3 r@xmath27 radius , and a surface temperature of 5200 k ,",
    "the atmospheric scale height is 5200 km . by moving the edge of the roche lobe 610 km deeper in such an atmosphere ,",
    "the density of the atmosphere at the roche surface will increase by 17% .",
    "so the strong prediction is that for the observed period change , there should be an increase in the accretion rate , and hence in the accretion disk brightness by 13% from before 1919 to after the end of the eruption .",
    "this corresponds to close to 0.13 mag change .",
    "this is within the variations displayed in figure 4 . with the companion star dominating the optical light , even in the b band ,",
    "the expected systematic change in magnitude due to the period change will be greatly smaller than 0.13 mag .",
    "thus , we conclude that the expected change in brightness across the 1919 cn event from this mechanism should be too small to measure .",
    "v1017 sgr is a nearly unique cv that displays both cn and dn eruptions .",
    "the only previous work has been scattered photometric measures , some spectra showing absorption lines for a g5 iii star , and nine points in a radial velocity curve .",
    "sekiguchi s reported period of 5.714 days was acknowledged to be dubious and ambiguous . and",
    "no one had ever followed up to test this period either photometrically or spectroscopically . in this paper",
    "we report large numbers of new photometric measures aimed at testing sekiguchi s claimed period .",
    "we find that the sed is well represented by a 5200 k blackbody , which is the giant companion star dominating over the accretion disk .",
    "the 1919 event was certainly a s - class cn , with the peak some weeks before the discovery on 11 march 1919 ( as it was near solar conjunction at the time ) with a likely peak magnitude of 4.5@xmath01.0 ( certainly between 6.4 and 2.0 ) , for a total amplitude of 10.5 mag or so .",
    "the nova system showed a pre - eruption rise of 0.6 mag from 1907.5 to 1916.5 , but it is problematic as to whether this is causally connected to the cn event .",
    "three dn events were seen in 1901 , 1973 , and 1991 , all with effectively identical light curves .",
    "their total durations were 0.5 years each , the amplitude was close to 3 mags , while the rise and fall was symmetric and roughly triangular in shape .",
    "v1017 sgr is the _ only _ known cn that displays dn events _ before _ the cn event . the quiescent level after the cn event ( from 1923 to 2016 ) shows no systematic decline , but rather displays 0.3 - 0.6 mag variations on the decadal time scale . we do not understand how the system can vary by so much in quiescence ( with equal amplitudes in bvri colors ) when the light is dominated by a presumably constant star of fixed radius .    for the post - eruption magnitudes",
    ", we find a highly significant photometric periodicity 2.893145@xmath00.000016 days , with a small @xmath11 .",
    "given the dominance of the companion light so that the photometric modulation must be dominated by the ellipsoidal effect , and the sekiguchi radial velocities , the true orbital period must be twice the photometric period . when folded on the orbital period , the light curve alternates between deep and shallow minima , with the unusually - large accretion disk eclipsing the companion star during the deeper minima . with the orbital period being twice the photometric period , we see that sekiguchi got the correct period , even if with poor accuracy .",
    "this orbital period is one of the longest amongst all known cvs .",
    "this requires that the companion star have a size of close to 5.3 r@xmath27 , and certainly having evolved off the main sequence .",
    "this implies that the current accretion is being driven by the evolutionary expansion of the companion star , and not by some angular momentum loss mechanism .",
    "this also requires that the accretion disk around the white dwarf be exceptionally large . in this case",
    ", the outer regions of the disk can be cool enough for the dn instability to occur , despite the relatively high accretion rate that is needed for the cn event .",
    "so the very long orbital period explains why v1017 sgr is the only cv with a dn event before a cn eruption .    with the orbital period and the sed",
    ", we derive a blackbody distance to the companion star to be 1240@xmath0200 parsecs .",
    "this relatively nearby distance plus the relatively high luminosity giant companion star gives the reason why v1017 sgr is one of the brightest ex - nova in the sky .",
    "we have 15 useable magnitudes from before the 1919 eruption , and these give a periodicity with a good looking folded light curve , and the best fit connects with the post - eruption ephemeris at the time of the cn event .",
    "the pre - eruption period is different from the post - eruption period at the 5.7-sigma confidence level .",
    "the period decreased by -273@xmath061 parts - per - million .",
