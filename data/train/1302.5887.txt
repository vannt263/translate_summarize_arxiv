    "from shortly after the first quasar was found until the present , considerable effort has been spent in obtaining samples to investigate their luminosity distribution as a function of redshift , known as the luminosity function ( lf ) . the lf is very important because its shape and evolution provide constraints on the nature of activity and the cosmic evolution of quasars / active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . up to now",
    "many statistical approaches have been proposed to investigate the lfs .",
    "these include parametric techniques which assume analytical form for the lfs , and non - parametric methods which usually need binning the data .    among the non - parametric methods ,",

    "@xcite presented an improved method ( hereafter the @xmath1 method ) of constructing the binned lf . according to the result based on a monte carlo simulation ,",
    "the authors believed their method is superior to the @xmath0 method in many aspects .",
    "however , their simulation was performed using a luminosity function which is unchanging with redshift ( i.e. no evolution ) and a single flux limit .",
    "the assumption of no evolution is too particular to be able to represent more general situations .",
    "furthermore , they focused on the situation of single sample ( a single flux limit ) , and the discussion on multiple samples was not sufficient . in this paper",

    "we use a combined sample simulated by a monte carlo method to further compare the @xmath0 and @xmath1 methods .",

    "the input model lfs take values of @xmath89 and are shown as dashed lines .    as expected from section 2.3 ,",
    "the two methods give identical and ideal estimate for the high luminosity points of each redshift interval .",
    "however , for the low luminosity bins of all the redshift intervals both methods give smaller estimate than the input model .",
    "this situation is especially serious for the @xmath0 method . for the lowest luminosity bins of the @xmath90",

    "the above results are not in completely agreement with @xcite .",
    "their simulation showed that @xmath5 is always a good representation of the input model over the total luminosity range .",
    "this is because their simulation was performed using a lf which is unchanging with redshift ( i.e. no evolution ) .",
    "once the lf is evolving with redshift , the classical binned methods will unlikely give an ideal estimate over the total luminosity range . in fig .",

    "we assume each sub - bin is small enough and the four - volume involved is unit .",
    "the number noted in each sub - bin represents the source number .",
    "thus the variation of number across sub - bins indicates how the density changes along luminosity and redshift .",
    "according to the @xmath1 method , the density ( i.e. , lf ) at the center of bin2 and bin3 is estimated as @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively .",
    "this is in agreement with the input model density at @xmath93 ( see fig.9 ( b ) ) .",
    "bin1 is divided into two parts by the flux limit curve @xmath2 .",
    "owing to the positive evolution of density along redshift and decline of density along luminosity , the left part of bin1 probably contains more sources than the right part .",
    "however , the sources in left part can not be observed because the flux is limited .",
    "therefor , according to the @xmath1 method , the density at the center of bin1 is estimated as @xmath94 ( the total source number in right part of bin1 divided by its four - volume ) which is significantly smaller than the input model density . it can be expected that the more intensely the lf evolves with redshift , the more significant the error of @xmath5 for bin1 is .",

    "( a ) : the redshift intervals are chosen arbitrarily .",
    "( b ) : the redshift intervals are determined by the intersecting points of luminosity grid - line and flux limit curve .",
    "( c ) : the luminosity intervals are determined by the intersecting points of redshift grid - line and flux limit curve .",
    "the shaded regions represent the surveyed regions .",
    "the surveyed regions only occupy very small parts of the faint end bins in ( a ) , this probably lead them to enclose very few objects which gather at the right margins .",
    "this issue is avoided in ( b ) and ( c ) . ]",
    "the accuracy of binned lf also depends on how the redshift and luminosity bins are divided .",
    "the bins are supposed to be small enough , but can not be too small to include only a few objects . in general , the equal intervals of luminosity are used , e.g. @xmath95 or @xmath96 . while in the literature , the redshift intervals are commonly chosen something arbitrarily , e.g. @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 ; @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 etc .",
    "we believe this may lead the bins located at the faint end to enclose very few objects inside(see fig .",
    "10 ( a ) ) and cause bias with small number statistics .",
    "moreover , in these bins , objects necessarily gather at the right margins ( see fig .",
    "thus the area equal to [ @xmath49 of these bins will be much larger than that of the surveyed regions , causing a significantly small estimate of @xmath4 . to tackle this issue",
    ", we take the redshift intervals to be determined by the intersecting points of luminosity grid - line and flux limit curve ( see fig . 10 ( b ) ) . alternatively ,",
    "if one persists in dividing redshift intervals randomly , the luminosity intervals should be determined by the intersecting points of redshift grid - line and flux limit curve ( see fig . 10 ( c ) ) .",
    "11 shows the binned lfs produced by the @xmath0 and @xmath1 methods for our simulated data with the redshift and luminosity intervals determined according to the rule suggested above ( fig .",
    "10 ( c ) specifically ) .",
    "it is noticed that adopting the rule of thumb indeed improved the binned lfs to some extent , especially for @xmath4 . obviously , @xmath4 is more sensitive to how the intervals are chosen than @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite noticed that for objects close to the flux limit @xmath4 nearly always to be too small .",
    "we believe this is due to the arbitrary choosing of redshift and luminosity intervals . if the intervals are chosen appropriately , @xmath4 is only slightly larger than @xmath5 at the faint end of lfs . and",
    "it is hard to say the estimate of @xmath1 method is markedly better than the @xmath0 method . in this sense ,",
    "the improvement of the @xmath1 method over the @xmath0 method is probably slight .",
    "a non - parametric method is necessary when investigating the lfs , as it constructs the lfs directly from the data and makes no assumptions about the form of the lfs .",
    "examples of non - parametric methods include the classical @xmath103 method @xcite , the @xmath104 method @xcite , the step - wise max likelihood method @xcite and the @xmath105 method @xcite , as well as the @xmath0 and @xmath1 methods discussed here .    the @xmath105 method ( also see * ? ? ?",
