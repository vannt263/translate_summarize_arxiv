    "supernovae ( sne ) and supernova remnants ( snr s ) are thought to be the main `` drivers '' of the starburst phenomenon ( @xcite ) .",
    "detailed radio observations for supernovae and supernova remnants are few , due to the fact that only a small subset of the extragalactic sne discovered each year produce detectable radio emission .",
    "those events for which monitoring data is available ( e.g. @xcite ) have revealed considerable information regarding the evolution of the properties of the expanding shock wave and its emission processes . in intense starbursts like m82 , where a significant population of massive stars has had sufficient time to evolve to the sn stage , we have the unique opportunity to study a collection of snr s of similar age and origin , and their interaction with the surrounding environment .",
    "the observations are briefly outlined in section 2 .",
    "we discuss the technique used to fit spectral models in section 3 .",
    "then in section 4 we discuss the physical implications of our modelling . throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume that the distance to m82 is 3.63 mpc ( @xcite , @xcite ) , so that 1@xmath30 corresponds to 17.6 pc .",
    "we have used observations of m82 at @xmath0 20 , 6 , 3.6 , 2 , and 1.3 cm . to supplement these observations ,",
    "we have added published flux densities at @xmath0 74 and 18 cm ( 408 and 1666 mhz ) for individual radio point sources as measured with the merlin interferometer by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 2 and 1.3 cm data were first presented in @xcite and are composed of vla data collected at all four configurations , including data from the flux monitoring program of kronberg & sramek ( see e.g. kronberg & sramek 1992 ) between 1983 and 1992 .",
    "the @xmath4 20 cm data is from two a - array observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath4 6 cm data is a combination of vla data from its a- , c- and d - configurations .",
    "the @xmath4 3.6 cm data were collected in 1994 - 5 in the vla s a- , b- and c - configurations , and were combined with a previous observation in the d - configuration , first presented in @xcite .",
    "the combined datasets at @xmath020 , 6 , 3.6 , 2 and 1.3 cm were mapped and clean - deconvolved using the nrao s aips imaging software . to eliminate the bright background emission and",
    "concentrate on the point sources , we restricted the lower @xmath5-baseline range so that no structures spatially larger than 4@xmath6 were present .",
    "this range proved most effective - restricting the data to smaller structures led to point spread functions that had large negative sidelobes , that in turn led to deconvolution problems ; allowing larger structures led to a non - zero background that tended to cause problems with the determination of the integrated fluxes of the point sources .",
    "the complete list of images used is given in table 1 .",
    "a full description of the data reduction of the combined vla datasets will be given in a forthcoming paper , where we will also present a study of the diffuse radio emission defining the nuclear region of m82 .",
    "the datasets were mapped at 0@xmath330 and 0@xmath320 resolution .",
    "these beamsizes were chosen for proper flux density scaling with the lower frequency data of unger _",
    "_ , which has a fwhm of 0@xmath325 at 18 cm .",
    "at the same time we wanted to guard against missing flux from possible partial resolution of the radio sources . to each source",
    "we fitted 2-d gaussian profiles using the aips task imfit . for a given wavelength",
    ", we then compared the results of the fitting at each resolution against each other , and against the result of adding up the flux in each pixel of the radio source ( aips task tvstat ) .    for this latter pixel - adding method",
    ", we only included those pixels of the radio source that contained emission above the background local to the source .",
    "this background was determined by eye , by examining profiles of slices through the sources .",
    "fluxes determined in this way served as a quick check on the gaussian fits , and were not used as data points in any of our spectral fits .    in general , the values for the integrated fluxes determined using each method agreed well with each other , although the pixel - added tvstat fluxes were generally smaller .",
    "the flux values quoted in table 2 are the weighted average of the gaussian - fitted fluxes obtained at both resolutions , except for sources that were partially resolved at 0@xmath320 , for which we used only the 0@xmath330 results .",
    "these latter were unresolved in all cases .",
    "the errors given for each fit are the larger of the errors calculated by imfit , and the 3-@xmath7 level on each map . for the sources in m82 , these resolutions are ideal : they are sufficiently high to isolate the sources from the background emission , and yet not so high as to resolve the sources out .",
    "the best resolution obtainable for the @xmath4 20 cm data was a 1@xmath315@xmath80@xmath392 beam in position angle 38@xmath96 ( ccw from north ) , which matches the resolution of the @xmath4 74 cm data .",
    "we chose only those point sources that were clearly separated from any neighbours .",
    "we compared our @xmath4 3.6 cm results against those of @xcite , who had a resolution of 0@xmath3182 .",
    "our fluxes are systematically greater than theirs . on average , the values of @xcite",
    "are only 66% of our values .",
    "we speculate that the difference is due to a combination of ( 1 ) missing flux on their part due to partial resolution of the sources , and ( 2 ) possible inclusion on our part of contaminating larger - scale flux along the same line of sight to the source .",
    "since we intentionally excluded structures larger than 4@xmath6 , this presumed large - scale flux would be of very low surface - brightness and would be physically unrelated to the compact radio sources .",
    "the values listed in this publication are consistent with a power - law interpretation of the high - frequency shape of the spectra of the point sources .",
    "the complete results for the fluxes of 25 radio point sources are given in table 2 ( we treat 41.9 + 58 separately , in table 3 ) .",
    "of the 19 sources listed by @xcite , we found that one of their sources ( 47.7 + 62 ) had no corresponding feature in our maps , and two of their sources could not be identified uniquely with a particular source at our wavebands . on the other hand",
    ", we were able to identify every source listed by @xcite .",
    "[ [ the - source-41.958 ] ] the source 41.9 + 58 + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    to correct for the decaying flux of 41.9 + 58 , we used the variability results from @xcite to determine that the approximate decay rate is 8.8%/year .",
    "we applied this rate to the fluxes measured by wills _",
    "et al . _ . our chosen epoch for the maps",
    "is may 1993 ( `` 1993.4 '' ) .",
    "the flux values used for the spectral fit are listed in table 3 .",
    "we note that the corrected epoch-1984 408 mhz flux is 72@xmath108 mjy , whereas the corrected epoch-1997 flux is 117@xmath108 mjy .",
    "this discrepancy can be understood by realizing that for this source , @xcite discovered that the turnover frequency is evolving over time , as is the spectral index at all frequencies .",
    "in particular , the source is becoming optically thin at progressively lower frequencies .",
    "this effect has also been seen in other young radio supernovae ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the measured decay rate of 8.8%/year is derived from @xmath4 6 cm ( 4.8 ghz ) data .",
    "therefore our flux corrections are most accurate within the powerlaw regime of the spectrum , i.e. the higher frequencies , where the spectral index has been evolving slowly .",
    "our decay estimate is least certain at the lower frequencies where the emission is optically thick .",
    "overall we are probably underestimating the errors associated with the flux of 41.9 + 58 .",
    "to each point source , we fitted two composite models to the emission spectrum : ( 1 ) a model of synchrotron and thermal ( ) emission , with a thermally absorbing screen located between the source and the observer , and ( 2 ) a co - spatial mix of synchrotron and thermally - absorbing gas .",
    "these two models are represented by the equations ( cf .",

    "therefore , we wrote out the @xmath17 equations and their derivatives in full .",
    "it was discovered that two of the parameters , ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) could be expressed completely in terms of the other two ( @xmath14 and @xmath16 ) .",
    "a grid over reasonable values of these two latter parameters was constructed , and a value for @xmath17 at each point was generated .",
    "we chose the set of ( @xmath14 , @xmath16 ) that yielded the lowest value for @xmath17 .",
    "the spectral `` best '' fits are included in tables 4 , 5 and 6 , and are plotted in figure 1 .    in table 4 , we list the best fit parameters for those sources that have no firm evidence for absorption .",
    "tables 5 and 6 list the best fit parameters for absorbed sources - for table 5 we have used a screen model fit ( equation 1 ) , and for table 6 we have used a mixed model fit ( equation 2 ) .",
    "only one source had a very uncertain spectral shape , 47.37 + 680 .",
    "for this source we plotted both the power - law fit and a fit for the screen model ; for the mixed model fit no sensible solution was reached .    to evaluate the reliability of our fits ,",
    "we generated test data , and examined slices through the @xmath17 surface . the surfaces",
    "were irregularly shaped , with a pronounced absolute minimum at the location expected for the test data . by varying the spectral index @xmath14 between -0.11 and -2.20 in increments of 0.01 , and the optical thickness parameter @xmath16 from 0.10 to 4.00 ghz in increments of 0.01 ghz",
    ", we were able to unambiguously identify the best fit solution within an error equal to the size of the grid increments .",

    "the values scale with the undetermined parameters @xmath20 , which is the ratio of the relativistic proton to electron energy densities , and @xmath21 , which is the fraction of the source s volume occupied by relativistic particles and fields ( refer to the notes in tables 4 , 5 & 6 ) . from direct cosmic ray observations near the solar system",
    ", it is thought that @xmath20 is between 40 - 100 in the milky way ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we assumed that the intrinsic spectral index for each source was constant from 0.01 to 100 ghz . in most of the sources ,",
    "the equipartition magnetic field is about 1 - 2 mgauss .",
    "bright , compact radio sources in other galaxies have similar inferred field strengths ( @xcite ) .",

    "the corresponding minimum pressures of the synchrotron plasma within the point sources have been calculated using equation ( 7.15 ) of @xcite .",
    "they are of order @xmath22 10@xmath24 dynes @xmath25 .",
    "these values are derived assuming that the sources have particles and fields distributed homogeneously throughout a spherical volume , and hence represent lower limits .",

    "this evidence supports the theory that supernovae add mechanical and magnetic energy into the ism of starburst galaxies .",
    "the spectral fits for the steep - spectrum sources ( @xmath14 @xmath19 -0.49 ) show very low levels of free - free emission .",
    "these values are generally so low as to have a negligible effect on the actual shape of the spectra .",
    "the exceptions are sources 43.31 + 591 , 46.52 + 638 , 46.56 + 738 , and 46.70 + 670 .",
    "[ [ low - frequency - turnovers ] ] low frequency turnovers + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the most striking feature of the spectra is that 17 of the 20 steep - spectrum sources ( and one flat - spectrum source , see below ) show a low - frequency turnover .",
    "we will consider the nature of this phenomenon in this section .",
    "the discussion applies to homogeneous sources .",
    "a turnover at the lower end of a synchrotron spectrum can result from many situations : the synchrotron source can become optically thick due to self - absorption , the injected relativistic electrons can have a low - energy cutoff , plasma effects , or absorption by intervening .",
    "we will show that intervening is the most likely cause .",
    "optically thick synchrotron emission has a spectral index @xmath30 , where @xmath31 .",
    "synchrotron self - absorption becomes important for sources with a brightness temperature @xmath32 k. the brightest source in our sample ( 41.9 + 58 ) has @xmath33 k at 1.4 ghz , well below the synchrotron self - absorption threshold , so we can discount self - absorption because the surface brightnesses are too low .",
    "if the synchrotron radiation is emitted in a plasma , then the presence of thermal electrons will decrease the emission efficiency of the relativistic electrons , called the tsytovich - razin effect ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this effect becomes important at frequencies @xmath34 ( cgs ) . for our derived @xmath35 mg ,",
    "this effect becomes noticeable at 1 ghz for an electron number density of @xmath36 @xmath37 .",
    "at such high densities , however , free - free absorption is a more important effect .",
    "the free - free optical depth is @xmath38 at n@xmath39 = 5 @xmath8 10@xmath40 @xmath37 , t@xmath39 = 10@xmath40 k , @xmath41 = 1 ghz , and for a typical m82 snr of radius s = 0.8 pc ( 0.05 ) , the free - free optical depth is 660 !",
    "we can thus discount a tsytovich - razin - like cutoff to explain the low - frequency shape of the spectra .",
    "if the source is optically thin at all frequencies , then the spectrum will have a spectral index @xmath42 at frequencies below the lower cutoff frequency .",
    "this slope is characteristic of the emission from a single synchrotron electron at frequencies below its critical frequency .",
    "two sources ( 40.68 + 550 and 44.01 + 595 ) have spectral indices steeper than @xmath43 at the lowest measured frequencies , which requires some absorption mechanism .",
    "since the spectral properties of the compact sources are similar , it is most probable that the mechanism responsible for the low frequency turnover is interstellar , and not a property intrinsic to each individual source .",
    "therefore we did not test for an intrinsic lower cutoff frequency",
    ". it would be clearly desirable to obtain even lower frequency measurements , down to 150 mhz , in order to probe the spectra most fully .",
    "rather , we conclude that free - free absorption is the most important effect .",
    "our spectra were fit by models involving absorbing gas , located either ( 1 ) in an intervening screen located between the source and the telescope , or ( 2 ) mixed with the synchrotron - emitting particles . from the data , it is not possible to dismiss either situation on statistical grounds alone .",
    "to better understand the nature of this absorbing gas , we need to examine other tracers of in the nucleus of m82 .",
    "as remarked by @xcite in an analysis of their [ ] data , the snr s are found outside of regions of highest [ ] brightness , i.e. ionized gas .",
    "consistent with this observation , no correlation is found between the positions of the snr and the radio recombination line ( rrl ) images of @xcite .",
    "these data trace gas that is located throughout the nuclear region of the galaxy , and perhaps concentrated in a ring , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "we will try to estimate whether there is enough of this ambient gas to cause the absorption effects we see here .",
    "@xcite state that the density of thermal electrons is between 10 - 100 @xmath37 .",
    "since the snr s avoid the brightest regions of rrl emission , we assume an average value of 50 @xmath37 for interstellar thermal electrons . at a temperature @xmath44 k , the snr emission at 1 ghz would have to travel a distance of over 1 kpc to be extinguished to an optical depth of 1 .",
    "this size represents the entire extent of the radio nucleus of m82 , and would indicate that all the `` extinguished '' snr s ( i.e. the majority of them ) were located at the far side of the nuclear region .",
    "it is more likely that the snr s are distributed at a variety of depths into the nuclear region .",
    "we therefore need to test the optical depth of more dense clouds . for an cloud with @xmath45 @xmath37 and @xmath44",
    "k , at 1 ghz radio photons need travel less than 0.03 pc to be extinguished to an optical depth of 1 .",
    "the rrl data of @xcite suggest that regions with high electron densities do exist , and that they have a very low filling factor .",
    "we support the scenario favoured by many authors , that the ism in m82 is extremely non - uniform , in which the energy from stellar winds and sne completely dominates the state of the gas .",
    "only extremely dense clouds have survived the disruptive effects of these processes .",
    "these clouds cause the absorption seen at the longer wavelengths in the compact sources , either because they lie along the same line of sight to the source , or the absorbing gas is associated with the source itself .",
    "[ [ section ] ] 44.01 + 595 + + + + + + + + +    spectrum fitting of this source by @xcite suggested that it is unusual in that it has a rising spectrum towards higher frequencies .",
    "they , and other authors ( e.g. @xcite ) consider it to be an agn candidate .",
    "our data shows the opposite - the source has a falling , power - law spectrum between @xmath0 3.6 and 1.3 cm .",
    "the source shows the strongest absorption in this survey , being optically thick below 2.01 ghz .",
    "the spectrum is therefore rising below 2 ghz , and this fact is probably the cause of the previous confusion concerning the shape of the spectrum . the radio continuum spectrum alone is not a good discriminator for agn candidates .",
    "we feel that the evidence to date concerning this source raises intriguing questions as to its identity .",
    "a detailed vlbi study will likely be necessary to determine the exact properties of this source .",

    "both powerlaw and curve fits seem to work , but the curve fit predicts fainter high - frequency emission , hence fits the sense of the data better .",
    "this source has the shape of a ring or shell in our highest resolution maps , and therefore its integrated flux was determined by adding up the flux on a pixel - by - pixel basis using the aips task tvstat .",
    "we show an x - band map of the source in figure 4 , at a resolution of 0@xmath323 .",
    "the source is roughly circular , with a diameter of about 0@xmath391 , or about 16 pc .",
    "if the remnant has been expanding undecelerated , at a rate v ( in km s@xmath2 ) , then its age would be @xmath22 3100 @xmath46 years .    from its large size , this remnant would be judged the oldest one in our sample . assuming that the @xmath2250 other sources are radio snr , we estimate a supernova rate of @xmath220.016 @xmath47 yr@xmath2 , or , assuming v=5000 km s@xmath2 , one supernova explosion every 62 years . this estimate is lower than those found by other authors , however , increasingly sensitive surveys have increased the number of known compact sources , and hence our value is probably a lower limit .",
