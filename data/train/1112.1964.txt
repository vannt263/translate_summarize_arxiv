    "the exciting lhc era will soon answer one of the most important questions in particle physics : the existence or nonexistence of a light standard model ( sm ) higgs boson",
    ". this will be the most valuable result in particle physics in the last thirty years .",
    "the discovery of a sm higgs boson will complete the sm and the argument for the existence of new physics will be solely from a naturalness viewpoint . on the other hand , nonexistence of a sm higgs boson",
    "will be more interesting in a sense that it gives us hints of new particles or new dynamics at the tev scale .",
    "discovering those additional particles and dynamics in the absence of a sm higgs boson would be a subsequent focus of the lhc program .    from the viewpoint of simplicity",
    ", the higgs mechanism is an economical way to provide the @xmath1 and @xmath2 gauge boson masses as well as fermion masses in the sm .",
    "the higgs couplings to gauge bosons and fermions are hence dictated by electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) and should not be modified too much from physics at a higher scale .",
    "the null result for the sm higgs from the lhc searches does not immediately lead to the conclusion that no fundamental higgs field is responsible for ewsb .",
    "actually , there are two generic possibilities to explain the null 7 tev lhc higgs searches : the higgs boson has a new non - standard decay channel that suppresses the branching ratios of the sm decay channel , or the production cross section of the higgs boson from gluon fusion is suppressed because of other qcd charged particles contributing to the effective operator between the higgs boson and two gluons . for sure ,",
    "another plausible possibility to explain the non - existence of a sm higgs boson at the lhc would be _ no higgs boson _ at all and use new strong dynamics like the technicolor models  @xcite or higgsless models  @xcite to explain ewsb .",
    "mechanisms to hide the sm higgs boson is not new at all in the literature . there are numerous activities that concentrate on a light higgs boson with a mass below 200 gev ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . however , less attention has been paid to the case of a heavy higgs boson , which will be the main focus of this paper .",
    "one motivation to consider a heavy higgs boson is that the fine - tuning problem becomes less stringent as for a lighter one  @xcite .",
    "another motivation actually comes from the electroweak precision test ( ewpt ) . as is well known , a heavy higgs boson is not preferred by the electroweak precision data .",
    "for example , the oblique parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5  @xcite prefer a lighter higgs boson , assuming there are no new contributions .",
    "therefore , a heavy higgs boson should always be accompanied by new particles beyond the sm to be consistent with the ewpt .",
    "it is not hard to imagine that these new particles could change the higgs properties as well . taking simplicity as a guidance , in this paper we consider adding only one new particle at a time charged under the sm gauge group for both to obtain consistency with the electroweak precision observables and to hide a heavy higgs boson from direct searches .",
    "considerable efforts have been spent on relaxing the electroweak constraints on the higgs boson mass , which were summarized into three scenarios in ref .",
    "@xcite ten years ago .",
    "the first scenario is to add particles whose vacuum polarization integral shifts @xmath3 in the negative direction .",
    "the main example of this is given by scalar fields in several specific multiplets of @xmath6 , where the first @xmath7 is the weak interaction gauge group and the second one is the custodial symmetry group  @xcite .",
    "the second method is to add heavy @xmath8 vector bosons to shift all three oblique corrections  @xcite .",
    "finally , one could add new particles that produce a nonzero , positive @xmath4 with or without changing @xmath3 .",
    "this have been implemented in quite a few new physics models , for instance , the ` topcolor seesaw ' where ewsb arises from a heavy @xmath7 singlet fermion  @xcite . here",
    ", we will loosely follow  @xcite and introduce new scalars or fermions which are charged under the electroweak gauge group and modify the @xmath3 and @xmath4 parameters at the same time .",
    "our main focus , however , is to explore how the new physics required by the ewpt modifies the properties of a heavy higgs , in particular how the higgs can be hidden at the 7 tev lhc .",
    "if the new particles are also charged under qcd , the production cross section of the heavy higgs boson from gluon fusion can be modified and even reduced dramatically compared to the sm rate .",
    "one such example we will discuss in detail is a colored scalar with a negative quartic coupling to the higgs . after taking into account the current collider constraints of these new colored scalar particles",
    ", we find that a viable model exists to reduce the gluon - fusion production cross section of the higgs boson by as much as 90% .",
    "hence , a heavy higgs boson consistent with ewpt could still be allowed by the 7 tev lhc searches . since these colored particles have large production cross sections at the lhc , performing a specific search for these states at the lhc can indirectly provide constraints on a heavy higgs boson .    for new qcd - singlet particles ,",
    "the production cross section can not be modified dramatically , but new decay channels of a heavy higgs boson can open up . however",
    ", this way of hiding a higgs can only work for a higgs boson with an intermediate mass below 400 gev , above which the higgs boson sm decay width becomes so large that the partial width of the new decay channels could not dominate in any perturbative model .",
    "below , we will check the current collider constraints on these new qcd - singlet particles and discuss various viable non - standard decays of a heavy higgs boson .",
    "our paper is organized as following . in section  [ sec : stu ] , we first review the current status about electroweak precision measurements with an emphasis on the oblique parameters .",
    "then , we discuss how to hide a heavy higgs boson by including a new color - singlet particle in section  [ sec : color - singlet ] , where we will first check the electroweak precision constrains on the masses of different isospin states in section  [ sec : scalarewpt ] and then study the collider signatures as well as constraints in section  [ sec : scalarcollider ] . for qcd - charged particles in section  [ sec : qcd ] , we first consider the qcd charged scalar and consider their constraints from the ewpt as well as from colliders in section  [ sec : qcdscalars ] .",
    "the modifications on the higgs production cross section from gluon fusion will be discussed in section  [ sec : higgsproduction ] .",
    "we then consider the fermion case in section  [ sec : qcdfermions ] by mixing a new fermion with the top quark .",
    "after that , we also consider collider constraints on an additional @xmath0 gauge boson mixing with the @xmath2 boson and hence modifying the electroweak precision observables in section  [ sec : zprime ] .",
    "for the last case of a non - linearly realized ewsb , we discusssed a scenario to transfer the constraints from oblique parameters to triple - gauge boson couplings in section  [ sec : nonlinear ] .",
    "finally , we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the usual wisdom to prefer a lighter higgs boson is because a light higgs boson is more consistent with the ewpt .",
    "using the recent results from the gfitter group  @xcite , the higgs mass is constrained to be @xmath9  gev by the standard fit and @xmath10  gev by a complete fit including the lep data , the tevatron and 2010 lhc null results of direct higgs searches .",
    "the upper mass constraint for a sm higgs boson is 169  gev ( 200  gev ) at 95% ( 99% ) c.l . from the standard fit and 143  gev ( 149  gev ) from the complete fit .",
    "the shortly - coming lhc direct serches with a luminosity of 5 - 10 fb@xmath11 should cover all the mass range of a light higgs boson .    in many new physics models , additional particles can easily modify the electroweak precision observables .",
    "so , a more proper attitude towards a heavy higgs boson around or above 200 gev is to include additional new heavier particles in the ewpt . in this paper",
    ", we are going to take this attitude and consider minimal models by including only one new particle at a time . the common approach to constrain physics beyond the sm with the precision electroweak data",
    "is through the formalism of oblique parameters : @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 @xmath12 parameter measures new physics contributions to the derivate differences of gauge current vacuum polarizations at zero momenta .",
    "the @xmath4 parameter indicates the difference between the new physics contributions of neutral and charged vacuum polarization at low energies , _",
    "i.e. _ , it is sensitive to weak isospin violation .",
    "generally as the new physics predicts a negligible contribution to @xmath5 with a few exceptions such as models with anomalous @xmath1 interactions  @xcite , one could fix @xmath13 and only consider the constraints from the @xmath3 and @xmath4 parameters .",
    "contour plot with the reference sm higgs mass at 500 gev ( blue and upper ) and 250 gev ( red and lower ) . for each mass ,",
    "the two contours correspond to 68% and 95% c.l .",
    "constraints.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    fixing @xmath13 , the most updated global electroweak fit at the reference point @xmath14  gev and @xmath15  gev is  @xcite s|_u=0 = 0.070.09 , t|_u=0 = 0.10 0.08 , ( m^ref_h = 120  ) , with a correlation coefficient of @xmath16   parameter  @xcite . in this paper , we consider the result of fit including also high energy experiment data . ] .",
    "shift in the reference point has to be compensated by shifts in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 parameters . for a higgs boson heavier than 120 gev",
    ", the central value of @xmath3 from new physics contribution is required to be reduced by @xmath17 while the central value of @xmath4 from new physics is increased by @xmath18 .",
    "for instance , at @xmath19  gev and @xmath15  gev , the new physics should have the following contributions to the oblique parameters s|_u=0 = -0.0060.09 , t|_u=0 = 0.32 0.08 , ( m^ref_h = 500  ) .",
    "thus for theories with a heavy higgs to be compatible with the precision data , there should be new particles shifting @xmath4 in the positive direction and/or pushing @xmath3 to be negative .",
    "the allowed regions in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 plane with @xmath20  gev and @xmath19  gev are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : smst500250 ] .",
    "one can easily see from fig .",
    "[ fig : smst500250 ] that a heavy higgs boson without other new physics is inconsistent with the electroweak observables at more than 3@xmath21 level .    in general",
    ", one can introduce additional weak charged particles and adjust the mass differences of their isospin components to fix the @xmath4 parameter while keeping the @xmath3-parameter almost untouched . yet the constraints from fitting the @xmath4 parameter can not set a constraint on the absolute mass scales .",
    "interestingly , by requiring those particles to modify the higgs decays or production cross sections , one can also fix the masses of those particles and hence have a pretty concrete prediction for the lhc . for sure , this kind of prediction is only possible due to our simplicity assumption that only one new particle is relevant for both ewpt and higgs phenomenologies .",
    "for color - singlet and @xmath7 charged particles , the production cross section of the higgs boson can not be modified significantly .",
    "so , in this section we will concentrate on the parameter space where the heavy higgs boson has a new decay channel dominant over the sm channels . in principle , the new particles could be scalars or fermions . however , to fix the electroweak precision observables we found that a large mass splitting is required .",
    "thus the fermion case is not preferred as no renormalizable operators can be written down to achieve that and a large modification of the @xmath4 parameter is not anticipated . on the contrary ,",
    "renormalizable operators coupling the sm higgs field to the new weak multiplet exists to generate a sizable splitting inside the scalar multiplet .",
    "therefore , in this section we only study the scalars and consider two models with a weak doublet or a weak triplet .",
    "we first consider the weak doublet model , which has been studied before with an emphasis on the dark matter phenomenology under the name of inert doublet models  @xcite . here",
    ", we will not use the dark matter relic abundance as a constraint on the parameter space but rather consider more generic collider consequences of those new particles .",
    "it is shown that these new scalars could produce a negative @xmath3 as long as the lightest state in the multiplet also has the smallest spin  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", the custodial symmetry is always preserved by the interactions of the new electroweak multiplets and hence the @xmath4 parameter is not modified . below we will consider a more general model with custodial breaking operators , in which both @xmath3 and @xmath4 will be modified .",
    "the model contains an addition scalar doublet @xmath22 transforming as @xmath23 under @xmath24 . for simplicity",
    ", we impose an approximate or exact @xmath25 parity on the new doublet and first consider only @xmath25 conserving operators . for @xmath26 ,",
    "this is exactly the inert doublet model considered in @xcite .",
    "further studies on this model could be found in  @xcite .",
