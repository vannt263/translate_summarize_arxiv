    "it has been known for some time that plasmas can support very large electric fields , and can therefore be used for accelerating particles to relativistic energies .",
    "initially , laser driven plasma wakefield acceleration was considered in the literature  @xcite , and experimental verification of the ideas followed  @xcite .",
    "detailed simulations of the process are now available which have indicated the production of electron beams with interesting characteristics . in recent experiments , gradients in the range @xmath5  gv / m have been achieved .",
    "these have so far been limited to distances of a few cm , but the progress has been very impressive  @xcite . in order to accelerate an electron bunch to 1  tev",
    ", these gradients would have to be maintained over distances of tens of meters , or many acceleration stages would have to be combined .",
    "it was later recognized that the plasma could also be excited by an electron bunch  @xcite .",
    "given an intense enough bunch of electrons , the plasma is both created  @xcite and excited by the passage of the bunch .",
    "very large electric fields were predicted and later observed  @xcite . in the linear regime , the maximal achievable gradient can be written  @xcite as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the number of particles in the driving bunch and @xmath8 is the length ( rms ) of the bunch assuming a gaussian beam profile . in the case of electron driven plasma wakefield acceleration , a gradient of @xmath9  gv / m was achieved and sustained at slac for almost @xmath10  m  @xcite .",
    "however , the maximum energy which can be given to a particle in the witness bunch is limited by the transformer ratio , @xmath11 which is at most @xmath12 for longitudinally symmetric drive bunches  @xcite .",
    "this upper limit can in principle be overcome by nonsymmetric bunches  @xcite , but , given the difficulty in producing a short bunch in the first place , it is hard to imagine that these short bunches can also be shaped and the shape maintained over the distances needed for acceleration to high energies .",
    "@xmath13  gev electron beams would therefore be needed to produce a @xmath10  tev beam , or many stages of plasma acceleration would be needed to arrive at the desired energy range . in the first case , one could imagine a bootstrapping process , where a drive bunch of @xmath9  gev is used to produce @xmath14  gev bunches , which are then used to produce @xmath15  gev bunches , etc .",
    "the efficiency of such a process would be an issue . in the second case , very precise control of the bunch exiting the plasma",
    "would be required since the relative timing of the drive bunch and witness bunch is critical .",
    "plasma wave excitation by a negatively charged driver is now well studied both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "in contrast to plasmas driven by electron beams , only limited investigations of the plasma wave excitation by a positively charged driver exist  @xcite . in the linear wake field regime",
    "the electric field distribution should be the same as that for the negative driver but shifted in phase .",
    "however , the path to the non - linear stage differs significantly as revealed in multi - dimensional particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations  @xcite .",
    "physically , the negatively charged driver `` blows out '' the background plasma electrons creating a low density region behind the driver .",
    "the non - linear `` blow out '' regime has quite useful properties that make it successful in plasma - based acceleration : it provides the very high accelerating field , which does not depend on the transverse coordinate , while the transverse fields are focusing both for the driver and for the witness bunch .",
    "the `` blow - out '' regime allows for a rapid energy transfer from the driver to the witness beam , thus leading to an efficient acceleration of electrons  @xcite .",
    "it is much more difficult to reach the blow - out regime with a positively charged driver , such as protons . instead of `` blowing out '' plasma electrons , they `` suck them in '' towards the propagation axis . due to the radial symmetry",
    ", this leads to an electron density enhancement on - axis and effective increase of the local plasma frequency . as a result",
    ", the proton driver must be even shorter in order to excite the plasma wake resonantly . in the highly non - linear regime",
    ", one has to rely on numerical simulations to find the optimal beam - plasma parameters for the resonant wake field generation .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the possibility of driving the plasma wave with an intense bunch of protons . given that protons can be accelerated to the tev regime in conventional accelerators ,",
    "it is conceivable to accelerate electron bunches in the wake of the proton bunch up to several tev ( e.g. , in the wake of an lhc proton beam ) in one pass through the plasma .",
    "several issues come to mind , such as the possibility of producing a proton bunch with large enough charge density , the possibility of phase slippage as protons slow down , the effect of proton beam divergence and dissipation in the plasma , etc . we will discuss these points below .",
    "we then discuss a specific parameter set close to existing proton beams , and show that the production of a @xmath16  tev electron beam is in principle allowed with a pdpwa ( proton driven plasma wakefield accelerator ) .",
    "the accelerating structure we have studied for proton - driven plasma wakefield acceleration is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : cell ] . a high density proton bunch propagates through the plasma and",
    "sets the plasma electrons in motion .",
    "the plasma of the required density can be produced , e.g. , by tunnel ionization of a neutral gas with a high - intensity laser pulse that propagates shortly ahead of the proton beam . for a highly relativistic driving bunch ,",
    "the electric field seen by the plasma electrons is in the transverse direction , and the plasma electrons begin to oscillate around their equilibrium position with frequency @xmath17 given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the density of plasma electrons . given their large mass , the plasma ions are effectively frozen .",
    "the oscillating electrons initially move toward the beam axis , then pass through each other , creating a cavity with very strong electric fields .",
    "the cavity structure repeats , and the pattern moves with the proton bunch velocity .",

    "the quadrupole magnets are @xmath20  cm long .",
    "the blow - up shows the plasma bubble created by the proton bunch ( red ) .",
    "the electron bunch ( yellow ) undergoing acceleration is located at the back of the bubble .",

    "[ eq : lwfa ] applies to particles of either charge , and can therefore be used to calculate the field produced by a bunch of protons passing through a cold plasma ( the nonlinear case will be discussed below ) .",
    "proton bunches with @xmath21 protons per bunch are available today , and the main issue in producing strong electric fields in the plasma is the formation of short proton bunches .",
    "tev proton beams typically have a relative momentum spread @xmath22 and a rms bunch length of @xmath9  cm . assuming this longitudinal phase space area is preserved and that a technically feasible scheme for a phase rotation will be found , a proton bunch with @xmath23  @xmath24 m would have a momentum spread of about @xmath9  % .",
    "this is likely too large .",
    "the lhc foresees reaching @xmath22 for bunches with rms length of only @xmath25  cm . in this case ,",
    "@xmath23  @xmath24 m could in principle be achieved with a momentum spread of about @xmath26  % , which is much more favorable .",
    "we have simulated a @xmath10  tev proton driver with @xmath23  @xmath24 m and @xmath27 .      as the proton bunch propagates ,",
    "the momentum spread will induce a longitudinal growth in the beam .",
    "this can be evaluated for vacuum propagation as follows : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the spread of the bunch induced by the momentum spread , @xmath30 is the distance travelled , @xmath31 is the proton mass and @xmath32 the proton momentum . given a @xmath10  tev proton beam , @xmath33  % momentum spread leads to a growth of about @xmath34  @xmath24m / m .",
    "large relative momentum spreads will still allow for long plasma acceleration stages provided the drive beam is relativistic .      as mentioned above",
    ", the plasma has a strong focusing effect on the tail of the drive bunch , as well as on the witness bunch .",
    "however , the head of the drive bunch will tend to fly apart unless quadrupole focusing is applied .",
    "we therefore foresee an arrangement with strong focusing of the proton drive bunch along the length of the plasma channel . a possibility for these quadrupoles are small diameter permanent magnets , such as those described in  @xcite , producing gradients of order 1  t / mm .      another issue is phase slippage between the proton driving bunch and the electron witness bunch .",
    "as the proton bunch travels through the plasma , it will slow down and the phase relation with the light electron bunch will begin to change",
    ". the phase change is given by  @xcite @xmath35 \\\\             & \\approx & \\frac{\\pi l}{\\lambda_p } \\left [ \\frac{m_p^2c^4}{p_fp_ic^2}\\right ] \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the plasma wavelength , and @xmath37 are the initial and final momenta of the protons in the driving bunch .",
    "to maximize the gradient ( eq .  [ eq : lwfa ] ) , the plasma wavelength should have a definite relation to the length of the driving bunch : @xmath38 requiring a phase slippage of only a fraction of the plasma wavelength implies that the driving beam energy can not change appreciably , and this could be a severe limitation on acceleration by a proton bunch .",
    "however , with an initial proton energy of @xmath10  tev and a final energy of @xmath39  tev , it should still be possible to have plasma lengths of many meters .",
    "in addition , it is possible to control the plasma wavelength by adjusting the density of the plasma  @xcite , in part or fully compensating for the phase slippage .",
    "proton interactions in the plasma are not expected to be a big issue .",
    "the plasma density and plasma wavelength are related by @xmath40 typical values of @xmath19 will be in the range @xmath41  @xmath42 , and the mean - free - path for inelastic reactions of high energy protons with the gas will be orders of magnitude larger than the expected plasma cell length .",
    "a geant4  @xcite simulation for a @xmath10  tev proton beam in li vapor of density @xmath43 atoms / cm@xmath2 gives a transverse growth rate of the proton beam of less than @xmath45  @xmath24m / m due to multiple scattering , which is small compared to the size of the proton bunch .",
    "assuming the same gas density , the amount of energy deposited in the magnets by a bunch of @xmath21 protons with @xmath46  tev due to beam secondaries is calculated to be only @xmath47  gy / year , which should not pose a problem with activation of the magnet material or possible demagnetization in case permanent magnets are used . assuming the total proton bunch energy is uniformly distributed in a gas cell of length @xmath48  m , the protons would only deposit about @xmath49",
    "a string of @xmath50 bunches may be passed through the cell in several seconds , so that up to @xmath33  kw of power could be deposited per meter over this time period .",
    "this is not expected to pose any heating problems with the magnet system ( assuming warm magnets are used ) , since rather large volumes of steel will be present .",
    "the main issue in producing strong electric fields in the plasma and using them over long distances to accelerate electrons is clearly the need to produce a proton bunch of order @xmath14  @xmath24 m in length or shorter .",
    "we have simulated the wakefield acceleration process assuming a pipe containing li gas inserted in a region of alternating vertically focusing and defocusing quadrupole fields .",

    "on the other hand , the computationally efficient quasi - static code allows to simulate electron acceleration up to tev energies over hundreds of meters of plasma .    in our numerical simulations",

    "however , our simulations have revealed that due to the wake field nonlinearities , the proton beam excites a very poor plasma wave at this `` linearly predicted '' density .",
