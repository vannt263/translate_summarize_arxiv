    "recent works such as @xcite take a combinatorial approach to knot theory in which knots and links are regarded as equivalence classes of knot and link diagrams .",
    "new types of combinatorial knots and links can then be defined by introducing new types of crossings and reidemeister - style moves that govern their interactions .",
    "these new combinatorial classes of knots and links have various topological and geometric interpretations relating to simple closed curves in 3-manifolds , rigid vertex isotopy of graphs , etc .",
    "a _ flat crossing _ is a classical crossing in which we ignore the over / under information .",
    "a flat knot or link is a planar projection or shadow of a knot or link on the surface on which the knot or link diagram is drawn .",
    "every classical knot diagram may be regarded as a decorated or _",
    "lift _ of a flat knot , and conversely every classical knot diagram has a corresponding flat _ shadow . _    at first glance , flat knots might seem uninteresting since flattening classical crossings apparently throws away the information which defines knotting .",
    "however , a little thought reveals potential applications of flat crossings : invariants of links with classical intercomponent crossings and flat intracomponent crossings are related to link homotopy and milnor invariants of ordinary classical links , for example .",
    "another place where flat crossings prove useful is in virtual knot theory .",
    "every purely flat knot is trivial , i.e. , reducible by flat reidemeister moves to the unknot .",
    "however , flat virtual knots and links ( i.e. , diagrams with virtual and flat crossings ) are generally non - trivial .",
    "non - triviality of a flat virtual says that no choice of classical crossing information for the flat crossings yields a classical knot .",
    "hence , flat crossings are useful in the study of non - classicality in virtual knots .",
    "a _ singular crossing _ is a crossing where two strands are fused together .",
    "singular knots and links may be understood as rigid vertex isotopy classes of knotted and linked graphs , and they play a role in the study of vassiliev invariants of classical knots and links .    in this paper , we define an algebraic structure we call a _ semiquandle _ which yields counting invariants for flat virtual knots . the paper is organized as follows . in section [ fvs ]",

    "the simplest type of knot of those we consider , a _ flat knot _ , is an immersion of @xmath0 in @xmath1 . alternatively",

    "the equivalence relation is given by flat versions of the reidemeister moves . here",
    ", we illustrate the flat reidemeister moves .",
    "@xmath2    it is an easy exercise to show that any flat knot is related to the trivial flat knot ( i.e. the flat knot with no crossings ) by a sequence of flat reidemeister moves .",
    "while the theory of flat knots appears uninteresting , if we consider the analogous theory of flat virtual knots , we enter a highly non - trivial category .",
    "a _ flat virtual knot _ is a decorated immersion of @xmath0 in @xmath1 , where each crossing is decorated to indicate that it is either flat or virtual .",
    "( virtual crossings are pictured by an encircled flat crossing . )",
    "once again , we may also describe a flat virtual knot as an equivalence class of virtual knot diagrams where under / over strand information at each classical crossing is unspecified .",
    "the corresponding equivalence relation is given by the flat versions of the virtual reidemeister moves in addition to the flat versions of the ordinary reidemeister moves .",
    "@xmath3 @xmath4    note that the following move is forbidden .",
    "@xmath5    as with ordinary virtual knots , flat virtual knot diagrams have a geometric interpretation as flat knot diagrams on surfaces . in this case , the virtual crossings are interpreted as artifacts of a projection of the knot diagram on the surface to a knot diagram in the plane  @xcite .    finally , we d like to consider flat knots and flat virtual knots that have _",
    "singularities_. these singularities should be thought of as rigid vertices , or places where the knot is actually glued to itself .",
    "thus , _ flat singular knots _ are simply equivalence classes of flat knots where some crossings are decorated to indicate that they are singular .",
    "the reidemeister moves corresponding to flat singular equivalence are the ordinary flat equivalence moves together with the following two moves .    @xmath6    similarly , _",
    "flat virtual singular knots _ are equivalence classes of flat virtual knots where some of the crossings may be designated as singular .",
    "hence , there are three types of crossings that may be contained in a diagram of a flat virtual singular knot .",
    "the equivalence relation is given by all of the previous flat , virtual , and singular moves together with the following move .",
    "@xmath7    we call the simplest non - trivial flat virtual singular knot that contains all three types of crossings the _ triple crazy trefoil .",

    "the unique @xmath11 in axiom ( 0 ) will be denoted @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",

    "@xmath14    in the first reidemeister move , right - invertibility guarantees the uniqueness of @xmath15 given @xmath16 , and the relationship between @xmath16 and @xmath15 becomes axiom ( i ) .",

    "as with singular crossings , we can further generalize semiquandles by adding an operation at virtual crossings . the simplest way to do",

    "@xmath46    as noted in @xcite , this setup ensures that the virtual i , ii and iii moves are respected by the virtual operation .",
    "@xmath47    the interaction of the virtual crossings with the flat and singular crossings given by the reidemeister moves tell us how the virtual operation should interact with the semiquandle and singular semiquandle structures ",
