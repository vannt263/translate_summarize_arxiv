    "big bang nucleosynthesis has been investigated mainly on the context of the standard cosmological model ( sbbn ) , where origin of light elements of @xmath4he , d , and @xmath5li have been discussed in detail  @xcite . while observations of @xmath6he are still in debate with the uncertainty of 20 - 30 % in the abundance  @xcite , those of d constrain severely the possible range of the abundance production in the early universe  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the above standard bbn , the heavy element nucleosynthesis beyond the mass number @xmath7 has been proposed from twenty years ago  @xcite , where the model is called the inhomogeneous bbn ( ibbn ) .",
    "this model relays on the inhomogeneity of baryon concentrations that could be induced by baryogenesis  ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) or some phase transitions such as qcd or electro - weak phase transition  @xcite during the expansion of the universe .",
    "although a large scale inhomogeneity is inhibited by many observations  @xcite , small scale one has been advocated within the present accuracy of the observations .",
    "therefore , it remains a possibility for ibbn to occur in some degree during the early era .",
    "on the other hand , wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) has derived critical parameters concerning the cosmology of which the present baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath8 is determined to be @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "this value is almost consistent with that obtained from the observation of d. therefore , considering the uncertainty of the @xmath6he abundance , we can fix the ratio @xmath8 in the discussion of the nucleosynthesis in the early universe .",
    "if the present ratio of @xmath8 is determined , bbn can be performed along that line in the thermodynamical history with use of the nuclear reaction network . on the other hand ,",
    "peculiar observations of abundances for heavy elements and/or @xmath6he could be understood in the way of ibbn .",
    "for example , the quasar metallicity of c , n , and si could have been explained from ibbn  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , from recent observations of globular clusters , possibility of inhomogeneous helium distribution is pointed out  @xcite , where some separate groups of different main sequences in blue band of low mass stars are assumed due to high primordial helium abundances compared to the standard value @xcite .    despite a negative opinion against ibbn due to insufficient consideration of the scale of the inhomogeneity  @xcite , matsuura et al",
    "have found that the heavy element synthesis for both @xmath2- and @xmath3-processes is possible if @xmath10 @xcite , where they have also shown that the high @xmath8 regions are compatible with the observations of the light elements , @xmath11he and d  @xcite .",
    "however , their analysis is only limited to a parameter of a specific baryon number concentration .",
    "therefore , it should be needed to constrain the possible regions from available observations in the wide parameter space that describes the ibbn .    in  [ sec :",
    "numerical ] , we review and give the adopted model of ibbn  @xcite . constraints on the critical parameters of ibbn due to light element observations are shown in  iii , and the productions of possible heavy element nucleosynthesis is presented in ",
    "finally ,  [ rec : summary ] is devoted to the summary and discussion .",
    "we adopt the two - zone model for the inhomogeneous bbn , where the early universe is assumed to have the high- and low- baryon density regions  @xcite under the background temperature @xmath12 . for simplicity",
    "we ignore the diffusion effects before @xmath13 and during the primordial nucleosynthesis @xmath14 , where the plausibility will be discussed in  [ rec : summary ] .",
    "after the epoch of bbn , all the elements are assumed to be mixed homogeneously .",
    "let us define the notations , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 as averaged- , high- , and low- baryon number densities .",

    "<S> based on a scenario of the inhomogeneous big - bang nucleosynthesis ( ibbn ) , we investigate the detailed nucleosynthesis that includes the production of heavy elements beyond @xmath0li . from the observational constraints on light elements of @xmath1he and d for the baryon - to - photon ratio given by wmap , possible regions found on the plane of the volume fraction of the high density region against the ratio between high- and low - density regions .    in these allowed regions , </S>",
    "<S> we have confirmed that the heavy elements beyond fe can be produced appreciably , where @xmath2- and/or @xmath3-process elements are produced well simultaneously compared to the solar system abundances . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that recent observational signals such as @xmath1he overabundance in globular clusters and high metallicity abundances in quasars could be partly due to the results of ibbn . </S>",
    "<S> possible implications are given for the formation of the first generation stars . </S>"
