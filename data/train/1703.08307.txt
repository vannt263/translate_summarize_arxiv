    "chemical kinetics with multiple time scales and their control involve highly stiff and often high - dimensional ordinary differential equations ( ode ) .",
    "this poses hard challenges to the numerical solution and is the reason why model reduction methods are considered .",
    "the dynamics can be simplified by focusing on the long time behavior of such systems ( leaving fast transients unresolved ) and calculating fast modes as functions of the slow ones .",
    "ideally this leads to low dimensional manifolds in high - dimensional state space . in the special case of singularly perturbed system",
    ", they are understood quite well and called slow invariant manifolds .",
    "an open problem is how the slow manifolds can be used to simplify the solution of optimal control problems ( ocp ) that involve multiple time scale ode constraints .",
    "in dissipative dynamical systems geometrically the bundling of trajectories ( on a fast time scale ) to low - dimensional manifolds is observed .",
    "once trajectories reach the neighborhood of the slow manifold , they will evolve slowly and will never leave this manifold neighborhood .",
    "thus , this manifold is called _ slow invariant attracting manifold _ ( siam ) .",
    "the aim of slow manifold computation techniques is to approximately compute the siam as the graph of a function of only a few selected species ( so called _ reaction progress variables _ ) .",
    "thus , manifold - based model reduction generate a function @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the number of slow variables resp .",
    "reaction progress variables and @xmath2 is the number of fast variables ) , such that @xmath3 approximates points of the siam .    in order to investigate optimal control benchmark problems",
    ", we consider singularly perturbed systems , i.e. systems where the ode can be transformed into the following form :    [ formula : sps ] @xmath4    two methods relevant in our context for the approximative calculation of the siam are briefly reviewed in the following subsections .",
    "the main idea of the zero derivative principle ( zdp ) @xcite,@xcite for model reduction of singularly perturbed systems is to identify for given values of the slow variables @xmath5 a point @xmath6 such that the higher - order time derivatives of fast components vanish , i.e @xmath7      another approach proposed by lebiedz and unger @xcite is motivated geometrically : among arbitrary trajectories of ( [ formula : sps ] ) for which the slow components end within the time @xmath8 in the state @xmath5 the corresponding part of the trajectory on the siam is characterized by the smallest curvature ( see also @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "this motivates optimization problem ( [ formula : unger ] ) which is a variational boundary value problem ( bvp ) .",
    "[ formula : unger ] @xmath9 \\\\      & & { \\varepsilon}\\dot z_f & = f_f\\big(z_s , z_f\\big ) , \\quad t \\in [ t_0,t_1]\\\\      &   &     z_s(t_1 ) & = z_s^*.      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in our application context we also use the local reformulation of problem ( [ formula : unger ] ) , where @xmath10 .",
    "one of our research interests is to solve optimal control problems involving multiple time scales as it appears frequently e.g. in the field of chemical engineering .",
    "thus , we consider the following ( typically high - dimensional ) ocp :    [ formula : origocp ] @xmath11    applying the model reduction methods presented in the last section and assuming the control @xmath12 to be a slow variable , yields the lower dimensional problem ( cf .",
    "@xcite )    [ formula : redocp ] @xmath13    this systems has the advantage , that it has significantly less optimization variables and the ode ( [ formula : redocp ] ) is less stiff , which makes it solvable by fast explicit numerical integrators compared to implicit methods required for stiff ode .",
    "however , numerical solution methods for ocps like the multiple shooting method need repeated evaluation of the function @xmath14 as well as its partial derivatives @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , it would be beneficial to combine the calculation of the sim and the optimal control problem .",
    "this is obviously possible , if the approximation @xmath17 of the sim can be formulated as a ( nonlinear ) root finding problem @xmath18 , e.g. with the zdp method .",
    "thus , we propose to solve the following ocp instead of ( [ formula : redocp ] ) :    [ formula : liftedocp ] @xmath19",
    "we apply the ideas presented in the last sections to a benchmark ocp motivated by the michaelis - menten - henri mechanism @xmath20 modeling the reaction of substrate @xmath21 to a product @xmath22 via a substrate - enzyme - complex @xmath23 with the help of enzyme @xmath24 . simplifying the ode given by ( [ formula : enzyme ] ) and introducing an artificial objective function yields ocp ( [ formula : enzymeocp ] ) .",
    "where the control @xmath26 $ ] represents the possibility to add some substrate ( corresponds to variable @xmath27 ) to the system and @xmath28 describes the time - scale separation ( between the time evolution of @xmath27 and @xmath29 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : enzyme ] shows the results of the numerical solution of ( [ formula : enzymeocp ] ) using the multiple - shooting scheme with an implicit radau-2a integrator .",
    "if we refer to the solution of the proposed ocp ( [ formula : liftedocp ] ) as @xmath30 and to the solution of ( [ formula : enzymeocp ] ) as @xmath31 , then it holds @xmath32 which gives a relative error of @xmath33 for both objective functional value and @xmath34 .",
    "although , the proposed method uses exactly as many variables than the original ocp , we observe a speed up of factor 4 for solving ocp ( [ formula : enzymeocp ] ) due to the use of an explicit integration scheme .        c. w. gear and t. j. kaper and i. g. kevrekidis and a. zagaris ,",
