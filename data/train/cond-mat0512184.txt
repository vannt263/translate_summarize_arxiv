    "strongly correlated one - dimensional ( @xmath0 ) quantum liquids and gases are nowadays available in a large number of different laboratory systems ranging from single - wall carbon nanotubes  @xcite to semiconductor nanowires  @xcite , conducting molecules  @xcite , and trapped atomic gases  @xcite .",
    "chiral luttinger liquids at fractional quantum hall edges  @xcite also provide a beautiful example of @xmath0 conducting quantum liquids and have been the subject of intense experimental  @xcite and theoretical efforts  @xcite .",
    "there are two fundamental key features that are common to all these @xmath0 systems .",
    "( i ) independently of statistics , their effective low - energy description is based on a harmonic theory of long - wavelength fluctuations  @xcite due to the interplay between topology and interactions .",
    "( ii ) in the most interesting and exciting experimental situations the translational invariance of the liquid can be broken due to the presence of inhomogeneous external fields of different types , such as magnetic traps in the case of ultracold atomic gases  @xcite or hall bar constrictions in the case of fractional quantum hall edges  @xcite .",
    "these strong perturbations induce the appearance of new length scales causing novel physical behaviors relative to the corresponding unperturbed , translationally invariant model system .    a powerful theoretical tool to study the interplay between interactions and inhomogeneous external fields of arbitrary shape is density - functional theory ( dft )  , which is based on the hohenberg - kohn theorem  @xcite and on the kohn - sham mapping to an auxiliary noninteracting system  @xcite .",
    "many - body effects enter dft _ via _ the exchange - correlation ( xc ) functional , which is often treated by the local - density approximation ( lda )  .",
    "the essence of lda is to locally approximate the xc energy of the inhomogeneous system under study with that of an interacting homogeneous reference fluid , whose correlations are transferred by the lda to the inhomogeneous system .",
    "for example , for inhomogeneous @xmath1 and @xmath2 electronic systems the underlying reference fluid is normally the homogeneous electron liquid ( el )  @xcite , whose xc energy is known to a high degree of numerical precision thanks to the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) technique  @xcite .",
    "however , these els are believed to be normal fermi liquids  @xcite over a very broad range of densities , whereas their @xmath0 analogue is described by the luttinger - liquid model  @xcite .",
    "thus inhomogeneous @xmath0 fermionic systems appear as an interesting example in which it is appropriate to change the reference system to one that possesses ground - state luttinger - liquid rather than fermi - liquid - type correlations  @xcite .",
    "several other examples have been discussed in the literature in which either the lda reference system is not an el or the auxiliary system of the kohn - sham mapping is not an assembly of noninteracting particles .",
    "kohn and co - workers have introduced the concept of the  edge electron gas \"  @xcite to study electronic edge regions where the single - particle wavefunctions evolve from oscillatory to evanescent . in the presence of broken gauge symmetry , such as in the superconducting state ,",
    "an appropriate reference system is the el in the presence of an external pairing field inducing superconducting correlations  @xcite .",
    "a related approach has also been proposed for bose - einstein - condensed systems  @xcite .",
    "similar in spirit to the above mentioned work on dft for the hubbard model , is dft for the heisenberg model , in which the reference system is a lattice of spins on equivalent sites  @xcite .",
    "finally , we mention spectral - dft  @xcite , in which the kohn - sham noninteracting system is replaced by a suitably chosen interacting system not handled _ via _ the usual lda . such departures from the standard el paradigm",
    "substantially expand the range of usefulness of dft in condensed - matter physics , but also demand the construction and investigation of new classes of functionals .",
    "the present work is concerned with the testing of lda - type density functionals for strongly correlated @xmath0 ultracold fermi gases confined inside an optical lattice .    from the experimental point of view such systems , which are highly tunable and ideally clean ,",
    "are attracting a great deal of interdisciplinary interest because they allow to realize strongly interacting many - body systems through the manipulation of relevant degrees of freedom other than the bare atom - atom interaction , such as the well depth of the optical lattice that allows to tune the relative strength of hopping to on - site repulsion / attraction  @xcite .",
    "in particular the study of these systems may help us understand a number of phenomena that have been predicted in solid - state and condensed - matter physics .",
    "several effects , known in these subfields of physics for decades , have already been observed and quantitatively analyzed in ultracold atomic gases trapped in optical lattices .",
    "two beautiful examples are the bloch oscillations under an applied force in a @xmath0 optical lattice  @xcite and the superfluid - to - mott insulator transition of a bose - einstein condensate in a @xmath2 optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "typical @xmath0 quantum phenomena have also been observed in both bose and fermi gases .",
    "for instance , in the work of paredes _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and of kinoshita _ et al . _",
    "@xcite a @xmath3 gas has been used to realize experimentally a tonks - girardeau system  @xcite .",
    "the more recent preparation of two - component @xmath4 fermi gases in a quasi-@xmath0 geometry  @xcite provides a unique possibility to experimentally study phenomena that were predicted a long time ago for electrons in a @xmath0 solid - state environment , such as spin - charge separation in luttinger liquids  @xcite and charge - density waves in luther - emery liquids  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we focus our attention on a particular @xmath0 lattice system of ultracold atoms : a two - component fermi gas with repulsive intercomponent interactions in the presence of static external potentials that break the lattice translational invariance .",
    "theoretical studies of this model have been carried out both by numerical techniques  @xcite and by lda - based calculations  @xcite that will be discussed in detail later in this work . building upon the earlier ideas described in refs .",
    ", we here employ a lattice dft scheme in which the xc potential is determined exactly at the lda level through the bethe - ansatz solution of the homogeneous @xmath0 hubbard model .",
    "the results are tested against accurate qmc simulation data over a broad range of values for the hubbard on - site interaction , the number of atoms and lattice sites , and different types of external potential .",

    "the aim of this appendix is to present a summary of the two key results of soft @xcite : ( i ) the hohenberg - kohn theorem and ( ii ) the kohn - sham mapping to an auxiliary noninteracting system .",
    "the basic variable of soft is the site - occupation @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is a generic many - body state . as in standard dft ,",
    "the central result of soft is the hohenberg - kohn ( hk ) theorem , which can be summarized in three key statements : ( a ) the gs expectation value of any observable @xmath117 is a unique functional @xmath118 $ ] of the gs site - occupation @xmath71 ; ( b ) the gs site - occupation minimizes the total - energy functional @xmath119 $ ] ; and ( c ) @xmath119 $ ] can be written as @xmath120={\\cal f}_{\\rm hk}[n]+\\sum_{i}v_{\\rm ext}(z_i)n(z_i)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath121=\\langle\\psi|{\\hat { \\cal t}}+{\\hat { \\cal h}}_{\\rm int}|\\psi\\rangle$ ] is a _",
    "universal _ functional of the site occupation , in the sense that it does not depend on the external potential .",
    "part ( b ) of the hk theorem suggests that if the exact analytical expression of @xmath121 $ ] was known , the gs energy and the gs site occupation could be found by solving the euler - lagrange equation @xmath122}{\\delta n(z_i)}+v_{\\rm ext}(z_i)={\\rm constant}\\,,\\ ] ] the constant having the meaning of a lagrange multiplier to enforce particle - number conservation .",
