    "precise determinations of the strong coupling constant are important for strong interaction phenomenology and searches for new physics .",
    "lattice qcd provides a good methodology for such a determination  @xcite .",
    "the staggered quark formulation allows for much faster simulation of dynamical quarks than other formulations .",
    "it maintains a remnant chiral symmetry at the cost of not entirely removing the doublers , which appear as additional ` tastes ' of quarks .",
    "the presence of the doublers gives rise to large lattice artefacts through taste - changing interactions .",
    "the realisation that these can be systematically reduced by a symanzik improvement programme opens the way to generating ensembles with light dynamical quarks and small lattice artefacts .",
    "the milc collaboration have generated a number of dynamical ensembles using the asqtad action for the dynamical quarks and either 2 dynamical flavors , 3 degenerate dynamical flavors or 2 degenerate plus 1 heavier dynamical flavors , which should be close to the real world  @xcite . in the 2 + 1 flavor case",
    "they have been able to reduce the light dynamical mass to 1/5 of the heavier one ( which is approximately at @xmath1 ) .",
    "the asqtad staggered action includes a set of staples in place of the simple 1-link derivative , to suppress gluon exchange with momentum @xmath2 which couples the tastes together .",
    "these staples include a correction for low - momentum @xmath3 artefacts introduced by this procedure .",
    "in addition there is a 3-link derivative ( naik ) term to improve rotational discretisation errors through @xmath3 .",
    "the asqtad action then has @xmath4 rotational errors and @xmath5 taste - symmetry breaking interactions .",
    "this is combined in milc ensembles with a gluon action improved to the level of @xmath5 discretisation errors .",
    "we have calculated the @xmath6 spectrum on these ensembles using the nrqcd action for the @xmath7 quark  @xcite .",
    "the physics of the bottomonium ( @xmath6 ) system is that of non - relativistic @xmath7 quarks ( @xmath8 10% ) and so the nrqcd action is appropriate  @xcite .",
    "we use a hamiltonian correct through @xmath9 where all terms are tadpole - improved using an estimate of the landau gauge link  @xcite . for the purposes of determining the lattice spacing to set the scale for @xmath10 we need only the radial and orbital excitation energies .",
    "these are experimentally well - determined and have the advantage that they are to a good approximation independent of heavy quark mass so that sophisticated tuning of the @xmath7 mass is not necessary .",
    "in addition they are good probes of the dynamical quark content of the theory because the @xmath6 has no valence light quarks .",
    "the leading contribution to the radial and orbital splittings is at @xmath11@xmath12 and so the expected systematic error from higher order ( e.g. @xmath13 or @xmath14 ) terms not included in the nrqcd action is expected to be at the 1% level . the splittings can be determined very precisely on the lattice because of the speed of nrqcd correlator calculations .",
    "we use the perturbative expansion of the plaquette in terms of a physically well - motivated coupling , @xmath15 , defined from the heavy quark potential : @xmath16 we then define @xmath17 by the following expansion of the logarithm of the plaquette , where @xmath18 is equal to @xmath19 to the order ( second ) to which we are working here .",
    "@xmath20\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the numbers in brackets indicate numerical uncertainties in the perturbative coefficients from the numerical integration involved in their calculation .",
    "this perturbative expansion is for 1-loop symanzik - improved gluon action using tadpole - improvement with @xmath21 from the plaquette and @xmath22 flavors of aqtad improved staggered quarks , as appropriate to the milc ensembles .",
    "the scale , @xmath23 , is set using the blm scheme and is @xmath24 in this case .",
    "the perturbative expansion is well - behaved and shows small corrections for non - zero @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath18 can be converted to @xmath25 using the equality of @xmath18 and @xmath19 and the continuum relation between @xmath19 and @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26\\ ] ]",
    "figure 1 shows results for @xmath18 evolved to a common ( and arbitrarily chosen ) physical scale of 8.2 gev for various milc ensembles .",
    "notice the clear separation of results for @xmath27 , 2 and 3 .",
    "the figure shows results using either the @xmath6 orbital splitting or radial splitting to set the lattice spacing .",
    "the orbital splitting is calculated from the energy difference between the @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) and @xmath30 ( @xmath6 ) states on the lattice . the experimental result for the @xmath28 mass",
    "is not known and so is taken as the spin - average of the masses of the @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) states .",
    "the difference is expected to be very small .",
    "the radial splitting is the difference in energies of the @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) and @xmath30 states , which is experimentally well - known .",
    "the value for @xmath35 agrees well between the two determinations on the 2 + 1 dynamical ensemble but not on the others .",
    "this reflects the fact that the lattice spacing will depend on the quantity chosen to fix it if the vacuum does not have dynamical content which is close enough to the ` real world ' .",
    "we can take the result for @xmath18 on the 2 + 1 dynamical ensemble , convert to @xmath25 and run to @xmath36 .",
    "the result for @xmath37 is then 0.121(3 ) .",
    "the dominant source of error ( 0.002 ) is the perturbative error from unknown higher orders in perturbation theory in eq .",
    "this result agrees with the world average and with our previous results using dynamical ( unimproved ) staggered quarks  @xcite .",
    "other sources of systematic error give small effects .",
    "we can see from figure 1 that the @xmath22 = 3 results show very little dependence on dynamical light quark mass .",
    "extrapolating @xmath18 with @xmath38 would change the final result by less than 0.001 .",
    "the lattice spacing dependence of the result is expected to be very small but we currently have @xmath6 results only on the coarser of the milc set of ensembles .",
    "we can estimate the dependence from other results , however .",
    "figure 2 shows the dependence of @xmath18 in the quenched approximation on @xmath3 for improved and unimproved glue  @xcite .",
    "here we have used @xmath39 to set the scale ( and quote @xmath18 at a scale of @xmath40 ) because it can be fixed very precisely .",
    "its disadvantage is that it is not clear how to convert it to a physical result .",
    "the figure shows that unimproved glue has very small dependence on @xmath41 and improved glue ( appropriate to the milc ensembles ) even less .",
    "we fold this lattice spacing dependence along with quark mass effects above and nrqcd systematics into a final error of 0.003 .",
    "the first calculation of @xmath10 with 2 + 1 flavours of dynamical quarks gives results in agreement with previous work , but without extrapolating in @xmath22 .",
    "further improvements , including the calculation of the next order in perturbation theory , are planned to reduce the error even further .",
