    "landau theory of the fermi liquid ( fl ) @xcite is by now one of the most established theories describing a system of interacting fermions .",
    "the main statement of this theory is that the low energy behavior of the system is similar to that for the ideal fermi gas .",
    "this gives a possibility to discuss experimental systems omitting the interactions and using phenomenological constants for the effective mass of the particles , density of states at the fermi surface and other physical quantities .    a phenomenological description of the fl developed in the first works landau was supported by a diagrammatic analysis @xcite , which was a very good confirmation",
    "however , the microscopic landau theory of ref .",
    "@xcite is based on a very strong assumption that one can single out a singular particle - hole channel and sum proper ladder diagrams .",
    "irreducible vertices entering the ladder diagrams should remain finite and be analytic in the limit of small momenta and frequencies .",
    "it is generally believed that for a fermi gas with repulsion this assumption is correct and such a system should behave as the fermi liquid in dimensions @xmath1 .",
    "of course , the similarity between the fl and ideal fermi gas can not be exact and there should be corrections at finite temperatures , frequencies or momenta .",
    "study of unconventional metals like high temperature superconductors , heavy fermion materials , etc . , have revealed considerable deviations of their properties from those predicted by the fl . as a result , quite a few theoretical works have appeared recently where the landau fl theory was discussed  @xcite .",
    "the corrections to physical quantities become especially interesting when they are non - analytic functions of temperature , frequency or momentum .",
    "this means that physical quantities like @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the specific heat and @xmath4 is the temperature , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the spin susceptibility , etc .",
    ", can not be represented at low temperatures as a series in @xmath7 , which contrasts the ideal fermi gas .",
    "such non - analytical corrections were studied in a number of publications using diagrammatic expansions in the electron - electron interaction  eliash , doniach , brink , amit , belitz , coffey , chubukov1,sarma , chubukov2,chubukov3,chubukov4 . as a result of this investigation ,",
    "it is well known by now that in @xmath8 the next - to - leading term in @xmath9 is proportional to @xmath10 @xcite . in @xmath11",
    "the non - analytical corrections to @xmath9 and @xmath12 scale as @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively ( @xmath15 is the wave vector of the external magnetic field ) coffey , chubukov1,sarma , chubukov2,chubukov3,chubukov4,catelani .",
    "the existence of the non - analytic corrections to the physical quantities is not accidental .",
    "in fact , all the singular corrections to the thermodynamic quantities may be understood in terms of contributions of low lying collective excitations , see e.g. , refs . @xcite . at the same time , explicit calculations with the conventional diagrammatic technique are not simple already in the lowest orders of the perturbation theory .",
    "therefore , selecting diagrams in order to group them into the collective modes is a rather difficult task .    in this paper",
    "we present a new method of calculations for a clean fermi gas with a repulsion that enables us to integrate out  electron degrees of freedom in the beginning of all calculations and reduce the initial fermionic model to a model of low lying excitations .",
    "the method is based on using equations for quasiclassical green functions and includes both the density and spin excitations .",
    "we call loosely our method _ bosonization _ but it differs from earlier higher dimensional bosonization schemes haldane , houghton1,houghton , neto , kopietz , kopietzb , khveshchenko , khveshchenko1,metzner based on the assumption a long range electron - electron interaction . as a result ,",
    "only density excitations were considered , while the spin excitations were not included in those schemes ( to be more precise , the spin excitations are not affected by the long range interaction and therefore they were not included to the scheme ) .",
    "the density excitations are described by a scalar function and the effective interaction @xmath16 between them vanishes in the limit @xmath17 this means that the interaction may lead only to a renormalization of parameters characterizing physical quantities ( unless  @xmath16 is long ranged ) but not to new effects . in other words , the bosonization of haldane , houghton1,houghton , neto , kopietz , kopietzb , khveshchenko",
    ", khveshchenko1,metzner enables one to reduce a system with a long range interaction to a model of free bosons , which is very similar to writing the tomonaga - luttinger model for one dimensional electron systems ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this method is often referred to as bosonization .",
    "what we want to present now is a scheme that enables one to consider for arbitrary interactions both the density and spin excitations on equal footing .",
    "the relevant variable describing the spin excitations is a @xmath18 matrix and our method resembles to some extent a non - abelian bosonization .",
    "the effective interaction between the spin excitations does not vanish in the limit @xmath19 and leads to new logarithmic contributions to scattering amplitudes coming from low energies of the order of @xmath4 . as a result ,",
    "physical quantities depend on the logarithmically renormalized amplitudes , which changes their temperature dependence .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the infrared  logarithmic divergencies that we find in the limit @xmath20 exist in _ any _ dimensions ( including @xmath21 ) and have nothing in common with the ultraviolet  logarithmic divergency ( divergency originating from short distances ) discussed for @xmath22 systems long ago galitskii .",
    "the latter does not lead to any additional dependence on temperature and can be absorbed into parameters characterizing fl .",
    "_  _    we display in the subsequent sections the main idea of our method and new results that have been obtained recently . in sec.[excitations ] we make a hubbard - stratonovich transformation and derive quasiclassical equations for the density and spin excitations representing their solution in terms of an integral over supervectors .",
    "the interaction between the spin excitations gives logarithms that are summed in sec.[field theory ] using a new renormalization group ( rg ) scheme .",
    "we calculate the specific heat and spin susceptibility in sec.[thermodynamics ] and discuss the results in sec.[discussion ] .    the method and",
    "the calculation of the specific heat has been presented for the first time in ref .",
    "@xcite . using this method the calculation of the spin susceptibility",

    "in this section we show how one can reduce calculation of the partition function of the interacting fermions to calculation of the partition function of the density and spin excitations .",

    "the fact that the forward scattering amplitude drops out from the final results corresponds to what happens in @xmath425 .    although we have agreement in the limiting cases with almost all the results we could compare with , there is a disagreement with an old work @xcite , where an instability of the fermi liquid against superconducting pairing with a high angular momentum was found .",
    "this is especially strange because the main contribution to the formation of the superconductivity comes from almost parallel electron motion such that only forward and backward scattering enter the superconducting critical temperature .",
    "this is just the region that we considered . as we do not see any such effect",
    ", this can mean that either 1 ) the accuracy of our method is not sufficient ( we summed the terms like @xmath462 whereas @xmath463 were summed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) or 2 ) summing the cooper ladder as was done in ref .",
    "@xcite is a bad approximation for the quasi - one - dimensional process .",
    "we believe that 2 ) is the explanation of the contradiction but a more careful analysis should be performed .    we have developed and applied the bosonization scheme for the simplest model of the interacting fermi gas .",
    "one can add other terms to the hamiltonian of this model to take into account different features relevant for experimental systems .",
    "we hope that our scheme may be useful in this study .",
