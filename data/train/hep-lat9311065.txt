    "the task of measuring the qcd coupling constant at energies of the order of a few gevs is a major challenge for the lattice community , because of the deep phenomenological and fundamental implications of such a measurement .",
    "many different methods have been proposed to do this , based on the study of the interquark static potential , charmonium spectra and other quantites @xcite . in spite of the success of some of these methods ( at least when applied in the quenched approximation ) , it would be desirable to exploit a more fundamental definition of the coupling constant , arising from the lattice study of some fundamental qcd interaction vertex , and compare such a direct determination of the coupling with what is obtained from different methods .",
    "we discuss here some preliminary results in this direction .    in general , the lattice study of gluon ( and quark ) correlation functions",
    "provides a valuable tool to gain insight into the non - perturbative qcd dynamics at the fundamental level .",
    "in fact , in this approach one deals with the fundamental degrees of freedom of the theory , assuming we are sufficiently close to the continuum limit .    using a lattice definition of the gluon , in principle one can evaluate any unrenormalized , complete @xmath0-point green s function for the gluon ( we omit lorentz indices ) : @xmath1 or , in momentum space : @xmath2 once @xmath3 and @xmath4 are determined ,",
    "many interesting issues can be investigated .",
    "firstly , the non - perturbative behaviour of the gluon propagator @xmath5 , which has been analyzed by many authors in different approaches @xcite , yet it is still poorly understood . secondly , from @xmath6 and @xmath7 one can define non - perturbatively the lattice version of the amputated , 1pi 3-gluon vertex function : @xmath8^{-1 }   \\label{eq : ampu}\\ ] ] evaluating the above quantity is the crucial step in order to define the qcd coupling constant from the lattice 3-gluon vertex , as we explain in the following .    in order to determine a convenient kinematical setup",
    ", we consider the general form of the continuum , off - shell 3-gluon vertex @xcite .",
    "such an expression contains 6 independent scalar functions , but for the purpose of computing the coupling constant renormalization one only needs to determine the function which multiplies the tree - level vertex .",
    "of course this is the only one which is divergent when the uv cutoff is removed .",
    "if one evaluates the continuum vertex function @xmath9 at the `` asymmetric '' point defined by @xmath10 then it can be written as @xmath11 the above expression is proportional to the continuum tree - level vertex evaluated at ( [ eq : asy ] ) , and the proportionality factor @xmath12 diverges when removing the uv cutoff .",
    "one can show that the leading term of the 1-loop lattice calculation of the 3-gluon vertex for the same kinematics is indeed consistent with ( [ eq : baba ] ) @xcite .",
    "thus we decide to calculate the lattice vertex function @xmath13 at ( [ eq : asy ] ) and we set ( neglecting terms of higher order in the external momentum ) : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the lattice spacing .",
    "then , when @xmath16 , one can set @xmath17 for a generic momentum @xmath18 . finally ,",
    "following @xcite , we define the renormalized , `` running '' coupling as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is obtained from the relation @xmath21 with @xmath22 being the projector on transverse fields ( we will work in the landau gauge ) .",
    "the first step in the above program is the evaluation of @xmath3 .",
    "the lattice gluon field can be defined as @xcite : @xmath23 earlier lattice studies of @xmath24 @xcite reported evidence of an effective gluon mass which increases with the time separation , for short time intervals .",
    "more recently , the evaluation of @xmath25 has allowed a more detailed investigation of the mechanism of dynamical gluon mass generation and other non - perturbative phenomena @xcite .",
    "our group @xcite evaluated @xmath26 and @xmath3 on different sets of ( quenched ) configurations with @xmath27 ranging between 5.7 and 6.3 .    for the purpose of defining the amputated vertex function ,",
    "the most convenient set of configurations among the ones considered in @xcite is the set of 25 configurations on a @xmath28 lattice at @xmath29 .",
    "this because it meets requirements of good statistics , low infrared cutoff and stable data for the propagator ( see fig.[fig:2point ] ) .",
    "all the numerical results shown here refer to such set of configurations .",
    "all the calculations are performed after gauge - fixing to the so - called minimal landau gauge @xcite ( see @xcite for a short review ) , implemented through the iterative minimization of @xmath30 \\equiv - { 1 \\over v } \\sum_{n , \\mu } \\ re \\ tr \\",
    "\\left ( u_{\\mu}^{g } ( n ) + u_{\\mu}^{g \\dagger } ( n- \\hat{\\mu } ) \\right )   \\label{eq : effecl}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the lattice volume and @xmath32 indicates the gauge - transformed link @xmath33 .",
    "after calculating the propagator , we proceed to the evaluation of the complete 3-point function @xmath34 .",
    "we set @xmath35 , @xmath36 , to be able to inject momentum in the longer ( time ) lattice direction , and we call @xmath37 the injected momentum",
    ".    as expected , the numerical results are consistent with an odd function of @xmath37 ( see fig.[fig:3pointcompl ] ) . for large values of @xmath37",
    "it gets damped , as a result of the propagators in momentum space corresponding to the external legs . at this point , in order to define the amputated vertex function , we multiply the complete 3-point function shown above by the inverse propagators , according to ( [ eq : ampu ] ) .    the resulting function @xmath38 is shown in fig.[fig : amputated ] , where the error is a jackknife one the amputated vertex function looks roughly proportional to the external momentum , as expected from 1-loop calculations .",
    "we have discussed a method to measure on the lattice the 3-gluon vertex function and to define from it the running coupling constant .",
    "preliminary numerical results suggest that the vertex function can indeed be non - perturbatively defined and measured .",
    "a careful analysis of the role of ir and uv lattice artifacts is needed .",
    "in particular , having defined the coupling at a point in momentum space where one of the external momenta is zero , it will be crucial to investigate finite volume effects .",
