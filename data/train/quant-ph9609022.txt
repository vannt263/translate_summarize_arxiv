    "contemporary applications of the einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) correlations @xcite and the bell inequality @xcite range from purely philosophical problems to quantum cryptography , computation and teleportation .    in the cryptographic scheme proposed by ekert @xcite alice and bob test for eavesdropping by measuring the average of the  bell observable \" @xmath1 where @xmath2 etc .",
    "no \" observables ( say , signs of spin for electrons , or planes of polarization for photons ) .",
    "quantum mechanics predicts that for some choices of such observables one can obtain @xmath3 . in an ideal situation",
    "a result of the form @xmath4 indicates that at least some pairs of particles were not prepared in the singlet state and this indicates an eavesdropper .",
    "practical applicability of quantum cryptographic protocols crucially depends on detector efficiencies . in typical bell - type photon pair experiments",
    "the efficiencies were smaller than @xmath5 .",
    "the advent of solid state photodiodes provides efficiencies of detection which are much higher @xcite but still far from ideal .",
    "an almost ideal experimental scheme has been recently discussed by fry _",
    "@xcite who propose to replace photons with massive particles ( pairs of @xmath6hg atoms ) .",
    "detection efficiency is then at least @xmath7 and can be pushed to more than @xmath8 .",
    "an obvious drawback of such a communication channel is that it is slow . to make it faster one",
    "might be tempted to use relativistic velocities .",
    "it will be shown below that for high velocities one may expect a surprising effect : the amount of violation of the bell inequality may decrease with growing velocity of the spin-1/2 particles .",
    "alice and bob must therefore additionally know the velocity distribution of the particle beam .",
    "otherwise they may be confused and  detect an eavesdropper \" even though the particles remain in a pure zero - helicity singlet state .",
    "the effect is related to the old problem described already in 1930 by schrdinger @xcite . as is widely known e.  schrdinger examined the behavior of the coordinate operator @xmath9 associated with dirac s equation and discovered the oscillatory motion he called the _",
    "zitterbewegung_. the _ zitterbewegung _ takes place with respect to the _ center - of - mass _ position operator @xmath10 and this is the operator which should be used to define a physically meaningful spin operator .",
    "the situation is not typical only of the dirac equation and is not associated with the presence of negative energy solutions as one is sometimes led to believe .",
    "the so - called new dirac equation generalized by mukunda _",
    "_ @xcite admits only positive - energy solutions but the _ zitterbewegung _ is present and the associated center - of - mass operator is algebraically identical to this implied by schrdinger s analysis of the dirac equation @xcite .",
    "the analysis presented in @xcite shows clearly that in order to obtain a physically consistent model of an extended hadron one has to proceed in the way identical to the one chosen in this paper : first define the center - of - mass operator @xmath11 , then introduce the angular momentum @xmath12 , and finally define spin by @xmath13 .    in what follows",
    "i use a group representation formulation , elements of which can be found in the 1965 papers by fleming @xcite .",
    "the group theoretic approach has the advantage of being applicable to any physical system whose symmetry group is the poincar group , or whose symmetry group contains the poincar group as a subgroup .",
    "let us begin with generators of the unitary , infinite dimensional irreducible representation of the poincar group corresponding to a nonzero mass @xmath14 and spin @xmath15 .",
    "their standard form is @xcite @xmath16 here s denotes finite dimensional angular momentum matrices corresponding to the @xmath17-dimensional representation @xmath18 of the rotation group .",
    "similar forms are obtained if one uses the hadronic representation introduced in @xcite .",
    "the poincar group has two casimir operators : the squared mass and the square of the pauli - lubanski vector @xmath19 .",
    "the latter operator written in the above representation is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the unit vector pointing in the momentum direction and @xmath22 the center - of - mass position operator which generalizes to any representation the operator @xmath10 of schrdinger is @xmath23 this operator extends naturally also to massless fields and can be shown to be uniquely ( up to subtleties with domains of unbounded operators ) derived from symmetry considerations in the case of the maxwell field @xcite . in the maxwell field case , the formula ( [ conn ] )",
    "can be regarded as defining a connection on a light cone .",
    "a parallel transport with respect to this connection can be shown to generate a berry phase @xcite .",
    "orbital angular momentum and spin corresponding to @xmath11 were given by pryce and fleming @xcite @xmath24 @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a velocity of the particle .",
    "( [ s - w ] ) shows that relativistic spin is closely related to the pauli - lubanski vector .",
    "projection of spin in a direction given by the unit vector @xmath27 commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath28 and equals @xmath29\\cdot{\\bbox s}\\\\ & = & \\bigl[\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}\\bbox a_\\perp + \\bbox a_\\parallel\\bigr]\\cdot \\bbox s= : \\bbox \\alpha(\\bbox a,\\bbox p)\\cdot{\\bbox s}. \\label{9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the latter equality defines the vector @xmath30 whose length is @xmath31 the eigenvalues of @xmath32 are therefore @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "the eigenvalues of the pauli - lubanski vector projections are therefore @xmath35 . in the infinite momentum / massless limit",
    "the eigenvalues of the relativistic spin in a direction perpendicular to @xmath36 vanish , which can be regarded as a consequence of the lorentz flattenning of the moving particle ( in these limits @xmath37 ) .",
    "projection of spin on the momentum direction is equal to the helicity , i.e. @xmath38 for any @xmath39 , and @xmath40 in the rest frame ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "bacry @xcite observed that a nonrelativistic limit of @xmath11 leads to a correct form of the spin - orbit interaction in the pauli equation if one uses potentials @xmath42 instead of @xmath43 @xcite ; an analogous effect was described in @xcite where the internal angular momentum of the _ zitterbewegung _ leads to spin with the correct @xmath44 factor .",
    "an algebraic curiosity is the fact that the components of @xmath45 satisfy an algebra which is @xmath46 in the rest frame and formally contracts to the euclidean @xmath47 in the infinite momentum / massless limit , and thus provides an interesting alternative explanation of the privileged role played by the euclidean group in the theory of massless fields @xcite .    in spite of all these facts",
    "suggestng that both @xmath11 and @xmath45 are natural candidates for physical observables no experimental tests distinguishing them from other definitions of position and spin have been proposed so far . obviously , it is not easy to test directly @xmath11 which , representing the center of mass , may be expected to couple to the gravitational field .",
    "the spin operator , on the other hand , is responsible for the magnetic moment and should couple to the electromagnetic field which is much stronger .    consider now a stern - gerlach - type measurement involving spin-1/2 relativistic particles and assume that @xmath45 is the physical internal angular momentum which is measured in this experiment @xcite . assume also that we have two spin-1/2 particles in a singlet state ( total helicity equals zero ) and propagating in the same direction with identical momenta @xmath36 ( to be more precise one should take wave packets in momentum space , but for simplicity assume that they are sufficiently well localized around momenta @xmath36 , so that we can approximate them by plane waves ) : @xmath48 the kets @xmath49 form the _ helicity _ basis . consider the binary operators @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "their eigenvalues are @xmath52 .",
    "the relativistic corrections that arise are those resulting from the modification of the spin direction as  seen \" by a measuring device .",
    "the average of the relativistic epr - bohm - bell operator is @xmath53 } \\sqrt{1+\\beta^2\\bigl[(\\bbox n\\cdot\\bbox b)^2 - 1\\bigr]}}\\label{ab}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there are several interesting particular cases of the formula ( [ ab ] ) .",
    "first , if @xmath54 , @xmath55 then @xmath56 which is the nonrelativistic result .",
    "this case will never occur in a realistic experiment since localization of detectors will lead to a momentum spread . if @xmath57 , @xmath58 then in the ultrarelativistic case @xmath59 @xmath60 independently of the choice of @xmath27 , @xmath61 .",
    "it is easy to intuitively understand this result : in the ultrarelativistic limit projections of spin in directions perpendicular to the momentum vanish for both particles and spins are ( anti)parallel to the momentum .",
    "the most striking case occurs if @xmath27 and @xmath61 are perpendicular and the nonrelativistic average is 0 .",
    "let @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "then @xmath64 this average is 0 in the rest frame ( @xmath65 ) and @xmath66 for @xmath67 .",
    "any observable deviation from 0 in an epr - bohm type experiment would be an indication that the operators @xmath45 and @xmath11 are physically correct observables and that massive spin-1/2 particles are extended in the sense that centers of mass and charge do not coincide .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows that ( [ 19 ] ) describes a relativistic effect that is even stronger than the lorentz contraction or the time delay ( both are proportional to @xmath68 ) .",
    "one pecularity of @xmath11 is that its components do not commute for nonzero spins .",
    "an uncertainty principle guarantees therefore that such a particle can not be localized at a point @xcite , or is extended in some nonclassical sense , a property that can not be without implications for the renormalization and self - energy problems .",
    "the definition of @xmath69 implies also that the center of mass does not transform as a spatial component of a four - vector .",
    "this apparently counter - intuitive result agrees however with the classical analysis of mller @xcite who showed that the center of mass of a spinning classical body is not a component of a four vector .",
    "these interesting properties seem unavoidable and can be proved in various ways at both quantum and classical levels ( for their classical derivations see @xcite ) .",
    "consider now the vectors @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 leading to the the maximal violation of the bell inequality in nonrelativistic domain .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the dependence of the average ( [ bell ] ) on @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the average ( [ bell ] ) for @xmath77 as a function of the spherical angles and for @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "these results show clearly that the information about the degree of violation of the bell inequality is not sufficient for determining purity of a massive two - particle zero - helicity state .",
    "additionally one has to know the momentum distribution of the particle beam .",
    "the relation between @xmath19 and @xmath45 is similar to the one between the 4-velocity @xmath80 and the 3-velocity @xmath81 .",
    "the casimir operator @xmath82 equals @xmath83 if an irreducible representation of the poincar group is considered . for this reason it is typical to define the spin 4-vector as @xmath84 where @xmath80 is the 4-velocity . in the rest frame @xmath85 and @xmath86 which seems to justify this choice . for a moving particle",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath87 are @xmath88 where @xmath89 denote the respective eigenvalues of @xmath90 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath87 therefore tend to @xmath91 in the infinite momentum limit which is unphysical for a spin observable .",
    "nothing of that kind occurs if one divides @xmath92 by _ energy _ and _ not by mass _ which again selects our spin operator as a candidate for a physical observable",
    ".    nevertheless , irrespective of this subtlety , the relativistic eprb average is the same for both @xmath45 and @xmath93 since we consider a  yes - no \" observable which is obtained by _ normalization _ of eigenvalues to @xmath52 .",
    "this is another reason to believe that the discussed suppression of degree of the bell inequality violation is a physical phenomenon that should be observable in experiments with massive particles .",
    "just for the sake of completeness let us compare the general formulas to the analogous calculations performed for the dirac electrons @xcite .",
    "the pauli - lubanski vector is @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the dirac free hamiltonian and @xmath96 is the spinor part of the generator of rotations .",
    "the relativistic spin operator is therefore equal to @xmath97 here @xmath98 is the sign - of - energy operator and @xmath99 project on states of given signs of energy .",
    "it follows that @xmath45 is the so - called even part of the spinor part of the generator of rotations .",
    "this operator commutes with @xmath95 and hence can be used for analyzing the eprb experiment @xcite .",
    "the explicit form of this observable in units with @xmath100 and @xmath101 is @xmath102 @xmath103 where @xmath104 are dirac matrices .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath105 are given by ( [ as ] ) with @xmath106 .",
    "the corresponding positive - energy eigenstates in the standard representation are @xmath107 where @xmath108 satisfies @xmath109 , and @xmath110 .",
    "i have remarked that a positive verification of the relativistic center - of - mass concept would indicate that nonzero spin relativistic particles are extended .",
    "the example of the dirac equation illustrates this idea .",
    "consider again the spinor part of the generator of rotations @xmath111 .",
    "it does not commute with @xmath95 and satisfies in the heisenberg picture the precession equation @xmath112 where @xmath113 . for massive fields @xmath114 does not commute with @xmath95 and",
    "hence can be decomposed into even and odd parts .",
    "the even part is @xmath115 @xmath116 reduces to @xmath114 in both massless and infinite - momentum limits .",
    "a hamiltonian of a particle moving with velocity @xmath117 can now be expressed as @xmath118 where each of the operators appearing in @xmath95 is even and commuting with @xmath95 .",
    "the form ( [ nh ] ) is analogous to the one discussed in @xcite .",
    "the limiting form @xmath119 is characteristic of all massless fields , where for higher spins the equation ( [ prec ] ) is still valid , but angular velocities for a given momentum are smaller the greater the helicity .",
    "the new form of the hamiltonian leads to the following observation .",
    "notice that for massless fields the hamiltonian can be written in either of the following two forms @xmath120 or @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the velocity operator for a general massless field ( @xmath123 in case of the dirac equation ) and @xmath124 is its even part .",
    "we recognize here the classical mechanical rule for a transition from a point - like description to the extended - object - like one : linear momentum goes into angular momentum , linear velocity into angular velocity , and vice versa .",
    "the third part of this rule ( mass  moment of inertia ) can be naturally postulated as follows @xmath125 where ( [ h3 ] ) defines the kinetic mass @xmath126 and the kinetic moment of inertia @xmath127 of the massless field .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath128 for massless fields of helicity @xmath129 [ corresponding to the @xmath130 spinor representation of @xmath131 is , in ordinary units , @xmath132 the equation @xmath133 characteristic , by the way , of circular strings ( here with mass @xmath134 ) defines some radius which is equal to @xmath135 which can be expressed also as a form of the uncertainty principle @xmath136 the center - of - mass commutation relation @xmath137=-i\\hbar\\epsilon_{klm}s_m / p_0 ^ 2\\ ] ] leads in the massless case to the uncertainty relations of the type @xmath138 it is remarkable that the same radius occurs naturally in the twistor formulation of massless fields @xcite .",
    "it is known that although spin-0 twistors can be represented geometrically by null straight lines , this does not hold for spin-@xmath139 , @xmath140 , twistors @xcite . instead of the straight line we get a congruence of twisting , null , shear - free world lines , the so - called robinson congruence . a three - dimensional projection of this congruence consits of _ circles _ , whose radii are given exactly by our formula ( [ rad ] ) ( cf .  the footnote at p.  62 in @xcite ) .",
    "the circles propagate with velocity of light in the momentum direction and rotate in the right- or left - handed sense depending on the sign of helicity .",
    "the same construction can be performed for the massive dirac particle if one uses @xmath141 .",
    "the main idea advocated in this paper can be summarized as follows .",
    "consider _ some _ procedure leading to a measurement of a nonrelativistic spin @xcite .",
    "this procedure is based on a black box giving results  yes \" or  no \" for spins equal to , respectively , @xmath142 and @xmath143 . in the nonrelativistic domain",
    "the particles enter the device  slowly \" .",
    "imagine now that for some reasons we decide to use faster particles .",
    "the measured average may vary with the growing ( average ) velocity of the particle beam and , obviously , some result will be obtained .",
    "the question is how to calculate the result of such an experiment assuming that the procedure measures the spin itself and not the total angular momentum .",
    "many different definitions of relativistic spin exist in literature but all of them are momentum dependent @xcite .",
    "calculations based on the definition which seems the most physical ( _ via _ the relativistic center - of - mass ) show that relativistic corrections are nontrivial .",
    "their strength can be regarded as a combined influence of two independent relativistic phenomena : the lorentz contraction and the mller shift of the center of mass of a spinning body .",
    "the same result is obtained if one uses the spin operator defined _ via _ the pauli - lubanski vector .",
    "the effect can be in principle measured and will have to be taken into account in quantum cryptographic tests for eavesdropping if fast massive particles will be used for a key transfer .",

    "<S> two aspects of the relativistic version of the einstein - podolsky - rosen - bohm ( eprb ) experiment with massive particles are discussed : ( a ) a possibility of using the experiment as an implicit test of a relativistic center - of - mass concept , and ( b ) influence of the relativistic effects on degree of violation of the bell inequality . the nonrelativistic singlet state average @xmath0 is relativistically generalized by defining spin _ via _ the relativistic center - of - mass operator . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding eprb average contains relativistic corrections which are stronger in magnitude than standard relativistic phenomena such as the time delay , and can be measured in einstein - podolsky - rosen - bohm - type experiments with relativistic massive spin-1/2 particles . </S>",
    "<S> the degree of violation of the bell inequality is shown to depend on the velocity of the pair of spin-1/2 particles with respect to laboratory . </S>",
    "<S> experimental confirmation of the relativistic formula would indicate that for relativistic nonzero - spin particles centers of mass and charge do not coincide . </S>",
    "<S> the result may have implications for quantum cryptography based on massive particles .    </S>",
