    "magnetic excitations from the anomalous metallic phase of v@xmath4o@xmath5 and its derivatives have received continued interest for more than three decades in connection with a famous temperature - induced metal - insulator transition ( mit ) @xcite . among various methods to stabilize the metallic phase against the antiferromagnetic insulating ( afi ) phase , introducing v vacancies has extensively been studied in the last decade @xcite . while stoichiometric v@xmath4o@xmath5 remains paramagnetic",
    "once the metallic phase is stabilized by applying pressure @xcite , the ground state of metal - deficient v@xmath11o@xmath5 is a spin - density wave ( sdw ) state characterized by a small ordered moment ( @xmath100.15 @xmath12 ) with a large fluctuating component ( @xmath100.32 @xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath1v nmr , on the other hand , has revealed the existence of v@xmath14-like magnetic `` guest '' sites in v@xmath11o@xmath5 @xcite , indicating a spatially inhomogeneous electronic state which is suspected to be incompatible with homogeneous sdw order @xcite .",
    "substitution of ti for v also stabilizes the metallic phase , resulting in the sdw ground state similar to v@xmath11o@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "however , magnetic guest sites have not been detected yet in ti - doped v@xmath4o@xmath5 , which makes it a puzzle whether the sdw order is intrinsic to a homogeneous system or to the system with some sort of inhomogeneities like magnetic guests . in this paper",
    ", we report on the magnetic susceptibility and @xmath1v nmr measurements on ( v@xmath2ti@xmath3)@xmath4o@xmath5 near the mit phase boundary .",
    "we found the v@xmath8-like guest sites distinguishable from the host site in both the afi and paramagnetic metallic ( pm ) phases .",
    "the sdw order is therefore intrinsic to the _ doped _ v@xmath4o@xmath5 systems with a kind of magnetic impurities .",
    "powder samples of ( v@xmath2ti@xmath3)@xmath4o@xmath5 were prepared by arc - melting of v@xmath4o@xmath5 , ti and tio@xmath4 followed by annealing in h@xmath4 atmosphere at 950 @xmath15c for 48 hours .",
    "magnetic susceptibility was measured using a squid magnetometer .",
    "a clamp - type cu - be cell suited for the squid magnetometer @xcite was used for the measurement of the susceptibility under pressure .",
    "nmr measurements were carried out with a coherent - type pulsed spectrometer .",
    "figure  [ fig : suscept ] shows the temperature ( @xmath16 ) dependence of the magnetic susceptibility @xmath0 = @xmath17 ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 being the magnetization and the external field , respectively ) of ( v@xmath2ti@xmath3)@xmath4o@xmath5 measured at @xmath20 t on heating .",
    "the results are in good agreement with those reported in the literature @xcite except that @xmath0 for @xmath7 = 0.045 and 0.046 are somewhat larger than the others .",
    "this comes from a nonlinear increase of @xmath18-@xmath19 curves at low fields for these samples due to a trace of ferromagnetic impurities , of which existence does not affect seriously the determination of transition temperatures because their response to the external field is scarcely dependent on @xmath16 .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : suscept ] that a sudden drop of @xmath0 signaling mit disappears for @xmath21 .",
    "a kink then appears at low @xmath16 due to sdw ordering .",
    "the @xmath16-@xmath7 phase diagram is shown in fig.[fig : diagram ] .",
    "here we defined the mit temperature @xmath22 as a mid - point temperature of the rapid drop of @xmath0 due to mit .",
    "@xmath22 decreases with @xmath7 almost linearly to @xmath1060 k in a rate @xmath23 k / ti% and is terminated at the critical concentration @xmath6 . above @xmath24 ,",
    "nel temperature @xmath25 appears at @xmath1018 k and increases gradually with @xmath7 .",
    "the phase diagram clearly demonstrates that the mit in ( v@xmath2ti@xmath3)@xmath4o@xmath5 with changing @xmath7 is not quantum critical but is strongly first order .",
    "the bulk @xmath0 of ( v@xmath26ti@xmath27)@xmath4o@xmath5 under pressure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : press ] .",
    "the most striking feature of the result is that both the anomalies due to mit and sdw ordering are observable at 0.15 gpa .",
    "this suggests that the insulating and metallic phases coexist in some pressure region , i.e. , mit under pressure is first order as ti doping .",
    "the resulting @xmath16-@xmath28 phase diagram is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : press ] .",
    "applying pressure reduces @xmath22 in a rate @xmath29 k / gpa which yields a scaling 0.29 gpa @xmath30 ti% for the mit . as opposed to ti doping , @xmath25 is suppressed by pressure , but the rate @xmath31 k / gpa is only one - fifth of that in v@xmath11o@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "@xmath32 was found to decrease slightly with @xmath7 to @xmath33 k / gpa for @xmath34 .",
    "field - swept @xmath1v nmr spectra in the pm phase of ( v@xmath35ti@xmath36)@xmath4o@xmath5 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrapm ] .",
    "the spectrum is asymmetric with a tail at lower fields and is broadened significantly at low @xmath16 .",
    "the asymmetric line profile suggests the existence of v sites having different crystallographic and/or magnetic environment from that in pure v@xmath4o@xmath5 .",
    "we analyzed the spectrum by fitting to the sum of two voigt functions on the assumption that there exists another v site or the `` guest '' site in addition to the `` host '' site .",
    "the results are also shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : spectrapm ] .",
    "the intensity ratio between the host ( dashed line ) and the satellite ( dashed - dotted line corresponding to the guest ) resonances is about @xmath37 and is almost @xmath16-independent .",
    "this ratio can be understood by considering that the satellite signal at lower fields comes from v nuclei with at least one ti atom on the four neighboring v sites , because in that case the intensity ratio is @xmath38 , agreeing well with the observed one .",
    "the guest site should be in the v@xmath8-like electronic state as the host site , because ti atoms exist as trivalent ions in ( v@xmath2ti@xmath3)@xmath4o@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 dependence of the nmr shifts @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote host and guest , respectively ) at the v sites is shown in fig.[fig : shift ] .",
    "@xmath43 takes a maximum around 60 k , following the nmr shift of @xmath1v in v@xmath4o@xmath5 under pressure @xcite as in v@xmath11o@xmath5 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath44 decrease gradually with decreasing @xmath16 and exhibits an upturn below about 60 k. the different @xmath16 dependence of @xmath39 and @xmath40 indicates that the @xmath9-spin susceptibilities of host and guest sites behave rather differently .",
    "we also showed in fig .",
    "[ fig : shift ] the scale of the @xmath9-spin susceptibility @xmath45 for the observed shift @xmath46 calculated using the relation @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) . here",
    "@xmath49 is the shift due to van - vleck orbital susceptibility and @xmath50 is the @xmath9-spin hyperfine coupling constant , for which the values in v@xmath4o@xmath5 , @xmath51 koe/@xmath13 and @xmath52 % @xcite were used .",
    "noted that the host @xmath45 never vanishes in the @xmath53 limit after making a round maximum around 60 k as in v@xmath4o@xmath5 under pressure @xcite .",
    "the origin of the @xmath16 dependence of @xmath45 for the host as well as the guest sites is not clear at present and remains as a future problem .",
    "we have also observed the satellite in the zero - field @xmath1v nmr spectrum in the afi state .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectraafi ] , the satellite appears at lower frequencies of the host resonance .",
    "the intensity of the satellite increases with @xmath7 , suggesting that the satellite signal comes from v nuclei near ti atoms .",
    "the hyperfine fields determined from the peak positions of the spectrum are listed in table[tab : hyper ] .",
    "a periodic modulation of the spin - echo amplitude when varying the rf - pulse separation was observed for both the host and satellite resonances . from the modulation period",
    ", one can determine the splitting of the quadrupolar septet of @xmath1v ( @xmath54=7/2 ) @xcite . for @xmath7 = 0.02 the quadrupolar",
    "splitting of the host resonance is 218(2 ) khz which is slightly larger than that of pure v@xmath4o@xmath5 ( 200 khz ) @xcite .",
    "a smaller splitting of 135(5 ) khz was found for the satellite in the @xmath7 = 0.02 sample .",
    "the appearance of the satellite near the host signal is indicative of the v@xmath8-like electronic state of the guest site in the afi phase as in the pm phase .",
    "this is contrasted with the observation in v@xmath11o@xmath5 where the v@xmath14-like guests are identified via the zero - field @xmath1v nmr @xcite .",
    "we should note here that the relative intensity of the satellite to the host signal is consistent with the probability of finding v nuclei having ti atoms on the four neighboring v sites as in the pm phase .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to consider that the existence of v@xmath8-like guest sites is characteristic of ( v@xmath2ti@xmath3)@xmath4o@xmath5 throughout its magnetic phase diagram .",
    ".hyperfine fields at the v sites in ( v@xmath2ti@xmath3)@xmath4o@xmath5 in the antiferromagnetic insulating state at 4.2 k. [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : hyper ]",
    "the observation of the v@xmath8-like guest sites demonstrates that even in the metallic phase , the electronic state of ( v@xmath2ti@xmath3)@xmath4o@xmath5 is not so homogeneous as has been previoulsy thought .",
    "in addition , the host site preserves the v@xmath4o@xmath5 character in spite of the fact that the number of @xmath9 electrons per vanadium is formally reduced by doping .",
    "these are nothing but a manifestation of strong coulomb repulsion between electrons which favors the number of electrons per site being an integer .",
    "the coulomb interactions as well as nesting of the fermi surface are therefore indispensable for the sdw ordering in metallic v@xmath4o@xmath5 .",
    "it seems , however , that the presence of the magnetic guest sites is crucial in realizing the sdw order , because long - range order ( lro ) is absent in pure v@xmath4o@xmath5 despite the nearly identical spin fluctuations in the metallic phase of pure , v - deficient and ti - doped v@xmath4o@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "a possible scenario is that metallic v@xmath4o@xmath5 is unstable to a perturbation destroying spatial coherence such as defects and impurities owing to the quantum critical nature of spin fluctuations @xcite .",
    "this is reminiscent of impurity - induced lro in low - dimensional quantum antiferromagnets with disordered ground states @xcite . in metallic v@xmath4o@xmath5 ,",
    "v - vacancy induced v@xmath14-like sites and ti - doping induced v@xmath8-like sites may serve as magnetic impurities , transforming the system into the sdw state .",
    "local change due to doping of orbital fluctuations suppressing spin order @xcite is also a likely source for long - range sdw ordering in the doped v@xmath4o@xmath5 systems .    in summary , we established the first - order doping - induced and pressure - induced mit from afi to afm phases in ( v@xmath2ti@xmath3)@xmath4o@xmath5 .",
    "the v@xmath8-like magnetic guest sites exist in the pm phase as well as in the afi phase , indicating the importance of spatially non - uniform electronic states for the sdw ordering .",
