    "it was found recently that photoconductivity can sometimes be greatly enhanced by doping derivatives of poly(phenylene vinylene ) , ppv,@xcite poly(thiophene)@xcite and the @xmath4-conjugated polymer poly(methylphenylsilylene)@xcite with the fullerene molecule c@xmath5 .",
    "this led to construction of photovoltaic cells containing a polymer - fullerene heterojunction.@xcite however these devices had poor efficiency because few of the photogenerated carriers were able to reach the electrodes . recently a great increase in efficiency was obtained by the use of interpenetrating donor ( d ) and acceptor ( a ) networks so that d - a junctions are distributed throughout the device.@xcite in one embodiment d is meh - ppv and a is cn - ppv.@xcite because of the cyano side groups on the ppv chains , the electron affinity of cn - ppv is greater than that of meh - ppv while the ionization potential of meh - ppv is less than that of cn - ppv .",
    "therefore electrons in the excitons photoexcited on meh - ppv chains will tend to move onto cn - ppv chains while holes in the excitons on cn - ppv chains tend to move onto meh - ppv .",
    "recently , rice and gartstein@xcite developed a microscopic theory of the photogeneration process to calculate the rate of photoinduced charge transfer due to exciton dissociation between a polymer chain and an adjacent acceptor molecule .",
    "an essential feature of this theory is that the transfer occurs with energy being conserved , _",
    "i.e. _ , no phonons are involved .",
    "they simplified their theory by neglecting the effects of lattice relaxation , _",
    "i.e. _ , polaron formation .",
    "rice and gartstein suggested that their theory could be generalized to the case of the acceptor being another chain rather than a molecule . in this paper",
    "we carry out such a generalization to study the dissociation of an exciton photoexcited on either the donor or acceptor chain into a free hole in the donor polymer s valence band and an electron in the conduction band of the acceptor polymer .",
    "the theory is applied to an meh - ppv : cn - ppv pair .",
    "we have extended it to investigate the dependence of the dissociation rate on the distance between d and a.",
    "we start our discussion from a model hamiltonian for two coupled conjugated polymer chains of infinite length , @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 describes the intrachain and charge - transfer ( ct ) electron - hole ( e - h ) pair excitations of the two polymer chains considered independent . by the term intrachain",
    "e - h excitations we refer to the excitations of one chain without regard to the presence of the other polymer chain , while by ct e - h excitation we mean the excitation of a charge on one polymer chain in the presence of a charge of opposite sign on the adjacent chain .",
    "such excitations have also been called interchain excitons , indirect excitons and polaron pairs .",
    "@xmath7 includes no coupling between the two chains except for the long - range coulomb interaction between electron and hole .",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 represent the coupling between the two chains , taken to be weak perturbations that cause the interchain charge transfer .",
    "the former describes single - particle hopping and the latter a process in which a charge fluctuation in one species scatters a charge of the other species from one polymer chain to the other.@xcite    it is convenient to assume that each polymer chain has e - h symmetry and measure energies from the center of its gap . because the gap centers of the two polymers need not coincide , we will take our zero of energy at the gap center of the second polymer , that of the first polymer differing from this by the energy @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath7 may then be written @xmath11-\\sum_{mn\\sigma s}u(n - m)b_{n\\sigma}^\\dagger b_{n\\sigma}a_{ms}^\\dagger a_{ms}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\mbox{}+\\sum_{n\\sigma}[{\\bar \\alpha}_0 ( c_{n\\sigma}^\\dagger   c_{n\\sigma}+d_{n\\sigma}^\\dagger d_{n\\sigma})-{\\bar t } ( c_{n+1\\sigma}^\\dagger c_{n\\sigma } + \\mbox{h.c.})\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{0.5cm}\\mbox{}-{\\bar t}(d_{n+1\\sigma}^\\dagger d_{n\\sigma } + \\mbox{h.c.})]-\\sum_{mn\\sigma s}{\\bar u}(n - m ) d_{n\\sigma}^\\dagger d_{n\\sigma}c_{ms}^\\dagger c_{ms}\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{h0 } & & \\mbox{}-\\sum_{mn\\sigma s}v_1(n - m ) d_{n\\sigma}^\\dagger d_{n\\sigma}a_{ms}^\\dagger a_{ms } -\\sum_{mn\\sigma s}v_2(n - m ) b_{n\\sigma}^\\dagger b_{n\\sigma}c_{ms}^\\dagger c_{ms}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) create an electron in the conduction band and a hole in the valence band , respectively , located at the @xmath16th monomer with spin @xmath4 in the first ( second ) chain . @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) denotes the center of each band measured from midgap .",
    "the upper ( lower ) sign before @xmath19 refers to the case where the midgap is above ( below ) the zero of energy . from the first and third terms , one can easily get the single electron and single hole energy spectra : @xmath20 and @xmath21 of the first chain and @xmath22 of the second chain . accordingly in these expressions @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is the band width .",
    "@xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) represents the length of a monomer of the first ( second ) polymer chain . from the excitation spectrum",
    ", one can easily get the energy gaps of e - h excitation , _ ie .",
    "_ , the minimum energy required to create an e - h pair in one polymer chain , @xmath27 of the first chain and @xmath28 of the second chain .",
    "it is then straightforward to see that one should assume @xmath29 and @xmath30 in order to have @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) @xmath33 .",
    "the second and fourth terms in eq .",
    "( [ h0 ] ) represent the intrachain coulomb interaction with @xmath34 for the second chain and the corresponding expression for the first chain with @xmath35 and @xmath36 replaced by @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",

    "( [ h0 ] ) denote the interchain coulomb interactions . for simplicity , we assume @xmath39 equals @xmath40 , with @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 stands for the perpendicular distance between the two chains.@xcite @xmath44 and @xmath45 are dielectric constants along and perpendicular to the polymer chains , respectively .    the hamiltonian @xmath46 represents the perturbation leading to the single - particle interchain hopping process with @xmath47 and @xmath48 being electronic hopping integrals . in general ,",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath48 are not necessarily the same .",
    "it is reasonable to assume they fall off exponentially according to@xcite @xmath49 the charge - fluctuation transfer process is described by @xmath50 where the first term corresponds to an electron being scattered to the other chain by a local fluctuation of the hole density in the vicinity of site @xmath51 , and in the second term the roles of electron and hole are reversed .",
    "we further assume that the matrix element @xmath52 , because , like @xmath39 and @xmath40 , it depends on the coulomb attraction between the electron and hole on separate chains . it is noted that @xmath53 is also related to the electron hopping integrals and would vanish if @xmath47 ( @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , we further assume @xmath55 .",
    "however , we stress here that @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) may also have additional dependence on @xmath58 .",
    "again , @xmath56 is not necessarily equal to @xmath57 .    in the following discussion of charge transfer",
    ", we always assume that the exciton is photogenerated on the second chain",
    ". the exciton can dissociate either with transfer of an electron or a hole to the first chain as shown schematically in fig .",
    "it can also be deduced from fig .  1 that only for the midgap of the first chain above that of the second chain is it possible to have hole transfer ( ht ) without electron transfer , while only for the midgap of the first chain below that of the second chain is it possible to have electron transfer ( et ) without hole transfer . additionally , for both ht and et ,",
    "in order that the other carrier not hop to the other chain as well , it is necessary to satisfy the additional condition @xmath59 .",
    "we first discuss in detail the case of hole transfer . with",
    "the intrachain and interchain coulomb interaction included , the intrachain e - h excitation spectrum of the second polymer chain consists of an intrachain exciton with energy @xmath60 and a continuum band of width @xmath61 above the energy gap @xmath62 .",
    "the ht e - h excitation spectrum consists of an interchain ( ht ) exciton with energy @xmath63 and a continuum band of width @xmath64 above the gap @xmath65 .",
    "( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "energy conservation requires that ct due to an intrachain exciton in the second chain giving up a hole to the first chain ( ht ) can only take place when @xmath66    the decay rate of the exciton can be written from the fermi golden rule : @xmath67 in this equation , @xmath68 ( @xmath69 , 2 ) is the matrix element describing the transition from the initial intrachain exciton state @xmath70 to the final ct e - h excitation states .",
    "the intrachain spectrum can be acquired as follows .",
    "we first construct a two - particle wave function of a singlet e - h pair excitation on the second polymer chain as @xmath71 with @xmath72 denoting the ground state .",
    "@xmath73 is assumed to be real and is normalized according to @xmath74 .",
    "from @xmath75 , we obtain for the lowest excitonic bound state with energy @xmath60,@xcite @xmath76 similarly we can construct a two - particle ht wavefunction as @xmath77 @xmath78 is given by the equation @xmath79\\phi_{n - m}= -(t+\\bar t)(\\phi_{n - m+1}+\\phi_{n - m-1})-v(n - m)\\phi_{n - m}\\;,\\ ] ] with the normalization condition @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the number of monomers on the chain .",
    "( here we have assumed @xmath82 to be real ) .",
    "it is noted that in the above we only retain the solutions with zero cm wave vector , indicated by a superscript @xmath83 on @xmath84 and @xmath85 , as is required for momentum conservation .",
    "because we assume that free carriers are generated by the dissociation , we only need to get the scattering states of these equations in order to calculate @xmath86 .",
    "the decay rate of an exciton in the second chain by transferring a hole to the first chain may now be written as @xmath87 with @xmath69 standing for the process of single - particle hopping and @xmath88 for the charge fluctuation process .",
    "we take @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the dimensionless rate @xmath91 , which differs from that defined by rice and gartstein , is defined by @xmath92 where @xmath93",
    "we apply our theory to an meh - ppv : cn - ppv pair .",
    "we consider first an exciton photoinduced on the cn - ppv chain .",
    "this exciton is dissociated by transferring a hole to meh - ppv . to this end",
    ", we take the second chain as cn - ppv and the first one as meh - ppv .",
    "the values of the various unknown parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) ( written with unbarred quantities for the first chain ) must be chosen to give the correct gap and exciton binding energy . for meh - ppv",
    "the optical absorption edge is at 2.1  ev.@xcite the single particle energy gap of meh - ppv has been measured as 2.45  ev.@xcite the exciton binding energy is the difference of these two numbers,@xcite thus 0.35  ev .",
    "the intrachain coulomb potential coefficient @xmath38 or @xmath36 is of the order of the coulomb attraction between an electron and a hole separated by one monomer ( @xmath94   ) , which is @xmath95  ev.@xcite @xmath96  ev . choosing @xmath97  ev , @xmath98  ev,@xcite and @xmath99  ev , we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) @xmath100  ev , the exciton creation energy @xmath101  ev and its binding energy @xmath102  ev . for cn - ppv the optical absorption edge is at @xmath103  ev.@xcite it is reasonable to assume that the exciton binding energy is similar to that of ppv and meh - ppv . with @xmath104",
    "ev , @xmath105  ev , and @xmath106  ev , we obtain @xmath107  ev , the exciton creation energy @xmath108  ev and @xmath109  ev .    to obtain numerical results for ht we further take @xmath110,@xcite @xmath111 , @xmath112  ev , the energy difference between gap centers of meh - ppv and cn - ppv @xmath113  ev,@xcite and @xmath114  @xmath115.@xcite for the numerical calculations , we employ a chain of @xmath116 unit cells for each of the polymers and use periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we then numerically solve eq .",
    "( [ eqb ] ) for the ct band eigenfunctions @xmath117 and their eigenvalues @xmath118 and substitute them and the numerical solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) to get @xmath91 . in evaluating @xmath91 ,",
    "we replace the @xmath119-function in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) by a gaussian with variance @xmath120  ev .",
    "the resulting @xmath91 ( @xmath69 , 2 ) are plotted as solid curves as a function of @xmath58 .",
    "since @xmath58 is proportional to the square of the distance between the chains , the transfer rate falls off very rapidly with increasing @xmath58 .",
    "we estimate the minimum chain separation as @xmath121   , giving the minimum @xmath122 .",
    "an increase in interchain distance by a factor 2 is seen to decrease the transfer rate @xmath123 by almost 4 orders of magnitude , and @xmath124 even more .",
    "rewriting the first inequality in eq .",
    "( [ ht ] ) we obtain the threshold value of @xmath19 , @xmath125 for ht in this case eq .",
    "( [ cc ] ) gives @xmath126  ev .",
    "it is noteworthy that @xmath123 and @xmath124 peak at the threshold value of @xmath19 .",
    "this was also found to be the case for the calculation of charge transfer to a dopant molecule.@xcite the appearance in fig .",
    "2 of finite @xmath127 values below the threshold is due to the replacement of the @xmath119-function in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) by a gaussian .",
    "it is possible to change @xmath19 by changing one or both of the polymers or by application of an electric field perpendicular to the chains . for an electric field of @xmath128",
    "v / cm , for example , if the meh - ppv and cn - ppv chains were separated by 4   ,  the change in @xmath19 due to the field would be @xmath129  ev . thus @xmath19 for ht in meh - ppv : cn - ppv would be either 0.3 or 0.7  ev depending on the direction of the electric field . as can be seen in figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) , for @xmath123 this could be a change by a factor 2 .",
    "for @xmath124 the change is smaller because @xmath124 decreases less rapidly with increase in @xmath19 .",
    "thus the dissociation rate may be substantially increased or decreased by high electric fields .",
    "having @xmath123 , we can get an approximate value , or at least an upper limit , for @xmath130 using the average of @xmath131 values for meh - ppv and cn - ppv , the individual values having been determined from the energy shift between exciton and excimer emission.@xcite that average is @xmath132  ev . for a spacing of 6    between meh - ppv and cn - ppv @xmath133 , leading to @xmath134 for @xmath113  ev and @xmath135  ps . for 4   , @xmath136 leading to @xmath137  fs for @xmath113  ev .",
    "thus the dissociation process we are calculating is quite rapid .",
    "consider now the case of an exciton photoinduced in meh - ppv dissociating into an e - h pair by transferring an electron to cn - ppv .",
    "for this calculation we take the second chain to be meh - ppv , thus interchanging @xmath32 , @xmath18 , @xmath138 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 with @xmath31 , @xmath17 , @xmath139 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively .",
    "equations ( [ ht ] ) and ( [ eqb ] ) derived for the ht case are unchanged . numerical solution of the equations , as described earlier , leads to @xmath91 for et shown as the dashed curves in fig .  2 and 3 . the threshold value of @xmath19 for et determined from eq .",
    "( [ cc ] ) is 0.4  ev rather than 0.2  ev because of the interchange of @xmath31 and @xmath32 ; the exciton is generated on the chain with the smaller gap in this case .",
    "apart from the difference in threshold , @xmath91 for et varies with @xmath19 and @xmath58 in similar fashion to the case for ht .",
    "the decay rate @xmath140 is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ decay ] ) with @xmath141 , @xmath142 . since @xmath143 and @xmath123 is about twice as large for et when @xmath113  ev , the dissociation rate @xmath144 is about twice as large for et as for ht and the @xmath130 values 1/2 as large .    in summary",
    "we have calculated the dissociation rate of an exciton on a donor or acceptor chain into a free electron on a and a free hole on d by a process that conserves energy , _",
    "i.e. _ , no phonons are involved .",
    "also , the process is applicable to chains that are sufficiently long that broadening of their molecular orbital levels is at least as large as the spacing of the unperturbed discrete levels.@xcite for dissociation to be possible in the absence of an electric field whichever chain the exciton is generated on , the midgap of d must lie above that of a by at least the exciton binding energy plus @xmath145 the absolute value of the difference in the energy gaps . for the difference in midgaps greater than this amount the rate of dissociation decreases rapidly . the difference in midgap energy levels of the pair cn - ppv :",
    "meh - ppv is close to satisfying the condition for maximum transfer rate .",
    "the transfer rate falls off so rapidly as the distance between d and a increases that essentially transfer can take place only between neighbors separated by perhaps 4 to 6    perpendicular to the chain direction . for a cn - ppv : meh - ppv pair separated by 4    we calculate a hole transfer time @xmath3  fs , the electron transfer time being shorter by a factor 2 . as a consequence ,",
    "since it has been demonstrated that there is phase separation of the two polymers on a scale of 10 - 100  nm,@xcite and the exciton hopping time in ppv has been estimated as 0.4  ps,@xcite the dissociation rate will likely be determined by the time it takes the exciton to diffuse to a location where the required donor or acceptor is within @xmath121   .",
