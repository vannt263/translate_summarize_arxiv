    "the lyman-@xmath0 forest is a tracer of the diffuse matter between galaxies known as the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , and at high redshift ( @xmath9 ) this diffuse medium contains roughly 70% of the baryonic mass and occupies 90% or more of the volume .",
    "galaxies form from the collapse of dark matter structures and corresponding accretion of gas from the igm .",
    "but this is not a one - way process , and feedback is vital for a complete picture .",
    "galactic outflows modify the kinetic and thermal energy of the medium and distribute the by - product of star formation : metals ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "metals have been observed in the high redshift ly@xmath0  forest . in particular",
    "( e.g. @xcite ) and  ( e.g. @xcite ) provide prominent absorbers and are commonly measured .",
    "other species seen are , ,  and   ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these measurements provide some indications of the regions of the universe touched by mechanical feedback , but they can also provide a useful probe of the ionization properties of the medium ( and so the physical conditions of the gas ) , and the abundance pattern . the main obstacle to significant progress on the latter two goals is a lack of large numbers of metal species to measure both from the same element ( to measure ionization characteristics ) and from different elements ( to measure abundance patterns ) .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a new technique for the detection of weak metal lines  the composite spectrum of ly@xmath0  forest absorbers .",
    "we apply this approach to the largest ly@xmath0  forest dataset available : the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) sample of qso spectra .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the sdss sample can provide precision measurements of weak lines by searching for  absorption associated with the bulk of the ly@xmath0  forest .",
    "here we produce a blind search for absorption correlated with the strong ly@xmath0  forest absorbers ; we identify and fit 19 metal lines .",
    "we use the sloan digital sky survey data release 5 ( sdss dr5 ) @xcite , which provides 13,279 qsos with useful forest coverage in the redshift range @xmath10 .",
    "the spectra are taken from the qso absorption line sample ( qsoals ; @xcite ) in the same manner described in @xcite employed for dr3 spectra .",
    "the spectral resolution is wavelength dependent and varies from @xmath11 . in the following work",
    "we assume that @xmath12 at all wavelengths , and the error introduced by this approximation is smaller than the quoted errors .",
    "we define `` absorbers '' in a simple way , selecting pixels that are lower in flux than their two neighboring pixels and have optical depth @xmath13 .",
    "we require that our ly@xmath0  absorbers are redward of the ly@xmath14  forest and blueward of @xmath15 from the quasar ly@xmath0  emission redshift . in the stacked spectrum discussed in this paper we use only ly@xmath0  absorbers in the redshift range @xmath10 , resulting in some variation in the average redshift across the stacked spectrum ( see figure  [ stack ] ) .",
    "we ensure that the selected absorbers are not saturated at sdss resolution by requiring a minimum flux of @xmath16 .",
    "this requirement , which eliminates damped ly@xmath0  systems and noisy lines , discards 86% of ly@xmath0  absorbers in the required optical depth range .",
    "at sdss spectral resolution , solitary ly@xmath0  forest lines with @xmath17parameters @xmath18 and no damping wings do not reach an apparent optical depth greater than @xmath19 , even if they are fully saturated .",
    "the absorption features in our sample are therefore blends of several ly@xmath0  forest lines rather than individual strong lines ; we address the typical column densities of these features in  [ interpret ] below , using the stacked spectra themselves .",
    "for each ly@xmath0  absorber in our sample , we de - redshift the whole spectrum to its rest - frame .",
    "each quasar spectrum is carried forward once for every ly@xmath0  absorber , so some sdss spectra are used more than once while others are not used at all .",
    "what results is a stack of spectra on a rest - frame wavelength grid .",
    "we employ two statistics to produce composite spectra : the median , and the arithmetic mean with a 3% outlier clipping . we require a minimum of 100 pixels for the measurement of the stacked spectrum at any point . when computing the composite spectrum redward of 1236 , we only include pixels if they are outside of the ly@xmath0  forest of the quasar spectrum in question , since the pixels outside of the forest have much less background absorption and associated random fluctuations .",
    "we estimate the error in the flux for the stacked spectrum by bootstrapping the data using 100 realizations .",
    "this is mostly consistent with the estimate from the propagation of errors , but it is larger in the wavelength range between the ly@xmath14  and ly@xmath0  lines , due to scatter in uncorrelated ly@xmath0  forest absorption .",
    "figure [ stack ] shows the stacked spectrum we obtain using the median ( which is our fiducial choice ) .",
    "the stacked spectrum never reaches 100% transmission ( @xmath20 ) because there is always some uncorrelated , contaminating absorption .",
    "the full - width - half - maximum of sdss resolution is @xmath21 , which corresponds to an effective doppler parameter of @xmath22 .",
    "this is around four times as broad as typical lyman - series lines and broader still for metal lines .",
    "hence the majority of contaminating `` background '' absorption in our spectra is not a true superposition of overlapping lines but a blending of distinct lines that appear superimposed due to sdss resolution .    given that uncorrelated contaminating absorption varies smoothly in our stacked spectrum , we can treat it as a continuum by performing a standard spline fit , producing the ` pseudo - continuum ' shown by the overlay in figure [ stack ] .",
    "we have scaled away its effect by adding the flux decrement of the pseudo - continuum to our stacked spectrum , thus arriving at what is effectively a composite rest - frame spectrum of the selected ly@xmath0  absorbers .",
    "figure [ compspec ] shows the median spectral stack of our sample of ly@xmath0  forest absorbers renormalized using the pseudo - continuum .",
    "a great many absorption lines are seen in this composite rest - frame spectrum .",
    "the lyman series is particularly clear and is marked by dotted lines .",
    "numerous metal lines are also seen at high confidence and are marked with dashed lines and labelled .",
    "the ly@xmath0  line shows large wings , which are to be expected as a signal of large scale structure .",
    "the scale of the correlation extends to @xmath23 , which is in good agreement with the findings of @xcite .",
    "there is no indication that the signal arises from damping wings , and higher order lyman lines rule out this interpretation ( see following section ) .",
    "these wings have not been carefully fitted to separate the signal of clustering from the mean flux decrement in the forest , as the measurements in this paper are not dependent on this fit .",
    "it should be noted that the weak lines seen redward of some lines ( e.g. , , and  doublets ) are a signal due to  interlopers .",
    "there is a small sample of strong  absorbers that has entered our sample of ly@xmath0  lines for stacking .",
    "when these lines are misinterpreted as ly@xmath0 , a `` shadow '' signal in our stacked spectra is seen shifted by @xmath24 .",
    "this shadowing is apparent for every identified metal line in the arithmetic mean stack , in keeping with its status as a less outlier - resistant statistic .",
    "we disregard these `` shadow '' lines in our analysis below .",
    "it is surprising that no substantial shadow is seen for ly@xmath0 ; we do not have a simple explanation for this effect , and it appears that these  absorbers are an interesting sample in their own right .",
    "full interpretation of these stacked spectra will require the use of model spectra and/or degraded high - resolution spectra to account for the effects of line blending , sample selection , and pseudo - continuum subtraction . in this paper , we restrict our interpretation to some general conclusions that can be drawn by comparing the measured line strengths to simple models .",
    "figure [ cog ] shows a measurement of the  column density using the lyman series .",
    "for each of seven lyman series lines ( n=1:ly@xmath0 , n=2:ly@xmath14 , n=3:ly@xmath25  etc . ) , we measure a rest - frame equivalent width @xmath26 .",
    "we plot them normalized by the product @xmath27 of oscillator strength and line wavelength .",
    "optically thin lyman series lines would all have equal values of @xmath28 .",
    "the equivalent width is shown for both the median and the arithmetic mean , with error bars drawn from bootstrapping in the composite spectra .",
    "the noise in the arithmetic mean spectrum renders the pseudo - continuum fitting blueward of 935  unreliable , so we only show lyman lines n=1,2,3,4 and 5 .",
    "the curves in figure [ cog ] are created by using vpfitrfc / vpfit.html ] to generate model lines at sdss resolution , from which we measure a simulated @xmath26 .",
    "the flatness of the @xmath29 points in the median stack suggests that these lines are optically thin , and comparison to the model curves then implies a total column density @xmath30 for our median absorption features . in this column density range ,",
    "lines with velocity width @xmath31 go from significantly saturated at @xmath32 to minimally saturated at @xmath33 , in agreement with the trend in the data points .",
    "lines with @xmath34 , corresponding to the narrowest doppler parameters seen for individual ly@xmath0  forest absorbers , predict rising values of @xmath28 from @xmath29 , in clear disagreement with the observed trend .",
    "lines much broader than @xmath31 would predict too much ly@xmath14 and ly@xmath25 absorption relative to the higher order lines .    of course , these absorption features are probably not well described by single voigt line profiles , in part because the composite spectrum comes from systems with a range of properties , but mostly because the contributing features are themselves blends of multiple lines .",
    "the models in figure  [ cog ] all under - predict the ly@xmath0  equivalent width , plausibly because the `` main '' absorption feature is near - saturated in ly@xmath0  and absorption outside the gaussian wings ( but still within the sdss resolution element ) makes a larger relative contribution .",
    "while the @xmath35 parameters implied by figure  [ cog ] have a complex and non - trivial significance , the high - order lyman series lines do appear to give a robust estimate of the total column density characteristic of our median stack , with @xmath30 .",
    "results for the arithmetic mean stack suggest a column density lower by 0.1 - 0.2 dex , but it is harder to draw clear conclusions because we can not robustly measure lyman-6 and lyman-7 in the arithmetic mean stack .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "we have developed a technique for measuring the _ composite spectrum of ly@xmath0  forest absorbers _ and applied it to 13,279 quasar spectra from the sdss . from our stacked spectra",
    ", we measure equivalent widths of lyman series lines up to @xmath36 and column densities of 19 metal lines .",
    "we find metal lines from species previously detected in the ly@xmath0  forest ( , , , ,  and ) , from new ionization states of oxygen ( ) , silicon ( ) , and carbon ( ) , and from new elements magnesium ( ) , aluminum ( ) and iron ( ) not previously identified in high - redshift ly@xmath0  forest studies .",
    "consistent results from the median and arithmetic mean stacked spectra and from multiple lines of the same ionic species show that the measured column densities are robust .",
    "high @xmath35-parameters of the fitted metal lines provide a suggestive signal of large - scale clustering or high velocity dispersions in the environment of the absorbers .",
    "analysis of the lyman series implies typical column densities @xmath5 for systems in our median stack .",
    "the high - ionization metal - line species can then be explained assuming typical physical conditions for the diffuse igm and metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath37 , but reproducing the low - ionization species requires much higher metallicities and higher densities , probably arising in a minority sub - population of the absorption systems .",
    "the composite spectrum technique introduced here has the potential to teach us a great deal about physical conditions and enrichment of the igm and the spectral shape of the ionizing background radiation .",
    "a natural next step is to compare composite spectra in narrower bins of redshift and ly@xmath0  optical depth , and to apply the technique to the weaker but more abundant ly@xmath0  forest absorbers that dominate the mean opacity . in this regard",
    ", we note that the high - redshift quasar sample from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey of sdss - iii @xcite will eventually exceed the size of the current sdss sample by an order of magnitude .",
    "this technique may also be usefully applied to high - resolution spectra and to _ hubble space telescope _",
    "spectra of the low - redshift ly@xmath0  forest , using the power of large numbers to bring out features that are too weak to appear in even the best single - quasar spectra .",
