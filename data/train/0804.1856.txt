    "emission - line equivalent width predicted for stellar populations with burst - like star formation histories .",
    "the thick solid lines correspond to @xmath36 populations with exponentially decaying star formation rates of @xmath95 ( i.e. instantaneous burst ) , @xmath96 and @xmath74 yr ( from bottom to top at an age of @xmath73 yr ) .",
    "the two thin dashed ( dash - dotted ) lines represent the corresponding equivalent width predictions for @xmath95 and @xmath97 yr when instead @xmath37 ( @xmath38).,width=317 ]    this investigation provides support for the origin of long duration grbs in very massive stars .",
    "in @xcite we found a similar conclusion for sn1998bw ( grb980425 ) .",
    "the parent population of core collapse supernovae is expected to be biased towards ages corresponding to the lifetime of stars with mass close to the lower limit for sne ( @xmath98 ) , since for a normal imf these are more common than very massive stars .",
    "already the finding that two of the still few known sne coincident with long duration grbs seem to have higher masses suggests that the parent populations may be different .",
    "this is consistent with studies of the spatial distribution of grbs and sne within galaxies @xcite",
    ". it also agrees with the modeling of the sne associated with grbs , which typically indicate very massive progenitors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* table 1 ) . admittedly more examples would be needed since for individual cases there is always a risk that photometry is affected by limited spatial resolution and chance projections such that the progenitor had a different age than its surroundings . by imaging the most nearby grb host galaxies with hst - like resolution , population studies of the explosion environment can provide statistical constraints on grb progenitor masses .",
    "the method could also be used for supernovae that are too distant for single stars in their host galaxies to be resolved ( @xmath99 mpc ) and has been used for constraining the progenitors of the type iip sn 2004dj @xcite and the type ic sn 2007gr @xcite",
    "we have used archival hst images to derive photometry for the explosion site of grb030329 . this has been used together with spectral evolutionary synthesis models , including nebular emission and a wide variety of parameter settings , to constrain the age of the stellar population . taking this age to equal the lifetime of the grb progenitor star",
    ", we can use the tight relationship between initial mass and lifetime to weigh the progenitor .    studying the photometry at the resolution allowed by hst",
    ", the explosion site has an inferred age of @xmath84 myr for an instantaneous burst assumption .",
    "the 3@xmath57 upper limit of 8 myr corresponds to a minimum progenitor mass of 25 m@xmath26 , in line with the predictions of the collapsar model for the origin of long duration grbs @xcite .",
    "the main limitation is related to spatial resolution ( for @xmath0 one hst / acs / wfc pixel corresponds to 140 pc ) and arises because we can not be sure that the grb parent population can be described by a single stellar population .",
    "thus , nearby clusters of different age may contaminate the photometry , thereby mimicking an extended star formation history . allowing for a more extended star formation history",
    ", most models still predict a minimum progenitor mass of around 25 m@xmath26 , but for a small number of models the minimum allowed ( within 3@xmath57 ) progenitor mass is @xmath100m@xmath26 .",
    "we discuss ways to obtain tighter age constraints and identify the equivalenth width of h@xmath89 and near - ir photometry as useful additional diagnostics .",
    "if exercised on a sufficient number of long duration grbs , the method in this paper could provide information on the progenitor mass and metallicity distributions .",
    "this would provide an independent comparison to estimates obtained through modeling of the associated supernova .",
