    "since the discovery of the integer quantized hall effect ( iqhe )  @xcite in a two dimensional electron system ( 2des ) , its topological properties are investigated intensively  @xcite .",
    "the guiding gauge invariance argument of laughlin is fundamental to the phenomena , which focusses on a cylinder considering a strong , time - dependent magnetic field @xmath0 threaded to its surface in the normal direction  @xcite .",
    "each time the field is increased by one magnetic flux quantum ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 the elementary charge and @xmath3 being the planck constant ) , an electron is argued to be transferred adiabatically from one side of the cylinder to the other side , protecting the geometrical phase . the result is a flow of electrical current proportional to the electromotive driving force , with a precisely quantized proportionality coefficient- the hall conductance .",
    "the topological aspects of the iqhe assuming periodic boundary conditions was first discussed by thouless _",
    "et al _ , where hall conductance is re - introduced as the topological invariant of the 2 + 1 d system  @xcite . in these highly appreciated works ,",
    "the topological character of the 2des is described in terms of the incompressible bulk state and an expression is obtained via kubo formalism for the hall conductance , which is in turn determined by the chern number  @xcite .",
    "the topological arguments rely on the fact that the hall conductivity is an integer multiple of @xmath4 , if the fermi energy @xmath5 is in between two landau levels .",
    "in this situation the 2des is incompressible in the bulk , namely there are no available states at @xmath5 . within the non - interacting picture ,",
    "charge transport along the edges is described by dissipationless 1d edge channels  @xcite , which completes the analogy between the topological insulators and iqhe .",
    "it is very important to emphasize that all the above descriptions of the iqhe are in the _ momentum _ space , @xmath6 . to be explicit , one assumes periodicity in @xmath7space , perform calculations related with geometrical phase in this space and then due to the symmetry arguments maps momentum space directly to real space . for sure ,",
    "such a mapping can be justified only if the electronic system is periodic both in momentum and in real space .",
    "for instance if one performs calculations on a closed cylinder , with a radial @xmath0 field .",
    "however , when considering a real size sample with finite length and perpendicular field the symmetry argument is prone to fail .",
    "in addition , disorder emanating from remote donors provide localized states which result in finite width quantized hall plateaus in certain @xmath0 field intervals .",
    "hence , the incompressibility of the bulk throughout this interval is preserved and is essential to observe iqhe .",
    "namely , without disorder the plateaus would shrink to a single @xmath0 value for an unbounded 2des , where the landau level filling fraction @xmath8 is an integer , which is defined by @xmath9  @xcite . here , @xmath10 is the number of electrons in a certain area @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the number of flux quanta in @xmath11 .",
    "the incontestable concept of insulator bulk state has been challenged by the inclusion of interactions starting from early 1990 s advocated by chang  @xcite .",
    "later , chklovskii and co - workers analytically showed that the direct coulomb interaction results in a metal - like ( compressible ) bulk , whereas the insulating states can also be at the edges suppressing back ( or forward ) scattering within the plateau interval  @xcite . in the last decade , the bulk and edge electrostatic properties of the 2des is investigated with the improvement of local probe techniques  @xcite .",
    "measurements show that the spatial distribution of the theoretically predicted edge incompressible strips and the experimentally observed poor screening regions coincide nearly perfect .",
    "however , with a crucial qualitative difference : the edge strips become transparent to hall field whenever the widths of these incompressible strips become comparable with quantum mechanical or thermodynamical length scales .",
    "this discrepancy is removed when the electrostatic problem is solved also taking into account quantum mechanical quantities , like the finite widths of the wave function , together with the effects of finite temperature and level broadening  @xcite .     filling factor distribution in the hall bar for characteristic @xmath13 values , where @xmath14 is the fermi energy in the bulk calculated for a typical electron density of @xmath15 @xmath16 .",

    "we find that , the inner contacts leave the qhe unaffected although the topology of the system is remarkably changed from genus 0 to 2 .",

    "it is observed that , the edge and bulk incompressible regions merge due to potential fluctuations resembling the topological bulk theory of the iqhe .",

    "[ fig : hall_bar ] , we show the electron density distribution ( or equivalently local filling factors , @xmath59 ) as a function of spatial coordinates , where the color gradient depicts compressible and black regions correspond to incompressible regions with constant electron density .",
    "the electron density effectively vanishes beneath the inner contacts and at the edges ( white areas ) , which is bordered by broken ( red ) lines . along the incompressible regions",
    "the electrostatic potential varies due to poor screening and is approximately flat when the region is compressible , i.e. @xmath60 varies . since",
    ", the formation of incompressible regions is shown to be sensitive to temperature and the strength of the magnetic field , we will consider situations where the electron temperature is sufficiently low so that the incompressible regions are well developed .",
    "namely , if @xmath61 the incompressible region is smeared out  @xcite . here , we present results only considering the quantized hall plateau interval . in fig .",
    "[ fig : hall_bar]a , we show a situation where two incompressible strips reside along the edges and two encircling the inner contacts .",
    "the inset depicts cuts along the @xmath62 direction , where one sees that encircling ones are narrower than that of the _ edge _ incompressible strips .",
    "later we will argue that , once the incompressible regions become narrower than thermodynamical length scales they become evanescent and unable to decouple inner contacts . by decoupling , we mean that electron transport between two compressible regions is hindered by the incompressible region .",
    "namely , scattering or tunneling is not possible across the stirp . at a higher @xmath0 field",
    ", we again observe that the 2des comprises two edge incompressible strips parallel to the @xmath63- axis together with circular strips surrounding inner contacts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hall_bar]b ) , however the strips become wider .",
    "in this situation the bulk is compressible , in contrast , the inner contacts are decoupled from each other by the encircling strips , known as the corbino effect  @xcite . at @xmath19 ,",
    "the incompressible strips merge and the sample becomes approximately incompressible , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : hall_bar]c . increasing @xmath0 furthermore results in an electron distribution where the incompressible regions are disconnected around the contacts , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hall_bar]d , however , are percolating along the edges .",
    "in this situation a dissipative transport between inner contacts is possible , which will be described by ohm s law .",
    "the above situation is altered if one considers disorder . to analyze the disorder effects on the electron distribution ,",
    "we embodied charged impurities to donor layer resulting in potential fluctuations .",
    "following a recent investigation  @xcite , we considered sufficiently high number of impurities ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "note that , disorder is always included to our calculations that determines landau level broadening and conductivities .",
    "inclusion of the disorder , apparently enlarges the edge incompressible strips as shown in fig .",
    "[ hallbar_disorder]a . at a higher @xmath0",
    "the two edge strips merge with the encircling strips as shown in fig .",
    "[ hallbar_disorder]b . by the inclusion of disorder",
    ", we observe that the bulk becomes incompressible for larger @xmath0 intervals , hence wider quantized hall plateaus are expected in accordance with typical experiments  @xcite . a characteristic filling factor distribution",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ hallbar_disorder]c .",
    "even grippingly , at a slightly higher @xmath0 field the bulk incompressible region starts to become disconnected around the inner contacts , allowing dissipative current paths between them .",
    "as mentioned , incompressible bulk is a key concept in developing the analogy between topological insulators and conductance quantization .",
    "however , we have shown that it is possible to have a compressible metal - like bulk within the plateau interval due to interactions .",
    "next , we investigate the transport between the inner contacts by calculating the impedance when a finite potential difference is applied between the inner contacts .",
    "in our model we assume that the transport can be well described by a local version of the ohm s law  @xcite and the impedance is composed of resistive @xmath65 and capacitive @xmath66 terms as , @xmath67 . here , @xmath68 is a constant depending on the frequency of the imposed excitation , which we take to be of the order of unity .",
    "the calculation of the ( quantum ) capacitance is somewhat trivial , since it is only proportional to the thermodynamic density of states at @xmath5 , namely @xmath69 .",
    "if there exists an incompressible region ( i.e. @xmath70 ) , which decouples inner contacts then the impedance reads to infinity for a pure hall bar at @xmath46 .",
    "however , for a realistic hall bar with disorder , i.e. with localized states at @xmath5 , and at finite temperatures capacitance also becomes finite . to decide whether if the inner contacts are decoupled or not by the encircling incompressible strips , our first task is to determine the widths of the incompressible regions depending on @xmath0 , which we calculate self - consistently and show in fig .  [",
    "fig : capacitance]a .",
    "once the strip widths are wider than the thermodynamical length scale , i.e. fermi wavelength @xmath71 , one can assume that the inner contacts are decoupled .",
    "hence , impedance is dominated by the capacitive term",
    "[ fig : capacitance]b depicts @xmath72 , obtained from gaussian broadened landau levels at different temperatures .",
    "the corresponding impedance is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : capacitance]c , where we observe that @xmath73 is constant ( @xmath74 ) if incompressible regions decouple inner contacts .",
    "otherwise , it is determined by the resistive term which we assume again a gaussian level broadening to calculate @xmath75 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : capacitance]b . by increasing the temperature",
    "the incompressible strips become narrower , hence , the constant @xmath73 interval shrinks while its amplitude decreases due to larger available states at @xmath5 .",
    "we also depicted the disordered situation by thin lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : capacitance]c where the bulk incompressible region is extended in @xmath0 as shown previously .",
    "the result is wider constant @xmath73 intervals , which decrease in amplitude and shrink in width similar to the pure hall bar case by increasing the temperature .",
    "( a ) calculated widths of incompressible strips at different temperatures and ( b ) corresponding thermodynamical density of states in units of @xmath76 mev@xmath77@xmath16 .",
    "( c ) resulting impedance between inner contacts without ( thick lines ) and with potential fluctuations ( thin lines ) . ]",
    "our numerical calculations show that the bulk of the electronic system is not insulating for all magnetic field strengths throughout the plateau interval and iqhe is insensitive to topological distortion in real space .",
    "this finding is in well agreement with existing local probe experiments , however , is in contrast with the single particle theories of the iqhe .",
    "the discrepancy is removed by the consideration of the disorder effects . in this work we quantitatively demonstrated that the edge and bulk pictures of the iqhe merge , which are both the limiting cases of the screening theory .    in light of our calculations",
    "we propose to measure hall resistance of a 2des that embodies two inner contacts in the bulk and simultaneously measure the potential difference between them .",
    "a constant high impedance @xmath0 subinterval is predicted within the plateau regime , in contrast to single particle theories for which one expects the constant @xmath73 interval to be spread all over the plateau regime .",
    "we claim that the varying impedance evidences a compressible bulk .",
    "it is also expected that the amplitude of the constant @xmath73 will decrease with increasing temperature .",
    "different from the early experiments  @xcite we suggest to consider a relatively narrow hall bar ( @xmath78 @xmath44 m ) to be defined on a high mobility ( @xmath79 @xmath80/vs ) wafer .",
