    "it is assumed that in the collision a fireball is produced .",
    "constituents of the fireball collide frequently to establish local thermal equilibrium sufficiently fast and after a certain time @xmath7 , hydrodynamics become applicable . if the macroscopic properties of the fluid e.g. energy density , pressure , velocity etc . are known at the equilibration time @xmath7 , the relativistic hydrodynamic equations can be solved to give the space - time evolution of the fireball till a given freeze - out condition such that interactions between the constituents are too weak to continue the evolution . using suitable algorithm ( e.g. cooper - frye ) information at the freeze - out can be converted into particle spectra and can be directly compared with experimental data .",

    "shear viscosity of qgp matter is quite uncertain . in recent years",
    ", string theory motivated calculations @xcite indicated that shear viscosity over entropy ratio of any matter is bounded from the lower side , @xmath12 .",

    "it is expected .",
    "multiplicity increases logarithmically with energy .",
    "centrality dependence of mean @xmath2 is another important observable . in au+au collisions at rhic , in minimally viscous hydrodyanmics , centrality dependence of @xmath47 of identified particles",
    "are reasonably well expalined . in fig.[f3 ] minimally hydrodynamics predictions for mean @xmath2 for @xmath44 , @xmath45 and protons , in pb+pb colliisons at lhc are shown . in collisions beyond @xmath4=50 ,",

    "for example , in a central collision with @xmath4=350 , for all the species , mean @xmath2 is increased by @xmath5 10% from rhic to lhc energy .",
    "minimally viscous hydrodynamic model predictions for @xmath44 @xmath2-spectra , in 0 - 10% , 10 - 20% , 20 - 30% , 30 - 40% , 40 - 50% and 50 - 60% centrality pb+pb collisions at lhc are shown in fig.[f4 ] .",
    "we have neglected resonance production .",
    "resonance decay contribute to particle yield , more at low @xmath2 than at large @xmath2 .",
    "for example , at freeze - out temperature @xmath36=150 mev , nearly @xmath5 50% of total pions are from resonance decay at @xmath49=0.5 gev , contribution of decay pions decreases to @xmath520% at higher @xmath49=2 gev @xcite .",

    "however , we must mention that overall normalisation do not account correctly for the resonance contribution to particle @xmath2-spectra .",
    "@xmath2 spectra will be uncertain by 10 - 15% . for comparison , in fig.[f4 ] , predicted spectra in au+au collisions at rhic are shown as the dashed lines .",

    "it is unlikely that viscous dynamics will predict correctly particle production at high @xmath50 3gev .",
    "present predictions are expected to be in reasonable agreement with future experiments up to @xmath51 3 gev .",
    "one of the important observations in au+au collisions at rhic is the significant elliptic flow in non - central collisions .",
    "qualitatively , elliptic flow is explained in a hydrodynamic model , re - scattering of secondaries generates pressure and drives the subsequent collective motion . in non - central collisions ,",
    "the reaction zone is asymmetric ( almond shaped ) , pressure gradient is large in one direction and small in the other .",
    "the asymmetric pressure gradients generate the elliptic flow . as the fluid evolve and expands , asymmetry in the reaction zone decreases and comes a stage when the reaction zone become symmetric and system no longer generate elliptic flow .",
    "elliptic flow is an early time phenomena and a sensitive probe to the early stage of the fluid .    in fig.[f7 ]",
    ", solid line is the predicted elliptic flow in minimum bias pb+pb collisions at lhc . for comparison",
    ", we have shown the minimum bias elliptic flow in au+au collisions at rhic ( the dahsed line ) .",
    "it is not shown here , but experimental minimum bias @xmath52 in au+au collisions is well reproduced in minimally viscous hydrodynamics .",
    "it is interesting to note that in pb+pb collisions , elliptic flow is reduced by @xmath5 15% .",
    "reduction of elliptic flow in lhc has also been predicted by krieg and bleicher @xcite . in a parton recombination model , they studied the energy dependence of elliptic flow in heavy ion collisions from ags to lhc energy .",
    "it was observed that from rhic to lhc energy elliptic flow decreases .",
    "parton transport models also predict less elliptic flow in lhc energy than in au+au collisions at rhic @xcite .    in fig.[f8",
    "] , in four panels , we have shown the minimally viscous dynamics predictions for elliptic flow in 0 - 10% , 10 - 20% , 20 - 30% and , 30 - 40% centrality pb+pb collisions at lhc .",
    "the black , red and green lines corresponds to elliptic flow for @xmath44 , @xmath45 and protons .",
    "species dependence is similar to that at rhic energy . at large @xmath2 ,",
    "elliptic flow between different species are marginally different .",
    "species dependence is seen only at low @xmath2 , lighter the particle , more is the elliptic flow .",
    "we have not shown any comparison with @xmath52 at rhic .",
    "but as with the minimum bias collisions , elliptic flow in different centrality ranges of collisions is reduced at lhc .",
    "to summarise , in a minimally viscous ( @xmath0=0.08 ) hydrodynamics , we have given predictions for several experimental observables in pb+pb collisions at lhc energy ( @xmath1=5.5 tev ) .",
    "assuming that particle multiplicity increase logarithmically with c.m .",
    "energy , we have extrapolated the lower energy data ( tabulated by the phenix collaboration ) to obtain an estimate of particle multiplicity at lhc energy collisions .",
    "our estimate indicate that a pb+pb collision with participant number @xmath4=350 , produces @xmath5 927 charged particles .",
    "the initial central entropy density of the fluid ( @xmath32=180 @xmath33 ) in pb+pb collisions was fixed to reproduce the extrapolated particle multiplicity . the initial time",
    "( @xmath7 ) and freeze - out temperature ( @xmath36 ) were kept fixed at the value , @xmath7=0.6 fm and @xmath36=130 mev , as it was obtained in the analysis of au+au data in rhic energy collisions .",
