    "reduced - form point process models of correlated default timing are widely used to measure portfolio credit risk and to value securities exposed to correlated default risk . computing the distribution of the loss from default in these models tends to be difficult , however , especially in bottom - up formulations with many names .",
    "semi - analytical transform methods have limited scope .",
    "monte carlo simulation is much more broadly applicable but can be slow for the large portfolios and longer time horizons common in practice .",
    "this paper develops an approximation to the distribution of the loss from default in large portfolios that may have a heterogenous structure .",
    "the approximation is valid for a class of reduced - form models in which a name defaults at a stochastic intensity that is influenced by an idiosyncratic risk factor process , a systematic risk factor process @xmath0 common to all names in the pool , and the portfolio loss rate .",
    "it is based on a law of large numbers for the portfolio loss rate .",
    "the limiting portfolio loss is not deterministic but follows a stochastic process driven by @xmath0 , indicating that the exposure to the systematic risk can not be diversified .",
    "we show that the density of the limiting measure , if it exists , satisfies a nonlinear stochastic partial differential equation ( spde ) driven by @xmath0 .",
    "we develop a numerical method for solving this equation .",
    "the method is based on the observation that certain moments of the limiting measure satisfy an infinite system of sdes .",
    "these sdes are driven by the systematic risk factor @xmath0 ; a truncated system can be solved using a discretization scheme , for example .",
    "the solution to the sde system leads to the solution to the spde through an inverse moment problem .",
    "it also leads to the distribution of the limiting portfolio loss , which we propose as an approximation to the distribution of the loss from default for a large portfolio .",
    "estimators of portfolio value at risk and other risk measures are immediate from the limiting loss distribution .",
    "numerical tests illustrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the approximation for large but finite portfolios .",
    "we find a substantial reduction in computational effort over the alternative of direct monte carlo simulation of the high - dimensional original stochastic system .",
    "the accuracy of the approximation mainly depends on the portfolio size @xmath1 and the sensitivity to the systematic risk factor . for a given sensitivity ,",
    "the accuracy increases with @xmath1 , as expected .",
    "the higher the sensitivity to the systematic risk , the higher the variance of the loss distribution and the more accurate is the approximation for fixed @xmath1 .",
    "the approximation is remarkably accurate in the tail of the loss distribution .",
    "this renders it particularly suitable for the estimation of risk measures for the large pools of loans commonly held by banks .",
    "large portfolio approximations were first studied by . in vasicek s static model of a homogenous pool ,",
    "firms default independently of one another conditional on a normally distributed random variable representing a systematic risk factor . because the losses from defaults are conditionally i.i.d .",

    "they obtain an spde driven by that brownian motion for the density of the limiting measure , which they solve using a finite element method .",
    "the conditional independence of defaults can also be exploited to analyze the tail behavior of the losses in large , not necessarily homogenous , portfolios using large deviations arguments ; see and .",
    "the analysis in this paper differs from that in the aforementioned articles in several important respects .",
    "we study a class of dynamic point process models of correlated default timing in which a firm defaults at a stochastic intensity process .",
    "the intensity is influenced by an idiosyncratic risk factor process following a square - root diffusion , a systematic risk factor process following a diffusion with arbitrary coefficient functions , and the portfolio loss rate . to address the heterogeneity of a portfolio , the intensity parameters of each name are allowed to be different .",
    "the choice for dependence of the intensity on idiosyncratic and systematic risk factor processes is motivated by the empirical findings of .",
    "the choice for dependence of the intensity on the portfolio loss is motivated by the empirical results of , who find that defaults have a statistically significant feedback effect on the surviving firms .",
    "the self - exciting behavior of defaults violates the conditional independence property that is exploited in the aforementioned articles .",
    "it complicates the asymptotic analysis and induces an integral term in the drift of the spde governing the density of the limiting measure .",
    "the exposure to the systematic risk leads to the noise term in the spde , which is given by an it integral against the brownian motion driving the systematic risk diffusion .",
    "the solution to the spde governs the distribution of the limiting loss at all future horizons , facilitating the computation of the `` loss surface . ''",
    "this dynamic perspective is absent in the static formulations considered in most of the aforementioned articles .",
    "the law of large numbers ( lln ) proved in this paper significantly extends an earlier result in , which assumes ornstein - uhlenbeck dynamics for the systematic risk factor and the sensitivity of the intensity to the systematic risk to vanish in the large - portfolio limit .",
    "the lln developed here allows for general diffusion dynamics for the systematic risk factor .",
    "moreover , the exposure of an intensity to this diffusion is not required to vanish , generating a much richer , non - deterministic limiting behavior governed by an spde rather than a pde .",
    "the treatment of these features requires additional arguments .",
    "our main result ( theorem [ t : mainlln0 ] ) develops the stochastic evolution equation that the limiting empirical measure satisfies .",
    "if the limiting empirical measure admits a density , then an integration by parts argument shows that the density satisfies an spde .",
    "the filtered martingale problem is used to identify the limit and prove the lln .",
    "a major difficulty in the identification of the limit is the solution of a coupled system of sdes , which we address using fixed - point arguments .",
    "in contrast to , this system does not easily decouple in the more general setting considered here .",
    "the analysis of the fixed - point arguments is complicated due to the square - root singularity .",
    "prove a lln for a related system , taking an intensity as a function of an idiosyncratic risk factor , a systematic risk factor , and the portfolio loss rate .",
    "the risk factors follow diffusion processes whose coefficients may depend on the portfolio loss . in that formulation ,",
    "the impact of a default on the dynamics of the surviving firms is permanent . in our work ,",
    "an intensity depends on the path of the portfolio loss .",
    "therefore , the impact of a default on the surviving firms may be transient and fade away with time .",
    "there is a recovery effect .",
    "other interacting particle systems with permanent default impact are analyzed by and , who take an intensity as a function of the portfolio loss rate . in a model with local interaction , take the intensity of a name as a function of the state of the names in a specified neighborhood of that name .",
    "these papers prove llns for the portfolio loss and develop gaussian approximations to the portfolio loss distribution based on central limit theorems .",
    "the interacting particle system which we propose and study includes firm - specific sources of default risk and addresses an additional source of default clustering , namely the exposure of a firm to a systematic risk factor process .",
    "this exposure generates a random limiting behavior .",
