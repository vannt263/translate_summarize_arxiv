    "the result of ramagge , robertson and steger provided the first occurrences of property rd in  higher rank \" situations .",
    "this was extended in @xcite , where lafforgue proves that all cocompact lattices in @xmath17 ( and @xmath18 ) have property rd .",

    "we are interested here in interpolation between ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .      the _ rank _ of a non positively curved metric space @xmath19 is an asymptotic invariant of @xmath19 usually defined as the dimension of maximal flats in @xmath19 .",

    "proper means that stabilizers are uniformly finite .",
    "the role of triangle polyhedra below is to allow rank interpolation within a tractable geometrical framework .",
    "the word triangle refers to the coxeter diagram of flats and follows the classical terminology for tits buildings @xcite .",
    "all flats in @xmath19 are isometric to euclidean planes @xmath22 tessellated by equilateral triangles ( i.e. they are of type @xmath16 ) .",

    "a triangle polyhedron is said to have    * _ rank 1 _ if it is hyperbolic , * _ rank 2 _ if it is symmetric , i.e. , if it is a triangle building ( @xcite ) .    for other triangle polyhedra",

    "can be exhibited at the microscopic , mesoscopic , and macroscopic  or rather asymptotic  scale .",
    "we first discuss the latter along with the notion of _ polynomial ( growth ) rank_.

    "definition 2 is generalized to arbitrary countable groups endowed with a length ( e.g. finitely generated groups with the word length ) in section [ reminder ] . while being in the non amenable setting this generalization is strongly reminiscent of the theory of _ growth of groups _ ( for which we refer to @xcite and references therein ) and",
    "will thus be called _ polynomial growth rank_. it relies on tools that arise from the study of property rd , allowing to merely retain the polynomial growth of ` flats ' rather than sharp flatness .",
    "subexponential and exponential growth rank can be defined analogously .",
    "the proof that polynomial growth rank coincide with the above definition [ def2 ] for triangle groups is given in section [ rd - triangles ] ( proposition [ polrk - same ] ) .",

    "was already known by a theorem of chatterji and ruane @xcite .",
    "subexponential growth rank does not imply property rd in general , but it does imply some useful subexponential variations of it ( see the end of section [ sec22 ] ) .",

    "local_. nonetheless , large rank tends to propagate to the asymptotic level and groups of rank @xmath0 , at least for some of them ( see theorem [ th4 ] ) , have exponential rank in the sense of the previous subsection ( yet their rank is strictly lower than that of triangle buildings ) .",
