    "our knowledge about the features of nuclear matter at saturation density @xmath6 is based primarily on the masses of nuclei , like the density @xmath7 @xmath8 , energy per particle @xmath9 mev and symmetry energy @xmath10 mev @xcite .",
    "however , the variation of the symmetry energy with density is still intensely debated @xcite . the symmetry energy which characterizes the isospin - dependent part of the equation of state ( eos ) of asymmetric nuclear matter , plays a crucial role in many issues of nuclear physics as well as astrophysics .",

    "recently , some progress has been made in determining the density dependence of @xmath17 around the saturation density @xmath6 from nuclear isospin diffusion , double n / p ratio in intermediate energy heavy - ion collisions , pygmy dipole resonance , neutron skin thickness and the nuclear binding energy .",
    "a description of isospin diffusion data with a symmetry energy of @xmath21 with @xmath22 has been obtained by using an isospin - dependent boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( ibuu ) transport model @xcite , and a value of @xmath23 is inferred from the preequilibrium neutron and proton transverse emissions comparing to ibuu transport calculations @xcite .",

    "more recently , the analysis of isospin diffusion and double ratio data involving neutron and proton spectra by an improved quantum molecular dynamics transport model suggests @xmath26 with @xmath27 @xcite .",

    "it has been established that the neutron skin thickness @xmath28 , given by the difference of neutron and proton root - mean - square radii of heavy nuclei , correlates linearly with the slope @xmath1 around the saturation @xcite . although the theoretical predictions on @xmath17 with the current nuclear mean field methods and neutron skin thickness are extremely diverse , this correlation is universal in the realm of mean field theory as it is based on widely different nuclear functionals @xcite .",

    "let us first establish a relation of the three quantities . with the relation @xmath30 describing the density dependence of the symmetry energy @xcite , one can obtain @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and thus a correlation of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be derived @xmath33 for the other density dependent behavior @xmath34 , we have @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
