    "fluidized granular media exhibit a plethora of fascinating pattern - formation phenomena that have been subjects of much recent interest @xcite . in this work",
    "we address thermal ( buoyancy - driven ) granular convection @xcite .",
    "being unrelated to the shear or time - dependence introduced by the system boundaries , it resembles the rayleigh - bnard convection in classical fluid @xcite and its compressible modifications @xcite . in classical fluid convection requires an externally imposed negative temperature gradient , that is a temperature gradient in the direction opposite to gravity . in a vibrofluidized granular medium a negative temperature gradient sets in spontaneously because of the energy loss by inelastic collisions .",
    "convection develops when the absolute value of the temperature gradient is large enough . in the simplest model of inelastic hard spheres that we will use",
    "it happens when the inelasticity coefficient @xmath0 exceeds a critical value depending on the rest of the parameters of the system .",
    "here @xmath1 is the coefficient of normal restitution of particle collisions .",
    "thermal granular convection was first observed in molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of a system of inelastically colliding disks in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) square box @xcite .",
    "the boundaries of the box @xcite did not introduce any shear or time - dependence : the system was driven by a stress - free thermalizing base .",
    "the top wall was perfectly elastic , while the lateral boundaries were either elastic or periodic .",
    "experiment with a highly fluidized three - dimensional granular flow @xcite gives strong evidence for thermal convection , though energy loss at the side walls introduces complications @xcite . a clear identification of thermal convection in experiment requires a large aspect ratio in the horizontal direction , so that _ multiple _ convection cells can be observed .",
    "md simulations in 2d of a vibrofluidized granular system with a large aspect ratio indeed show multiple convection cells @xcite .",
    "this work deals with a theory of thermal granular convection in a system with a large aspect ratio .",
    "recently , a continuum model of thermal granular convection has been formulated @xcite in the framework of the navier - stokes granular hydrodynamics . in the dilute limit the navier - stokes hydrodynamics ( or , more precisely , gasdynamics )",
    "is systematically derivable from more fundamental kinetic equations @xcite . like any other hydrodynamic approach , the navier - stokes hydrodynamics",
    "demands small knudsen numbers for its validity .",
    "in addition , it has been shown that at moderate inelasticities @xmath2 non - hydrodynamic effects ( such as the lack of scale separation , the normal stress difference and non - gaussianity in the particle velocity distribution ) may become important @xcite .",
    "therefore , the navier - stokes granular hydrodynamics is expected to be accurate quantitatively only for nearly elastic collisions , @xmath3 .",
    "though restrictive , the nearly elastic limit is conceptually important .",
    "also , one can expect some of the results , obtained in this limit , to be still qualitatively valid for larger inelasticities , such as those encountered in experiment .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the full set of nonlinear hydrodynamic equations for thermal granular convection was solved numerically in a 2d box with aspect ratio 1 .",
    "it was observed , in qualitative agreement with md simulations @xcite , that the static state of the system ( a steady state with a zero mean flow ) gives way to convection via a supercritical bifurcation , the inelasticity @xmath2 being the control parameter .",
    "the present work employs the same hydrodynamic formulation @xcite to perform a systematic _ linear stability _ analysis of the static state .",
    "we determine the convection threshold as a function of the scaled parameters of the problem and of the horizontal wave number of small perturbations .",
    "this analysis makes it possible to predict the convection threshold and determine the morphology of the convection cells in a system with an arbitrary aspect ratio , including an infinite horizontal layer , a standard setting for convection in classical fluids @xcite .",
    "we also formulate a simple _ necessary _ ( but not sufficient ) criterion for thermal granular convection in terms of the schwarzschild s criterion , well - known in thermal convection of ( compressible ) classical fluids @xcite .",
    "finally , we take the limit of a zero gravity and establish the connection between thermal convection and a recently discovered phase - separation instability @xcite .",
    "let a big number of identical smooth hard disks with diameter @xmath4 and mass @xmath5 move and inelastically collide inside an infinite two - dimensional horizontal layer with height @xmath6 .",
    "the gravity acceleration @xmath7 is in the negative @xmath8 direction .",
    "the system is driven by a rapidly vibrating base .",
    "we shall model it in a simplified way by prescribing a constant granular temperature @xmath9 at @xmath10 .",
    "the top wall is assumed elastic .",
    "hydrodynamics deals with coarse - grained fields : the number density of grains @xmath11 , granular temperature @xmath12 and mean flow velocity @xmath13 . in the dilute limit ,",
    "the scaled governing equations are @xcite : @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the total derivative , @xmath18 is the stress tensor , @xmath19 is the rate of deformation tensor , @xmath20 is the deviatoric part of @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the identity tensor . in the dilute limit ,",
    "the bulk viscosity of the gas is negligible compared to the shear viscosity @xcite , so only the shear viscosity is taken into account .",
    "in addition , we have neglected the small viscous heating term in the heat balance equation ( [ heat ] ) . the inelastic contribution to the heat flux",
    "@xcite is proportional to @xmath2 and can be safely neglected at small @xmath2 . in the 2d geometry , the three scaled parameters entering eqs .",
    "( [ momentum ] ) and ( [ heat ] ) are the froude number @xmath23 , the knudsen number @xmath24 and the relative heat loss parameter @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath26 is the total number of particles per unit length in the horizontal direction , divided by the layer height @xmath6",
    ". it will be convenient to use the relative heat loss number @xmath27 instead of @xmath2 . in eqs .",
    "( [ cont])-([heat ] ) , the distance is measured in the units of @xmath6 , the time in units of @xmath28 , the density in units of @xmath26 , the temperature in units of @xmath9 , and the velocity in units of @xmath29 .",
    "the navier - stokes hydrodynamic model is expected to be valid when the mean free path of the particles is much smaller than any length scale ( and the mean collision time is much smaller than any time scale ) described hydrodynamically .",
    "this implies , in particular , that the knudsen number should be small : @xmath30 .",
    "the boundary conditions for the temperature are @xmath31 at the base and a zero normal component of the heat flux at the upper wall : @xmath32 . for velocities we demand zero normal components and slip ( no stress ) conditions at the boundaries . the total number of particles in the system is conserved : @xmath33 where we have introduced the horizontal dimension @xmath34 .",
    "the hydrodynamic problem is characterized by the three scaled numbers @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath27 .",
    "the simplest steady state of the system is the static state : no mean flow . at a nonzero gravity the density @xmath37 and temperature @xmath38 of the static state depend only on @xmath8 , and",
    "are described by the equations @xmath39 where the primes denote the @xmath8-derivatives .",
    "the boundary conditions are @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the normalization condition is @xmath42 the static state ( see fig . [ steady1 ] ) is characterized by _ two _ scaled numbers : @xmath35 and @xmath27 , and can be found analytically by transforming from the eulerian coordinate @xmath8 to the lagrangian mass coordinate @xmath43 @xcite . at large enough @xmath27 ,",
    "a density inversion develops : a denser ( heavier ) gas is located on the top of an under - dense ( lighter ) gas .",
    "this is clearly a destabilizing effect that drives thermal convection .",
    "however , this effect is neither sufficient , nor necessary for convection , see below .",
    "the actual ( necessary and sufficient ) criterion should take into account the heat conduction and viscosity that scale like @xmath36 in the governing equations and have a stabilizing role .",
    "a small sinusoidal perturbation in the horizontal direction is unstable with respect to convection if the relative heat loss parameter @xmath27 exceeds a critical value that depends on @xmath35 , @xmath36 and the horizontal wave number .",
    "the linear stability analysis involves linearization of eqs .",
    "( [ cont])-([heat ] ) around the static solutions @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the linearized equations are @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 denote small perturbations . exploiting the translational symmetry of the static state in the horizontal direction",
    ", one can consider a single fourier mode in @xmath52 : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the scaled growth / decay rate , and @xmath55 is the scaled horizontal wave number .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ modes ] ) into eqs .",
    "( [ cont1])-([heat1 ] ) and eliminating @xmath56 , we obtain three homogeneous ordinary differential equations that can be written as a single equation for the eigenvector @xmath57 $ ] , corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath54 : @xmath58 where @xmath59 @xmath60 while the elements of matrix @xmath61 are @xmath62 we have denoted for brevity @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the boundary conditions for the functions @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the following : @xmath68 equation ( [ vectorsystem ] ) with the boundary conditions ( [ boundcond ] ) define a linear _ boundary - value _ problem : there are three boundary conditions at the base and three at the top .",
    "a simple numerical procedure ( realized in matlab ) enabled us to avoid the unpleasant shooting in three parameters .",
    "the procedure employs the linearity of the problem .",
    "we first complement the three boundary conditions at the base by three _",
    "arbitrary _ boundary conditions _ at the base _ , and compute numerically three independent solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ vectorsystem ] ) .",
    "general _ solution can be represented as a linear combination of these three independent solutions that includes three arbitrary coefficients .",
    "demanding that the three remaining boundary conditions _ at the top _ be satisfied , we obtain three homogeneous linear algebraic equations for the coefficients .",
    "a nontrivial solution requires that the determinant vanish , which yields the eigenvalue @xmath54 .",
    "varying @xmath27 at fixed @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath55 , we determine the critical value @xmath69 for instability from the condition @xmath70 .",
    "we found this algorithm to be accurate and efficient .    in the whole region of the parameter space that we explored we found that @xmath71 at the instability onset",
    "therefore , thermal granular convection does not exhibit overstability and can be analyzed in terms of marginal stability .",
    "figure [ rkx]a shows the marginal stability curves versus the horizontal wave number @xmath55 at a fixed @xmath36 and two different values of @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the curves exhibit minima @xmath72 , similarly to the convection in classical fluids @xcite .",
    "therefore , the convection threshold in the horizontally infinite layer is @xmath73 .",
    "close to the onset , the expected horizontal size of the convection cell is @xmath74 .",
    "figure [ cell ] depicts these convection cells obtained by plotting the field lines of the respective velocity field @xmath75 found numerically .",
    "one can see that at small @xmath35 the cells occupy the whole layer of granular gas and are elongated in the horizontal direction . at large @xmath35 the cells",
    "are effectively located near the base , and their aspect ratio is close to unity .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     figure 2b corresponds to a zero gravity : @xmath76 . here",
    "a different symmetry - breaking instability occurs : the one that leads to _ phase separation _ @xcite .",
    "when @xmath27 exceeds the marginal stability threshold @xmath77 , the laterally symmetric stripe of enhanced particle density at the top wall becomes unstable and gives way to a 2d steady state .",
    "in contrast to the convection , the new steady state with a broken translational symmetry is _ static _ : no mean flow .",
    "the quantity @xmath77 can be calculated analytically @xcite . in our present notation , it is determined from the algebraic equation @xmath78 , where @xmath79 .",
    "this yields @xmath80 .",
    "the minimum of the marginal stability curve occurs here at @xmath81 , that is for an infinitely long wavelength .",
    "we found that the crossover between the two instabilities is continuous .",
    "the dependences of @xmath82 and @xmath83 on the froude number @xmath35 are shown in fig .",
    "one can see that the @xmath84 dependence is non - monotonic .",
    "a stronger gravity is favorable for convection at very small @xmath35 ( as fig .",
    "[ rkx]a also shows ) .",
    "however , this tendency is reversed at @xmath85 , and @xmath86 starts to grow with @xmath35 until it saturates at large @xmath35 . in its turn",
    ", @xmath83 goes down monotonically with @xmath35 and vanishes at @xmath76 .",
    "the decrease is quite slow at intermediate @xmath35 , but becomes very rapid at very small @xmath35 . as the phase separation instability does not exist in classical fluid , this low-@xmath35 behavior is unique for granular fluid .",
    "the large-@xmath35 limit deserves a special attention . here",
    "the granulate is localized at the base .",
    "this regime is convenient in experiment , as particle collisions with the top wall ( which are in reality inelastic ) are avoided .",
    "a natural unit of distance in this regime is @xmath87 , while the time should be scaled to @xmath88 .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath26 is defined now as the total number of particles per unit length in the horizontal direction , divided by @xmath89 .",
    "after rescaling the froude number @xmath35 drops out of eqs .",
    "( [ cont])-([heat ] ) and enters the problem only via the top wall position @xmath90 . for @xmath91 the top wall",
    "can be safely moved to infinity , and @xmath35 drops out of the problem completely .",
    "therefore , at large @xmath35 , the convection threshold @xmath82 should depend only on @xmath36 .",
    "our numerical results fully support this prediction , see fig .",
    "how should @xmath83 behave at large @xmath35 ?",
    "let us reintroduce for a moment the `` physical '' ( dimensional ) horizontal wave number @xmath92 . the scaled critical wave number @xmath93",
    ". as the product @xmath94 is the scaled wave number in the newly rescaled variables , it should be independent of @xmath35 at large @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , @xmath83 should be proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "figure [ kxf ] shows that the quantity @xmath95 indeed approaches a constant ( that depends on @xmath36 ) at large @xmath35 .",
    "these results give , for fixed values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the necessary and sufficient criterion for convection .",
    "it is often useful to also have a simpler and easier - to - interpret criterion , even if approximate .",
    "a simplified criterion for convection can be obtained by neglecting the viscosity and heat conduction terms in the linearized equations ( [ cont1])-([heat1 ] ) , that is by taking the limit @xmath96 . as the viscosity and heat conduction act against convection",
    ", this procedure obviously yields a _ necessary _ , but not sufficient , criterion for convection .    without the dissipative terms , eqs .",
    "( [ cont1])-([heat1 ] ) coincide with the linearized equations of _ ideal _ hydrodynamics of _ classical _ fluid with specified static profiles of temperature @xmath45 and density @xmath44 . even for this idealized problem , the exact criterion for convection can be obtained only numerically , and the result depends explicitly on the specific profiles @xmath45 and @xmath44 .",
    "there is , however , a simple and general limit here in terms of the schwarzschild s criterion @xcite that yields a lower bound for the convection threshold .",
    "the schwarzschild s criterion guarantees that there is _ no _ convection if the entropy of the fluid in the static state @xmath97 grows with the height , that is @xmath98 for _ any _ @xmath8 .",
    "for the nearly elastic hard sphere model in 2d the granular entropy in the dilute limit is @xmath99 .",
    "[ importantly , we are not making here any additional assumption : this simple constitutive relation for @xmath100 was already used in eqs .",
    "( [ cont])-([heat ] ) . ]",
    "therefore , the schwarzschild s criterion can be rewritten in terms of the static temperature and density profiles and their first derivatives . for a given @xmath35 ,",
    "the static profiles are determined solely by the relative heat loss parameter @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , the schwarzschild s criterion yields a critical value @xmath101 so that at @xmath102 there is _ no _ convection .",
    "the opposite inequality @xmath103 yields a _ necessary _ ( but of course not sufficient ) criterion for convection .",
    "how to find @xmath104 ?",
    "at small enough @xmath27 the spatial derivative of the entropy , @xmath105 , is positive at any height @xmath106 . by increasing @xmath27",
    "we observe that , at the critical value @xmath101 , the entropy derivative @xmath105 vanishes at some point @xmath8 .",
    "it is crucial that this point is always @xmath10 .",
    "increasing @xmath27 further , we would already have an _ interval _ of heights where @xmath107 .",
    "therefore , _ the schwarzschild s curve _ @xmath108 can be obtained from the condition @xmath109 .",
    "this curve , obtained numerically , is shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "as expected , the exact ( necessary and sufficient ) convection threshold curve always lies _ above _ the schwarzschild s curve .",
    "the small-@xmath35 and large-@xmath35 asymptotics of the schwarzschild s curve can be obtained analytically .",
    "let us first consider the case of @xmath110 . as will be seen from the result , here @xmath111 too , and one can represent the steady - state solutions as @xmath112 , and @xmath113 , where @xmath114 and @xmath115 . substituting these expressions into eq .",
    "( [ steady ] ) and keeping only the first order quantities , we obtain two very simple linear differential equations .",
    "solving them with the respective boundary and normalization conditions , we obtain @xmath116 and @xmath117 . the condition @xmath109 then yields the desired small-@xmath35 asymptotics : @xmath118 .    at @xmath91",
    ", one can conveniently use the analytic solution for the static profiles in the lagrangian mass coordinate @xcite . in this limit @xmath119 where @xmath120 , and",
    "@xmath121 is the modified bessel function of the first kind .",
    "( recall that here we rescale the eulerian coordinate @xmath8 by @xmath87 and define @xmath26 as the number of particles per unit length in the horizontal direction divided by @xmath89 . )",
    "using eqs .",

    "we have @xmath128 everywhere , so @xmath129 indeed corresponds to the schwarzschild s criterion .",
    "the value of @xmath130 shows up as the large-@xmath35 plateau of the schwarzschild s curve in fig .",
    "[ rcf ] .",
    "now let us return to the exact ( necessary and sufficient ) criterion for convection , found by solving the full linearized problem numerically .",
    "the dependence of the convection threshold @xmath82 on the knudsen number @xmath36 ( at a fixed @xmath35 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ rck ] . @xmath82 grows with @xmath36 , because the viscosity and heat conduction ( both of which scale like @xmath36 ) tend to suppress convection @xcite . as @xmath131 the viscosity and heat conduction become negligible .",
    "still , one should expect that the limiting value of the critical heat loss parameter @xmath132 is greater than the schwarzschild s lower bound @xmath108 .",
    "this is indeed what is seen in fig .",
    "[ rck ] , where the schwarzschild s value @xmath133 is shown by the empty circle .",
    "we performed a linear stability analysis of the static state in a horizontal layer of granular gas driven from below .",
    "the hydrodynamic theory @xcite that we employed in our analysis is expected to be valid when the mean free path of the particles is much smaller than any length scale described hydrodynamically .",
    "we have found the convection threshold , in terms of the relative heat loss number @xmath27 , versus the two other scaled numbers of the problem : the froude number @xmath35 and the knudsen number @xmath36 .",
    "we have predicted the morphology of convection cells at the onset of convection .",
    "as @xmath134 , the convection instability goes over continuously into the phase - separation instability @xcite . at large @xmath35 the convection threshold depends only on @xmath36 .",
    "we established a simple connection between thermal granular convection and classical thermal convection of ideal compressible fluid .",
    "the connection is given in terms of the schwarzschild s criterion , a universal necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for thermal convection .",
    "a further development of the theory should account for the excluded - volume effects @xcite .",
    "importantly , the simple schwarzschild s criterion will be readily available in the finite - density theory .",
    "indeed , this criterion requires only the knowledge of the static profiles of the granular temperature and density and the constitutive relation for the granular entropy .",
