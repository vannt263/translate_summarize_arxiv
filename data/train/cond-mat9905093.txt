    "recent experiments on mesoscopic superconducting aluminum structures with sizes smaller than the temperature dependent coherence length @xmath4 and penetration depth @xmath5 have shown the influence of the sample topology on the superconducting critical parameters , like the normal / superconducting phase boundary @xmath0 ( i.e. the critical temperature @xmath6 in the presence of an applied magnetic field @xmath7 ) @xcite .",
    "many different topologies have been studied experimentally and theoretically .",
    "first of all , there are structures made of quasi - one - dimensional strips , which can be further classified into single loops @xcite ( where @xmath0 shows the well - known periodic little - parks oscillations @xcite ) , multiloop structures @xcite ( double loop , yin - yang , lasso , 2@xmath82-cell , etc . ) and large infinite networks @xcite .",
    "the theories used to calculate the @xmath0 for these structures are based on the linearized ginzburg - landau theory , using either the de gennes - alexander formalism @xcite or the london limit @xcite .",
    "the fluxoid quantization constraint ( i.e. the requirement that the order parameter is uniquely defined after integration of the phase gradient along a closed superconducting contour ) in these multiply connected structures gives rise to the oscillatory shape of the phase boundaries @xmath0 , superimposed usually on a parabolic background .",
    "secondly , surface superconductivity effects in ( circular or square shaped ) single dots @xcite and antidots @xcite ( i.e. one antidot in a plain film ) have been studied intensively . in these structures , @xmath0 consists of oscillations , which are pseudoperiodic .",
    "the appearance of the giant vortex state , where superconductivity is nucleated only near the sample boundary @xcite , is due to the quantization of the phase winding number @xmath9 of the superconducting order parameter @xmath10 ( this is equivalent to fluxoid quantization ) . for cylindrically symmetric structures ,",
    "one refers to @xmath9 as the angular ( or orbital ) momentum quantum number @xcite . for the states @xmath11 , the dot ( or antidot ) area is threaded by multiples @xmath9 of the superconducting flux quantum @xmath12",
    "this `` surface superconductivity '' gives rise to a quasi - linear critical field @xmath13 versus temperature @xmath14 , which we will further compare with the experimental @xmath0 .",
    "the experimental studies of the antidot structure are usually carried out on samples with regular lattices of antidots .",
    "it was shown by bezryadin _",
    "that , at sufficiently high magnetic fields , the antidots behave independently @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "the antidots create efficient pinning centers for the flux line lattice @xcite .",
    "we will present the measured phase boundaries @xmath0 of three different topologies , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ atpfig1 ] .",
    "the three structures studied are a filled microsquare , and two squares with 2 and 4 square antidots respectively .",
    "similar structures were studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the 4-antidot structure was proposed as a basic cell for a memory based on flux logic . in those papers ,",
    "different stable vortex configurations were detected at low magnetic fields .",
    "the goal of the present report is to study the influence of the antidots inside a microsquare on the crossover from the `` network '' behavior at low fields to a giant vortex state@xcite at higher fields , and whether eventually the two configurations ( vortices pinned by the antidots and the giant vortex state ) can coexist . we will mainly focus on the high magnetic field regime . in a structure with one single antidot ( i.e. a loop , as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) as well , the presence of a giant vortex state can be anticipated at sufficiently high magnetic fields .",
    "in such a system , however , the phase winding number @xmath9 will be identical for every contour encircling the antidot .",
    "the development of the giant vortex state is accompanied by a transition from a parabolic background in @xmath0 to a quasi - linear @xmath0 behavior .",
    "the crossover field is strongly dependent on the size and the aspect ratio of the loop and will be the subject of a future paper . for the loop studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , the magnetic field was clearly not sufficiently high to reach this transition regime .",
    "the advantage of a structure with more than one antidot is the property that each antidot can in principle contain a different number @xmath9 of flux quanta @xmath15 .",
    "simultaneously , a quantum number @xmath9 is attributed to the outside square .",
    "the observed cusps in @xmath0 can then be related to the switching of either the quantum state of an antidot , or of the whole square .",
    "for the 4-antidot structure , a collective or network behavior can be expected at low magnetic fields@xcite , while a single object regime @xcite can be reached at higher fields , where at @xmath0 a surface superconducting sheath develops near the sample boundary .",
    "the comparison of the @xmath0 data obtained on the perforated al microstructures with that of a reference microsquare without antidots confirms the presence of a giant vortex state in the three structures in the high magnetic field regime .",
    "three different microstructures , shown in fig .  [ atpfig1 ] , have been studied .",
    "a square dot , with side @xmath16=2.04  @xmath17 is taken as a reference sample ( a ) ; a square of side @xmath16=2.04  @xmath17 , with four 0.46@xmath180.46  @xmath19 square antidots ( b ) ; and a square , side @xmath16=2.14  @xmath17 , with two 0.52@xmath18 0.52  @xmath19 antidots , placed along a diagonal ( c ) . for the 4-antidot sample ( b ) the width of the superconducting outer stripes is 0.33  @xmath17 and the inner stripes are 0.46  @xmath17 wide . for the 2-antidot sample ( c )",
    "the outer stripes are 0.35 @xmath17 wide , and the non - perforated areas are 1.27 @xmath17 wide .",
    "the dimensions are summarized in table  [ t1 ] .",
    "electrical contacts have been attached to the samples using an ultrasonic wire bonding technique on the @xmath20  @xmath19 large contact pads .",
    "the three samples have been prepared in a single run by thermal evaporation of @xmath21 pure al on a sio@xmath22 substrate .",
    "the patterns are defined using e - beam lithography on a bilayer of pmma resist previous to the deposition of a @xmath23  nm thick aluminum film .",
    "after the evaporation , the liftoff was performed using dichloremethane .",
    "the structures were characterized by x - ray , sem and afm ( fig .",
    "[ atpfig1 ] ) .",
    "four - point resistance measurements were performed in a @xmath24he cryostat , using a par 124a lock - in amplifier .",
    "a measuring current of 100  na r.m.s . with a frequency of 27  hz was used , which is depressing the @xmath6 by only a few millikelvins , in the whole magnetic field range .",
    "the @xmath0 measurements are done in a continuous run , keeping the sample resistance typically at @xmath25 of the normal state value and sweeping the magnetic field slowly while recording the temperature .",
    "the magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the structures , and a temperature stability better than 0.5  mk was achieved .",
    "in fig .  [ atpfig2 ]",
    "we present the experimental phase boundary @xmath0 of the three structures .",
    "the measured @xmath0 values were independent of the direction of the magnetic field scans and were reproduced in several measurement rounds . in this paper",
    "we will always plot @xmath0 in the usual way , i.e. with the @xmath6-axis pointing from the highest to the lowest temperature .",
    "peaks in the @xmath0 plots are then in reality local minima of the critical temperature @xmath6 .    for the reference full square , we observe pseudoperiodic oscillations in @xmath0 superimposed with an almost linear background , where the period of the oscillations slightly decreases with increasing field , in agreement with previous studies @xcite .",
    "_ these observations are characteristic for the presence of the giant vortex state .",
    "_ for the perforated microstructures , _ two different magnetic field regimes _ can be distinguished . at _ high magnetic fields _ , the oscillations in @xmath0 are pseudoperiodic , just as the @xmath0 of the full square .",
    "for the _ low field _",
    "part of the phase diagram , distinct features appear ( i.e. , below @xmath26 mt ) : for the 2-antidot sample we observe the same number of peaks compared to the full square , but with a considerable shift of the positions of the first peaks . compared to the full square @xmath0",
    ", a new series of peaks , positioned symmetrically with respect to @xmath27 mt , is found for the 4-antidot sample , as can be expected for a 2@xmath28 cell network .    in what follows",
    ", we will investigate in detail the shape of @xmath0 in the two flux regimes for the three structures .",
    "we will discuss our results in terms of the existing models , within the ginzburg - landau  ( gl ) theory , developed for mesoscopic structures with a cylindrical symmetry ( disks , loops ) which have been successfully applied earlier to interpret the results obtained in mesoscopic square structures @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 curve measured for the full square structure is very similar to the result obtained from a calculation @xcite for a mesoscopic disk in the presence of a magnetic field ( indicated as @xmath13 in fig .",
    "[ atpfig2]a ) . in that model the linearized first gl  equation",
    "is solved with the boundary condition for an ideal superconductor / insulator interface : @xmath29 which is the condition that no supercurrent can flow perpendicular to the interface . in the linear approach",
    ", the vector potential @xmath30 is related to the applied magnetic field @xmath31 through @xmath32 . in order to obtain the solutions which fulfill the boundary condition ( eq .  ( [ boundaryconditions ] ) ) , one has to solve the equation : @xmath33 the function @xmath34 is the so - called kummer function of the first kind , @xmath35 is a real number depending on the phase winding number @xmath9 , which has to be obtained numerically by solving eq .",
    "( [ boundnum ] ) .",
    "the flux is defined as @xmath36 , @xmath37 being the radius of the disk .",
    "the @xmath38 is obtained via the relation : @xmath39 the upper critical field @xmath40 for a bulk superconductor is obtained when substituting @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ xitopb ] ) , which gives a linear relation between @xmath40 and @xmath14 . however , for a finite size superconductor , a third critical field @xmath13 can be found , because the ground state is obtained from solutions of eq .",
    "( [ boundnum ] ) with @xmath42 .",
    "superconductivity is concentrated near the sample edge ( for @xmath43 ) , while the `` normal '' core contains one or several flux quanta @xmath44 .",
    "this quasi - linear critical field @xmath45 is the analog of the surface critical field for a semi - infinite superconducting slab in contact with vacuum ( or insulator ) , where superconductivity persists in a surface sheath up to magnetic fields @xmath46 above the upper critical field @xcite .",
    "the series of peaks in the @xmath0 curve correspond to transitions between states with different angular momenta @xmath47 of the superconducting order parameter as successive flux quanta , @xmath48 , enter the superconductor .",
    "a comparison with the experimental result for a square structure was made in ref.@xcite . in a very recent paper by jadallah _",
    "_ @xcite the @xmath0 phase boundary is studied theoretically and is compared to the experimental @xmath0 curve for the full square , described in the present paper .",
    "following ref.@xcite , between @xmath2=0 and the first peak located at @xmath49 , the superconducting order parameter @xmath50 has angular momentum @xmath51 , and the reduced critical temperature is quadratic in @xmath52 :    @xmath53    the quasi - linear background at high flux , @xmath54 , follows the asymptotic expression :    @xmath55    the parameter @xmath56 represents the ratio of the ground state energy ( @xmath13 ) to the lowest bulk landau level ( @xmath40 ) and therefore coincides with the ratio @xmath57 at a fixed temperature . for @xmath58 , in other words for @xmath59 , the value @xmath60 .",
    "note that substituting @xmath61 in eq .",
    "( [ highfield ] ) gives the equation for @xmath62 ( or @xmath63 ) , indicated by the straight line labeled @xmath40 in fig .",
    "[ atpfig2]a .",
    "when matching the position of the experimental and theoretical peaks , we obtain a value for the field corresponding to one flux quantum , @xmath64 mt . this scaling leads to a very good agreement in the position of all the peaks ( see the inset of fig",
    ".  [ atpfig3 ] ) and strongly supports the validity of applying this model to our experiments . from @xmath65",
    "we obtain an effective area of 3.9  @xmath19 , close to the actual size of the structure , 4.2  @xmath19 .",
    "the introduction of this effective area is obviously not needed if the @xmath0 is compared with a calculation performed for a square @xcite .",
    "then , from eq .",
    "( [ lowfield ] ) , we find the coherence length , @xmath66=92  nm ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ atpfig2]a ) , and using the values for pure al and the ginzburg - landau expressions for _ dirty _",
    "superconductors@xcite , we can estimate the mean free path , @xmath67=7  nm , and the penetration depth , @xmath68=140  nm . the results for the three structures are summarized in table  [ t1 ] .",
    "the determined value @xmath69=92  nm might be a bit too low , since at low magnetic fields the electrical leads attached to the square can give rise to nonlocal effects @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , fitting the low field part of the experimental @xmath0 to eq .",
    "( 6 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite gives an increased @xmath69=95  nm .",
    "in contrast to the experimental result presented in ref.@xcite , which was obtained for a substantially larger , but circular dot , the field period can be matched to the theoretical predictions in the whole field interval .",
    "the distance @xmath70 between the peaks in @xmath38 follows the asymptotic limit @xmath71 . in our experiment",
    "@xmath70 reaches a nearly constant value for @xmath72 , with @xmath73  mt . when a sufficiently high magnetic field is applied to the sample , a superconducting edge state is formed , where superconductivity only nucleates within a surface layer of thickness @xmath74 .",
    "the remaining area acts like a normal core of radius @xmath75 , and carries @xmath9 flux quanta in its interior . due to the expanding normal core",
    ", the sample can be seen topologically as a loop of variable radius . for this reason",
    ", the @xmath0 of the dot shows little - parks - like oscillations , which are , however , nonperiodic .",
    "the magnetic period @xmath76 decreases , since the effective radius grows with increasing field .",
    "in contrast to the case of the loop , which has a parabolic background on @xmath0 , the background is quasi - linear , because of the additional energy cost ( i.e. extra reduction of @xmath6 ) for depressing superconductivity in the sample core .",
    "as the applied magnetic field grows this giant vortex core expands until it almost fills the entire sample area .",
    "according to this expression , at @xmath77=5  mt , for example , @xmath78  @xmath17 and the effective area of the normal core for the full square structure is @xmath79  3.3  @xmath80 .",
    "this value is in agreement with the observed magnetic period @xmath81 .",
    "the amplitude of the experimental oscillations is higher than expected from the theory ( which was observed also in ref.@xcite ) ( see fig .",
    "[ atpfig2]a ) .",
    "we carried out a few @xmath0 measurements , where we fixed the electronic feedback circuit at a different resistance value ( @xmath82 of the normal state resistance @xmath83 ) . when a higher fixed resistance value was chosen ( @xmath84 of @xmath83 ) , the amplitude of the @xmath0 oscillations",
    "was decreased .",
    "we should mention here that the measured resistance versus temperature curves , as the magnetic field increases , reveal a bump above the normal state resistance , together with a significant broadening of the temperature interval in which the transition takes place . in ref .",
    "@xcite the bump was shown to appear in the superconducting state. since this disturbance is still small at low fields , we believe that the determination of @xmath69 from the low field formula  ( eq .  ( [ lowfield ] ) ) is rather accurate and therefore we use @xmath69=92  nm further on in this paper .",
    "the resistance peaks are caused by the electrical leads attached to the square , which have a higher transition temperature .",
    "for this reason , normal / superconducting boundaries are created at @xmath85 , which , as in the experiment of park _",
    "et al._@xcite , can give rise to a resistive transition showing a peak .",
    "now , we will analyze the phase boundary observed for the 4-antidot structure ( fig .",
    "[ atpfig2]b ) .",
    "it shows similarities with the full square : there is a quasi - linear background with pseudoperiodic oscillations at high fields and the @xmath0 is parabolic for low magnetic fields ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ atpfig2]b ) . at the same time new features ( extra peaks ) are clearly seen below @xmath792.5  mt .    let us first discuss the @xmath0 curve in this low field regime .",
    "we will compare it with the @xmath0 calculated for a @xmath86-cell network consisting of one - dimensional strips .",
    "strictly speaking , the theory for networks is valid only when the width of the strips forming the structure are much smaller than @xmath4 .",
    "for the dimensions of the sample studied here , variations of @xmath50 along the strip width can be expected if @xmath14 is slightly below @xmath87 .",
    "the de gennes - alexander ( dga ) model@xcite , based on the linearized ginzburg - landau equations , has been used successfully to explain the phase boundaries obtained in mesoscopic single- and multiloop structures@xcite with narrow superconducting strips .",
    "the depression of @xmath0 can be expressed as the sum of a topology dependent oscillatory component and a parabolic term ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ atpfig2]b ) which is due to the finite width @xmath88 of the strips : @xmath89    in fig .",
    "[ atpfig4 ] we compare the low magnetic field part of the experimental @xmath0 , where a parabolic background ( eq .  ( [ parabol ] ) ) with an averaged ( over inner and outer strips )",
    "width of 0.4  @xmath17 has been subtracted , with the @xmath0 obtained from the dga  model . in ref.@xcite ( eqs .",
    "20 - 22 ) and ref.@xcite ( eq .  3.12 ) the functions forming the @xmath0 for a @xmath90-cell network can be found .",
    "the field corresponding to one flux quantum per elementary cell is 2.8  mt , leading to an effective total area for the @xmath91-cell network of 2.96  @xmath19 ( 0.74  @xmath19 per cell , the side length of each cell @xmath16=0.86  @xmath17 ) .",
    "the theoretical @xmath0 reproduce the observed flux ( or fluxoid ) states , and have been calculated with @xmath92=92  nm ( dashed line in fig .  [ atpfig4 ] ) , obtained for the full square , and with @xmath69=140  nm ( solid line in fig .  [ atpfig4 ] ) , estimated from the parabolic background ( eq .  ( [ parabol ] ) ) .",
    "it is clear that , for increasing magnetic field , the @xmath0 of the 4-antidot structure can no longer be calculated from the dga  model , since @xmath4 becomes comparable to the width of the strips , giving rise to spatial variation of @xmath50 perpendicular to the strips .",
    "let us point out the differences between the @xmath0 of the present 4-antidot structure and the previously measured @xmath93-antidot cluster made of pb / cu @xcite . in the present al structure ,",
    "the network features are not periodically repeated as the magnetic field is increased . instead , above 2.8  mt",
    ", the positions of the successive peaks coincide with the peaks observed in the @xmath0 of the reference full square .",
    "moreover , the background clearly starts deviating from parabolic to quasi - linear .",
    "contrary to this , in the pb / cu antidot cluster ( see fig .  1 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) the peaks related to the network behavior are visible over two periods , i.e. up to @xmath94  5  mt . for higher fields ,",
    "no giant vortex state can be deduced for the pb / cu sample , since the background reduction of @xmath6 stays parabolic and @xmath0 shows pronounced peaks instead of cusps .",
    "the main parameter which determines the @xmath0 is the coherence length @xmath4 .",
    "since the coherence length @xmath69 of al is approximately three times larger than for pb / cu , the relative @xmath6 reduction @xmath95 is almost a factor 10 higher in al than in an identical pb / cu sample ( see eqs .",
    "( [ xitopb])-([parabol ] ) ) .",
    "since , for a particular sample geometry , @xmath96 should only depend on the magnetic field ( at @xmath97 ) , the penetration depth @xmath5 might play an important role .",
    "using @xmath98 , with @xmath99=140  nm for al , and @xmath99=76  nm for pb / cu @xcite , we obtain @xmath100 .",
    "in other words , the assumption @xmath32 ( corresponding to @xmath101 ) is fulfilled up to higher magnetic fields in the case of pb / cu .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that , the peaks due to switching of the state of single antidots , is seen up to higher fields in pb / cu , but it does not explain the very different behavior in the two materials of course .",
    "other possibilities might be related to the proximity effect in pb / cu , as well as to a different saturation number @xcite @xmath102 in the two materials , although the simple formula for @xmath103 was obtained only for a single antidot surrounded by a large superconducting area and might not be valid here .    for the ( slightly larger ) 2-antidot al structure ( fig .",
    "[ atpfig2]c ) the interpretation of the low field regime of @xmath0 is more difficult .",
    "we will return briefly to this point later in the paper . at high fields , however , the positions of the peaks in @xmath0 correspond to the same pseudoperiodic oscillations as for the full square and 4-antidot structure .    in fig .",
    "[ atpfig3 ] we have replotted the phase diagram in units of @xmath104 .",
    "it is important to note that we defined the flux as @xmath105 , with @xmath106 the effective area of the whole microsquare .",
    "it is close to the exact outer sample area @xmath107 , and was introduced in order to fit the peak positions to the calculated @xmath38 for a circular dot . to avoid confusion ,",
    "we want to mention the different definition of flux in refs .",
    "@xcite ( antidot cluster ) , where flux is referred to the area available for one single antidot . in the case of a loop @xcite , it is natural to define the flux as the area enclosed by a contour through the middle of the strips multiplied by the magnetic field , in order to ensure a perfectly periodic @xmath38 , with a period @xmath15 .",
    "since the 2-antidot structure is a bit larger than the two other structures , a different @xmath65 is used to scale the magnetic field . in the inset the positions of the peaks in the experimental @xmath108 are compared with the theoretical prediction for a mesoscopic superconducting disk .",
    "the @xmath35-th peak corresponds to the transition between the state @xmath109 and @xmath110 ( for the 4-antidot sample the peak numbers have been reassigned due to the extra peaks in the network regime ) . at high magnetic fields",
    ", there is a quite good agreement of the peak positions of the three structures and a good correspondence with the theoretical values found for the disk , which is drawn in the inset of fig .",
    "[ atpfig3 ] as a solid line .",
    "how can we understand this striking coincidence of the peak positions at high fields for the three structures ?",
    "for this , we have to look how the superconducting order parameter nucleates along a curved superconductor / insulator boundary .",
    "figure  [ atpfig5]a shows the calculated @xmath38 curves for a single circular dot and for an antidot ( see also ref.@xcite ) in an infinite film , both of radius @xmath37 .",
    "the latter has been calculated in a similar way as the @xmath38 of the dot . for a single antidot , the boundary condition ( eq .  ( [ boundaryconditions ] ) )",
    "translates into : @xmath111 where the function @xmath112 is the kummer function of the second kind , diverging at the origin , i.e. at the center of the antidot .",

    "( [ xitopb ] ) , to obtain the @xmath38 .    in figure  [ atpfig5]b the respective enhancement factors @xmath113 ( corresponding to @xmath57 ) are shown .",
    "for both the dot and the antidot the value @xmath113=1.69 is approached as the curvature radius @xmath37 goes to infinity ( or for a fixed @xmath37 , as @xmath114 ) .",
    "since the dot has a larger @xmath113 than the antidot , corresponding to a higher @xmath45 , the superconducting order parameter is expected to grow initially at the outer sample boundary , as the temperature drops below @xmath6 . at slightly lower temperatures",
    "surface superconductivity should as well nucleate around the antidots . in the mean time , however , the order parameter has reached already a finite value over the whole width of the strips . in the complete temperature ( or flux ) interval of our measurements @xmath115 for the antidots and @xmath116 for the dot ( when scaling the radii to the actual sample dimensions ) .",
    "the resistively measured phase transitions , probably because of this substantially different @xmath13 for a dot and an antidot , only show peaks related to the switching of the angular momentum @xmath9 , associated with a closed contour along the outer sample boundary . at the @xmath0 boundary , in the high magnetic field regime",
    ", there is no such closed superconducting path around each single antidot , and therefore the fluxoid quantization condition does not need to be fulfilled for a closed contour encircling each single antidot .",

    "the discrepancy between these two results still has to be clarified .",
    "for the 2-antidot structure , further quantitative calculations are needed to describe the low field behavior .",
    "since there are no extra peaks present in @xmath38 , compared to the full square , we believe that , here as well , a surface superconducting sheath develops along the outer sample boundary . at the lowest fields , the sheath width @xmath127 is still larger than the width @xmath88 of the strips , and therefore the position of the first peaks ( mainly the second ) in @xmath38 are different from the full square .    in fig .",

    "another clear example of a similar behavior is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath0 of the ( square ) dot is shown to be lower than the @xmath0 of a the loop , when exposed to a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "this general rule applies , for instance , also to simple strips for which @xmath0 is suppressed more when the width @xmath88 increases , which is described by eq .",
    "( [ parabol ] ) . in the dot of ref .",
    "@xcite , the giant vortex state was shown to develop .",
    "for the loop studied in that paper @xcite , however , the used magnetic fields were too low to induce the crossover to a giant vortex state , which contrasts the observations from the present paper , in the high magnetic field regime .",
    "the appearance of the giant vortex state in the high field regime is the most plausible explanation at the moment .",
    "we can not exclude , however , that another scenario is also possible .",
    "namely , a nearly flat non - zero distribution of @xmath133 in the sample interior could coexist with an enhanced @xmath134 at the external sample boundary , although we believe that such a situation would give rise to peaks in @xmath38 each time an antidot changes its quantum state . in any case",
    ", the final description of the specific shape of the superconducting order parameter at @xmath38 requires a numerical two - dimensional calculation of @xmath50 for the perforated topologies , where the boundary conditions are fulfilled both at the outer and at antidot superconducting / insulator interfaces .    in summary",
    ", we have presented the experimental superconducting / normal phase boundaries @xmath0 of a mesoscopic full square and two perforated mesoscopic aluminum squares .",
    "the flux interval was divided in two regimes by comparing the results with the behavior of a full square microstructure : for low magnetic fields the 4-antidot structure behaves like a network consisting of quasi - one - dimensional strips , giving rise to extra peaks in @xmath0 in comparison to the full square . in the 2-antidot structure",
    "the peak positions are only shifted compared to the full square .",
    "as soon as each antidot contains one flux quantum , the giant vortex develops , resulting in pseudoperiodic oscillations in the @xmath0 and a quasi - linear background on @xmath0 at high magnetic fields . in this regime ,",
    "the peak positions coincide for all three structures studied when the phase boundaries are plotted in flux quanta units ( where flux is referred to the total sample area ) . for high magnetic fields ,",
    "the presence of the antidots apparently does not change the phase winding number @xmath9 for a closed contour around the outer perimeter of the whole square . since the enhancement factor @xmath57 is the highest at the outer sample boundary , superconductivity nucleates initially near the outside sample edges , resulting in a giant vortex state .",
