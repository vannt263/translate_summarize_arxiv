    "over the years , numerous observational and theoretical studies have shown that nearly all stars lose mass in the form of stellar winds .",
    "although the details associated with the wind formation can be quite different from one star to another , and could involve a number of different physical processes , the most common driving force is the stellar radiation field .",
    "in fact , the radiation alone can be responsible for driving the stellar wind as the photons are absorbed or scattered by the outflowing material .",
    "in cool stars , where the conditions in the wind permit dust to form , the photons are absorbed by the dust particles , while in hotter stars the photon momentum is transferred to the wind by excitation of the atomic gas , resulting in what is known as line - driven wind .    among the b - type stars , which have effective temperatures in the range of 10,000 to 30,000  k , there exists a very interesting class of stars that possess circumstellar regions with much higher densities than expected for line - driven winds of stars of similar effective temperatures and masses .",
    "these stars are known as be stars and their common characteristic is that they have , or had in the past , at least one balmer line in emission .",
    "typically , the be notation is reserved for non - supergiant b - type stars with line - emitting circumstellar material .",
    "it is sometimes necessary to emphasize the difference between be stars with circumstellar envelopes that are thought to be formed by an outflowing material and b - type stars with circumstellar regions that are formed by accretion of the surrounding material , as in the case of herbig  ae / be stars , or semi - detached  ( algol type ) binary systems . in such case , the term `` classical be star '' is used to explicitly identify non - accreting b - type stars with circumstellar regions  ( see also the review paper by * ? ? ?",
    "the initial attempts to apply optical interferometry to be stars have been quite promising .",
    "@xcite were the first to spatially resolve the the circumstellar envelope of a be star ( @xmath3  cas ) using the i2 t interferometer .",
    "shortly thereafter , the mark  iii interferometer was used to obtain the first direct measurements of the deviation from spherical symmetry of the h@xmath0-emitting regions of @xmath3  cas and @xmath4  tau  @xcite .",
    "interferometric observations that divide the h@xmath0 emission line into a number of spectral channels have also been obtained with the gi2 t interferometer , and they resulted in the first detection of a rotational signature in an envelope of a be star  @xcite .",
    "the combination of linear polarization studies with interferometric observations of a number of be stars , which have shown that the h@xmath0-emitting envelopes are flattened , is the strongest observational evidence to date for the presence of relatively thin circumstellar disks  @xcite .",
    "the recent interferometric detection of a high degree of oblateness of the stellar photosphere in the be star @xmath0  eridani by  @xcite , compounded with the possibility that most @xmath5 values for be stars could be significantly underestimated  @xcite , has reignited the interest in the connection between the stellar rotation and the be disk formation mechanisms .",
    "similarly , the study of the correlation between the strength of the h@xmath0 emission line and the spatial extent of the emitting region of a be star can be used to establish the properties of the circumstellar region .",
    "although @xcite have shown that there is a tendency for stars with larger disks to have stronger h@xmath0 emission , there was also a considerable scatter present in their results",
    ". we will extend their analysis to account for the different base flux levels in the h@xmath0 emission lines , and we will show that there is a clear relationship between the net emission and the physical extent of the h@xmath0-emitting disk .",
    "the new observations that we present in this paper , as well as those that were reported previously  @xcite , were all obtained with the navy prototype optical interferometer  ( npoi ) .",
    "the instrument is a descendant of the mark  i through mark  iii phase - tracking optical interferometers  @xcite and is located at the dark observing site of the lowell observatory , near flagstaff , arizona .",
    "we will review here only those aspects of the instrument and the observational setup that are directly relevant to the work presented in this paper . for a more detailed discussion of the instrument , the initial data reduction process , and the calibration ,",
    "the reader is referred to the papers by  @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the npoi consists of an imaging and an astrometric array , but for all the npoi observations discussed in this paper only three astrometric stations located in the inner part of the array were used  ( also referred to as the ac0 , ae0 , and aw0 stations ; * ? ? ?",
    "the three baselines formed by the ac0ae0aw0 triangle are shown in figure  [ fig : npoi_model_sub ] with dotted lines .",
    "each pair of elements creates an interference pattern at the beam combiner , which is then dispersed by a prism onto a lenslet array .",
    "a series of optical fibers that are glued to the back of each of the three lenslet arrays carry the signal to a cluster of photon - counting avalanche photodiodes  ( apds ) , which record the intensity variations as a function of a variable optical path difference .",
    "each lenslet array provides 32  spectral channels covering the 450850  nm spectral region .",
    "however , because the number of available apds was limited at the time of observations , as well as the signal - to - noise ratio  ( snr ) was too low in some channels  ( especially those at shorter wavelengths where the sensitivity of the instrument is low ) , not all spectral channels were usable . also , the spectral alignment of the lenslet arrays was such that the h@xmath0 emission was located in one of two spectral channels depending on the baseline  ( i.e. , depending which lenslet array detected the signal for that baseline ) .",
    "these two channels are labeled with central wavelengths of 648 and 665  nm , but because both of these channels have approximately the same spectral width of 16  nm , the ones that contain the h@xmath0 emission line are referred to as the h@xmath0 channels  ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* where the alignment of the spectral channels is described in detail ) .",
    "we obtain an estimate of squared visibility for every 2  ms data frame , and these values are then incoherently averaged over 1  s intervals to create 1  s data points  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details ) .",
    "in a subsequent step a raw squared visibility that corresponds to a 90  s interval  ( known also as a `` scan '' ) is calculated by a simple average . in the process , the observational errors of the raw scans are set equal to the standard deviation of the 1  s data points divided by the square root of the number of points in a scan .",
    "this approach produces larger errors than one would get by propagating the errors of the individual 1  s data points  @xcite , but it is part of the standard reduction scheme that attempts to account for both the white and the non - white noise sources  ( i.e. , it attempts to account for some of the atmospheric and instrumental effects ) . if some of these effects are removed from the data through subsequent calibration  ( like the one we developed in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these error bars will tend to overestimate the magnitude of the actual observational uncertainties .",
    "new methods for estimating the interferometric observables along with their associated uncertainties are currently being developed by the npoi team , but their discussion is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the be stars @xmath1  tauri  ( = hr  1165 ) and @xmath2  canis  minoris  ( = hr  2845 ) have been observed with the npoi on many occasions , although most of the time not as primary scientific targets . in many instances",
    "they have been used as calibration sources , or check stars for observations of other targets , frequently binary systems .",
    "this resulted in a quite limited coverage of these stars on any single night , but searching through the archival observations of npoi we have found 22 nights from late 1997 to early 1999 that contained at least some valid scans of @xmath1  tau or @xmath2  cmi .",
    "some scans were excluded because of missing data on one of the baselines , or very low snr due to poor atmospheric conditions .",
    "table  [ tab : new_observations ] lists the dates and the number of scans of @xmath1  tau and @xmath2  cmi available for analysis from each of the 22 nights .",
    "we begin by calibrating the @xmath6-values of @xmath1  tau and @xmath2  cmi using exactly the same method as was used in the case of @xmath4  tau  @xcite . for the stellar disk diameters of @xmath1  tau and @xmath2",
    "cmi we adopt the photometrically inferred values of 0.71 and 0.74 , respectively  @xcite . because the instrumental configuration of the npoi was unchanged ,",
    "for all practical purposes , from 1997 until mid-1999 , the spectral alignment of the output beams with respect to the lenslet arrays was the same for all stars observed with the npoi over that period . also , as it was discussed in @xcite , the alignment of the spectral channels was such that the h@xmath0 emission was located in either the 648 or 665  nm channel , depending on the baseline .",
    "we verify if this is also the case for @xmath1  tau and @xmath2  cmi by comparing the signal from the channels that are expected to contain the h@xmath0 signal with those that do not .",
    "the calibrated squared visibilities of @xmath1  tau from the h@xmath0-containing channels are shown in figure  [ fig : model_fit - etau ] along with the @xmath6-values for the uniform disk  ( ud ) model representing the stellar photosphere .",
    "the squared visibilities from the h@xmath0 channels systematically fall below the expected photospheric values , especially at the higher spatial frequencies .",
    "we interpret this as a direct signature of a resolved circumstellar envelope that is responsible for the h@xmath0 emission .",
    "figure  [ fig : nohalpha - etau ] demonstrates that the signature in the 648 and 665  nm channels without the h@xmath0 emission , is very similar to that seen in the continuum channels at both shorter  ( fig .  [ fig:604nm_res - etau ] ) , and longer  ( fig .",
    "[ fig:702nm_res - etau ] ) wavelengths .",
    "although the quantity of data is much smaller in the case of @xmath2  cmi , the same conclusions can be reached by inspecting the signal in the spectral channels with and without the h@xmath0 emission  ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : model_fit - bcmi ] and  [ fig : nohalpha - bcmi ] ) . based on this",
    "we conclude that all of the h@xmath0 emission is captured in one spectral channel at all three baselines for both @xmath1  tau and @xmath2  cmi .",
    "the interferometric observations of be stars represent a unique class of observations , where the star can be modeled with a simple two - component model . at the angular resolution provided by our observations the stellar photosphere , which is visible at the continuum wavelengths ,",
    "can be modeled with the ud model .",
    "the second component , which is responsible for the h@xmath0 emission , can be modeled with an elliptical gaussian to determine the angular extent and the ellipticity of the circumstellar region . if the two components are assumed to be concentric , then the net squared visibility for both components can be expressed as a normalized sum of the form : @xmath7 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where both @xmath8 and @xmath9 are discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10 parameter in the above equation represents the net fractional contribution from the stellar photosphere to the net signal in the h@xmath0 channel , and , because it is defined to have a value between 0 and 1 , it also maintains the normalization of the net visibility . of course ,",
    "if the two components are not concentric then the individual visibility amplitudes can not be added in such a simple way and one would have to account for the relative complex phase shifts between the models . however , because our observations were obtained at a relatively short baselines  ( 18.937.5  m ) , we resolve only the overall shape of the circumstellar regions and we are insensitive to small scale deviations from point - symmetric source structure .    to be consistent with the modeling of the h@xmath0-emitting envelopes of @xmath3  cas and @xmath4  tau  @xcite , we model the envelopes of @xmath1  tau and @xmath2  cmi using gaussian models .",
    "we first fit a circularly symmetric gaussian to the data by keeping the axial ratio , @xmath11 , fixed at unity and the resulting two - parameter fits are listed in table  [ tab : new_parameters ] . as expected , because both stars have a relatively weak h@xmath0 emission , the contribution from the stellar photosphere to the net signal in the h@xmath0 channel is large in both cases  ( roughly 90% ) . the best - fit circularly symmetric gaussian model for @xmath1  tau is shown in figure  [ fig : model_fit - etau ] along with the resulting normalized residuals .",
    "the majority of the data points do not deviate from the model by more than one standard deviation , although the residuals in figure  [ fig : model_fit - etau ]  ( which have a @xmath12 of 1.03 ) show more variation than the residuals calculated from the difference between the ud model and the data in the continuum channels  ( see the residuals in figs .",
    "[ fig : nohalpha - etau ] , [ fig:604nm_res - etau ] , and  [ fig:702nm_res - etau ] which have @xmath12 values of 0.83 , 0.57 , and 0.43 , respectively ) .",
    "likewise the best - fit circularly symmetric gaussian model for @xmath2",
    "cmi is shown in figure  [ fig : model_fit - bcmi ] .",
    "fitting elliptical gaussian models to the squared visibilities from the h@xmath0 channels of @xmath1  tau and @xmath2  cmi yields model parameters with an apparent ellipticity in both cases .",
    "the model parameters are listed in table  [ tab : new_parameters ] along with the corresponding @xmath12 values , which also suggest that the elliptical gaussian models result in a slightly better fits .",
    "unfortunately , we can not confidently rule out the possibility that the apparent ellipticity is a result of systematic errors that could be present in our data  ( for example due to insufficient bias level corrections ) .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that @xcite , who observed @xmath1  tau and @xmath2  cmi with the mark  iii interferometer  ( and thus were influenced by different systematic errors ) , reported similar model parameters for both stars .",
    "the modeling presented in this paper and @xcite has resulted in properties of h@xmath0-emitting envelopes for a total of four be stars that have been observed with the npoi . because we model each h@xmath0-emitting envelope in nearly the same way as  @xcite",
    ", we can also include their results for three extra be stars to increase the sample size .",
    "table  [ tab : be_star_sizes ] lists the names and the spectral types  ( from the bright star catalogue , bsc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the be stars observed with the npoi , along with those that have model parameters based on the work of  @xcite , at the bottom of the list .",
    "we see from the table that we have a range of spectral types , and thus it should be possible to investigate not only the relationship between the h@xmath0 emission and the physical extent of the emitting region , but also to test for any obvious dependencies on spectral type .",
    "we begin by discussing the sources of the observational parameters derived from both interferometric and spectroscopic observations of each star .    for the be stars @xmath3  cas , @xmath1  tau ,",
    "@xmath4  tau , and @xmath2  cmi , best - fit model parameters describing an elliptical gaussian model have been presented in @xcite and   [ sec : models ] .",
    "the model parameters that are relevant to our discussion are the angular size of the major axis  ( @xmath13 ) and the ratio of the minor to major axis  ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "@xcite also obtained the same model parameters for @xmath14  per , @xmath15  per , and 48  per and therefore in table  [ tab : be_star_sizes ] we adopt their parameters for these stars .",
    "the radiation from the circumstellar disk of a be star can be characterized by the equivalent width  ( ew ) of the h@xmath0 emission line .",
    "unfortunately , our interferometric observations do not contain this type of detailed spectroscopic information , and thus we need to rely on independently obtained spectroscopic observations . for",
    "be stars that are known to possess h@xmath0 emission that is stable on long time scales , it is not necessary to obtain spectra that cover the same time - frame as the interferometric observations . on the other hand , for stars whose variability is well documented , spectroscopic observations taken as close in time as possible to the interferometric observations are required .",
    "we have searched the literature for spectroscopic information on the h@xmath0 emission that would cover the same period as our interferometric observations , which were acquired between 1997 and 1999 , and those of @xcite , which were obtained throughout 1992 .    to check for consistency and long - term stability of the h@xmath0 emission of the targets observed with the npoi ,",
    "we have obtained echelle spectra of @xmath3  cas and @xmath4  tau on 2003  december  9 , and @xmath1  tau and @xmath2  cmi on 2004  march  8 .",
    "the echelle spectra were obtained using the lowell observatory s solar - stellar spectrograph  ( sss ) located at the same site as the npoi .",
    "the sss instrument and the idl - based reduction package that was used to extract the spectra from the raw echelle orders were described by  @xcite .",
    "the resulting spectra of the h@xmath0 region , shown in figure  [ fig : halpha_4plots ] , have a resolving power of about 30,000 and snr in the range of 150200 at the continuum wavelengths , and higher at the emission line .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission profiles of @xmath1  tau and @xmath2  cmi are presented in the literature for a number of different epochs . by inspecting the profiles obtained by various observers between 1980 and 1999  @xcite , as well as the profiles from 2004 shown in figure  [ fig : halpha_4plots ] ,",
    "we conclude that the overall emission remained largely unchanged for both stars over the period covered by the observations .",
    "this is true not only for the relative shape of the line but also the width and the peak intensity .",
    "the only exception are the observations reported by @xcite , where the emission appears higher above the continuum ( by @xmath1610 and @xmath1630  % for @xmath2  cmi and @xmath1  tau , respectively ) than in all other references .",
    "because @xcite have a spectral coverage of approximately 2.5  nm centered on h@xmath0 , which is narrower than the full extent of the underlying absorption line , their h@xmath0 profiles are susceptible to incorrect normalization of the continuum level when the absorption line is not completely filled in ( as is the case in @xmath1  tau and @xmath2  cmi ) . treating the extended wings of the absorption component as the continuum level will then result in an overestimation of the peak intensity of the emission component .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the h@xmath0 profiles of @xmath1  tau and @xmath2  cmi do not change significantly on long time scales and for these two stars we use the equivalent widths of the emission lines observed in 2004 , shown in figure  [ fig : halpha_4plots ] .      both @xmath3  cas and @xmath4  tau are known to show complex variations in their h@xmath0 emission profiles on time scales from months to years , but in both cases the variations on the longer time scales are always more significant . furthermore , because the ew measure is an integrated quantity , it has the tendency to be insensitive to the small - scale variations in the line profile , typically seen at the shortest time scales . therefore we are only interested in the changes in the ew of h@xmath0 on the time scales of years .    in the case of @xmath3  cas the spectroscopic observations conducted by  @xcite are the closest in time to our interferometric observations that were obtained between 1997 and 1998  @xcite .",
    "@xcite reports h@xmath0 ew of @xmath17  nm at the end of 1998 , and @xmath18  nm for observations obtained a year later . by comparing the above values with the ew of @xmath19  nm",
    "that we obtain for the h@xmath0 profile of @xmath3  cas from 2003  ( recall fig .",
    "[ fig : halpha_4plots ] ) , we conclude that variability in the ew at the @xmath1620% level , on time scale of a year , can be expected .",
    "however , because the observations of @xcite from 1998 were acquired only one month after our 1998 interferometric observations , we use their reported ew of h@xmath0 as the corresponding emission measure for our observations .",
    "the interferometric observations of @xmath4  tau that we have analyzed in @xcite were obtained on 1999  march  1 . once again , the h@xmath0 observations by @xcite conducted on 1999  march  16 are the closest in time to our observations . because the h@xmath0 profile variations on time scales of days are very small in @xmath4  tau  @xcite ,",
    "the ew of @xmath20  nm reported by @xcite is suitable for our analysis .",
    "it is also interesting to note that this value is effectively the same as the ew of @xmath21  nm we obtain for the profile shown in figure  [ fig : halpha_4plots ] .",
    "we should also note that in the case of @xmath3  cas and @xmath4  tau the h@xmath0 emission completely fills in the underlying absorption component and therefore the normalization of the continuum in these stars is less susceptible to errors , like the ones discussed in the previous section .      by comparing the h@xmath0 profiles of @xmath14  per , @xmath15  per , and 48  per from 1980  @xcite , 1989  @xcite , 1993  @xcite , and 19982000  @xcite , we conclude that only @xmath14  per has significantly varying h@xmath0 emission , but even in that case the main variation is a gradual weakening of the emission over many years .",
    "since the mark  iii observations of the above stars date back to 1992 , we use the ew of h@xmath0 reported by  @xcite , who observed these stars in 1993 .",
    "the three stars , @xmath14  per , @xmath15  per , and 48  per , have shown equivalent widths of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24  nm , respectively .",
    "because distance has a direct effect on angular size , the angular measurements of the major axes of the circumstellar regions must be either transformed into physical sizes  ( if the distances are known ) or normalized with respect to the angular diameters of the central stars  ( which must be estimated since they have not been measured directly ) .",
    "the latter method was used by @xcite , and , although it does eliminate the dependence on distance , it introduces a dependence on the size of the central star . because we have a range of spectral types , this approach is not optimal .",
    "a much better approach is to use the known distances to obtain directly the physical extent of each region .",
    "we use the observed hipparcos parallax  ( @xmath25 ) to derive the corresponding distance  ( @xmath26 ) to each star .",
    "this in turn allows us to convert the best - fit value for the angular size of the major axis of the elliptical gaussian model into a corresponding size in meters .",
    "table  [ tab : be_star_sizes ] lists the angular size of the major axis  ( @xmath13 ) of each h@xmath0-emitting region and the corresponding physical size in meters  ( @xmath27 ) , along with the hipparcos data used to calculate the distance to each star .",
    "the equivalent widths of the h@xmath0 emission lines typically reported in the literature only measure the amount of emission above the continuum level . because b - type stars possess significant h@xmath0 absorption profiles , we need to correct for the `` filling - in '' effect of the absorption line to recover the total amount of emission . in our approach",
    "we assume that the entire absorption line is filled in by the superimposed emission .",
    "this is a good approximation for the sources considered here , where the h@xmath0 emission lines are stronger and wider than the underlying absorption lines . even in the case of @xmath1  tau and @xmath2",
    "cmi , where the absorption lines are not completely filled in  ( recall fig .  [ fig : halpha_4plots ] ) , the above assumption can still be applied , because our ew measures of the emission are already reduced by the amount the absorption line is not filled in .    to obtain an estimate on the ew of the absorption line , we follow the procedure developed by  @xcite , who modeled the relationship between the ew of the h@xmath0 absorption line and the intrinsic @xmath28 color index for normal main sequence b - type stars .",
    "this can be done because in b - type stars the strength of the h@xmath0 absorption line increases monotonically with spectral type to a maximum at type a0 .",
    "we should also note that for stars in our sample that are not on the main sequence , the equivalent widths of the absorption lines derived using the above method will be slightly overestimated  ( by not more than 0.1  nm ) . because this is at the same level as the intrinsic scatter observed in the h@xmath0 equivalent widths for stars of the same spectral type  ( see , for example , fig",
    ".  1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we neglect this overestimation in our analysis .    in table",
    "[ tab : be_star_mag ] we list the observed @xmath29 colors from the bsc for each of the stars . deriving the intrinsic @xmath28 color of the central star from the observed @xmath29 value is not trivial , even if the corrections for the interstellar extinction are known , because be stars can still appear intrinsically redder than normal b - type stars of the same spectral type .",
    "this is typically attributed to free - bound and free - free emission , as well as a possible circumstellar reddening  @xcite .",
    "for this reason we estimate the @xmath28 index based on the spectral type and not on the observed @xmath29 color .",
    "table  [ tab : be_star_mag ] lists the @xmath28 values based on the tabulation of  @xcite which in turn is used to calculate the equivalent widths of the h@xmath0 absorption lines  ( via eq .",
    "6 of * ? ? ?",
    "these values are then combined with the equivalent widths of the observed h@xmath0 emission lines  ( @xmath30 ) to give a measure of the net h@xmath0 emission  ( @xmath31 ) from each circumstellar region  ( both quantities are listed in table  [ tab : be_star_emission ] ) .      the net h@xmath0 emission derived in previous section ,",
    "although corrected for the `` filling - in '' effect of the absorption line , is still measured with respect to the underlying stellar continuum .",
    "because we are dealing with spectral classes ranging from b0 to b8 , we need to account for the different continuum flux levels .",
    "we use two independent methods to estimate the stellar continuum level .",
    "one method is based on the photometry and thus requires us to account for the different distances to the sources .",
    "the other method , which is distance independent , uses model energy distributions to represent the underlying stellar continuum .",
    "because the second method does not account for the continuum emission from the circumstellar region , as well as requires an estimate of the stellar radius , it is only used to verify the photometrically derived results .      obtaining the flux levels of the individual stars from photometry",
    "is complicated by the interstellar extinction . using the observed @xmath29 color and the estimated intrinsic @xmath28 color based on the spectral type , we can derive the color excess @xmath32 .",
    "this approach should work for the later type be stars , but will tend to overestimate the color excess  ( by possibly as much as 0.15  mag ) for spectral types b3e and earlier , because of the intrinsic reddening due to the free - bound and free - free emission from the circumstellar envelope  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , there are other methods that can be used to estimate the color excess due to the interstellar extinction . for example",
    ", @xcite used the depth of the interstellar absorption bump at 2200    to derive the values of @xmath32 for a number of be stars and in table  [ tab : be_star_mag ] we list their values of @xmath32 for all but two of our stars .",
    "the two missing be stars are @xmath1  tau and @xmath2  cmi , and because these stars have the latest spectral type , as well as being the closest , we simply derive an estimate of @xmath32 based on their observed @xmath29 colors and the intrinsic @xmath28 colors derived from the spectral type .    with a known color excess @xmath32",
    "we can correct the apparent @xmath33 magnitude of each star for interstellar extinction using : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the reddening constant , defined as @xmath36 .",
    "the typical value of @xmath35 found by  @xcite is 3.14@xmath370.10 .",
    "similarly , the observed @xmath38 colors  ( see table  [ tab : be_star_mag ] ) can be corrected for interstellar reddening using the ratio of @xmath39 derived by  @xcite , and in turn the @xmath40 magnitudes can be obtained .",
    "the @xmath41-band has an effective central wavelength of @xmath16658  nm and a fwhm of @xmath16138  nm , and thus @xmath40 magnitude can be used to measure the continuum flux level in the h@xmath0 region .",
    "also , the relatively large spectral width of the @xmath41-band allows us to neglect the contribution of the h@xmath0 emission to @xmath40 .    to convert a @xmath40 magnitude into a corresponding flux above earth s atmosphere  ( @xmath42 ) we use @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the mean flux density  ( in the @xmath41-band ) and the @xmath41 magnitude of a standard star , respectively . because we are interested in the functional dependence of the net h@xmath0 emission on the disk size , the actual value of @xmath44 is not important . nevertheless , in order to work with values that have physically meaningful units we use a _ representative _ value for the absolute flux density of @xmath46  w  m@xmath47nm@xmath48 defined for a standard star with @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "the values for @xmath42 based on the @xmath40 magnitudes are listed in table  [ tab : be_star_lum ] , along with the corresponding _ total _ radiation at h@xmath0  ( @xmath50 ) .    finally to work with an h@xmath0 emission measure that is independent of distance we multiply the net h@xmath0 emission , @xmath31 , derived in previous section , by the total radiation in the h@xmath0 region , to obtain @xmath51 which we refer to as the h@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "the values for the h@xmath0 luminosities are given in table  [ tab : be_star_emission ] along with their corresponding uncertainties , which account for the errors in the distance determination  ( largest source of uncertainty ) , photometry , and the h@xmath0 equivalent widths , but do not include the uncertainty associated with the determination of the absolute flux density of a standard star .",
    "instead of using photometry to derive the stellar continuum flux level in the h@xmath0 region , we can use synthetic spectra calculated for atmospheric models of varying effective temperatures . for this purpose",
    "we have used the well known grid of stellar atmosphere model spectra computed using the atlas9 program  @xcite .",
    "the models were chosen to have effective temperatures that were the same as , or as close to those estimated based on the spectral type  ( see table  [ tab : be_star_lum ] ) . because the grid covered the range of the effective temperatures in approximately 500 and 1,000  k steps , for some stars it was necessary to interpolate the fluxes in effective temperature .",
    "all models correspond to solar abundances , @xmath52 of 4  ( for luminosity class v or iv ) and 3.5  ( for luminosity class of iii ) , although little variation between the two gravities is present , and the standard microturbulence of 2  km  s@xmath48 was used .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec_12000k ] illustrates a sample of the physical flux  ( @xmath53 ) as a function of wavelength obtained for a 12,000  k model .    to estimate the total stellar radiation from the physical flux in the h@xmath0 region we need to account for the surface area of each star .",
    "we estimate the radius of each star based on its spectral type  @xcite , and the resulting synthetic total radiation in the h@xmath0 region  ( @xmath54 ) is given in table  [ tab : be_star_lum ] .",
    "it is evident from the table that the synthetic values are systematically smaller than the photometrically derived ones , and this should be expected because the synthetic spectra do not account for the bound - free and free - free emission from the circumstellar material . although there does exist a general correlation between the net h@xmath0 emission and ir excess , a large intrinsic scatter is also observed between different sources , and therefore it is not trivial to account for this extra emission  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the continuum level can be affected by the stellar rotation , especially when the star is rotating close to its critical velocity  @xcite .",
    "the assigned spectral type might not account fully for such deviation from the continuum level that would be observed in the case of a non - rapidly rotating star of the same spectral type .",
    "nevertheless , because we are only interested in the synthetic continuum level as a check for the photometrically derived values , we neglect the contribution to the continuum level from the circumstellar region and any possible changes due to the stellar rotation .",
    "taking the same approach as in equation  ( [ eqn : halpha_lum ] ) we can calculate a synthetic h@xmath0 luminosity using @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the net h@xmath0 emission discussed in   [ sec : net_halpha ] .",
    "the @xmath57 values for all seven stars are listed in table  [ tab : be_star_emission ] .",
    "we begin by looking at the relationship between the h@xmath0 emission and the physical extent of the circumstellar region .",
    "using the values for the h@xmath0 luminosity from table  [ tab : be_star_emission ] and the physical size of the major axis from table  [ tab : be_star_sizes ] , we construct a corresponding log - log plot of @xmath58 versus @xmath27 in figure  [ fig : halpha_lum ] .",
    "we obtain a pearson correlation coefficient of 0.98 and thus a definite correlation between the parameters exists . fitting a line to the data in the log - log plot",
    "yields a slope of 2.12@xmath370.24 and a @xmath12 of 0.75 .",
    "the above result suggests that the emission is proportional to the area of the h@xmath0-emitting region independently of the different inclination angles at which these systems are viewed  ( although the range of possible inclination angles represented by our small sample of stars is not that large ) .",
    "if the circumstellar region is optically thin to h@xmath0 emission then this might simply mean that the _ _ emission measure _ _ emission is created by recombinations , the total emission in the optically thin case is proportional to the volume integrated squared electron number density , i.e. @xmath59 , which is also known as the emission measure  ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    ". ] of the disk , which is proportional to the emitting volume , scales as the surface area of the emitting region .",
    "however , the study of energetics of be star envelopes by  @xcite shows that the h@xmath0 emission originating in the equatorial plane of the circumstellar disk , especially close to the central star  ( for @xmath60 ) , is optically thick . because this is the same region that is responsible for the majority of the line emission , and",
    "if the disk has a constant surface brightness , then the h@xmath0 luminosity might be expected to be proportional to the effective surface area of the circumstellar disk .",
    "if we assume that the circumstellar region is a geometrically thin axisymmetric disk , then the axial ratio , @xmath11 , we have obtained from the elliptical gaussian model can be used to estimate the inclination angle @xmath61 between the direction perpendicular to the plane of the disk and the line of sight  ( i.e. , @xmath62 ) . because the effective area of a disk viewed at an angle @xmath61 can be expressed as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the surface area , and if the h@xmath0 luminosity is proportional to the effective area , dividing @xmath58 by @xmath11 should remove any dependence on the inclination angle .",
    "figure  [ fig : all_be_stars ] shows the relationship between @xmath65 and @xmath27 where again the correlation coefficient is high  ( 0.96 ) and the best - fit line has a slope of 2.24@xmath370.26 and @xmath12 of 1.19 . based on this result we conclude that the h@xmath0 luminosity ( corrected for the projection effect ) is consistent with an optically thick emission from a geometrically thin disk of a relatively constant surface brightness .",
    "optically thick disks with no temperature gradients will have a constant surface brightness as a function of radius .",
    "although actual disks will have a range of temperatures , assigning a constant temperature to the h@xmath0-emitting region might be appropriate .",
    "this is because  @xcite , who , by considering the rates of energy gain and loss in the disks of four be stars  ( including @xmath3  cas , @xmath15  per , and @xmath2  cmi ) , have shown that the disk temperature in the equatorial plane is fairly constant as a function of radial distance , especially in the regions close to the central star  ( i.e. , where the majority of the h@xmath0 flux is expected to originate ) .",
    "furthermore , our results suggest that the surface brightness in the h@xmath0-emitting region is not only constant as a function of radial distance , but that it does not vary significantly for stars of different effective temperatures .",
    "this is somewhat surprising , considering that the disk models of @xcite for stars of different effective temperatures do not have the same temperature profiles as function of radial distance , although in the inner part of the disks  ( @xmath66 ) the temperature differences are not that large and are in the 3,0005,000  k range  ( depending on the distance from the equatorial plane ) .",
    "it is also possible that because the h@xmath0 emission is optically thick in these inner regions  @xcite , the similar surface brightnesses for disks with slightly different temperatures is a result of similar conditions in the envelopes where the optical depth is roughly unity  ( i.e. , where most of the radiation originates ) .",
    "lastly , we need to verify that the visible trend in figure  [ fig : halpha_lum ]  ( as well as fig .  [",
    "fig : all_be_stars ] ) is not a result of the functional dependence of @xmath27 and @xmath58 on the same determination of distance @xmath26 , which by itself will tend to introduce correlation between the two parameters . to verify that the correlations are not caused by the dependence on @xmath26 alone",
    ", we use the synthetic h@xmath0 luminosities  ( recall   [ sec : synthetic ] ) , which are measured with respect to the synthetic continuum levels and thus are independent of @xmath26 , and we analyze the relationships between @xmath67 and @xmath68 versus @xmath27 in figures  [ fig : new_hvsd ] and [ fig : new_hvsd_w_r ] , respectively . because only the abscissa depends on the distance in this case , a trend can no longer be caused by the functional dependence on distance .",
    "these relations yield best - fit slopes of 1.98@xmath370.33 and 2.28@xmath370.38  ( and correlation coefficients of 0.91 and 0.96 ) , in complete agreement with our previously determined values .",
    "the @xmath12 values for the relations based on the synthetic continuum levels are slightly larger  ( approximately twice as large ) than before , but this might be solely related to the unaccounted systematic uncertainties associated with the estimated radii , as well as with the fact that the synthetic spectra do not account for the continuum emission from the circumstellar regions .",
    "the origin of the circumstellar regions around be stars is still debated .",
    "one of the simpler tests is to search for a possible correlations between the size of the circumstellar region and the spectral type of the central star .",
    "figure  [ fig : size_vs_st ] illustrates the relationship between the physical extent of the major axis and the spectral type for the seven stars listed in table  [ tab : be_star_sizes ] . within our small sample of stars",
    ", it appears that the size of the h@xmath0-emitting region decreases toward later spectral type .",
    "this is also shown in figure  [ fig : size_vs_temp ] , which plots @xmath27 versus the effective temperature from table  [ tab : be_star_lum ] .",
    "the visible correlation is not nearly as strong as the one found for the h@xmath0 emission and the size of the emitting region , but it still yields a correlation coefficient of 0.75 and a slope of 1.29@xmath370.19 .",
    "unfortunately , the small number statistics make these results tentative , but with future observations of a larger set of stars , it will be possible to explore this relationship further .    if the apparent dependence of @xmath27 on the spectral type is real , it is possible that this is due to the tendency of hotter stars to have physically larger circumstellar regions , but equivalently this can also be attributed to a simple ionization effect .",
    "for example , @xcite investigated models of circumstellar regions of be stars with a range of effective temperatures and concluded that in the case of the hot be star @xmath3  cas , the circumstellar envelope is almost completely ionized , in contrast to the cool be stars  ( like @xmath2  cmi ) , whose envelopes in and near the equatorial plane  ( where most of the emission normally originates ) is mostly neutral  ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this suggests that the cooler be stars might have smaller h@xmath0-emitting regions due to the ionization - bounded conditions in their circumstellar regions .",
    "another commonly examined relationship is the one between the size of the region and the rotational velocity .",
    "the connection between the two would be expected if rotation has a direct effect on the disk formation , as originally suggested by  @xcite . in table",
    "[ tab : be_star_rotation ] we list the @xmath5 values from  @xcite , the estimated , can be used to estimate @xmath61 . ]",
    "rotational velocities  ( @xmath69 ) , along with the critical velocities from  @xcite .",
    "we find no correlation between the physical extent of the h@xmath0-emitting region and the observed @xmath5 value .",
    "this is in agreement with previous studies that concluded that there is no correlation between the strength of the h@xmath0 emission and the @xmath5 value .",
    "because we derive an inclination angle @xmath61 from the apparent ellipticity of the h@xmath0-emitting disk , our estimates on the rotational velocities of be stars are quite independent of the estimates that are obtained for systems that are thought to be viewed edge - on  ( i.e. , using be - shell stars ) .",
    "therefore our estimate on the average rotational velocity , expressed as a fraction of @xmath70 , should be independent of similar estimates obtained from observations of be - shell stars . in table",
    "[ tab : be_star_rotation ] we list the values of the ratio of @xmath69 to @xmath71 for all stars , including 48  per for which only a lower limit can be obtained  ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : size_vs_v ] ) .",
    "we obtain a weighted average  ( excluding 48  per ) of 0.64@xmath370.14 for @xmath72 , which is in excellent agreement with the work of @xcite , who concluded that the distribution of the rotational velocities is sharply peaked at @xmath160.7@xmath71 .    assuming that the @xmath5 values obtained from spectral lines are not underestimated  ( for example due to the equatorial gravity darkening caused by rapid rotation )",
    ", the above result suggests that be stars are rotating well below their critical limits . on the other hand , if the @xmath5 values are systematically underestimated by tens of percent  ( as suggested by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then it is still possible that these stars have near - critical rotation rates . a much more direct method for determining the rotational velocity of stars is the observation of the rotationally induced distortion of the stellar photosphere by long - baseline interferometry . in fact , the first result suggesting a near - critical rotation in the case of one",
    "be star already exists  @xcite .",
    "it is anticipated that with the advent of optical interferometric observations at baselines of hundreds of meters  ( such as those of the npoi ) , further observational constraints on the stellar rotation and its role in be disk formation will be possible .",
    "our analysis of the relationship between the net h@xmath0 emission and the physical extent of the emitting circumstellar region produced a clear correlation between the two properties for the first time .",
    "the functional dependence between the parameters suggests that the emission is directly proportional to the effective surface area of the emitting disk .",
    "these results are consistent with an optically thick h@xmath0 emission from a geometrically thin circumstellar disk .",
    "we do not detect any significant degree of correlation between the size of the circumstellar region and the stellar rotation rate , although the data suggest that hotter be stars might have more extended h@xmath0-emitting regions . extending our analysis to a larger sample of stars",
    "will verify if this is indeed a general property of classical be stars .    because the formation and the subsequent evolution of the circumstellar disks around be stars are still the long - standing puzzles associated with these stars , the interferometric investigations by long - baseline interferometers will play a crucial role in our understanding of these objects . already in the near - term it should be possible to detect small - scale structures within the circumstellar disks and investigate the characteristics of the inner disk regions , thereby putting specific constraints on disk formation theories .",
    "imaging small - scale structures , such as one - armed density waves or spiral structures , will yield direct information about the instabilities in the disks , possibly related in some cases to unseen binary companions .",
    "also , combining spectroscopic and interferometric observations , especially in the context of mass ejection episodes  ( which in some cases might be predicted based on spectroscopy ) will play a crucial role in our understanding of the mass - feeding mechanisms , and the subsequent evolution of the material in the disk .",
    "lastly , the direct detection of the deviation from circular symmetry of the stellar surface , due to rapid rotation , will help establish the connection between the stellar rotation and the disk formation , independently of  ( or in conjunction with ) spectroscopic studies .    the multi - spectral and",
    "the h@xmath0-filtering capabilities of the npoi make it an optimal instrument to address the above described issues .",
    "we are currently setting up the npoi for observations at baselines of up to 100  m , which will allow us to study the spatial properties of the h@xmath0-emitting regions of be stars in ways not possible before .",
    "such studies have the potential of not only contributing to our understanding of these interesting objects , but they might also make a significant contribution to other branches of stellar astrophysics .",
    "for example , the investigation of disk formation mechanism(s ) will contribute to our understanding of asymmetric mass - loss processes including stellar angular momentum distribution  ( especially in the context of rapidly rotating stars ) .",
    "the apparent outflow of the material in the circumstellar disk and its possible eventual dispersal , can be used as a test ground for examining theories related to angular momentum transfer in outflowing disks .",
