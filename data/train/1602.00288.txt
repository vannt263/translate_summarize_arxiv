    "talk we return to a phenomenological level and unveil interesting features of pp scattering via the so - called _ on - shell optical potential model_.    the optical potential was first suggested to deal with inelastic neutron - nucleus scattering above the compound nucleus regime  @xcite .",
    "there , the concept of the black disk limit was first proposed and tested along with the observed fraunhofer diffraction pattern  @xcite , which also applies to the eikonal approximation  @xcite .",
    "the serber model  @xcite was an incipient extension of the optical eikonal formalism to high energy particle physics .",
    "based on a double spectral representation of the mandelstam representation of the scattering amplitude , cornwall and ruderman delineated a definition of the optical potential directly rooted in field theory  @xcite .",

    "a general field theoretic approach requires solving a coupled channel bethe - salpeter equation involving all open channels , a most impractical a procedure , since their number becomes huge for the large energies at isr or the lhc .",

    "as usual , the scattering amplitudes are defined as boundary values of analytic complex functions , such that @xmath43 . note that due to the schwartz reflection principle @xmath44 , and thus the unitarity condition corresponds to a right - hand discontinuity cut @xmath45 , which reads @xmath46 at @xmath47 and yields two contributions .",

    "@xcite ) to give the on - shell optical potential _",
    "directly _ from the inelasticity profile and hence from data , @xmath67 this new formula is remarkable as it reconstructs the 3d on - shell dynamics from the effective transverse 2d impact parameter representation where the longitudinal physics has been integrated out .",

    "fig : imw ] we show the ratio normalized to the value at the origin , @xmath71 .",
    "as can be vividly seen , the lower energy values have a maximum at the origin , whereas the lhc pp data develop a dip in the origin , which suggests that the inelasticity becomes maximal at a finite value , around @xmath72 .",
    "the fact that the optical potential has its maximum away from the origin is most remarkable ; a feature shared by the profile function @xmath73 , which shows that in an inelastic collision most damage is not necessarily produced by central collisions .",
    "the `` hollowness '' effect is less evident in 2d as the 3d hole is integrated over the longitudinal variables which effectively fill the 3d - hole .",
    "this goes beyond the idea that the protons become `` gray '' above @xmath74 , as recently suggested by dremin  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , rather than a black disk .",
    "actually , this shows in particular that the hollowness effect can not be reproduced by an intuitive folding structure .",

    "this conclusion also holds if the folding is made between wave functions with no extra weight .",
    "finally , we note that the mean squared radius of @xmath78 ; @xmath79 displays a logarithmic growth with the energy .",
    "these surprising new high energy features as well as the fluctuations in @xmath73  @xcite become relevant in heavy ions collisions and will be addressed in more detail elsewhere .",
    "the energy interpolation of  @xcite suggests that the 3d depletion already happens at @xmath80 , below lhc energies , generating a flattening of the 2d impact parameter dependence .",
    "the on - shell optical potential is a meaningful concept under the most common and general assumption of the mandelstam double spectral representation .",
    "we have shown that it is also a useful quantity when interpreting the proton - proton scattering data at very high energies ; the shape of the inelasticity hole changes dramatically when going from isr to the lhc .",
    "the shoulder - like form of the imaginary part of the on - shell potential resembles very much the traditional pattern found in the absorptive part of optical potential in the neutron - nucleus reactions beyond the compound model regime  @xcite . for a heavy nucleus ,",
    "the surface is much smaller than the volume and the shoulder merely shows that most inelastic processes occur at the surface .",
    "this can pictorially be imagined as derivatives of a fermi - type distribution . in the case of the proton - proton scattering ,",
    "extremely high energies seem necessary to resolve between the surface from the volume effects at the attometer scales . the puzzling hollowness effect sets in at @xmath81 and awaits a dynamical explanation ."
