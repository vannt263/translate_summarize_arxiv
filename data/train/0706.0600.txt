    "embedded solitons ( es ) represent solitary waves which reside inside the continuous spectrum of a nonlinear - wave system .",
    "this type of solitons was first reported by yang et .",
    "al . [ 1 ] in optical models characterized by opposing dispersion and competing nonlinearities at fundamental and second harmonics .",
    "more specifically , optical media with quadratic @xmath0 and cubic @xmath1 nonlinear susceptibilities can support es solutions .",
    "the evolution of es is governed by the coupled nonlinear partial differential equations [ 2 ] @xmath2 and @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent the fundamental harmonic ( fh ) and second harmonic ( sh ) fields respectively . in writing @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    "we have used optical notations such that @xmath8 and @xmath9 stand for the propagation distance and reduced time .",
    "the quantity @xmath10 is the relative dispersion of sh and @xmath11 are the kerr coefficients.here q represents the group velocity mismatch originated by the frequency difference of fh and sh fields .",
    "usually , es s are studied using numerical routines to solve @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in view of",
    "this one often works within the framework of a simplified physical model where @xmath12 and neglects the cross - phase modulation ( xpm ) term ( fifth term ) in comparison with self - phase modulation ( spm ) ( fourth term ) in @xmath6 . the spm term in @xmath7 is also assumed to be negligible in comparison with its xpm counterpart .",
    "thus we get a truncated model represented by @xmath13 and @xmath14 for stationary soliton solutions one can use @xmath15 with @xmath16 , the fh wave number .",
    "the partial differential equations of the full model and those of the truncated model then reduce to ordinary differential equations given by @xmath17 @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xmath20 here the dots denote differentiation with respect to @xmath9 .",
    "linearization of the equations in @xmath6 and @xmath7 [ full model ] as well as in @xmath21 and @xmath22 [ truncated model ] shows that both models support ordinary soliton solutions in the regions @xmath23 and embedded soliton soliton solutions in the regions @xmath24    the object of the present work is to derive a straightforward analytical model for comparing the properties of soliton solutions supported by the pair of equations representing the full and truncated models .in doing",
    "so we shall consider the cases of ordinary and embedded solitons separately . to achieve this",
    "we shall envisage a variational approach to the problem , where one begins with a lagrangian for the system under consideration and constructs the so - called effective lagrangian by taking recourse to the use of trial functions for the field variables .",
    "understandably , the trial functions will involve a number of unknown parameters . as we shall see",
    "the effective lagrangian will provide a natural basis to determine these parameters .    in the above context we note that @xmath25 and @xmath26 , resulting from the full model , follow from an action principle .",
    "in contrast to this , @xmath27 and @xmath28 pertaining to the truncated model are non - lagrangian .",
    "but the latter set of equations are based on physically founded assumptions",
    ". this led kaup and malomed [ 2 ] to adapt the variational approach to the seemingly flawed system represented by @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in their method one",
    "starts with the lagrangian of the full system and drops the term containing @xmath29 to construct an expression for the effective lagrangian by using the trial functions for @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "further , the implementation of the ritz optimization procedure to evaluate the variational parameters requires one more approximation .",
    "we claim that the results in ref ( 2 ) can be rederived and reexamined without taking recourse to the use of this two - tier approximation .in particular , we find that if we work with the effective lagrangian of the full system , construct equations for the variational parameters and then use the approximation @xmath32 , we automatically arrive at the results of kaup and malomed .",
    "more significantly , the method followed by us provides a natural basis to examine how the results for @xmath30 and @xmath31 for the full model differ from those of the truncated model .",
    "one of our main objectives in this work is to compare the results of the full and truncated models and thereby gain some physical weight for the problem .",
    "we begin section ii with the lagrangian of the full system and construct the expression for the effective lagrangian using some trial functions for @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we then apply the ritz optimization procedure to obtain equations for the parameters of the trial functions and examine how the results of ref .",
    "2 are obtained for @xmath32 . in section iii",
    "we compare the results of @xmath30 and @xmath31 for the full model with those for truncated model .",
    "we represent the results for both ordinary and embedded solitons .",
    "our analysis for the properties of ordinary and embedded soliton solutions supported by the full and truncated models will involve essentially a ritz optimization procedure [ 3 ] based on the variational functional for @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "it is easily seen that these initial - boundary value problems can be converted to a variational problem with the lagrangian written as @xmath33 in the ritz optimization procedure , the first variation of the variational functional is made to vanish within a set of suitable chosen trial functions .",
    "we thus introduce the ansatz [ 2 ] @xmath34 for the time - dependent parts of the fh and sh fields . here the amplitudes @xmath35 and @xmath36 are variational parameters . the inverse width @xmath37 will , however , not be varied . inserting @xmath38 in @xmath39 and carrying out the time integral we obtain @xmath40 the effective lagrangian for @xmath30 and @xmath31 in @xmath38 .",
    "the lagrangian in @xmath41 represents a specific function of the parameters only .",
    "optimization with respect to parameters will yield a system of equations which when solved will determine @xmath30 and @xmath31 within the chosen set of trial functions and a concomitant approximation for the true solutions .",
    "this is the route we follow to determine the values of the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 .      from the vanishing conditions of @xmath42 and @xmath43 we obtain @xmath44 and @xmath45 understandably , these equations determine the parameters of the full model .",
    "to go over to the truncated model we can choose @xmath46 and neglect @xmath47 and @xmath48 in @xmath49 and @xmath50 to get @xmath51 and @xmath52 these equations were obtained by kaup and malomed [ 2 ] first by neglecting the last term in @xmath39 and then again neglecting the contribution of the term @xmath53 while taking variation with respect to @xmath35 .",
    "but we have shown that this type of two - tier approximation is not essential to make a transition from the full to the truncated model .",
    "we have seen that when the wave number @xmath16 falls into the region @xmath54 both full and truncated models have ordinary soliton solutions . to see how , in this case",
    ", the results of @xmath30 and @xmath31 for the full model differ from those of the truncated model we have chosen to work with @xmath55 . as for the full model",
    ", we use these values in @xmath49 and @xmath50 to get three values for @xmath36 , namely @xmath56 .",
    "we find that @xmath35 values corresponding to @xmath57 and @xmath58 are imaginary while @xmath35 becomes a real number equal to @xmath59 when calculated by using the value of @xmath60 .the corresponding results for the truncated model are @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the superscripts @xmath63 and @xmath64 refer to the full and truncated models .",
    "we shall also use similar superscripts on @xmath30 and @xmath31 .the ordinary or non - embedded soliton solutions are shown in fig .",
    "@xmath65 . from this figure",
    "it is clear that the curves for @xmath66 and @xmath67 are more peaked compare to the curves for @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "it will , therefore be interesting to examine how the behaviour of @xmath70 and @xmath67 is affected in the case of embedded solitons .    in consistent with @xmath71 we take @xmath72 for the embedded soliton . in this case",
    "we find @xmath73 and @xmath74 . in fig .",
    "@xmath75 we display the curves for embedded solitons . in this case also the curves for @xmath66 and @xmath67 are more peaked than the curves for @xmath68 and @xmath69 . but looking closely into the curves in figs . @xmath65 and",
    "@xmath75 we see that in the case of embedded solitons the curves for @xmath66 and @xmath67 fall off more rapidly than their non - embedded counterparts .    in the model considered in this work",
    "the energy of the soliton is given by @xmath76 .",
    "from the results in figs . 1 and 2",
    "it is clear that @xmath77 for both ordinary and embedded solitons .",
    "understandably , @xmath78 and @xmath79 stand for the soliton energies obtained by using the truncated and full models .",
    "it will , therefore , be an interesting curiosity to verify how the approximation @xmath32 affects a typical experiment .",
