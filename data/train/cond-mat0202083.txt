    "understanding superconductivity in the cuprates is one of the great challenges of physics . determining the nature of single particle excitations is of fundamental importance for achieving this goal .",
    "two types of experiments have been extensively used to study such excitations : angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) and tunneling .    in this paper , which deals with the superconducting state only , we address the questions , what the spectral properties of fermionic excitations are , and how their low - energy dispersion is renormalized .",
    "we do not directly address the question of the origin of superconductivity in the cuprates .",
    "rather , we assume that an effective pairing interaction exists , and study the additional effects which coupling to certain collective excitations present in cuprates have in renormalizing single particle properties .",
    "the corresponding collective excitations responsible for such renormalizations are most directly seen in other types of experiments .",
    "one of them , inelastic neutron scattering , gives the most useful information about both phonons and magnetic excitations in the energy range of interest ( @xmath1mev ) .",
    "motivated by earlier work,@xcite we have presented in ref .   a model which describes the arpes and tunneling spectra . here ,",
    "we describe details of our calculations , and extend them by including the effect of the spin fluctuation continuum .",
    "in addition , we address the issue of the doping dependence of the arpes spectra .",
    "finally , for comparison , we discuss the effect on the electrons of coupling to a particular phonon which was recently suggested to account for the renormalization of the arpes dispersion in the nodal regions of the zone .",
    "our outline is the following : starting in section ii from the information which experiments give about single particle properties of low lying excitations in cuprates , we look for a suitable collective excitation which best fits the data .",
    "then , we develop in section iii a model in which the collective mode is identified as the magnetic resonance observed in inelastic neutron scattering experiments . the results of calculations using this model are presented in great detail .",
    "finally , in section iv , we address the question what electron - phonon coupling contributes to renormalization effects on the dispersion .",
    "section v offers a brief summary .",
    "it has been known for some time that near the @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) point of the zone , the spectral function in the superconducting state of bi@xmath4sr@xmath4cacu@xmath4o@xmath5 shows an anomalous lineshape , the so called ` peak - dip - hump ' structure.@xcite this structure was also found recently in yba@xmath4cu@xmath6o@xmath7,@xcite and in bi@xmath4sr@xmath4ca@xmath4cu@xmath6o@xmath8.@xcite for the notation of special points in the brillouin zone which we use throughout this paper , see fig .",

    "= 0.25    extensive studies on bi@xmath4sr@xmath4cacu@xmath4o@xmath5 as a function of temperature revealed that this characteristic shape of the spectral function is closely related to the superconducting state . in the normal state ,",
    "the arpes spectral function is broadened strongly in energy , the broadening increasing with underdoping.@xcite the width of the spectral peak quickly decreases with decreasing temperature below @xmath0,@xcite and sharp quasiparticle peaks were identified well below @xmath0 along the entire fermi surface.@xcite when lowering the temperature below @xmath0 , the coherent quasiparticle peak grows at the position of the leading edge gap , and the incoherent spectral weight is redistributed to higher energy , giving rise to a dip and hump structure.@xcite this peak - dip - hump structure is most strongly developed near the @xmath3-point of the brillouin zone .",
    "the well defined quasiparticle peaks at low energies contrasts to the high energy spectra , which show a broad linewidth which grows linearly in energy.@xcite this implies that a scattering channel present in the normal state becomes gapped in the superconducting state.@xcite the high energy excitations then stay broadened , since they involve scattering events above the threshold energy .",
    "while this explains the existence of sharp quasiparticle peaks , a gap in the bosonic spectrum which mediates electron interactions leads only to a weak diplike feature.@xcite this suggests that the dip feature is instead due to the interaction of electrons with a sharp ( in energy ) bosonic mode .",
    "the sharpness implies a strong self energy effect at an energy equal to the mode energy plus the quasiparticle peak energy , giving rise to a spectral dip.@xcite the fact that the effects are strongest at the @xmath3 points implies a mode momentum close to the @xmath9 wavevector.@xcite    more clues are obtained by studying the dispersion of the related self energy effects .",
    "recent advances in the momentum resolution of arpes have led to a detailed mapping of the spectral lineshape in the high @xmath0 superconductor bi@xmath10sr@xmath10cacu@xmath10o@xmath11 throughout the brillouin zone.@xcite the data indicated a seemingly unrelated effect near the d - wave node of the superconducting gap , where the dispersion shows a characteristic ` kink ' feature : for binding energies less than the kink energy , the spectra exhibit sharp peaks with a weaker dispersion ; beyond this , broad peaks with a stronger dispersion.@xcite this kink is present at a particular energy all around the fermi surface,@xcite and away from the node , the dispersion as determined from constant energy spectra ( momentum distribution curves , mdcs ) shows an s - like shape in the vicinity of the kink.@xcite the similarity between the excitation energy where the kink is observed and the dip energy at @xmath3 , however , suggests that these effects are related.@xcite additionally , the observation that the spectral width for binding energies greater than the kink energy is much broader than that for smaller energies@xcite is very similar to the difference in the linewidth between the peak and the hump at the @xmath3 points .",
    "further experimental studies supported the idea of a unique energy scale involved.@xcite they found that away from the node , the kink in the dispersion as determined from constant momentum spectra ( energy distribution curves , edcs ) develops into a ` break ' ; the two resulting branches are separated by an energy gap , and overlap in momentum space . towards @xmath3 , the break evolves into a pronounced spectral ` dip ' separating the almost dispersionless quasiparticle branch from the weakly dispersing high energy branch ( the ` hump ' ) .",
    "the kink , break , and dip features all occur at roughly the same energy , independent of position in the zone,@xcite the kink being at a slightly smaller energy than the break feature.@xcite    the high energy dispersion is renormalized up to at least 200 mev and does not extrapolate to the fermi surface crossing.@xcite this lets us conclude that the continuum part of the bosonic spectrum coupling to the fermionic excitations extends to high energies .    finally , there is important information contained in the doping dependence of the self energy effects . in underdoped compounds ,",
    "there is a pseudogap between @xmath0 and @xmath12;@xcite the pseudogap is maximal near the @xmath3-point of the brillouin zone and is zero at arcs centered at the @xmath13-points which increase with temperature.@xcite in the pseudogap state above @xmath0 , there are low energy renormalizations in the dispersion , and some trace of the kink feature persists .",
    "but in the recent work by johnson _",
    "et al._@xcite , it was clearly shown that an additional renormalization of the dispersion sets in just at @xmath0 .",
    "this indicates that the bosonic spectrum redistributes its spectral weight when entering the superconducting state .",
    "the additional low energy renormalization of the dispersion below the kink energy follows an order parameter like behavior as a function of temperature.@xcite arguing that the renormalization near the nodal regions is influenced by the coupling to the same bosonic mode which causes the strong self energy effects at the @xmath3 point of the brillouin zone , the above implies that some mode intensity may be present in the pseudogap state already , but there is an abrupt increase in the mode intensity when going from the pseudogap state into the superconducting state , and this increase shows an order parameter like behavior as a function of temperature below @xmath0 .",
    "the energy of the mode , as inferred from the energy separation @xmath14 between the peak and the dip , was shown to decrease with underdoping.@xcite similarly , the kink energy is maximal at optimal doping and decreases both with underdoping and overdoping,@xcite indicating some relationship between the kink at the nodal @xmath13 point and the peak - dip - hump structure at the @xmath3 point . with underdoping",
    ", the sharp quasiparticle peak moves to higher binding energy , indicating that the gap increases.@xcite at the same time , the spectral weight @xmath15 of the peak drops@xcite leaving the quantity @xmath16 roughly constant.@xcite also , the hump moves to higher binding energy and loses weight with underdoping.@xcite this doping evolution of the quasiparticle peak points to an increasing mode intensity at the @xmath9 wavevector with underdoping .",
    "again , there is a similarity to the nodal direction : the low energy renormalization of the dispersion below the kink energy increases with underdoping,@xcite consistent with a common origin of both effects .",
    "unusual spectral dip features in tunneling data of bi@xmath4sr@xmath4cacu@xmath4o@xmath17 are found in point contact junctions,@xcite in scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( stm),@xcite in break junctions,@xcite and in intrinsic c - axis tunnel junctions.@xcite consistently , these data show a peak feature , usually assigned to the maximal @xmath18-wave superconducting gap , and a hump feature at higher bias , separated from the peak by a pronounced dip feature .",
    "a characteristic of this dip feature in sin junctions is that it occurs asymmetrically around the chemical potential , usually stronger on the occupied side of the spectrum.@xcite this asymmetry was succesfully explained within the theoretical model presented below.@xcite the dip feature has been observed in tunneling spectra of the single cu - o@xmath4 layer compound tl@xmath4ba@xmath4cuo@xmath19 as well.@xcite    in order to extract information about the bosonic mode which would produce a dip feature in the tunneling conductance , a systematic study as a function of doping was performed in break junction tunneling spectroscopy by zasadzinski _",
    "et al._@xcite there , the doping dependence in bi@xmath4sr@xmath4cacu@xmath4o@xmath17 of the peak - dip - hump structure was determined over a wide range of doping .",
    "it was found that the dip - peak energy separation , @xmath20 , follows @xmath0 as @xmath21 . as expected for an excitonic mode , @xmath20 approaches but",
    "never exceeds @xmath22 in the overdoped region , and @xmath23 monotonically decreases as doping decreases and the superconducting gap increases .",
    "the dip feature is found to be strongest near optimal doping .",
    "similar shifts of the dip position with overdoping were reported prevously by stm.@xcite together with the arpes results , these studies give a detailed picture about the doping dependence of the mode energy involved in electron interactions in the superconducting state .",
    "there have been several theoretical treatments which assigned the anomalous arpes lineshape near the @xmath3 point of the zone to the coupling between spin fluctuations and electrons.@xcite the ` collective mode model ' proposed by norman and ding@xcite was suggested to account for the unusual apres lineshapes by coupling electrons to a dispersionless collective mode .",
    "the main motivation for a more detailed study of this model in ref .   was to additionally account for the dispersion anomalies ( ` kink ' ) , and the isotropy and robustness of this characteristic energy scale.@xcite    the minimal set of characteristics for the collective mode we are interested in follows from the experimental results from arpes and tunneling .",
    "the mode is characterized by its energy and its intensity at the @xmath9 wavevector ( the wavevector being suggested by the momentum dependence of the strength of the arpes anomalies ) .",
    "its properties from arpes and sis tunneling are as follows",
    ". the energy should be weakly dependent on momentum , roughly 40 mev in optimally doped cuprates , follow @xmath0 with doping , and be constant with increasing temperature up to @xmath0 .",
    "the intensity should be maximal at the @xmath9 wavevector , where it should increase with underdoping and follow an order parameter like behavior as a function of temperature below @xmath24 .",
    "the mode should be absent in the normal state ; a remnant can be present in the pseudogap state , but an abrupt increase in intensity should occur at @xmath0 with lowering temperature .    a sharp resonance with characteristics fitting the ones extracted from arpes and tunneling measurements was observed in inelastic neutron scattering experiments on bilayer cuprates in the superconducting state , with an energy near 40 mev in optimally doped compounds.@xcite a similar resonance feature at the @xmath9 wavevector is observed in underdoped yba@xmath4cu@xmath6o@xmath25 , but at a reduced energy.@xcite the resonance was also found in bi@xmath10sr@xmath10cacu@xmath10o@xmath11 , both in the optimally doped@xcite and overdoped@xcite regime .",
    "recently , the resonance was discovered in single layer tl@xmath4ba@xmath4cuo@xmath19 compound as well.@xcite    to show how well the above criteria fit , we summarize its characteristics : the resonance is narrow in energy and magnetic in origin.@xcite its energy width is smaller than the instrumental resolution ( typically less than 10 mev ) for optimally and moderately underdoped materials .",
    "strongly underdoped materials show a small broadening of the order of 10 mev.@xcite the resonance lies below a gapped continuum , the latter having a signal typically a factor of 30 less than the maximum at @xmath26 at the mode energy.@xcite the mode energy decreases with underdoping , and has its maximal value of about 40 mev at optimal doping.@xcite in both underdoped and overdoped regimes , the resonance energy , @xmath27 , is proportional to @xmath0 , with @xmath28.@xcite    an additional aspect , specific to bilayer materials , is that it only occurs in the ` odd ' channel , which connects the bonding combination of the bilayer bands to the antibonding one.@xcite the continuum is gapped in both the even and odd scattering channels ( the even channel is gapped by @xmath2960 mev , even in the normal state).@xcite we will address this issue further below .",
    "the resonance is strongly peaked at the @xmath9 wavevector .",
    "the momentum width of the spin fluctuation spectrum is minimal at the resonance energy,@xcite where it is ( in contrast to the off - resonant momentum width ) only weakly doping dependent , with a full width of about 0.22 @xmath30.@xcite this corresponds to a correlation length @xmath31 of about two lattice spacings .",
    "a sharp resonance is not observed above @xmath0.@xcite on approaching @xmath0 from below , the resonance energy does not shift towards lower energy,@xcite but its intensity decreases towards @xmath0 , following an order parameter like behavior.@xcite with underdoping , the intensity at @xmath32 increases from about 1.6 @xmath33 for yba@xmath4cu@xmath6o@xmath34 to about 2.6 @xmath33 per unit cell volume for yba@xmath4cu@xmath6o@xmath35.@xcite there is clearly an abrupt change in resonance intensity at @xmath0 , even in underdoped compounds .",
    "note that in underdoped materials , an incommensurate response develops below the resonance energy,@xcite which however never extends to zero energy , but instead the spectrum is limited at low energies by the so called spin gap @xmath36.@xcite this part of the spectrum behaves differently from the resonance part as a function of doping.@xcite we will neglect this ( weaker ) incommensurate part of the spectrum in this paper .    the total spectral weight of the resonance is small and amounts to about 0.06@xmath33 per formula unit at low temperatures.@xcite we will show below that the smallness of the weight of the resonance is not an obstacle to achieving large self energy effects .",
    "we are interested in the renormalizations of the fermionic dispersion due to coupling of electrons to a sharp spin fluctuation mode at low energies , equal to about 40 mev or less .",
    "we will assume that superconducting order is already established without coupling to this resonant feature in the spin flucutation spectrum , and thus describe the superconducting state by an independent order parameter @xmath37 .",
    "this order parameter will be chosen to have @xmath18-wave symmetry ( here and in the following the unit of length is the lattice constant @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 which takes its maximal value @xmath40 at the @xmath3 point in the brillouin zone . the magnitude @xmath40 will be chosen so that the calculated peak in the arpes spectrum at the @xmath3 point , after including self energy effects due to coupling to the spin fluctuations , fits the position of the spectral peak in experimental arpes spectra .",
    "we stress that we do not specify the origin of the pairing interaction responsible for the order parameter @xmath37 , but the continuum part of the spin fluctuations is one of the candidates .",

    "if in the coherent tunneling limit the corresponding term proportional to @xmath277 is very small , then the main contribution comes from the region where either @xmath278 or @xmath279 , varying within a range of order @xmath40 around these values .",

    "our studies have shown that the quasiparticle peak is always reasonably well separated in energy from the high energy incoherent part by a dip . by coupling electrons to the spin resonance mode , weight is shifted from the quasiparticle peak to the incoherent part which includes the broad hump structure .",
    "thus , when calculating the self energy effects due to this coupling , only the quasiparticle peak part of the spectrum with its reduced weight will contribute to the sharp self energy features at energies affecting the quasiparticle peak .",
    "the incoherent part of the fermionic spectrum , which is gapped by roughly the hump energy , will affect the low energy quasiparticle properties only in form of an effective high energy renormalization factor , which is constant up to energies comparable to the hump energy .",
    "this effective renormalization adds to the one due to coupling of electrons to the spin fluctuation continuum .",
    "thus , we can concentrate on the renormalization equations following from the set of equations which includes the quasiparticle peak spectrum of reduced weight interacting with the spin fluctuation mode . in deriving these equations , we make use of the approximate equations for the renormalization functions derived above .",
    "the quasiparticle part of the green s function has in this approximation at the @xmath3 point the form @xmath281 where @xmath282 and @xmath283 . here , @xmath284 is the measured peak position at the @xmath3 point , and @xmath285 is the quasiparticle peak width .",
    "the broadening of the off - diagonal spectra , @xmath286 , is reduced compared to @xmath285 due to @xmath18-wave symmetry . using the approximative formulas from the last sections at @xmath287 , we obtain ( with @xmath288 ) @xmath289 where @xmath290 denotes renormalizations due to the spin fluctuation continuum and the incoherent part of the spectral function , and @xmath133 the contribution coming from the nodal regions ( these contributions are renormalized with the nodal renormalization factor @xmath291 , which is smaller than @xmath292 ) .",
    "the last two equations merely express the measurable quantities @xmath293 and @xmath294 as functions of the bare quantities @xmath40 and @xmath50 .",

    "note that we derived this set of equations for the case where @xmath296 is neglected , which describes the slightly underdoped region .",
    "when @xmath27 becomes comparable to @xmath296 , these equations have to be modified",
    ".    it should be remarked , though , that using these equations in the absence of vertex corrections usually give poorer results than those presented in this paper using bare green s functions.@xcite      for bilayer compounds , the dispersion can be split into bonding ( @xmath297 ) and antibonding ( @xmath38 ) bands .",
    "accordingly , the self energy for each band is defined as @xmath298 and @xmath299 .",
    "similarly , the spin susceptibility is now a matrix in the bonding - antibonding indices , having elements diagonal ( @xmath300 , @xmath301 ) and off - diagonal @xmath302 , @xmath303 ) in the bonding - antibonding representation .",
    "the components of the spin susceptibility transforming even and odd with respect to the plane indices are given by @xmath304 and @xmath305 .",
    "for identical planes , we have @xmath306 and @xmath307 .",
    "the measured susceptibility is then given by @xmath308 where @xmath18 is the separation of the layers within a bilayer .",
    "if we write the self energy for a single layer as @xmath309 ( the hat denotes the 2x2 particle hole space ) , which is a functional of the spin susceptibility @xmath310 and the gorkov - green s function @xmath311 , then we have formally for the two - layer system @xmath312 for the resonance part , which only has a @xmath313 component , this means that fermionic excitations of the antibonding band determine the self energy for the bonding band and vice versa . the calculations presented in this paper hold for the case of bilayer systems if we assume identical dispersions for bonding and antibonding bands .",
    "even small bilayer splittings of the order of 10 mev or less do not matter , as they do not qualitatively alter the spectral form of the self energy . for larger bilayer splittings ,",
    "the self energy is larger for the bonding band , because it is determined by the van hove singularity near the chemical potential in the antibonding band .",
    "thus , stronger renormalizations are expected in the bonding band for this case , which tends to decrease the bonding - antibonding splitting .",
    "this effect of reducing the bilayer splitting should be strongest in underdoped compounds , where the effect of the resonance mode is strongest .",
    "in overdoped compounds , the bilayer splitting should be less affected by spin fluctuations .",
    "our prediction is that if a bilayer splitting is observed , then the peak - dip - hump structure should be stronger for the bonding band with the higher binding energy peak .",
    "this is consistent with the data of ref .  .",
    "the _ onset _ of strong fermionic damping should be independent of the band index , as it is given by scattering to the nodes , and thus occurs at the fixed energy @xmath27 .    in this paper ,",
    "we have elected not to explicitly include bilayer splitting effects in our calculations .",
    "the primary reason is that although all arpes groups now detect the presence of bilayer splitting for heavily overdoped samples , the various groups disagree on its presence for optimal and underdoped samples @xcite .",
    "recently , we have performed calculations including bilayer splitting and are able to reproduce a number of unusual spectral anomalies seen in heavily overdoped arpes spectra @xcite .",
    "these calculations further confirm the picture advocated in this paper , in that the spectral anomalies imply a mode which has odd symmetry with respect to the layer index of the bilayer , a unique property of the magnetic resonance observed by neutrons . for further details ,",
    "the reader is referred to ref .  .",
    "in this section , we deal with the doping dependence of the spectral lineshape near the @xmath3 point of the brillouin zone .",
    "as there are many parameters which change with doping in different ways , it could turn out to be a meaningless task to adjust all of those parameters and at the same time make a sensible prediction .",
    "but , fortunately , all changes with doping lead to spectral changes which go in the same direction .",
    "this ` fortuitous ' accident allows us to make some general predictions from the theory we use . to see this",

    "from there we see that the quasiparticle weight decreases with decreasing @xmath314 , and with increasing coupling constant @xmath315 . the quasiparticle scattering rate increases with decreasing @xmath314 . and",
    "the hump energy disperses to higher binding energies for increasing coupling constant and increasing @xmath50 .",
    "thus , in our model , going from overdoping to underdoping amounts to a decreasing quasiparticle weight , an increasing quasiparticle scattering rate , and an increasing hump binding energy .    the important parameter , as we see from this study , is the ratio @xmath316 , the ratio of the mode energy to the maximal superconducting @xmath18-wave gap .",

    "as @xmath326 is about the same as @xmath40 , we have shown in fig .  [ phasediagram ] the line for @xmath327 as a dashed line , which determines the position of the dip fairly accurately .",
