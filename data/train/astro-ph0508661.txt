    "recently , several groups have reported the detection of h- and he - like oxygen absorption lines from the local ( @xmath8 ) hot gas in the x - ray spectra of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) with _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ x - ray observatories @xcite . the detected column densities of highly - ionized oxygen are around @xmath9 , which has been suggested to be an indication for the presence of large amounts of intergalactic `` warm - hot '' gas at temperatures around @xmath10 k. this suggestion , if confirmed , would have strong implications for our understanding of the so - called missing baryon problem @xcite . in turn , by comparing nearby x - ray absorbers to highly uv ionized absorption systems observed at various redshifts from @xmath11 0.2 out to @xmath12 4 @xcite , these data could shed light on the thermal and chemical evolution of the universe .",
    "however , one critical question remains open : where are these highly - ionized @xmath8 x - ray absorbers  in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the galactic disk , in an extended galactic halo , in the local group , or even beyond ?    we here report _",
    "grating observations of lmc x3 in its high state to discriminate between the galactic and extragalactic scenarios of the absorption .",
    "because this bright x - ray source is in our neighboring galaxy , the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) at the distance of @xmath13 kpc , the detection of the absorption offers a direct measurement of the hot gas content along a line of sight through essentially the entire galaxy , including its halo .",
    "the consistency between this measurement and those in the agn sight - lines provides a direct constraint on the residual absorption on scales greater than the lmc distance .",
    "we supplement the _ chandra _ data with a nearly simultaneous far - uv observation obtained with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse)_.    lmc x3 is perhaps the best - suited source for this experiment . among the several bright x - ray binaries in both the small and large magellanic clouds ,",
    "lmc x3 normally exhibits a very soft x - ray spectrum , which is dominated by the accretion disk emission , and an exceptionally high luminosity during its high state .",
    "unlike most black hole systems , lmc x3 spends most of its time in the high state .",
    "lmc x3 is outside the main body of the lmc and is about 5@xmath14 away from the active star forming 30 doradus region , where lmc x1 and two neutron star x - ray binaries x2 and x4 are located ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lmc_ha ] ) .",
    "therefore , the potential absorption contribution from hot gas local to the lmc is minimal .",
    "finally , lmc x3 has a systemic velocity of @xmath15 , comparable to the expected velocity ( @xmath16 ) for the projected location in the lmc ( cowley et al .",
    "this velocity makes it relatively straight forward to distinguish a spectral line that is local to the x - ray binary or to the lmc from that associated with the galactic disk .",
    "we have analyzed and interpreted the  and  data almost independently , but the results and conclusions found are in nearly complete agreement .",
    "therefore , we try to keep this independence in the presentation of this paper .",
    "we adopt the galactic ism metal abundances given by @xcite ( e.g. , the oxygen and neon number fractions are @xmath17 and @xmath18 , compared to the typically assumed solar values @xmath19 and",
    "@xmath20 ; @xcite ) ; both the constraint on the abundances and the effect of the relative elemental fraction change on our results are discussed in  4 .",
    "furthermore , our spectroscopic analysis assumes that the x - ray - absorbing gas is in a collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) .",
    "the parameter uncertainties in this paper are quoted at the 68% and 90% confidence levels for the far - uv and x - ray measurements , respectively , unless otherwise noted .",
    "our experiment used the  low energy transmission grating plus the high resolution camera ( letg - hrc ) combination , chiefly for its high sensitivity to detect the k@xmath0 line .",
    "the spectral resolution of the letg - hrc is 0.05    ( fwhm ) .",
    "lmc x3 is a variable black hole x - ray binary and its soft x - ray flux varies quasi - periodically on a period of 99 or 199 days @xcite .",
    "we thus proposed the experiment as a target - of - opportunity ( too ) program during the _ chandra _ cycle 5 . because of the newly imposed solar pitch angle constraints on  pointing duration , our proposed 100 ks exposure was split into three separate observations of 20 , 40 , and 40 ksec , taken on april 20 , may 4 , and may 8 , 2004 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : asm ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the x - ray intensity of lmc x3 decreased unusually rapidly from the peak when the too was triggered ; by the time of the latter two ( longer ) observations , the count rates had dropped by a factor of @xmath21 . nevertheless , we still collected more than @xmath22 good events in the energy range 10 - 40   along the two high resolution grating arms .",
    "we processed the lmc x-3 data , using the standard ciao threads ( version 3.2.1 ) with the calibration database caldb ( version 3.0.0 ) .",
    "as described in the observatory guide ( version 7.0 ) , `` the letg diffracts x - rays into a dispersed spectrum according to the grating diffraction relation , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the integer order number , @xmath25 the photon wavelength , @xmath26 the spatial period of the grating lines , and @xmath27 the dispersion angle . ''",
    "therefore , events recorded at each @xmath27 of an observation consist of photons at multiple wavelengths in different orders . generally , this spectral order overlapping is most serious at long wavelengths , because both the intrinsic source photon flux and the effective collecting area of the telescope / instrument decrease with photon energy .",
    "the overlapping orders can not be sorted out locally in an observed spectrum , because the hrc itself lacks sufficient energy resolution .",
    "we used a forward modeling approach to globally account for the spectral order overlapping (  3.1 ) . to facilitate such modeling",
    ", we constructed a grating response matrix file ( rmf ) and an auxiliary response ( or effective area ) function ( arf ) for each order ( from the 1st to the 6th ) of each grating arm , by running the threads _",
    "mkgrmf _ and _ mkgarf_. we then added the six arf and rmf pairs together to form an order - combined response file ( rsp ) for each grating arm .",
    "this rsp file accounts for not only the local line response , but also the global spectral overlapping of the orders . for ease of processing and visualization , we further co - added the spectra : first the negative and positive arms , and then the individual observations .",
    "the corresponding rsp files were averaged channel by channel and weighted by the best - fit global models of individual spectra ( see  3.1 ) . as consistency check , our analysis was often repeated with the individual spectra before the co - adding .      to complement the _ chandra _ observations",
    ", we also obtained high - resolution ultraviolet spectroscopy of lmc x-3 via a too observation with _",
    "the _ fuse _ data cover the resonance - line doublet at 1031.93 and 1037.62  , which is valuable for understanding the ionization and single phase vs. multi - phase nature of highly - ionized absorbers ( tripp & savage 2000 ; tripp et al .",
    "2001 ; mathur et al . 2003 ; sembach et al .",
    "2004 , savage et al . 2005a , b ; collins , shull , & giroux 2005 ) . moreover , the spectral resolution of _ fuse _ ( fwhm @xmath28 20 km s@xmath29 ) is at least an order of magnitude higher than that of any current x - ray spectrograph .",
    "consequently , the _ fuse _ observation provides robust information about the kinematics and line broadening as well as the likely location of the gas ( the milky way vs. the lmc ) based on line velocities . in cie , the population of ions peaks sharply at @xmath30 k , whereas and trace gas over a broad temperature range ( @xmath31 k ; @xcite )",
    "however , in terms of column density detection , the _ fuse _ observation is more sensitive to than the  observation is to and can actually be used to trace gas with a temperature as high as @xmath32 k.    the _ fuse _ and _ chandra _ observations were coordinated to occur as simultaneously as possible .",
    "the requirement of simultaneous x - ray and uv observations was primarily for investigation of the accretion - disk physics and intrinsic properties of lmc x-3 , which will be presented in a separate paper .",
    "the _ fuse _ data were obtained in a single visit on 20 april 2004 for a total on - source integration time of 88.9 ks .",
    "the program employed the lwrs ( 30@xmath3330  ) aperture and time - tag mode , but only data from the lif1 channel were useful ( other channels were not adequately co - aligned ) .",
    "the data were reduced with calfuse ( v3.0.7 ) following standard procedures . for _ fuse _ , lmc x-3 is a relatively faint target , and it is difficult to determine shifts between sub - exposures for alignment and co - addition .",
    "however , since all sub - exposures were obtained during a single visit , such shifts should be small or negligible in the lif1 channel .",
    "the final , co - added spectrum was binned to @xmath34 km s@xmath29 pixels ( roughly 3 pixels per resolution element ) .    before execution of our program ,",
    "lmc x-3 had been observed with _ fuse _ in 2002",
    "( see hutchings et al .",
    "2003 ) . while the total integration time ( @xmath35 ks ) obtained by hutchings et al",
    ". was significantly shorter than the exposure time of the new observation , it turns out that lmc x-3 was also substantially brighter ( in the uv region near the doublet ) when hutchings et al . observed it .",
    "consequently , the signal - to - noise ratios of the old and new observations are comparable . in principle , if some absorption is circumstellar , then the absorption lines could vary between observations .",
    "however , we have acquired and re - reduced the older lmc x-3 _ fuse _ data obtained by hutchings et al . , and we find that the absorption lines in the old and new data appear to be identical within the noise .",
    "therefore , we have elected to coadd all of the data ( lif1a and lif2b from hutchings et al . and",
    "lif1a from the new program ) .",
    "because the flux varied significantly between the 2002 and 2004 observations , we fitted the continua of the three spectra independently and then coadded the continuum - normalized data , weighted inversely by their variances . the continua were fitted with low - order polynomials in the regions within @xmath36 km s@xmath29 of the @xmath37 line .",
    "hutchings et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found that the velocity of the emission centroid varies by 100 - 150 km s@xmath29 as a function of the x - ray binary phase , and they derived an orbital semiamplitude of 130 - 200 km s@xmath29 for the putative black hole in lmc x-3 .",
    "our new observations show a narrow emission feature at lmc velocities that shifts position as the binary phase changes , and the shifts are in the same direction as reported by hutchings et al . however , the shifting emission feature in the new data is narrower than the emission presented by hutchings et al .",
    "we will present a full analysis of the emission in a separate paper .",
    "however , it is relevant here because the narrow emission can lead to a complicated continuum shape against which absorption is measured .",
    "misplacement of the continuum due to the emission could cause absorption features to be incorrectly measured . to avoid this problem , before coadding the data , we collected the data into five phase ranges .",
    "in each phase range , we examined the spectrum to identify the wavelength range affected by the narrow emission , and we masked and excluded that wavelength range from the final , coadded spectrum . because the emission is narrow and shifts substantially in velocity , this masking procedure still allowed accumulation of adequate signal at all wavelengths , i.e. , no regions of the spectrum were masked out entirely .",

    "we first try an absorbed disk blackbody plus power - law model , but obtain a poor spectral fit ( @xmath42 , corresponding to a statistical null hypothesis confidence of @xmath43 ) .",
    "this poor fit is largely due to various local deviations from the model .",
    "these deviations are likely due to the current imperfect calibration of the instrument response ( i.e. , the adopted rsp ) , which does not accurately account for such effects as the dithered hrc - s plate gaps @xcite , and to the uncertainties in various emission and absorption models ( e.g. , neutral absorption edges ; juett , schulz , & chakrabarty 2004 ) . following @xcite , we include eight _ broad _ gaussian components ( three positive and five negative ) to account for such local spectral deviations .",
    "the inclusion of these broad components improves the continuum fit substantially ( @xmath44 ) and typically has insignificant effects on _ narrow _ lines that we want to measure .",
    "we find that the , , and k@xmath0 absorption lines are clearly visible at their expected rest - frame wavelengths ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ufs ] ; the relevant atomic parameters and references are summarized in table 3 of @xcite ) .",

    "we also obtain the one - sided 95% confidence upper bounds to the ews of k@xmath1 and k@xmath0 absorption lines ( listed in table  [ tab : lineresults ] ) , by fixing their centroids to the rest - frame energies and jointly - fitting their line widths with the k@xmath0 line .",
    "the inclusion of these two line components in the fit does not significantly reduce the @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "we further check the centroid and ew of the k@xmath0 line in the three observations separately , and we find no evidence for any significant variation",
    ".    to estimate the physical parameters of the x - ray - absorbing gas , we jointly fit the k@xmath0 , k@xmath1 , k@xmath0 , and k@xmath0 lines , using the multiplicative absorption line model , _ absline _ , as detailed in @xcite .",
    "briefly , the model adopts an accurate absorption line profile ( voigt function ) and accounts for the line saturation automatically .",

    "but foundamentally , from our measurements we have both lower and upper bounds on the  and  k@xmath0 absorption lines and only upper bounds on the  k@xmath1 and  k@xmath0 lines , i.e. , a total six measurements .",

    "in fact , we can do a bit better , considering that @xmath63 and @xmath56 are not totally independent and that the demand for the very existence of the solution places additional constraint on the parameters , as is demonstrated in the following .",
    "we can better illustrate how the specific parameter constraints may be realized by using an alternative ( but not independent ) approach , the curve - of - growth ( cog ) analysis , which is relatively simple and is particularly good for visualization ( e.g. , williams et al .",

    "[ fig : n_vs_b ] illustrates that the tight constraints on both @xmath55 and @xmath56 in our case are derived chiefly from the upper and lower bounds to the k@xmath0 , the lower bound to k@xmath0 , and the upper bound to the k@xmath1 ew measurements .",
    "apparently , these four ew bounds do not necessarily lead to a non - zero overlapping region , depending on the assumed @xmath63 and ne / o ratio .",

    ", the upper bounds to k@xmath1 and k@xmath0 provide additional constraints , especially on the upper limit to @xmath63 .",

    "this simplistic plot is for illustration purpose only ; the actual measurements of the parameters are based on the joint - fits of the multiple absorption lines , as detailed in the text .",
    "[ fig : n_vs_b ] , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the cog approach , however , has its drawbacks .",
    "first , it does not use all the information in the spectrum , at least not in a coherent fashion ; absorption lines are measured independently ( thus the improved counting statistics from a combination of multiple weak lines is not capitalized ) .",
    "second , the joint - analysis of two or more lines in a cog diagnostic plot , though informative , does not allow for a rigorous error propagation of the parameter constraints ; for example , it is difficult to quantify the overlapping significance and/or to include the uncertainties in the assumed temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n_vs_b ] ) .",
    "third , the ew measurement from the negative _ gaussian _ model can be problematic , especially when the absorption line is saturated ( e.g. , an optical depth @xmath68 at the line center of the k@xmath0 line in the spectrum of lmc  x3 ) ; the ew value can be significantly over - estimated ( see fig . 4 in yao & wang 2005 ) .",

    "[ fig : n_vs_b ] represents only a cut in a multiple dimensional parameter space constrained by the absorption line measurements ( e.g. , via an _ absline _ model fit ) .",

    "we analyzed the _ fuse _ observation entirely independently from the _ chandra _ results , i.e. , no constraints from the x - ray data were imposed on the _ fuse _ measurements .",
    "the low uv flux level makes lmc x-3 a challenging target for _ fuse _ , and most of the useful information in the _ fuse _ spectrum is in the 1030 - 1040   range where the flux is elevated by a broad emission feature @xcite .",

    "a maximum likelihood analysis indicates no significant intrinsic ( non - statistical ) dispersion in these measurements , but the allowed 1@xmath72 upper limit is consistent with the adopted absolute photon energy scale uncertainty .",
    "accounting for both the statistical and systematic uncertainties , we conclude that the lmc origin of the highly - ionized x - ray absorption lines detected in the lmc x3 observations can be ruled out kinematically at @xmath98 confidence .",
    "what is the origin of the cool oxygen absorption lines ?  and  trace the cold and warm phases of the ism @xcite . from the ew measurements of the  and  k@xmath0 absorption lines , the cog plots of @xcite , and the galactic ism oxygen abundance , we estimate the equivalent hydrogen column densities of the cold and warm phases as 3.2(1.9 , 5.3 ) @xmath99 and 1.2(0.5 , 2.0 ) @xmath99 , respectively ( neglecting a potenital , but typically small contribution ) .",
    "these column densities , especially their lower limits , are not sensitive to the exact @xmath56 ( assumed to be @xmath100 ; @xcite ) and are consistent with @xmath101 estimated from the oxygen absorption edge analysis of an _ xmm - newton _ grating spectrum of lmc x3 @xcite .",
    "the consistent column density values are also obtained in modeling the broad band continuum observed with _",
    "@xcite and  (   1 ) .",
    "the warm gas column density is in good agreement with the value expected from the so - called reynold s layer of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "the cold gas is further traced by the 21 cm emission line ( though with a poor spatial resolution ) , which gives a neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath102 in the lmc x3 field and shows a mean velocity of @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "there is little emission in the 100 - 430 @xmath104 velocity range ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "these values are consistent with the absorption seen in the uv spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fusespec ] ) ; bearing in mind that a substantial portion of the feature at lmc velocities is actually due to * and @xmath251037.62 at @xmath106 km s@xmath29 , any remaining at @xmath107 300 km s@xmath29 could easily arise in gas with @xmath108 ( ) @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , the cool oxygen absorption lines are also primarily galactic .",
    "the galactic origin of the and absorption lines is _ not _ inconsistent with their velocity centroid listed in table  [ tab : lineresults ] .",
    "there are considerable wavelength uncertainties in both the theoretical calculations and the laboratory measurements of the and lines .",
    "laboratory measurements of the k@xmath0 transition , for example , range from 23.489 to 23.536    @xcite , which is at least partially due to systematic uncertainties in the absolute wavelength calibration , and are probably less accurate than x - ray absorption line observations @xcite .",
    "the mean centroid of the k@xmath0 lines listed in table  [ tab : o7o1 ] is between the letg - hrc measurement of lmc x3 and the mean value obtained by @xcite from a similar analysis of  meg - acis observations of galactic lmxbs .",
    "all these line centroid measurements agree with each other within @xmath110 statistical uncertainties .",
    "it is based on these considerations that we decided to use the mean k@xmath0 line centroid in table  [ tab : o7o1 ] as a reference for the velocity shift in table  [ tab : lineresults ] .",
    "furthermore , lmc x3 has the galactic coordinates of @xmath111 ; the conversion of our measured line - of - sight velocities into values in the local standard of rest or in the galactic standard of rest requires a correction of -13 or -199 @xmath104 , respectively ( assuming a galactic rotation speed of 220 @xmath104 in the solar neighborhood and neglecting the smaller barycenter correction ) .",
    "therefore , the and k@xmath0 line centroids , though with large uncertainties , are consistent with an origin in the local ism .",
    "we may now further constrain the origin of the absorption line from its energy separation from the line .",
    "this relative line separation should be independent of the absolute energy scale accuracy of the observations .",
    "table  [ tab : o7o1 ] shows that the separation @xmath112 m  for the lmc x3 is consistent with the mean value ( @xmath113 m ) for the other sources and is grossly inconsistent with the value ( 1882 m ) if is redshifted to the lmc x3 velocity .",
    "therefore , the absorption line most likley does not originate in the lmc .",
    "of course , the above consideration of the line positions alone can not be conclusive about the exact origin of the absorption line .",
    "the systemic redshift of lmc x3 might be compensated by a blueshift of the absorber .",
    "lmc x3 is an x - ray binary of an unseen primary compact object , which has been interpreted as a 10 - 15 @xmath114 black hole , and a secondary star ( b3 v ) with an orbital period of 1.7 days @xcite .",
    "the x - ray emission is apparently powered by accretion via roche lobe overflow ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "an absorption line produced by a potential accretion disk and/or stellar wind should be broad and blue shifted .",
    "the expected velocity width and shift should be comparable to the escape velocity , on the order of @xmath115 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which is not consistent with our measurement of the line ( table 1 ) .",
    "similarly , one may expect to detect a strong absorption by a wind , probably in its outer regions where the ionization parameter becomes relatively small .",
    "clearly , such a wind scenario is _ inconsistent _ with the constancy , narrowness , and rest - frame velocity of the absorption detected with _ fuse_. in addition , there is no sign for any proximity effect of lmc x3 , an optical nebula or significant absorption by photo - ionized species ( e.g. , @xcite ) , indicating a lack of gas around the x - ray source . we thus tenatively conclude that the as well as the and absorption lines arise in the gas in and/or around the galaxy .",
    "clearly , the inference of the total column density of the x - ray - absorbing gas depends on its absolute metal abundance , which is yet to be determined observationally .",
    "we may use the dispersion measures ( dms ) of pulsars observed in the vicinity of lmc x-3 to estimate the total number of free electrons along the sight - line . among the four known radio pulsars in the lmc , psr j0502 - 6617 and j0529 - 6652 are close to the lmc x-3 sight - line ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lmc_ha ] ) and have the dms of 68.9(@xmath116 ) and 103.2(@xmath116 ) @xmath117 ( 1@xmath72 error bars ; @xcite ) .",
    "the difference in the dms presumably reflects the different contributions of free electrons in the lmc , because both pulsars are projected in regions with significant local h@xmath0 emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lmc_ha ] ) .",
    "in addition , the galactic warm medium is also expected to be a main ( probably dominant ) source of the free electrons .",
    "therefore , we can only get an upper limit to the total hot gas column density from the dms . the lower dm value of j0502 - 6617 ( @xmath111 ) , presumably least contaminated by the warm medium , is only slightly higher ( by a factor of 1.5 ) than that expected from galactic pulsar dms , but is almost same as its highest individual value ( accounting for the galactic latitude dependence , i.e. , sin  @xmath118 ) . from the comparison of our @xmath64 estimate (  3.1 ) with the j0502 - 6617 dm value",
    ", we obtain an oxygen abundance as @xmath119 of the galactic ism value (  1 ) , where @xmath57 is the fraction of the electrons in the hot gas . if our estimate of the warm column density from the   measurement is reasonable (  4.1 ) , i.e. , @xmath120 , the oxygen abundance can then be close to the ism value or even substantially higher .",
    "although various relevant systematics are difficult to quantify here , the lower limit to the oxygen abundance , 16% ( or an o / h number ratio of @xmath121 ) , should be quite firm .",
    "therefore , the hot gas is unlikely to be accreted recently from the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "we may also constrain the ne / o abundance ratio , which is used in the inference of the hot gas parameters .",
    "published x - ray studies are all based on measurements of absorption edges , which are produced primarily by _ cool _ gas .",
    "the neutral ne / o ratio has been determined to be @xmath122 and @xmath123 of the assumed ism value in the sight - lines of the x - ray binaries cygnus  x1 @xcite and x2 @xcite , respectively .",
    "several x - ray binaries indicate unusually high ne / o ratios in x - ray - absorbing gas ( a factor of a few higher ; @xcite ) .",
    "such high ne / o ratios , very difficult to explain in the ism context , are believed to arise from material local to the binaries , which typically show either coronal emission lines or burst behavior . in one occasion ,",
    "the ne / o ratio apparently varies with time @xcite . with the measurements of the line absorption by the highly - ionized species , it is now also possible to measure the relative metal abundances of _ hot _ gas . while we are not aware of such a measurement in publication , a joint analysis of multiple absorption lines observed in the spectra of the x - ray source 4u1820 - 303 without apparent local contamination does indicate a normal ne / o ratio of the x - ray - absorbing hot gas ( yao & wang , in preparation ) .",
    "similarly , if the ratio is allowed to freely vary in our _ absline _ fit of the lmc x-3 x - ray spectrum in  3.1 , we obtain a 95% confidence lower limit of 0.8 times the ism value , or a ne / o elemental number ratio of 0.14 ; the upper limit can not be meaningfully constrained ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chi_ne_o ] ) .",
    "therefore , the ne / o ratio of the hot gas along the lmc x-3 sight - line is consistent with a normal ism value",
    ".    in the _ absline _ fit , the hot gas temperature decreases with the increase of the assumed ne / o ratio value . but @xmath108 ( ) ( or @xmath55 ) hardly changes , because the ionic fraction ( @xmath124 ) is insensitive to the exact value of the temperature in the range of @xmath125 k ( e.g. , yao & wang 2004 ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath56 , especially its most useful lower limit , is insensitive to the ne / o ratio value ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n_vs_b ] ) .",
    "how are the absorbers as observed in the lmc x-3 sight - line related to the general hot ism in the galaxy ?",
    "the two agn sight - lines nearest to lmc x-3 ( ngc  1705 and pks 0558 - 504 ) do show low - velocity absorption features ( 239 and 257 m  respectively , with statistical errors of about 17 m , see wakker et al . 2003 ) , consistent with our above measurement for the lmc x-3 sight - line .",
    "the inferred physical properties of the x - ray - absorbing gas along this sight - line are also comparable to those along the sight - lines away from the diffuse soft x - ray emission enhancement in the galactic central region ( snowden et al .",
    "based on nine similar detections ( mainly k@xmath0 and ne ix k@xmath0 absorption lines ) in the spectra of galactic x - ray binaries and agns , yao & wang ( 2005 ) show that the hot gas column density along the sight - line to lmc x3 is consistent with a global characterization of the hot ism in the galaxy . assuming a disk morphology , the vertical exponential scale height of the hot gas is @xmath126 kpc . compared with the previously measured scale heights of @xmath127 , and @xmath128 kpc for , , , and , respectively ( e.g. , savage et al .",
    "1997 , 2000 ) , the hot gas appears to follow a trend from high to low ionization states away from the galactic plane [ i.e. , the scale height apparently _ increases _ with the decreasing ionization potential of the species @xcite ] .",
    "such an ionization stratification may be understood as a result of a galactic fountain , in which hot gas heated primarily by supernova blastwaves in the galactic disk cools off on the way to the galactic halo @xcite .",
    "a galactic fountain scenario may also explain the nonthermal broadening of the far - uv- and x - ray - absorbing gas (  3 ) .",
    "after the correction for the local standard of rest , the far - uv- and x - ray - absorbing hot gas along the sight - line to lmc x3 seems to have a systemic velocity close to zero , relative to the cold gas in the solar neighborhood ( table 1 ) .",
    "therefore , the hot gas should nearly co - rotate with the stellar ( or cool gas ) disk .",
    "because of the high galactic latitude location of lmc x3 , the line - of - sight velocity of the hot gas should hardly change through the disk with a flat rotation curve in the solar neighborhood . the expected lagging `` halo '' effect , as observed in diffuse cool and warm gases around nearby edge - on disk galaxies ( collins et al .  2002 and references therein ) ,",
    "should be small on scales of the hot gas disk .",
    "therefore , the presence of the nonthermal broadening may suggest a significant vertical velocity gradient of the hot gas , as is expected in a galactic fountain @xcite .    in this galactic fountain scenario , and in the general ism context , and are expected to co - exist globally , though probably not in the exactly same phase .",
    "as an extreme case , we may assume that the observed column all arises in the x - ray - absorbing gas and may then jointly fit the x - ray absorption lines with the line .",
    "this fit gives log@xmath55 , @xmath56 , log@xmath63 , and the ne / o ratio of the absorbing gas as 19.5(19.3 , 19.8 ) , 74(61 , 94 ) , 5.82(5.75 , 5.91 ) , and 3.1(@xmath129 ) , respectively . the temperature obtained here represents the lowest possible limit ; otherwise , the observed absorption should be stronger .",
    "if only a fraction of the observed absorption arises in the x - ray - absorbing gas , the temperature ( ne / o ratio ) would then be greater ( smaller ) .",
    "in general , one needs to consider the possible multi - phase nature of the hot gas .",
    "traces hot gas at the peak of its cooling curve and thus typically represents a very unstable transient phase , as is expected in the cooling hot gas of the galactic fountain and/or at interfaces between hot and cool gases . of course",
    ", the gas could in principle be in a non - cie state , although its effect does not seem to be important for such highly - ionized species as and in a typical ism cooling flow @xcite .",
    "while a comprehensive examination of these potential complications requires data of better quality , the results from the above far - uv and x - ray joint - fit should be used with extreme caution .",
    "the above discussion corroborates the conclusion that the bulk of the highly - ionized gas is located near the milky way , most likely in a thick hot gaseous disk .",
    "the presence of this disk has strong implications for the interpretation of similar @xmath130 absorbers observed in agn spectra .",
    "both the temperature and the line broadening of the hot gas in the lmc x3 sight - line are comparable to those of the absorbers in the agn sight - lines . in the sight - line to mkn 421 ( @xmath131 ) in particular , which is also away from the galactic central x - ray emission enhancement , the inferred vertical gas column density @xmath132 ( yao & wang 2005 ) agrees well with our measurement of @xmath133 in the direction of lmc x3 .",
    "but , the allowed absorbing column density beyond the lmc distance ( @xmath134 ) may still be consistent with the recent prediction of a large - scale ( @xmath135 kpc radius ) , very low density hot gaseous halo around the milky way , resulting from the accretion and cooling of the igm @xcite .",
    "additional contribution to  may also come from larger distances such as the local group , or even from the larger scale local filament ( williams et al .",
    "2005 ; nicastro et al .",
    "furthermore , the hot gas properties might change from one sight - line to another ; a comparison between a couple of sight - lines may not be considered to be conclusive .",
    "a systematic analysis of the existing data as well as sensitive new observations would be very helpful .",
    "we have presented our too  and  spectroscopic observations of the black hole x - ray binary lmc x3 in its high / soft state .",
    "these observations , enhanced by archival  data , allow us for the first time to measure both far - uv and x - ray absorption lines along a 50 kpc sight - line with little extragalactic confusion .",
    "our main results and conclusions are as follows :    * we have detected the absorption lines produced by the  k@xmath0 and  k@xmath0 transitions .",
    "a joint fit of these lines , together with the upper bounds to the  k@xmath1 , and  k@xmath0 lines , gives an  column density of @xmath136 and a velocity dispersion of @xmath137 .",
    "these results are insensitive to the exact ne / o elemental number ratio , to which only a 95% confidence lower limit of 0.14 is determined .",
    "the hot gas , assumed to be in a cie state , has a characteristic temperature in the range of @xmath138 k. * the x - ray - absorbing gas is likely to be primarily galactic in origin .",
    "this conclusion is based on the consistency of both the measured absolute  line centroid and its relative velocity offset from the  line , which should be predominantly galactic .",
    "an origin of the gas in a wind from lmc x3 may also be ruled out by the narrowness and apparent time invariance of the x - ray absorption lines . *",
    "the  spectrum shows a strong ( @xmath139 confidence ) galactic  @xmath140 line absorption ; there might be additional weak ( @xmath98 )  absorption features at lmc velocities ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "the well - resolved galactic absorption corresponds to an  column density of @xmath142 , which is @xmath79 greater than the value expected from the x - ray absorption line modeling .",
    "this discrepancy may indicate a multi - phase state of the absorbing gas .",
    "* we speculate that the highly - ionized absorbing gas represents a supernova - driven galactic fountain , which globally resembles a thick gaseous disk with decreasing ionization away from the galactic plane .",
    "in particular , this galactic fountain scenario naturally explains the significant nonthermal velocity broadening inferred from the direct  line width measurement and from the relative strengths of the x - ray absorption lines .",
    "we further trace the warm gas along the lmc x3 sight - line with our detected  k@xmath0 line . from the x - ray absorption measurements and the galactic ( pulsar ) dispersion measure in the lmc x3 vicinity",
    ", we estimate the oxygen abundance of the x - ray absorbing gas to be @xmath143 of the galactic ism value .",
    "therefore , the x - ray - absorbing gas is metally rich .",
    "* the x - ray absorption lines along the lmc x3 sight - line have properties similar to those of other @xmath130 highly - ionized absorbers observed in the spectra of galactic x - ray binaries and extragalactic agns ( yao & wang 2005 ) .",
    "while there is still room for a significant presence of very low - density diffuse hot gas on scales greater than 50 kpc ( e.g. , the local group ) , any such extragalactic studies of highly - ionized species at @xmath144 must take into account the galactic hot ism component .",

    "<S> the line centroid and its relative shift from the galactic k@xmath0 absorption line , detected in the same observations , are _ inconsistent _ with the systemic velocity of lmc x3 ( @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the far - uv spectrum shows absorption at galactic velocities , but no absorption is detected at the lmc velocity at @xmath6 significance . the measured galactic column density is higher than the value predicted from the -bearing gas , indicating multi - phase absorption . </S>",
    "<S> both the nonthermal broadening and the decreasing scale height with the increasing ionization state further suggest an origin of the highly - ionized gas in a supernova - driven galactic fountain . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we estimate the warm and hot electron column densities from our detected  k@xmath0 line in the lmc x3 x - ray spectra and from the dispersion measure of a pulsar in the lmc vicinity . </S>",
    "<S> we then infer the o / h ratio of the gas to be @xmath7 , consistent with the chemically - enriched galactic fountain scenario . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the galactic hot interstellar medium should in general substantially contribute to zero - redshift x - ray absorption lines in extragalactic sources . </S>"
