    "a hole in this family of results is the extension of @xmath0-crossings and @xmath0-nestings in permutations .",
    "this note fills this gap .",
    "we also give exact enumerative formulas for permutations of size @xmath2 with crossing numbers @xmath3 ( non - crossing ) and @xmath4 .",
    "the _ arc annotated sequence _ associated to the permutation @xmath5 is the directed graph on the vertex set @xmath6 with arc set @xmath7 , drawn in a particular way .",
    "it is also known as the standard representation , or simply , the arc diagram .",
    "it is embedded in the plane by drawing an increasing linear sequence of the vertices , with edges @xmath8 satisfying @xmath9 drawn above the vertices ( the upper arcs ) , and the remaining lower arcs satisfying @xmath10 drawn below .",
    "we refer to this graph as @xmath11 ; the subgraph induced by the upper arcs and @xmath12 is @xmath13 ; and the subgraph induced by the lower arcs and @xmath12 is @xmath14 .",
    "additionally , we reverse the orientation of the arcs in @xmath14 , and view it as a classic arc diagram above the horizon . because of these rules",
    ", the direction of the arcs is determined , and hence we simplify our drawings by not showing arrows on the arcs .",
    "these two subgraphs are arc diagrams in their own right : for example @xmath14 represents a set partition , and @xmath15 is a set partition with some additional loops . for convenience purposes , we draw @xmath16 flipped above the axis , so that it resembles other arc diagrams .    . in this example , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and the degree sequence is given by @xmath19,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] + . in this example , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and the degree sequence is given by @xmath19,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] + . in this example , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and the degree sequence is given by @xmath19,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] +    crossings and nestings are defined for permutations by considering the upper and lower arcs separately .",

    "a nesting is a pair of arcs @xmath23 @xmath24 satisfying @xmath25 ( an upper nesting ) or @xmath26 ( a lower nesting ) .    there is a slight dissymmetry to the treatment of upper and lower arcs in this definition which we shall see is inconsequential .",
    "however , the reader should recall that what is considered a crossing ( nesting ) in the upper diagram is elsewhere called an _ enhanced _ crossing ( resp .",
    "enhanced nesting ) .    crossings and nestings were defined in this way by corteel  @xcite because they represent better known permutation statistics .",
    "corteel s theorem 1 states that the number of top arcs in this representation of a permutation is equal to the number of weak exceedences , the number of arcs on the bottom is the number of descents , each crossing is equivalent to an occurrence of the pattern @xmath27 , and each nesting is an occurrence of the pattern @xmath28 .",
    "corteel s proposition 4 states nestings and crossings occur in equal number across all permutations of length @xmath2 .",
    "to generalize her work we define @xmath0-crossings and @xmath0-nestings in the same spirit as set partitions and matchings . a @xmath0-crossing in a permutation ard diagram @xmath11 is a set of  @xmath0 arcs  @xmath29 that satisfy either the relation @xmath30 ( upper @xmath0-crossing ) or @xmath31 ( lower @xmath0-crossing ) .",

    "we also say @xmath35 is @xmath37-noncrossing .",

    "this has a simple explanation : non - crossing _ partitions _ have long been known to be counted by catalan numbers and there is a simple bijection between non - crossing permutations and non - crossing partitions .",
    "essentially , to go from a non - crossing permutation to a non - crossing partition , flip the arc diagram upside down , convert the loops to fixed points , and then remove the lower arcs .",
    "this defines a unique set partition , and is easy to reverse .",
    "this bijection is easy to formalize , but it is not the main topic of this note .",
    "to get a sense of how theorem 1 is proved , and to obtain some new enumerative results , we consider the set of maximum nestings and crossings . a _",
    "maximum nesting _ is the largest possible : a @xmath4-nesting is maximum in a permutation on  @xmath2 elements .",
    "we can compute @xmath59 explicitly .",
    "the number of permutations with a maximum nesting satisfies the following formula : @xmath60    we divide the result into a few cases , but each one is resolved the same way : for each permutation @xmath5 with a maximum nesting , the @xmath61-nesting comes from either @xmath15 or @xmath14 , and in most cases defines that subgraph .",
    "once one side is fixed , and there is a given degree sequence , it is straightforward to compute the number of ways to place the remaining arcs .",
    "some cases are over counted , and tallying these gives the final result .      to achieve an @xmath63-nesting",
    ", it must be an enhanced nesting in the upper arc diagram , and it uses all vertices , including a loop : @xmath64 .",

    "the lower degree sequence is fixed , and so @xmath67 for each  @xmath54 , but other than that there is no restriction .",
    "thus , there are @xmath68 possibilities .",
    "the even case is slightly more complicated , owing to the fact that three different ways to achieve an @xmath70-nesting :    an @xmath70-nesting in @xmath15 : :    these permutations satisfy @xmath71 .",
    "as before , there are @xmath68 ways to define    @xmath72 .",
    "an @xmath70-nesting in @xmath14 : :    these permutations satisfy @xmath73 .",
    "again , there are @xmath68 possibilities to define    @xmath74 .",
    "only the involution    @xmath75 $ ] is in the intersection of these    sets .",
    "an enhanced @xmath70-nesting in @xmath13 : :    if the @xmath70-nesting uses only @xmath76 vertices ,    there is one left over . it must either be a lower transient vertex , or    a loop since there is nothing left to connect to it .",
    "we count these by    considering the different ways to construct it from a smaller    permutation diagram .",
    "suppose we have a permutation with an    @xmath70-nesting on @xmath76 vertices .",
    "by the first    part , we know there are @xmath77 of these .",
    "we place it on    @xmath78 points , by first selecting our special vertex    @xmath54 , and placing the permutation on the rest .",
    "there are    @xmath78 ways to pick this special vertex . finally , we create    the new permutation @xmath35 by connecting the new vertex    to the rest of the structure .",
    "we choose a point @xmath55 to be    the value @xmath65 .",
    "we can choose @xmath54 and    thus @xmath54 is a loop .",
    "otherwise , @xmath55 must be    before the loop in @xmath79 .",
    "we then set    @xmath80 to be @xmath81 .",
    "there are @xmath70 choices for @xmath65 . over counting",
    ": :    we have counted twice the family of diagrams with two loops in the    center .",
    "there are @xmath77 of these .    putting all of the pieces together , and simplifying the expression",
    "we get the formula : @xmath82    this proof suggests a direct involution on the permutation which switches a maximum nesting for a maximum crossing , since the degree sequence of a nesting and a crossing have the same shape .",
    "thus the formula for maximum crossings is the same .",
    "this involution might send a @xmath0-crossing to a @xmath37-nesting , and so it can not be used for general @xmath0 .      from the formula",
    ", we see that a very smal proportion of permutations have maximum crossings , ( @xmath83 ) or are non - crossing @xmath84 .",
    "what can be said of the nature of the distribution , or the average crossing number ? what is the nature of the generating function @xmath85 where @xmath86 marks the crossing number , or even simply the generating function for @xmath0-noncrossing permutations ?",
    "bousquet - mlou and xin  @xcite consider this question for permutations : 2-noncrossing partitions are counted by catalan numbers , ( as we mentioned before ) , and thus the generating function is algebraic ; the counting sequence for 3-noncrossing partitions is p - recursive , and so the generating function is d - finite , and they conjecture that the generating function for @xmath0-noncrossing partitions , @xmath87 are likely not d - finite .",
    "how can these results be adapted to permutations , given the similar structure ?",
    "the proof of the main theorem first decomposes a permutation into its upper and lower arc diagrams and then applies the results for set partitions separately to each part .",
    "we can apply a result of demier  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.3 ) almost directly to prove our result by describing an involution @xmath88 which preserves the left - right degree sequence and swaps nesting and crossing number .",
    "that is , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "this involution happens on the ferrer s diagram , and is described in detail by krattenthaler  @xcite .",
    "her theorem 3.3 states that any left - right degree sequence @xmath56 , the number of @xmath0- noncrossing graphs on @xmath56 equals the number of @xmath0-nonnesting graphs on @xmath56 .",
    "actually , she proves more : the number of graphs with crossing number @xmath54 and nesting number @xmath55 have a symmetric distribution across all graphs with a given fixed degree sequence .    in order to apply her results ,",
    "the first step is re - write @xmath15 so that we only consider proper crossings and nestings instead of enhanced crossing and nestings .",
    "this is a common trick , known as inflation .",
    "essentially , we create the graph @xmath45 from @xmath15 by adding some supplementary vertices to eliminate loops and transitory vertices : +        now each nesting and crossing is proper , and by  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 3.4 ) @xmath92 and @xmath93 .    in the course of her proof",
    ", she relies on an involution of krattenthaler  @xcite on fillings of ferrer s diagrams .",
    "let @xmath94 be the map on embedded labelled graphs described implicitly in her proof .",
    "because @xmath94 is a left - right degree preserving map , we can identify the supplementary vertices in @xmath95 to get a graph with the correct kind of vertices . call this new graph @xmath96 .",
    "we now extend the definition of @xmath94 to @xmath15 by @xmath97    consider the pair of graphs @xmath98 .    proving our main theorem",
    "now reduces to showing that there is a unique @xmath99 such that @xmath100 , which we do next . for every vertex in @xmath101 the indegree and the outdegree are equal to one",
    "this is because the left - right degree sequence of both the top and the bottom are preserved in the map , and hence the vector sum of their degree sequence is unchanged , i.e. @xmath47 , and has all the correct partial sum properties .",
    "the map is a bijection and so @xmath102 is unique .",
    "this map swaps the upper nesting and the upper crossing number , and also the lower nesting and the lower crossing number .",
    "thus @xmath103 .",
    "thus , the crossing and the nesting number are switched under the map @xmath94 .",
    "set partitions can be viewed as an instance of fillings of ferrer s diagrams , and krattenthaler s involution reduces to the involutions that chen _ et al . _",
    "describe to prove their  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) .",

    "note that @xmath105 , @xmath106.__,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] +      involutions are in bijection with partial matchings , and have thus been previously considered . what of other subclasses of permutations ?",
    "the map presented here does not fix involutions , because loops are mapped to upper transient vertices , but it does fix any class that is closed under degree sequence , for example , permutations with no lower transitory vertices , or permutations with no upper transitory vertices nor loops .",
    "these conditions have interpretations in terms of other permutation statistics , if we consider the initial motivations of corteel .",
    "the main open question , aside from the enumerative , and probabilistic questions we have already raised , is to find a direct permutation description of our involution , i.e. a description avoiding the passage through tableaux or fillings of ferrer s diagrams .",
    "is this involution already part of the vast canon of permutation automorphisms ?",
    "which subclasses of permutations preserve the symmetric distribution ?",
    "from our example , we remark that cycle type is not neccesarily conserved ( since loops are always mapped to upper transitory vertices ) , but non - intersecting intervals are preserved .",
    "involution permutations are in bijection with partial matchings , and so this subclass has this property .",
    "ultimately we have considered a type of graph with two edge colours and strict degree restrictions .",
    "can this be generalized to a larger class of graphs with fewer degree restrictions ?",
    "what of a generalization of graphs with multiple edge colours ?",
    "the authors thank cedric chauve , lily yen , sylvie corteel and eric fusy for useful discussions .",
