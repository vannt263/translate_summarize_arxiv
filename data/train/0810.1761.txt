    "mutually unbiased bases ( mubs ) play an important role in quantum physics .",
    "typically they are constructed from the eigenstates of maximally incompatible properties.@xcite for example , in cases ranging from quantum optics to electronics , the state @xmath4 of a photon polarization or electron spin is often defined by a stokes or bloch vector @xmath5 whose components are the expectation values of the pauli operators : @xmath6 .",
    "the pauli operators @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 are incompatible because , given an eigenstate of any one of them , the outcomes of the others are completely random .",
    "their eigenbases are said to be mutually unbiased . in general ,",
    "two bases @xmath10 and @xmath11 are unbiased when all probabilities between them are equal : @xmath12 with @xmath0 as a normalization constant .",
    "mubs are also manifest in heisenberg s uncertainty principle : a definite momentum @xmath13 implies a random position @xmath14 , corresponding to its wavefunction of equi - modular amplitudes @xmath15    for a discrete system having @xmath0 orthogonal states , or levels , a set of @xmath2 mubs gives a sufficient @xcite and optimal @xcite way to determine its possibly - mixed state @xmath4 .",
    "mubs are thus useful for quantum state tomography .",
    "they also play a role in quantum cryptography , @xcite operator algebras , @xcite and lie algebras.@xcite for a @xmath16-level system , or qubit , the pauli operators provide a useful set of @xmath17 mubs .",
    "more generally , sets of @xmath2 mubs have been constructed for systems whose number of levels @xmath0 is a prime number @xcite or a power of a prime number .",
    "@xcite in any case it is never possible to have more than @xmath2 mubs.@xcite    for a @xmath1-level system , such as a spin-@xmath18 or a qubit - qutrit pair , there is a widespread and ongoing search for sets of mubs.@xcite @xmath1 is the smallest integer that is neither a prime nor a power of a prime , and , despite the qualitative and physical appeal of sets of @xmath2 mubs , no more than @xmath17 mubs have been found @xcite for the @xmath1-level systems .",
    "most searches begin with the classification of unbiased bases represented by hadamards @xcite @xmath19 that are unitary and comprise , in a standard basis @xmath20 , equi - modular elements : @xmath21 the columns of @xmath22 form an orthonormal basis of vectors @xmath23 unbiased with respect to the standard basis ; we are using the term `` unbiased basis '' relative to a standard basis .",
    "quantum mechanics allows a choice of overall phase for each @xmath20 and @xmath24 which we use to fix , in the first row and column , @xmath25 .",
    "any reordering of the standard and unbiased bases vectors ( the permuting of rows and columns in @xmath19 ) is also immaterial .",
    "the classification of these equivalent hadamards is an open question for @xmath26 .",
    "@xcite for @xmath27 the known families of hadamards have up to @xmath16 parameters and are topologically connected ; @xcite it has been conjectured there are @xmath3-dimensional families@xcite which would vastly expand the searchable candidates for sets of mubs .",
    "the conjecture stems from an upper bound , know as the defect , on the dimensionality of any analytic set of hadamards .",
    "@xcite    here we support the conjecture by numerical integration of hadamards of order @xmath1 in @xmath3 directions within the @xmath28-dimensional space of relative phases @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "we do this by taylor - expanding to second order the non - unitarity of @xmath31 matrices of equi - modular elements around known- and found - hadamards .",
    "neighboring hadamards lie nearby in the paraboloid valley of the expansion . apart from tao s matrix ,",
    "@xcite we always find the valley , i.e.  the nullspace of the curvature , to be @xmath3-dimensional , consistent with the defect , although that nullspace can vary from hadamard to hadamard . by taking small steps constrained to the changing nullspace",
    ", we numerically integrate hadamards according to @xmath3 distinct parameters .",
    "a common hadamard is the fourier matrix @xmath32 from which there originate two @xmath16-parameter affine families .",
    "the first fourier family , @xmath33 , has components @xmath34 with @xmath35 and with @xmath36 and @xmath37 setting certain phases according to the affine parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "it is hadamard because it comprises equi - modular elements and is always unitary  its columns are an unbiased basis ( with respect to the standard basis ) .",
    "its transpose @xmath40 , with @xmath41 and @xmath42 taking the ( transposed ) places of @xmath38 and @xmath39 , is the second fourier family .",
    "there are other hadamard families : beauchamp s and nicoara",
    "s @xmath43 @xcite which interpolates from bjrck s circulant matrix @xmath44 @xcite and its conjugate to di s @xmath45 ; @xcite and matolcsi s and szllsi s @xmath46 which connects @xmath47 with @xmath33 and @xmath48.@xcite there is also tao s matrix @xmath49 comprising @xmath17rd roots of unity , @xcite which is disconnected from the rest",
    "all these hadamards are drawn from the matrices of equi - modular elements @xmath50 which we take to be a function on a @xmath28-dimensional phase space , with @xmath51 having the individual phases as components : @xmath52 excluding the @xmath25 in the matrices first row and column .",
    "the difficulty is in choosing the phases to ensure a matrix is unitary .",
    "we therefore define a measure of its non - unitarity as proportional to the sum of the probabilities between non - trivial pairings of its column vectors , @xmath53 which vanishes only when @xmath54 is unitary ( and thus a hadamard ) . taking the inner product @xmath55 and its conjugate in the standard basis",
    ", we find the non - unitarity @xmath56 is a simple function of the relative phases : @xmath57    our methods will rely on taylor - expanding the non - unitarity to second order in small phase shifts @xmath58 as @xmath59 with @xmath60 as the gradient ( slope ) and @xmath61 as the hessian ( curvature ) of the non - unitarity .",
    "the gradient @xmath60 has @xmath28 components",
    "@xmath62 with @xmath63 taking the same argument as before : @xmath64 .",
    "it is subject to the chain rule for differentiation and thus gives rise to the kronecker deltas .",
    "the gradient also vanishes for hadamards because they minimize the non - unitarity .",
    "the @xmath65 components of the hessian @xmath61 are    @xmath66    the hessian is a real symmetic matrix whose eigenvalues give the curvature of @xmath67 in the directions of their corresponding eigenvectors ( principal axes ) .    whenever @xmath51 points to a hadamard , both @xmath56 and @xmath60 are zero . moving away by a small step @xmath58 changes the gradient according to its first order taylor expansion , @xmath68 to preserve unitarity we require no change to @xmath69 ( so that @xmath70 continues to minimize the non - unitarity ) .",
    "we are therefore primarily interested in the nullspace of @xmath61 ( those vectors @xmath71 for which @xmath72 ) .",
    "we calculate numerically @xcite the non - unitarity @xmath56 , gradient @xmath60 , and hessian @xmath61 as functions of @xmath51 ; from @xmath61 we calculate its eigenvalues @xmath73 and eigenvectors @xmath74 .",
    "when @xmath51 points to a hadamard , with the exception of tao s matrix @xmath49 , we always find a @xmath3-dimensional nullspace : four eigenvectors @xmath74 point in directions of effectively - zero curvature , i.e.  they have numerical eigenvalues @xmath75 .",
    "we keep the four eigenvectors @xmath74 that span the nullspace and discard the rest .    from the fourier matrix @xmath76 we already knew of four directions to move away , namely the @xmath77 corresponding to the directions of increasing the parameters @xmath78 of the two @xmath16-parameter fourier families , e.g. @xmath79 although the @xmath77 span the nullspace , they are not all mutually orthogonal or compatible between the two families ; moving a finite distance in the @xmath80 direction , for example , quickly loses the requisite unitarity ; see figure [ evolved23 ] .",
    "the existence of the nullspaces , however , suggests that a series of infinitesimal moves might preserve unitarity .",
    "the problem is that the nullspace changes from hadamard to hadamard so that a direction constrained to the nullspace at one point might depart from the nullspace at another .",
    "we propose to `` feel a way forward '' along an evolving direction @xmath81 obtained by projecting the previous step s direction into the new nullspace : @xmath82 } \\equiv \\sum_{i=1}^4 \\hat{n}_{i[c]}\\;\\hat{n}_{i[c ] } \\cdot \\vec{\\theta}_{[c-1]},\\ ] ] with @xmath83 as a step index .",
    "each step adjusts the relative phases @xmath51 by a length @xmath84 in that direction : @xmath85 } = \\vec{\\phi}_{[c ] } + \\delta \\theta \\ ; \\hat{\\theta}_{[c]}.\\ ] ] at each step we also use newton s method to correct for any higher order drift @xmath86 off the @xmath69 valley floor : @xmath85 } \\rightarrow \\vec{\\phi}_{[c+1 ] } - \\tilde{g}_{[c+1]}/\\tilde{h}_{[c+1]},\\ ] ] with @xmath87 and @xmath88 as the projections of the gradient and hessian outside the nullspace ; at this point we recalculate the hessian and its nullspace .",
    "these corrective steps are small ( never longer than @xmath89 of @xmath90 ) and allow us to take finite , rather than infinitesimal , small steps @xmath91 ( radians ) .    in this way",
    "we numerically integrate a parameterized curve of hadamards through the space of matrices of equi - modular elements . beginning with @xmath51 specifying the fourier matrix @xmath76 , for example , and taking a small step in the @xmath80 direction , for example",
    ", we improve it with newton s method , obtain a new direction from the projection of the previous , take another small step , improve it with newton s method , and so on , progressing a distance @xmath92 while maintaining the unitarity , numerically discovering this curve of hadamards originating from @xmath76 and the initial choice of direction ; see figure [ evolved23 ] .     in the @xmath80 direction , from fourier ; small stepping within the nullspaces improves unitarity by @xmath93 orders of magnitude ( see scatter plot @xmath94 ) .",
    "lower panel : the numerically integrated phase shifts . staying within nullspaces causes a spreading of the phases from their original rates of change @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 . ]",
    "as we integrate curves in this manner , we similarly evolve four directions @xmath98 spanning the evolving nullspace , beginning with , in our example , the four @xmath77 from the two fourier families . in any case",
    ", some initial choice of nullspace spanning vectors @xmath99}$ ] can be made .",
    "then with each small step along a curve we obtain new directions from the previous vectors projections into the new nullspace , @xmath100 } \\equiv \\sum_{j=1}^4 \\hat{n}_{j[c]}\\;\\hat{n}_{j[c ] } \\cdot \\vec{\\theta}_{i[c-1]},\\ ] ] just as we do for the curve s evolving direction @xmath101}$ ] .",

    ", beginning from the fourier matrix and with the @xmath77 giving the four initial directions , we obtain a @xmath3-parameter set of numerically integrated hadamards @xmath108 this is our main result .",
    "the first two parameters specify hadamards within the first fourier family , @xmath109 and the second two parameters then specify hadamards obtained by numerically integrating away from @xmath110 and away from the first fourier family in general ; see figure [ evolved1234 ] .     in the first evolving direction , @xmath105}$ ] ;",
    "then @xmath111 in the second ; @xmath112 in the third ; and @xmath113 in the fourth .",
    "the first two parameters correspond to moving within the first fourier family ; the last two parameters move away from it .",

    "the @xmath1-level system is the smallest @xmath0-level system for which a tomographically complete and efficient set of @xmath2 mubs has not been found ; there is a widespread search for more than @xmath17 .",
    "a complete classification of the complex hadamards of order @xmath1 , representing bases unbiased with respect to a standard basis , would greatly narrow the search .",
    "the previously known families of these hadamards are topologically connected , perhaps by a conjectured @xmath3-parameter family .    here",
    "we prescribe the numerical integration of a @xmath3-parameter set of hadamards within the space of matrices of equi - modular elements .",
    "we taylor expand to second order a measure of their non - unitarity and use the @xmath3-dimensional nullspace of the curvature to choose small steps that preserve the requisite unitarity of the hadamards .",
    "we also update , or evolve , a set of four directions , as we move along a curve of hadamards , by projecting them into the evolving nullspace .    from the fourier matrix @xmath76",
    "we choose four initial directions ( two from the first fourier family and two from its transpose ) and numerically integrate a @xmath3-parameter set of hadamards @xmath115 by integrating , in order of increasing @xmath116 , distances @xmath103 in their corresponding evolving directions @xmath102}$ ] .",
    "these results should facilitate numerical searches for at least @xmath117 mubs in only @xmath118 parameters ( @xmath3 for each candidate mub beyond the standard basis ) .",
