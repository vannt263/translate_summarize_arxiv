    "let @xmath0 be a locally finite covering of the plane @xmath6 by closed unit discs .",
    "the doubly covered region of @xmath6 by @xmath0 consists of the sets of points @xmath7 that are contained in at least two elements of @xmath0 .",
    "a few years ago gabor fejes - tth posed the following question : if @xmath8 are two points at distance @xmath3 apart and contained in the doubly covered region of @xmath6 , what is the length of the shortest path @xmath9 joining @xmath1 and @xmath2 that is completely contained in the doubly covered region ?    in a sense , this is the dual of a problem by laszlo fejes tth about the length of a path avoiding a packing of discs @xcite .",
    "gabor fejes - tth conjectured that when the centres of the circles in @xmath0 form a unit square lattice , the length of @xmath9 is maximal .",
    "for any two points @xmath1 and @xmath2 in this example , @xmath10",
    ". a general upper bound of @xmath11 for @xmath12 is not difficult to obtain .",
    "baggett and bezdek proved in @xcite that when the centres of the circles of @xmath0 form a lattice , then the unit square lattice is indeed the extreme case .",
    "in this short note we give an upper bound for any locally finite covering .",
    "@xmath13    this is still closer to @xmath14 than to @xmath15 , but we hope that our methods may help others to continue improving this bound .",
    "let @xmath16 be the segment joining @xmath1 and @xmath2 and @xmath17 be a minimal sub - cover of @xmath16 .",
    "suppose that @xmath16 is horizontal and that @xmath1 is to the left of @xmath2 .",
    "the elements of @xmath18 can be ordered as @xmath19 such that if @xmath20 then the centre @xmath21 of @xmath22 is to the left of the centre @xmath23 of @xmath24 .",
    "we may assume that @xmath1 is the leftmost point of the intersection of the line @xmath25 with @xmath26 and that @xmath2 is the rightmost point of the intersection of @xmath25 with @xmath27 .",
    "if this were not the case then we may extend the length of @xmath16 by at most @xmath28 and move each one of @xmath1 and @xmath2 through paths of length at most @xmath29 so that they end up in this way .",
    "this contributes a term @xmath30 to the length of the curve we find with respect to the original length of the segment @xmath16 .    since the family @xmath0 is locally finite , every point in the boundary of a circle @xmath31",
    "is doubly covered . for @xmath31 , define @xmath32 as the closure of a connected component of @xmath33 that does not contain the centre of @xmath34 . since @xmath18 is a minimal covering of @xmath16 then @xmath35 if and only if @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath37 and @xmath38 be the points of intersection of the boundary of @xmath22 with @xmath16 such that @xmath37 is to the left of @xmath38 and let @xmath39 be the midpoint of the segment @xmath40 for @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "note that @xmath44 .    .",
    "]    now we construct the path @xmath9 with the algorithm below , an example is shown in figure [ fig : gamma ] .",
    "the path starts at @xmath45 . assuming the path has been constructed up to @xmath39 , let @xmath46 be the largest integer such that the sets @xmath47 are all on the same side of @xmath16 . without loss of generality",
    "we assume they are all above @xmath16 .",
    "the path then continues vertically upwards until it reaches the boundary of @xmath48 .",
    "from here it continues towards the right while staying contained in the boundary of @xmath49 until it is vertically aligned with @xmath50 .",
    "finally it goes vertically downwards until it reaches @xmath50 .",
    "this is repeated until the path ends at @xmath51 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath9 is well defined and completely contained in the doubly covered region , however it is not so easy to directly bound its length .",
    "this path could be shortened by taking diagonal lines instead of vertical ones , but these two paths coincide in the extreme case .    in order to bound the length of this path , for every @xmath52",
    "we construct a new path @xmath53 .",
    "the paths @xmath53 may not be contained in the doubly covered region but they satisfy @xmath54 .",
    "assume for simplicity that @xmath55 is above @xmath16 , then the path @xmath53 starts at @xmath56 , goes upwards until it intersects the boundary of @xmath55 at a point @xmath57 , then goes to the right staying contained in the boundary of @xmath55 until it is vertically aligned with @xmath39 at the point @xmath58 , and finally goes downwards until it reaches @xmath39 .",
    "this path is shown in figure [ fig : gammai ] .",
    "it is not difficult to see that @xmath54 .     and",

    "now it is enough to prove the following .",
    "[ lem : lemma ] @xmath60    we may assume that @xmath61 is the diameter of @xmath22 , otherwise let @xmath32 be a circle with diameter @xmath61 and @xmath59 be the curve defined on @xmath32 in the same way that @xmath53 is defined on @xmath22 .",
    "this new curve clearly has larger length than @xmath53 ( see figure [ fig : gammai ] ) .",
    "let @xmath62 and @xmath63 , then @xmath64 recall also that @xmath65 .",
    "if we fix the value of @xmath66 , then by using lagrange multipliers we obtain that @xmath67 is maximum when @xmath68 , @xmath69 or @xmath70 .",
    "since the cases @xmath68 and @xmath69 are symmetrical , we have essentially two cases . now we only need to determine the maximum of @xmath71 as a function of @xmath72 .",
    "this occurs when @xmath73 and corresponds to the case @xmath70 .",
    "this gives @xmath74 which proves the lemma .",
    "the method we use only considers discs that intersect the segment @xmath25 , we construct a path contained in the boundary of these discs and in their doubly covered region . considering only these circles it is impossible to obtain the bound fejes - tth conjectured .",
    "below we construct an example considering only these circles such that @xmath75 .",
    "let @xmath26 and @xmath76 be intersecting circles and assume @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "if we only allow the path @xmath9 to be in the intersection of the circles and their boundary , then there are only @xmath28 possible choices for @xmath9 .",
    "this is a simplified version of our problem , as the boundary of a circle in @xmath0 is always doubly covered .",
    "but because we only consider two circles , this new problem can be solved precisely to obtain @xmath79 .",
    "here the number @xmath80 is an approximation obtained as the maximum of a function involving trigonometric functions .",
    "the example that gives this value can be extended to families with more circles and have arbitrarily large @xmath3 .",
    "this is done by using several translated copies of this example ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] ) .    .",
    "]    thus , it is essential to consider elements of @xmath81 further away from the segment @xmath25 .",
    "however an improvement on our algorithm would surely lower our bound .",
    "to obtain our bound we consider only @xmath82 discs at a time , this is precisely what is done in lemma [ lem : lemma ] .",
    "a this bound could potentially be lowered if we were to consider @xmath83 or more discs instead .",
    "the algorithm would have to be modified or changed to take advantage of this .",
    "we tried this approach together with alexey garber , however we were unable to obtain any substantial improvements .",
    "a problem we encountered was that the functions to be minimised became extremely complicated ."
