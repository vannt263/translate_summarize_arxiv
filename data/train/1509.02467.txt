    "there is increasing evidence that understanding the evolution of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is crucial for understanding galaxy formation and evolution ( e.g. , ) .",
    "this has driven a rapid growth in attempts to comprehensively characterize the properties and demographics of agns .",
    "the _ spitzer space telescope _ has played a significant role in this effort through the development of mid - ir agn selection methods ( e.g. , @xcite ) and detailed studies of agn spectral energy distributions ( seds ; @xmath4 ) in the near / far - ir ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these studies have expanded further based on the all - sky _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( _ wise _ ; @xcite ) mid - ir survey data ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there is another dimension in which _",
    "spitzer _ can significantly expand its studies of agn demographics and physics , namely the time domain .",
    "agns are variable sources at all wavelengths ( e.g. , ) .",
    "their seds have a minimum near a rest wavelength of 1  and rise towards both the `` blue '' and the `` red '' ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the blue , optical side corresponds to emission from the accretion disk surrounding a super massive black hole at the center of an agn , while the red mid - ir side is due to emission by hot dust ( e.g. , ) as shown by near - ir reverberation mapping studies of nearby agns ( e.g , @xcite ) but also by direct observations of the torus ( @xcite ) . depending on redshift , the 3.64.5  emission probes from near the sed minimum ( @xmath5 ) into the dust - dominated regime ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "we know a great deal about how quasars vary , but we know relatively little about the origins of that variability .",
    "possible origins include accretion disk instabilities , surface temperature fluctuations , or variable heating from coronal x - rays ( e.g. , ) .",
    "the introduction of stochastic process models , particularly the damped random walk ( drw ; @xcite ) , has provided a means to quantitatively describe the variability of increasingly improving ( in length and cadence ) quasar light curves from optical surveys ( such as sdss , @xcite , ogle , @xcite , la silla - quest , @xcite , or crts , @xcite ) or reverberation mapping campaigns ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the drw model is characterized by two parameters , the time scale and amplitude , where the time scale has been tied to either disk orbital or thermal time scales ( @xcite ) .",
    "while it well - describes quasar light curves with a typical cadence of days ( @xcite ) , there appears to be a break in the power spectrum distribution at short times scales observed for highly sampled _ kepler _ agns ( @xcite ) .",
    "sparser light curves for hundreds or thousands of agns are typically analyzed with an ensemble structure function analysis ( e.g. , @xcite ) , commonly described by a single power - law function with the slope index @xmath3 and amplitude @xmath7 at a fixed time scale , although on long time scales there is clearly a break ( @xcite ) .    in @xcite",
    ", we used a structure function analysis to study the ensemble quasar variability of the largest repeatedly observed mid - ir agn sample from the _ spitzer _ deep , wide - field survey .",
    "the survey observed the ndwfs botes field ( ( ra , decl.@xmath814:30 , @xmath934:05 ) ) four times between 2004 and 2008 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is a unique 9  deg@xmath10 area of the sky , far from the galactic plane ( @xmath067  deg ) , that has been observed at many different wavelengths to provide a good census of extragalactic objects .",
    "the agn and galaxy evolution survey ( ages ; @xcite ) provides redshifts for over 23,500 objects .",
    "the noao deep wide - field survey ( ndwfs ; @xcite ) provides deep optical images and photometry in the @xmath11 bands , while the _ spitzer _ deep , wide - field survey ( sdwfs ; @xcite ) provides magnitudes in four mid - ir bands at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 microns .",
    "it was also observed at x - ray ( xbotes ; @xcite ) , at uv by _ galex _ ( @xcite ) at 24  ( mages survey ) , at far - ir by _ herschel space observatory _ ( ) , and radio ( first ; @xcite and wsrt ; @xcite ) wavelengths .    in this paper , we extend our previous analysis using the decadal irac botes survey ( dibs ) , which stretched the time baseline of the survey to 10 years by adding a fifth epoch .",
    "this expansion enables two improvements over our earlier study .",
    "first , the longer temporal baseline provided by the fifth epoch significantly improves the structure function slope measurement , our ability to characterize the differences between optical and mid - ir variability , and to subdivide the sample based on other criteria ( e.g. , x - ray or radio flux ) .",
    "the ensemble quasar variability in mid - ir can be described by a single power - law structure function with the index @xmath12 , hence increasing the time baseline from 4 ( sdwfs ) to 10 years ( dibs ) , typically increases quasar variability by 50% .",
    "second , existing mid - ir agn samples are strongly biased against low luminosity agn and variability provides a means of removing this bias to obtain a more complete census ",
    "the addition of the fifth epoch should improve the completeness and/or purity of the variability selection .",
    "please note , however , that the typical @xmath13 of mid - ir quasar variability is @xmath00.1  mag , which is comparable to the uncertainties provided by dibs or sdwfs for typical sources , hence we detect only significantly variable or brighter quasars .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : data ] , we present the available data and data analysis . in section  [ sec : definitions ] , we introduce the variability measures , while in section  [ sec : results ] , we discuss the results of the quasar selection methods . the structure function analysis is presented in section  [ sec : sfunction ] , and the paper is summarized in section  [ sec : summary ] .",

    "each epoch consists of @xmath020,000 individual @xmath14 pixel irac ( @xcite ) frames that were combined into a single mosaic .",
    "we have re - reduced the original sdwfs images and created new mosaics , each approximately @xmath15 pixels , with a pixel scale of 0.60 arcsec .",
    "these mosaics cover the same area of the sky , but at a different pixel resolution from sdwfs ( @xmath16 pixels and 0.84  arcsec ) .",
    "we used the same photometric catalogs as provided in @xcite . due to the slightly different mosaicing of the fifth epoch and a slightly modified image subtraction procedure ( described below ) , we report the photometric measurements for a total of 514975 objects .",
    "the photometry of our sources was done using difference imaging methods ( e.g. , @xcite ) , where we use the implementation of @xcite .",

    "we then cut them into a slightly overlapping @xmath19 grid of @xmath20 pixel subimages ( with 20 pixel overlaps ) . because the _ spitzer _ point spread function ( psf ) is `` triangular '' with diffraction spikes , we pre - filtered these images to obtain gaussian - like psfs ( see @xcite for details ) , which greatly helps the difference image analysis ( dia ) software obtain clean subtractions and photometry . having the corrected images , we chopped each of them into even smaller @xmath21 grids of @xmath22 pixel chunks ( again with 20 pixels of overlap ) to speed up the dia analysis .",
    "we stacked all five epochs in order to create template images and then use dia to match and subtract the reference images from each individual epoch .",
    "we measured the fluxes of the objects in the sdwfs catalogs on the template image to photometrically align them to the sdwfs catalog .",
    "they were measured using the psf fitting routines from the dia package of @xcite .",

    "if we consider the @xcite sources in `` logarithmic '' bins of @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 , we find @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 , respectively , at 3.6@xmath109 m .",
    "this then implies @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "the results for 4.5  are similar .",
    "we clearly see that the purity of the sample increases with @xmath83 .",
    "the samples with @xmath169 are dominated by contaminants , as expected . while these values of @xmath83 would imply a significant agn component when considering a single object , they are not as significant when used for a sample of objects where only @xmath170 of the sources are agn ( see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the low fraction found for @xmath139 sources suggests that the uncertainties in @xmath148 are dominated by systematic effects ( e.g. , are the ages agn representative ? ) rather than the measurement errors .",
    "the fraction @xmath151 is , of course , a crude statistical estimate and likely subject to a number of systematic effects .      from studies of optical quasar variability , we know that the structure function slopes are shallower at @xmath2 ( @xcite ) than the mid - ir ones reported here . in figure",
    "[ fig : sf_bin ] , we compare the optical and mid - ir structure functions .",
    "it is clear that at short time scales the variability amplitude in the mid - ir is significantly lower than that in optical , and the two match each other only at time - lags of several years .",
    "this is consistent with the wavelength dependent smoothing seen in ngc  2617 ( @xcite ) .",

    "in this paper , we have combined the images from sdwfs with a fifth epoch from dibs , extending the time baseline of the survey to 10 years .",

    "we cross - correlated the dibs variability data with the ages redshift survey , x - ray , mips , radio data , and photometrically selected agn candidates from the same area of the sky . in comparison to sdwfs ,",
    "the variability yields are by 1525% larger for x - ray and 24  quasars , and nearly identical for radio sources exceeding the variability significance @xmath31 .",
    "the yield of variable agns selected from the ages survey seem to be also increased by @xmath020% as compared to sdwfs , while the number of variable stars and galaxies stay the same .",
    "the mid - ir variability selection detects 18% of the known agns from the ages survey . keeping the false positive rates as in sdwfs ( i.e. , lowering the variability significance level used for the dibs sample ) doubles the number of selected variable agns .",
    "the addition of the fifth epoch significantly lowered our estimated false positive rates .",
    "the primary reason for the low overall yields is that quasar variability amplitudes are comparable ( for @xmath70<18 $ ]  mag ) to the photometric quality of the dibs data .",

    "the optical and mid - ir variability amplitudes match each other for time - lags of several years , but for the shorter lags the mid - ir variability amplitudes are significantly lower than the ones in optical .",
    "the lack of short time scale variability can be interpreted as the accretion disk or dust torus smoothing out short - time scale variations .",
    "this is easily understood , as the accretion disk radius is @xmath231  light days for a typical black hole mass of @xmath232 solar masses , radiative efficiency of 0.1 , and eddington ratio of @xmath233 , hence the optical variations originate in a region of 1 light - day in size and the mid - ir ones from a region 25 times bigger .",
