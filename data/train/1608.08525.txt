    "it is common accepted that braking of pulsars is caused by the magneto - dipole radiation of the rotating magnetic star . in this case",
    "the rate of losses of the neutron star rotation energy can be equated to the power of its magneto - dipole radiation : @xmath1 + where _ i _ is the moment of inertia of the neutron star , @xmath2 - the angular speed of its rotation , @xmath3 - its magnetic moment , @xmath0 - the angle between the rotation axis and the magnetic moment , _ c _ - speed of light . for standard parameters of neutron stars : masses of order of the solar mass ( @xmath4 ) and radii _ r _ of order of @xmath5 cm we can put _ i _ = @xmath6 . for the magnetic moment",

    ". , 2005 ) contain as a rule @xmath9 instead of @xmath8 .",
    "here we propose to decline the assumption on the constancy of @xmath13 and use some estimations of this parameter to calculate more accurate values of pulsar magnetic inductions .",
    "in a number of our works ( malov & nikitina , 2011a , b , 2013 ) some methods for calculations of the angle @xmath0 have been put forward and applied to some catalogs of pulsars ( keith et al . , 2010 ; van ommen et al . , 1997 ; weltevrede & johnston , 2008 ) at approximately 10 , 20 and 30 cm .",
    "basic equations for this aim are ( manchester & taylor , 1977 ) : @xmath14    @xmath15     + here @xmath16 is the angle between the line of sight and the rotation axis , @xmath17 - the angular radius of the emission cone , @xmath18 - a half of the angular width of the observed pulse , @xmath19 - the position angle of the linear polarization , @xmath20 - longitude .      the simplest case for the calculations of the angle @xmath0 is realized when the line of sight passes through the center of the emission cone , i.e. @xmath21 + in this case we can use the dependence of the observed pulse width @xmath22 at the @xmath23 level on the rotation period and determine the lower boundary in the corresponding diagram to obtain @xmath24 + as the result we have from ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 7 ) ( malov & nikitina , 2011a ) :    @xmath25     + the values of angles calculated by this method are denoted as @xmath26 and given in the table 1 .",
    "usually polarization measurements are made inside the pulse longitudes only . in this case",
    "we can use the maximal derivative of the position angle . from ( 5 ) we have @xmath27    we can obtain from the dependence of @xmath22 on _ p _ by the least squares method @xmath28 + the third equation for the calculations of the angle @xmath0 is ( 4 ) . from these three equations we obtain @xmath29y^2 + 2c(d - b^2)y+c^2d^2-b^2(1+c^2)=0.\\\\\\ ] ] + here    @xmath30",
    "+ we can transform the equation ( 9 ) to the following form    @xmath31     + then finding the value of y from the equation ( 11 ) we can calculate @xmath0 from ( 13 ) .",
    "we have calculated values of @xmath0 by this method and list them in the table 1 as @xmath32 . here",
    "we correct the misprint in the equation ( 11 ) made in our papers ( malov & nikitina , 2011a , b , 2013 ) .",
    "there is an additional way to calculate angles @xmath0 .",
    "this way uses observable values of position angles and shapes of average profiles for individual pulsars . in this case , original equations form the closed system for calculations of the angles @xmath17 , @xmath16 and @xmath0 :    @xmath33    as the observed pulsar profiles have various forms , the coefficient _",
    "n _ has a different value depending on a profile structure .",
    "we put arbitrary the following values of _ n _ ( fig.1 ) . if the ratio of the intensity @xmath34 in the center of the pulse to the maximal intensity @xmath35 is zero then @xmath36 . for @xmath37 @xmath38 , @xmath39 @xmath40 , @xmath41 @xmath42 , and for @xmath43 @xmath44 .",

    "some other authors ( for example , kuzmin & dagkesamanskaya , 1983 ; kuzmin et al . , 1984 ;",
