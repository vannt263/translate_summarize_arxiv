    "in @xcite , the `` middle part '' of a tree @xmath2 with respect to the number of subtrees ( i.e. the set of vertices contained in most subtrees ) was defined as the _ subtree - core _ of @xmath2 .",
    "it is shown that this set contains one or two adjacent vertices , a fact analogous to those of the _ center _ and _ centroid _ of a tree @xcite .",

    "the bc - subtree - core of the star @xmath133 contains exactly the center vertex .    in general , the bc - subtree - core of a tree needs not contain only adjacent vertices ( unlike in the cases of a path or star ) . in fig . [",

    "[ fig : bccorecounterexam ] , it is obvious that one can not hope for an analogue of proposition  [ prop : sze ] . with the special characteristics of bc - subtrees in mind , it is also interesting to ask the similar question for `` alternative '' vertices on a path .",
    "that is , for consecutive vertices @xmath140 on a path of a tree @xmath2 ( i.e. , @xmath141 ) , is @xmath142 necessarily contained in more bc - subtrees than @xmath143 and @xmath144 ?",

    "the path and star are shown to be extremal with respect to the number of bc - subtrees .",
    "although the results are similar in nature to the previous work , considering bc - subtrees turns out to be less trivial .    regarding the number of subtrees , yan and yeh @xcite illustrated a linear - time algorithm to count the sum of weights of subtrees of @xmath2 by using the method of generating function .",
    "considering the similar question for bc - subtrees would be interesting and natural .",
    "considered as a topological index or graph invariant , the number of bc - subtrees can be studied for other categories of trees such as trees with given degree sequences .",
    "based on the same concept , the `` middle part '' of a tree is defined and named as the bc - subtree - core , analogous to those on subtrees or distance - based invariants .",
    "a brief discussion is provided on this topic , where examples are presented showing that the bc - subtree - core behave in a rather different way than all previously known `` middle parts '' of a tree .",
    "nevertheless , evidences suggest the following :    * knowing that a bc - subtree - core does not necessarily contain adjacent vertices , must a bc - subtree - core ( containing at least two vertices ) contain vertices of distance at most 2 ? * knowing that the subtree - core is not necessarily a subset of the bc - subtree - core , must they be adjacent ( when they contain different vertices ) ?",
    "the first question seems natural considering the special property of bc - subtrees ; the second question is related to one that asks how far different `` middle parts '' can be .    also inspired by the work on subtrees , the extremal trees with respect to the number of leaf - containing bc - subtrees are characterized .",
    "the similar concept on `` middle part '' can also be defined .",
