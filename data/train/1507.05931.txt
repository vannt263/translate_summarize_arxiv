    "the so - called ` teapot effect ' is a daily life phenomenon that will be recognized by everyone . when a liquid is poured too slowly from the ( hydrophilic ) nose of a teapot , a bottle or a beaker , the liquid has the tendency to run down along the underside of the spout , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ teapot - effect]a .",
    "this remarkable effect already received attention in the 1950s  @xcite , and was explained by keller and vanden - broeck as a purely hydrodynamic ( bernoulli ) principle  @xcite .",
    "since there is a difference in flow velocity between the top and bottom of the liquid film , the pressure is lowest directly above the spout lip ; sufficiently low that the flow is pushed further down along the convex solid . in this situation",
    "the liquid film completely ` trickles ' around the solid , and exact potential flow solutions were found in which the edge of the solid was treated as perfectly sharp @xcite . after trickling , a possible separation from the solid could be induced by gravity .",
    "however , one can overcome the trickling scenario by increasing the flow speed , such that the liquid jet or sheet separates from the solid with an angle , as is sketched in fig .",
    "[ teapot - effect]b .",
    "simulations of pouring flows have revealed complicated dynamics , particularly when the reynolds number of the flow becomes of order unity  @xcite",
    ". moreover , duez  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite found that surface wettability controls the flow separation to an unexpected degree , also at large reynolds numbers .",
    "this was also confirmed by recent experiments that aim to develop controlled overflow by surface manipulation  @xcite .",
    "since wettability is determined on a microscopic scale , this highlights the importance of multiple length scales in the problem of pouring flows . in some sense , the experiments and analysis by duez  _ et  al . _",
    "have revealed a relatively simple framework for understanding the various regimes of pouring flow .",
    "the experiments were performed using an axisymmetric set - up that is the top part of the ` liquid bell ' geometry  @xcite , for which the relevant parameters are the flow speed , the wettability of the solid , and the radius of curvature at the edge of the impacter .",
    "the transition between inertia - induced sheet separation and trickling appeared at well - defined weber numbers , whose critical values depend on the contact angle and sharpness of the solid edge . using a scaling argument for the horizontal momentum balance , duez  _ et  al .",
    "_ predicted a dependency on the flow speed of the liquid and the wettability and sharpness of the solid surface , capturing the main experimental trends  though surprisingly , the experimental trends by dong  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite suggest a different dependence on the curvature of the edge ( linear instead of quadratic ) .",
    "the modeling approach has so far been limited to a force balance in the horizontal ( not in the vertical ) direction and it has remained a challenge to explicitly capture the origin of the trickling transition . in addition , it is not clear how these results relate to the analytical potential flow solutions  @xcite , which excluded the effect of surface tension and finite edge - curvature .    in this paper",
    ", we will perform a control volume analysis for inertial pouring flows over a solid edge of finite curvature , by taking into account the capillary forces induced by the shape of the meniscus and the velocity profile within the liquid . by releasing some geometric constraints imposed in  @xcite , this will allow for a force balance in the horizontal _ and _ vertical direction .",
    "the model is solved for varying flow parameters and geometric parameters , and we show how this indeed leads to the appearance of a critical weber number for the trickling transition . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we will introduce the relevant parameters in the problem and the basic assumptions .",
    "this results into a set of coupled equations that provide a prediction for the separation angle .",
    "our main findings will be presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , where we give both numerical and asymptotic predictions for the critical weber number . the results will be summarized and compared to experiments in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "a sketch of the problem and the relevant parameters is given in fig .",
    "[ modifiedsetup]a . like ref .",
    "@xcite , we treat the flow as two - dimensional and define a horizontal @xmath0 direction , and a vertical @xmath1 direction .",
    "we assume a steady , laminar , irrotational flow with high reynolds number . in that case",
    "the flow can be considered uniform both at the inflow above the solid and within the separated sheet , with velocity @xmath2 and the film thickness is @xmath3 .",
    "the edge of the solid has a circular shape , characterized by the radius of curvature @xmath4 .",
    "we assume the sheet separates at an angle @xmath5 with respect to the horizontal direction , and an important part of the analysis is to determine this angle .",
    "the sheet separates from the solid at the position angle @xmath6 defined with respect to the vertical axis .",
    "note that , in general , @xmath7 and we treat these angles as independent parameters . at the separation point , a small capillary meniscus is formed , which has a radius of curvature @xmath8 , which is set by the young - laplace pressure difference over the free surface  @xcite . locally , the circle formed by the meniscus crosses the @xmath4-circle with the contact angle @xmath9 , which is how the surface wettability enters the analysis .",
    "note that @xmath8 is typically much smaller than @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ modifiedsetup ] not drawn to scale ) .",
    "assuming inviscid flow , the introduced parameters can be expressed by three dimensionless control parameters , which are the weber number @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the density and liquid - gas surface tension of the liquid , respectively , the ratio @xmath13 , and the contact angle @xmath9 . for characteristic values around @xmath14 and @xmath15 ,",
    "the weber number for water is of order 1 to 10 .",
    "the corresponding reynolds numbers are about @xmath16 , so we can indeed assume laminar flow and neglect viscosity .",
    "clearly , the formulation presented here closely follows duez  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite , though some notable differences appear .",
    "importantly , we release the geometric constraint that the tangent of the sheet ( with angle @xmath5 with respect to the vertical direction ) , is also a tangent line to the edge of the solid ( i.e. the circle of radius @xmath4 ) . in this manner",
    "we can treat @xmath5 and @xmath6 as two independent parameters , and the momentum balance can be maintained in both @xmath17 and @xmath18 directions .",
    "other minor differences appear below , when estimating the forces acting on the control volume .",
    "we will solve the deflection angle @xmath5 of the liquid sheet as the result of the hydrodynamic and capillary forces using linear momentum conservation .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the liquid sheet bending is that the velocity profile over the curved solid is not uniform , contrarily to the inflow and the outflow of the control volume indicated in fig .",
    "[ modifiedsetup ] .",
    "this velocity profile implies a pressure difference across the film , which induces a hydrodynamic force , @xmath19 , exerted by the solid on the liquid , pulling the liquid along the curved edge .",
    "this is sometimes referred to as the coanda effect  @xcite .",
    "the resultant capillary force in the small meniscus is denoted as @xmath20 , while the effect of surface tension over the top of the curved sheet yields @xmath21 .",
    "importantly , we can define the cv in two ways , indicated by fig .",
    "[ modifiedsetup]a and b , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ modifiedsetup]a , the control surface ( cs ) , is located just _ inside _ the liquid ; in fig .  [ modifiedsetup]b the cs is located just _ outside _ the liquid . in the first case",
    ", the capillary force can be evaluated by integrating the young - laplace pressure over the control surfaces ; in the second case , there is no normal force working on these surfaces , but the surface tension acts parallel on the edge of the liquid domain .",
    "both points of view of course result into the same final equations and the resultant forces are indicated by the arrows in fig .",
    "[ modifiedsetup]b .",
    "the resulting momentum balance for the @xmath22 direction reads    @xmath23    while for the @xmath24 direction we have :    @xmath25    here we used that the control volume ( cv ) contains the full bending of the stream , such that the left and right boundary of the cv are located where the flow is uniform .",
    "it is instructive to consider the momentum balance in the context of the exact solutions by keller  &  vanden - broeck  @xcite .",
    "these are obtained by treating the solid as a perfectly sharp edge in the absence of capillary effects .",
    "this effectively corresponds to @xmath26 , @xmath27 , while the angles @xmath9 and @xmath6 are not defined in this limit .",
    "it was found that analytical solutions exist for each value of @xmath5 ; one could use the momentum balance ( [ forbalx],[forbaly ] ) without the capillary forces ( @xmath28 ) to determine the dynamical force @xmath19 , for each value of @xmath5 .",
    "importantly , however , this analysis does not lead to a selection of @xmath5 .",
    "a selection of @xmath5 does appear at finite values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , one thus needs explicit expressions for all terms in sys .",

    "we require the velocity profile inside the flowing liquid , for a given geometry characterized by @xmath30 . here ,",
    "we focus on the case @xmath31 for which the flow will evolve towards concentric ` circular ' streamlines around the circular edge of the solid  @xcite . under the assumption of potential flow , this corresponds to a free vortex with a tangential flow velocity @xmath32 .",
    "such a profile is quite different from the corner solutions for @xmath33 , and the resulting pressure distribution is expected to be quite different .",
    "we therefore verified the @xmath34 profiles for an experimentally relevant case , @xmath35 , using potential flow simulations using an axisymmetric boundary integral ( bi ) routine  @xcite .",
    "we solve the laplace equation @xmath36 for the flow potential @xmath37 in the domain indicated in fig .",
    "[ streamprofiles]a , containing a small inlet region before the circular bend , ending with a separated sheet . in the simulations",
    "the contact line is pinned at a fixed position angle @xmath6 .",
    "note that the bi simulations are only used for the confirmation of the presumed velocity profile  we have not succeeded in creating perfectly steady sheets in the simulations , except for trivial solutions .",
