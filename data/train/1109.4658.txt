    "a detailed description of the instrument can be found in @xcite .",
    "here we analyzed _ fermi _ lat data taken for 30 months , from 2008 august 4 to 2011 february 8 .",
    "the data analysis was performed using the standard analysis software package , the lat science tools v9r21p0 .",
    "we selected `` diffuse class '' events , which are those reconstructed with high probability of being photons and are recommended for standard point - source analyses . in the analysis ,",
    "the instrumental response functions ( irfs ) `` pass6 v11 '' were used . to reduce the background from the earth limb @xcite , events with earth zenith angle greater than @xmath12 were eliminated .",

    "the spectrum of the vela pulsar is represented with a power law with an exponential cutoff , whose parameters ( normalization , index , and cutoff energy ) are also treated as free parameters . to the spectrum of the galactic diffuse model , a power - law function was multiplied in order to allow for any energy - dependent discrepancy between the model and data .",

    "one is the so - called hadronic scenario in which gamma rays are dominantly radiated through decays of @xmath8 mesons produced in collisions between accelerated protons / nuclei and ambient gas .",
    "the other is the leptonic scenario in which inverse compton scattering of relativistic electrons with photon fields such as the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is the main emission mechanism for gamma rays .",

    "the equations are solved for @xmath47  yr , and then photon spectra from electrons and protons are computed for each radiation process .",
    "the distance to the snr is assumed to be @xmath48  pc @xcite . as the seed photons for inverse compton scattering , we considered the cmb as well as the interstellar radiation field in infrared and optical bands .",
    "the spectrum of the interstellar radiation is taken from galprop @xcite at the location of the snr .",
    "figure  [ fig : modeling ] ( a ) shows the hadronic model together with radio , x - ray , and gamma - ray data .",
    "the parameters adopted for the calculation are summarized in table  [ tab : model_param ] .",
    "the indices of proton and electron spectra are assumed to be the same .",
    "for the model curves in figure  [ fig : modeling ] ( a ) , the proton spectrum has an index of @xmath49 and a high - energy cutoff at @xmath50 . in this case , the total kinetic energy of protons above 10  mev is @xmath51  erg , where @xmath52 denotes the hydrogen gas density in the post - shock region .",
    "the synchrotron spectrum from electrons with the same index @xmath53 is consistent with the radio spectral index @xmath54 deduced from the two flux points in figure  [ fig : modeling ] @xcite . note that the synchrotron spectrum index and electron index are related as @xmath55 .",
    "the flux of the synchrotron component is controlled by the amount of electrons and the magnetic field strength .",
    "the stronger the magnetic field is , the larger the number of electrons should be , and the inverse compton flux becomes higher . in the hadronic scenario ,",
    "the magnetic field should be at least @xmath56 so that inverse compton scattering becomes negligible in the gev - to - tev domain . in the case of @xmath57",
    "adopted here , the total kinetic energy of electrons becomes @xmath58  erg , and the ratio of injected particle numbers at @xmath59 is @xmath60 .    in the case of the leptonic scenario ,",
    "the electron index is constrained by the _ fermi _",
    "lat spectrum .",
    "considering inverse compton scattering in the thomson regime , the photon index and electron index are related as @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , the observed photon index @xmath61 leads to a soft electron spectrum with @xmath62 .",
    "with this index , however , the synchrotron spectrum can not fit the radio and x - ray data well .",
    "we then adopted a harder electron spectrum within the range allowed by the statistical and systematic errors in the _ fermi _ lat spectral points .",
    "the model curves in figure  [ fig : modeling ] ( b ) are the leptonic models when the electron index is @xmath63 with a high - energy cutoff at @xmath64 .",
    "the magnetic field strength can be determined as @xmath65 so that the synchrotron to inverse compton flux ratio matches the data .",
    "electron bremsstrahlung emission is calculated to be @xmath66 at 10  gev .",
    "both models face difficulty .",
    "the leptonic model requires a weak magnetic field of order @xmath67 , which may be contradicted by observations .",
    "the width of the filaments in the shell observed in _",
    "chandra _ gives a magnetic field estimate of @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "these results are interpreted as evidence for magnetic field amplification by streaming of accelerated cosmic rays .",
    "however , it is possible to reconcile a high magnetic field with the leptonic model if gev gamma rays are radiated not only from the filamentary structures seen by _",
    "chandra _ , but also from other regions in the snr where the magnetic field may be weaker .",
    "the hadronic model requires an unrealistically large energy of protons if the gas density is as small as @xmath69 .",
    "thermal x - ray emission works as a probe to estimate the gas density .",
    "however , no clear detection is reported so far mainly because it is difficult to separate emission from rx  j0852.0@xmath04622 and the vela snr , which overlaps and emits strong thermal emission in the soft x - ray band . using _",
    "asca _ data ,",
    "@xcite placed an upper limit of @xmath70 , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the distance to rx  j0852.0@xmath04622 and the filling factor of a sphere taken as the emitting volume in the region used for their spectral analysis , respectively . in the case of @xmath73 , which corresponds to rather thick shell width",
    ", the upper limit becomes problematic since @xmath74 reaches @xmath75  erg , which means that almost all the kinetic energy released by the supernova explosion must go to accelerated protons .",
    "the proton index @xmath49 for the hadronic scenario is somewhat harder than @xmath76 expected in the test - particle regime of diffusive shock acceleration with a strong shock .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to compare the observed spectrum with models based on diffusive shock acceleration in the nonlinear regime .",
    "@xcite has calculated the broadband sed of rx  j0852.0@xmath04622 with their time - dependent , nonlinear kinetic theory for cosmic - ray acceleration .",
    "their model curve is plotted over the gev - to - tev data in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "the _ fermi _ lat spectrum appears harder than the model by @xcite , but the discrepancy is not large compared to the systematic errors .",
    "it is of interest to compare the gamma - ray spectrum of rx  j0852.0@xmath04622 with that of the similar object , rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 @xcite .",
    "the two snrs have roughly the same age , size , and similar radio , x - ray and tev gamma - ray spectra . the _ fermi _ lat spectrum of rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 has a photon index of @xmath77 , which is more preferable for leptonic models than hadronic models @xcite . in the case of rx  j0852.0@xmath04622 , a leptonic origin is not favored but can not be ruled out .",
    "the difference between the two similar objects could be an important point to be further explored to probe gamma - ray production in snrs .",
    "further studies of _ fermi _ lat data in the future , particularly better modeling of the galactic diffuse emission , will reduce the uncertainties and will allow us to probe particle acceleration in the snr in greater detail .",
    "the _ fermi _ lat collaboration acknowledges support from a number of agencies and institutes for both development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",
    "these include nasa and doe in the united states , cea / irfu and in2p3/cnrs in france , asi and infn in italy , mext , kek , and jaxa in japan , and the k.  a.  wallenberg foundation , the swedish research council and the national space board in sweden . additional support from inaf in italy and cnes in france for science analysis during the operations phase is also gratefully acknowledged ."
