    "the boundary stabilization of the system ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) has been the object of a considerable mathematical research .",
    "there are two categories of research articles : in the first category , at least one of the dynamical terms in the boundary conditions is neglected . in other words , either @xmath19 or @xmath20 does not appear in the system or even both terms are not present .",
    "for instance , it has been shown in @xcite that the feedback law @xmath21 exponentially stabilizes the system ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) with @xmath22 under appropriate assumptions on the function @xmath23 . another stabilization result for the system ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) with @xmath24 has also been established in @xcite via the action of the following feedback : @xmath16{l}{\\mathcal{f}}(t)=-\\alpha y(0,t)-f(y_{t}(0,t)),\\\\ { \\mathcal{u}}(t)=-\\alpha y(1,t)-f(y_{t}(1,t)),\\;\\;\\alpha>0 , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is an additional control to be applied on the load mass . in @xcite ,",
    "the asymptotic stabilization has been proved as long as a dynamical control is acting on the boundary @xmath26 .",
    "we also mention that a stabilization result has been obtained in @xcite by proposing the feedback law @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 is a function in @xmath30 .",
    "of course , such a result has been established under some conditions on the feedback gains @xmath31 as well as the function @xmath29 .",
    "similar findings have been obtained in @xcite for other types of controls containing a displacement term .",
    "we conclude this discussion about the first category of articles available in the literature by pointing out that it has been noticed in @xcite that in all references cited above , either the boundary conditions in ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) or the stabilizing feedback law @xmath12 involves the displacement term @xmath32 .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that most of the authors defined the energy - norm of the system by @xmath33 this observation has motivated the authors in @xcite to consider a displacement term in the equation and propose a general class of feedback law containing only the velocity .",
    "in fact , the closed - loop system in @xcite has the following form @xmath16{ll}y_{tt}(x , t)-\\left (   ay_{x}\\right )   _ { x}(x , t)+\\alpha y_{t}(x , t)+\\beta y(x , t)=0,\\;\\;\\alpha\\geq0,\\;\\beta>0 , & 0<x<1,\\;t>0,\\\\ \\left (   ay_{x}\\right )   ( 0,t)=\\epsilon_{1}f(y_{t}(0,t ) ) , & t>0,\\\\ \\left (   ay_{x}\\right )   ( 1,t)=\\epsilon_{2}g(y_{t}(1,t ) ) , & t>0,\\label{(1.6)}\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] in which @xmath34 and @xmath35 are two nonlinear functions .",
    "the multiplier method has been successfully used in @xcite to get precise decay rate ( polynomial or exponential ) estimates of the energy of the system ( [ ( 1.6 ) ] ) according to the type of assumptions on the functions @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "recently , the back - stepping approach has been successfully applied to a variant of the system ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) leading to an exponentially stabilizing boundary feedback controller @xcite . in the same spirit , the following feedback law @xmath16{l}{\\mathcal{f}}(t)=-\\alpha_{1}y(0,t)-\\beta_{1}y_{t}(0,t),\\\\ { \\mathcal{u}}(t)=-\\alpha_{2}y(1,t)-\\beta_{2}y_{t}(1,t ) , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] has been suggested in @xcite in the case where @xmath36 and @xmath24 and the riesz basis property has been shown .",
    "the second category of research papers takes into consideration the dynamics of both the load mass and platform mass . within this context",
    ", it has been proved in @xcite that the system ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) can be strongly ( but non - uniformly ) stabilized by means of the control @xmath37 where @xmath34 is a suitable function .",
    "this motivated several authors to propose controls of higher orders to reach the uniform exponential stability .",
    "indeed , the uniform stabilization holds if @xmath38 it turned out that the same result result can be achieved by the control @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are positive constants satisfying @xmath42 motivated by the work of @xcite , a feedback control depending only on the velocity has been proposed in @xcite for the system ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) and an asymptotic convergence result has been established ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "all the papers mentioned above do not take into consideration time - delay . in turn , it is well - known that delays are inevitable in practice as they naturally arises in most systems due to the time factor needed for the communication among the controllers , the sensors and the actuators of systems or in some cases due to the dependence of the state variables on past states .",
    "furthermore , it has been noticed that the presence of a delay in a system could be a source of poor performance and instability @xcite-@xcite ( see also @xcite@xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the present work places primary emphasis on the analysis of the system ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) under the action of the following input delay @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the time - delay .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the absence of the displacement term in the closed - loop system prevents the applicability of classical poincar inequalities . to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "an appropriate energy - norm is suggested .",
    "the main contribution of the present work is threefold :    1 .",
    "extend the mathematical findings on the overhead crane available in literature ( specially those of @xcite ) , where no delay has been taken into account in the feedback laws .",
    "2 .   show that despite the presence of the delay term in the proposed feedback control law , the closed - loop system possesses the asymptotic convergence property of its solutions to an equilibrium state which depends on the initial conditions .",
    "3 .   provide the rate of convergence of solutions of the closed - loop system to the equilibrium state , in contrast to the work @xcite where such a result has not been achieved .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section is devoted to the proof of existence and uniqueness of the solutions to the closed - loop system .",
    "section [ sect3 ] deals with the asymptotic behavior of solutions via the use of lasalle s principle .",
    "section [ sect4 ] is devoted to the polynomial convergence of solutions .",
