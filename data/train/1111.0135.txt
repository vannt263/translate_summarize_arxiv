    "key properties of physical systems can sometimes be understood by mapping them to seemingly unrelated ones .",
    "a powerful example of this was provided by laughlin , who observed that the squared norm of his @xmath0 fractional quantum hall trial wavefunction @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is a complex coordinate in the two - dimensional plane ) could be expressed as the boltzmann weight of a two - dimensional one - component plasma  @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "this mapping allows properties such as quasiparticle charge and braiding statistics to be determined by appealing to the known properties of a one - component plasma .",

    "note that @xmath14 is the 2d coulomb potential of the usual two - component plasma ( where the two species carry charge @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively ) .",
    "the @xmath8-particles carry charge @xmath17 for the first interaction and charge @xmath15 for the second interaction .",
    "the @xmath7-particles carry charge @xmath18 for the first interaction and charge @xmath16 for the second interaction . for a plasma with @xmath19 particles of each species ,",
    "neutrality is satisfied using a uniform background density of type 1 charge , as in the second term in eq .  .",
    "this unconventional plasma may be considered as an ordinary neutral two - component gas with positive and negative charges of magnitude @xmath15 , where the positive charges are given an additional charge of @xmath17 that is only felt by the other positive charges and not the negative charges .",

    "we are thus led to consider a class of unconventional plasmas parametrized by @xmath20 and @xmath21 . as mentioned above , for mr ising - type states with filling @xmath0 ,",
    "the relevant values are @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in this plasma mapping ,",
    "the @xmath24 particles in the plasma correspond to the electrons in the mr wavefunctions and the @xmath13 particles correspond to screening operators ( fictitious particles ) .",

    ", a `` screening phase '' means that the system has a screening length which is finite , and exponentially decaying effective interactions .",
    "a system with logarithmic effective interactions is one where screening is defined to be absent . as a first check , we reproduce the well - known result that , for @xmath29 , there is a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) phase transition at @xmath30 , as expected for a 2d two - component plasma of equal and opposite charges . for @xmath31 ,",
    "the charges are unbound and the plasma screens , but for @xmath32 , the charges are bound into dipoles and the interaction is not screened .",
    "thus , for @xmath33 , the value relevant to 2d chiral @xmath26-wave superconductors , the plasma screens . for @xmath34 , we again find a bkt phase transition at @xmath30 , with a plasma screening phase for @xmath31 .",
    "the first coulomb - like interaction is deep within its screening phase and appears to have a negligibly small effect on the screening of the second interaction . in both cases , the critical values @xmath35 are obtained by a finite - size scaling fit of the monte carlo data to the bkt form .",
    "our findings demonstrate that the unconventional plasma which occurs in the mapping for both a chiral @xmath26-wave superconductor and the ising - type quantum hall states is clearly in the screening phase ( for both types of coulomb interaction ) and hence allows one to discern the non - abelian braiding properties of these states , as explained in ref .  .",

    ", this background is a uniform negatively charged 2d disk with charge density @xmath45 , where @xmath46 , that yields @xmath47 the particle - background and the background - background interaction also yields uninteresting constant terms , that are disregarded in eq .  .",
    "we note that when @xmath29 we have the 2d two - component neutral coulomb plasma , which is well - studied both analytically and numerically  @xcite . at low dipole density",
    ", this system will undergo a bkt transition , which is a charge - unbinding transition from a low - temperature state where charges of opposite signs form tightly bound dipoles to a high - temperature state in which a finite fraction of charges are not bound in dipoles , but rather form a metallic state . in the low - temperature phase , this coulomb gas is an insulator and the dielectric constant @xmath48 ( see for instance refs .   and",

    ", the existence of free charges , yields a conductive gas with an infinite value of @xmath48 . at the critical temperature @xmath49 ,",
    "when tightly bound dipoles starts to unbind , there is a universal jump in the inverse dielectric constant from a non - zero value in the insulating phase to zero in the metallic phase , @xmath50 the screening properties that follow are that the coulomb gas is able to perfectly screen test charges in the metallic phase when there are free charges in the system , whereas there is no screening in the insulating dielectric phase . in this work , we will focus our attention on the low dipole density regime , so we will not go into details of the physics in the 2d two - component neutral coulomb gas at higher densities .",
    "however , we note that when density is increased , the critical point of the bkt transition is shifted towards lower temperatures  @xcite .",
    "another well - studied case is when @xmath51 , for which the model reduces to the 2d one - component plasma ( for the @xmath8-particles only ) .",
    "early numerical studies of this system found a weak first - order melting transition at @xmath52 from a state where the charges form a triangular lattice with quasi - long - range translational and long - range orientational order to a fluid plasma state  @xcite .",
    "these results were , in a sense , contrasting with the defect - mediated melting theory of kosterlitz - thouless - halperin - nelson - young ( kthny ) that predicts melting from a solid to a liquid via two bkt - transitions and an intermediate hexatic phase with no translational order and quasi - long - range orientational order  @xcite . other studies of 2d melting point in favor of the kthny theory  @xcite , suggesting that the nature of melting transition may depend on details in the interatomic potential , or that finite - size effects and lack of equilibration might lead to erroneous conclusions in earlier works .",
    "there are also studies that argue for the absence of a phase transition to a low - temperature solid phase in the 2d one - component plasma with repulsive logarithmic interactions because the crystalline state would be unstable to proliferation of screened disclinations for any @xmath53  @xcite .",
    "the unconventional 2d two - component plasma studied here is mapped to inner products of trial wavefunctions for the mr quantum hall states using conformal field theory ( cft ) methods , as explained in ref .  .",
    "in particular , this mapping utilizes the coulomb gas description of cfts  @xcite together with a procedure for replacing holomorphic - antiholomorphic pairs of contour integrals in screening charge operators for 2d integrals  @xcite .",
    "the mr states wavefunctions can be written as a product of correlation functions of fields from the ising and u(1 ) cfts . in particular",
    ", the mr ground - state wavefunction for @xmath19 electrons is @xmath54 where the pfaffian of an antisymmetric matrix @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 here , @xmath57 is the symmetric group , @xmath58 is one of the permutation elements in @xmath57 , and @xmath59 is the signature of @xmath58 .",
    "the @xmath60 portion of this wavefunction is produced from the correlation function of @xmath61 fields in the ising cft , while the laughlin - type portion @xmath62 is produced from the correlation function of vertex operators in the u(1 ) cft .",
    "the laughlin - type portion of the mr wavefunctions can be mapped to charges of type 1 , similar to laughlin s plasma mapping .",
    "the mentioned cft methods provide identities such as @xmath63 which allow the pfaffian portion of the mr wavefunctions to be mapped to charges of type 2 .",

    "( [ eqn : two - coulomb - ints ] ) @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath33 .",
    "more generally , one can also construct a similar , but more complicated mapping between inner products of wavefunctions of the mr states with quasiparticles , as explained in ref .  .",
    "in this case , the quasiparticles map to fixed `` test '' objects in the plasma that carry electric charge of type 1 and can carry both electric and magnetic charges of type 2 ( and also changes the number of screening operators , i.e. @xmath7-particles in the plasma , to maintain neutrality ) .

    "( [ eq : norm ] ) as long as the probability for @xmath8-particles and @xmath7-particles to sit right on top of each other has measure zero .",
    "as we will see in this paper , this is true for @xmath72 , in which case the configurational entropy to be gained by having @xmath8-particles and @xmath7-particles separate overcomes the energy gained by having them on top of each other .",
    "we refer to this as an `` entropic barrier '' for putting @xmath8-particles and @xmath7-particles on top of each other .",

    "least - squares curve fitting of the monte - carlo results for @xmath127 to eq .   may be performed with both @xmath261 and @xmath156 as free parameters  @xcite . if the transition is of the bkt - type , a good fit to eq .",

    "in addition , when @xmath261 is free , no _ a priori _ assumption on the value of the universal jump is made , thus a resulting value of @xmath261 that corresponds to the universal jump of the bkt - transition should be obtained . however , with two free parameters , higher quality of the monte - carlo statistics is required to single out when they system is closely obeying the behavior of eq .  .",
    "we have employed the marquardt - levenberg algorithm minimizing @xmath262 to the nonlinear fitting function in eq .  .",
