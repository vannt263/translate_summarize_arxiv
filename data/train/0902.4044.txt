    "despite the numerous extrasolar planets discovered over the last decade , the fate of these systems during the final stages of the parent star s evolution is still uncertain . a clue to their destiny",
    "was discovered during a search for cool companions to white dwarfs .",
    "g2938 was found to display a strong near - infrared excess @xcite , but deep imaging and asteroseismological studies of the system ruled out the presence of a brown dwarf companion .",
    "mid - infrared photometry showed that this excess is even more pronounced at 10 @xmath1 m suggesting that the emission is due to dust around the white dwarf @xcite . _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "observations spectroscopically confirmed the presence of circumstellar dust around g2938 @xcite , which has since been modelled as a flat , opaque , circumstellar disk @xcite .",
    "the atmosphere of g2938 has been found to be enriched with metals , implying that the star is currently accreting @xcite , probably from this dusty disk .",
    "the more likely origin for the disk is the tidal disruption of either comets or asteroids @xcite , with asteroids the more probable candidates , as they can explain the large amount of metals accreted by the white dwarfs .",
    "comets are also dynamically less favourable , given their eccentric orbits and long orbital periods .",
    "the approach used by @xcite to model the disk was based on a simple , optically thick , geometrically thin dusty disk model described in @xcite .",
    "a further 11 white dwarfs have been found to display a similar infrared excess @xcite , most of which are cool , metal - rich daz white dwarfs , with effective temperatures @xmath2 15000k ( with the exceptions of pg1015 + 161 , which has @xmath319300k , and pg1457 - 086 with @xmath3 20400k ) , leading @xcite to suggest that dusty disks around white dwarfs should be sublimated for @xmath4 16000  20000k .",
    "more recently , @xcite identified three more moderately hot white dwarfs showing double - peaked calcium lines indicative of a rotating circumstellar debris disk - sdssj122859.93 + 104032.9 ( hereafter sdss1228 + 1040 ) , sdssj104341.53 + 085558.2 and sdssj084539.17 + 225728.0 .    here",
    "we report the detection of a significant infrared excess in one of these systems , sdss1228 + 1040 .",
    "the white dwarf was identified by @xcite in data release 6 of the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "@xcite noted very unusual emission lines of the ca ii 850 - 866 nm triplet , as well as weaker emission lines of fe ii at 502 nm and 517 nm .",
    "the line profiles of the ca ii triplet display a double - peaked morphology , indicative of a gaseous , rotating disk structure .",
    "time - resolved spectroscopy ruled out any significant radial velocity variations , and the absence of balmer and helium emission lines implied that the gaseous disk around the white dwarf must be extremely deficient in volatile materials , ruling out the presence of a stellar binary companion .",
    "the velocity of the ca ii line peaks indicate that the outer radius of the gaseous circumstellar disk is @xmath5r@xmath6 .",
    "we were awarded 2.4 hours of _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "time in cycle-4 ( p40048 ) , plus 3.0 hours in cycle-5 ( p50118 ) to search for a dusty component to the gaseous circumstellar disk around sdss1228 + 1040 ( see table[table : observations ] for a full list of observations ) .",
    "we obtained infrared array camera ( irac ; * ? ? ? * ) data in all four channels ( 3.6  8.0 @xmath1 m ) , infrared spectrograph ( irs ; * ? ? ? * ) blue peak - up imaging at 16@xmath1 m , and multiband imaging photometer ( mips ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) imaging at 24@xmath1 m .",
    "the irac data reduction was carried out on the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) frames as follows .",
    "we corrected all of the bcds for array - location - dependence using the corresponding correction frames provided by the spitzer science center ( ssc ) .",
    "these were applied after uncorrecting the array - location - dependence frames for pixel distortion in order to prevent a repeat correction for pixel distortion when creating the mosaic .",
    "the array - location - corrected bcds were then all combined using the standard ssc software , mopex ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mosaicker and point source extraction ) with dual - outlier rejection to create a single mosaicked image for each channel .",
    "the mosaic pixel scales were set to the default 1.22/pix . as a check on our reduction method , we also split the bcds into batches of 7 frames , creating a mosaic from each batch in order to enable us to test the repeatability of the photometry and calculate an independent estimate of our uncertainties .",
    "the irs peak - up imaging frames were combined in much the same way , using mopex to combine the bcds with dual - outlier rejection .",
    "again , we created a mosaic from both the entire data set , and from sub - sets of the data , so that we could test the repeatability of the photometry and derive realistic photometric uncertainties from our data .",
    "the pixel scales for the mosaics were set to the default 1.8/pix .",
    "a similar method was applied to the mips data , where we created a separate mosaic for each of the exposure i d sets ( 35 bcds in each set ) .",
    "this gave us 21 mosaics in total , all of which were created using multiframe temporal outlier rejection and the default pixel scale of 2.45/pix .",
    "the mosaicked images for all of the _ spitzer _ data , with sdss1228 + 1040 marked , can be found in figure[fig : montage ] .",
    "we carried out aperture photometry on our irac and irs pu mosaics using iraf , using apertures of 3.0 pixels for the irac mosaics and 2.0 pixels for the irs mosaics .",
    "the sky subtraction was applied using an annulus of 1020 pixels in radius . in irac channels 1 and 2",
    "there were background sources included in the sky annuli .",
    "iraf rejects bright pixels in the sky annuli , but we carried out a double - check of the sky levels using nearby apertures , and found them to be virtually identical to the levels originally measured .",
    "the photometry was then converted from mjy / sr to @xmath1jy and aperture - corrected to the calibration aperture sizes using the standard aperture corrections provided by the ssc .",
    "the irac channel 1 photometry was further corrected for pixel - phase dependence in accordance with ssc recommendations .",
    "no color correction was applied since we quote the isophotal effective wavelengths , thus eliminating most of the color - dependency of the flux calibration and rendering the magnitude of the correction negligible compared to our uncertainties .",
    "we derived our uncertainty estimates for the irac and irs data using the standard deviation of the scatter in the sub - set mosaics at each wavelength .",
    "these were then added in quadrature to the absolute calibration estimates of the irac and irs instruments ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ssc website ) .    looking at the mips mosaics , we found that the target is very faint , and there is bright source within @xmath7 pixels . while it is tempting to suspect that the bright source may , in fact , be the target , the pointing of _ spitzer _ is good to within 0.5 , while the pixel scale of the mosaic is 2.45/pix , and so there is no doubt that the fainter of the two sources is sdss1228 + 1040 .",
    "this is corroborated by matching the positions with respect to the surrounding stars .",
    "we used mopex to carry out a source extraction and subtraction on each mosaic , removing all of the high snr sources from the field ( including the close , bright neighbour ) , before carrying out iraf aperture photometry on our lower snr , unsubtracted target .",
    "we used an aperture of 3(1.224 pixels ) to extract the photometry , with a background annulus of 2032 , and applied the standard aperture corrections as given in the mips data handbook .",
    "we double - checked the flux density we obtained by performing mopex prf - fitting on our target in the original mosaics .",
    "the two methods agreed to within 10% , while the standard deviation in the spread in flux densities from the 21 mosaics gave us uncertainties of @xmath050% .",
    "the final flux density was taken as the unweighted median in the 21 measurements from the aperture photometry .",
    "the infrared spectroscopic data were taken with the infrared spectrometer and array camera ( isaac ) mounted at antu ( ut1 ) , vlt , paranal , chile .",
    "the short - wavelength grism was used in its low - resolution mode at central wavelengths 1.06@xmath1 m ( @xmath8 ) , 1.25@xmath1 m ( @xmath9 ) , 1.65@xmath1 m ( @xmath10 ) , and 2.20@xmath1 m ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "an @xmath12 slit width resulted in resolving powers in the range 650750 .",
    "the observations were conducted in service mode on two nights , 2007 april 03 ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) and 2007 april 07 ( @xmath8 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "flat fields and wavelength calibration with a xe - ar lamp ( ar only for the @xmath8 spectra ) were taken at the start of the night , and telluric standards were observed within 1 h and an airmass difference @xmath13 of the target spectra .",
    "the data were obtained as sets of 22 spectra per central wavelength with individual exposure times of 100 s. the individual spectra were taken at different positions on the detector ( ab cycles plus jittering ) to minimize the effect of bad pixels and cosmic rays .    for the reduction ,",
    "iraf packages were applied . as first steps",
    ", the data were flatfielded and `` straightened '' via a two - dimensional wavelength calibration , thus correcting for the positional dependence of the dispersion .",
    "corresponding ab pairs were subtracted from each other , and the resulting data then were combined to a single image .",
    "subsequently , the target and standard spectra were extracted . in the case of the @xmath8 spectrum it proved necessary to adjust the wavelength calibration using the night sky lines @xcite .",
    "the following stars were used as telluric standards : hd  106807 ( a1v , @xmath14k ) for the @xmath8 data , hip  43699 ( b4v , 17000k ) for @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and hip  88857 ( b3v , 19000k ) for @xmath11 .",
    "the intrinsic lines of the standards were fitted with a voigt profile and subtracted from the infrared spectrum , to yield a pure atmospheric absorption spectrum . for the @xmath8 data ,",
    "the intrinsic lines were submerged in atmospheric absorption bands and could not be corrected for . the target spectra",
    "were then divided by their corresponding telluric spectra , after the latter had been shifted and scaled to match the position and depths of the atmospheric features in the target data .",
    "finally , the spectra were multiplied with a blackbody corresponding to the effective temperature of the telluric standard , thus recovering the intrinsic sed .",
    "we used the isaac @xmath15 acquisition images to perform differential photometry against nearby bright stars that have reliable magnitudes in 2mass , where we assumed a conservative 10% error for the ir fluxes derived from these measurements .",
    "the @xmath15 magnitudes of sdss1228 + 1040 obtained in this way were then used to correct the flux level of the isaac spectra for slit losses .",
    "sdss1228 + 1040 is within the footprint of the large area survey within the third data release ( dr3 ) of the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ukidss ) .",
    "we obtained @xmath16 aperture magnitudes from the wfcam archive @xcite , and converted them to fluxes at the effective wavelengths using the zero - point definitions in @xcite .",
    "the agreement between the ukidss and isaac @xmath15 fluxes is very good .",
    "the results of the _ spitzer _ , ukidss and isaac photometry are given in table[table : photometry ] , along with their uncertainties .",
    "figure[fig : sdss1228_sed ] shows the _ spitzer _ and isaac photometry , and the isaac spectroscopy plotted on the same axes as the uv and optical data from @xcite .",
    "the model of the expected flux from the white dwarf ( taken from the same paper ) is also shown .",
    "there is an substantial flux excess over the expected emission from the white dwarf , starting in the @xmath11 band and increasing out to 16@xmath1 m , before dropping at 24@xmath1 m .",
    "we attempted to model this excess with a simple optically thick , geometrically thin dust disk model with a temperature profile @xmath17 , with @xmath18 , as previously used e.g. by @xcite and @xcite . in principle",
    ", @xmath19 can take values different from 3/4 depending on the size of the dust grains , as the grains will cool inefficently once that the grain size is comparable or smaller than the peak wavelength of the planck function at the grain temperature , @xmath20 ( with @xmath21 the wien constant , for details , see @xcite ) . in practice",
    ", however , we found that values significantly different from 3/4 do not produce viable results .",
    "as in @xcite , we therefore adopt this value for our modelling .",
    "the input parameters are given in table[table : modelparams ] .",
    "the model is shown in figure[fig : optthick ] .",
    "while it fits the near - ir , irac and mips points well , the 16 micron flux density is 2.0 sigma greater than predicted .",
    "this 16 @xmath1 m excess may be explained by the presence of a significant silicate emision feature at 10@xmath1 m , as seen in the similar dusty white dwarf gd362 .",
    "@xcite found that this emission feature has a strong red wing that , if present in sdss1228 + 1040 , would contribute significantly to the irs peak - up band ( which has a passband from 13  18.5 @xmath1 m ) .",
    "it is possible that such a feature would also affect the 8 @xmath1 m flux density , but the blue wing of the silicate feature in gd362 was less pronounced than the red wing , so the effect is expected to be minor ( of order a few % ) .",
    "this is not currently accounted for in the model , but could explain the slight rise seen at 8 @xmath1 m from the rest of the irac bands .",
    "the isaac , ukidss and _ spitzer space telescope _ data show a noticeable infrared excess in sdss1228 + 1040 , in excess of the flux density expected from the white dwarf alone .",
    "the observed spectral energy distribution provides clear and compelling evidence for the presence of a substantial dusty component to the debris disk , in addition to the gaseous component discovered by @xcite , indicating that both gaseous and dusty debris material can coexist around a white dwarf .",
    "the presence of dust around sdss1228 + 1040 implies that debris disks can survive around relatively hot parent white dwarfs , contrary to the earlier suggestion by @xcite , based on a smaller sample of white dwarfs with debris disks , that white dwarfs hotter than around 15,000k should sublimate any orbiting dust disk .",
    "our model shows that an optically thick dust disk model can reproduce the sed seen in sdss1228 + 1040 , except for the 16 @xmath1 m point , which we currently attribute to the red wing of a strong silicate feature at 10@xmath1 m , as seen in similar systems ( e.g. gd 362 ) .",
    "we calculated a lower - limit estimate of the mass of dust in the optically thick disk using the generic mass absorption coefficient used by @xcite of :      where we follow their example and adopt @xmath23 ( see * ? ? ? * for a more in - depth discussion ) .",
    "this leads to a disk mass of at least 1 @xmath24 g , equivalent to @xmath01.3 @xmath25 or @xmath00.01 times the mass of ceres .",
    "there are , however , two main issues with our disk model .",
    "firstly , in order to match the rise from the @xmath11 band to the irac channel 1 point at 3.6@xmath1 m , we find that the inner temperature of the dust disk has to be around 1670k , which is hotter than the expected sublimation temperature of the dust grains ( around 12001400k ) .",
    "moreover , if we estimate the inner radius of the gaseous disk from @xcite using @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the velocity of the line peaks and @xmath28 is the maximum velocity at which emission is seen , then we find that the inner radius of the dusty disk at this temperature is smaller ( 18r@xmath29 ) than the inner radius of the gaseous disk ( @xmath027r@xmath29 ) .",
    "it is possible that the inclusion of a 2- or 3-zone , or warped disk model would allow us to fit the data using a cooler inner disk temperature ( and therefore larger inner dust disk radius ) but the lack of data points in the mid - ir would make it impossible to usefully constrain such a model , and so we do not pursue it further .    secondly , we find that the implied outer radius of the dusty disk ( @xmath30 ) coincides almost perfectly with the outer radius of the optically thin gaseous disk ( @xmath31@xmath32 ) , as derived by @xcite , so the gaseous dust disk permeates throughout the dusty component .",
    "this is not unexpected in itself , as the sublimating dust will likely replenish the gas disk .",
    "it is possible , however , that the lifetime of the dust grains will be relatively short due to the increased viscosity .",
    "@xcite determined the photospheric abundance of mg in sdss1228 + 1040 to be @xmath33 .",
    "using the prescription of @xcite , and assuming that hydrogen fraction in the circumstellar material is depleted by a factor one hundred with respect to its solar value , we estimate an accretion rate of @xmath34 .",
    "this is within the range of accretion rates obtained by @xcite following a similar approach for the currently known sample of metal - polluted white dwarfs with dusty debris disks .",
    "we stress , however , that this estimate of the accretion rate should is likely to be a strict upper limit , as @xmath35 is inverse proportional to the hydrogen depletion in the circumstellar material , and the factor 100 assumed above is probably underestimated @xcite .",
    "combining the accretion rate with the estimate of the disk mass from above , we estimate a lower limit on the life time of the disk of @xmath36yr .",
    "we thank the participants of the winter aas 2008 white dwarf splinter session for their extremely helpful discussions and suggestions .",
