    "the korteveg  de vries equation appears as a model for the propagation of weakly nonlinear dispersive waves in several fields . among them",
    "there are gravity driven waves on a surface of an incompressible irrotational inviscid fluid @xcite , ion acoustic waves in plasma @xcite , impulse propagation in electric circuits @xcite and so on . in the shallow water wave problem",
    "the kdv equation corresponds to the case when the bottom is even .",
    "there have been many attempts to study nonlinear waves in the case of an uneven bottom because of its significance , for instance in such phenomena as tsunamis . among the first papers dealing with a slowly varying bottom",
    "are papers of mei and le mhaut @xcite and grimshaw @xcite . when taking an appropriate average of vertical variables one arrives at green - nagdi type equations @xcite .",
    "van groesen and pudyaprasetya studied uni - directional waves over a slowly varying bottom within the hamilton approach , obtaining a forced kdv - type equation .",
    "an extensive study of wave propagation over an uneven bottom conducted before 2000 is summarized in dingemans s monograph @xcite .",
    "the papers @xcite are examples of approaches that combine linear and nonlinear theories .",
    "the gardner equation and the forced kdv equation , were also extensively investigated in this context , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .    in previous papers ,",
    "@xcite we derived a new kdv - type equation containing terms which come directly from an uneven bottom .",
    "these terms , however , appear naturally only if euler equations for the fluid motion are considered up to second order in small parameters , whereas the kdv equation is obtained in first order approximation .",
    "there are no analytic solutions for the above equation . in @xcite",
    "we presented several cases of numerical simulations for that equation obtained using the finite difference method ( fdm ) with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite that finite element method ( fem ) describes properly the dynamics of the kdv equation ( [ kdvm ] ) , which is the equation in a moving frame of reference .",
    "the first aim of this paper is to construct an effective fem method for solving higher order kdv equations , both with even bottom and uneven bottom .",
    "the second goal is to compare the results obtained in this numerical scheme with some of the results obtained earlier using the finite difference method in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ prel ] we review the kdv equation ( [ kdv1 ] ) , the extended kdv equation ( [ etaab ] ) and kdv - type equation containing direct terms from bottom variation ( [ etaabd ] ) , all expressed in scaled dimensionless variables . in section [ numm ] the construction of the numerical method for solving these equations within the fem is described .",
    "coupled sets of nonlinear equations for coefficients of expansion of solutions to these equations in a basis of piecewise linear functions are obtained . in section [ nsym ] several examples of numerical simulations are presented .",
    "extended kdv type equations , derived by some of the authors in @xcite , second order in small parameters , have the following form ( written in scaled dimensionless coordinates , in a fixed coordinate system ) . for the case with an uneven bottom @xmath0 details of the derivation of the second order equation ( [ etaabd ] ) from the set of euler equations with appropriate boundary conditions can be found in @xcite . in ( [ etaabd ] ) ,",
    "@xmath1 stands for a wave profile and @xmath2 denotes a bottom profile .",
    "subscripts are used for notation of partial derivatives , that is , for instance @xmath3 , and so on .",
    "small parameters  @xmath4 are defined by ratios of the amplitude of the wave profile  @xmath5 , the depth of undisturbed water  @xmath6 , average wavelength  @xmath7 and the amplitude of the bottom changes  @xmath8 @xmath9 for details of the transformation of the original dimensional variables to the nondimensional , scaled ones used here , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that in equation ( [ etaabd ] ) all three terms originating from an uneven bottom are second order in small parameters .",
    "these terms appear from the boundary condition at the bottom which is already in second order with coefficient @xmath10 , see equation ( 5 ) in @xcite or equation ( 10 ) in @xcite .",
    "then in the final second order equation ( [ etaabd ] ) we write them in the form @xmath11 in order to epmhasize that they all come from the second order perturbation approach . for details",
    "we refer to the mentioned papers .",
    "in the case of an even bottom ( @xmath12 ) equation ( [ etaabd ] ) is reduced to the second order kdv type equation @xmath13 and when @xmath14 it becomes identical to eq .",
    "( 21 ) in @xcite",
    ". equation ( [ etaab ] ) was obtained earlier by marchant and smyth @xcite and called the _ extended kdv _ equation .",
    "limitation to first order approximation in small parameters gives the kdv in a fixed system of coordinates @xmath15    the standard , mathematical form of the kdv equation is obtained from ( [ kdv1 ] ) by transformation to a moving reference frame . substituting @xmath16",
    "one obtains from ( [ etaab ] ) the equation @xmath17 or finally , when  @xmath14 , @xmath18 in this paper we attempt to solve numerically the equation ( [ etaabd ] ) for several cases of bottom topography and different initial conditions . in several points",
    "we follow the method applied by debussche and printems  @xcite .",
    "however , the method is extended to higher order kdv type equations with plain bottom ( [ etaab ] ) and with bottom fluctuations ( [ etaabd ] ) . for both cases we work in a fixed reference system , necessary for a bottom profile depending on the position .",
    "the emergence of soliton solutions to the kdv equation was observed in numerics fifty years ago by @xcite .",
    "several numerical methods used for solving the kdv equation are discussed in @xcite . among them",
    "are the finite difference explicit method @xcite , the finite difference implicit method @xcite and several versions of the pseudospectral method , as in @xcite .",
    "it is also worth mentioning papers using the fem and galerkin methods @xcite .",
    "most numerical applications use periodic boundary conditions , but there exist also works that apply dirichlet boundary conditions on a finite interval @xcite .",
    "the authors are trying to construct a method which will be applicable not only for the numerical simulation of an evolution of nonlinear waves governed by equations ( [ etaabd ] ) or ( [ etaab ] ) but also for their stochastic versions .",
    "such stochastic equations will be studied in the next paper .",
    "since stochastic noise is irregular , solutions are not necessarily smooth , neither in time nor space . a finite element method ( fem )",
    "seems to be suitable for such a case .",
    "we have adapted the crank  nicholson scheme for time evolution , beginning with the kdv equation ( [ kdv1 ] ) in a fixed coordinate system .",

    "the lowest invariant , @xmath180 , represents the conservation law for the mass ( volume ) of the liquid .",
    "the second , @xmath181 , is related to momentum conservation , and the third , @xmath182 , is related to energy conservation . however , as pointed by @xcite , the relations between @xmath183 and momentum and @xmath184 and energy are more complex .",
    "approximate conservation of these invariants serves often as a test of the precision of numerical simulations .",
    "however , this is not the case for the second order kdv type equations ( [ etaabd ] ) and ( [ etaab ] ) .",
    "it was noted in @xcite that @xmath185 is an invariant of equations ( [ etaabd ] ) and ( [ etaab ] ) but @xmath183 and @xmath184 are not invariants .",
    "therefore , only @xmath185 can be used as a test for the precision of numerical calculations of waves moving according to the second order extended kdv equations . in all the presented calculations the precision of the numerical values of @xmath185 was consistently high ( the values @xmath186 ) .",
    "wave motion according to kdv and extended ( second order ) kdv equations is usually calculated in the reference frame moving with the natural velocity @xmath187 in scaled dimensionless variables ( in original variables @xmath188 ) .",
    "the kdv and extended kdv equations for a moving reference frame are obtained by the transformation @xmath189 which removes the term @xmath190 from the equation ( [ etaab ] ) .",
    "then the soliton velocity in the fixed frame is proportional to @xmath191 whereas in the moving frame it is proportional to @xmath192 .",
    "therefore , for value of @xmath193 the distance covered by a soliton in the moving frame is @xmath194 times shorter than the distance covered in the fixed frame for the same duration . then , with the same number of the mesh points @xmath71 the mesh size @xmath195 can be more than 20 times smaller assuring a much higher precision of calculation in the moving frame at the same operational cost .",
    "for instance @xcite obtained a good precision for motion of kdv soliton with the fem method using @xmath196 , @xmath197 and time step @xmath198 on the interval @xmath199 $ ] .",
    "precision of fem method in the fixed frame can be tested by calculation of a root mean square ( rms ) of deviations of wave profile obtained numerically from those obtained from the analytic solution .",
    "denote by @xmath200 and @xmath201 the values of the solutions at given mesh point @xmath202 an time instant @xmath203 , analytic and numerical , respectively .",
    "then the rms is expressed as @xmath204    we checked our implementation of the fem on the interval @xmath205 $ ] using several different sizes @xmath195 of the mesh and several time values .",
    "[ ff8 ] displays the rms ( [ var ] ) values for @xmath206 .",
    "it shows that deviations from analytic solution decrease substantialy with decreasing  @xmath195 .",
    "small @xmath195 assures a very high precision in numerical simulations , however , at the expense of large computation time .",
    "another tests ( not shown here ) in which @xmath195 was fixed and rms was calculated as a function of time showed that for @xmath135 rms increases with time linerly and very slowly .    when the bottom is not flat simulations _ have to be done in the fixed reference frame_. for our purposes we needed to choose the @xmath147 intervals of the order of 70 or 80 .",
    "even for @xmath207 the size of jacobian matrices ( [ j2 ] ) reaches ( 4000@xmath2084000 ) and its inversion is time consuming . in a compromise between numerical precision and reasonable computing times we made our simulations with @xmath207 .",
    "this choice resulted in about one week of computing time for a single run on the cluster . in spite of the insufficient precision the results presented in figs . 1 - 7 reproduce details of evolution known from our previous studies , obtained with the finite difference method .",
    "these details , resulting from second order terms in extended kdv ( [ etaab ] ) , are seen in fig .",
    "[ plaskie ] as a wavetrain of small amplitude created behind the main one ( compare with fig .  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "a similar wavetrain behind the main one was observed in numerical simulations by @xcite , see e.g.  fig .  2 therein .",
    "for waves moving with presence of bottom obstacle these secondary waves behind the main one are amplified by interaction with the bottom and new faster secondary waves appear ( see , e.g. , figs .  2 - 4 ) .",
    "these effects were already observed by us , see figs .  6 and 7 in @xcite .",
    "* a weak formulation of the finite element method ( fem ) for extended kdv equation ( [ etaab ] ) can be effectively used for numerical calculations of the time evolution of both soliton and cnoidal waves when calculations are done in a moving frame . * since numerical calculations for equation ( [ etaabd ] ) have to be performed in a fixed frame , the presented fem method is not as effective as the fdm method used by us in previous papers because the computer time necessary for obtaining sufficiently high precision becomes impractical . on the other hand , the presented results ( though not as precise as fdm ones ) exhibit all secondary structures generated by higher order terms of the equations .",
    "* first tests of numerical solutions to second order kdv type equations with a stochastic term seem to be very promising @xcite .",
