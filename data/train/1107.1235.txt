    "of the 550 planets known to orbit stars other than our sun , the transiting systems are the most interesting ones . transiting extrasolar planets ( teps ) are the only planets outside our solar system whose masses and radii , and thus surface gravities and mean densities , can be measured to reasonable precision .",
    "observational selection effects mean that most known teps orbit very close to their parent star and thus have highly irradiated atmospheres whose physical properties can be scrutinised using high - quality astronomical observations .",
    "one hindrance to the study of teps is that measurement of their physical properties requires not only transit light curves and radial velocity measurements of the parent stars , but also some sort of additional constraint .",
    "this is ordinarily obtained by forcing the properties of the star to match predictions from theoretical stellar models , guided by an effective temperature ( @xmath1 ) and metal abundance ( @xmath2 $ ] ) obtained from spectral analysis .",
    "the dependence on stellar theory leads to systematic errors which can be sizeable for some of the measured quantities , and also allows inhomogeneities to occur between studies which use different theoretical predictions or apply the constraint in a different way .",
    "this in turn compromises statistical studies of transiting planets .    for these reasons",
    "i am measuring the properties of the known teps using strictly homogeneous methods .",
    "paperi @xcite discussed the methodology used to model the transit light curves , paying particular attention to error analysis and the treatment of limb darkening , and applied them to the 14 systems with good observational data at the time .",
    "paperii @xcite explored the application of constraints from seven different sets of theoretical model predictions and alternatively an empirical mass  radius relation obtained from eclipsing binaries .",
    "three of the sets of theoretical predictions were selected to aid in the determination of the physical properties of the same 14 systems , with detailed error budgets including random and systematic contributions . in paperiii",
    "@xcite i extended the number of systems to 30 and the number of theoretical predictions used to five sets , improving both the statistical weight of the ensemble and the precision of the systematic errorbars .    in the current work",
    "i enlarge the number of teps with homogeneous properties to 58 , concentrating on those which have been observed by the space missions _ kepler _",
    "@xcite , corot  @xcite and epoch @xcite . in paperii",
    "i outlined the concept of applying an observational mass  radius relation instead of using constraints from stellar theory , resulting in totally empirical measurements of the properties of tep systems .",
    "this approach was not very successful ( see paperiii ) because the mass - radius relation did not allow for stellar evolution and had to be calibrated on low - mass eclipsing binary systems whose properties ( primarily radius ) are affected by magnetic activity arising from comparatively fast rotation . in the current work",
    "i follow the alternative approach of @xcite which relates the radius of the star to its density , @xmath1  and @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "this technique is not purely empirical , as it incorporates parameters derived using spectral synthesis techniques for both the tep hosts and the calibrating sample , but returns results in much better agreement with the default method using theoretical predictions .",
    "finally , i explore the opportunities for further study of the systems studied in this work .    for a small number of teps it is possible to either partially or totally avoid systematic errors :",
    "the study of transit timing variations ( ttvs ) allow the masses of some teps to be constrained directly @xcite ; and radial velocities of the _ planet _ hd209458b have been measured by @xcite from infrared absorption lines , allowing the system properties to be calculated in an identical way to double - lined eclipsing binary star systems .",
    "these methods are , however , not applicable to the predominant population of teps which show no detectable ttvs and are not amenable to direct velocity measurements .",
    "i have modelled the light curves of each tep using the methods espoused in paperi . in short ,",
    "the jktebopjkt / codes / jktebop.html ] code @xcite is used to model the available transit light curves .",
    "the components are approximated as biaxial spheroids whose shapes are governed by the mass ratio , @xmath3 .",
    "the results in this work are all extremely insensitive to the values adopted for @xmath3 .",
    "the main parameters of a jktebop fit are the orbital inclination , @xmath4 , and the fractional radii of the star and planet , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "these are defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the volume - equivalent stellar and planetary radii and @xmath10 is the orbital semimajor axis . in jktebop the fractional radii",
    "are re - parameterised as their sum and ratio : @xmath11 as these are less strongly correlated . in general the orbital period , @xmath12 ,",
    "is taken from the literature and the time of transit midpoint , @xmath13 , is included as a fitted parameter .",
    "each light curve is fitted with a number of different approaches to limb darkening ( ld ) .",
    "1@xmath14 errorbars are obtained using 1000 monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "errorbars are also calculated using a residual permutation ( or `` prayer bead '' ) algorithm @xcite which accounts for correlated observational noise , and the largest of the two alternatives is adopted for each parameter .",
    "the ld of the star has an important influence on transit light curves . for each light curve",
    ", solutions are obtained using five different ld laws , each with three different approaches to the limb darkening coefficients ( ldcs ) : ( 1 ) both fixed ( hereafter ` ld - fixed ' ) ; ( 2 ) the linear one ( @xmath15 ) fitted and the nonlinear one ( @xmath16 ) fixed but perturbed by @xmath170.05 in the error analysis simulations ( ` ld - fit / fix ' ) ; and ( 3 ) both coefficients fitted ( ` ld - fitted ' ) .",
    "initial or fixed values for the ldcs are bilinearly interpolated in @xmath1  and @xmath18  within the tabulated theoretical predictions included in the jktldjkt / codes / jktld.html ] code .",
    "once the best of the three alternatives ( ld - fixed , ld - fit / fix , ld - fitted ) is identified , the combined solution for that option is calculated by taking the mean of the solutions for the four two - coefficient ld laws and by taking the largest errorbar from these solutions plus a contribution to account for the scatter in the parameter values . in most cases",
    "the ld - fit / fix solutions turn out to be the best compromise between severing the dependence on theoretical calculations and trying to fit too many parameters to the data .",
    "some teps have a non - circular orbit which changes the duration of the transit but has a negligible effect on the light curve shape @xcite .",
    "i account for this by adding published constraints on orbital eccentricity ( @xmath19 ) and periastron longitude ( @xmath20 ) , with the parameter combinations @xmath21 and @xmath22 when possible , using the approach outlined in paperiii and @xcite .",
    "an additional annoyance for some systems is light from a nearby star contaminating the photometry ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this ` third light ' makes the transit shallower but can not be fitted for in the light curve due to strong degeneracy with @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath4 ( see paperiii ) .",
    "when third light is known to exist it is accounted for using the method put forward by @xcite .",
    "parameters of light curve solutions of an undersampled light curve , closely resembling that of kepler-6 , with different numbers of numerical integration points used in the solution .",
    "unbroken lines show the correct parameter values and dotted lines show the @xmath171% intervals for these parameters . ]",
    "plot of a model light curve closely resembling that of kepler-6 , but covering 32 instead of 12 orbital periods ( blue points ) .",
    "this is compared to the best fit obtained without using numerical integration ( red line ) .",
    "the residuals of the fit are plotted at the base of the figure offset from zero . ]    in some light curves the sampling rate is a significant fraction of the transit duration , leading to a smearing of the transit shape . if left uncorrected this could cause errors of up to 30% ( worst - case scenario ) in the physical properties of teps .",
    "the prime candidates for this problem are the _ kepler _  planets , whose long - cadence photometric points consist of summations of 270 consecutive datapoints leading to an overall sampling rate of one datum every 29.4244min @xcite .",
    "some of the corot  satellite data are also affected , as the standard cadence for this instrument is 512s .",
    "most corot  teps also have short - cadence sampling with a rate of 32s ; these data do not suffer from temporal undersampling .",
    "for the current work i have modified jktebop to optionally perform numerical integration to cope with the _ kepler _  and corot  data .",
    "the approach is to calculate a given number of model datapoints ( @xmath23 ) evenly spread over a given time interval , and sum them to create an integrated datapoint which can be directly compared with observations .",
    "the next question is : how fine a time sampling is necessary ?",
    "i created a dataset very similar to that of the tep kepler-6 by generating a model light curve ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , quadratic ld ) , extending it over 12 orbital cycles , and summing it into 29.4min bins .",
    "this was then fitted with @xmath23 varied from 1 ( i.e.  no numerical integration ) to 15 ( equivalent to a 1.96min sampling rate ) .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath4 are plotted in fig.[fig : lc : numint : diff1 ] and show that @xmath27 is more affected than @xmath28 and @xmath4 .",
    "using @xmath29 means we incur an error of only 0.1% in @xmath27 ; using @xmath30 would engender a 1% error .",
    "teps with shorter orbital periods ( i.e.  quicker transits ) or higher @xmath4 ( sharper partial phases ) will be more strongly affected .",
    "fig.[fig : lc : numint : diff2 ] shows the kepler-6-like model light curve extended to cover 32 orbital cycles and summed into 29.4min bins .",
    "this has been fitted by jktebop but without performing numerical integration , in order to demonstrate the effect of neglecting the undersampling .",
    "the fitted model is unable to correctly reproduce the synthetic data during the partial phases of the transit , the discrepancy being worst at the first and last contact points where the light curve derivative is of greatest magnitude .",
    "this suggests that it would be possible to _ fit _ for the amount of numerical integration needed for a high - quality dataset , although it is very unlikely that such an option will ever be useful .",
    "the amount of numerical integration needed will also be quite sensitive to ld , particularly around the limb of the star .",
    "analysis of a transit light curve gives the quantities @xmath31 , @xmath13 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath4 .",
    "radial velocity ( rv ) measurements of the parent star yield its orbital velocity amplitude , @xmath32 . measuring the physical properties of the system",
    "requires an additional constraint , which is normally taken from theoretical stellar evolutionary models .",
    "the observed stellar effective temperature , @xmath1  and metal abundance , @xmath2 $ ] , are useful to guide this process , which is discussed in detail in paperii and paperiii .",
    "i use the velocity amplitude of the _ planet _ ( @xmath33 ) to control the solution process",
    ". a starting value is guessed , and is combined with the measured @xmath31 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath4 and @xmath32 to obtain the physical properties of the system using standard formulae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting calculated stellar mass ( @xmath34 ) and measured @xmath2 $ ]  are used to obtain the expected stellar radius ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath1  by interpolation in a set of tabulated theoretical predictions .",
    "@xmath33 is then iteratively refined to obtain the best agreement with the calculated @xmath8 and observed @xmath1  by minimising the figure of merit : @xmath35 ^ 2 +              \\left[\\frac{{\\ensuremath{t_{\\rm eff}}}^{\\rm ( obs)}-{\\ensuremath{t_{\\rm eff}}}^{\\rm ( pred)}}{\\sigma({\\ensuremath{t_{\\rm eff}}}^{\\rm ( obs)})}\\right]^2\\ ] ] this process is performed for a range of ages from the zero - age to the terminal - age main sequence ( curtailed at a maximum of 20gyr ) to find the overall best fit .",
    "the code which performs this step ( jktabsdim ) has been profiled in order to improve its speed , which has allowed the step size in age to be decreased from 0.1gyr to 0.01gyr for the current work .",
    "the uncertainties on the input parameters to jktabsdim are propagated using a perturbation analysis @xcite , resulting in a complete error budget for every output parameter .",
    "this allows identification of which type of observations would be best to improve our understanding of each tep ( see sect.[sec : followup ] ) .",
    "apart from the random errors , which are calculated using the propagation analysis , systematic errors arise from the use of theoretical stellar models . these can be estimated by running solutions with a range of different model predictions . as in paperiii",
    "i use five sets of model predictions : _ claret _",
    "@xcite , _ teramo _",
    "@xcite , _ vrss _ @xcite and _ dsep _ @xcite .",
    "jktabsdim is run with each of these five sets , and the final results are taken to be the unweighted mean of the individual values for each output quantity .",
    "the statistical error is taken to be the largest of the individual uncertainties from the perturbation analysis , and the systematic error to be the standard deviation of the values from each of the model sets .",
    "the final results therefore rest evenly on the predictions of all five model sets .",
    "since paperiii i have obtained additional tabulations for the _ claret _ models , for fractional metal abundances of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , to allow for @xmath2 $ ]  values down to @xmath39 .",
    "i have also identified and fixed a mistake in my reformatting of the _ vrss _ models which caused the wrong @xmath34 values to be used for a small number of tabulations .",
    "the final results from five runs of jktabsdim with different theoretical model sets is the following parameters with statistical and systematic errorbars : the mass , radius , surface gravity and density of the star ( @xmath34 , @xmath8 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) and of the planet ( @xmath42 , @xmath9 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) . in additional to this",
    "i calculate a surrogate for the equilibrium temperature for the planet : @xmath45 and also its @xcite number : @xmath46 three quantities are independent of stellar theory : @xmath43 @xcite , @xmath41 @xcite and @xmath47  ( paperiii ) .      [ cols= \" < , > , < , > , < , > , < , > , < \" , ]",
    "the physical properties of 32 transiting extrasolar planetary systems have been derived from public light curves and published spectroscopic parameters of the host stars . these include 15 systems observed by the corot  satellite , ten by _ kepler _ , and five by the epoch project on the _ deep impact _ spacecraft .",
    "combined with the 30 objects examined in paperiii , a sample of 58 teps with homogeneously measured properties is obtained .",
    "all available transit light curves of each tep were obtained and modelled using the jktebop code , with careful attention paid to the treatment of limb darkening , contaminating light , orbital eccentricity , poisson and correlated noise , and long effective exposure times .",
    "the results for each light curve were then amalgamated to yield combined photometric parameters for the system , which were compared with literature results .",
    "the physical properties of the teps were calculated from measured quantities by applying constraints from theoretical models , guided by the atmospheric parameters of the host stars .",
    "five different sets of theoretical model tabulations were used , and the final results for each tep are the unweighted mean of the individual results for each output parameter .",
    "systematic errors were estimated by the interagreement between the individual model results , and statistical errors were propagated using a perturbation analysis .",
    "the constants and units needed in this process were tabulated for reference , and an error in the unit used for planetary density was fixed .",
    "i also calculated the physical properties of each tep system using a constraint obtained from eclipsing binary star systems ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the constraint was applied in the form of @xmath48}})$ ] , where the precise equation and calibration coefficients were determined using the the measured properties of 90 well - studied detached eclipsing binaries .",
    "this gives results in generally good agreement with those from using theoretical stellar models as a constraint , although a trend towards poorer agreement is seen at higher metallicities .",
    "it is not obvious whether this trend arises from an imperfection in the calibration equation or source data , or from the physical effects included in the theoretical models .",
    "the resulting physical properties of the 32 tep systems are typically in good agreement with published results , but exceptions exist .",
    "my results for corot-5 disagree with those of the discovery paper , and this may be related to the treatment of orbital eccentricity .",
    "the public light curve of corot-8 does not match the published orbital ephemeris : i measure a revised ephemeris and somewhat different properties compared to the discovery paper .",
    "the two corot  light curves ( short and long cadence ) of corot-13 are discrepant .",
    "after rejection of the much less reliable 512s cadence data i find physical properties of the system which are very different to previously thought .",
    "the resulting density of the planet is almost a factor of three smaller , moving it from outlier status to more representative of the general population of transiting hot jupiters .",
    "many of the error estimates in the literature are far smaller than i find , and are not supported by the intrinsic quality of the data .",
    "my analysis of the teps observed by _ kepler _  uses data from quarters 0 , 1 and 2 for most of the objects .",
    "it is therefore the first analysis of most of the teps to include short - cadence data .",
    "this allows me to provide updated ephemerides and more reliable physical properties .",
    "my results for kepler-5 are somewhat different to those previously published , due primarily to the inclusion of the quarter 2 short - cadence data .",
    "asteroseismic studies are available for the three previously - known teps in the _ kepler _  field , based on the _ kepler _  short - cadence data , and for hd17156 based on hst data .",
    "these studies use theoretical stellar models to interpret the oscillation spectrum of the star , and measure the stellar density to very high precision .",
    "the corresponding values i find from the light curve analysis are in good agreement for hd17156 ( 0.8@xmath14 ) and tres-2 ( 1.1@xmath14 ) but not for hat - p-7 ( 2.9@xmath14 ) or hat - p-11 ( 6.5@xmath14 ) .",
    "this indicates a problem with at least one of the approaches , which might be related to underestimation of the true uncertainties , starspot activity or the measured orbital eccentricity of the hat - p-11 system .    finally , the complete error budgets generated for each tep system allow identification of the observations which would lead to the greatest improvement in our measurement of their physical properties .",
    "many objects would benefit from further photometric observations  which continue to be obtained for the the teps in the _ kepler _  field of view  as well as from spectroscopic radial velocity measurements and spectral synthesis analyses .",
    "a list of nine tep systems is given whose orbital ephemerides will become uncertain by more than one hour within this decade ; the transits of corot-4 and corot-14 are already not predictable to within one hour .",
    "the homogeneous physical properties obtained in this work will be useful for detailed statistical studies of the extrasolar planet population as well as for planning many types of follow - up observations of these objects .",
    "the primary results from the current work and from previous papers in the series , along with a range of other useful information , have been concatenated and placed in an online catalogue .",
    "tepcat is available at http://www.astro.keele.ac.uk/@xmath0jkt/tepcat/ in a range of convenient formats for readers to download for reference and further study .",
    "i am grateful to antonio claret for calculating new theoretical models for me , to barry smalley and pierre maxted for extensive discussions about transiting planetary systems , and to the anonymous referee for a helpful report .",
