    "based on the symmetries of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in the low energy region ( @xmath1 1 gev ) , chiral effective field theory ( @xmath2eft ) enables calculations of strong interaction in the non - perturbative region .",
    "however , unlike the pion - pion and pion - nulceon section , where the power counting  the key ingredient which guarantees the intrinsic consistency of an eft is given clearly from the vertices generated by the chiral lagrangian , the power counting in nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) case is hindered by the infrared enhancement and can not be obtained straightforwardly .",
    "the first step out of the nn problem , as suggested by weinberg@xcite , is to apply the power counting to the nn potential level first , and then sum the amplitude by iterating the potential in schrodinger or lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation with an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath3 .",
    "currently , this prescription ( the so - call weinberg power counting ( wpc ) ) has been carried out to next - to - next - to - next - to leading order ( n@xmath4lo ) , and has became the standard of many conventional calculations@xcite .",
    "however , since weinberg prescription only applies power counting to the potential level , the systematic control of the theory could be lost in the final amplitude .",
    "one way to check whether a proposed scheme is under control is to perform the rg - analysis .",
    "rg - analysis carried out at leading order ( lo ) , up to next - to - next - to leading order ( nnlo ) and n@xmath4lo based on wpc indicate that the conventional implementation of wpc fails to fulfill the rg requirement once the ultraviolet cutoff of the iteration @xmath5 gev@xcite . since the chiral expansion is established in powers of @xmath6 , @xmath7 the nn c.m .",
    "momentum , @xmath8 the pion mass , and the breakdown scale @xmath9 is nominally @xmath10 . ]",
    ", some authors@xcite have questioned whether the theory is valid once intermediate states have @xmath11 .",
    "thus , it makes little sense to perform rg - analysis for @xmath5 gev , even the final on - shell @xmath12 .",
    "a second point of view@xcite takes the final amplitude as a partial sum of the ( infinitely many ) diagrams , then under the assumption that a reasonable separation of scales exists , in any eft one should be able to organize those diagrams in a systematic way to absorb the unimportant physics into contact term(s ) order by order after a proper renormalization .",
    "thus , as long as @xmath12 , the impact of high - energy physics ( which is well - represented by the contact term(s ) ) in the final amplitude should reduce as the increase of @xmath3 , since the contribution from physics havent been integrated out ( i.e. , from @xmath13 to @xmath14 ) becomes smaller and smaller .",
    "the answer of the above in - debating issue actually depends on how the diagrams are organized .",
    "it was shown that due to the fine - tuning of low energy constants and a wigner bond - like effect@xcite , once a cutoff @xmath15 gev is adopted the renormalization is effectively dominated by one contact term under the wpc scheme@xcite . moreover ,",
    "a full - iteration of some type of irreducible two - pion - exchange diagrams could result in a pole - like structure@xcite .",
    "therefore , if one insists to build a nn potential based on @xmath2eft and utilizes it later in a conventional way ( e.g. , inserts it as a potential in schrodinger or ls equation ) , he or she needs to stay in @xmath16 mev .",
    "the consequence is that a full rg - based analysis becomes inapplicable .    to allow a full rg - analysis",
    ", one must give up treating the whole chiral potential non - perturbatively .",
    "in other words , for the nn case there exists no ideal potential \" ( in the traditional sense ) to be extracted or derived .",
    "some parts of the diagrams have to be included perturbatively .",
    "recent works@xcite which treat the subleading chiral potentials in the framework of distorted - wave - born - approximation enable a full rg- and power counting analysis .",
    "once the @xmath17dependence is under well - control , the estimation of the theoretical error becomes much easier , i.e. , the error is given by @xmath18 ) up to order - n in the new power counting scheme .",
    "we must point out that the lacks of a rg - analysis can not rule out the possibility that wpc under the specified range of @xmath3  could generate final amplitudes which has the correct power counting , but there is no way to check this so far . on the other hand , a rg - correct scheme could converge too slowly to be useful .",
    "thus , before the full implementation to few- and many - body calculations , one can not determine the superiority of either scheme .",
    "nevertheless , it is of importance to start with a scheme which allows a full rg - analysis first , then check the power counting step by step to build the theory on a more solid ground .",
    "the new power counting developed so far @xcite can be summarized as :    \\1 .",
    "the lo potential needs to be iterated to all order partial - waves .",
    "] , and all subleading chiral potentials are included perturbatively as represented diagrammatically in fig .",
    "[ fig - z ] .",
    "the contact terms are determined by rg - analysis to guarantee the correct rg - behavior . as a general rule , for potentials which are singular and attractive at lo ( i.e. , @xmath19 with @xmath20 ) , all contact terms need to be promoted one order earlier with respect to wpc .",
    "phase shifts from the above new scheme are evaluated up to nnlo , and the agreement with the nijmegen phase - shift analysis  @xcite is comparable to those from wpc at the same order .",
    "furture tasks such as refining power counting with lepage plot@xcite or similar techniques , including delta ( 1232 ) contribution , and deciding the power counting for high partial - waves ( @xmath21 ) are under investigation .",
