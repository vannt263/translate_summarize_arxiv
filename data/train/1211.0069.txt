    "since the discovery that super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) sit at the centers of most massive galaxy in the local universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , determining their formation history remains one of big challenges in astrophysics .",
    "it has been further determined that the mass of smbhs correlates tightly with the physical properties of their host spheroids ( @xmath5 vs. @xmath6 relations ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such a correlation implies a physical connection between the growth histories of smbhs and the spheroidal components of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "bolometric luminosities of agns reflect the mass accretion rates of their smbhs , therefore the luminosity function of agns and its cosmological evolution reflects the growth history of smbhs through accretion @xcite .",

    "the number density evolution of agns in different luminosity bins shows that higher luminosity agns , i.e. qsos , have a peak at higher redshifts , the so - called `` down - sizing '' trend of cosmological evolution of agns .",
    "the total amount of accreted matter estimated by integrating the luminosity functions over luminosity and redshift roughly matches to the estimated mass density of smbhs in the local universe @xcite , thus accretion is thought to be the dominant mode of smbh growth . applying the continuity equation for the smbh population , @xcite evaluate the average growth curves of massive and less - massive smbhs as a function of redshift .",
    "these results imply that smbhs grow rapidly at redshifts between 1 and 2 , and more massive smbhs grow more than less massive smbhs in the earlier universe , as expected from the `` down - sizing '' trend of the agn luminosity function .",
    "the luminosity of an agn does not simply reflect the mass of its smbh . in the calculations of the black hole growth history , the eddington ratio ,",
    "i.e. the ratio between the observed accretion rate and the eddington - limited accretion rate ( @xmath7 ) , is assumed to be constant in agns with different luminosities and redshifts . assuming a constant eddington ratio for agns , their luminosity directly corresponds to the mass of their smbhs , and the mass - dependent growth history of smbhs can be calculated .",
    "however , recent evaluations of the eddington - ratio distribution of agns in the local universe show that agns have a wide range of eddington - ratio with no preferred value @xcite . therefore , in order to quantitatively understand the accretion growth history of smbhs , it is necessary to evaluate smbh masses in any agn sample for which the cosmological evolution of the luminosity function is evaluated",
    ".    tools are now available to measure black hole masses of broad - line agns .",
    "reverberation mapping of local broad - line agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) reveals the scaling relationship between the 5100 monochromatic luminosity ( @xmath8 ) of the broad - line agn and the size of its broad h@xmath9 emitting region @xcite . utilizing this relationship , black hole masses of a large sample of broad - line agns",
    "can be estimated from their luminosities and broad h@xmath9 line widths ( @xmath10 ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from the relationship @xmath11 under the assumption that the broad - line region is virialized @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath12 depends on the dynamical structure of the broad - line region , and it is empirically determined by assuming that the black hole mass obtained from the reverberation mapping method and the velocity dispersion of its host bulge follow the @xmath5 vs. @xmath13 relation of local non - active galaxies @xcite .",
    "this method has been extended to black hole mass estimations using other broad lines , such as @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath15 @xcite , and h@xmath1 @xcite , and using luminosities at other wavelengths such as the 3000 monochromatic luminosity @xcite , the h@xmath1 line luminosity @xcite , and the hard x - ray luminosity @xcite .",
    "these relationships are calibrated against the black hole mass estimated by the reverberation mapping or that from the single - epoch broad - line width of h@xmath9 and the monochromatic luminosity . using these extended methods , black hole masses of broad - line agns at various redshifts",
    "can be estimated from their single - epoch optical spectra .",
    "applying black hole mass estimates from single - epoch spectra to statistical samples of broad - line agns , black hole mass functions ( bhmfs ) of broad - line agns can be evaluated @xcite . in the local universe",
    ", @xcite derived the bhmf and eddington - ratio distribution function ( erdf ) of broad - line agns detected in the hamburg / eso agn survey .",
    "they corrected the effects of the flux limits of their survey in their evaluation of the broad - line agn bhmf and erdf , i.e. the fact that the low - mass end of the sample only covers high eddington ratio agns , by assuming that the erdf is constant regardless of the black hole mass and applying maximum likelihood method .",
    "hereafter we label bhmf and erdf derived by @xmath2 method with _ binned _ and those corrected for the detection limit by maximum likelihood method with _",
    "corrected_. the _ corrected _ broad - line agn bhmf covering @xmath5 values between @xmath16 and @xmath17 and @xmath7 down to @xmath18 shows rather steep decrease in number density as a function of mass with no significant break in the mass range covered .",

    "the  down - sizing \" trend expected from the agn luminosity function is confirmed by the steeper decrease of active smbhs in the higher mass range from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "however , it needs to be noted that broad - line agns in the sdss sample only cover large @xmath5 and large @xmath7 agns in the redshift range .",

    ", the discrepancy between the _ binned _ and _ estimated _ broad - line agn bhmfs is as large as two orders of magnitude in the mass range around @xmath27 at @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to examine the cosmological evolution of bhmfs and erdfs , a sample of broad - line agns with fainter detection limits is needed .    in order to reveal accretion onto smbhs in an era of violent growth",
    ", we examine the bhmf and erdf of broad - line agns at @xmath3 using a sample constructed from the x - ray survey of the subaru _ xmm - newton _ deep survey ( sxds ) field .",
    "as suggested by the smbh growth curves @xcite , a significant part of the accretion growth of smbhs is thought to be taking place in the redshift range between 1 and 2 .",
    "therefore the direct determination of the bhmf and erdf in this redshift range is of critical importance .",
    "thanks to the moderately deep detection limit and wide area of the survey , we can construct a large sample of broad - line agns which is one order of magnitude fainter than that available from sdss .",

    "the remaining discrepancy can be caused by the possible incompleteness of the broad - line agn bhmf due to the spectroscopic incompleteness and the difficulties in identifying broad - line agns with substantial host contamination .",

    "this is mostly because broad - line agns with lower eddington ratio are detected in the sxds sample than in the sdss ; the sdss sample is only 30% complete down to @xmath5 of @xmath245 and @xmath7 of @xmath246 at @xmath3 @xcite .",

    "the sxds sample shows a hint of turn - over at a mass of @xmath178 .",
    "the difference in the _ corrected _ broad - line agn bhmf may be indicative of a down - sizing trend of accretion activity among the smbh population . as mentioned in section  [ sec_correction ] , it needs to be noted that the identification of broad - line agns could be incomplete in the low - mass end .",

    "such growth implies that the multiple of the eddington ratio and duty cycle has order of 0.1 in that period for the massive smbhs , if we use the rest mass energy to radiation energy conversion efficiency of 0.1 .",
    "it needs to be noted that the high - mass end of the _ corrected _ bhmf can be affected by the flattening due to the uncertainties of the virial black hole mass estimates , therefore the effect needs to be corrected before further quantitative evaluation of the growth of smbhs between @xmath249 to @xmath248 .",
