    "from quark model we know that a @xmath8 meson with orbital angular momentum l and total spin s must have @xmath9 and @xmath10 . thus a resonance with @xmath11 must be exotic .",
    "such a state could be a gluonic excitation such as hybrids , glueballs or multiquark states .",
    "the hybrid and glueball has been a missing link in the hadron spectrum .",
    "recently there appears experimental evidence for a @xmath12 exotic @xcite .",
    "the emergence of evidence for hybrids indicates the presence of dynamical glue in qcd and will be a direct test of low energy sector of qcd .",
    "the light @xmath0 hybrid meson mass has been found to lie between @xmath13gev @xcite-@xcite with qcd sum rules @xcite . with the same method the hybrid meson containing one heavy quark and heavy hybrid quarkonium has been studied in @xcite .",
    "some decay modes of the light @xmath0 hybrid meson are discussed in @xcite .",
    "recently the masses of the hybrid quarkonium @xmath14 states are calculated in the limit of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the hybrid meson spectrum have been studied extensively with other theoretical approaches including the constituent gluon models @xcite , the flux tube models @xcite , the mit bag model @xcite , and the lattice gauge theory @xcite .",
    "their decays have been studied in the constituent gluon model via constituent gluon dissociation @xcite , in the different versions of the flux tube model with a @xmath16 pair creation mechanism @xcite .",
    "the constituent gluon model predicts a significant width for the @xmath17 channel for the light @xmath0 hybrid meson @xcite while the width of this channel is very small in other models @xcite .",
    "in contrast the flux tube model predicts very characteristic decay modes for the @xmath0 decays .",
    "the dominant modes are @xmath18 or @xmath19 . in this model",
    "the width of the @xmath20 channel is also significant .",
    "the qcd sum rule was used to calculate the @xmath21 channels of the @xmath0 hybrid mesons with the three point correlation functions at the symmetric point @xcite .",
    "the final sum rule for the decay coupling constants suffers from large continuum and excited states contamination .",
    "since most of the decay calculation has focused on the light hybrid mesons , it will prove valuable to calculate the mass and decays of the hybrid meson with a heavy quark to see whether the same characteristic decay modes exist as in the flux tube model .",
    "the combination of the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite and the light cone qcd sum rules @xcite provides a convenient framework to calculate the strong and electromagnetic decays of heavy hadrons containing one heavy quark @xcite .    in this work",
    "we first derive the mass sum rules for the heavy hybrid mesons and perform the numerical analysis .",
    "then we calculate the pionic couplings between the lightest @xmath0 hybrid @xmath1 and the lowest three heavy meson doublets . invoking @xmath2 flavor symmetry for the coupling constants we calculate the widths for all the possible two - body strong decay processes with a goldstone boson in the final state .",

    "recall in the qcd sum rule analysis of the light hybrid meson masses , the four quark condensate plays a cruicial role @xcite . up to",

    "two approaches are commonly used to deal with this problem .",
    "one is to invoke the vacuum saturation hypothesis @xcite and use the factorization approximation .",
    "the other is to scale the value derived from the vacuum saturation hypothesis by a number . in @xcite",
    "a factor two is used to estimate the four quark condensate value , which introduces large uncertainty .",
    "in contrast , in the framework of hqet , the dominant nonperturbative corrections in the qsr analysis of heavy hybrid meson masses are due to the quark condensate and gluon condensate , which have been determined rather precisely .    in the calculation",

    "the coefficients @xmath84 are collected in table i for @xmath85 .    the contribution from the nonzero light quark mass",
    "is calculated up to the order @xmath86 .",
    "this term is negligible for sum rules involved with up and down quark but it is important when the heavy hybrid meson contains a strange quark as we shall see later .    for the leading order binding energy of heavy hybrid meson we have @xmath87      we use @xmath88 and kept four active flavors with @xmath89 mev .",
    "the tiny up and down quark mass is taken to be zero .",
    "the quark and gluon condensates adpots the standard values @xmath90 the value of the triple gluon condensate is not well known .",
    "in fact several values exist in literature .",
    "we use @xcite @xmath91 which is smaller than the value @xmath92 gev@xmath93 in @xcite and a even larger value @xmath94 gev@xmath93 from the `` instanton liquid '' approach to the qcd vacuum @xcite .",
    "later we will enlarge ( [ ggg ] ) by a factor of ten to see the uncertainty from this source .",
    "there are two commonly used methods to extract the masses , the derivative method and the fitting method . with the derivative method we arrive at ( [ derivative ] ) .",
    "the fitting method involves with fitting the left hand side ( l.h.s . ) and right hand side ( r.h.s . ) of eq .",
    "( [ mass-1 ] ) with the most suitable parameters @xmath95 directly in the working region of the borel parameter . in the numerical analysis , we invoke both methods to crosscheck our results .",
    "we find both methods yield nearly the same results .",
    "we require that ( 1 ) the absolute value of each condensate contribution be less than @xmath96 of the leading perturbative term with continuum subtracted and ( 2 ) the sum of the power corrections be less than one third of the whole sum rule .",
    "this requirement leads to the lower limit of the continuum threshold . typically the triple gluon condensate is less than @xmath97 of the leading term with the value in ( [ ggg ] ) .",
    "the series of the operator expansion converge fast .",
    "we present the numerical values of @xmath98 in table ii .",
    "it is understood that there is an error of @xmath99 gev for @xmath100 . with these values the left hand side and right hand side of ( [ mass-1 ] ) agree within one percent in a large interval of @xmath101 . correspondingly , the ratio between the quark , gluon , triple gluon condensate and the perturbative term is collected in table iii .",
    "the dependence of the binding energy on the borel parameter @xmath101 with different continuum threshold @xmath61 is shown in fig . 2 and 3 for the two exotic hybrid mesons .",
    "we have also plotted the fitting lines and the curves of the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ mass-1 ] ) for @xmath102 in fig . 4 and 5 .    varying @xmath103 from @xmath104mev to @xmath3mev the final result changes within @xmath105 . in our numerical analysis .",
    "if we use @xmath106 , the values of @xmath100 is shifted upwards by @xmath107 for @xmath108 . for the other three channels the best fitting parameters",
    "changes little .",
    "in other words , the uncertainty due to the triple gluon condensate is small and included in the errors given already .",
    "this is in strong contrast with the case for the light hybrid mesons , where the hybrid masses depend cruicially on the value of the triple gluon condensate .",
    "varying its value from @xmath109 to @xmath110 , the @xmath0 hybrid meson mass increases from @xmath111 gev to @xmath112 gev @xcite .",
    "for the numerical analysis of the strange heavy hybrid meson , we use @xmath113 , @xmath114 mev .",
    "the results are collected in table iv and v. as can be seen from table v the strange quark mass correction is very important .",
    "the binding energy of the light component of @xmath115 is roughly @xmath116 mev larger than that for @xmath85 .",
    "the continuum threshold increases by about @xmath117 mev .",
    "the decay constants increase typically by @xmath118 due to the strange quark mass correction .",
    "it is interesting to note that the central value of @xmath119 is much greater than that for the @xmath120 doublet of @xmath121 meson , @xmath122gev .",
    "and the continuum starts at rather large @xmath61 due to the presence of the dynamical gluon in @xmath123 .",
    "the masses of heavy hybrid mesons shall be around @xmath124 .",
    "if we can derive @xmath119 reliably , we have a good estimate of @xmath123 mass . especially for the bottom quark system , the @xmath22 correction is not large .",
    "this point has been the motivation of our considering heavy hybrid mesons with one heavy quark in the framework of hqet .",
    "the uncertainty due to the dimesion six condensates renders the reliable extraction of the light hybrid meson masses rather difficult . in this section",
    "we have calculated the binding energy of the heavy hybrid meson masses in the leading order of hqet with qcd sum rules . within the present approach ( 1 )",
    "the heavy quark mass is disentangled ; ( 2 ) the four quark condensate is of higher order in @xmath69 , hence can be neglected safely ; ( 3 ) the dominant power corrections are from the quark condensate and the gluon condensate , which is well known .",
    "the triple gluon condensate shall at most affect the binding energy by @xmath125 varying its value from @xmath109 to @xmath110 .",

    "the amplitude of the decay process @xmath321 in full qcd is @xmath322 in the limit @xmath320 the decay constant @xmath323 in full qcd is equal to the decay constant @xmath144 defined in hqet .",
    "the decay width formulas in the leading order of hqet are not useful in the present case .",
    "we include the finite @xmath317 correction and use the following decay width formulas .",

    "note summation over charged and neutral pion final states has been performed . in the calculation",
    "we use @xmath328 gev , @xmath329 gev , @xmath330 gev , @xmath331 gev , @xmath332 gev with @xmath333 gev . for the heavy meson with strangeness , we use @xmath334 gev etc .",

    "for example , @xmath337 .",
    "we collect the numerical results of the decay widths for the different channels in table vi .    summing all the two - body strong decay channels with one goldstone boson in the final state , we estimate the total decay width of the lowest lying hybrid meson to be around @xmath3 mev . the dominant decay mode is @xmath338 .",
    "its branching ratio is about @xmath7 .",
    "now we know @xmath211 is a narrow resonance with a width of @xmath339 mev .",
    "so this mode can be used to detect the possible existence of @xmath108 experimentally .",
    "the same characteristic decay modes for the light hybrid mesons have been predicted in the flux tube model @xcite .",
    "in summary we have calculated the binding energy of the heavy hybrid mesons in the leading order of hqet . with the help of the light cone qcd sum rules",
    "we have extracted the pionic couplings between the hybrid @xmath108 and lowest three heavy meson doublets . invoking the flavor @xmath2 symmetry",
    "we have estimated the strong two - body decay widths of @xmath108 with one goldstone boson in the final state .",
    "our calculation yields very characteristic decay modes of @xmath108 and confirms the earlier predictions on the particular decay modes for the light hybrid mesons from the flux tube model .",
