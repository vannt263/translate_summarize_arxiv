    "quasar absorption systems have historically been divided largely into three physically distinct categories : ( i ) absorption systems with strong metal lines arising in or near intervening galaxies , ( ii ) weak h  i  systems in the ly@xmath9  forest that come from the intergalactic medium , and ( iii ) intrinsic systems that are physically related to the quasars , including associated and broad absorption line systems .",
    "metal absorption systems usually contain h  i  lines with relatively large column densities , including two sub - categories : damped lyman alpha ( dla ) system and lyman limit system ( lls ) with h  i  column densities of @xmath2(@xmath3/[@xmath4 ) @xmath11 20.2 and 17.16 , respectively .",
    "deep imaging observations around quasars have provided evidences that the metal absorption systems are often produced in intervening galaxies .",
    "galaxies have been detected that can explain absorption lines ( e.g. , bergeron & boiss 1991 ) , and absorption lines ( e.g. , chen , lanzetta , & webb 2001 ) .    on the other hand , nearly all h  i  lines have smaller column densities ( @xmath6  @xmath13 15 ) than those associated found in gas that shows strong metal lines .",
    "the number of h  i  lines per unit @xmath1 increases with redshift ( peterson 1978 ; weymann et al .",
    "1998a ; bechtold 1994 ) , because the intergalactic medium is denser and less ionized at higher @xmath1 .",
    "the ly@xmath9  absorption lines are produced in intergalactic clouds ( e.g. , sargent et al .",
    "1980 ; melott 1980 ) , which are the higher density regions in the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "the ly@xmath9  lines are broadened by hubble flow ( e.g. , rauch 1998 ; kim et al .",
    "2002a ) as well as the doppler broadening from the gas temperature .",
    "misawa et al .",
    "( 2004 ) presented a study of h  i  absorption lines seen towards 40 quasars in spectra from the keck hires spectrograph . in a departure from prior work , they considered the h  i  lines without considering the metal lines .",
    "they classified the h  i  lines as either high density lines [ hdls ] which have or are near to strong h  i  lines that are probably related to galaxies , and low density lines [ ldls ] that are far from any strong h  i  lines and are more likely to be far from galaxies and hence in the igm .",
    "following misawa et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we define hdls as all h  i  lines within @xmath14 200  of a lines with @xmath15 @xmath0 @xmath6  @xmath0 19  @xmath8 . we define ldls as lines with 12 @xmath0 @xmath6  @xmath0 15 which are within 200  1000  of a line with @xmath16 @xmath6  @xmath0 19  @xmath8 .",
    "this last velocity constraint is intended to make the ldl a `` control '' sample for the hdls , where the two samples come from similar redshifts and regions of the spectra with similar signal to noise .",
    "misawa et al .",
    "( 2004 ) discovered that the hdls have smaller doppler parameters ( @xmath17-values ) , for a given column density than the ldls , and they also found the same effect in a hydrodynamic simulation with 2.7 kpc cells .",
    "misawa et al . ( 2004 ) suggested that the ldls are cool or shock - heated diffuse intergalactic gas , and that the hdls are cooler dense gas near to galaxies .",
    "misawa et al . ( 2004 ) fit all the accessible transitions in the h  ilyman series to help de - blend h  i  lines .",
    "their main sample comprised 86 h  i  absorption systems each with @xmath6  @xmath11 15 @xmath8 .",
    "they also fit all h  i  lines within @xmath141,000  of these h  i  lines , to give a total sample of 1339 h  i  lines , including the 86 lines .",

    "we found 86 h  i  systems with @xmath6@xmath11 15 , at 2.1 @xmath0  @xmath0 4.0 , in 31 of the 40 quasars .",

    "we will call this list sample s0 ( table  3 )",
    ".    when we were fitting the lines , we rejected narrow lines with doppler parameter of @xmath17 @xmath0 4.8 , which corresponds to the resolution of our spectra .",
    "we also identify all lines with @xmath17 @xmath0 15  as possible metal lines ( called in tables ) because h  i  lines with this narrow width are rare ( e.g. , hu et al .",
    "1995 , hereafter h95 ; lu et al . 1996a , hereafter l96 ; kirkman & tytler 1997a , hereafter kt97 ) . if there was more than one way to fit the lines , we chose the fit with the fewest lines .",
    "if the model did not give good fits to all the lyman series lines , we adopted the model that best fit the lower order lines where the snr is best . for h",
    "i  lines with column densities of @xmath6  @xmath7 16.6 the lyman continuum optical depth is @xmath30 @xmath7 0.25 . for these systems we checked if the residual flux at the lyman limit was consistent . our fitting method could readily overestimate the doppler parameter but not the column density . once the fitting model is chosen , we used @xmath31 minimization in a code written by david kirkman , to get the best fit parameters of h  icolumn density ( @xmath6 ) , doppler parameter ( @xmath17 ) , and absorption redshift ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the internal errors are typically @xmath32(@xmath6)=0.09  @xmath8 , @xmath32(@xmath17)=2.1  , and @xmath32(@xmath1)=2.5@xmath33@xmath34 .",
    "we prepared a sample s1 that is a sub - sample of s0 including only 973 h  i  lines and 61 h  i  systems with @xmath6  @xmath11 15 .",
    "s1 excludes 25 systems with difficulties such as ( i ) poor fitting due to gaps in the echelle formatted spectra , ( ii ) poor fitting due to strong dla wings ( i.e. , @xmath6  @xmath11 19 ) , ( iii ) close proximity in redshift to the background quasars ( i.e. , within 1,000  of the emission redshift ) , and ( iv ) overlapping with other h  i  systems .",
    "the s / n ratios of the spectra are at least s / n @xmath35 11 per 2.1  pixel and the mean value is s / n @xmath35 47 for ly@xmath9  lines . among these 61 h  i  systems , three systems may be physically associated with the quasars based on the partial coverage analysis for the corresponding metal absorption lines ( misawa et al .",
    "2007 ) . however , we keep these systems in s1 sample , because we still can not reject the idea that they are intervening systems .",
    "we give detailed descriptions of all the lines that we fit in the appendix .",
    "we also give velocity plots of the first five lyman transitions , ly@xmath9 , ly@xmath28 , ly@xmath36 , ly@xmath37 , and ly@xmath29 .",
    "we investigate the properties of line parameters such as the column density , doppler parameter , and the clustering properties of the h  ilines .",
    "since this sample contains not only h  i  lines originating in the intergalactic diffuse gas clouds ( i.e. , ldls ) , but also h  i  lines produced by intervening galaxies ( i.e. , hdls ) , we also attempted to separate h  i  lines into hdls and ldls based on the clustering trend ( misawa et a. 2004 ) .",
    "our analysis is similar to that of previous studies ( e.g. , h95 ; l96 ; kt97 ) , but with three key differences : ( i ) earlier studies used all h  i  lines detected in the quasar spectra , whereas we use only h  ilines within @xmath14 1,000  of the main components with @xmath6@xmath7 15 , ( ii ) our sample contains a number of strong lines ( @xmath6@xmath7 15 ) in addition to weak h  i  lines ( @xmath6  @xmath0 15 ) , and ( iii ) our sample covers a wide redshift range : 2.0 @xmath13  @xmath13 4.0 . the redshift distributions of the 86 and 61 h  i  systems in samples s0 and s1 are shown in figure  1 .      for further investigation",
    ", we prepared several sub - samples as follow .",
    "it is known that the comoving number densities of low - ionization lines , such as h  i  lines , decreases in the vicinity of quasars ( carswell et al .",
    "1982 ; murdoch et al .",
    "1986 ; tytler 1987 ) .",
    "this trend is known as the `` proximity effect '' , and is probably caused by the enhanced uv flux from the quasar towards which the absorption is seen .",
    "we separate the 61 h  i  systems ( sample s1 ) into sub - samples s2a ( the velocity difference from the quasar , @xmath38 @xmath11 5,000  ) and s2b ( @xmath38 @xmath0 5,000  ) .",
    "we have already removed from s1 all h  i  systems within 1,000  of the quasars to avoid h  i  systems from the quasar host galaxies .    h95 emphasized that the line detection limit is almost wholly determined by the line blending ( or blanketing ) , and not by the s / n ratio of the spectrum . in order to confirm whether the distribution of line parameters is affected by the quality of the spectrum , we made two overlapping samples from s1 using the s / n ratio of each spectrum in the ly@xmath9  region : s3a ( s / n @xmath7 40 ) , and s3b ( s / n @xmath7 70 ) .",
    "these sub - samples include 34 ( @xmath39 60% ) and 17 ( @xmath39 30% ) of the 61 h  i  systems of the sample s1 .",
    "sample s1 covers a broader range of redshifts , @xmath40 , when compared with previous studies : @xmath41 for h95 , @xmath42 for l96 , and @xmath43 for kt97 .",
    "when we investigate the redshift evolution of h  i  absorbers , we also divided s1 into two sub - samples ; s4a ( @xmath12 ) and s4b ( @xmath44 ) . here",
    "the two sub - samples have nearly the same number of h  i  systems .    finally , we made sub - samples according to the column densities of h  ilines , as the distributional trends of strong and weak h  i  lines are very different ( see figure  2 in misawa et al .",
    "2004 ) ; the h  i  lines with relatively large column densities tend to cluster around the main components , while the number of weak h  i  lines decreases near the center of h  i  systems because of line blanketing .",
    "since one of our interests is to determine the boundary value of column density between hdls and ldls ( although other parameters may be necessary to separate them ) , we separate the 973 h  i  lines into eight sub - samples according to their column densities .",
    "we use boundary values of @xmath45 = 13 , 14 , 15 , and 16 , where sub - sample s5@xmath46 contains h  i  lines whose column densities are @xmath2(@xmath3/[@xmath4 ) values of a to b.    in table  3 we summarize these 16 sub - samples . here",
    "we should emphasize that s5@xmath47 , s5@xmath48 , s5@xmath49 , s5@xmath50 , s5@xmath51 , s5@xmath52 , s5@xmath53 , and s5@xmath54 , are separated by the properties of lines , while s2a , s2b , s3a , s3b , s4a , and s4b are separated by the unit of system .",
    "for each sub - sample prepared in the last section , we perform statistical analysis , including analysis of the column density distribution , doppler parameter distribution , and line clustering properties .",

    "the plot in figure  2 is the result for sub - sample s1 . since the turn - over of the distribution around @xmath6  = 12.5 is probably due to line blending and/or blanketing as described later in   4 , we fit the column density distributions only for @xmath6  @xmath11 13 .",
    "the best - fitting parameters , @xmath28 and @xmath57 , as well as the redshift bandpass , @xmath58 , of each sub - sample are summarized in table  4 , along with the past results from kt97 and petitjean et al .",

    "the indices that we find , @xmath28 = 1.40@xmath140.03 , are slightly smaller than the value in the past results , @xmath28 = 1.46 1.55 , which means that our sample favors strong h  i  lines .",
    "but we expect this type of trend .",
    "our samples contain not only ldls but also hdls , and since we cover only the velocity regions within @xmath14 1,000  of the main components , we have a strong excess of strong h  ilines .",
    "we see the column density distribution does not change with the velocity distance from the quasars ( s2a and s2b ) or with the s / n ratio ( s3a and s3b ) , but it is weakly affected by redshift ( s4a and s4b ) .",

    "the total amount of broadening is given by @xmath65 .    in order to determine the correct doppler parameter",
    ", we have to individually resolve and fit h  i  lines using voigt profiles . however , most of weak h  i  lines disappear in the observed spectrum due to line blending and blanketing , especially near strong lines . to derive the intrinsic (",
    "as opposed to observed ) distribution of the doppler parameter , previous authors ( i.e. , h95 ; l96 ; kt97 ) have chosen artificial h  i  lines ( as input data ) with distributions characterized by a gaussian , and used them for comparison with the observed distributions .",
    "kt97 noted that the @xmath17-value distribution of lines seen in simulated spectra resembles the distribution of the input data , except for two differences : ( i ) an excess of lines with large @xmath17-values is seen in the recovered data , compared to the input data , which is probably produced by line blending , and ( ii ) lines with very small @xmath17-values ( @xmath17 @xmath0 15  ) are found , which are probably data defects or noise , as they are not present in the input data .",
    "nonetheless , the @xmath17-value distribution of the input and recovered data resemble each other between @xmath17 = 20  and @xmath17 = 60  .",
    "we would ideally like to determine the real distribution of doppler parameters ; however , the only way to do this is to perform simulations , and compare the recovered doppler parameter distribution with the observed distribution .",
    "such simulations are expensive to perform , so in this work we simply compared the distribution in our sample with the past results of h95 and l96 at @xmath17 = 20  60  .",

    "this trend , shown in figure  7 , means that there is a deficit of relatively stronger ldls ( i.e. , @xmath6  @xmath7 14.5 ) at lower redshift .",
    "one of the possible explanations is that at lower redshift , more h  i  lines with the column densities just below @xmath6  = 15 ( i.e. , relatively strong ldls ) might be associated with hdls . in other words , stronger ( i.e. , @xmath6  = 14.5  15 ) ldls get into within 200  of the nearest hdls , and would be classified into hdls , which is consistent with the trend expected in the hierarchical clustering model ( figure  8) .    as for the doppler parameter distribution",
    ", we did not find any remarkable redshift evolutions in neither hdls nor ldls .",
    "l96 claimed that there is a redshift evolution of the doppler parameter between @xmath1 = 2.8 and 3.7 ; the mean value of doppler parameter at  = 3.7 ( @xmath60 = 23  ; l96 ) is smaller than the value at  = 2.8 ( @xmath60 = 28  ; h95 ) .",
    "the corresponding value in kt97 ( @xmath70 ) is , however , different from the result in h95 .",
    "the difference may be due to the different line fitting procedure used in these studies ; l96 and kt97 used the vpfit software , while h95 used different software .",
    "especially important is how the authors chose to treat blended lines .",
    "the difference could be related to the difference of the spectrum resolutions ; r=45000 ( l96 ; kt97 ) and r=36000 ( h95 ) .",
    "janknecht et al .",
    "( 2006 ) did not detect any evolution on the doppler parameter at @xmath1 = 0.5  1.9 .",
    "our results , which are based on the data set taken with one observational configuration and fit using the same procedure , suggests that the doppler parameter distribution of h  i  clouds does not evolve with redshift at @xmath1 = 2  4 .",
    "it has long been noted that the number of ly@xmath9  lines decreases near to the redshift of the quasars ( carswell et al .",
    "1982 ; murdoch et al . 1986 ; tytler 1987 ) .",
    "this phenomenon is related to the local excess of uv flux from the quasars .",
    "the proximity effect has been used to evaluate the intensity of the background uv flux .",
    "bajtlik et al .",
    "( 1988 ) first measured the mean intensity of the background uv intensity , @xmath71 = @xmath72 ( erg s@xmath19 @xmath8 hz@xmath19 str@xmath19 ) at the lyman limit at 1.7 @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath0 3.8 , by estimating the distance from the quasar at which the quasar flux is equal to the background uv flux .",
    "the typical radius is @xmath39 5  mpc in physical scale that corresponds to the velocity shift of @xmath38 @xmath39 4,000  from the quasars .",
    "l96 also evaluated the background uv intensity to be @xmath71 = @xmath73 ( erg s@xmath19 @xmath8 hz@xmath19 str@xmath19 ) at @xmath1 @xmath39 4.1 in the spectrum of q0000 - 26 .",
    "we see two differences in ldls within 5,000  of the quasars , compared to those far from the quasars ( @xmath38 @xmath11 5,000  ) .",
    "we see fewer strong ldls leading to a large index for the column density power law , @xmath28 = 1.90@xmath140.16 ( figure  9 ) .",
    "we also see that the distribution of doppler parameter is different from that of h  i  lines far from the quasars at 98.8  % confidence level .",
    "the lines near to the quasar apparently tend to have broader lines ( figures  5 and 6 ) , although this is a tentative result because we consider few lines near to the quasars .",
    "these results could be accounted for by assuming a two - phase structure : outer cold low - density regions and inner hot high - density regions in which temperature is determined by the competition between photoionization heating and adiabatic cooling .",
    "when gas is near to the quasars , the outer regions become too highly ionized to show much , and only the inner hot regions would be observed in , which would increase the mean value of the doppler parameter .",
    "the increased ionization also decreases the total column densities of gas compared with gas far from the quasars ( figure  10 ) . as reported in the past observations ( e.g. , kim et al .",
    "2001 ; misawa et al .",
    "2004 ) , @xmath6  and @xmath17(h  i ) have a positive correlation for @xmath6  @xmath0 15 .",
    "this correlations was also reproduced by hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. , zhang et al .",
    "1997 ; misawa et al .",
    "these results suggest that high density regions tend to have larger doppler parameters , if the absorbers are not optically thick .",
    "dav et al .",
    "( 1999 ) also presented an interesting plot in their figure  11 that supported there existed three kinds of phases for h  i  absorbers ( diffuse , shocked , and condensed phases ) . among them , the diffuse phase whose volume densities are small ( i.e. , it corresponds to ldls in our paper ) has a positive correlation between @xmath6  and @xmath17 . on the other hand ,",
    "an anti - correlation between @xmath6  and @xmath17 is seen only for the condensed phase with high volume density that is probably associated with galaxies .",
    "the shocked phase , probably consisting of shock - heated gas in galaxies , does not show any remarkable correlations between them .",
    "thus , if we assume all ldls in our sample arise in the diffuse phase absorbers , our scenario above could reproduce the difference between sub - samples s2a and s2b .",
    "the number density evolution of h  i  absorbers ( i.e. , @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 ) has been known to slow dramatically at @xmath1 @xmath39 1.6 , from a high-@xmath1 rapid evolution with @xmath36 of 1.85@xmath140.27 ( bechtold 1994 ) to a low-@xmath1 slow evolution with @xmath36 of 0.16@xmath140.16 ( weymann et al .",
    "this trend is suggested to be due to the decline in the extragalactic background radiation using hydrodynamic cosmological simulations ( e.g. , theuns , leonard , & efstathiou 1998 ) .",
    "thus , a comparison of h  i  absorbers at high-@xmath1 and local universe is another interesting topic .    in   3 , we found that the column density distribution of ldls at @xmath1 @xmath0 2.9 ( @xmath28 = 1.71@xmath140.06 ) is steeper than that at @xmath1 @xmath11 2.9 ( @xmath28 = 1.52@xmath140.09 ) .",
    "we proposed this trend could be due to the hierarchical clustering .",
    "if the assembly of structure in the igm indeed dominates the column density distribution , we would expect to find a steeper column density distributions at lower redshift as proposed in   4.1 .    using the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) and the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",
    "( _ fuse _ ) , penton , stocke , & shull ( 2004 ) and lehner et al .",

    "dav & tripp ( 2001 ) found a flatter distribution ( @xmath28 = 2.04@xmath140.23 ) at @xmath1 @xmath0 0.3 .",
    "the latter steeper distribution was also reproduced by hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. , theuns et al . 1998 ) .",
    "if we accept the steeper result , the column density distribution would continue to be steeper as going to the lower redshift , which supports our idea that the hierarchical clustering could play a main role of the evolution seen in the column density distribution , although extragalactic radiation would contribute to play a role .",
    "absorption line width is another parameter that is still in argument whether it would evolve with redshift or not , as mentioned in   4.1 . while most of the space - based ultraviolet observations could not measure line widths by model fittings because of the lacks of spectral resolutions , lehner et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for the first time measured doppler parameters of h  i  absorption lines accurately at lower redshift ( @xmath1 @xmath0 0.4 ) , and investigate their distributional trend . by comparing to the results at higher redshift , lehner et al .",
    "( 2007 ) discovered that doppler parameters are monotonously increasing from @xmath1 = 3.1 to @xmath390 .",
    "such a trend was not confirmed in past papers ( e.g. , janknecht et al .",
    "2006 ) . the fraction of the broad ly@xmath9  absorbers ( bla ; @xmath17 @xmath7 40  ) is also confirmed to increase by a factor of @xmath393 from @xmath1 @xmath39 3 to 0 ( lehner et al .",
    "here , @xmath17 = 40  corresponds to gas temperature of @xmath77 @xmath39 @xmath78  k , which is a border between the cool photoionized absorbers and the highly ionized warm - hot absorbers .",
    "these results suggests that a large fraction of h  i  absorbers at very low redshift ( i.e. , @xmath1 @xmath0 0.4 ) are hotter and/or more kinematically disturbed than at higher redshift ( i.e. , @xmath1 @xmath11 2.0 ) .    in our sample",
    ", we do not see any clear difference of mean / median doppler parameter at @xmath1 @xmath7 2.9 ( @xmath79 = 31.0@xmath1410.0 , @xmath80 = 28.1 ) and @xmath1 @xmath0 2.9 ( @xmath79 = 32.0@xmath1410.9 , @xmath80 = 29.6 ) .",
    "neither hdls nor ldls shows any evolutional trends .",
    "these negative results could be because with our optical data we covered only higher redshift regions than @xmath1 @xmath39 1.6 , at which @xmath74 evolution dramatically changed .",
    "similarly , the fraction of the bla ( @xmath81 = 0.182 at @xmath1 @xmath7 2.9 and 0.196 at @xmath1 @xmath0 2.9 ) shows an only marginal hint to the evolution .",
    "however , these fractions are consistent to the result from kt97 ( @xmath81 = 0.179 ; lehner et al . 2007 ) at 2.43 @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath0 3.05 that is similar redshift coverage as our sample .",
    "thus , doppler parameter could increase as going to the lower redshift , but such a trend would be remarkable only if we trace its distribution at very low redshift ( at @xmath1 @xmath0 0.4 ) and compare it to that at much higher redshift ( at @xmath1 @xmath11 2 ) .    as for the clustering trend of h  i  absorption lines ,",
    "we see a very similar property at low and high redshift regions .",
    "as presented in figure  4 , we found a strong clustering trend within @xmath38  of 200  for h  i  lines with @xmath6  between 15 and 19 , while only a weak correlation is seen for weaker h  i  lines within @xmath38  of 100  .",
    "penton et al .",
    "( 2004 ) presented very similar results : 5@xmath32 ( 7.2@xmath32 ) excess within @xmath38  of 190  ( 260  ) and only stronger h  i  lines contribute to this clustering .",
    "penton , stock , & shull ( 2002 ) proposed such clustering trends within several hundreds of  are due to clusters of galaxies .",
    "there could exist similar kinematical structures both at high-@xmath1 and in local universe .      for a statistical analysis , especially the number density analysis ,",
    "the completeness of the h  i  line detection is influenced by the detection limit of absorption lines ( e.g. , equivalent width or column density ) . in this study , we have used the h  i  lines detected in the 40 hires spectra that have various s / n ratios .",
    "the strong line sample will have subtle biases arising from the selection of the quasars because they were once thought to be good targets for the detection of deuterium .",
    "for example , we avoided quasars with no llss , and we avoided llss with previously known complex velocity structure .",
    "nevertheless , we confirmed that our sample is almost complete for weak lines in the following way .",
    "the minimum detectable equivalent width in the observed - frame , @xmath82 , can be estimated using the following relation , @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the numbers of pixels over which the equivalent width and the continuum level ( @xmath86 ) are determined ( young et al .",

    "2002 ) . here",

    "thus , our sample is complete for h  i  lines with @xmath6  @xmath11 12.3",
    ". therefore , the bend in the column density distribution near @xmath6  @xmath39 13 is probably due to the line blending and blanketing .",
    "we present 40 high - resolutional ( fwhm = 8.0  ) spectra obtained with keck+hires . over the wide column density range ( 12 @xmath0 @xmath6@xmath0 19 ) , we fit h  i  lines by voigt profiles using not only ly@xmath9  line but also higher lyman series lines such as ly@xmath28  and ly@xmath36  up to lyman limit when possible .",

    "<S> we found two interesting trends for lines with 12 @xmath0 @xmath2(@xmath10/[@xmath4 ) @xmath0 15 which are within 200  1000  of systems with @xmath2(@xmath3/[@xmath4 ) @xmath11 15 . </S>",
    "<S> first , their column density distribution becomes steeper , meaning relatively fewer high column density lines , at @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> second , their column density distribution also becomes steeper and their line width becomes broader by about 23  when they are within 5,000  of their quasar . </S>"
