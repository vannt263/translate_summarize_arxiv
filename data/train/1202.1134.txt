    "this paper is devoted to propagation of singularities in linear hyperbolic partial differential equations with non - smooth coefficients in the framework of the colombeau theory of generalized functions @xcite .",
    "such equations involve a nonlinear interaction of coefficient singularities with those in the solution which emanate from the initial data . in the past years",
    ", this problem has been investigated intensively in a series of papers , in which the coefficients and the solution have been viewed as elements of the colombeau algebra of generalized function .",
    "so far , microlocal elliptic regularity is well understood for general equations and systems in this framework @xcite .",
    "further , generalized fourier integral operators have been introduced in order to describe the wave front set of generalized solutions @xcite .",
    "these methods have allowed to describe the propagation of singularities in scalar first order hyperbolic equations with generalized function coefficients @xcite . as a new phenomenon",
    ", the colombeau wave front set has been shown to possess a more refined structure than the corresponding distributional wave front set @xcite . for a survey of these methods and relations to various classical approaches",
    "we refer to @xcite .    in the special situation of hyperbolic equations and systems with piecewise constant coefficients ( with possibly jumps across smooth hypersurfaces ) ,",
    "the problem may be interpreted as a transmission problem and can be solved classically by a piecewise distributional solution . in case of systems or higher order equations , an incoming singularity will split at the interface into a refracted and a reflected wave . while in many cases it has been shown that the colombeau solution is associated with the distributional solution of the transmission problem @xcite , the task of identifying the refracted and reflected singularity by means of the colombeau wave front set  directly in the generalized solution without considering the associated distribution  has remained open .    the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate  in a simple model problem  that the splitting of singularities at an interface can indeed be observed in the colombeau solution . at the same time",
    ", the effect depends on the interplay of the scale of regularization of coefficients and data .",
    "we consider the cauchy problem for the one - dimensional wave equation with a discontinuous coefficient depending on time @xmath0 we will seek solutions in the colombeau algebra @xmath1 of generalized functions , which will be defined in section @xmath2 below .",
    "the colombeau algebras are constructed as factor algebras of nets of smooth functions , depending on a regularization parameter .",
    "they are differential algebras ; the space of distributions can be imbedded as a subspace using regularization by convolution with a friedrichs mollifier .",
    "the initial data as well as the coefficient will be taken from the algebra @xmath3 , which contains the space @xmath4 of distributions .    as a model situation",
    ", we consider the case when @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the heaviside function and @xmath11 is the delta function .",
    "the singularity of the initial data propagates from the origin in the two characteristic directions until it hits the coefficient discontinuity at time @xmath12 . as the coefficient has a discontinuity in time",
    ", the singular support is expected to split at time @xmath12 into a transmitted and a refracted part . in the classical setting",
    ", the piecewise distributional solution exhibits this splitting",
    ". we will demonstrate the occurrence of the splitting effect in the colombeau setting as well , using the generalized singular support .",
    "however , in the colombeau setting the effect depends on the scale in terms of the regularization parameter .",
    "if the initial data and the coefficient are regularized on the same scale , both the transmitted and the refracted ray will be shown to belong to the colombeau singular support .",
    "if the coefficient is regularized by means of a slow scale mollifier , only the transmitted ray belongs to the colombeau singular support .    in order to be able to observe this effect",
    ", we have to prove a new existence result for the cauchy problem ( [ eqn : wave equation ] ) which does not restrict the choice of scale for the regularization of the coefficient .",
    "the equation can be rewritten as a one - dimensional first - order hyperbolic system with discontinuous coefficients in the colombeau algebra of generalized functions .",
    "this transformation will be used in the existence and regularity results .",
    "we also demonstrate that the colombeau solution has the piecewise solution of the transmission problem as its associated distribution .",
    "that is , the nets defining the colombeau solution converge to the piecewise distributional solution .",
    "this latter argument relies on energy estimates .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we recall the definition and basic properties of the colombeau algebra @xmath13 in section @xmath2 . in section @xmath14 , we show that problem @xmath15 is uniquely solvable in the colombeau algebra @xmath16 without restriction on the scale of regularization of the coefficient ( theorem [ thm : existence and uniqueness ] ) .",
    "the problem of propagation of singularities is addressed in section @xmath17 ( theorem [ thm : propagation1 ] ) .",
    "the question whether the regularity of the coefficient affects that of the solution is discussed in section [ sec : 5 ] ( theorem [ thm : propagation2 ] ) . in section [ sec : 6 ] , we show that the colombeau generalized solutions to problem ( [ eqn : wave equation ] ) with arbitrary distributions as initial data admit the piecewise distributional solutions of the corresponding transmission problem as associated distributions ( theorem [ thm : associated distribution ] ) .",
