    "rotating bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) provide a highly controllable and versatile experimental platform for the study of fundamental aspects of superfluidity and turbulence @xcite . following the creation of quantized vortices @xcite",
    ", experiments have studied the formation of large - scale vortex lattices @xcite , the role of vortices in the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless phase transition @xcite , and their appearance as topological defects in the kibble - zurek mechanism @xcite .",
    "more recently , advances in real - time vortex imaging @xcite and experimental control of vortex creation @xcite have accompanied a growing interest in quantized vortex turbulence , from both experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite perspectives .    nucleating vortices in a bec is possible using a variety of techniques that can impart angular momentum to the system , such as internal state manipulation @xcite , stirring using a laser beam @xcite , dynamically manipulating the trapping potential @xcite , and topological phase imprinting @xcite . following a period of induced rotation ,",
    "a single - component bec is in a highly non - equilibrium state as vortices nucleate .",
    "like - signed vortices subsequently crystallize into a regular lattice , usually of a triangular geometry @xcite .",
    "other lattice geometries are also possible .",
    "for example , square lattices can form in the presence of dipolar interactions @xcite or in two - components gases @xcite .",
    "this emerging order is indicative of the system relaxing to a lowest - energy equilibrium state .",
    "the time scale for the lattice to form can be either dependent @xcite or independent @xcite of temperature , depending on the particular stirring mechanism used @xcite , with dissipation mechanisms involving the thermal component playing a role in the former case and dynamic instability in the latter . while much theoretical attention has been given to vortex lattice formation",
    "in stirred two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems @xcite , a comparatively smaller body of work exists for the three - dimensional ( 3d ) regime @xcite . a careful study , both experimentally and theoretically , of the regime in - between vortex nucleation and crystallization of the lattice may elucidate the mechanisms of energy dissipation in both 2d and 3d geometries .",
    "there is a stark qualitative difference between the disordered collection of vortices present initially in a rapidly rotating bec and the ordered lattice that subsequently forms as the system relaxes into a lower - energy configuration .",
    "the number of vortices present along with their configuration characterize the rotational equilibrium states of an irrotational fluid which minimize the free energy of the system .",
    "theoretically , one can quantify the order of a vortex lattice by comparing the free energy of a given configuration of vortices to the free energy of the lowest - energy equilibrium state @xcite .",
    "previously , attempts have been made to quantify order in vortex lattices by examining pair correlations @xcite , although comparisons between ordered and disordered vortex distributions were only made qualitatively . in superconductor vortex lattices , which also exhibit a triangular geometry @xcite , disorder has been quantified by calculating translational and orientational correlations , as well as by examining clusters of lattice defects @xcite .    in this work ,",

    "@xcite and gently revolve an anharmonic magnetic quadrupole potential which contributes to the confinement of the condensate .",
    "the anharmonicity of the potential couples the center - of - mass motion of the condensate to its internal motion and thereby imparts angular momentum , akin to how a wine connoisseur swirls wine in a glass prior to tasting .",
    "we describe an automated vortex detection algorithm suitable for use with large data sets .",
    "we focus particularly on the systematic analysis of lattice disorder using simple numerical techniques that provide a heuristic measure of lattice energy via two different metrics .",
    "the first metric is based on the single distance scale present in an equilateral triangular geometry , and the second is derived from fitting a triangular lattice to a vortex distribution . using these metrics ,",
    "we track the evolution of the system from a disordered arrangement of vortices to an ordered lattice , observing a clear transition to an ordered state .",
    "details of our experimental apparatus have been described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "@xmath0rb atoms are initially cooled in a magneto - optical trap before being optically pumped into the @xmath1 state and transferred to the science cell ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : experimentschematic ] ) using a mechanical magnetic transport scheme @xcite . here",
    "the atoms are loaded into a magnetic quadrupole trap where they undergo forced radio - frequency evaporation until the lifetime becomes limited by majorana spin flips . at this point , we transfer the atoms into a hybrid optical and magnetic trap @xcite by linearly ramping the quadrupole gradient from 180 down to 30  g / cm .",
    "the hybrid trap consists of a crossed optical dipole trap positioned @xmath2 m below the field zero of the weak quadrupole potential .",
    "the dipole trap is formed from a versatile _ moving beam _ which crosses at 90@xmath3 with a second beam , referred to as the _ waveguide _ , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : experimentschematic ] .",
    "the trapping light is provided by a multi - mode 1070  nm fiber laser ( ylr-50 - 1070-lp from ipg photonics ) , with the moving and waveguide beams having waist sizes of 68(3 ) and 112(3 )  @xmath4 m , respectively .",
    "the position of the moving beam is controlled using an acousto - optic deflector , which is capable of deflecting the beam up to 3  mm with sub - micron precision at modulation frequencies greater than 1  mhz .",
    "this allows us to generate time - averaged traps by rapidly dithering the beam position @xcite , which is utilized in the experiment described here , as well as to transport the atoms over several millimeters with high precision @xcite .    .",
    "the solid arrows on the coils indicate direction of current flow , while the dashed blue line illustrates the rotating magnetic field .",
    "the combined optical and magnetic potential ( solid blue line ) is plotted in ( b ) . for comparison , a harmonic fit to the potential",
    "is also shown ( purple dashed line ) .",
    "the position of the bec as it spirals out from its initial position over the 50  ms of driving time is shown in ( c ) .",
    "the positions are measured at 2.5  ms intervals after 12  ms of time of flight . ]",
    "in addition to the magnetic quadrupole coils , our apparatus contains three sets of shim coils used to apply small ( @xmath5  g ) magnetic fields allowing the position of the magnetic field zero to be precisely controlled .",
    "the positioning of the crossed dipole trap relative to the field zero is crucial for the rotation experiments described here as this determines the frequency and anharmonicity of the trapping potential .",
    "the set of bias coils also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : experimentschematic ] can provide larger fields and are used in levitated time of flight .",
    "the hybrid trap is initially loaded using beam powers of 7.8 and 5.6  w for the moving and waveguide beams , respectively .",
    "note that this does not result in an equal contribution to the trap depth from the two beams ; the lower power used in the waveguide is due to a technical constraint in our setup .",
    "we begin optical evaporation by first linearly reducing the power in the moving beam until the trap depth it provides matches that of the waveguide in the horizontal plane .",
    "we then simultaneously linearly reduce the power of both beams to drive evaporation in stages interspersed with periods of constant power , where the atoms undergo passive evaporation .",
    "this produces becs of 8.3(1 )  @xmath6 atoms in a final trapping geometry of @xmath7  hz .",
    "several groups have reported intensity - dependent optical pumping from @xmath8 to @xmath9 in @xmath0rb by trapping light generated by multi - mode fiber lasers @xcite .",
    "we have also observed this .",

    "@xcite , who use the same model of laser , found that the effect was minimized below an intensity on the order of 1  kw / mm@xmath10 .",
    "this corresponds to the maximum intensity used in our experiment , and we consequently see only minimal transfer to @xmath9 of approximately 1@xmath11 . despite the associated heating and atom loss from our desired state , we are able to create becs with lifetimes of many seconds , giving us ample time to perform the experiments described here .    to study vortex dynamics , we must first transfer the bec into a trap where the confinement in the @xmath12 plane is dominated by an anharmonic potential @xcite . to achieve this",
    ", we remove the waveguide beam and dither the position of the moving beam to reduce the horizontal confinement from the dipole trap .",
    "the optical potential now only provides confinement in the @xmath13 direction with confinement in the @xmath12 plane being provided by the magnetic quadrupole potential , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the magnetic moment of the atoms , @xmath16 is the magnetic field gradient along @xmath13 , and @xmath17 is the position of field zero with respect to the dipole trap . at the initial field zero position @xmath18 m",
    ", this potential is approximately harmonic over the size of the atomic cloud with a frequency given by @xmath19  hz . by bringing the field zero much closer to the dipole beam ( i.e. , reducing @xmath17 ) the range over which the potential is harmonic is reduced and the trapping in the horizontal plane becomes tighter and strongly anharmonic as @xmath17 becomes comparable to the cloud size . the final potential in the @xmath20 direction is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : experimentschematic](b ) .        to create this new trap , we first ramp up the moving beam power over 50  ms to compensate for the reduction in trap depth in the time - averaged potential .",
    "we then reduce the waveguide power to zero over 150  ms . to broaden the moving beam potential",
    ", we apply a 5  khz modulation , increasing the amplitude linearly over 500  ms to its final value of 70  @xmath4 m . the quadrupole field zero",
    "is then shifted vertically towards the atoms using the @xmath13 shim coils . at the end of a 50  ms linear ramp ,",
    "the field zero is positioned 28(1 )  @xmath15 m above the dipole trapping beam .",
    "we infer this distance from trapping frequency measurements .",
    "although this potential is anharmonic , for very small horizontal displacements , effective trapping frequencies can be measured from small amplitude trap oscillations .",
    "we measure these frequencies to be @xmath21 $ ]  hz .",
    "the thomas - fermi radii of the condensate in this trap are approximately 27  @xmath15 m horizontally and 33  @xmath15 m vertically .",
    "to impart rotation into the system , we displace the magnetic field zero , thus shifting the trap center .",
    "the position of the field zero is rotated by sinusoidally modulating the current in the @xmath20 and @xmath22 shim coils at 37  hz , close to the trapping frequencies , for 50  ms using two phase - synchronized channels of a function generator @xmath23 out of phase .",
    "this is a delicate process ; the amplitude of the resultant quadrupole field displacement is only @xmath245@xmath15 m , and it is crucial that any stray magnetic fields are completely nulled .",
    "the resulting center - of - mass motion of the bec is mapped out in fig .  [",
    "fig : experimentschematic](c ) .",
    "it is elliptical due to a small fixed deviation in phase from @xmath23 between the @xmath20 and @xmath22 modulation signals .    once the trap rotation is complete , we hold the atoms in the now static trap for varying lengths of time to allow the system to evolve and equilibrate .",
    "we release the atoms from the trap and , following 42  ms of time of flight , image the cloud with a magnification of 3.1 using a resonant probe beam propagating along @xmath13 . for 40  ms of the time of flight",
    "the atoms are levitated against gravity to prevent them from falling out of the focus of the vertical imaging system .",
    "relaxation times between 250  ms and 10  s at 250  ms intervals are chosen , with 10 repeats at each time .",
    "each data point comes from a unique experimental run , and relaxation times are randomized to minimize effects from any long - term drifts in experimental conditions .",
    "[ fig : latticeevolution ] shows images at several different relaxation times , illustrating the evolution of the system from center - of - mass motion to nucleation of vortices , ordering of vortices into a triangular lattice , and subsequent decay as the angular momentum of the bec decreases due to friction with the thermal cloud @xcite .",

    "we first fourier filter a given absorption image to remove interference fringes from the probe light .",
    "the filtered image is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : blobdetection](a ) .",
    "then by convolving the image @xmath26 with a gaussian kernel @xmath27 with a width set by the vortex core size in the expanded cloud , we obtain a _ scale space _",

    "a laplacian of this convolution produces positive features for intensity minima , which correspond to the vortex cores [ fig .",
    "[ fig : blobdetection](c ) ] . using an amplitude threshold @xmath30 , the resulting image is converted to a binary image [ fig .",
    "[ fig : blobdetection](d ) ] , and a size threshold of @xmath31 contiguous pixels is then applied to discard small features that originate from , e.g. , spurious dark pixels resulting from imaging artifacts .",
    "the vortex positions are finally extracted by determining the `` center of mass '' of each collection of contiguous pixels .",
    "we set @xmath29 to 1.2 pixels , which is approximately the gaussian width of a vortex , and set @xmath31 to 3 pixels .",
    "@xmath30 is chosen based on the peak values in fig .",
    "[ fig : blobdetection](c ) . varying @xmath29 and @xmath30 by less than 5@xmath11 results in a variation of @xmath321 detected vortex in a given image . changing @xmath31 by @xmath321 pixels results in a variation of @xmath322 vortices in images with higher numbers of vortices and has less of an effect on images with fewer vortices .",
    "false positive detected vortices stem primarily from spurious dark pixels , and they considerably affect subsequent measurements of disorder .",
    "we deliberately choose detection parameters that are more likely to undercount vortices than to detect false positives for this reason .",
    "the detection algorithm ultimately performs well for images with good contrast , but struggles with detecting vortices in cases where the contrast is reduced , such as near the edge of a cloud or if vortices are not perfectly aligned along the vertical imaging axis .",
    "we note that the same detection parameters are applied to the entire data set .",
    "we take two different approaches to quantify disorder that are minimally sensitive to imperfections in vortex detection .",
    "the first approach makes use of the fact that in a triangular lattice , the nearest neighbors of a given lattice site are equidistant from it .",
    "we define the geometric disorder as @xmath33 @xcite , where @xmath34 is the standard deviation of nearest neighbour distances and @xmath35 is the mean nearest - neighbor distance . in a perfectly ordered triangular lattice , @xmath36 . using a nearest - neighbors search algorithm ,",
    "we first analyze the distribution of up to seven vortices nearest to the center of the cloud and use this to estimate the average nearest neighbor - distance @xmath37 .",
    "this is then used to define a search radius @xmath38 for the full nearest - neighbor search , where @xmath39 is the height of an equilateral triangle with sides of length @xmath37 , such that the radius @xmath40 falls midway between the nearest and next - nearest neighbor distance for a perfect triangular lattice . for each vortex in a cloud , the distances between it and all other vortices within @xmath40 are found , allowing us to determine @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "each pair of vortices is only counted once . in figs .",

    "the nearest - neighbor search algorithm locates each nearest neighbour for each vortex within a radius specified by @xmath40 , as indicated by the large yellow circles in ( a ) and ( c ) . in an ordered lattice",
    ", such a circle should contain seven evenly spaced vortices , which is clearly not the case for the disordered distribution in ( c ) . in the second method",
    ", a triangular lattice is fitted to the vortex distribution .",
    "the fitted lattices in ( b ) and ( d ) are indicated by the yellow crosses.,width=302 ]        the second approach to determining how much disorder is present in a vortex distribution is to fit a triangular lattice to the distribution .",
    "the fitting parameters are the lattice spacing @xmath41 , orientation @xmath42 , and the vertical and horizontal position offsets from the cloud center .",
    "we make initial guesses of @xmath42 and the position offsets by analyzing the vortex distribution near the center of the cloud .",
    "the initial guess for @xmath41 is set to @xmath43 , since this provides a better initial guess than using only the vortices near the cloud center .",
    "this can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : measuringdisorder](c ) , where it is obvious that the inter - vortex separation near the cloud center is larger than that of the surrounding vortices .",
    "we fit a lattice with the same number of lattice sites as vortices using a least - squares fit .",
    "examples of fitted lattices can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : measuringdisorder](b ) and [ fig : measuringdisorder](d ) . using this approach , the disorder @xmath44 is defined in terms of the position deviation of vortices from their corresponding fitted lattice sites : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the number of vortices , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are coordinates of the fitted lattice sites and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the coordinates of the vortices .",
    "the equation amounts to the root - mean - square average of the position deviation normalized by the lattice spacing and is effectively the cost function of the fit . similarly to the geometric disorder , a perfectly ordered triangular lattice would have @xmath51 .     and @xmath52 , respectively , as a function of the width of the gaussian noise distribution .",
    "the solid lines are mean values of 50 theoretical vortex distributions for each value of noise amplitude and the shaded regions in each plot represent the standard deviation .",

[",
    "fig : unithexdisordertheory](a ) and ( b ) , the disorder grows linearly with noise amplitude in the low noise case , but aspects of each method cause deviations from this trend . for example , when calculating geometric disorder , if a given vortex is sufficiently far away from its nearest neighbors , it will no longer fall within @xmath40 , lowering the value of @xmath52 .",
    "this can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : unithexdisordertheory](b ) , where @xmath52 deviates from the linear relationship with the width of the gaussian noise distribution . due to the relatively small number of vortices present , such an out of place vortex has a large influence on @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath44 can be sensitive to the initial guess parameters for the least squares fitting routine , which can also converge to a local minimum instead of the global minimum , producing higher values of @xmath44 , particularly in the case of more disordered vortex distributions .    to determine how @xmath44 and @xmath52 are correlated , we plot one as a function of the other in fig .",
    "[ fig : unithexdisordertheory](c ) .",
    "the correlation between the two measures is good for the bulk of the points , but significant deviations occur for larger noise widths .",
    "an example of a vortex distribution that leads to such a disparity is shown in the figure , where some vortices are `` missed '' because they are not enclosed by @xmath40 , giving a lower than expected @xmath52 .",
    "this is not expected to be as much of a problem in systems where many more vortices are present .    despite the flaws of each individual method , the two complement one another .",
    "for instance , the geometric disorder value is not very sensitive to lattice dislocations , whereas a dislocation leads to high values of @xmath44 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : measuringdisorder](d ) , one can see that the vortices in the upper left of the cloud are ordered while the rest are not , leading to a moderate @xmath52 , but a high @xmath44 .",
    "selecting images with very different values of disorder for reanalysis could be used to automatically detect features such as grain boundaries in systems with many vortices .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : munnvsa ] , we plot @xmath35 against @xmath41 for all images with seven or more vortices .",
    "images with fewer vortices are not included because fewer than seven vortices are not expected to form an equilateral triangular lattice . in the initial time after stirring , many vortices are present in the system and are consequently relatively densely packed as well as being disordered .",
    "this is evident in the short length scale end of the plot .",
    "when the vortices are ordered in a perfect lattice , @xmath35 and @xmath41 should be equal .",

    "the number of vortices is only weakly correlated with atom number and is not correlated to condensate fraction , which rules out the effects of shot - to - shot repeatability of atom number and temperature in the experiment .",

    "the first is a long term instability in the ambient magnetic field , which can cause variations in both the quadrupole field zero position and the trapping frequency .",

    "the second potential cause is residual center - of - mass motion of the condensate coupling angular momentum back into the cloud , effectively causing a `` revival '' of the vortex lattice in some cases , such as the point with 12 vortices at 7.75  s. theoretical modelling is required for further investigation .        with higher rotational velocity of the condensate , the vortex density increases @xcite .",

    "figure  [ fig : disordervstime ] shows the evolution of order using each metric . using both measures ,",
    "a clear change in the mean values can be seen at 2  s. this agrees with the visual observation that the lattice crystallizes at around this time .",
    "we note that this coincides with the time when the maximum number of vortices is detected in the cloud .",
    "the stirring process leaves the condensate in a highly non - equilibrium state with numerous vortices entering the system at the edge of the condensate .",
    "not all of these vortices are detected due to the low density in this region . however ,",
    "after approximately 2  s , the dynamics between the condensate and thermal cloud have largely settled ; new vortices are no longer being added to the system and an ordered lattice can therefore form .",
