    "is the electroweak phase transition accompanied by the condensation of some defects ? what is happening with the defects at the crossover region",
    "? is there a range of parameters supporting a dilute gas of such defects in the broken phase and how are they related to the well - known sphaleron configurations ?",
    "these questions have been explored during the last year within the @xmath1 higgs model .",
    "the @xmath0-vortex string  @xcite corresponds to the abrikosov ",
    "olesen  @xcite vortex solution related to the abelian subgroup of @xmath1 embedded into the electroweak theory  @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-strings have been demonstrated to be unstable both at zero and at finite temperatures  @xcite .",
    "sphalerons  @xcite are unstable configurations as well , being transition states ( saddle points ) between vacua with different chern - simons number .",
    "classical sphalerons have been constructed on the lattice in refs .",
    "@xcite by a specific saddle point cooling technique ( these configurations have been important for our project ) .",
    "baryon asymmetry should not be washed out by sphaleron processes after the electroweak symmetry breaking has been completed .",
    "this requirement puts stringent conditions on the strength of the phase transition because the activation energy of these barriers strongly depends on the strength of the electroweak phase transition  @xcite .",
    "recently , lattice studies have shown ( see  @xcite for a conclusive summary ) that neither the simplified @xmath1 higgs model nor the @xmath2 model have a thermal transition of the necessary strength , given the experimental bounds on the higgs mass .",
    "this observation has triggered our interest to investigate whether , for higgs masses below the end of the phase transition  @xcite and in the crossover region above , topological excitations might be excited with a non - negligible statistical weight .",
    "these historical circumstances might explain why defects in the context of the electroweak phase transition are a rather new topic within lattice gauge theory .    in this contribution",
    "we briefly describe our lattice definitions and present selected results , some of them having not been published before .",
    "details can be found in refs .",
    "our study has been performed within the dimensionally reduced @xmath1 higgs theory which provides an effective representation of the electroweak theory in some range of higgs masses and at temperatures near to the electroweak scale .",
    "for the formulation of the lattice version of the effective theory see the talk of a. schiller at this conference  @xcite .",
    "the lattice gauge coupling @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 ) gives the lattice spacing in units of temperature , and the hopping parameter @xmath5 substitutes @xmath6 driving the transition .",
    "the parameter of the phase transition or the crossover can be translated into temperature @xmath7 and a higgs mass @xmath8 ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "notice that the higgs field is usually written as a multiple of a @xmath1 matrix @xmath9 , here we need it in the form of a @xmath10-component isospinor  @xmath11 .",
    "the gauge invariant and quantized lattice definition  @xcite of elementary @xmath0-vortices and nambu monopoles is closely related to the definition in the continuum theory  @xcite .",
    "first we define a composite adjoint unit vector field @xmath12 @xmath13 are pauli matrices . for the following purpose",
    ", @xmath14 plays a role similar to the adjoint higgs field in the definition of the t  hooft  polyakov monopole  @xcite within the georgi  glashow model .",
    "it helps to define the gauge invariant flux @xmath15 through the plaquette @xmath16 , @xmath17\\bigr ) \\label{ap}\\ ] ] via the projected links @xmath18 the auxiliary higgs field @xmath14 is covariantly constant with respect to these @xmath1-valued links .",
    "originally , nambu monopoles are topological defects of an abelian field which is defined in the unitary gauge ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) by the phases @xmath21 .",
    "this field behaves as a compact abelian field with respect to residual abelian gauge transformations which leave the unitary gauge condition intact .",
    "the gauge invariant flux would be extracted from its plaquettes @xmath22 as usual : @xmath23 .",
    "the magnetic charge of nambu monopole cubes and the @xmath0-vorticity number of plaquettes can alternatively be defined in a gauge invariant way  @xcite referring to ( [ ap ] ) .",
    "the monopole charge @xmath24 inside the cube @xmath25 is defined in terms of the gauge invariant fluxes ( [ ap ] ) penetrating the surface @xmath26 : @xmath27 the @xmath0vorticity number of the plaquette @xmath28 is defined  @xcite as follows : @xmath29 where @xmath15 has been given in ( [ ap ] ) , and @xmath30 is a plaquette variable written in terms of the abelian links @xmath31 .",
    "a @xmath0vortex is formed by links @xmath32 of the dual lattice which are dual to plaquettes @xmath16 which carry a non - zero vortex number ( [ sigman ] ) : @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath0vortex trajectories are either closed or begin / end on nambu ( anti- ) monopoles : @xmath34 this is how we actually localize nambu monopoles .",
    "when the embedded defects are physical excitations with some intrinsic size , one should be able to describe them on finer lattices as _ extended _ topological objects .",
    "an extended monopole ( vortex ) of physical size @xmath35 is defined on @xmath36 cubes ( @xmath37 plaquettes , respectively )  @xcite .",
    "the charge of monopoles @xmath38 on bigger @xmath36 cubes @xmath39 is constructed analogously to that of the elementary monopole ( [ jn ] ) with elementary @xmath40 plaquettes in terms of @xmath41 replaced by @xmath42 wilson loops ( extended plaquettes ) . in pure gauge theory , within the maximally abelian gauge , these objects are called type - i extended abelian monopoles we have numerically investigated the behavior of the type - i extended vortices of some _ fixed _ physical size on a series of finer and finer lattices towards the continuum limit .",
    "our results suggest that the continuum limit for type - i extended vortices may exist .",
    "we remark that an alternative , type - ii , construction  @xcite of extended objects fails to show a physically sensible behavior towards continuum limits .",
    "we have scanned the phase transition with elementary defects at @xmath43 gev ( strong first order ) and 70 gev ( weak first order ) for @xmath44 on a relatively small lattice @xmath45 . at the lower higgs mass we observed a discontinuity of the densities @xmath46 of nambu monopoles and @xmath47 of vortices .",
    "simultaneously we have measured the percolation probability @xmath48 derived from the cluster correlation function  @xcite @xmath49 where only those connected clusters @xmath50 of vortex lines ( @xmath51 labels distinct vortex clusters ) contribute to the nominator which pass through the points @xmath52 and @xmath53 . connected clusters @xmath50",
    "are called percolating clusters if they contribute to the limit @xmath54 .",
    "the percolation probability has a finite jump to zero at the pseudocritical @xmath55 for @xmath43 gev .",
    "the same study at @xmath56 gev , already near to the endpoint of the first order transition , is summarized in figure  1 and shows the percolation probability continuously vanishing towards @xmath57 .",
    "this is an inflection point of the densities @xmath58 and @xmath59 where they are approximately equal to half of their values in the symmetric phase .",
    "for @xmath60 the densities decrease exponentially .    for the case",
    "@xmath43 gev ( where we find zero densities of elementary defects on the broken side ) we have made some tests whether the densities of extended defects on the symmetric side admit a continuum limit .",
    "we have chosen elementary vortices and monopoles on a lattice simulated at @xmath61 and compared them with extended defects of size @xmath62 for simulations at @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "a lattice size @xmath45 corresponding to a shrinking volume has been taken for all three cases because we did not expect severe finite size effects at such a strong transition .",
    "this ( preliminary ) test is shown in figure  2 in the form of histograms of average vortex and monopole densities per configuration .",
    "the measurements have been performed near to the respective @xmath65 for the three values of @xmath66 and gave always a two - state signal with a density distribution peaking at or near to zero on the symmetric side .",
    "there is no way to perform an additive renormalization of the density at the broken side by taking differences between the phases ( in analogy to the higgs modulus squared @xmath67 , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . with a box size @xmath68 ( @xmath69 )",
    "we seem to be at the upper edge of the size distribution of physical vortices . with increasing @xmath66 , our construction for extended defects seems to describe the vorticity better .",
    "this might explain the monotonous increase to some ( still unknown ) _ continuum _ density of vortices / monopoles .",
    "physically the crossover region is more interesting since we can study the properties of isolated defects in a not - so - dilute environment .",
    "we show in figure  3 the behavior of densities and percolation probability @xmath54 _ vs. _",
    "@xmath5 for @xmath70 gev at @xmath44 for elementary defects .",
    "we were wondering whether there is an universal percolation temperature for vortices of extendedness @xmath35 at respective @xmath71 . in order to prevent bigger finite size effects",
    ", now we kept the physical volume constant using @xmath72 lattices .",
    "the percolation probability @xmath54 and the densities are shown in figure  4 _ vs. _ @xmath5 as measured for @xmath73 on a @xmath74 lattice . from all critical @xmath75 values",
    "we estimate @xmath76 or 130 gev ( without or with @xmath77-quarks ) .",
    "this corresponds to a higgs mass @xmath78 or 103 gev ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xmath70 gev ) .",
    "the cluster structure of the configurations changes drastically at this temperature .",
    "we illustrate this for @xmath73 vortices in figure  5 with the average number of clusters and the average length per cluster _ vs. _ @xmath5 .",
    "our results obtained in an effective @xmath79 equilibrium approach suggest a scenario with a ( few ) percolating clusters decaying into smaller ones , vortex rings and monopoliums , a process to be described by a kinetic approach to the crossover .",
    "note that the average length per cluster has a long tail at a level of two .",
    "we propose to interpret the half density @xmath80 as the density of spalerons on the broken side of the crossover .",
    "we support this conjecture by what we have found  @xcite to be the signature of a _ classical _ lattice sphaleron with respect to the new ( @xmath0-vortex and nambu monopole ) degrees of freedom .",
    "figure  6 shows one of the solutions of ref .",
    "@xcite with a nambu monopole - antimonopole pair in the center , compared with a view in the maximally abelian gauge .",
    "c +   +    one might argue that the defects counted by the lattice operators ( [ jn ] ) and ( [ sigman ] ) might be mere artifacts having nothing in common with the vortex solutions in the continuum .",
    "figure  7 shows that this is not the case . here",
    "the average gauge field action per plaquette and the higgs field modulus squared averaged over the corners of a plaquette is shown as function of @xmath5 , separately for plaquettes with @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the data refer to @xmath83 gev and @xmath84 .",
    "one can clearly see that the modulus of the higgs field is smaller near to the vortex trajectory than outside the vortex for all values of the coupling @xmath5 . moreover , the value of the gauge field energy near to the vortex center is larger than in the bulk ( the increasing error of the gauge field action inside the vortex at the largest @xmath5 reflects the small number of plaquettes with non - vanishing vorticity ) .",
    "these results show that @xmath0vortices are physical objects which resemble the characteristic features of the classical vortex solutions in continuum : the vortices carry the excess of the gauge field energy and the higgs modulus decreases near to the vortex center .",
    "in future we have to complete these studies by a more systematic exploration of the continuum behavior / size distribution of defects .",
    "furthermore we plan to extend our considerations to more realistic models with non - zero weinberg angle .",
    "last but not least , euclidean simulations seem to be necessary to clarify the connection of the dynamics of vortices with the evolution of the chern - simons number .",
    "this may shed some light on the baryogenesis scenario @xcite based on the dynamical properties of the @xmath0vortex string network .",
