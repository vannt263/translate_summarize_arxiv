    "the regularity and singularity of mean curvature flow , which is a one - parameter family of hypersurfaces in @xmath0 moving by its mean curvature , have been studied by many authors .",
    "there is an excellent survey paper @xcite on this issue from classical results to recent developments .",
    "in particular it is well - studied for mean - convex flows , namely mean curvature flows of hypersurfaces with positive mean curvature .",
    "a well - known conjecture about such flows is : any mean - convex flow from a smooth initial surface develops singularities only at finitely many epochs ( for example see @xcite ) .",
    "the main result of this paper , theorem [ maintheorem ] , shows that there is a chance that the set of singular epochs is not finite even if an initial surface has only one singular point .",
    "such an example is rigorously given in the section 3 but rough shape of the initial surface is as drawn in figure [ figgamma0 ] .",
    "our initial surface is constructed by dilation .",
    "thus it is self - similar near the singularity . using the self - similarity",
    ", we prove that the flow from the surface pinches at infinitely many epochs ( times ) @xmath1 by comparing angenent s doughnuts @xcite and balls .",
    "one may be tempted to construct such a surface by using a rescaled periodic function . however , this simple idea does not work directly , although idea of rescaling is important .",
    "our construction looks slightly complicated because we have to connect a ball like shape in a suitable way .",
    "an advantage of our construction is that it is easy to confirm the desired properties like mean - convexity .",
    "the feature of our construction is explained in detail in remark [ remperiod ] .",
    "we describe the result in terms of the level set method introduced by chen - giga - goto @xcite and evans - spruck @xcite ( see a self - contained book by giga @xcite for details ) .",
    "this method can define a _ ( generalized ) interface evolution _ of mean curvature flow for all times through singularities . the interface evolution is uniquely determined by a given initial surface , although in general it is not necessary unique in the sense of `` surface evolution '' .",
    "the reason is that interface evolutions can fatten , namely , have an interior point at some time .",
    "however , our example is now mean - convex in the sense of white @xcite hence it does not fatten .    in the rest of this section , we mention some related known results .",
    "our example is useful to contrast known results .    for any smooth compact initial surface",
    ", there is a unique classical solution of mean curvature flow at least locally in time ( see e.g.  @xcite@xcite )",
    ". however it must develop singularities in finite time and it is complicated generally .",
    "the first non simple singularity is given by grayson @xcite called `` neck - pinching '' , which inspires the result of this paper .    on the other hand ,",
    "mean curvature flow has a smoothing effect due to its parabolicity .",
    "a remarkable well - known result by ecker and huisken @xcite is that any uniform lipschitz initial surface admits a classical solution of mean curvature flow locally in time .",
    "this result is proved by establishing local interior regularity estimates .",
    "some other results are also known .",
    "for example , evans and spruck @xcite proved a local interior regularity result for a level set flow provided that it is given locally as the graph of a continuous function .",
    "in addition , the recent works of tonegawa and his co - authors @xcite@xcite@xcite show the local existence of a classical solution for @xmath2 initial surfaces in terms of the brakke flow ( with a transport term ) .",
    "our example suggests that these smoothing effects are crucially based on that an initial surface is locally represented by a graph .",
    "as mentioned above , mean - convex flows are well - studied compared with general flows .",
    "there are many results about the size or nature of the singular set of mean - convex flows ( see e.g.  @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite or the subsection 2.3 in @xcite for details ) .",
    "in particular , if @xmath3 , the mean - convex interface evolution is smooth for almost every time @xcite .",
    "our example shows that the set of singular times can be an infinite set ( in a finite time interval ) .",
    "the case that an initial surface is given by rotating a graph is studied even better in @xcite . in particular",
    ", an axisymmetric compact smooth initial surface develops singularities only at finitely many epochs .",
    "our example is axisymmetric thus also complements the above result .",
    "finally , we mention the case of curve shortening flow ( @xmath4 ) . in this case , recently , lauer proved that any finite length jordan curve is smoothed out instantly @xcite .",
    "this result is in marked contrast to our higher dimensional result ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "in fact , our example is of finite area and the image of a continuous injection from the @xmath6-dimensional sphere , although the result as @xcite is not valid .",
    "in this section we state our main theorem rigorously . throughout this paper , for a given open set @xmath7 ( resp .",

    "if we drop connectivity , an example of initial surface developing infinitely many singular epochs is easily provided by taking a countable union of dwindling spheres converging to a point .",
    "the monotonicity in ( 2 ) is the same to the mean - convexity of white @xcite .",
    "this monotonicity directly implies that the interface evolution does not fatten so that the level set flow is nothing but a brakke flow ( see also @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "we construct an example concretely in order to prove theorem [ maintheorem ] .",
    "this construction is based on the comparison principle of mean curvature flow ( lemma [ disjoint ] ) and two self - shrinking classical solutions ( example [ sphere ] and [ doughnut ] ) . using them",
