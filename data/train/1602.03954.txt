    "each user achieves 1/2 degrees of freedom ( dof ) by the ia approach . in this scheme ,",
    "global channel state information at transmitter ( csit ) is necessary to align interfering signals at unintended receivers .",
    "however , global csit is hard to achieve or even can not be achieved in pracical systems .",
    "even when global csit is available , transmitters may obtain imperfect channel knowledge due to quantization error and feedback delay .    in the absence of csit",
    ", interference - limited networks can not achieve the sum dof more than 1 for a general channel state condition @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , it was introduced that the ia technique increases the sum dof without csit for a specific channel s coherence time / bandwidth condition @xcite-@xcite .",
    "with such a channel condition , a total of @xmath6 dof is achievable for @xmath0-user ic , which meets the outer bound of the perfect csit scenario .",
    "this ia technique is referred to as _ blind interference alignment ( bia)_. to make the specific channel condition more feasible , bia through reconfigurable antenna switching was proposed @xcite .",
    "the dof characterization with reconfigurable antennas has been studied for various network scenarios with the assumption that the number of preset modes at a receiver ( @xmath7 ) is not greater than the number of transmit antennas ( @xmath8 ) , i.e. , @xmath9 @xcite-@xcite . according to @xcite , @xmath0-user @xmath1 multiple - input single - output ( miso ) broadcast channels ( bc )",

    "meanwhile , for the ic scenario , a new achievable scheme for the @xmath0-user miso ic is proposed in @xcite-@xcite for the asymmetric antenna configuration , with the condition that @xmath14 , where transmitter @xmath12 ( receiver @xmath12 ) has @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) antennas ( preset modes ) , respectively . when transmitters are equipped with different number of transmit antennas , the number of transmit symbols is dependent on the number of transmit antennas . if @xmath17 for all @xmath12 , the @xmath0-user @xmath1 miso ic also achieves a total of @xmath10 dof as the @xmath0-user @xmath1 miso bc .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is to fully characterize the dof for the @xmath0-user @xmath1 miso ic with reconfigurable antennas at the receivers by considering only linear coding strategies without channel knowledge at transmitters , which includes the case where the number of preset modes is greater than the number of transmit antennas , i.e. @xmath18 .",
    "this is the most general result in the literature .",
    "it was recently reported that a total of @xmath19 dof is achievable for the 3-user single - input single - output ( siso ) ic with @xmath20 preset modes @xcite .",
    "this result shows that extra preset modes at the receivers in comparison with the number of transmit antennas can be exploited to increase the sum dof for the ic scenario , while extra preset modes can not have a beneficial effect on the sum dof for the bc scenario @xcite .",
    "subsequently , it was simply extended in @xcite that the @xmath0-user siso ic with 2 receiver preset modes achieves a total of @xmath21 dof . in this paper",
    ", we derive a new linear sum dof upper - bound for the @xmath0-user @xmath1 miso ic with @xmath7 preset modes , including the @xmath18 scenario .    in our approach",
    "to derive the linear sum dof upper - bound , we focus on a lemma which claims that if a set of transmit symbols is aligned at their common unintended receivers , those symbols must have independent signal subspace at their intended receivers , which is induced from the characteristic of the channel matrix with reconfigurable antenna switching .",
    "specifically , we exploit the notable feature that channel states of the links towards the same receiver must have the same changing pattern since the changing pattern of the channel state is determined solely by the receiver s preset mode pattern , under the assumption that the coherence time of the channel is long enough .",
    "remarkably , we show that the linear sum dof upper - bound is achievable when @xmath2 and @xmath3 are integers , where @xmath22 represents the optimal number of preset modes among @xmath7 preset modes at each receiver , under the linear scheme obtained by modifying the existing achievable scheme for the ic scenario in @xcite . if these conditions are not satisfied , i.e. , either @xmath4 or @xmath5 is not an integer , we give some guidelines for an achievable scheme , which shows how to align interfering signals by introducing the concept of an alignment set .",
    "we also extend our approach to downlink / uplink cellular networks .",
    "there has been previous work on the bia scheme with reconfigurable antennas for cellular networks : the cluster - based frequency reuse system @xcite-@xcite , data sharing for cell - edge users @xcite-@xcite , and the sum dof characterizations @xcite-@xcite . in this paper , we derive the linear sum dof upper - bound for fully connected downlink cellular networks with reconfigurable antennas at the users , by applying the same lemma for the ic scenario .",
    "we also show this upper - bound implies that extra preset modes at the users compared with base station s antennas can be useful to increase the linear sum dof without data sharing between base stations .",
    "in addition , our result is applied to uplink scenario with reconfigurable antennas at the base station by considering the effect of transmitter cooperation for the ic scenario with no csit .",

    "<S> in this paper , we characterize the degrees of freedom ( dof ) for @xmath0-user @xmath1 multiple - input single - output interference channels with reconfigurable antennas which have multiple preset modes at the receivers , assuming linear coding strategies in the absence of channel state information at the transmitters , i.e. , blind interference alignment . </S>",
    "<S> our linear dof converse builds on the lemma that if a set of transmit symbols is aligned at their common unintended receivers , those symbols must have independent signal subspace at their corresponding receivers . </S>",
    "<S> this lemma arises from the inherent feature that channel state s changing patterns of the links towards the same receiver are always identical , assuming that the coherence time of the channel is long enough . </S>",
    "<S> we derive an upper bound for the linear sum dof , and propose an achievable scheme that exactly achieves the linear sum dof upper - bound when both of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 are integers . for the other cases , where either @xmath4 or @xmath5 is not an integer , we only give some guidelines how the interfering signals are aligned at the receivers to achieve the upper - bound . as an extension , </S>",
    "<S> we also show the linear sum dof upper - bound for downlink / uplink cellular networks .    </S>",
