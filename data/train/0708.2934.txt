    "magic @xcite is currently the largest single dish imaging air cherenkov telescope ( iact ) in operation .",
    "located on the canary island la palma ( @xmath1n , @xmath2w , 2200  m a.s.l . )",
    ", it has a 17-m diameter tessellated parabolic mirror , supported by a light weight carbon fiber frame .",
    "it is equipped with a high quantum efficiency 576-pixel @xmath3 field - of - view photomultiplier camera .",
    "the analog signals are transported via optical fibers to the trigger electronics and the 2 gsamples / s fadc system @xcite .",
    "the magic telescope can operate under moderate moonlight or twilight conditions @xcite . for these conditions ,",
    "no change in the high voltage settings is necessary as the camera pmts were especially designed to avoid high currents .",
    "the physics program of the magic telescope includes both , topics of fundamental physics and astrophysics . in this paper",
    "the observations of galactic sources are reviewed .",
    "the observations of extragalactic sources are presented elsewhere , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the data analysis is generally carried out using the standard magic analysis and reconstruction software @xcite , the first step of which involves the fadc signal reconstruction and the calibration of the raw data @xcite .",
    "after calibration , image - cleaning tail cuts are applied ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the camera images are parameterized by image parameters @xcite . the random forest method",
    "( see @xcite for a detailed description ) was applied for the @xmath0/hadron separation ( for a review see e.g. @xcite ) and the energy estimation .    for each event ,",
    "the arrival direction of the primary @xmath0-ray candidate in sky coordinates is estimated using the disp - method resulting in vhe @xmath0-ray sky maps @xcite .",
    "the angular resolution of this procedure is @xmath4 , while the source localization in the sky is provided with a systematic error of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the differential vhe @xmath0-ray spectrum ( @xmath6 vs. true @xmath7 ) is corrected ( unfolded ) for the instrumental energy resolution @xcite .",
    "all fits to the spectral points take into account the correlations between the spectral points that are introduced by the unfolding procedure .",
    "the systematic error in the flux level determination depends on the slope of the @xmath0-ray spectrum .",
    "it is typically estimated to be 35% and the systematic error in the the spectral index is 0.2 @xcite .",
    "the observations with the magic telescope included the following types of objects : vhe @xmath0-ray sources coincident with supernova remnants ( section [ sec : snr ] ) , the galactic center ( section [ sec : gc ] ) , the @xmath0-ray binary ls  i  + 61  303 ( section [ sec : lsi ] ) , pulsars and pulsar wind nebulae ( section [ sec : crab ] ) .",
    "shocks produced by supernova explosions are assumed to be the source of the galactic component of the cosmic ray flux  @xcite . in inelastic collisions of high energy cosmic rays with ambient matter @xmath0-rays and neutrinos",
    "are produced .",
    "these neutral particles give direct information about their source , as their trajectories are not affected by the galactic and extra galactic magnetic fields in contrast to the charged cosmic rays .",
    "however , not all vhe @xmath0-rays from galactic sources are due to the interactions of cosmic rays with ambient matter .",
    "there are also other mechanisms for the production of vhe @xmath0-rays like the inverse compton up - scattering of ambient low energy photons by vhe electrons . for each individual source of vhe @xmath0-rays ,",
    "the physical processes of particle acceleration and @xmath0-ray emission in this source have to be determined .",
    "a powerful tool is the modeling of the multiwavelength emission of the source taking into account the ambient gas density as traced by co observations @xcite . within its program of observation of galactic sources ,",
    "magic has taken data on a number of supernova remnants , resulting in the discovery of vhe @xmath0-ray emission from a source in the snr ic443 , magic j0616 + 225 @xcite . moreover",
    ", two recently discovered vhe @xmath0-ray sources , which are spatially coincident with snrs , hess  j1813 - 178 and hess  j1834 - 087 @xcite have been observed with the magic telescope @xcite .",
    "* ic443 * is a well - studied shell - type snr near the galactic plane with a diameter of 45 at a distance of about 1.5  kpc .",

    "@xcite extrapolated the energy spectrum of 3eg  j0617 + 2238 into the vhe @xmath0-ray range and predicted readily observable fluxes .",
    "nevertheless , previous generation iacts have only reported upper limits to the vhe @xmath0-ray emission @xcite .",
    "the observation of ic  443 using the magic telescope has led to the discovery of a new source of vhe @xmath0-rays , magic  j0616 + 225 .",
    "the flux level of magic  j0616 + 225 is lower and the energy spectrum ( fitted with a power law of slope @xmath8 ) is softer than the predictions .",
    "the coincidence of the vhe @xmath0-ray source with snr ic  443 suggests this snr as a natural counterpart . a massive molecular cloud and oh maser emissions",
    "are located at the same sky position as that of magic  j0616 + 225 , see figure [ fig : sky_ic443 ] .",
    "this suggests that a hadronic origin of the vhe @xmath0-rays is possible .",

    "the galactic center was observed with the magic telescope  @xcite under large zenith angles , resulting in the measurement of a differential @xmath0-ray flux , consistent with a steady , hard - slope power law between 500  gev and about 20  tev , with a spectral index of @xmath21 .",
