    "the non - gaussianity in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) has been one of the hottest topics in cosmology because it could open a new window for probing the primordial universe .",
    "recent cmb observations , especially wmap  @xcite and planck  @xcite , have confirmed to a very high accuracy that the primordial curvature perturbations have a nearly scale invariant initial power spectrum and the associated statistics is nearly gaussian .",
    "these observations are consistent with the predictions of an early inflationary era driven by a single slow - rolling scalar field .    the possibility of non - gaussianity in the primordial curvature perturbations was discussed for the first time quantitatively by komatsu and spergel  @xcite .",
    "they parameterized the level of non - gaussianity in the potential @xmath0 ( the curvature potential in the newton or poisson gauge ) by @xmath1 \\,.\\ ] ] here , @xmath2 denotes the gaussian part of the perturbation , or in perturbation theory its linear part , and @xmath3 designates the statistical average .",
    "this type of non - gaussianity leads to a non - vanishing three point correlation function , or equivalently in reciprocal space to a non - vanishing bispectrum .",
    "the prediction for the possible values of this parameter @xmath4 from a phase of single - field slow - roll inflation was first performed by maldacena  @xcite , and it was shown that it is of order of the slow - roll parameters and thus highly suppressed . hence , if a @xmath4 of order unity or greater is detected , this simplest model of inflation will be ruled out .",
    "unfortunately , the interpretation of the measured non - gaussianity is not so straightforward because we do not observe directly the primordial non - gaussianity in the curvature perturbation but its effect on the cmb fluctuations .",
    "therefore , to relate the primordial curvature perturbation to cmb , we first have to compute the evolution of perturbations after inflation .",
    "these effects can be split unambiguously in two parts : i ) a linear transfer that can not create a non - gaussian signal if the initial conditions are purely gaussian , and ii ) a non - linear transfer that generates a non - gaussian signal in the observables even if the initial conditions are purely gaussian .",
    "the resulting non - gaussian signal from i ) is often called _ primordial non - gaussianity _ and all the possible sources of non - linear evolutions which enter the category ii ) are called _ secondary non - gaussianity_. recently the planck collaboration provided a constraint @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this result was obtained by subtracting one of the secondary non - gaussianities that arises from the correlation between the lensing and integrated sachs - wolfe effect .",
    "this clearly demonstrates the importance of subtracting all the secondary non - gaussianity consistently in order to obtain an accurate constraint on the primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "the evolution of the perturbations on super - horizon scales is well understood , even fully non - linearly using either a covariant approach  @xcite , or a separate universe approach with the so - called @xmath6 formalism  @xcite , since it leads to a conservation law for the curvature perturbations in the case of adiabatic perturbations . on the other hand ,",
    "the evolution for modes below the horizon scale is not so simple analytically , especially at the non - linear order , and the use of a kinetic description can not be avoided on small scales since radiation starts to develop an anisotropic stress . in order to obtain numerical results for the non - linear evolution , we need to derive and solve without approximations the coupled system of non - linear a ) einstein equation for the metric , b ) conservation and euler equations for fluids and c ) boltzmann equation for radiation ( photons and neutrinos ) .",
    "note that the conservation and euler equations can always be deduced from the lowest moments of the boltzmann equation , and the full set of equations is often only referred to as _ einstein - boltzmann system _ of equations .    in order to follow this roadmap ,",
    "the second order boltzmann equation was written down in the poisson gauge in refs .",
    "the gauge dependence of the distribution function was obtained at linear order  @xcite and then at second order  @xcite but leaving aside the problem of polarisation .",
    "it was then extended to include polarised light in ref .",
    "the system of equations was then solved numerically in fourier space in poisson gauge in  @xcite , and it was reported that the secondary effects around the last - scattering surface could mimic a primordial signal of @xmath7 .",
    "recently there have been a huge progress in improving the numerical calculations and clarifying the amplitude of various secondary non - gaussianities at recombination  @xcite , and a consensus emerged that when including all the non - linear effects around recombination _ and _ the integrated early effects after recombination , it could mimic a primordial signal of @xmath8 , as expected from analytic approximations  @xcite .",
    "the description of the spectral dependence of the distribution function is also crucial at second order .",
    "indeed , at first order there are no spectral distortions and the perturbation of the photon distribution function can be understood as a single , spectrum - independent temperature fluctuation",
    ". however , at second order , there appears a deviation from the planck distribution , resulting in a continuum of spectral distortions , which in principle must superimpose the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich effect  @xcite . to describe this distortion",
    ", we use a direction and position dependent compton @xmath9 parameter  @xcite , and also introduce a similar tensor - valued variable to describe the distortion in the polarisation , thus extending the formalism introduced in ref .  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we derive the second order boltzmann equation without restricting to a specific gauge , and including polarisation . reflecting on the above ,",
    "our motivation is two - fold .",
    "first , since the structure of the second order einstein and boltzmann equations depends very much on a choice of the gauge , we have to find a gauge in which we can numerically solve this system accurately and quickly .",
    "therefore , it is preferable not to specify the gauge from the beginning but to formulate the equations without specifying it .",
    "we can impose different gauge restrictions in their final form to explore the stability and efficiency of the numerical integration .",
    "second , we would like to check the equations derived in refs .",
    "@xcite . as a direct check ,",
    "we recover them in the specific case of the poisson gauge .",
    "then , as an indirect check , we revisit the transformation properties of the distribution function and the metric perturbations and confirm that the perturbed boltzmann equation is gauge - invariant up to second order in perturbations , thus increasing our confidence in the rather lengthy derivation .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was found that the inclusion or omission of certain line of sight terms can make a large impact on the estimation of the bias to the primordial non - gaussianity due to the secondary non - gaussianity . in refs",
    "@xcite all physical effects were included except for lensing and time - delay .",
    "these time - integrated effects require a separate analysis because at later times small - scale multipoles get excited and numerically it is very difficult to evolve the equations . in this paper",
    ", we point out that the separation of these effects depends on a gauge .",
    "given that the lensing - isw cross correlation gives the largest bias to the primordial local type non - gaussianity , one should bear this gauge dependence in mind when separating these time integrated effects in the calculations .",
    "the choice of the gauge and the associated choice of the tetrad field for the distribution function is also crucial in the interpretation of the quantities as observables .",
    "these subtle details do not affect our interpretation of observables in the linear theory since it is only relevant for the monopole and the dipole .",
    "however it is no longer the case at second order in perturbations .",
    "we must understand the transformation properties of the distribution function under a gauge transformation or a change of the inertial frame and determine what is a gauge and a choice of inertial frame that is related to cmb experiments .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : def ] , we give the definitions of the variables that we use for the metric , momentum and distribution function . especially , to express the perturbation of the metric , we use a geometrical @xmath10 decomposition , or the adm  @xcite parametrisation of the metric . at first order",
    ", there is no particular advantage in using this formalism , but various expressions are simplified at second order for the choice of the inertial frame that we make . in section  [ sec : boltz ] , we derive the second order boltzmann equation with polarisation without restricting to a specific gauge . in section  [ sec : gauge ] , we discuss the gauge dependence of the variables .",
    "we carefully investigate the gauge transformation of the metric , momentum and the distribution function .",
    "we then check explicitly the gauge invariance of the perturbed boltzmann equation up to second order as a consistency test .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conc ] , we summarize our results and we comment briefly on the relevance of our formalism for the observed cmb anisotropy .",
    "useful technical details are gathered in the appendices .",
    "in this section we build all the tools which are used for the description of polarized radiation in cosmology .",
    "we first review briefly the parametrization of cosmological perturbations , and explain how a photon momentum can be uniquely described by its energy and direction once a suitable tetrad choice has been made .",
    "we then introduce the tensor - valued distribution function which is used to treat statistically a gas of polarized photons , and which is the key object in the boltzmann equation , and we finally present how it can be decomposed into its main spectral components .",

    "any perturbation @xmath26 will be expanded into its first and second order parts as @xmath27 the relations between the adm variables and the usual definitions of cosmological perturbations are provided in appendix  [ app : adm ] .",
    "the boltzmann equation is better formulated by explicitly using a local inertial frame at every point of the space - time and this can be achieved by using a tetrad field .",
    "it is a set of four vector fields which satisfy @xmath28 these conditions determine the choice of tetrad only up to rotations and boosts . here",

    "its expression in tetrad components reduces necessarily to the identity of the two - dimensional subspace which is left invariant by the projector , that is @xmath57      in order to describe the polarisation of radiation , we introduce a tensor - valued distribution function @xmath58 , which is complex valued and hermitian .",

    "this completes the consistency test of the boltzmann equation that we have derived as well as all the gauge transformation rules obtained for its constituents .",
    "the same property is found of course for the circular polarisation since in that case the collision term vanishes . as for polarisation",
    ", we have also checked that the liouville operator @xmath295 and the collision term @xmath296 transform like tensor valued quantities ( see the details in appendix  [ appgtlc ] ) .",
    "more importantly , we have checked that the liouville and collision terms for the spectral distortions ( @xmath297 and @xmath298 ) are gauge invariant as it should be since they vanish on the background and first - order spacetimes .",
    "the gauge invariance of the boltzmann equation , as in the case of einstein equation and in general for covariant equations , enables us to write it down in terms of gauge invariant variables . in practice , it is equivalent to completely fix the gauge and write down the equations in term of the perturbation in this gauge .",
    "in this paper we derived the second order boltzmann equation in the most general manner incorporating polarisation and without fixing a gauge . in order to describe the polarisation of photon",
    ", we used a formalism based on a tensor - valued distribution function .",
    "we performed the separation between temperature and spectral distortion for the intensity and we also extended this separation to polarisation .",
    "we then derived the gauge transformation rules for the metric , the momentum and the distribution function to see how those quantities are mixed under the gauge transformation .",
    "as an application , we checked the gauge dependence of the derived boltzmann equation under a gauge transformation and obtained consistent transformation rules .",
    "this is a non - trivial check of the correctness of the derived equations as well as the gauge transformation rules .",
    "we now discuss two issues related to the gauge dependence in the boltzmann equation .",
    "it is well known that the lensing term @xmath299 which is written in terms of the conventional lensing potential in the newtonian gauge significantly affects the bispectrum of cmb  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the correlation between the lensing and isw effect is the dominant contribution to the bias for the local - type non - gaussianity in planck .",
    "however it is very hard to include this contribution in the line of sight integration and evaluate it until today .",
    "usually , the lensing effect is added separately to the final result obtained in the poisson gauge .",
    "however the effect from this lensing term depends on the gauge choice .",
    "actually , as we have seen above , the lensing term is mixed with other terms under the gauge transformation .",
    "this means that some of lensing effects in a specific gauge are absorbed into other effects in another gauge . in principle , there exists a gauge where we can avoid the difficult computation of this lensing term to some extent by evaluating other more tractable terms . since we have derived the boltzmann equation without choosing any specific gauge , it should be possible to investigate this possibility further .      here",
    "we make a comment on the observed temperature anisotropies . in the main part of this paper",
    ", we have shown that the second order boltzmann equation is gauge invariant and thus it can be written in terms of gauge invariant quantities",
    ". however , there is a subtlety in the meaning of `` gauge invariance '' .",
    "this originates from our choice of the local inertial frame .    as is clear from eq  ( [ tetrads ] )",
    ", we always choose the local inertial frame so that the three - velocity vanishes , @xmath300 and there is no rotation of the spatial axis relative to the background spatial coordinate axis , let us call @xmath301 . in order to achieve this",
    ", the local inertial frame has to be changed when we perform a gauge transformation . if we were to identify this local inertial frame as the one of an observer , we would be lead to consider different observers in different gauges .",
    "this is clear from the gauge transformation at the first order : @xmath302 the last term comes from a change of local inertial frame . by fixing the gauge",
    "we can promote @xmath86 to the gauge invariant temperature fluctuations but these are temperature fluctuations observed by an observer with @xmath300 and @xmath301 in this gauge . in order to evaluate temperature fluctuations observed by a different observer",
    ", we need to change the local inertial frame .",
    "alternatively , we can perform a gauge transformation keeping the conditions @xmath300 and @xmath301 for the local inertial frame so that this frame coincides with the one of the observer .    in all the literature",
    ", the second order temperature anisotropies are calculated in the poisson gauge so far , with a specific choice of the local inertial frame . strictly speaking this is not the temperature anisotropies that we observe as there is no reason for us to be comoving with the local inertial frame associated with such a gauge .",
    "one thus needs to change the local inertial frame or change a gauge . at first order ,",
    "this was not an issue .",
    "as is clear from  ( [ 1sttempg ] ) , the change of gauge and the local inertial frame only affect the monopole @xmath303 and dipole @xmath304 if we expand the temperature anisotropies into multipole components .",
    "thus , the @xmath305 modes are not affected by the change of observers .",
    "however this is no longer the case at the second order . in the second order gauge transformation ,",
    "there are terms that are convolutions of the first order temperature anisotropies and the gauge transformation ; @xmath306 these terms affect the observed temperatures even for the @xmath305 modes .    in order to define the \" observed temperature anisotropies  , we should keep the conditions @xmath300 and @xmath301 for the local inertial frame and specify the gauge so that this local inertial frame coincides with our local inertial frame where we perform experiments",
    ". thus special care must be taken when we compare theoretical predictions to observations .",

    "<S> in the context of cosmological perturbation theory , we derive the second order boltzmann equation describing the evolution of the distribution function of radiation without a specific gauge choice . </S>",
    "<S> the essential steps in deriving the boltzmann equation are revisited and extended given this more general framework : i ) the polarisation of light is incorporated in this formalism by using a tensor - valued distribution function ; ii ) the importance of a choice of the tetrad field to define the local inertial frame in the description of the distribution function is emphasized ; iii ) we perform a separation between temperature and spectral distortion , both for the intensity and for polarisation for the first time ; iv ) the gauge dependence of all perturbed quantities that enter the boltzmann equation is derived , and this enables us to check the correctness of the perturbed boltzmann equation by explicitly showing its gauge - invariance for both intensity and polarization . </S>",
    "<S> we finally discuss several implications of the gauge dependence for the observed temperature . </S>"
