    "one of the big surprises of the rhic experimental program has been the large elliptic flow @xcite , which , contrary to sps energies , agreed more or less with predictions from ideal hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "this surprising agreement let to the conjecture that the matter at rhic is a strongly coupled , nearly perfect fluid , with very small shear viscosity . indeed using the ads - cft correspondence , is was shown that a large class of strongly coupled theories seem to have a universal minimal shear viscosity of @xmath2 @xcite . meanwhile",
    ", more refined calculations based on relativistic viscous hydrodynamic @xcite seem to indicate that a finite but small value for the shear viscosity is required in order to reproduce the @xmath3 dependence of the measured transverse flow . on the theoretical side",
    "very little is known about the shear viscosity of high temperature qcd .",
    "perturbative calculations lead to a considerably larger value than the conjectured lower bound . extracting a value for the shear viscosity from lattice qcd ( lqcd ) ,",
    "on the other hand , requires analytic continuation to real time , thus leading to substantial uncertainties @xcite .",
    "it was also found that the elliptic flow of the observed hadrons scales with the number of quarks @xcite as predicted by a quark coalescence picture of hadronization @xcite .",
    "this in turn implies that the scaled @xmath4 may be interpreted as that of the quarks prior to hadronization , and we will use this interpretation in the following where we always refer to the elliptic anisotropy of quarks .    in this contribution",
    "we want to entertain an entirely different view and interpretation of the observed elliptic flow .",
    "first , we note that lattice qcd results @xcite suggest a quasi - particle picture , at least for the quarks .",
    "both flavor - off - diagonal susceptibilities @xcite and higher order baryon number susceptibilities @xcite are consistent with vanishing correlations for temperatures right above the transition , @xmath5 . estimating the strength of correlations in the gluon sector is not so straightforward , due to the lack of any additional quantum numbers , such as flavor , which one can use to study correlations .",
    "therefore , let us conjecture , that gluons behave like quasi - particles as well .",
    "in this case we have a single - particle description of the qgp right above @xmath0 .",
    "next we need to address the equation of state above @xmath0 , where lqcd finds the pressure to be considerably @xmath6 below that of a free gas of massless quarks and gluons .",
    "since lqcd calculations are carried out in the grand - canonical ensemble , i.e. at fixed chemical potential rather than particle number , a reduction of the pressure in a single - particle picture implies a _ repulsive _ , density dependent single - particle potential , i.e ,",
    "@xmath7<\\int d^{3}p\\,\\exp\\left[-\\frac{e_{0}}{t}\\right]\\sim p_{0}\\ ] ] for @xmath8",
    ". here @xmath9 denotes the pressure of a free , non - interacting gas of partons .",
    "the presence of a _ repulsive _ single - particle potential has interesting consequences , especially for the elliptic anisotropy , @xmath10 given the almond shaped initial distribution of matter in the transverse plane in a semi - central heavy - ion collision , the ( negative ) gradient of the potential , and thus the force , is larger in the in - plane than in the out - of - plane direction . as a consequence",
    "the momentum kick due to the repulsive single - particle potential is larger in plane than out of plane , resulting in a deformation of the momentum distribution in qualitative agreement with the observed elliptic anisotropy , @xmath11 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we note that this effect does _ not _ require a short mean free path or , equivalently , a small viscosity .    besides the positive @xmath4 the single - particle dynamics leads to two additional , qualitative predictions .",
    "first , the elliptic anisotropy should vanish for large transverse momenta , since the additional momentum kick due to the potential becomes negligible .",
    "thus , contrary to ideal hydrodynamics we predict a maximum of the transverse momentum dependent elliptic anisotropy , @xmath11 , which is observed in experiment . at large @xmath12 , of course ,",
    "@xmath4 will be dominated by the attenuation of fast partons in the matter , and it needs to be determined at what momentum this transition will take place @xcite .",
    "second , since for a given temperature the momentum distribution for heavy quarks is titled towards higher momenta , @xmath13 , the resulting elliptic anisotropy for heavy quarks should be considerably smaller than that for light quarks .",
    "in order to study the qualitative features of the proposed single - particle dynamics in a transparent fashion let us start with a simple schematic model .",
    "if we ignore collisions among the partons , the dynamics of the phasespace distribution follows as vlasov equation . to allow for an analytical treatment of the expansion , we assume a gaussian distribution in configuration space and non - relativistic kinematics , resulting in a gaussian momentum space distribution , @xmath14 here , @xmath15 , @xmath16 are the velocities and @xmath17 , @xmath18 denote the widths of the distribution in the transverse @xmath19 , @xmath20 direction , respectively . assuming , for simplicity , that the single particle potential @xmath21 is proportional to the density of the light degrees of freedom , @xmath22 the vlasov equation leads to the following expression for the velocity space distribution , @xmath23 , @xmath24 which can be solved analytically under the assumption that the time dependence of the density follows free streaming , i.e. we ignore the effect of the potential on the density distribution .",
    "a fully consistent solution will require a numerical treatment , which will be briefly discussed below .",
    "since the heavy quarks are rare , we ignore their contribution to the potential , and propagate them in the potential generated by the light degrees of freedom .    to leading order in the initial spatial eccentricity @xmath25",
    "we then obtain the following result for the elliptic anisotropy of the light quarks @xmath26\\ ] ] which only depends on the kinetic energy @xmath27 . here",
    ", @xmath28 is the initial strength of the potential at the center .",
    "we note that @xmath4 is ( a ) proportional to the initial spatial eccentricity , ( b ) proportional to the initial transverse density ( via @xmath29 ) and ( c ) a function of the kinetic energy only .",
    "this is precisely what is seen in experiment .    at a given velocity the heavy quark elliptic anisotropy , @xmath30 ,",
    "is related to that of the light quarks by @xmath31 .",
    "both , @xmath32 and @xmath30 are plotted as a function of the kinetic energy in the left panel of fig.[fig : supress ] for an initial temperature of @xmath33 .",
    "as expected @xmath4 exhibits a maximum , the position of which depends on the choice of initial temperature and is shifted to larger values of the kinetic energy for heavy quarks . as a result the momentum averaged , or integrated anisotropy , @xmath34 , for the heavy quarks is much smaller .",
    "this is shown in left panel of fig.[fig : supress ] , where we plot the ratio of heavy over light quark @xmath4 as a function of the ratio of the quark masses , @xmath35 .",
    "thus , a unique prediction of the single - particle dynamics is that the integrate @xmath4 for heavy quarks , specifically the @xmath1 should be considerably smaller than that for the pions , contrary to hydrodynamics where they should be about equal .     for light quarks ( full line ) and heavy quarks ( dashed line ) .",
    "the dotted line represents the kinetic energy spectrum for both heavy and light quarks .",

    "right panel : ratio of integrated @xmath4 for heavy over light quarks as a function of the ratio of heavy and light quark mass.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "a realistic treatment of the proposed single - particle dynamics requires relativistic kinematics as well as a fully consistent treatment of the vlasov ( boltzmann ) equation . in order to ensure energy momentum conservation",
    "it is best to start from an effective energy functional which is tuned to reproduce the lattice equation of state and from which one derives the single - particle vlasov equation .",
    "the results from such an exercise ( for details see @xcite ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ flo : transport ] .",
    "again we see the same features as in the schematic model , and we find that the intergrated @xmath4 for heavy quarks is considerably smaller than that of light quarks .",
    "in this contribution we have shown that the qualitative features of the observed elliptic anisotropy can be obtained from single - particle dynamics motivated by recent lattice qcd results . in this description",
    "there is no need for a very short mean free path or , equivalently , small viscosities .",
    "this model can be tested in experiment by measuring the elliptic anisotropy of heavy quarkonium , which is predicted to be considerably smaller than that of pions , in contradistinction to the predictions from hydrodynamics .",
