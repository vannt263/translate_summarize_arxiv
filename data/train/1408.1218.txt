    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern generates high energetic proton - proton ( @xmath2 ) collisions with a luminosity of @xmath3 and provides the opportunity to study very high energy physics . after the discovery of higgs boson@xcite , probing new physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) turns to the main goal of the lhc . in such context , studying the heaviest elementary particle , the top quark , is particularly interesting since it is the only fermion with a natural yukawa coupling to the higgs boson of the order of unity .",
    "its charged weak coupling might be sensitive to the existence of an additional heavy fermion .",
    "these couplings can be probed by measuring specific top quark production cross sections and branching ratios .",
    "however , these measurements will be challenging due to the composite internal structure of the colliding particles , i.e. , the large qcd or electroweak ( ew ) backgrounds , the unknown precise centre - of - mass ( c.m.s . )",
    "energy of the collisions occurring between the partons of protons , the complicate composition of underlying events within the central detector , etc . in this case , very high energy interactions involving quasi - real incoming photons may provide a solution to some of these problems .",
    "general diagrams for the photon induced interactions at the lhc is presented in fig.[rpexclusive ] . @xmath4",
    "[ left figure ] refers to the photon - photon ( @xmath5 ) interaction where photons radiated off by both protons collide and produce a central system x. the system x will be detected by the central detector under clean experimental conditions and the two protons remain intact ( namely forward protons ) , escape from the central detection and continue their path close to the beam line .",
    "@xmath6 [ right figure ] corresponds to photoproduction or photon - proton ( @xmath7 ) production : a photon from a proton induces a deep inelastic scattering with the incoming proton and produces a proton remnant y in addition to the centrally produced x system . despite a lower available luminosity",
    ", photoproduction can occur under better known initial conditions , with fewer final states particles and at high energy scale ( @xmath8 ) , thus can be studied as a complementary tool to normal pp collisions at the lhc .",
    "indeed , the cdf collaboration has already observed such kinds of phenomenon including the exclusive dilepton@xcite , diphoton@xcite , dijet @xcite production and charmonium ( @xmath9 ) meson photoproduction@xcite , etc . both the atlas and the cms collaborations have programs of forward physics .",
    "they are devoted to studies of high rapidity regions with extra updated detectors located in a place nearly 100 - 400 m close to the interaction point@xcite .",
    "technical details of the atlas forward physics ( afp ) projects can be found , for example , in refs.@xcite .",
    "a brief review of experimental prospects for studying photon induced interactions are summarized in ref.@xcite .",
    "as previously mentioned , the top quark is the heaviest known elementary particle which makes it an excellent candidate for new physics searches . among top quark production channels ,",
    "single top production has some special features that top pair production can not achieve : it offers a unique possibility of the direct measurement of @xmath10 , the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa quark - mixing matrix ( ckm ) , allowing non - trivial tests of the properties of this matrix in the sm@xcite . in normal pp collision ,",
    "single top produces mainly through two body s - channel ( t - channel ) single top in association with a b ( light ) quark , wt channels and three body @xmath11 channel . here",
    "we focus on the study of wt channel .",
    "this channel is invisible at the tevatron , however , it will be important at the lhc and even comparable to single top s - channel production . even though , its cross section is almost a factor 100 smaller than the most dangerous background coming from the @xmath12 process .",
    "this makes the measurement error of wt process as large as @xmath13 for an integrated luminosity of @xmath14 through normal pp collision@xcite .",
    "single top production can also proceed through @xmath7 collisions mentioned above .",
    "this time through mainly wt and @xmath11 channels .",
    "compare these two channels , we find that cross section of wt channel ( order of @xmath15 ) , is much larger than that of @xmath11 channel ( order of @xmath16 ) , and becomes the most important single top production channel at the @xmath7 collision at the lhc .",
    "this is different from normal @xmath2 collision that @xmath11 production channel accounts for @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) of the total single top quark production cross section , while wt channel stands only @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) at lhc ( tevatron)@xcite . in contrast , wt channel stands over @xmath21 of the top quark photoproductions , since the top pair photoproduction has a cross section of only @xmath22 .",
    "enhancement of the ratio @xmath23 might certainly be a good feature of related measurements through wt channel .",
    "first results on the measurement of the @xmath10 matrix element using wt photoproduction are presented in refs.@xcite .",
    "there comes the conclusion that the expected error on the measurement of @xmath10 is @xmath24 for the semi - leptonic channel and @xmath25 for the leptonic one after @xmath14 of integrated luminosity , while the expected uncertainty from the equivalent study based on partonic interactions is @xmath26 @xcite using the same integrated luminosity , showing that photoproduction is at least competitive with partonic - based studies and that the combination of both studies could lead to significant improvement of the error .",
    "in addition to the @xmath10 measurement , wt photoproduction can also be used to study the w - t - b vertex and test precisely the v - a structure of the charged current weak interaction of the top quark .",
    "anomalous measurement of this vertex may lead direct evidence of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "it may manifest itself via either loop effects or inducing non - sm weak interactions to introduce new single top production channels .",
    "typical studies involve , i.e. , measuring anomalous w - t - b coupling in ep collision@xcite , in normal pp collision@xcite as well as in @xmath7 collision at the lhc@xcite .",
    "ref.@xcite studies @xmath27 up to the leading order ( lo ) induced by anomalous w - t - b coupling . in this case , sm wt photoproduction turns to its irreducible background .",
    "moreover , a lot of studies are performed at the @xmath7 colliders , i.e. , testing anomalous gauge boson couplings @xcite or probing flavour changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) through single top photoproduction@xcite , etc . in cases like these",
    ", sm wt photoproduction turns to be a most important reducible background that needs precise measurement and analysis .",
    "furthermore , determining wt production cross sections and once compared with experiments , will provide a direct access to the bottom quark parton density in nucleons and help understand the nature of the b quark parton distribution function ( pdf ) .    as a result , accurate theoretical predictions including higher order qcd corrections for wt photoproduction",
    "are needed .",
    "nlo qcd corrections for wt production in the normal pp collisions have already been well studied @xcite . in this paper , we present its production at the @xmath7 collision for the first time , assuming a typical lhc multipurpose forward detector , including the nlo qcd corrections via the main reaction @xmath0 .",
    "typically , we use the five - flavor - number schemes ( 5fns ) with massless b quark mass assumption through the whole calculation .",
    "our paper is organized as follow : we build the calculation framework in section 2 including brief introduction to the equivalent photon approximation ( epa ) , general inelastic photoproduction cross section , lo and qcd nlo wt photoproductions .",
    "section 3 is arranged to present the input parameters , cross checks and numerical results of our study .",
    "finally we summarize our conclusions in the last section .",
    "generic diagrams for the photon induced production at the cern lhc : @xmath4 [ left figure ] and @xmath6 [ right figure ] . ]    in our paper , we focus on the discussion of photoproductions @xmath6 through @xmath7 collisioins see fig.[rpexclusive][right figure ] .",
    "photoproduction is a class of processes in which one of the two interacting protons is not destroyed during the collision but survive into the final state with additional particle ( or particles ) state(s ) .",
    "protons of this kind are named intact or forward protons .",
    "the kinematics of a forward proton is often described by means of the reduced energy loss @xmath28 , which is also defined as the forward detector acceptance : @xmath29 where e is the initial energy of the beam and @xmath30 is the square of the centre - of - mass energy .",

    ". however , @xmath7 collisions have higher energy and effective luminosity with respect to @xmath5 collisions .",
    "processes through @xmath5 or @xmath7 interactions involve photon exchange with proton beams at the lhc which can be described by the appropriate framework of equivalent photon ( or weizs@xmath33cker - williams ) approximation ( epa ) @xcite . in the framework of epa ,",
    "emitted quasi - real photons from the protons have a low virtuality and scattered with small angles from the beam pipe .",

    "and we address here that during calculation , we use the @xmath28 , @xmath34 dependent form of eq.([totcrosssection ] ) .",
    "we use the five - flavor - number scheme ( 5fns ) in our whole lo and qcd nlo calculations . as we see , at tree level in the 5fns scheme the wt photoproduction process consists of only one partonic subprocess , namely @xmath93 , as illustrated in fig.[figrbwtborn ] .",
    "indeed , wt photoproduction can also be produced in the four - flavor - number scheme ( 4fns ) where the b quark is treated as massive and there is no b quark parton density is assumed in the initial state . in this scheme ,",
    "the lo contribution starts from @xmath94 with 1b tagged in the final state .",
    "the first order of qcd corrections in 4fns consist of virtual one - loop corrections to the tree - level subprocesses as well as real corrections in the form of other two subprocesses with an additional radiated parton , namely @xmath95 and @xmath96 . in the 4fns scheme , b quark do not enter in the computation of the running of @xmath97 and the evolution of the pdfs .",
    "finite @xmath98 effects enter via power corrections of the type @xmath99 and logarithms of the type @xmath100 where q stands for the hard scale of the process . at the lhc ,",
    "typically @xmath101 and power corrections are suppressed , while logarithms , both of initial and final state nature , could be large .",
    "these large logarithms could in principle spoil the convergence of fixed order calculations and a resummation could be required . up to nlo accuracy",
    "those potentially large logarithms , @xmath102 , are replaced by @xmath103 with @xmath104 and are less significant numerically .",
    "as can be see , the difference between adopting the 5fns and 4fns is the ordering of the perturbative series for the production cross section . in the 4fns",
    "the perturbative series is ordered strictly by powers of the strong coupling @xmath97 , while in the 5fns the introduction of the b quark pdf allows to resum terms of the form @xmath105 at all orders in @xmath97 .",
    "if all orders in perturbation theory were taken into account , these two schemes are identical in describing logarithmic effects .",
    "but the way of ordering in the perturbative expansion is different and at any finite order the results might be different .",
    "many works have been done in the comparison of the 5fns and 4fns schemes , see refs.@xcite , etc . a latest comparison in the 4fns and 5fns schemes in ref.@xcite present that being often the effects of resummation very mild , 4fns calculations can be put to use , on the other hand , for 5nfs schemes , i.e. , can typically provide quite accurate predictions for total rates and being simpler , in some cases allow the calculations to be performed at nnlo .",
    "we address the interesting of considering both schemes while here we use 5fns in our calculation . even in 5fns",
    ", it will be interesting to consider two schemes @xcite : one is the massless b quark scheme where we drop the mass of b quark during calculation while the other is the massive b quark scheme where we retain it everywhere .    in our paper",

    "such resonant becomes extremely large in certain phase space region and renders the perturbative computation of the wt cross section meaningless , thus should be preferable excluded from the nlo corrections to the wt process .",

    "this scheme has be done in some other refs like @xcite , etc .",
    "some attention should be paid to the light-(anti)quark emission subprocess , see figs.5(5 ) and fig.5(10 ) .",
    "contributions from these two diagrams can be considered as part of the nlo ew corrections to the lo process @xmath143 through normal pp collision .",
    "since we concentrate on the photoproduction of @xmath144 where forward protons are considered , the @xmath143 and its full nlo ew corrections are not taken into account .",
    "then , the subprocesses in figs . 5(5 ) and 5(10 ) are defined applying a small @xmath141 cut on the tagged b quark , which regularize the collinear splitting of the photon into a @xmath145 pair . indeed , the choice of specific kinematical cuts to select events in the forward region ( small @xmath141 cut applied on the tagged b quark ) forces the contributions from these two diagrams to be quite small .",
    "thus , even when one is forced to consider them as part of the nlo qcd corrections to the @xmath146 production process , their contribution results for only but a tiny theoretical uncertainty .    then the cross section for each of the real emission partonic processes can be written as @xmath147 . after integrating over the photon and quark spectra",

    "<S> in this paper we study the single top and w boson associated photoproduction via the main reaction @xmath0 at the 14 tev large hadron collider ( lhc ) up to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd level assuming a typical lhc multipurpose forward detector . </S>",
    "<S> we use the five - flavor - number schemes ( 5fns ) with massless bottom quark assumption in the whole calculation . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the qcd nlo corrections can reduce the scale uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> the typical k - factors are in the range of 1.15 to 1.2 which lead to the qcd nlo corrections of 15@xmath1 to 20@xmath1 correspond to the leading - order ( lo ) predictions with our chosen parameters .    </S>",
