    "we propose a set of reduction rules applicable to spin glasses at @xmath9 on any sparse graph and arbitrary bond distribution .",
    "these reductions strip graphs of all variables that are connected to at most two neighbors while accounting _ exactly _ for the ground state energy , entropy , and approximately for the overlap distribution of the system . in this paper",
    ", we introduce these reduction rules , and test them on the hierarchical lattice ( see fig .",
    "[ hierlat ] ) obtained from the migdal - kadanoff bond - moving scheme @xcite .",
    "the recursive nature of the hierarchical lattice permits us to quickly reduce the equivalent of @xmath10 graphs with lengths corresponding to @xmath4 in @xmath5 and @xmath7 in @xmath8 dimensions , limited only by accumulating rounding errors . throughout this paper",
    "we focus exclusively on @xmath5 and  4 , and use only a discrete bond distribution , @xmath11 but our procedure is equally applicable to any continuous bond distribution , such as a gaussian .",
    "the reduction produces high - accuracy results for the scaling of the defect energy width @xmath12 with @xmath1 .",
    "we also study the diluted lattice , where @xmath13 shall refer to the fraction of occupied bonds , and show that this scaling emerges for all @xmath14 . the critical point @xmath15",
    "@xcite is particular to the bond distribution in eq .",
    "( [ bondeq ] ) and located just above the percolation point @xmath16 of the lattice . since @xmath17 is a purely topological property of the lattice itself , having @xmath18 is merely a necessary condition for long - range correlated behavior in a spin glass .",
    "cooperative effects from the bond disorder suppress correlations even for @xmath19 , as was already discussed in ref .",
    "correspondingly , the moment @xmath20 of the overlap distribution  @xcite becomes non - zero only at @xmath21 , while the ground state energy and entropy remain smooth for all @xmath22 , even at the transition .",
    "both , entropy and overlap , exhibit an extremum at some @xmath14 which can be explained in terms of the peculiar lattice hierarchy .",
    "1.1 in    this study suggests that the reduction method provides a powerful means to explore the ( potential ) onset of replica symmetry breaking ( rsb )  @xcite on finite - dimensional spin glasses for arbitrary bond distributions at @xmath9 but variable @xmath13 .",
    "the onset of glassy behavior ( albeit _ not _ rsb ) in the migdal - kadanoff model at @xmath21 , close to and intrinsically linked with @xmath17 , may suggest such a close link between percolation and the possible onset of rsb in realistic lattice models , which we are currently exploring @xcite .",
    "in fact , we already found a transition for the stiffness exponent in real three- and four - dimensional edwards - anderson models , resembling the one observed here , at a @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "considered in terms of the average connectivity @xmath24 of spins , dilute lattice glasses as well as the hierarchical lattice at @xmath9 behave strikingly similar to many mean - field models , which are currently studied in the context of combinatorial optimization  @xcite .",
    "those models also enter into a glassy state ( exhibiting rsb ) at some finite connectivity @xmath25 , above a finite - connectivity percolation transition @xmath26 .",
    "but in mean - field models the onset of rsb is often studied as a precursor to yet another critical point , the satisfiability transition @xcite , whereas geometrically defined models are unsatisfiable at any finite connectivity .",
    "these features should be independent of the bond distribution , assuming zero mean and unit variance .",
    "while the hierarchical lattice is completely reducible , diluted realistic lattices will become irreducible soon above percolation , in which case our algorithm  @xcite is used to reduce any graph as much as possible first , followed by a complete exploration of the ground states of the far more compact remainder graph using the extremal optimization heuristic @xcite . with this hybrid approach ,",
    "we are typically able to compute ground state energies , entropies and overlaps for graphs 10 - 100 times larger than previously recorded , extending well beyond the percolation point .",
    "to illustrate the reduction method , and to test our algorithm , we consider here the hierarchical lattice ( see fig .",
    "[ hierlat ] ) , obtained in the migdal - kadanoff real - space renormalization scheme @xcite for low - dimensional spin glasses .",
    "these lattices have a simple recursive , yet geometric , structure and are well - studied @xcite .",
    "most importantly , they are completely reducible , and we can discuss the method independently of any subsequent optimization that may be required for more complicated models . the most interesting property of these lattices is the curious fact that the scaling of its defect energy distribution behaves very similar to that measured for actual two- and three - dimensional lattices @xcite .    as described in fig .",
    "[ hierlat ] , starting from generation @xmath27 with a single link , at each subsequent generation @xmath28 , all links from @xmath29 are replace with a new subgraph .",
    "the structure of the subgraph arises from the bond - moving scheme in @xmath30 dimensions , and has @xmath31 links for @xmath5 here .",
    "thus , a hierarchical lattice of generation @xmath29 has @xmath32 links , thus corresponding to a @xmath30-dimensional lattice of `` length '' @xmath33 but @xmath34 vertices .",
    "while the average connectivity is @xmath35 , the two root - vertices from generation @xmath27 themselves obtain in generation @xmath36 a connectivity of @xmath37 , and @xmath38 vertices are only two - connected , i.  e. 7 in 8 for @xmath5 .",
    "the diluted hierarchical lattice percolates when there is a path between the two root - vertices .",
    "this notion leads to a simple recursion relation for the percolation threshold by counting the weights of all diluted subgraphs from fig .",
    "[ hierlat ] that percolate : @xmath39 which has a non - trivial stationary point at @xmath40 .",
    "it has been pointed out by ref .",
    "@xcite that a spin glass with the discrete @xmath41-bond distribution in eq .",
    "( [ bondeq ] ) exhibits instead a critical transition between a paramagnetic and a spin glass phase at @xmath15 , which is closely related to the percolation transition .",
    "while below @xmath17 disconnected bonds ( @xmath42 ) clearly dominate and prevent long - range correlations , even for @xmath19 such correlations remain suppressed due to the cooperative behavior of parallel bond structure pervasive in the lattice that lead to many cancellations ( see `` double rule '' in sec .  [ rules ] ) and additionally disconnects subgraphs at some higher level of the hierarchy .",
    "in the ising spin glass problem we assign to each vertex @xmath43 of a graph or lattice , @xmath44 , a spin variable @xmath45 , while each link between two connected vertices @xmath43 and @xmath46 obtains a bond variable @xmath47 that is drawn at random from some distribution @xmath48 , which may be discrete or continuous .",
    "the problem consists of finding spin configurations @xmath49 which minimize the hamiltonian , or total energy , @xmath50 for a fixed ( quenched ) set of bonds @xmath47 . of course , for @xmath51 ( only ferromagnetic bonds ) , the solution is simply to make all connected spins aligned with each other .",
    "but if some or all bonds are negative , and spins are sufficiently connected , the problem can be frustrated @xcite and solutions become nontrivial .    in the following ,",
    "we explain the rules by which to eliminate recursively all two - connected spins while accounting for the energy , entropy , and approximate overlap of ground - state configurations . to this end",
    "we have to generalize bonds by adding internal degrees of freedom , which evolve during the reduction process .",
    "each bond between two spins @xmath43 and @xmath46 now consists of a tuple @xmath52 where @xmath47 is the weight of the bond , @xmath53 is the entropy accumulated by the bond , and @xmath54 counts the number of previously reduced spins whose state is _ completely determined _ ( `` entrained '' ) by the bond for @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "in addition , there is an energy offset @xmath56 accounting for the energy difference between the original and the reduced graph . in general , determining entropy and overlap from the @xmath57- and @xmath58-values can be quite complicated for the interesting case of an irreducible remainder graph  @xcite . for the completely reducible hierarchical lattice , it is a lot simpler and we will describe it below .",
    "initially , for the unreduced graph , all @xmath57- and @xmath58-values and @xmath59 are zero , and the bonds are drawn from one of the usual distributions , for example , eq .",
    "( [ bondeq ] ) .",
    "these rules are elaborate but easily enumerated , _",
    "independent _ of the previous or future structure of the graph or the spin configuration",
    ". a more complete set of rules including zero- , one- , and three - connected vertices required for arbitrary graphs will be presented elsewhere @xcite . there",
    ", each spin @xmath43 obtains one additional number @xmath60 ( aside from its state @xmath61 ) that counts the previously eliminated spins whose state is entrained to @xmath43 .    to demonstrate the use of these extra degrees of freedom , consider ,",
    "for instance , the reduction of a one - connected spin @xmath46 : it and its bond @xmath62 to its sole neighbor @xmath43 disappears from the graph , and the connectivity of @xmath43 is decremented .",
    "the new graph will have itself a ground state energy offset by @xmath63 relative to the unreduced graph , i.  e. @xmath64 .",
    "for @xmath65 ( a possibility we eventually have to allow for , even if our unreduced bond distribution did not ) , all information contained in @xmath62 is discarded and @xmath60 does nt change , since @xmath66 is free to take on any value @xmath67 in the ground state ; only the entropy of the old graph is offset by @xmath68 with respect to the new graph . in turn , for @xmath51 ( @xmath69 ) , @xmath46 is entrained to the state of @xmath43 in any ground state configuration , and @xmath60 is incremented .",
    "if the bond @xmath62 had previously inherited nonzero entropies @xmath53 and entrainments @xmath54 , there would be an offset in entropy by @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) between the reduced and the original graph , and @xmath60 would be further increased by @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) ; @xmath71 ( @xmath70 ) and @xmath73 ( @xmath72 ) are discarded because the ground state _ must _ have @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) .    with the two - point rule we use exclusively in this paper , a spin variable @xmath61 and its",
    "two bonds @xmath76 and @xmath77 are replaced by a new bond @xmath78 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath79 which assigns to @xmath80 the bond with the smaller modulus and the sign of @xmath81 .",
    "the energy offset @xmath59 , accounting for the energy of the original graph , will have to be lowered by @xmath82 at this level , our reduction rules correspond to the familiar traces ( at @xmath9 ) used many times before to study the hierarchical lattice ( see , e.  g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "clearly , for @xmath83 , the reduced spin @xmath43 is entrained to the neighbor with the bond of larger modulus , while the weaker bond may be violated .",
    "the entropy and entrainment variables that @xmath78 inherits from the two reduced bonds are controlled by the sign of the stronger one .",
    "we can summarize these rules by defining @xmath84 and @xmath85 as the bond with the stronger and weaker ( in modulus ) weight , respectively .",
    "then , we obtain for the new bond : @xmath86 the case @xmath87 leads to further distinctions : @xmath88    finally , we need a rule to combine double bonds , which will be created eventually .",
    "when two bonds , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , connect the same two spins , they are simply replaced with a new bond @xmath89 it is important to note that the two - point and double rules only effect the newly created bond and the energy offset , but not the two neighboring spins ( or the entropy offset ) . unlike for the one - point rule , we do not need to consider an internal entrainment number for spins here .",
    "with the reduction rules from sec .",
    "[ rules ] , it is now straightforward to evaluate hierarchical lattices of any size . in effect , these rules allow us to reverse the generating mechanism depicted in fig .",
    "[ hierlat ] .",
    "recursively , from one generation to the next , we reduce all two - connected spins in the middle of the subgraph first , then use the double - bond rule sequentially , until a single , reduced bond is left .",
    "once an entire graph has been reduced into such a single bond , the weight @xmath90 of that bond is in fact half the defect energy , @xmath91 , of that graph , i.  e. the energy difference between having both root spins aligned and anti - aligned .",
    "the entropy of that graph is simply given by @xmath92 , or by @xmath93 $ ] for @xmath42 .",
    "the energy of the graph can be obtained from the running energy - offset @xmath94 , accounting for the reduction of bonds along the way , and @xmath90 . for our purposes , it is more useful to extract the ( non - negative ) `` cost '' of a graph given by the absolute weight of all violated bonds for any bond distribution . in case of the discrete @xmath41 distribution in eq .",
    "( [ bondeq ] ) , this sum reduces to a count of all violate bonds ( all of absolute weight 1 ) @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the average number of non - vanishing bonds in a graph . as an approximate measure of the overlap",
    ", we merely store the largest entrainment number @xmath97 observed at any point during the reduction process , which is a measure of the largest correlated cluster of spins within the lattice .",
    "the size of this cluster will either dominate the overlap ( with smaller clusters adding some negligible fluctuations ) in the spin glass state or be itself a vanishing fluctuation in the paramagnetic state .",
    "although these measurements are not difficult , the reduction of ever larger graphs soon becomes untenable , since the cost of reducing true graphs would grow by a factor of @xmath98 for each generation .",
    "instead , we exploit the fact that each subgraph within the hierarchy is independent of any other parallel subgraph . as",
    "above , we reduce all graphs down to a single bond . to assemble a graph of generation @xmath28",
    "we only need a large enough pool of independent graphs of generation @xmath29 .",
    "in fact , _ many nearly - independent _ graphs of generation @xmath28 can be assembled by repeatedly drawing at random on @xmath98 graphs of generation @xmath29 from that pool .",
    "we proceed as follows : assume that we already possess a pool of @xmath99 reduced graphs at every generation @xmath29 ( up to a maximal generation @xmath100 ) , each graph represented by its bond @xmath78 , @xmath94 , and @xmath97 .",
    "each cycle of the algorithm generates an elementary subgraph ( generation @xmath101 ) with bonds @xmath90 drawn from the bond distribution in eq .",
    "( [ bondeq ] ) and empty entropy , entrainment , @xmath59 , and @xmath97 variables .",
    "the elementary subgraph is reduced to obtain a bond @xmath78 of the first generation , _ replacing _ the oldest entry in pool @xmath102 .",
    "after every @xmath103th new reduced bond entering into pool @xmath104 , we randomly assemble @xmath98 such bonds into a new subgraph to create a new reduced bond to be entered into pool @xmath99 , as long as @xmath105 .",
    "if we choose @xmath106 and assemble bonds sequentially instead of at random , this algorithm produces exact hierarchical lattices , where each subgraph is certain to be independent . but to obtain just one graph of , say , generation @xmath107 , we have to assemble @xmath108 elementary subgraphs for @xmath5 . instead",
    ", for all @xmath13 not too close to @xmath21 , we simply choose large pools , @xmath109 , and as small as @xmath110 .",
    "that is , each time we assemble an elementary graphs at @xmath27 , we enter its value to pool @xmath102 , assemble a subgraph out of @xmath102 , add the reduced bond to pool @xmath111 , etc , all the way up to @xmath112 in each cycle .",
    "hence , our implementation becomes _ independent _ of @xmath1 , and for instance at @xmath113 we have assembled graphs up to generation @xmath114 in @xmath5 and @xmath115 in @xmath8 , corresponding to @xmath4 or @xmath116 , respectively .",
    "@xmath100 is only limited by apparent limits on floating point accuracy due to repeated cancellation between almost equal bonds .",
    "note that each pool gets completely refreshed after @xmath99 creations of new graphs from the pool just below it , while there are about @xmath117 different subgraphs that could be created out of each pool at any one time .    every time a graph gets added to a pool",
    ", its properties are evaluated from its @xmath78 , @xmath59 , and @xmath97 . while ground state energy , entropy , and ( approximate )",
    "overlap converge quickly with @xmath29 , and throughout are quite independent of the choice of @xmath103 and @xmath99 , the measurement of the defect energy becomes quite sensitive to the algorithmic parameters near @xmath21 . in those cases , we increase @xmath103 ( and lower @xmath100 correspondingly ) , until stable results were obtained . only at @xmath118 ,",
    "the exact algorithm was necessary to observe the true defect energy distribution .",
    "using the algorithm from sec .",
    "[ algo ] , we have studied various properties of a ising spin glass with bond distribution as given in eq .",
    "( [ bondeq ] ) on the diluted and undiluted hierarchical lattice .",
    "in fact , using the easiest implementation with @xmath110 , pool sizes of @xmath109 , and @xmath119 , we first scanned lattices for @xmath120 in steps of @xmath121 . at each @xmath13 and @xmath29 , we averaged over @xmath122 values .",
    "we found that for each @xmath13 , the ground state energies per spin , entropies per spin , and the moment of the overlap , @xmath20 were well - converged at @xmath119 , and insensitive to the choice of @xmath103 using trials with @xmath123 .",
    "we also found the width of the defect energy distribution , @xmath124 , to be stable except for @xmath125 . for large @xmath126",
    "the distribution of defect energies either collapses into a @xmath127-function at zero for small @xmath13 , or eventually converges to the distribution of the undiluted lattice ( @xmath113 ) . near @xmath128 ,",
    "the evolution of that distribution becomes highly sensitive to small fluctuations , and the minute statistical dependencies inherent in our algorithm for small @xmath103 escalate .",
    "thus , we ran another scan for @xmath129 using @xmath123 and @xmath130 graphs at @xmath119 ( and hence gaining a factor @xmath103 more graphs at each lower generation @xmath29 ) .",
    "now , only for @xmath131 did @xmath12 become unstable ( by comparison with trial runs at @xmath132 ) .",
    "finally , for @xmath133 , we used an exact algorithm and indeed found @xmath134 to be horizontal for many generations until it eventually decays , indicating that @xmath135 , consistent with the expected value of @xmath136 from ref .",
    "the results for @xmath12 as a function of @xmath126 for all @xmath13 are shown in fig .",

    "we plot the number of violated bonds ( or cost ) per spin , entropy per spin , and a characteristic moment of the ( approximate ) overlap distribution for @xmath137 and @xmath5 .",
    "the cost is already non - zero for small @xmath13 , rising consistent with @xmath138 , proportional to the probability of creating a small , frustrated loop that requires four bonds . just beyond @xmath21 ,",
    "the cost per spin rises more slowly , but without drastic changes for any @xmath13 .",
    "similarly , the entropy density in fig .  [ mkentropy ] remains unaffected by the transition at @xmath21 , as is expected @xcite .",
    "instead , it reaches a minimum at about @xmath139 that is an artifact of the hierarchical lattice .",
    "the large majority of spins in the graph ( a fraction @xmath140 for @xmath5 ) are at most two - connected spins whose contribution dominates the entropy density . in a fully bonded graph ( @xmath113 ) , about half of these spins are free , the other half is constraint , with an energy density of @xmath141 .",
    "for small dilutions @xmath142 , about every removed bond turns a two - connected spin into a one - connected spin , which is _ always _ constrained , and the entropy declines . eventually , at large dilution ( small @xmath13 ) , an increasing number of one - connected spins become totally disconnected and free again , raising to entropy density to its ultimate value , @xmath143 , for the unconnected ( @xmath144 ) lattice . by this argument",
    "the entropy density should be given simply by @xmath145\\ln(2 ) , \\label{seq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which fits the data exceedingly well .    2.0 in    2.0 in    in contrast with energy and entropy , the overlap distribution is clearly sensitive to the transition from paramagnetic to glassy behavior at @xmath21 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ mkoverlap ] .",
    "there , we plot only its moment , since the distribution itself quickly converges to a structureless @xmath127-peak as expected for a model that is replica symmetric ( rs ) throughout .",
    "in fact , we find that @xmath146 to within 1% for all @xmath13 .",
    "( for one , a broad overlap distribution indicative of widely separated ground state configurations and rsb  @xcite would be antithetical to the reducibility of the hierarchical lattice . ) about at @xmath21 , the location of the peak becomes non - zero and splits into two symmetric peaks , leading to a non - zero moment @xmath20 .",
    "the moment experiences a surprising maximum very close to @xmath113 , varying sharply for small dilutions .",
    "again , the maximum may be explained in terms of the abundance of two - connected spins : whatever the size of strongly correlated spin clusters may be in the fully connected lattice ( @xmath113 ) , the overwhelming conversion of two - connected to one - connected spins at small dilution can only increase the size of those clusters at its edge , since one - connected spins are always entrained .",
    "but more importantly , the elimination of two - connected spins , say , within a subgraph as shown in fig .",
    "[ hierlat ] will _ enhance _ the probability that the two root - spins of that subgraph become correlated , which would _ merge _ the clusters that those spins are part of .",
    "while the latter effect could suddenly increase the size of typical clusters by a factor , it is not clear whether the steep slope observed at @xmath113 is not an artifact of our approximation to the overlap ( see sec .",
    "[ algo ] ) .",
