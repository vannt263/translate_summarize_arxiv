    "this paper is devoted to the problem of the high probability state transfer ( hpst ) @xcite among many nodes of the spin system and to the relationship between probabilities of hpsts and entanglements responsible for these transfers .",
    "we consider nuclear spin-1/2 systems with xxz - hamiltonian and different geometrical configurations .",
    "however , the above relationship remains valid for any hamiltonian @xmath2 commuting with the total projection operator @xmath0 .    by `` state transfer '' we mean the following phenomenon @xcite .",
    "consider the chain of spin-1/2 with dipole - dipole interaction in the strong external magnetic field .",
    "let all spins be directed along the external magnetic field except the @xmath3th one whose initial state is arbitrary .",
    "in other words , let the spin system be prepared in the state @xmath4 is a ground state , i.e. all spins are directed along the magnetic field and @xmath5 means that only @xmath3th spin is directed opposite to the external magnetic field ( i.e. @xmath3th spin is excited ) .",
    "let the energy of the ground state be zero .",
    "if the state becomes @xmath6 with @xmath7 at the time moment @xmath8 then we say that the initial state has been transferred from the @xmath3th to the @xmath9th node with the phase shift @xmath10 .",
    "since @xmath11 , all other spins are directed along the field at @xmath8 .",
    "here @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the transition amplitude of an excited state from the @xmath3th to the @xmath9th node : @xmath14 .",
    "it is known @xcite that the effectiveness of the state transfer between the @xmath3th and @xmath9th nodes may be characterised by the fidelity @xmath15 @xmath16 we see that the fidelity is maximal for @xmath17 @xmath18 .",
    "if the external magnetic field is homogeneous and we are interested in the state propagation between two nodes , say between @xmath19th and @xmath20th nodes at the moment @xmath21 , then condition @xmath22 may be simply satisfied by the proper choice of the constant magnetic field value @xcite . in this case",
    "the fidelity @xmath23 takes maximal value together with absolute value of the transition amplitude @xmath24 .",
    "for this reason , namely @xmath25 ( rather then @xmath26 ) is considered as the characteristic of the state transfer in many refs , see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "it is clear that @xmath27 may be replaced by the probability of the excited state transfer @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "more general case of the hpsts among many nodes of the @xmath30 node spin chain has been studied in @xcite . in this case",
    "any particular state transfer between the @xmath3th and @xmath9th nodes is associated with its own phase shift @xmath31 , @xmath32 ( note that @xmath3 may be equal to @xmath9 which means return of the state to the @xmath3th node ) .",
    "however , it is important that all these shifts may be eliminated using magnetic field properly depending on time @xcite . for this reason",
    "the effectiveness of the state transfer between the @xmath3th and the @xmath9th nodes may be equivalently described either by the fidelity @xmath33 or by the probability of the excited state transfer @xmath34 even in this generalized case .",
    "namely optimization of @xmath34 allows us to find all necessary parameters of the geometrical spin configuration providing hpsts among many nodes while phases @xmath31 may be removed by the appropriate time dependent external magnetic field as it was done in @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we will study the probability of the single excited state transfer instead of the fidelity ( [ fidelity ] ) of arbitrary state transfer in the subsequent sections of this paper .",
    "this means that the spin 1/2 system of @xmath30 nodes is prepared in the initial state @xmath35 where @xmath3 takes one of the values @xmath36 .",
    "the problem of the perfect state transfers ( psts ) , hpsts and entanglements in the spin systems is very attractive and different aspects of this problem have been studied in many details @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , most of the results are devoted to the linear and circular spin chains , which are considered as communication channels in the quantum information systems .",
    "different hamiltonians describing these chains have been studied , such as @xmath37 , @xmath38 , heisenderg hamiltonians .",
    "usually , the approximation of the nearest neighbour interactions is taken as a basic tool for such studies .",
    "note , that this is a good approximation in the case of , for instance , exchange interaction , when coupling constants decrease exponentially with increase in the distance .",
    "however , this approximation is not satisfactory for the spin systems with dipole - dipole interaction ( such as nuclear spin systems in solids ) and a wide spread of the coupling constants .",
    "most efforts have been turned to the study of two phenomena : the state transfer along chains @xcite and two - qubit entanglements in chains ( such as entanglement between end nodes or between nearest nodes @xcite ) .",
    "the wootters criterion is applicable in this case allowing one to describe the entanglement in terms of so - called concurrence @xcite .",
    "it is important that there is an analytical dependence of the concurrence between two nodes on the probability of the state transfer between these nodes which was derived in @xcite for the system with single excited spin .",
    "however , complicated system of @xmath30 spins exhibits entanglements not only between two nodes , but also between arbitrary two subsystems .",
    "these entanglements may be effectively described by the positive partial transpose ( ppt ) criterion @xcite introducing so - called double negativity as a measure of entanglement .",
    "explicit relations of the double negativity associated with two subsystems on the probabilities of the excited state transfers between different nodes will be derived in this paper for the spin system with single excitation .    although the pst would be preferable in the quantum communication chains , it is hardly realizable in experiments with long chains because of the following two basic reasons :    1",
    ".   theoretical prediction of the pst in the long chains is associated with the approximation of the hamiltonian by the nearest neighbour interaction , while the complete hamiltonian must be used in practice . as we have already noted , this approximation is well applicable to the systems with exchange interaction and is not always valid for the systems with dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "coupling constants may not be always known as accurately as we want in the case of both exchange and dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "thus , hpst between different nodes of the spin system @xcite seems to be more realistic in comparison with pst .    in this paper",
    "we will study the spin systems with dipole - dipole interaction in the external magnetic field with single excited node described by the @xmath1 hamiltonian .",
    "we will study the spin systems with different geometrical configurations of nodes and initial state ( [ initial ] ) which may provide the hpsts of the excited state among all of nodes",
    ". we will show which parts of the spin system must be entangled in order to provide each of these transfers .",
    "the study of two- and three - dimensional spin systems is important because they are more compact and consequently they are more promising as quantum registers and/or short communication channels .",
    "it will be shown in this paper , that namely such configurations ( more precisely , spin configurations with nodes placed in the corners of either rectangle or parallelepiped ) provide the hpsts among several different nodes of the spin system during relatively short time interval in comparison with the line systems @xcite which is important for the development of the quantum information systems and/or short communication channels .",
    "our study is also stimulated by the experiments on the quantum information processes in solids @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "in sec.[section : xyz ] ( and in appendices [ app : wootters ] and [ app : ppt ] ) we obtain analytical dependence of the either concurrences ( wootters criterion ) or double negativities ( ppt criterion ) between different two subsystems of the spin system on the probabilities of the state transfers , generalizing the results of refs.@xcite . in sec.[section : two_nodes ] we consider the simplest one - dimensional model of two nodes where the relationship between entanglement and probability of the state transfer is most transparent and an equivalent result may be obtained using either the wootters @xcite or ppt criterion .",
    "two - dimensional spin systems will be considered in sec.[section : four_nodes ] , see also appendix [ app:4nodes ] .",
    "we arrange hpst among all nodes of the four - node spin system ( rectangular geometry ) and show that the external magnetic field directed along one of the sides of the rectangle decreases significantly ( more then twice ) the time intervals needed for the hpsts among nodes in comparison with the case when the field is perpendicular to the plane of the rectangle .",
    "similar study of the three - dimensional eight - node system ( with spins placed in the corners of the parallelepiped ) is represented in sec.[section : eight_nodes ] , see also appendix [ app:8nodes ] .",
    "it is evident that hpsts may not be effectively arranged in the arbitrary system of nodes .",
    "detailed algorithm allowing one to obtain parameters of the rectangle spin system ( namely , the ratio of sides of the rectangle ) with the hpsts among all four nodes is given in appendix [ app:4nodes ] .",
    "particular example of the eight - node three - dimensional spin system with hpsts among all nodes ( parallelepiped configuration ) is represented in appendix [ app:8nodes ] .",
    "we study the hpsts and entanglements among the nodes of the spin-1/2 system in the external magnetic field described by the @xmath1 hamiltonian with zero larmor frequencies : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath41 is the distance between @xmath3th and @xmath9th spins , @xmath42 is the angle between the external magnetic field and @xmath41 , @xmath43 is the projection operator of the @xmath3th spin on the @xmath44 axis , @xmath45 , @xmath46 are the dipole - dipole coupling constants . this hamiltonian describes the secular part of the dipole - dipole interaction in the strong external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "we denote @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "taking into account the definition of @xmath46 , for description of the spin system with arbitrary geometrical configuration we use the coordinates of each node , i.e. the set of the following triads @xmath49 so that @xmath50 it is important , that the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) commutes with @xmath0 ( @xmath51-projection of the total spin ) : @xmath52=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this means that both @xmath2 and @xmath0 have the common set of eigenvectors .",
    "it is convenient to write the eigenvectors of the operator @xmath0 in terms of the dirac notations .",
    "let latexmath:[\\ ] ] and @xmath323 are given by eqs.([p^n],[8_eigenvectors],[8_eigenvalues ] ) ."
