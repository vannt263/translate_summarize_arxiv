    "stable metal wires having diameters in the range of nanometer are very important for nanoelectronics and other nanodevice applications .",
    "metal nanowires  @xcite and monoatomic chains  @xcite produced so far have played a crucial role in understanding quantum transport and exotic atomic structure.@xcite earlier , those wires were not reproducible and controllable to offer any relevant technological application .",
    "recently , it has been shown that such nanowires can be produced by depositing metal atoms on carbon nanotube templates.@xcite because of its curvature the surface of a single wall carbon nanotube ( swnt ) is chemically more reactive than graphite .",
    "therefore stable bonding can occur between the swnt and metal adatom.@xcite recently , mo - ge superconducting nanowires were fabricated using sputter deposition on carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "continuous titanium coating of varying thickness , and quasi continuous coating of ni and pd were obtained by using electron - beam evaporation techniques,@xcite whereas au , al , fe , pd were able to form only discrete particles or clusters rather than a continuous coating of the swnt .",
    "nevertheless , coating of virtually any metal on swnt can be mediated by depositing first titanium as a buffer layer.@xcite    swnts seem to be ideal templates for synthesizing a variety of stable nanowires with different diameter , thickness and length of elemental metals .",
    "it is therefore important to have a good understanding of metal - swnt interactions and mechanism of metal coverage . in this paper",
    ", we address this issue from first - principles by studying structural and electronic properties of al adsorption starting from a single atom adsorption to monolayer coverage .",
    "we find that the al - al interaction is relatively stronger than the al - swnt interaction , yielding al - cluster formation rather than a uniform coating over the swnt for most of the cases .",
    "however , we discovered that stable al nanoring and also al tube can form at well - defined and ordered positions over the @xmath0 swnt .",
    "furthermore , we estimate that the current through the al nanorings can produce large magnetic fields at the tip of a nanotube .",
    "we hope that these findings will shed light into the usage of nanotubes as a template to grow metal nanowires with many novel properties .",
    "the first principles total energy and electronic structure calculations have been performed using the pseudopotential plane wave method  @xcite within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga )  @xcite .",
    "a tetragonal supercell have been used with lattice constants , @xmath1  and @xmath2 , which is taken to be equal to the 1d lattice parameter , @xmath3 , of the tube . to minimize the adsorbate - adsorbate interaction ,",
    "some calculations are performed in longer supercells by taking @xmath4 .",
    "we used ultra - soft pseudopotentials  @xcite for carbon and aluminum atoms and plane waves up to an energy cutoff of 310 ev .",
    "brillouin zone integrations are performed with 12 - 6 special * k*-points .",
    "all atomic positions of adsorbate and nanotube as well as @xmath3 are fully optimized .",
    "we first explored the possible adsorption sites for an individual al atom on a ( 8,0 ) nanotube ; namely * h - sites * which are above the center of hexagons , * z- * and * b - sites * which are above the zigzag and axial c - c bonds , respectively , and finally * t - sites * which are on top of the carbon atoms .",
    "the binding energy is obtained from the expression , @xmath5 + e_{t}[al ] - e_{t}[al+swnt ] \\label{eq : bind}\\ ] ] in terms of the total energies of the fully optimized bare nanotube ( @xmath6 $ ] ) , the atomic al ( @xmath7 $ ] ) , and the al adsorbed nanotube ( @xmath8 $ ] ) . all total energy calculations are carried out in the same supercell with @xmath4 . according to the above definition stable structures have positive binding energies .",
    "we find that the bindings at the t - sites are unstable ; the adatoms move to the h - sites upon relaxation .",
    "the bindings at the h- , z- and b - sites are found to be stable with the c - al distance 2.28 , 2.30 , and 2.25  , respectively .",
    "the corresponding binding energies are 1.70 , 1.54 and 1.60 ev , respectively.@xcite according to mulliken analysis , @xmath9  0.7e is transferred to the nanotube upon absorption of a single al atom and partially occupied electronic states occur in the band gap .",
    "while the binding energy of al is negligible on the graphite surface , the curvature of the @xmath0 tube provides significant binding interaction.@xcite    after having discussed the adsorption of a single al atom on a ( 8,0 ) nanotube , we next consider the adsorption of several al atoms where the al - al interactions play an important role .",
    "since the binding energy at the h - sites is the largest , we first consider a coverage where al atoms are placed at the h - sites .",
    "we start with a quarter coverage case ( i.e. @xmath10 ) by placing eight al atom at the h - sites around the circumference forming a ring in the double unit cell of the @xmath0 nanotube . according to this initial structure the al - al and c - al distances are 3.7 , and 2.4  , respectively . once this system ( consisting of 64 c and 8 al atoms ) is relaxed",
    ", we find that some al atoms move away from the nanotube surface towards their neighbors and eventually form a dimer as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dimer](a@xmath11b ) .",
    "we attribute this dimerization to the al - al interaction which is stronger than the al - nanotube interactions .        a uniform half coverage ( i.e. @xmath12 ) , where initially all h - sites are occupied by al atoms ( _ i.e. _ 32 c and 16 al atoms ) exhibits also instability . upon relaxation of this system ,",
    "al atoms tend to reduce the al - al distance from 3.0  to 2.5 - 2.8  , and at the same time they rise above the surface of the tube . at the end",
    "small and isolated clusters form on nanotube .",
    "some of the adatoms become completely disconnected from the surface to initiate a three dimensional ( 3d ) island growth , since the latter is energetically favorable with a binding energy @xmath13 ev .",
    "this situation as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dimer](c@xmath11d ) is in good agreement with the experimental observations.@xcite    above we showed that uniform al coverage on the h - sites did not yield a stable structure due to strong al - al interactions . however , if the al atoms are placed at the t - sites ( i.e. on the top of carbon atoms ) , the al - al distance no longer has to be large",
    ". therefore one can optimize the al - al and al - nanotube interactions simultaneously .",
    "below we demonstrate this situation for two special coverage cases , namely a zigzag al - nanoring and a al - nanotube around the @xmath0 swnt .     of the al ring along the tube axis .",

    "this structure includes 64 c and 16 al atoms in the double unit cell . in this initial configuration",
    "the al - al distance is 2.33  and the angle of al - al - al bond is @xmath9137@xmath17 .",
    "after structure optimization , the al - al bond length is increased to 2.56  , and the al - al - al bond angle is decreased to 124@xmath17 , yielding the radius of the nanoring to be 5.9  .",
    "a side view of the optimized structure of the al - nanoring wrapping the ( 8,0 ) swnt is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ring](a ) .",
    "the binding energy of the al nanoring is calculated to be @xmath18  ev . the stability of the al nanoring around the nanotube can be understood from the stable structures of planar al monoatomic chains .",
    "recent studies on the low dimensional structures of metals have revealed several stable atomic structures in one dimension ( 1d).@xcite the first - principles calculations predicted linear chain , planar zigzag , triangular , ladder and nonplanar dumbbell and pentagonal structures as stable structures for al wires.@xcite .",
    "more interestingly , it was found that by going from bulk to a chain structure the character of bonding in al wires changes and acquires directionality.@xcite among a number of these 1d stable structures of al predicted by first - principles calculations  @xcite was the planar zigzag monoatomic chain of al with a bond angle 139@xmath17 and bond distance 2.53   .",
    "this zigzag structure is only a local minimum on the born - oppenheimer surface , and hence its binding energy ( 1.92 ev ) is intermediate between the binding energies of bulk and linear structures .",
    "an energy barrier of @xmath90.1 ev prevents the transition from the planar zigzag structure to other relatively more stable 1d structures.@xcite the final optimized structure of the zigzag al nanoring around the ( 8,0 ) nanotube has structural parameters similar to this planar zigzag structure , except that it is rolled on a cylinder .",
    "the swnt initially serves as a template in the formation of the ring structure and also increases the stability of the ring by preventing the transitions to other relatively more stable structures .",
    "therefore , the al nanoring around the swnt is expected to be stable at room temperature .",
    "interestingly , the nanoring is also stable by itself , since the position of al atoms do not change significantly upon discarding the underlying carbon nanotube .",
    "we further analyzed the swnt - al nanoring interaction by studying the effect of the rigid displacement ( @xmath19 ) and rotation ( @xmath20 of the nanoring around the tube axis .",
    "the variation of the energy as a function of displacement , @xmath21-e_t[al+swnt]$ ] is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ring](b ) . here",
    "$ ] is the total energy of the unrelaxed tube - ring system with the ring displaced by @xmath19 .",
    "the highest energy configuration ( energetically least favorable ) corresponds to the situation where al atoms are close to the h - sites . for @xmath23",
    ", @xmath24 is 0.7  ev higher than the initial energy with optimized structure , @xmath25 , since no structure optimization was done at @xmath23 .",
    "the rigid rotation of the ring in the interval @xmath26 is also shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : ring](c ) .",
    "the highest energy configuration again corresponds to the case where al atoms are close to the h - sites ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ring](b ) ) .",
    "when the ring is aligned perfectly on the top of carbon atoms at @xmath16 , we obtain a saddle point .",
    "rotations by @xmath27 from the ideal configuration ( @xmath28 ) results in two stable configuration with a double minima potential separated by a barrier of 0.2  ev .",
    "the right minimum at @xmath15 corresponds to the starting optimized structure .",
    "the electronic properties of the zigzag al nanoring system described above ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ring](a ) ) is also quite interesting and may lead to new important applications .",
    "the electronic energy bands of the al metal ring ( without swnt ) are derived from the dispersive bands of the flat zigzag al chain.@xcite when the flat zigzag al chain is rolled into a ring , its bands are zone folded at the @xmath29-point and they appear as a number of discrete energy levels as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : band ] . for the case of the al nanoring wrapping the nanotube shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ring](a ) these states are mixed with the states of the nanotube and give rise to the bands and density of states shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : band ] . as a result of al - nanoring and ( 8,0 ) nanotube interaction ,",
    "the combined system is a metal .",
    "the small dispersion of the bands associated with the nanoring are due to the small interaction between the nanorings in the supercell .",
    "the dispersion of these bands is reduced with the increasing ring - ring distance and eventually becomes localized states of a single ring which dopes the empty conduction bands of the @xmath0 swnt . according to mulliken analysis 0.15",
    "electrons are transferred from each al atom to the swnt .",
    "most importantly , the al ring is a conductor that incorporates two channels with an ideal ballistic quantum conductance of @xmath30 .",
    "swnt ( middle panel ) .",
    "the total density of states is shown in the left panel .",
    "the right panel shows the energy levels of the bare al - nanoring .",
    "the zero of energy is taken at the fermi level . ]",
    "small radius of the metallic nanoring wrapping the carbon nanotube may lead to interesting electromagnetic properties due to its small radius .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath31 at the center of the ring can be expressed in terms of the quantized angular momentum @xmath32 of the electrons in the direction paralel to the tube axis : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the radius of the nanoring .",
    "taking the lowest possible value for @xmath32 and @xmath35  we estimate @xmath31 to be at the order of 100 gauss .",
    "the current in the metal ring that can induce such a high magnetic field is comparable to the current attained in the suspended , monoatomic gold chains.@xcite relatively higher magnetic fields at the order of tesla can be induced by higher current passing through a thick ti based metal coating around the swnt , or by increasing the number of turns and hence by forming a nanocoil . miyamoto _",
    "et al._@xcite have examined the chiral conductivity in bare bc@xmath36n nanotubes .",
    "they estimated that magnetic field of a few tenths of tesla can be induced at the center of the tube by assuming relaxation time of carriers @xmath950 times larger than that in cu and homogeneous chiral current density confined to the tubule wall .",
    "persistent currents in the nanoring can also start by sudden application of an external magnetic field . in this way it is possible to use a nanotube , with a ring at its end , as a local magnetic probe at nanoscale .",
    "a superconducting ring may also be used for schrdinger s cat experiments where one deals with superposition of macroscopic quantum states.@xcite the two supercurrent quantum states ( clockwise and counterclockwise flow ) sit in two separate quantum wells .",
    "it has been observed that a weak microwave , which does not break cooper pairs , can cause quantum tunneling between these two macroscopic states . in this kind of experiments",
    "the main problem is to isolate the superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) from the outside ( nonquantum ) environment and that is why isolated carbon nanotubes can be very useful .",
    "finally we discuss another stable uniform coverage which is obtained from sixteen al atoms placed at the alternating t - sites in one unit cell . upon relaxing this structure ,",
    "al atoms move towards the bridge sites so that the nearest neighbor distance is 2.7  ( which is close to that of the bulk al nearest neighbor distance , @xmath37  ) and the al - tube distance is 2.4  .",
    "the final , stable structure can be viewed as a tubular al ( i.e. al nanotube ) , the structure of which is matched to the swnt with a significant tube - al interaction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : altube ] ) .",
    "this structure is a metal with finite density of states at @xmath38 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : altube](c ) ) . to check whether the al nanotube is stable and can maintain its structure without the underlying swnt , we optimized the same structure without swnt .",
    "apart from decreasing the radius of metal nanotube , the geometric structure preserved .",
    "this indicates that the tubular al is stable by itself , and the interaction between swnt and al nanowire is not against the al - al stability .",
    "the density of states of the bare al nanowire without swnt indicates that the system is also a metal ( fig .",
    "[ fig : altube](d ) ) .    .",
    "in conclusion , we show that normally al atoms do not form a uniform metal coverage , but they rather tend to nucleate isolated clusters on the surface of swnt , in agreement with the experiments  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the al - al interaction is stronger than that of the al - swnt and for most of the decorations of al atoms on swnt these two interactions compete .",
    "however , we found two special al coverage , namely the swnt wrapped by the zigzag al ring and swnt covered by the uniform and concentric al nanotube . in these systems",
    "the al - al and al - nanotube interactions are not frustrated , which is the main reason for the stability . in both cases",
    "we find significant charge transfer from al to swnt , leading to metalization of the semiconducting tubes .",
    "al nanoring around a swnt is of particular interest because the states of the ring near the fermi level can carry ballistic current around the ring .",
    "we show that this can give rise to persistent current and/or high magnetic fields along the axis of the tube .",
    "clearly this is a very promising effect for many nano - devices applications , and provides new tools for experiments on fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics . in spite of the fact that al is highly air - sensitive and easily oxidized ,",
    "it is rather taken as a prototype element in the present study .",
    "we hope that this study will attract interest for further study to find other elements , which form stable but air - insensitive ring structures .",
    "we also point out technical difficulties in forming ring structures around a swnt . however , the recent advances in manipulating and relocating single atoms encourage us to explore the novel features of these nanostructures .                                              in ref [ ]",
    "the binding energy of a single al on the @xmath0 tube were calculated to be @xmath9 1 ev .",
    "this is value 0.7 ev smaller than the present results .",
