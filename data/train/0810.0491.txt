    "the santa barbara ( sb ) cluster model was introduced by frenk et al .",
    "@xcite in order to study in a systematic way a flat cold dark matter ( fcdm ) dominated universe using a variety of numerical codes .",
    "the main goal of this comparison was to asses the reliability of cosmological simulations of clusters in one of the simplest astrophysical relevant case .",
    "they compared the images and global properties of the cluster obtained by the different numerical codes .",
    "heitmann et al .",
    "( 2005 ) @xcite analyze again the cluster with others new numerical codes and with a similar purpose and now it has become one of the standard cases of study . given that this is a standard case to test we have decided to analyze it in the framework of the scalar - tensor theories ( sst ) of gravity .",
    "scalar fields have been considered as one of the best possible ways to modify gravity .",
    "the work by nordstrm , published before general relativity , formulated a conformally flat scalar theory of gravity @xcite , and finally , the scalar field role in gravity has been stablished since the pioneering work of jordan , brans , and dicke@xcite .",
    "nowadays they are considered as a mechanism for inflation@xcite ; the dark matter component of galaxies@xcite ; the quientessence field to explain dark energy in the universe@xcite .",
    "the main goal of this work is to study the large scale structure formation where the usual approach is that the evolution of the initial primordial fluctuation energy density fields evolve following newtonian mechanics in an expanding background@xcite .",
    "the force between particles are the standard newtonian gravitational force .",
    "now , we will see that we can introduce the scalar fields by adding a term in this force .",
    "this force will turn out to be of yukawa type with two parameters ( @xmath1 , @xmath2)@xcite .",
    "for so many years this kind of force , the so called fifth force , was thoroughly studied theoretically@xcite and many experiments were done to constrain the yukawa parameters@xcite .",
    "we have also been studying , in the past years , the effects of this kind of force on some astrophysical phenomena@xcite and in cosmological simulations@xcite .",
    "the yukawa force comes as a newtonian limit of a scalar - tensor theory with the scalar field non - minimally coupled to gravitation@xcite although other alternatives can be found@xcite .",
    "our general purpose is to find the role these scalar fields play on the large scale structure formation processes . in particular , in this work we present some results about the role scalar fields play on cosmological simulations that form the sb cluster .",
    "we start by discussing a fcdm model and the general approach in @xmath0-body simulations ( see bertschinger@xcite for details ) .",
    "then , we present the modifications we need to do to consider the effects of a static scalar field and we show the results of this theory for the fcdm model that form the santa barabara cluster @xcite . to perform the simulations we have modified a standard treecode",
    "the author has developed @xcite and the gadget 1 @xcite ( see also http://www.astro.inin.mx/mar ) in order to take into account the contribution of the yukawa potential .",
    "we finish this paper by discussing how we can obtain the equation of state for a dark matter halo in the framework of general relativity and its newtonian limit .",
    "the einstein equations for a typical scalar  tensor theory with a massive scalar field non - minimally coupled to the geometry are given by @xmath3 \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the scalar field equation @xmath4 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 is the metric , @xmath7 is the ricci s scalar , @xmath8 the ricci s tensor , @xmath9 is the energy - momentum tensor , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are arbitrary functions of the scalar field @xmath12 .",
    "we will not consider a cosmological constant contribution in this work .",
    "the study of large - scale formation in the universe is greatly simplified by the fact that a limiting approximation of general relativity , newtonian mechanics , applies in a region small compared to the hubble length @xmath13 ( @xmath14 mpc , where @xmath15 is the speed of light , @xmath16 km / s / mpc , is hubble s constant at this epoch and @xmath17 ) , and large compared to the schwarzschild radii of any collapsed objects .",
    "the rest of the universe affect the region only through a tidal field .",
    "the length scale @xmath18 is of the order of the largest scales currently accessible in cosmological observations and @xmath19 yr characterizes the evolutionary time scale of the universe .",
    "therefore we need to describe the stt theory in its newtonian approximation , that is , where gravity and the scalar fields are weak ( and time independent ) and velocities of dark matter particles are non - relativistic . we expect to have small deviations of the metric with respect to minkowski metric and of the scalar field around the background field , defined here as @xmath20 and can be understood as the scalar field beyond all matter .",
    "if one defines the perturbations @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the minkowski metric , the newtonian approximation gives @xcite @xmath24 we have set @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we are considering that the influence of dark matter is due to a boson field of mass @xmath27 governed by eq .",
    "( [ pares_eq_phibar ] ) , that is the modified helmholtz equation . equations ( [ pares_eq_h00 ] ) and ( [ pares_eq_phibar ] ) represent the newtonian limit of a stt with arbitrary potential @xmath11 and function @xmath10 that where taylor expanded around @xmath28 .",
    "the resulting equations are then distinguished by the constants @xmath29 ( the local gravitational constant ) , @xmath1 , and @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath31 is planck s constant .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ pares_eq_h00 ] ) can be cast as a poisson equation for @xmath32 , @xmath33    the next step is to find solutions for this new newtonian potential given a density profile , that is , to find the so  called potential  density pairs .",
    "general solutions to eqs .",
    "( [ pares_eq_phibar ] ) and ( [ pares_eq_psi ] ) can be found in terms of the corresponding green functions , and the new newtonian potential is ( see @xcite for details ) @xmath34 the first term of eq .",
    "( [ pares_eq_gralpsin ] ) , given by @xmath35 , is the contribution of the usual newtonian gravitation ( without scalar fields ) , while information about the scalar field is contained in the second term , that is , arising from the influence function determined by the modified helmholtz green function , where the coupling @xmath36 ) enters as part of a source factor .      to simulate cosmological systems , the expansion of the universe has to be taken into account",
    "also , to determine the nature of the cosmological model we need to determine the composition of the universe , i. e. , we need to give the values of @xmath37 for each component @xmath38 , taking into account in this way all forms of energy densities that exist at present .    if a particular kind of energy density is described by an equation of state of the form @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the pressure and @xmath41 is a constant , then the equation for energy conservation in an expanding background , @xmath42 , can be integrated to give @xmath43 .",
    "then , the friedmann equation for the expansion factor @xmath44 is written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 characterizes the geometry of the universe ( @xmath47 for a flat universe ) , and @xmath48 characterizes the equation of state of specie @xmath38 . here , @xmath49 , with @xmath50 .",
    "the most familiar forms of energy densities are those due to pressureless matter with @xmath51 ( that is , nonrelativistic matter with rest - mass - energy density @xmath52 dominating over the kinetic - energy density @xmath53 ) with @xmath54 and radiation with @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the density parameter contributed today by visible , nonrelativistic , baryonic matter in the universe is @xmath57 .",
    "there is also another main component , the energy density associated to a cosmological constant , @xmath58 with an equation of state such that @xmath59 . in this work",
    "we will consider a model with only one energy density contribution .",
    "one which is a pressureless and nonbaryonic dark matter with contribution given by @xmath60 that does not couple with radiation .",
    "the above equation for @xmath44 in this case becomes @xmath61    here , we employ a cosmological model with a static scalar field which is consistent with the newtonian limit given by eq .",
    "( [ pares_eq_gralpsin ] ) .",
    "thus , the scale factor , @xmath44 , is given by the following friedman model ( see a more general case in @xcite ) , @xmath62\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is the dark matter density evaluated at present , respectively .",
    "we notice that the source of the cosmic evolution is deviated by the term @xmath64 when compared to the standard friedman - lemaitre model .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to define a new dark matter density parameter by @xmath65 .",
    "this new density parameter is such that always @xmath66 , which implies a flat dark matter dominated universe , and this shall be assumed in our following computations . for positive values of @xmath1 , a flat cosmological model demands to have a factor @xmath67 more energetic content ( @xmath60 ) than in standard fcdm cosmology .",
    "on the other hand , for negative values of @xmath1 one needs a factor @xmath67 less @xmath60 to have a flat universe . to be consistent with the cmb spectrum and structure formation numerical experiments ,",
    "cosmological constraints must be applied on @xmath1 in order for it to be within the range @xmath68 @xcite .    in the newtonian limit of stt of gravity , the newtonian motion equation for a particle @xmath38",
    "is written as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the comovil coordinate , and the sum includes all periodic images of particle @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is @xmath73 which , for small distances compared to @xmath2 , is @xmath74 and , for long distances , is @xmath75 , as in newtonian physics .    we now analyze the general effect that the constant @xmath1 has on the dynamics .",
    "the role of @xmath1 in our approach is as follows . on one hand , to construct a flat model we have set the condition @xmath66 , which implies having @xmath67 times the energetic content of the standard fcdm model .",
    "this essentially means that we have an increment by a factor of @xmath67 times the amount of matter , for positive values of @xmath1 , or a reduction of the same factor for negative values of @xmath1 .",
    "increasing or reducing this amount of matter affects the matter term on the r.h.s . of the equation of motion ( [ eq_motion ] ) , but the amount affected cancels out with the term @xmath67 in the denominator of ( [ eq_motion ] ) stemming from the new newtonian potential . on the other hand , the factor @xmath76 augments ( diminishes ) for positive ( negative ) values of @xmath1 for small distances compared to @xmath2 , resulting in more ( less ) structure formation for positive ( negative ) values of @xmath1 compared to the fcdm model .",
    "for @xmath77 the dynamics is essentially newtonian .",
    "in this section , we present results of the cosmological simulations of a fcdm universe with and without sf contribution .",
    "the initial condition of the system corresponds to the well known _",
    "santa barbara cluster _ data that we get from the heitmann s cosmic data bank web page ( http://t8web.lanl.gov/people/heitmann/test3.html ) .",
    "the initial condition uses a box 64 mpc size , @xmath78 particles and start at redshift @xmath79 .    in 1999",
    "frenk et al .",
    "@xcite reported results of an extensive code comparison project involving twelve different codes .",
    "the aim of the project was to compare different techninques for simulating the formation of a cluster of galaxies ( by now widely known as the _",
    "santa barbara cluster _ ) in a flat cold dark matter universe and to decide if the results from different codes were consistent and reproducible .",
    "we have repeated this test but restricted ourselves only to the dark matter component of the test .",
    "the cosmological parameters used in the simulation are as follows .",
    "we used 128@xmath80 particles with initial positions and velocities with @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 km / s / mpc , box size = 32 mpc@xmath85 , @xmath86 for the present - day linear rms mass fluctuation in spherical top spheres of radius 16 mpc .",
    "the fcdm universe contents is given in units of the critical density , @xmath87 .",
    "the initial fluctuation spectrum was taken to have an asymptotic spectral index , @xmath88 , and the shape parameter @xmath89 , the value suggested by observations of large - scale structure @xcite .",
    "see @xcite and heitmann s web page above for full details . in the shown snaps at @xmath90 , fig .",
    "1 , the big cluster near the center of the frame is the sb cluster .",
    "the particle masses are @xmath91 m@xmath92 .",
    "the individual softening length was 50 kpc@xmath85 .",
    "these choices of softening length are consistent with the mass resolution set by the number of particles .",
    "we now present results for the fcdm model previously described .",
    "because the visible component is the smaller one and given our interest to test the consequences of including a sf contribution to the evolution equations , our model excludes gas particles , but all its mass has been added to the dark matter .",
    "we restrict the values of @xmath1 to the interval @xmath68 @xcite and use @xmath93 mpc@xmath85 , since this scale turns out to be an intermediate scale between the size of the clump groups and the separation of the formed groups .",

    "the effect is then , for a growing positive @xmath1 , to speed up the growth of perturbations , then of halos and then of clusters , whereas negative @xmath1 values ( @xmath102 ) tend to slow down the growth .    .",
