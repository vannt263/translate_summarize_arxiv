    "in this paper , we present the estimated abundances of elements produced by two distinct types of @xmath0-process events based on a phenomenological model for the production of the relevant nuclei .",
    "there are ongoing active investigations determining elemental abundances in very metal - poor stars with particular emphasis on the abundances of th and eu which are important for galactic chronometry ( cf .",
    "cowan et al .",
    "1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "these studies also address the question of the universality of the solar system `` @xmath0-process '' abundance pattern ( hereafter referred to as the solar @xmath0-pattern , cf .",
    "cowan et al .",
    "1995 , 1996 ; sneden et al .",
    "1994 , 1996 , 1998 , 1999 ; crawford et al .",
    "in particular , sneden et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1998 , 1999 ) have demonstrated that the abundances of elements in the pt peak ( at mass number @xmath10 ) and down to ba ( @xmath11 ) in cs 22892052 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath12 ) , hd 115444 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath13 ) , and hd 126238 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath14 ) are in remarkable accord with the solar @xmath0-pattern .",
    "it has generally been considered that the abundances of the @xmath0-process nuclei are due to a single generic type of events because the @xmath0-pattern observed in very metal - poor stars agrees so well with that of the solar system .",
    "two classes of @xmath0-process calculations have been carried out : both rely on theoretical studies of properties of very neutron - rich nuclei , but one uses simple parametrizations of the astrophysical environment ( e.g. , kratz et al",
    ". 1993 ) while the other has a detailed astrophysical context ( e.g. , meyer et al . 1992 ; takahashi , witti , & janka 1994 ; woosley et al .",
    "so far , no stellar model succeeds in generating the conditions required to produce the entire solar @xmath0-pattern ( witti , janka , & takahashi 1994 ; qian & woosley 1996 ; hoffman , woosley , & qian 1997 ; meyer & brown 1997 ; freiburghaus et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "however , it has been shown that the meteoritic data on the inventory of @xmath1i ( with a lifetime of @xmath15  yr ) and @xmath2hf ( @xmath16  yr ) in the early solar system require that the stellar sources responsible for these two nuclei be decoupled ( wasserburg , busso , & gallino 1996 , hereafter wbg96 ) .",
    "the nuclide @xmath1i is a pure @xmath0-process product ( cameron 1993 ) . as @xmath2hf",
    "can not be produced effectively by the @xmath17-process in asymptotic giant branch stars ( wasserburg et al .",
    "1994 ; busso , gallino , & wasserburg 1999 ) , the solar inventory of @xmath2hf must also have originated from an @xmath0-process .",
    "the meteoritic requirement for diverse @xmath0-process events can be seen from the following argument .",
    "let us first assume that there were only a single type of @xmath0-process events . with the recognition that both @xmath5i and @xmath1i must be produced concurrently and at about the same yields , the observed abundance ratio @xmath18 ( reynolds 1960 ; jeffrey & reynolds 1961",
    "; see brazzle et al .",
    "1999 for a recent summary ) at the time of solar system formation ( ssf ) then demands that the last injection of @xmath1i into the interstellar medium ( ism ) from which the solar nebula was formed had taken place @xmath19  yr earlier ( cf .",
    "schramm & wasserburg 1970 ) .",
    "this result can be obtained by considering two extreme cases for the @xmath0-process production history prior to ssf : ( 1 ) continuous uniform production ( cup , i.e. , with an infinitesimal interval between successive events ) with the last event occurring @xmath20 years before ssf , and ( 2 ) a single production ( sp ) event occurring @xmath21 years before ssf . in the cup case , we have @xmath22 , \\label{cup}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 represents the yield of the nuclide `` @xmath24 '' in a single event and @xmath25 is the period of uniform production . for @xmath26 and @xmath27  yr , equation ( [ cup ] ) gives @xmath28  yr . in the sp case , we have @xmath29 , \\label{sp}\\ ] ] which gives @xmath30  yr for @xmath26 .",
    "were there only a single type of @xmath0-process sources for both @xmath1i and @xmath2hf , the abundance ratio @xmath31 ( with the use of the solar @xmath0-process abundance of @xmath2w and the solar abundance of @xmath32hf given in table 1 ) would have decayed to values of @xmath33 ( sp ) to @xmath34 ( cup ) on the timescales deduced for the last injection of @xmath1i .",
    "such values are in clear conflict with the recently observed value of @xmath35 in meteorites ( harper & jacobsen 1996 ; lee & halliday 1995 , 1996 , 1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , the meteoritic data on @xmath1i and @xmath2hf require at least two distinct types of @xmath0-process events .    as the solar system abundances represent an average of galactic chemical evolution on larger scales , it is reasonable to generalize the implications of the meteoritic data discussed above to the larger - scale problem of the `` @xmath0-process . ''",
    "using this approach , wasserburg et al .",
    "( wbg96 ) concluded that there had to be at least two types of @xmath0-process events , one ( h ) occurring at a high frequency and one ( l ) at a low frequency .",
    "the recurrence timescale for the high frequency events was shown to be @xmath8 yr , commensurate with the timescale for replenishment of a typical molecular cloud with fresh type ii supernova ( hereafter referred to simply as supernova ) debris .",
    "they further pointed out that there should be distinct differences in the @xmath0-process abundance peaks in very metal - poor stars relative to the solar @xmath0-pattern .",
    "in particular , they inferred that there would be a dominance of the hypothesized high frequency supernova sources at early times with an abundance excess of the pt peak at @xmath10 relative to the @xmath36 peak below ba .",
    "qian , vogel & wasserburg ( 1998 , hereafter qvw98 ) have shown that in a two - component model to account for the solar @xmath0-pattern and accommodate the meteoritic data on @xmath1i and @xmath2hf at the same time , the nuclei between the peak at @xmath36 and the one at @xmath10 are always produced along with the latter peak .",
    "in addition , it is not readily possible to produce the @xmath36 peak without substantially populating the region beyond this peak , especially when @xmath37 capture on nuclei plays a significant role .",
    "they also found that the total mass yield of the low frequency supernova l sources responsible for the low mass peak at @xmath36 must be @xmath9 times that of the high frequency h sources mainly producing high mass nuclei beyond @xmath36 .",
    "they further speculated that the difference between the h and l sources was associated with the frequent formation of a black hole in supernova h events ( resulting in @xmath38 black holes with masses @xmath39 in the present galaxy ) and the less common production of a neutron star in the l events ( resulting in a present galactic inventory of @xmath40 neutron stars ) .",
    "as mentioned earlier , stellar abundances of elements associated with both the @xmath36 and 195 @xmath0-process peaks at very low metallicities are under active investigation ( e.g. , sneden et al . 1996 , 1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "a preliminary report made by cowan & sneden ( 1999 ) suggests that more than one type of @xmath0-process events may be required . for comparison with stellar observations , it is particularly useful to present specific quantitative inferences for the @xmath0-process elemental abundances in very metal - poor stars based on the meteoritic data discussed above",
    ". it will be shown that a two - component model has specific predictions for both the relative abundance patterns and the absolute abundances of @xmath0-process elements in stars formed from an ism seeded with the ejecta from an individual supernova . a criterion for such earliest formed stars",
    "will be given based on the eu abundance .",
    "it will further be argued that the @xmath0-process abundances in many very metal - poor stars are the result of many supernova contributions and that the `` metallicity '' [ fe / h ] can not provide a means of identifying the earliest formed stars .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 ,",
    "we show how the characteristics of a two - component @xmath0-process model , such as the fractions of @xmath5i and @xmath2w contributed by the h and l events to the total solar @xmath0-process abundances of these two nuclei , are determined by the abundance ratios @xmath41 and @xmath31 in meteorites .",
    "two scenarios for the uniform production of @xmath0-process nuclei relevant for the solar system abundances are discussed to provide bounds on the proposed model . in  3 , we determine the yields in the h and l events in our model from the solar @xmath0-process abundances by choosing the yield templates in the low and high mass regions based on the observed @xmath0-pattern in very metal - poor stars .",
    "we compare these predicted yields with the observed stellar abundances at very low metallicities in  4 and give our conclusions in  5 .",
    "appendix a contains more general discussion of a two - component @xmath0-process model , which emphasizes again the well - defined results from this model .",
    "in this paper , we will only consider addition of supernova debris to a `` standard '' mass of the ism ( see wbg96 and qvw98 ) without discussing the change in abundances due to astration that will store matter in stars over different timescales .",
    "we assume that the solar @xmath0-pattern is the result of two distinct types of supernovae that occur at different frequencies over a time @xmath25 in the galactic history preceding solar system formation ( ssf ) . with the relative supernova yield of @xmath42u to @xmath43u approximated by the ratio of the number of precursors for these two nuclei ( cf .",
    "fowler & hoyle 1960 ; fowler 1961 ) , the estimate of the abundance ratio @xmath44 based on a uniform rate of nucleosynthesis agrees very well with the observed value of @xmath45 ( e.g. , qian , vogel , & wasserburg 1999 ) .",
    "this applies for uniform production timescales @xmath46  yr , which are longer than the lifetime of @xmath43u ( @xmath47  yr ) and much longer than that of @xmath42u ( @xmath48  yr ) .",
    "if the actinide production rate is estimated to be of the form @xmath49 , we find that the rate changes only by a factor of @xmath50 over @xmath51  yr ( i.e. , @xmath52  yr ) in order to account for the observed value of @xmath44 .",
    "we thus adopt a model of uniform production ( cf .",
    "wbg96 ; qian et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "there are three issues involved in considering the early solar system abundance of short - lived nuclei derived from supernovae .",
    "these are the yield in a supernova , the dilution factor of the ism , and the time difference between the last supernova event and the formation of the solar system .",
    "we will discuss two scenarios , in which the last supernova event is either somewhat earlier than ( scenario a ) or coincident with ( scenario b , i.e. , a trigger for ) the formation of the solar system .",
    "these two scenarios are considered as bounds to the proposed model .      for simplicity ,",
    "let us choose a standard dilution factor for all supernovae ( cf .",
    "tsujimoto & shigeyama 1998 ; qian et al .",
    "1999 ) and focus on a specific volume of the ism corresponding to the standard mass diluting the debris from an individual supernova . over a time @xmath25 in the galactic history preceding ssf , supernovae in this `` volume '' can inject fresh nucleosynthesis products to give the abundances of radioactive nuclei in the early solar system and those of stable nuclei in the present solar system ( cf .",
    "wbg96 ; qvw98 ) .",
    "let us assume that a supernova @xmath0-process event regularly occurs every @xmath53 years in this volume with the last event taking place @xmath53 years prior to ssf ( scenario a ) . in this scenario",
    ", ssf occurs just before a new injection of @xmath0-process nuclei into the ism and @xmath53 years after the most recent injection .",
    "then for a short - lived nuclide `` @xmath54 '' with @xmath55 , the net number of @xmath54 nuclei present at the time of ssf is @xmath56,\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the number of @xmath54 nuclei produced per event ( i.e. , the yield ) and is assumed to be constant .",
    "note that for @xmath58 , we have @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the frequency .",
    "however , for @xmath61 , we have @xmath62 and the last event dominates at ssf . obviously , for a stable nuclide `` @xmath63 , '' the number of @xmath63 nuclei present at the time of ssf is @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the number of @xmath63 nuclei produced per event and should be about the same as the yield of the corresponding short - lived nuclide .",
    "we now turn to the case of two distinct @xmath0-process components .",
    "first consider the limiting case where the l events occurring at a frequency @xmath66 produce all of the @xmath1i and @xmath5i but no @xmath2hf , while the h events occurring at a frequency @xmath67 produce all of the @xmath2hf ( hence all of the @xmath0-process contribution to its stable daughter @xmath2w ) but no @xmath1i or @xmath5i .",
    "the meaning of l and h will become clear shortly . in this limiting case , we have @xmath68 and @xmath69 where @xmath70 stands for the @xmath0-process contribution to the solar inventory of @xmath2w . equations ( [ l0 ] ) and ( [ h0 ] ) can be reduced to the form @xmath71 and @xmath72 when we define @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 @xmath76 and @xmath77    both @xmath1i and @xmath5i are essentially pure @xmath0-process nuclei .",
    "as these two nuclei are so close in mass number , the relative yield @xmath78 in the l events must be close to unity .",
    "for clarity of presentation , we choose @xmath26 in the following discussion .",
    "however , we have checked that all of the results obtained in this paper are insensitive to variations of @xmath78 between 1 and 2 . on the scale of @xmath79 , the solar abundance of @xmath32hf",
    "is @xmath80 ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) and the solar @xmath0-process abundance of @xmath2w is @xmath81 ( kppeler et al .",

    "these and other data pertinent to our discussion are summarized in table 1 .    for the numerical values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 chosen above , the solutions to equations ( [ l1 ] ) and ( [ h1 ] ) give @xmath87  yr and @xmath88  yr . thus , l can be understood to stand for low frequency and h for high frequency @xmath0-process events .      in general",
    ", a two - component model does not require that the h events produce none of the low mass ( @xmath89 ) nuclei associated with @xmath5i or that the l events produce no high mass ( @xmath90 ) nuclei associated with @xmath2w .",
    "it only requires that the relative yields in these two mass regions be different ( cf .",

    "the @xmath0-process then dominantly produces nuclei in the high mass region with relatively few residual nuclei in the low mass region .",
    "these events are usually ( i.e. , at a high frequency ) terminated by collapse of the proto - neutron star into a black hole , as may be described by the scenario of brown & bethe ( 1994 ) . on occasion ( i.e. , at a low frequency ) ,",
    "collapse into a black hole does not occur and the ejection of matter for the @xmath0-process continues but with a lower neutron - to - seed ratio .",
    "the @xmath0-process then dominantly produces nuclei in the low mass region with significant yields also for nuclei in the high mass region .",
    "the total mass yield of @xmath0-process nuclei in the rare events is much higher due to the longer duration of mass ejection from the stable neutron star .",
