    "biological rotary motors , such as the f@xmath0 motor of atp ( adenosine triphosphate ) synthase and the bacterial flagellar motor ( bfm ) , convert energy of the transmembrane electrochemical potential into mechanical motion @xcite . the gradient of the electrochemical potential in the living cells is maintained by the metabolic mechanism that translocates ions ( here protons ) from the negative ( or cytoplasmic ) side of the membrane to its positive ( periplasmic ) side @xcite .",
    "a mechanical torque is generated when protons flow down the electrochemical gradient across the mitochondrial or cell membranes @xcite .",
    "bacteria employs this torque directly for chemotaxis @xcite , whereas in atp synthase the rotational energy is transmitted to the f@xmath1 motor mechanically linked to the f@xmath0 portion .",
    "the out - of - membrane component f@xmath1 contains three sites , which harness the energy of mechanical rotations to catalyze the synthesis of atp molecules . in the following , we concentrate on the f@xmath0 motor ,",
    "although our theoretical analysis can be applied to the bfm as well , since these motors have many common features .      the f@xmath0 motor is embedded into a plasma membrane of bacteria or into an inner mitochondrial membrane .",
    "it consists of two components : ( i ) a stator or subunit @xmath2 , tightly attached to the membrane , and ( ii ) a cylinder - shaped rotor ( subunit @xmath3 ) , which can freely rotate around its axis ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "in the majority of models @xcite the rotor contains several ( 10 to 15 ) proton - binding sites located in the middle of the membrane .",
    "the stator has two non - collinear half - channels , which are perpendicular to the plane of fig .  1 .",
    "each one of these channels are connected either to the periplasmic side of the membrane , having a higher electrochemical potential , or to the cytoplasm , characterized by a lower potential .",
    "the source ( @xmath4 ) half - channel delivers protons from the periplasm ( the positive , or , p - side of the membrane ) to the rotor - stator interface , and , finally , to the proton - binding sites in the rotor plane .",
    "the drain ( @xmath5 ) channel translocates protons from this interface to the cytoplasmic , or negative , n - side of the membrane .",
    "the rotor sites can be protonated or deprotonated when they are in the immediate vicinity of the source or drain channels . in atp",
    "synthase from _ escherichia coli _ the residues @xmath3asp-61 are equally placed along the rotating ring and serve as proton - binding sites carrying protons from the source to the drain channel @xcite .",
    "an empty rotor site has a negative charge .",
    "it is assumed @xcite that protons , delivered to the left side ( fig .  1 ) of the rotor - stator interface by the source channel , bind and neutralize the empty rotor sites , and after that , travel clockwise ( looking from the upper , periplasmic , side of the membrane , as shown in fig .",
    "notice that all rotor sites outside of the rotor - stator interface are occupied with protons and have no electric charge .",
    "the unprotonated negatively charged sites can not face the lipid core of the membrane because of a large ( @xmath6 500 mev ) desolvation penalty @xcite .",
    "the proton escapes from the rotor during the process of clockwise - directed rotor diffusion , when the corresponding site approaches the drain ( cytoplasmic ) channel located at the right side of the rotor - stator strip ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the negatively - charged empty site is not able to move back now because of the strong repulsion of the lipid medium .",
    "however , it can diffuse forward , in the clockwise ( cw ) direction , since there is no energy penalty for the charge placed inside the hydrophilic rotor - stator interface .",
    "the site is populated and neutralized again when it reaches the source channel at the left side of the interface , and the wheel can continue its cw rotation .",
    "because of random thermal forces , the rotor can also rotate in the counterclockwise ( ccw ) direction , and the populated site would then approach the drain channel . in the most probable event ,",
    "the site is depopulated and reflected from the lipid border of the rotor - stator interface . however , with a smaller probability , the neutral site , occupied with a proton , crosses the border , and the wheel rotates counterclockwise .",
    "when the population of the rotor sites occurs on the left side of the rotor - stator interface , and the depopulation happens on the right side , the rotor diffusion is biased to rotate cw .",
    "this means that the f@xmath0 motor works as a brownian ratchet @xcite .",
    "references  @xcite have shown , however , that the brownian ratchet model is not able to explain the operation of the f@xmath0 motor in the presence of an external torque ( about 41 pn nm ) , which is produced by the f@xmath1 motor and acts in the opposite ( ccw ) direction .",
    "in addition to two half - channels , the stator contains a positive charge ( a residue @xmath2arg-210 in _",
    "e.  coli _ ) which can be located between two proton - conducting half - channels in the rotor plane @xcite . as schematically shown in fig .",
    "1a , upon passing the source channel , the rotor site releases its proton and becomes negatively charged .",
    "this charge is attracted by the positive residue , thereby generating a torque moving the rotor in the cw direction ( power stroke component ) .",
    "reference  @xcite has demonstrated that the positive stator charge is necessary for the efficient reverse operation of atp synthase , when it works as a proton pump under the action of the external torque produced by atp hydrolysis .",
    "the irreplaceable role of the @xmath2arg-210 residue for the atp - driven pumping activity of the f@xmath0f@xmath1 complex in _",
    "e.  coli _ has been proven by direct mutagenesis studies @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that , despite the recent significant progress in understanding the operation of atp synthase , the physical mechanism of the torque generation and proton translocation by the f@xmath0 motor calls for further investigation @xcite .",
    "of special interest is the possibility to mimic the main features of this biological engine with the goal to create an artificial nanomachine with an almost perfect energy conversion .      here",
    "we explore a simple model incorporating the most important aspects of biomolecular rotary motors @xcite and employing a quantitative treatment based on methods of condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "these approaches have been previously applied to nano - electromechanical systems ( nems ) with their mechanical motion affecting the electrical properties of electronic devices @xcite .",
    "similar processes take place in nanoscale biological objects , where electrical and mechanical degrees of freedom are also strongly coupled , making them living counterparts to artificial nems .",
    "note that only nano - oscillators have been extensively studied by theorists , although a single - molecule rotor and nanoelectromechanical rotational actuators @xcite have been demonstrated experimentally . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "no theoretical investigations of rotary nems have been reported yet .",
    "it can be expected that artificial nanoengines built on the operating principles of biological motors could achieve the same level of efficiency and performance .",
    "atp synthase , along with many other enzymes @xcite , should be considered as a nonequilibrium open system whose operation is supported by a permanent flow of protons . to describe this flow",
    "we attach the f@xmath0 motor to two proton reservoirs related to the periplasmic ( positive , p ) side of the membrane and to the cytoplasmic ( negative , n ) side of the membrane . in the case of the respiratory chain @xcite , the p - side and the n - side correspond to the intermembrane space and to the matrix , respectively , divided by an inner mitochondrial membrane .",
    "usually the proton transfer between the rotor sites and the p and n aqueous sides of the membrane is represented by a set of markov equations with a phenomenologically constructed transition matrix @xcite . here , with the methods of quantum transport theory @xcite , we derive the rate equations and provide simple expressions for transition coefficients , which explicitly depend on the difference between electrochemical potentials of the proton reservoirs and on the distance between the proton - binding sites on the rotor and on the stator .",
    "this approach gives a clear physical picture of the loading and unloading events as well as the torque - generation process as a whole .",

    "these bonds are able to transfer protons within picoseconds either by collective tunneling @xcite , or , which is more probable , by classical hopping @xcite .",

    "it follows from fig .  3 that the power stroke component alone is not able to drive atp synthesis , because at the load conditions , @xmath73 = @xmath108 41 pn@xmath95 nm , and at @xmath51 = 4.2 k , the system operates in the _ shuttling mode _ , with a proton current but generating no unidirectional motion .",
    "notice also that despite the presence of a medium with high viscosity coefficient , @xmath67 = 1 pa@xmath95s = 1000@xmath161 , and despite the very small size , @xmath8 = 3 nm , the motor performs quite well and generates a significant torque at physiologically reasonable parameters .",
    "note that , because of the asymmetric configuration , this motor does not produce a unidirectional torque for a _ negative _ electrochemical potential difference @xmath162 , but it switches the direction of rotation if the drain channel ( see fig .",
    "1 ) is placed on the other side of the source channel ( at @xmath163 ) .",
    "this feature , as well as the nanoelectromechanical method as a whole , can be useful for explaining the _ switching _ ability of bacterial flagellar motors , which allows the chemotaxis of bacteria @xcite .",
    "we have examined a simple nanoelectromechanical model of a proton - driven rotary nanomotor which mimics the basic operating principles and the configuration of the f@xmath0-motor of atp synthase in bacterial and mitochondrial membranes .",
    "treating atp synthase as a nonequilibrium open system , coupled to two proton reservoirs , we have derived a set of rate equations , which describes the loading and unloading of the proton - binding sites on the rotor portion of the motor .    at normal conditions ,",
    "the isolated motor generates a torque of about 60 pn@xmath95 nm with efficiency near 80% , whereas the motor working against a constant load , created by the f@xmath1 portion , exhibits a unidirectional rotation ( fig .",
    "2 ) with frequency @xmath122 4 khz .",
    "it is shown that , depending on the temperature @xmath51 , the external torque @xmath73 , the proton voltage build - up v , and the energy @xmath107 of the rotor sites , the system operates in _ three _ different regimes : the _ torque - generating _ mode ; the _ shuttling _ regime ; and the _ pumping _ mode ( see fig .  3 and fig .",
    "4 ) .    in the _ torque - generating _ mode ,",
    "energy ( stored in the gradient of the proton electrochemical potential ) is converted into mechanical energy of the rotor .",
    "this energy transfer drives the unidirectional rotation of the motor , @xmath164 and the positive particle current , @xmath137 , corresponding to the downhill flow of protons from the periplasmic ( p ) to the cytoplasmic ( n ) side of the membrane .    in the _ shuttling _ regime , which takes place at low temperatures ,",
    "the rotor vibrates with a small amplitude near the initial point without performing a full circle . in doing so",
    ", the proton - binding site , located between the source and drain half - channels , works as a nanomechanical shuttle carrying protons from the p - side to the n - side of the membrane .",
    "this regime is distinguished by zero - frequency rotations , @xmath165 and by a positive proton current , @xmath137 .",
    "in the _ pumping _ mode @xcite , atp synthase operates in reverse , where atp hydrolysis drives rotations of the f@xmath1 motor .",
    "this external torque , @xmath73 , is transmitted to the f@xmath0 motor , which pumps protons uphill , from the n to p membrane side . in our case ,",
    "the ccw - directed external torque , @xmath73 = @xmath108 120 pn@xmath95 nm , is enough to translocate , in one millisecond , about 90 protons against the electrochemical gradient of 100 mev ( see fig .",
    "we have studied the performance of the model at different temperatures and found that this performance depends significantly on the coulomb interaction , @xmath166 , between the positive stator charge and the negatively charged empty rotor site .",
    "the torque produced by the brownian ratchet mechanism alone is not sufficient to overcome the load torque from the f@xmath1 motor .",
    "a key feature of the model is that , because of coulomb coupling to the stator charge , the energy of the proton on the rotor site , which is close to the source half - channel , @xmath110 , is _ higher _ , than the proton energy of the site located near the outlet of the drain channel , @xmath109 .    for positive proton voltage @xmath54 , when the electrochemical potential of the source , @xmath167 exceeds the potential of the drain , @xmath168 the rotor sites can be loaded with protons at the source and unloaded at the drain , if the energies @xmath110 and @xmath109 fit the transport window : @xmath169 this energy difference , @xmath170 is _ directly _ converted into mechanical energy .",
    "it is shown , however , that at low temperatures , when the brownian ratchet component is suppressed , the motor works in the shuttling mode , and no torque is generated .",
    "this means that , in agreement with previous results @xcite , the power stroke and the brownian ratchet components should work together for the efficient operation of the system .",
    "these conclusions can be applied both to biological rotary motors and to artificial nanoengines .",
    "notice also that an efficient and powerful future synthetic motor based on this bio - inspired design would be expected to withstand a more severe environment , in particular , much lower temperatures , than its biological counterparts .",
    "the present design can be compared with modern industrial electrical motors having an efficiency about 90% .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that this efficiency decreases drastically when decreasing the size of the motors .",
    "nano - scale motors operating in a warm and very viscous medium , even with an efficiency 80% , are worth building and studying as a function of various operating conditions .",
