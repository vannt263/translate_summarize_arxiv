    "increasing observational evidence supports a picture in which high - mass stars ( @xmath1 ) form through disk - mediated accretion , in a manner analogous to a scaled - up version of low - mass star formation ( e.g. , zhang et al . 1998 ; cesaroni 2002 ; beuther et al .",
    "2002 ; patel et al . 2005 ; beltrn et al . 2006 ) . however , the details of this process remain poorly understood . for example , rapid formation timescales ( @xmath2 years ) seem to necessitate extremely high mass accretion rates .",
    "meanwhile , strong radiation pressure from a high - mass yso is expected to impede accretion , and the lack of a strong stellar dynamo in high - mass protostars necessitates an alternative mechanism for shedding large amounts of angular momentum .",
    "although a number of theoretical studies have attempted to address these issues ( e.g. , mckee et al .",
    "2002 ; bonnell et al .",
    "2005 , krumholtz et al . 2005 ) , observations have been unable to readily distinguish between various models .",
    "open questions include : what are the sizes and structures of accretion disks around high - mass ysos ? what is the driving mechanism of their outflows ?",
    "what are the physical properties ( density , temperature ) of the disk - outflow interface ? what is the role of magnetic fields in high mass star formation ?",
    "one of the chief obstacles for constraining models of high - mass star formation is that examples of high - mass ysos tend to be relatively distant ( @xmath31  kpc ) , deeply embedded , and confused with other emission sources .",
    "moreover , since high - mass stars evolve rapidly , by the time an unobstructed view of the young star emerges , the disk and outflow structures may have been destroyed .",
    "consequently , observations to date have been unable to probe the 10 - 100  au spatial scales over which outflows from the accretion disks are expected to be launched and collimated .",
    "the kalypso ( kleinmann - low young proto - stellar object ) project ( http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/kalypso/ ) aims to overcome these limitations and provide the most detailed picture yet of a high - mass star in formation .",
    "the nearest region of high - mass star formation is the kleinmann - low ( kl ) nebula in orion , at a distance of @xmath0450  pc . within this nebula",
    "is located the radio continuum - emitting `` source  i '' , a luminous , highly embedded yso with a disk - like morphology ( reid et al .",
    "2007 ; figure  1 ) .",
    "the kalypso team has launched a multi - faceted study of source  i with unprecedented angular and temporal resolution .",
    "our goals include :    * chart the time - varying distribution of @xmath01000 sio maser spots within 10 - 100  au of source  i * measure proper motions of @xmath0100 individual sio masers with precision @xmath41  km s@xmath5 .",
    "* produce geometric and dynamical models of the molecular gas surrounding source  i * compare distributions of different maser transitions surrounding source  i to probe local density and temperature conditions * constrain the physical processes ( e.g. , shocks , collisions , fragmentation , magnetic fields ) that contribute to the process of forming a high - mass star * produce a movie documenting the 3-d evolution of the outflows surrounding a massive protostar over @xmath030% of the outflow crossing time",
    "observations of masers using very long baseline interferometry offer a powerful means to study massive star formation .",
    "masers are not affected by extinction , furnish information on the physical conditions of the emitting gas , and can supply kinematic information on the material surrounding ysos at extremely high angular resolutions .    using the vlba of the national radio astronomy observatory , we have obtained @xmath040 epochs of observations of the sio @xmath6 and @xmath7=2 masers toward source  i at one - month intervals over a multi - year period .",

    "the sio @xmath6 and @xmath12 observations described here are providing key new information linking the observations shown in figure  1 , and further solidify the picture of source  i as a high - mass star in the process of formation via disk - mediated accretion and outflow .",
