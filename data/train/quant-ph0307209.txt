    "<S> an interesting application of the present scheme is a coherent polarization rotator . </S>",

    "<S> if the injected field is left - hand circularly polarized , in the medium it will be transferred smoothly to the other mode and a right - hand circularly polarized light will exit the medium .    </S>",
    "<S> we note before closing that the process studied in this work is the spatial analog of stirap . </S>",
    "<S> that is , by using stirap in a @xmath0-type system complete population transfer from one state to another state is possible by proper choice of the rabi frequencies . in our method </S>",
    "<S> complete conversion from one laser pulse to another laser pulse is possible by proper choice of the initial spatial excitation of the medium . </S>",
