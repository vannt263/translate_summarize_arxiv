    "an accurate measurement of the primordial helium abundance would be an important test of standard big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite , and would also constrain the values of the photon - to - baryon ratio and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the traditional procedure to measure the primordial helium abundance is to make use of the correlation between the helium mass fraction ( @xmath4 ) and metal abundance ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "this correlation is then extrapolated to zero metallicity to estimate the primordial mass fraction of helium , @xmath6 .",
    "spectroscopic observations of bright , low - metallicity extragalactic hii regions provide the data for these studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to be cosmologically useful the value of @xmath6 has to be determined to better than 5%",
    "fortunately , abundance determinations from measurements of line ratios is relatively straightforward @xcite , and can , _ in theory _ , give the desired accuracy .",
    "however , to reach the needed level of precision , any systematic errors involved with target selection , observations , and data analysis must be identified and corrected .",
    "many such systematic errors have already been identified @xcite , but any errors resulting from the so - called `` ionization correction factor '' ( icf ) have so far been assumed to be small .",
    "the icf corrects for the fact that some amount of atomic ( i.e. , unseen ) helium might be present in ionized regions of hydrogen @xcite .",
    "this correction traditionally has been assumed to be zero because measurements of the primordial helium abundance employ observations of bright extragalactic hii regions .",
    "these regions are excited by clusters of young stars with effective temperatures greater than 40,000  k. calculations by @xcite and @xcite showed that the helium icf should be negligibly small for these hii regions . as a result ,",
    "recent determinations of @xmath6 have assumed that the helium icf is small .",
    "very recently , @xcite presented calculations that showed that hii regions excited by stars with temperatures greater than 40,000  k can have non - negligible icfs .",
    "@xcite found that the icfs were often negative ( i.e. , the helium ionized zone is * larger * than the hydrogen one ; @xcite , @xcite ) for the hardest stellar continua .",
    "these results were confirmed by @xcite . in this paper , we follow up on the work of @xcite , and develop observational diagnostics of when the he icf is important and when it can be ignored .",
    "we then apply these diagnostics to the data of @xcite to illustrate how our technique can improve the precision of the measurement of @xmath6 .",
    "we describe our calculations in   [ sec : calc ] , and our results in ",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "the main results are summarized in ",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "in order to investigate the effects of a non - negligible icf on the determination of the primordial helium abundance , we ran photoionization models of hii regions and extracted the icf for each nebula .",
    "these calculations are very similar to ones presented by @xcite and @xcite , and were made with the development version of cloudy , last described by @xcite .",
    "since we are modeling hii regions , our models use the ism abundances and grain model that were used and described by @xcite .",
    "however , we scaled both the metal and grain abundances to lower values because , in this case , we are most interested in lower metallicity nebulae .",
    "the scaling was implemented so that all metals and grains were varied together relative to hydrogen and helium , but the he / h ratio was held constant .",
    "we modeled nebulae at three different metallicities : o / h=32 , 64 , and 128 parts per million [ ppm ] ( @xmath7 , and @xmath8 respectively ) . for each metallicity ,",
    "1936 models were computed for each of the following spectral energy distributions : the lte plane - parallel atmospheres of @xcite , the non - lte , wind - blanketed , solar abundance costar atmospheres of @xcite , the earlier nlte atmospheres of @xcite , and for completeness blackbodies .",
    "we also ran models using the subsolar - abundance costar atmospheres which are spectrally slightly harder than the solar abundance ones .",
    "these models resulted in slightly more negative icfs , but the values of the line ratio cutoffs (   [ sub : zdep ] &   [ sub : zindep ] ) were not changed from the ones calculated with a solar abundance atmosphere .    for each atmosphere we computed models with 10  @xmath9  @xmath10 , 10@xmath11 , and 40,000  k@xmath12  k , where @xmath13 is the ionization parameter defined as in eq .  4 of @xcite .",
    "giant extragalactic hii regions that are observed are generally excited by large clusters , so this range of parameters should cover all such nebulae .",
    "we modeled the nebulae as plane - parallel constant density slabs , a simple way to characterize blister hii regions .",
    "our proposed diagnostic indicators are the [ o iii ]  @xmath05007 and [ o i ]  @xmath06300 lines (   [ sub : zdep ] &   [ sub : zindep ] ) , and these should be fairly independent of the assumed geometry ( sphere , sheet , or evaporating blister ) .",
    "the [ o iii ]  @xmath05007/h@xmath1 ratio represents the cooling per recombination ( the stoy ratio ) and so is primarily sensitive to the stellar temperature @xcite rather than geometry .",
    "similarly , the [ o i ]  @xmath06300/h@xmath1 intensity ratio mostly measures the `` softness '' of the hydrogen ionization front ( where the line forms - netzer & davidson 1979 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : temp - icf ] plots the icf calculated from the kurucz and costar models versus the stellar temperature . note that we define the icf such that an icf of zero corresponds to zero correction : @xmath14 where the angle brackets denote the volume mean ionization fraction .",
    "this definition takes into account the presence of any he@xmath15 in the nebula .",
    "figure  [ fig : temp - icf ] clearly shows that one can obtain a non - negligible icf for stars with temperatures greater than 40,000  k. the harder costar atmospheres give preferentially negative icfs , which , if not taken into account , would result in a overestimate of the helium abundance .",
    "the same is true of the mihalas atmospheres ( not shown ) .",
    "these results agree with the calculations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the softer kurucz atmospheres result in preferentially positive icfs ( i.e. , the helium ionized zone is smaller than the hydrogen one ) , although , at temperatures greater than 45,000  k , they can also give negative icfs .",
    "the blackbody atmospheres , the least realistic , are softer still , but even they can produce negative icfs in some models at the highest temperatures . therefore , negative icfs seem to be found at high stellar temperatures _ independent of the type of stellar atmosphere_.      a negative icf occurs as the results of penetrating high - energy photons preferentially ionizing helium , due to its large photoionization cross section .",
    "this tends to be important for lower ionization parameter models , since these have significant regions where h and he are partially ionized .",
    "we expect these nebula to be characterized by lower [ o iii ]  @xmath05007/h@xmath1 ratios ( a measure of excitation ) and larger [ o i ]  @xmath06300/h@xmath1 ratios ( since [ o i ]  @xmath06300 is formed in warm atomic regions ) .",
    "the results presented in   [ sub : temp ] show that it is not appropriate to simply assume that the icf is zero when a nebula is excited by a star with a temperature greater than 40,000  k. however , it would be important to develop observational diagnostics for when the icf is important and when it is not . figure  [ fig : o3-icf ] shows such a diagnostic . a plot of icf versus [ o iii ]  @xmath05007/h@xmath1 shows that beyond a line ratio of about 34 the icf is negligible ( for clarity results are shown for kurucz and costar atmospheres only ; a plot for blackbody and mihalas atmospheres is very similar ) .",
    "however , the value of the cutoff will depend on metallicity .",
    "we found very small icfs for line ratios greater than the following cutoff : @xmath16}\\ \\lambda 5007/\\mathrm{h}\\beta \\right ) _",
    "{ \\mathrm{cutoff } } = ( 0.025 \\pm 0.004)\\mathrm{o / h}+(1.139 \\pm 0.306),\\ ] ] where o / h is measured in parts per million .",
    "hii regions which have an [ o iii ]  @xmath05007/h@xmath1 ratio less than the cutoff for their metallicity might be subject to an icf correction .",
    "unless this correction can be made ( and , in general , it can not ) these hii regions should be removed from the abundance analysis , as they will increase the scatter in the @xmath17 relation used to determine the primordial helium abundance .      one can improve the above result by finding emission line ratios that should be independent of metallicity .",
    "figure  [ fig : o3o1-icf ] plots the helium icf versus the [ o iii ]  @xmath05007/[o i ]  @xmath06300 ratio .",
    "the figure shows that the icf is negligible for a line ratio greater than about 300 .",
    "not surprisingly , this result is _ independent of metallicity_.    there are some kurucz and blackbody models which result in a non - negligible icf at line ratios larger than this cutoff .",
    "these models had low stellar temperatures ( 40,00042,000  k ) , and were found over a narrow range in both @xmath18 ( @xmath19 to @xmath20 ) and @xmath21 ( 1.03.0 ) .",
    "their positive icf is a result of combining the low stellar temperatures and the softness of their atmospheres ; their large [ o iii ]  @xmath05007/[o i ]  @xmath06300 ratio is a result of combining the fairly high ionization parameter with the low density .",
    "costar and mihalas models , which are considered more `` realistic '' , result in only very small icfs in this region .",
    "therefore , we find that any hii region , regardless of its metallicity , that has an [ o iii ]  @xmath05007/[o i ]  @xmath06300 ratio less than about 300 might be subject to an icf correction and should not be used to determine the primordial helium abundance .      to see how these new results affect the determination of @xmath6 , we applied the metallicity independent rejection criteria to the data of @xcite , and the results are shown in figure  [ fig : o3o1-y ] .",
    "there are a number of points to note from this figure :    1 .",
    "our criterion rejects points over the entire range of metallicity , so there is no metallicity bias",
    ". the rejected points also fall evenly over the range of @xmath4 values , which implies that there is no correlation between @xmath4 and the [ o iii ]  @xmath05007/[o i ]  @xmath06300 ratio .",
    "2 .   at an [ o iii ]  @xmath05007/[o i ]  @xmath06300 cutoff of 300 there is a 20% reduction in the weighted rms scatter about the best fit line .",
    "this is encouraging evidence that part of the scatter was due to the icf , and the situation has indeed improved by the implementation of the cutoff .",
    "the negative slopes predicted by using a cutoff@xmath22 300 result from weighted fits to the small number of data that remain after applying the cutoff , and are probably not realistic . given the current data , a cutoff value greater than 300 is too severe ( not practical ) .",
    "4 .   despite the increased errors in the slope and the intercept",
    ", we find that implementing our cutoff will result in a larger value of @xmath6 .",
    "specifically , we find @xmath23 when the cutoff is taken at a [ o iii ]  @xmath05007/[o i ]  @xmath06300 ratio of 300 .",
    "@xcite find @xmath24 ( our fit gives @xmath25 with no cutoff ) , so the two results are barely consistent at the 1@xmath26 level .",
    "this result is in the opposite direction of the shift predicted by the monte carlo simulations of @xcite , but moves the value of @xmath6 closer to the theoretically predicted values @xcite .",
    "there is always the possibility that systematic errors are introduced whenever data are rejected by a certain criterion .",
    "the above selection criterion preferentially selects hii regions that have large [ o iii ]  @xmath05007/[o i ]  @xmath06300 ratios .",
    "this ratio is generally large whenever the [ o iii ]  @xmath05007 line is strong ( this is consistent with our metallicity dependent criterion ) .",
    "the [ o iii ]  @xmath05007 line is a major source of cooling in a nebula , and so by selecting hii regions with strong [ o iii ]  @xmath05007 lines we are selecting regions ionized by hotter stars .",
    "since these large extragalactic hii regions are generally ionized by clusters , ones with strong [ o iii ]  @xmath05007 lines are preferentially younger . however",
    ", this is unlikely to introduce a systematic error in the primordial helium abundance determination , as young clusters can form at any metallicity .",
    "indeed , figure  [ fig : o3o1-y ] shows that the points rejected by applying the cutoff span the entire range of metallicity .",
    "there is also the possibility that physical conditions within the hii regions may bias our results .",
    "for example , in some nebulae the intensity of the [ o i ]  @xmath06300 line could be enhanced due to shock heating .",
    "this would lower the measured [ o iii ]  @xmath05007/[o i ]  @xmath06300 ratio , and could move it below our selection criterion .",
    "however , shock heating would not change the icf of the nebula , so even though application of our criterion might reject such a hii region , it will not bias the determination of @xmath6 .",
    "another potential situation in hii regions is that the nebula may be matter bounded ( i.e. , optically thin to the lyman continuum ) in certain solid angles or sectors .",
    "because there will be no hydrogen ionization front in such sectors , and therefore no [ o i ]  @xmath06300 line emission , the presence of such sectors will increase the measured [ o iii ]  @xmath05007/[o i ]  @xmath06300 ratio , possibly pushing it above our selection criterion .",
    "however , these sectors will also have little or no neutral helium within them , and so will have no icf . therefore , although the other , ionization bounded , sectors of the hii region could have a non - negligible icf , this will be diluted by the matter bounded sectors .",
    "we anticipate that even if such an hii region were shifted into our selected data , there ought not be a large effect on determining @xmath6 . according to fig .",
    "[ fig : o3o1-icf ] , to severely bias the results a number of points would have to shift rightward in [ o iii ]  @xmath05007/[o i ]  @xmath06300 by a factor larger than ten ; but such a large shift in the line ratio would probably result in a large dilution in the icf .",
    "more modeling would be needed to quantify how little an impact matter bounded sectors would have on the [ o iii ]  @xmath05007/[o i ]  @xmath06300 ratio and icfs .",
    "in this paper we have shown the following :    1 .   there can be a non - negligible icf correction for hii regions excited by stars with temperatures greater than 40,000  k. at temperatures higher than 45,000  k , the icf is preferentially negative .",
    "this result is independent of the atmosphere of the o star .",
    "2 .   there is a simple procedure to determine if an icf correction needs to be made for a given hii region .",
    "if the [ o iii ]  @xmath05007/[o i ]  @xmath06300 ratio is greater than 300 , then no correction is needed .",
    "this criterion is independent of metallicity .",
    "if the [ o i ]  @xmath06300 line can not be measured , then there is a metallicity dependent cutoff ( eq .  [ eq : zcutoff ] ) that can be used with the [ o iii ]  @xmath05007 line .",
    "3 .   applying the metallicity independent criterion to the data of @xcite results in reducing the rms scatter about the best fit @xmath2 line by 20% .",
    "this will help remove systematic errors relating to unrecognized icf effects , and ought to improve the reliability of the @xmath6 determination .",
    "furthermore , an analysis of the selected data gives a larger value of @xmath6 than was originally measured , which is closer to the theoretically expected value .",
