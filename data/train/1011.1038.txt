    "the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking and the mechanism that generates the masses of the known fundamental particles is one of the central challenges of particle physics .",
    "the higgs mechanism  @xcite in its most general form can be used to explain the observed masses of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bosons as a consequence of three goldstone bosons ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) that end up as the longitudinal components of the massive gauge bosons .",
    "these goldstone bosons are generated by the underlying dynamics responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "however , the fundamental nature of this dynamics is still unknown .",
    "two broad classes of electroweak symmetry breaking mechanisms have been pursued theoretically . in one class of theories ,",
    "the electroweak symmetry breaking dynamics is weakly - coupled , while in the second class of theories the dynamics is strongly - coupled  @xcite .",
    "the electroweak symmetry breaking dynamics of the standard model ( sm ) employs a self - interacting complex doublet of scalar fields , which consists of four real degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "elementary scalar dynamics yields a non - zero scalar field vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , which leads to the breaking of the electroweak symmetry .",
    "consequently , three massless goldstone bosons are generated , while the fourth scalar degree of freedom that remains in the physical spectrum is the cp - even neutral higgs boson of the standard model .",
    "precision electroweak data favors a higgs mass below 200  gev , in which case the scalar self - interactions are weak  @xcite . in the weakly - coupled approach",
    "to electroweak symmetry breaking , the standard model is very likely embedded in a supersymmetric theory  @xcite in order to stabilize the large gap between the electroweak and the planck scales in a natural way  @xcite .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) employs two complex higgs doublets , resulting in five physical scalar degrees of freedom . in a large range of the mssm parameter space ,",
    "the properties of the lightest scalar of the mssm are nearly indistinguishable from those of the sm higgs boson .",
    "it is possible that the dynamics responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking is strongly - coupled  @xcite .",
    "precision electroweak data disfavors the simplest classes of models based on this approach .",
    "nevertheless , it remains possible that the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking is more complicated than suggested by the standard model or its supersymmetric extensions .",
    "however , in this talk i will not consider these theoretical alternatives nor their phenomenological consequences .",
    "in the standard model , the higgs mass is given by : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the higgs self - coupling parameter . since @xmath5 is unknown at present , the value of the standard model higgs mass is not predicted .",
    "in contrast , the higgs couplings to fermions [ bosons ] are predicted by the theory to be proportional to the corresponding particle masses [ squared - masses ] . in particular , the sm higgs boson is a cp - even scalar , and its couplings to gauge bosons , higgs bosons and fermions are given by : & & g_h f|f= , g_hvv = , g_hhvv = , [ hsmcouplings1 ] + & & g_hhh = v = , g_hhhh = = , [ hsmcouplings2 ] where @xmath6 or @xmath1 and @xmath7  gev . in higgs production and decay processes , the dominant mechanisms involve the coupling of the higgs boson to the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and/or the third generation quarks and leptons .",
    "note that a @xmath8 coupling ( @xmath9=gluon ) is induced by virtue of a one - loop graph in which the higgs boson couples dominantly to a virtual @xmath10 pair .",
    "likewise , a @xmath11 coupling is generated , although in this case the one - loop graph in which the higgs boson couples to a virtual @xmath12 pair is the dominant contribution .",
    "further details of the sm higgs boson properties are given in .",
    "reviews of the sm higgs properties and its phenomenology , with an emphasis on the impact of loop corrections to the higgs decay rates and cross - sections can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .      for an arbitrary higgs sector ,",
    "the tree - level @xmath13-parameter is given by  @xcite 0=1 ( 2t+1)^2 - 3y^2=1 , independently of the higgs vevs , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 specify the weak - isospin and the hypercharge of the higgs representation to which it belongs .",
    "@xmath15 is normalized such that the electric charge of the scalar field is @xmath16 .",
    "the simplest solutions are higgs singlets @xmath17 and hypercharge - one complex higgs doublets @xmath18 .",
    "thus , we shall consider non - minimal higgs sectors consisting of multiple higgs doublets ( and perhaps higgs singlets ) , but no higher higgs representations , to avoid the fine - tuning of higgs vevs .",
    "the two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) consists of two hypercharge - one scalar doublets . of the eight initial degrees of freedom ,",
    "three correspond to the goldstone bosons and five are physical : a charged higgs pair , @xmath19 and three neutral scalars .",
    "in contrast to the sm where the higgs - sector is cp - conserving , the most general 2hdm allows for higgs - mediated cp - violation ( see for a complete specification of the 2hdm tree - level interactions ) .",
    "if cp is conserved , the higgs spectrum contains two cp - even scalars , @xmath20 and @xmath21 and a cp - odd scalar  @xmath22 .",
    "thus , new features of the extended higgs sector include : ( i ) charged higgs bosons ; ( ii ) a cp - odd higgs boson ( if cp is conserved in the higgs sector ) ; ( iii ) possible higgs - mediated cp - violation and neutral higgs states of indefinite cp .",
    "more exotic higgs sectors allow for doubly - charged higgs bosons , etc .",
    "further details of extended higgs sectors can be found in .",
    "the higgs sector of the mssm is a 2hdm , whose yukawa couplings and higgs potential are constrained by supersymmetry ( susy ) . minimizing the higgs potential ,",
    "the neutral components of the higgs fields acquire vevs @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 .",
    "the ratio of the two vevs is an important parameter of the model , @xmath26 .",
    "the five physical higgs particles consist of a charged higgs pair @xmath19 , one cp - odd scalar @xmath22 , and two cp - even scalars @xmath20 , @xmath21 , obtained by diagonalizing the @xmath27 cp - even higgs squared - mass matrix .",
    "all tree - level higgs masses and couplings and the angle @xmath28 ( which parameterizes the diagonalization of the @xmath27 cp - even higgs squared - mass matrix ) can be expressed in terms of two higgs sector parameters , usually chosen to be @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for further details .    at tree level , @xmath31 , which is ruled out by lep data .",
    "but , this inequality receives quantum corrections .",
    "the tree - level higgs mass is shifted due to an incomplete cancellation of particles and their superpartners ( which would be an exact cancellation if supersymmetry were unbroken ) that contribute at one - loop to the higgs self - energy function .",
    "the higgs mass upper bound is then modified to  @xcite ^2 ^ 2 + 3g^2 m_t^48 ^ 2 ^ 2 , where @xmath32 governs stop mixing and @xmath33 is the average top - squark squared - mass .",
    "the state - of - the - art computation includes the full one - loop result , all the significant two - loop contributions , some of the leading three - loop terms , and renormalization - group improvements  @xcite .",
    "the final conclusion is that @xmath34  gev [ assuming that the top - squark mass is no heavier than about 2  tev ] .",
    "this upper bound is reached when @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the so - called _ maximal mixing scenario _ , which corresponds to choosing @xmath37 so that the predicted value of @xmath38 is maximal .",
