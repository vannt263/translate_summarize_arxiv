    "the absence of the space inversion symmetry results in a valley - dependent optical selection rule for interband transitions , which allows the realization of the valley polarization by optical pumping with circularly polarized light.@xcite space inversion symmetry breaking can also induce spin splitting of both the conduction and valence bands where the one of the valence band is much larger than that of the conduction band.@xcite this spin splitting is essential for spin physics and spintronic applications .",
