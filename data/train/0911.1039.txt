    "the relation between the flavor and mass eigenstates of the neutrinos can be described by the pmns matrix @xcite . in case of 3-neutrino mixing ,",
    "the parameters relevant to oscillations describing this matrix are three mixing angles , @xmath3 , @xmath4  and @xmath0 , and a cp - violating phase @xmath5 .",
    "the frequencies of oscillations between the different states are governed by the energy , distance and the two possible differences between the masses squared , @xmath6  and @xmath7 .    since the confirmation of neutrino oscillations a decade ago @xcite , great progress has been made in the measurements of these parameters .",
    "two of the mixing angles , @xmath3  and @xmath4 , and the size of the two mass splittings , @xmath6  and @xmath7 , are well measured ( for a recent combination of global data , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the most stringent limit on the third angle comes from the chooz reactor neutrino experiment @xcite : @xmath8 at @xmath9 . however , small contributions from various experiments add up to prefer a non - zero value of @xmath10 at the @xmath11 level @xcite .",
    "several experiments currently under construction will probe well into this region .",
    "those observing neutrinos at nuclear reactors will be covered in the next section .",
    "however , not all measurements fit clearly into the above picture .",
    "the lsnd experiment has observed an excess of @xmath12 events above background in the @xmath2 appearance search @xcite .",
    "the l / e value requires a mass splitting different than the solar and atmospheric @xmath13 to explain this effect with neutrino oscillations .",
    "three mass differences need mixing with a unobserved fourth type of neutrino with different mass , suggesting the existence of sterile neutrinos .",
    "the miniboone  experiment was designed to investigate this excess in detail , and will be covered in section  [ sec : miniboone ] .",
    "nuclear reactors are a pure and isotropic source of anti - electron neutrinos produced at a rate of about @xmath14 .",
    "the particles are produced through the decay of the fission products in the decay chain of predominantly @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17  and @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath19-spectra from the first three isotopes are measured to a precision of @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "these spectra are converted into a predicted neutrino spectrum resulting in a final error of @xmath21 depending on the energy .",
    "plans are underway to decrease this error significantly by measuring the @xmath18  @xmath19-spectrum and performing improved conversion calculations including more branches in the decay chain .",
    "the survival probability for anti - electron neutrinos is given by @xmath22 with @xmath23 measured in m , @xmath24 in @xmath25  and @xmath13 in @xmath26 . in case of a non - zero @xmath0 ,",
    "the first oscillation node is around 2  km for typical energies in nuclear reactor experiments .",
    "an observation of neutrino disappearance at this distance will constitute a clean measurement of @xmath27 : the last term containing the solar parameters can be neglected and the probability only depends on @xmath7 , a well measured quantity .",
    "the probability is not affected by matter effects due to the short distances and is insensitive to the cp - violating phase .",
    "several experiments have searched unsuccessfully for the disappearance of rector neutrinos at various distances due to a non - zero @xmath0 .",
    "the best limit was set by the chooz experiment to be @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "three experiments are currently under construction with a much improved sensitivity : double chooz , reno and daya bay",
    ". the statistical uncertainty will be lowered by building larger detectors , running for a longer time and by being located near more powerful reactors .",
    "the reduction in systematics uncertainty is mainly obtained by placing one or more identical detectors close to the reactor cores .",
    "a ratio measurement will eliminate the cross section , the neutrino flux and some detector uncertainties .",
    "there is also a gain from an improved detector design with lower thresholds , increased efficiencies and implementation of a very detailed calibration program .",
    "further enhancements are obtained by lowering the background contamination with better veto systems , shielding , higher overburden and the use of materials with improved radio - purity .",
    "the anti - electron neutrinos are measured through the inverse @xmath19-decay process @xmath29 , with a threshold energy of 1.8 @xmath25 .",
    "folding the neutrino flux from the reactor with the cross section results in an observable spectrum peaking just below 4  @xmath25 .",
    "the three experiments employ similar detector designs with three regions containing different types of liquids , separated by optically transparent acrylic vessels .",
    "the central region is filled with liquid scintillator doped with a small amount of gadolinium , typical @xmath30 in weight .",
    "the produced positron annihilates instantly and deposits a total amount of visible energy closely related to the neutrino energy : @xmath31 .",
    "the neutron slows down through thermalization before being captured by a nucleus .",
    "this will most often happen on gadolimium due to its high cross section for neutron capture .",
    "the typical capture time is @xmath32 and releases a total amount of energy around 8  @xmath25  in the form of several gammas .",
    "the target region is surrounded by the gamma catcher : a volume with undoped scintillator to capture any gamma escaping the target .",
    "the outside region contains the photo - multiplier tubes ( pmt ) and is filled with non - scintillating oil .",
    "this design suppresses a large fraction of the radioactivity coming from the pmts and surrounding material .",
    "the detectors are also surrounded by active veto detectors and passive shielding to further suppress natural radioactivity and backgrounds related to cosmic muon interactions .",
    "the typical signature of a prompt signal plus a delayed energy deposit consistent with neutron capture on gadolinium is used to select neutrino candidates .",
    "the background events can be categorized into two classes .",
    "the accidental backgrounds consist of a positron - like signal from natural radioactivity present in the pmts , the detector materials and the surrounding rock , followed close in time by an independent neutron - like signal .",
    "these can be actual neutrons generated by cosmic muons interacting in the material surrounding the detector , or high energy gammas mimicking a neutron capture on gadolinium .",
    "the correlated backgrounds are produced by one single event with multiple energy deposits .",
    "a fast neutron produced by cosmic muons slows down by recoiling on the protons in the scintillator producing electron - like signals until it gets captured by the gadolinium .",
    "other sources are long lived isotopes produced in high energetic showering cosmic muon interactions undergoing a @xmath19-n decay .",
    "the isotopes have typical livetimes of @xmath33 and are impossible to eliminate by vetoing every cosmic muon .",
