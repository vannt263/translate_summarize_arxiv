    "core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) result from the death of a massive star that has exhausted its nuclear fuel , and can no longer resist gravitational collapse . despite this common explanation ,",
    "ccsne show considerable observational diversity , resulting from the structure and composition of the progenitor star immediately prior to collapse ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the observed properties of ccsne are also influenced by their environments ; the specific subclass of events , dubbed type iin sne , are defined by the interaction between the sn ejecta and a surrounding region of dense circumstellar material ( csm ) which typically gives rise to narrow ( few @xmath3100s ) balmer emission lines @xcite . in many cases",
    ", the luminosity of type iin sne can be enhanced many times over that of a normal core - collapse event due to the transfer of some fraction of the kinetic energy from the sn ejecta as it collides with the csm .",
    "given that mass loss is a key driver of massive star evolution , the most likely origin of the dense circumstellar material close to the sn would be from the progenitor star .",
    "this temporal coincidence suggests that the mass loss may be linked to the final evolutionary stages of the star , although the detailed physics of this process remains elusive .",
    "some type iin sne have been linked to very massive luminous blue variable ( lbv ) stars ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are known to experience very high mass loss rates @xcite .",
    "this poses a challenge for the current paradigm of stellar evolution theory , which would not lead us to expect lbvs to be the direct antecedent of ccsne @xcite .",
    "another intriguing connection is with the so - called sn impostors @xcite .",
    "sn impostors are observationally similar to type iin sne , but the substantial difference in peak brightness compared to a _ bona fide _ ccsn , means that they are commonly thought to be ( giant ) eruptions of a massive star , where up to a few  of material can be ejected by the star , but _ without undergoing core - collapse _ ( e.g * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the recent sn  2009ip @xcite has further complicated this picture , with a three year long series of outbursts , that culminated in an event which some authors have claimed is the star exploding as a ccsn , and others have suggested may be an extreme non - terminal eruption @xcite .",
    "similar controversy also surrounds the fate of sn 1961v @xcite . aside from these debated transients , only two other sne",
    "have purported eruptions prior to their final core - collapse ; the type ibn sn 2006jc @xcite and the type iin sn 2010mc @xcite .",
    "it is clear that a critical aspect of understanding type iin sne is to identify and characterize the eruptions and outbursts which eject material into the csm prior to the final core - collapse . to this end , we present in this letter an analysis of the eruptive history of the type iin sn 2011ht , using serendipitous archival imaging taken prior to its discovery on 29 september 2011 ( mjd 55833.68 ) .",
    "when sn 2011ht was first discovered @xcite , it was initially classified as a sn impostor @xcite .",
    "however , the transient reached a peak absolute magnitude of @xmath4 - 17 , and @xcite later claimed that it was in fact a type iin sn .",
    "the ambiguity as to the nature of sn 2011ht has continued , with @xcite concluding that sn 2011ht had features reminiscent of both type iin sne and sn impostors , although the observed uv emission had not been seen in a sn impostor before .",
    "subsequently , @xcite argued that sn 2011ht was _ not _ a ccsn , based on velocities , and estimates of energy and ejected mass .",
    "most recently , @xcite presented late time ( + 147 d ) spectra of sn 2011ht with weak nebular [ o  ii ] emission ; this indicator of nucleosynthetic processing favours a core - collapse interpretation .    in what follows ,",
    "we adopt a kinematic distance of 19.2 mpc towards ugc 5460 , and a foreground extinction of @xmath5=0.025 @xcite .",
    "the explosion epoch of sn 2011ht is uncertain , but is probably close to the discovery epoch based on the rising lightcurve and uv magnitudes .",
    "we therefore adopt the discovery epoch , 2011 sept .",

    "the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system 1 ( pan - starrs1 ; henceforth abbreviated to ps1 ) is a wide - field , panchromatic survey telescope located on haleakala in hawaii @xcite . as part of the `` 3@xmath7 survey ''",
    ", ps1 observes the entire visible night sky on a rolling basis in @xmath8@xmath9@xmath10@xmath0@xmath1  filters @xcite .",
    "these images typically reach a limiting magnitude of @xmath320 - 21 mag , and hence are sufficiently deep to detect relatively faint precursor outbursts of nearby sne . in the 3@xmath7 survey ,",
    "two exposures separated by @xmath330 min ( termed a `` transient time interval ( tti ) pair '' ) are taken with the same filter and at an identical pointing for each epoch / visit ; this permits the removal of moving objects and cosmic ray hits .",
    "the images are reduced by the image processing pipeline ( ipp ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which detrends the data , performs astrometric and photometric calibration , stacks and template - subtracts images , and finally , performs source detection and photometry of all objects in the field .",
    "we examined all available ps1 images of the site of sn 2011ht , from the earliest image taken in feb 2010 until the most recent image from april 2013 .",
    "a source was visible at the sn position in several frames ; and for each of these we list the magnitude determined using point spread function ( psf ) fitting photometry as implemented in ipp , in table [ table_phot ] . in all cases ,",
    "the source was visible in both frames taken as part of the tti pair .",
    "these magnitudes are in the ps1 photometric system as described in @xcite , which is comparable to the sdss photometric system for _ z_-band ( @xmath11_z_@xmath12-_z@xmath13_@xmath140.05 mag ) .",
    "we additionally checked the ipp photometry for the _ z_-band detection using independent psf - fitting routines within the iraf environment ; a photometric zeropoint for each image was determined from aperture photometry of nearby sources with catalogued sdss dr6 @xcite magnitudes .",
    "uncertainties were estimated using artificial star tests near the sn location , and added in quadrature with the uncertainty in the zeropoint .",
    "we found that both methods yielded magnitudes consistent to within 0.06 mag . for frames where a source was not visible at the position of sn 2011ht , we estimated a limiting magnitude ( typically @xmath152021 ) by adding progressively fainter artificial sources to the image , using a psf built from nearby point sources .",
    "the limiting magnitude was taken to be that of the faintest artificial source which could be clearly identified by visual inspection at the position of sn 2011ht .",
    "we note that this is a conservative approach ; photometry on the faintest recovered artificial sources has a typical error of @xmath30.1 mag , corresponding to a @xmath16 detection .",

    "the ne and o burning timescales for a massive star are on the order of months to a few years @xcite , and @xcite has proposed that ne flashes in 8 - 10  progenitors could be a viable candidate mechanism . in this scenario , a temperature inversion develops in the semi - degenerate core of a star , due to the neutrino losses which are highest in the very centre .",
    "this temperature inversion can lead to off - centre ne ignition @xcite . as the core",
    "is partially supported by electron degeneracy , the ne burning front which propagates inwards is unstable , and can give rise to explosive burning and possibly an ejection of part of the stellar envelope . however , in the models of @xcite this phenomenon occurs in only a small mass range , corresponding to a helium core of between 2.8 - 3.0 . furthermore , and as noted by @xcite , this behaviour has not been probed with more modern codes , and hence it is uncertain if ne flashes do in fact drive significant eruptions .",
    "there are probably too many type iin sne to all come from massive lbv - like progenitors @xcite . indeed , given the heterogeneity of the class , it would seem natural to expect a similarly diverse range of progenitors .",
    "sn 2011ht has some similarity to sne 1994w and 2009kn @xcite , most notably an initial @xmath3120 d period of approximately constant luminosity , followed by a sudden drop of several magnitudes onto a tail phase , which led @xcite to propose these as a subclass of `` type iin - p '' sne .",
    "based on this , the faint tail , @xcite suggested that these objects come from either low mass ( 8 - 10 ) progenitors with a weak explosion and low ejected @xmath20ni mass , or higher mass progenitors with fallback .",
    "the `` plateau '' in these objects is , however , perhaps distinct from the plateau in normal type iip sne , as it is unclear whether they are dominated by the recombination of a h envelope @xcite .",
    "pso j152.0441 + 51.8492 provides the first evidence that , if they are indeed genuine core - collapse sne , then at least one of this class of objects had an outburst @xmath191 year prior to explosion .",
    "integrating under the light curve of pso j152.0441 + 51.8492 gives a total energy of @xmath21 erg .",
    "this is admittedly only a crude estimate given the limited wavelength coverage of our data _ grizy _ , and that we implicitly assume that the colour of pso j152.0441 + 51.8492 remained constant over the duration of the outburst .",
    "the true value is likely to be considerably higher .",
    "nonetheless , for a characteristic csm velocity of 600 - 700  @xcite , this corresponds to the kinetic energy of only 2@xmath22  of ejecta .",
    "it is unclear whether such a small mass could provide a sufficiently dense csm for strong interaction to occur one year later .",
    "this mass is also considerably lower than the @xmath30.5   of material ejected 1.5 yr prior to explosion which @xcite proposed could explain the lightcurve of sn 1994w .",
    "however , we again stress that the energy budget and variability history of pso j152.0441 + 51.8492 are not well constrained , and hence the estimated mass could well be significantly higher .",
    "the faint , and perhaps red , nature of pso j152.0441 + 51.8492 provides a tantalising hint that such outbursts may well be associated with other type iin sne .",
    "pso j152.0441 + 51.8492 was much fainter than both the first observed outburst of sn 2010mc , and the `` 2012a '' eruption of sn 2009ip , but similar in magnitude to the earlier 2009 - 2011 eruptions of the latter .",

    "<S> unfiltered , archival catalina real time transient survey images also reveal a coincident source from at least 258 to 138 days before the main event . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the outburst is likely to be an intrinsically red eruption , although we can not conclusively exclude a series of erratic outbursts which were observed only in the redder bands by chance . </S>",
    "<S> this is only the fourth detection of an outburst prior to a claimed sn , and lends credence to the possibility that many more interacting transients have pre - explosion outbursts , which have been missed by current surveys . </S>"
