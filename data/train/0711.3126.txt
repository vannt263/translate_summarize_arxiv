    "the nature of scalar states , under debate since over 30 years , represents one of the major problems of low energy qcd , see @xcite for reviews . in these proceeding , based on the works @xcite , the tetraquark hypothesis for the light scalar mesons",
    "is discussed .",
    "the resonances @xmath0 @xmath1 and @xmath2 are well established @xcite and evidence for the state @xmath3 although not yet decisive , is mounting .",
    "thus , a full nonet emerges below 1 gev .",
    "why not to interpret it as a quarkonium scalar nonet ? some serious problems are well known : ( a ) the mass degeneracy of @xmath4 and @xmath1 , which would be @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the @xmath7 assignment , is unexplained .",
    "( b ) the coupling of @xmath8 to @xmath9 is large and points to a hidden s - quark component .",
    "( c ) scalar quarkonia are p - wave ( and spin 1 ) states , therefore expected to lie above 1 gev as the tensor and axial - vector mesons .",
    "( d ) quenched lattice results @xcite find a quarkonium isospin 1 mass @xmath10-@xmath11 gev , thus showing that @xmath12 rather than @xmath8 , is the lowest scalar @xmath13 quarkonium ; recent unquenched results of ref .",
    "@xcite which find in addition to @xmath14 also @xmath8 , are discussed in the conclusions .",
    "( e ) in the large-@xmath15 study of ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that the resonance @xmath2 does @xmath16 behave as a quarkonium or a glueball state : the width does not scale as @xmath17 and the mass is not constant .",
    "these problems can be solved in the framework of the tetraquark assignment of the light scalars : as shown by jaffe 30 years ago @xcite , when composing scalar diquarks in the color and flavor antitriplet configuration ( good diquarks ) instead of quarks , the resonance @xmath1 is dominantly @xmath18  and the neutral isovector @xmath8 as @xmath19 , thus neatly explaining the problem ( a ) mentioned above .",
    "the @xmath2 is the lightest state with dominant contribution of @xmath20 , in between one has the kaonic state @xmath21 ( @xmath22 interpreted as @xmath23 ) : the mass pattern is nicely reproduced .",
    "this is still one of the most appealing properties of the tetraquark assignment .",
    "support for the existence of jaffe s states below 1 gev is also in agreement with the lattice studies of refs .",
    "@xcite . concerning the other problems mentioned above : ( b )",
    "is solved because @xmath8 has a hidden s - quark content .",
    "points ( c ) and ( d ) are solved setting the quarkonia states above 1 gev : @xmath14 and @xmath24 are the isovector and isodoublet respectively , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the isoscalar states with glueball s intrusion ( with @xmath26 being a hot candidate ) @xcite .",
    "point ( e ) is solved in virtue of the large-@xmath15 counting for tetraquarks : widths and masses increase for increasing @xmath15 @xcite .    in the following we concentrate on quantitative aspects of the tetraquark assignment : in section 2 the clebsch - gordan coefficients for the strong decays are studied , in section 3 the inclusion of mixing with quarkonia states is investigated within a chiral approach ; subsequently , the inclusion of mesonic loops and finite - width effects is analyzed .",
    "finally , in section 4 the conclusions are presented .",
    "in the original work of jaffe @xcite the decay of tetraquark states takes place via the so - called superallowed ozi - mechanism ( fig .",
    "1.a ) : the switch of a quark and an antiquark generates the fall - apart of the tetraquark into two mesons .",
    "this mechanism is dominant in the large-@xmath15 counting .",
    "already in @xcite the possibility that a quark and an antiquark annihilate is mentioned in relation to isoscalar mixing but is not explicitly evaluated for the decay rates .",
    "the fact that only one intermediate transverse gluon is present , see fig .",
    "1.b , may indicate that this mechanism , although suppressed of a factor @xmath17 , is relevant .",
    "in @xcite the discussion of strong decays of tetraquarks is revisited .",
    "mechanism of fig .",
    "1.b is mentioned in the end of the work but is not systematically evaluated for all decay modes .",
    "this has been the motivation of @xcite , where the inclusions of both decay modes of fig .",

    "although all these effects are important and deserve further study such as the inclusion of derivative coupling and @xmath8-@xmath1 mixing effects @xcite , the scenario as outlined in section 1 is not qualitatively modified : clebsch - gordan coefficients of tree - level amplitudes offer a way to distinguish among different spectroscopic interpretations of the light scalars .",

    "noticeably , one does not need to specify the form of the chiral lagrangian : the requirement of chiral symmetry breaking , together with the experimental information on decay widths from @xcite , is sufficient to find upper limits for the mixing angles .",
    "( b ) mesonic loops and finite - width effects represent an important extension beyond tree - level @xcite allowing the evaluation @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "both extensions ( a ) and ( b ) do not change the qualitative picture emerging in section 2 .    as mentioned in the introduction in the recent unquenched calculation of @xcite",
    "the @xmath14 is still present , but a lower state , compatible with @xmath8 shows up : however , unquenched lattice calculations @xmath113 include quark loops and therefore induce also tetraquark admixtures .",
    "indeed , in the ideal limit lattice simulations should reproduce the physical states regardless of their inner structure . in this sense",
    "quenched simulations might be more suitable to answer the question related to the bare quarkonia states : for this reason we still consider valid the results of @xcite , according to which the bare isovector quarkonium lies in the @xmath11 gev mass region .    the two - photon mechanism has not been discussed here but will be subject of a forthcoming proceeding , see however @xcite and the recent work sgg .",
    "future theoretical studies aiming to understand the nature of light scalars will focus on the following subjects :  ( i ) the radiative decay of @xmath57 meson ( @xmath114 , in particular concerning the line shapes @xcite .",
    "( ii ) predictions for scalar decays into a vector meson and a photon ( @xmath115 @xcite .",
