    "there is no doubt that at least one form of galactic wind exists : starburst galaxies are commonly observed to host supernova - driven galactic - scale winds @xcite in both the local and high redshift universe @xcite .",
    "these superwinds are phenomenologically complex and are comprised of multiple different gas phases moving at different velocities @xcite .",
    "however , the very hot plasma long hypothesized to be the prime mover in superwinds @xcite , often called the wind fluid , has only recently been directly observed in the archetypal superwind associated with the starburst galaxy m82 @xcite .    the most fundamental long - standing uncertainty in our understanding of the nature of superwinds and their larger scale role is the value of the energy per particle of the metal - enriched wind - fluid that drives an individual superwind . both supernovae ( sne ) and",
    "stellar winds from massive stars are responsible for supplying the kinetic energy that drive superwinds ( stellar winds only contribute @xmath13% of the total mechanical power of a starburst , but they may supply up to half of the gas mass returned to the ism , see @xcite ) .",
    "what fraction of the @xmath14 of kinetic energy released per star that ultimately goes supernova is actually available to drive bulk motions of the ism ?",
    "as it is understood that sne dominate the energy return this is often termed the sn thermalization efficiency or the sn feedback efficiency , even though stellar winds do play some small part energetically .",
    "is the metal - enriched mix of sn and stellar wind ejecta diluted and cooled by mixing with the ambient ism , i.e.  is the wind - fluid mass - loaded",
    "? if this ejecta is to escape the galaxy and enter the igm then its specific energy must exceed its initial gravitational potential energy , and furthermore the total energy in the wind - fluid must be sufficient to perform the mechanical work necessary to move the interstellar and halo gas that lies between the starburst region and the igm @xcite .    for moderate to high thermalization efficiency ( efficiencies @xmath15 10% ) , the wind - fluid is expected to have an initial temperature within the starburst region in the range 10  100 million kelvin @xcite , even if it has been lightly mass - loaded with cold ambient gas .",
    "such temperatures are far hotter than the neutral , warm ionized or soft x - ray emitting plasmas that are the most easily observed phases within superwinds @xcite .",
    "however it has only recently become technically possible to detect the diffuse hard x - ray emission that would be associated with a plasma in the temperature range @xmath16 ( k ) @xmath17 .",
    "the starburst regions of even the nearest starburst galaxies only subtend @xmath18 ",

    "it is important to distinguish between the material that actually drives a superwind , and the other more easily observed phases of swept - up and entrained gas that are part of the wind .",
    "we define the wind - fluid as the material whose high thermal and/or ram pressure drives the superwind .",
    "the wind fluid certainly comprises a significant fraction of the merged sn ejecta and massive star stellar wind material , probably admixed ( mass - loaded ) with some ambient gas from with starburst region .",
    "although other gas phases may dominate the total gas mass budget of a superwind , they are less important with respect to the issue of energy and metal transfer into the igm .",
    "furthermore the ejection of these phases is less than certain , as the measured warm neutral and warm ionized medium ( wnm , wim ) gas velocities are typically comparable to the galactic escape velocities @xcite . unfortunately even the most recent attempts to include superwinds in cosmological models of galaxy formation use only simplified single - phase winds , often with energetics and masses based on the observed wnm / wim properties of superwinds ( see e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these models do not properly address the physics of hot - phase metal transport in addition to having overly low values of the energy per particle , which casts the reliability of their conclusions into doubt .",
    "attempts have been made to use measurements of the temperature of the extended soft x - ray emitting plasmas ( @xmath21  @xmath22 k ) in starburst galaxies to constrain whether the hot gas will escape the host galaxy ( see e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but such an approach neglects both the significant kinetic energy expected to be associated with this material and that the soft x - ray emitting plasma is an indirect probe of the properties of the true wind - fluid @xcite .",
    "the detection of apparently thermal diffuse hard x - ray emission of temperature @xmath23 k in the starburst region of m82 in the 33 ks - long _ chandra _ acis - i observations of @xcite suggested it was possible to directly observe and constrain the properties of the wind fluid in a starburst superwind .",
    "we recently obtained and analyzed a new 18 ks _ chandra _ acis - s observation of m82 , and also reprocessed archival _",
    "acis - i and _ xmm - newton _ observations ( total exposure of 48 ks with acis - i , 75 ks with _ xmm - newton _ pn and 102 ks with each mos instrument ) . we confirmed the presence of both diffuse continuum and diffuse @xmath24 fe he@xmath0 line emission within the central starburst region ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hence forth referred to as paper i ) .",
    "having assumed that the line - emitting plasma is metal - enriched to @xmath25 , we found that the observed iron line luminosity of @xmath26 ",
    "@xmath27 was consistent with the properties of the wind fluid expected given m82 s star formation rate , provided that the sn thermalization efficiency was high .",
    "however the diffuse hard x - ray continuum luminosity of @xmath28 was too luminous to be the thermal bremsstrahlung associated with the wind fluid given the parameters assumed when interpreting the iron line emission .",
    "in this paper we consider in greater detail what constraints the observed hard x - ray properties of m82 can place on the properties on the superwind and the wind - fluid , in particular the efficiency of sn heating ( @xmath29 ) and the degree of central mass - loading ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "ultimately these determine the energy per particle of the wind fluid .",
    "we restrict analysis to the starburst region within @xmath31 pc of the center of m82 .",
    "we calculate the x - ray emission using both multi - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations and the 1-dimensional analytical @xcite model ( hence forth referred to as the cc model ) . by using the simple but relatively accurate cc model we can explore the predicted x - ray properties of the wind fluid in models covering a wider range of parameter space than if we used multi - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations alone .",
    "a variety of recent papers have presented theoretical calculations of the broad - band x - ray emission from individual star - forming clusters , using either the adiabatic cc model , or the non - adiabatic solution of silich and collaborators @xcite , with the aim of seeing if the particular model used can explain the observed data .",
    "our motivation differs from these papers , in that our aim is to use theoretical models in combination with observational data on m82 to constrain fundamental properties of the superwind . in addition",
    "our approach differs from these previous papers in its use of x - ray line luminosities rather than purely broad - band x - ray luminosities . in reality",
    "the broad - band emission might be dominated by non - thermal continuum sources .",
    "furthermore line emission is more sensitive than the thermal continuum luminosity to interesting parameters such as the plasma temperature .",
    "the observational constraints derived in paper i on the diffuse hard x - ray emission within @xmath32 pc of the nucleus of m82 from the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations are summarized in table  [ tab : paper1 ] .",
    "these comprise a robust 6.69 kev iron line detection ( @xmath33 in significance ) , an upper limit on the 6.96 kev iron line , and from the _ chandra _ observations the luminosity of the diffuse continuum .",
    "for the _ chandra_-based observations the values refer to the diffuse emission alone , after the exclusion of detected point - like x - ray sources and corrections for undetected point sources based on the observed point source luminosity function . these luminosities also include 32% and 20% upward corrections to the luminosities derived from the acis - s and acis - i data to account for regions excluded from the spectra due to remove the emission from detected point sources .",
    "for the _ xmm - newton _ observation the line luminosities include all emission within @xmath32 pc , but the contribution to the line luminosities from point - like sources is expected to be small in this particular observation .",

    "[ fig : m82_3color ] this region is much smaller than the full 12-kpc - scale superwind that is most often studied in optical @xcite or soft x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "as discussed in paper i the nature of the diffuse broad - band continuum is not clear .",
    "if the continuum is thermal then the relative strength of the iron line emission to the observed continuum is much lower than expected for a plasma of solar elemental abundances , let alone the iron - enriched plasma expected from recent core - collapse sne .",
    "we demonstrated that a wind mass - loaded with additional ambient gas could produce the total broad - band x - ray luminosity that we observe , but the required degree of mass loading could not sufficiently reduce the relative strength of the iron line to the continuum .",
    "thus the best fit bremsstrahlung models for the continuum do not necessarily provide meaningful estimates of the temperature of the iron - emitting plasma , and should be interpreted with caution .",
    "power law spectral models provide a marginally better fit to the continuum than do thermal bremsstrahlung models .",
    "thus a non - thermal process such as inverse compton x - ray emission might be responsible for the majority of the diffuse hard x - ray continuum .",
    "the x - ray luminosity associated with inverse compton emission depends sensitively on the unknown magnetic field strength within the starburst region . in paper",
    "i we estimated it might account for @xmath45% of the observed diffuse x - ray luminosity in the @xmath1  8 kev energy band , although other authors have in the past given higher luminosity estimates for inverse compton emission from m82 @xcite .    the upper limits on the iron 6.96 kev / 6.69 kev line flux ratio of @xmath46 place upper limits on the temperature of @xmath47 if the plasma is in collisional equilibrium ( see table  [ tab : temp_estimates ] ) .",
    "the coulomb relaxation and ionization equilibrium timescales presented in paper i are much shorter than the timescale for plasma to flow out of the starburst region , so the assumption of collisional ionization equilibrium is reasonable .",

    "hard x - ray emission in multi - dimensional hydrodynamical models of superwinds is dominated by the thermal emission from starburst region itself @xcite .",
    "if the starburst region is spherical then the plasma properties of this region obtained from hydrodynamical simulations agree very well with the simple one - dimensional radially - symmetric analytical cc model , in which the mechanical energy and returned gaseous ejecta from core - collapse supernovae are injected at a uniform rate only within a radius @xmath115 , and radiative energy losses are assumed to be negligible .",
    "gravity and any surrounding ambient gaseous medium are ignored .    as the feedback parameters we wish to constrain are related to the observable x - ray emission via the plasma properties in the starburst region it is worthwhile for us to explicitly reproduce the analytical solution obtained by @xcite .",
    "we consider the conditions under which the adiabatic assumption inherent in the cc model may be invalid in appendix  [ app : radiative_case ] , but we will show that for most reasonable parameters associated with the m82 starburst ( described below ) the radiative energy losses are not significant .",
    "in real galaxies starburst regions are better described as disks or ring of star - formation rather than spherical regions . to explore the predicted x - ray emission for our default model of the m82 s disk - like starburst we begin by using 2-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations in cylindrical symmetry to predict the plasma properties within the a radius of 500 pc of the center of the galaxy .    however , with appropriate scaling ( see appendix  [ app : non_spherical ] ) , it is possible to use the 1-dimensional cc model with a spherical starburst to predict the plasma properties of the wind fluid within a non - spherical starburst region to high accuracy , and to predict the hard x - ray emission from even larger regions with an accuracy no worse than the uncertainties in the observed x - ray luminosities .",
    "these scaled cc models are considerably faster to calculate than a full hydrodynamical model , so we will use them to explore how the constraints on the thermalization efficiency and mass loading change if we adopt a different range of parameters for the m82 starburst .",
    "this approach , in particular the use of the scaled cc model , is applicable only to the study of the wind fluid in the vicinity of the starburst region .",
    "it is not intended for use as a model of an entire superwind as it neglects the interaction between the wind fluid and the multiphase ambient ism .",

    "the basic adiabatic cc model is a function of only three parameters : @xmath482 , @xmath347 , and @xmath115 . @xcite",
    "were the first to point out that for certain values of these parameters , in particular small @xmath115 and/or high @xmath347 , the total luminosity predicted by the cc model was comparable to the net energy injection rate and that the analytical cc solution was no longer self - consistent as it assumed energy losses to be negligible .",
    "they developed a self - consistent radiative solution , later tested with numerical hydrodynamical simulations @xcite .",
    "there in not an exact and easily evaluated function that may be used to assess whether the adiabatic assumption is valid for any particular combination of @xmath482 , @xmath347 , and @xmath115 .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite state that the threshold between the adiabatic and the fully radiative solution occurs when the radiative energy losses per unit volume exceed @xmath155% of the energy injection rate per unit volume .",
    "@xcite show that this is most likely to occur at the very center of the star cluster or starburst region .    in terms of the variables defined in ",
    "[ sec : theory ] , the adiabatic solution becomes invalid when @xmath483    equivalently , if @xmath484 then radiative losses are high and the cc model is invalid .",
    "note the strong dependence on the mass injection rate and any mass loading , and inverse dependence on the energy injection rate , thermalization efficiency and effective radius .",
    "the higher the mean energy per particle , or the larger the starbursting region is , the less - likely significant radiative losses become .",
    "@xcite and @xcite provide examples of star clusters with properties such that radiative losses are severe .",
    "however , the mass and energy injection rates they generally use have significantly lower values of the energy per particle ( and hence higher radiative losses for a given assumed metal abundance ) than what we consider appropriate for clusters in a m82-like starburst .",
    "equation  [ equ : app : radthresh ] may be rewritten as an explicit function of the cluster mass .",
    "we rewrite the energy and mass injection rates as a function of the star cluster mass assuming in this case an instantaneous starburst model , such that @xmath485 and @xmath486 , where @xmath487 is the total cluster mass in units of @xmath488 ( again using a salpeter imf between the lower and upper mass limits of 1  @xmath172 ) .",
    "note that the value of @xmath489 and @xmath490 are a functions of the age of the cluster , and are largest in magnitude for a cluster age of @xmath491 myr in the starburst99 models .",
    "the critical cluster mass above which cooling exceeds 30% of the energy injection and the cc model is no longer valid is then @xmath492    for the purposes of illustration we consider a cluster of age @xmath493 myr , for which @xmath494 and @xmath495 .",
    "for unit @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath226 the central temperature in the cc model would be @xmath496 ( equivalent to @xmath497 ) .",
    "assuming @xmath309 the cooling function is @xmath498 cm@xmath208 @xmath500 .",
    "the massive star clusters observed by @xcite in the nuclear starburst region of m82 have half - light radii of between 1  3 pc .",
    "we adopt a typical cluster radius of @xmath501 = 2 pc . substituting these values into equation  [ equ : app : m6_v1 ]",
    "we find @xmath502 for unit thermalization efficiency and no additional mass loading then no realistic cluster will lie in the radiative regime .",
    "significant mass loading within the cluster ( e.g.  @xmath503 ) or low thermalization efficiency ( @xmath504 ) are required to reduce @xmath487 to of order unity for a @xmath493 myr old cluster .",
    "an older cluster is even less likely to be radiative . from the starburst99 models we find that at an age of 20 myr the mass injection from stellar winds has declined dramatically yielding a net mass injection rate a factor 5 lower than at an age of 5 myr .",
    "the energy injection rate is also lower , but only by a 2.5 . at this age",
    "even clusters of mass a few times @xmath505 are still adiabatic even if @xmath503 or @xmath504 .",
    "we rewrite the energy and mass injection rates as a function of the star formation rate @xmath191 , so that @xmath506 and @xmath507",
    ". if we use the values given in table  [ tab : burst ] for constant star formation with an age of 30 myr , again assuming a metal abundance of @xmath309 , we find that the star formation rate must exceed @xmath508 before the adiabatic cc solution becomes invalid .",
    "for m82 the star formation rate is @xmath509 ",
    "@xmath192 for the salpeter imf assumed , and the starburst region has effective radius of @xmath510 pc at smallest ( and more likely @xmath511 pc ) . thus the cc model is valid unless mass loading is significant @xmath329 ) or thermalization is inefficient @xmath512 , or some combination of the two .",
    "note that a low value for the participation fraction @xmath226 will reduce the tendency of the starburst region to be radiative .",
    "we conclude that under most , but not all , conditions the adiabatic @xcite model is appropriate for m82 s nuclear starburst .",
    "it is possible to use the spherical analytical cc model to predict the wind - fluid properties and emission from a disk - like starburst of diameter @xmath203 and total height @xmath204 by applying modest numerical corrections that are a fixed function of the geometry alone .",
    "as long as the adiabatic assumption is valid these correction factors do not depend on the starburst energy or mass injection rates , and are thus independent of the thermalization efficiency @xmath29 and the mass loading factor @xmath30 .",
    "in the analytical cc model the surface area of the starburst region @xmath513 controls the gas density within the starburst region by limiting the rate at which matter can flow out of it , as described in   [ sec : ccmodel ] ( see in particular equ .",
    "30 of @xcite ) .",
    "note that other parameters , in particular the central temperature and the terminal velocity of the wind are independent of the starburst geometry .",
    "thus , for a given fixed energy and mass injection rate , the central density and pressure in a disk - like starburst of surface area @xmath514 should be very similar or identical to values in a spherical starburst of the same surface area @xmath515 .",
    "we tested whether this is indeed the case using the vh-1 hydrodynamical code run in 2-d cylindrical symmetry as described in   [ sec : hydromodel ] .",
    "this code reproduces the standard spherical cc solution to within an accuracy of 0.1% for an assumed spherical starburst . for a disk - like starburst of diameter @xmath221 pc and @xmath222 pc (   [ sec :",
    "theory : applying : sbsize ] ) a spherical starburst of equivalent surface area has @xmath308 pc .",
    "we find that the central density and pressure predicted by vh-1 for this disk - like starburst geometry differs from the values it predicts for a @xmath308 pc spherical starburst by only 3.1% .",
    "adopting another disk - like geometry with the same surface area ( @xmath516 pc and @xmath517 pc ) yields central density and pressures within 4.2% of the spherical solution . for the other disk - like starburst geometry suggested by observations of m82 , with @xmath518 pc and @xmath519 pc",
    "the 2-d simulations predict central densities and pressures within 3.7% of the spherical starburst with equivalent surface area ( @xmath520 pc ) .",
    "these simulations demonstrate that we can accurately predict the gas properties _ within _ a disk - like starburst region using the spherical cc model of equivalent starburst surface area .",
    "the flow pattern exterior to the starburst region is also influenced by the geometry of the starburst region .",
    "a disk with @xmath521 will weakly collimate the flow along the minor axis and give the superwind a preferred direction even in the absence of external collimation by the ism . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dsim ] we illustrate this by plotting the density and velocity fields for equivalent spherical and disk - like starbursts .    for our purposes",
    "the main effect is that the resulting non - spherical flow alters the total volume emission integral within any fixed region that is larger than the starburst region . within the starburst region itself",
    "this effect is not particularly significant when evaluating total gas masses or emission integral given the relative uniformity of the density and pressure .",
    "however , outside and above a disk - like starburst region the gas density drops off with increasing height more slowly that the @xmath522 predicted by the cc model .    calculating",
    "the correct emission integral for a disk - like starburst based the results of the spherical cc model thus entails some geometry - based corrections because of the different starburst region volumes and secondly due to the non - spherical flow pattern outside the starburst region .",
    "the first correction is trivial to evaluate analytically .",
    "the second correction must be determined from a full hydrodynamical simulation of the specific disk - like starburst , and further depends on the size of region @xmath523 we wish to evaluate the emission integral over .",
    "our procedure for calculating the gas properties and total emission of disk - like starburst regions using the spherical cc model is as follows :    1 .   for a given starburst geometry evaluate the surface area",
    "@xmath515 , and run a simulation using the cc model using the effective starburst radius @xmath524 .",
    "this accurately predicts the values of fluid variables such as density , temperature and pressure _ within _ the starburst region .",
    "2 .   macroscopic variables , in particular the volume emission integral , require further geometrical corrections to make the emission integral predicted using the spherical cc model , @xmath525 , match the emission integral found in a full multi - dimensional simulation of a non - spherical starburst region @xmath526 .",
    "3 .   the volume of the starburst region in the spherical model is larger than the volume of the disk - like starburst region , so the volume emission integral predicted by the cc model within some radius @xmath527 must be scaled by a factor @xmath528 equal to the ratio of the starburst region volumes : @xmath529 4 .",
    "a full hydrodynamical simulation for a given disk - like starburst must be run to evaluate the correction @xmath530 to the emission integral within the chosen @xmath523 due to the non - spherical flow pattern manifest outside the starburst region .",
    "we use @xmath531 pc to match the region from which the m82 nuclear region spectra analyzed in paper i were extracted .",
    "simulations of different disk - like starburst regions where we altered the thermalization efficiency and mass loading demonstrated that the correction @xmath532 to the total emission integral is a fixed function of the geometry , and is independent of the energy and mass injection rates .",
    "the temperature - dependent differential emission measure for the scaled cc model @xmath533 is calculated using the factors discussed above : @xmath534 .",
    "combining this with the temperature - dependent cooling functions and summing over all temperatures gives the final predicted luminosity for the chosen energy band or line .    for @xmath531 pc and a disk - like starburst with @xmath221 pc and @xmath222 pc , the primary geometry we apply to m82 , the non - spherical emission integral correction factor @xmath535 .",
    "for the alternate disk - like starburst geometry with @xmath518 pc and @xmath519 pc the correction factor is @xmath536 .",
    "for the compact starbursting disk with @xmath216 pc and @xmath217 pc the correction factor is @xmath537 .    with these scalings",
    "the spherical cc model can be used to predict to high accuracy the total emission integral from the wind fluid within @xmath523 for a disk - like starburst .",
    "this method is less accurate at reproducing the luminosity predicted by a full 2-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation because non - spherical flow pattern leads to subtle differences in the shape of the differential emission integral ei(t ) compared to a spherical cc solution .",
    "we compared the luminosities predicted by a small suite of hydrodynamical models with different disk - like starburst geometries to the results from the scaled cc analytical model in order to assess the significance of this effect .",
    "the error introduced by the effect is small in terms of computing the total cooling rate ( @xmath538% for the sutherland & dopita cooling curve ) , or even the the x - ray luminosity over the broad 0.3  2.0 kev or 2  8 kev energy ranges ( @xmath374% ) . for the high energy lines we are interested in because of their temperature sensitivity the effect is larger , and",
    "the associated errors in predicted line luminosity can be as large as @xmath155% .",
    "nevertheless these uncertainties do not compromise the usefulness of the scaled cc model as they are comparable to the observational uncertainties in the nuclear region s , ar and ca luminosities of the well detected lines from the _ xmm - newton _ data , and less than the uncertainties in the diffuse fe he@xmath0 line luminosity derived from the _ chandra _ acis - s data .",
    "the relative effect of these uncertainties on the region of model parameter space matching our chosen constraints can be seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : vh1_vs_scaledcc ] .",
    "there are two main environments that in principle might reduce the fraction @xmath226 of all the sne and stellar winds in a starburst region that can contribute to powering a superwind .",
    "the first , likely to to be the most significant but also hardest to estimate , is physical confinement and increased radiative cooling of young supernova remnants and stellar winds occurring in regions of high ambient gas density such as molecular clouds .",
    "the second is that radiative losses may be high for those sne and stellar winds associated with massive stars in massive and compact star clusters ( particularly super star clusters ) , where the adiabatic cc solution is no longer valid .",
    "there are some observational findings that are suggest that some fraction of the sne in m82 s nuclear starburst occurred within regions of gas number density @xmath539 @xcite , although there are problems with this interpretation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . however , based on the total molecular gas mass of @xmath540 within the starburst region , the fraction of the total starburst region volume occupied by such dense gas must be @xmath541 or lower @xcite .",
    "massive stars will be born in regions of high gas density , so that if confinement does occur the magnitude of the drop in @xmath226 may well be larger the the filling factor of the dense gas . at present",
    "we can not rigorously quantify the effectiveness of confinement , nor the fraction of stars that might be affected .",
    "@xcite speculate that perhaps as much as 50% of the sne in m82 occur in dense regions , in which case the participation factor may be as low as @xmath542 .",
    "it is possible to quantitatively estimate the role that over - cooling of the thermalized sn and stellar wind ejecta in dense star clusters have on @xmath226 .",
    "based on the discussion in appendix  [ app : radiative_case ] we conclude that only the compact clusters of radii a few parsecs and masses @xmath543 ( salpeter imf , mass limits 1  100 @xmath441 ) are likely to suffer significant radiative losses ( and then only under certain conditions ) .    for a star cluster mass function of the form @xmath544 between the mass limits @xmath545 and @xmath546 and where @xmath547 @xcite , the fraction of the total stellar mass in clusters with @xmath548 is @xmath549    we adopt a minimum cluster mass of @xmath550 and a maximum cluster mass of @xmath551 @xcite . for @xmath552 then @xmath553 .",
    "thus the magnitude of the reduction in @xmath226 due to radiative cluster winds is small , of order 15% , even if sn and stellar wind thermalization is inefficient , and/or there are long - lived sources of additional mass loading in the massive star clusters .                                                                                                                          , m. & chieffi , a. 2007 , in american institute of physics conference series , vol .",
