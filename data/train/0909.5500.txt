    "blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcdgs ) are a subset of low - luminosity galaxies undergoing strong and short - lived episodes of star formation at the present time .",
    "they usually exhibit a compact , irregular morphology and display intense , narrow emission lines superposed on a blue continuum . due to the low metallicity and the considerable gas consumption involved in the violent star - formation ,",
    "it is mostly believed that unlike spirals the star formation in bcdgs takes place in transient , sporadic bursts .",
    "the origin and nature of their starburts is still , however , poorly understood .",
    "there is increasing observational evidence that interactions of bcdgs with dwarf galaxies trigger the star formation activity in these systems [ i.e. @xcite;@xcite;@xcite ] optical images of bcdgs rarely show clear interaction features , but interferometric hi  studies have resulted in surprises . indeed , neutral hydrogen gas is the best tracer for galaxy - galaxy interactions because it is more easily disrupted by tidal forces than the stellar disk .",
    "hi  observations also provide an estimate of the total dynamical mass and the neutral gas content . combining hi  data with parameters such as the absolute luminosity , star formation rate , stellar and dust content or the oxygen abundance can furnish powerful clues about the nature and evolution of bcdgs .",
    "we obtained deep multi - wavelength data of a sample of nearby bcdgs combining broad - band optical / nir  and h@xmath0  photometry and optical spectroscopy with deep 21-cm radio continuum and line observations .",
    "the latter were obtained with the _ australia telescope compact array _ ( atca ) interferometer using full synthesis observations ( 12 hours ) in four different array configurations .",
    "we selected 10 bright bcdgs that were detected in the _ hi  parkes all - sky survey _",
    ", hipass ; @xcite;@xcite .",
    "some bcdgs are apparently isolated ( he 2 - 10 , ic  4662 , ic  4870 , eso  108-g017 , pox  4 ) , while others belong to a galaxy pair ( tol  1924 - 416 , ngc  1510 ) or a galaxy group ( tol  9 , tol  30 and ngc 5253 ) .",
    "the radio data of the galaxies ngc  1510 , ngc  5253 and ic  4662 are part of _ the local volume hi  survey _",
    "( lvhis10 mpc ) .",
    "http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/lvhis _ for details .",
    "the final radio maps will be obtained by combining all available arrays , having both high sensitivity ( hi  column density of @xmath1 @xmath2 for a 40 `` beam ) and good angular ( @xmath3 '' ) and velocity ( @xmath4 kms@xmath5 ) resolution .",
    "one of the key points in our analysis is to compare the properties derived for bcdgs belonging to galaxy groups with those that are in pairs or apparently isolated .",
    "tol 9 is located in the center of the klemola 13 group , its optical properties were published in @xcite;@xcite .",
    "the hi  map ( figure  [ fig1 ] , _ left _ ) shows that the neutral gas is found in two regions : one associated with the spiral galaxy eso 436 - 46 and the other embedding tol 9 and two nearby objects , revealing a long hi  tail in direction to eso 436 - 44 and eso 436 - 45 , galaxies mainly composed by old stellar populations .",
    "the hi  cloud in which tol 9 an its surrounding dwarf galaxies are embedded seems to rotate as a single entity @xcite .",
    "the kinematics of the tail suggest that it is of tidal origin .",
    "our analysis of the hi  gas in tol 30 has revealed two faint tails starting at opposite sides of the galaxy , where the brightest hii  regions are located ( figure  [ fig1 ] , _ right _ ) . the northern tail hosts around 15% of the total hi  mass of the system .",
    "we detected a detached hi  cloud at the ne of tol 30 that seems to show rotation .",
    "our deep optical images confirm the detection of an object within this hi  cloud .",
    "we think it is not a tidal dwarf galaxy but an independent nearby low - luminosity dwarf galaxy that interacted with tol  30 .",
    "the analysis of the hi  kinematics in ngc  5253 reveals a velocity gradient along the optical minor axis of the galaxy ; it does not show any sign of regular rotation @xcite .",
    "some authors suggested that this feature is an outflow .",
    "however , we think that its origin may be the disruption / accretion of a dwarf gas - rich companion or the interaction with another galaxy in the m83 subgroup .",
    "two of the bcdgs in our sample reside in a galaxy pair .",
    "the hi  map of tol  1924 - 416 reveals a huge amount of neutral gas and an hi  bridge towards the companion galaxy .",
    "the hi  bridge has @xmath633% of all the neutral gas of the galaxy pair , and it has probably expelled from tol  1924 - 416 . a detailed analysis of the neutral gas of the galaxy pair ngc  1512 and the bcdg ngc  1510 is presented in @xcite .",
    "our data strongly support the interaction - induced scenario to explain both the hi  features and the star - formation activity in the system , that seems to be experiencing the first stages of a minor merger .",
    "the optical appearance of ic  4870 shows a compact star - forming core embedded in an elliptical low - luminosity component but its hi  map ( figure  [ fig2 ] , _ left _ ) reveals a lot of neutral gas and two long tails arising in opposite directions .",
    "we detect two maxima of the hi  emission located at the beginning of the tails .",
    "the northern tail is quite straight and does not show important variations in its kinematics , but the southern tail is slightly curved towards the w. this tail possesses a knot at the south that hosts @xmath614% of all the hi  mass of the system and shows a velocity gradient .",
    "all these facts suggest that ic4870 is experiencing a merging of two independent hi  clouds , being the origin of its strong star - formation activity .",
    "the hi  distribution found in the bcdg eso 108-g107 ( figure  [ fig2 ] , _ right _ ) is more than 5 times the optical size .",
    "we detected a long tail towards the nw that has peculiar kinematics and is not aligned with a faint optical tail found at the w of the bcdg .",
    "the hi  distribution and kinematics of the eastern neutral gas also suggest the presence of a tail in this area .    the analysis of the hi  properties of the bcdg ic 4662 is presented in @xcite .",
    "the low column density gas shows a kind of tail towards the east .",
    "the kinematics are very disturbed : the overall velocity gradient runs from the north - east with velocities of 220 kms@xmath5  to the south - west with velocities of 380 kms@xmath5 , changing direction by about 90@xmath7 in the centre of ic 4662 .",
    "the chemical properties of some of the hii  regions are also intriguing and may suggest the presence of two objects that have experienced different chemical evolution .",
    "we performed a multi - wavelength analysis of some nearby bcdgs combining broad - band optical / nir and h@xmath0 photometry , optical spectroscopy and 21-cm radio observations .",
    "we show that the hi  data are fundamental to understand their nature and dynamical evolution .",
    "all analyzed bcdgs show interaction features despite if they are located in a galaxy group , a galaxy pair or are apparently isolated .",
    "our study confirms @xcite and @xcite conclusions that interactions with or between low - luminosity dwarf galaxies are the main trigger mechanism of starbursts , specially on bcdgs .",
    "however these dwarf objects are only detected when deep optical images and complementary hi  observations are obtained .",
    "therefore , bcdgs seem not to be real isolated systems .    [ 1 ] barnes , d.g .",
