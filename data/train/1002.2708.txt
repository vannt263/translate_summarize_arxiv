    "statistical ensembles of 2d coulomb particles ( referred to also as logarithmic gases , @xmath0-ensembles or dyson gases ) at a particular value of inverse temperature , @xmath1 , are known to have remarkable integrable properties .",
    "their partition functions , regarded as functions of properly chosen parameters of the background trapping potential ( coupling constants ) , can be identified with tau - functions for hierarchies of nonlinear integrable equations such as 2d toda lattice ( 2dtl ) or kadomtsev - petviashvili ( kp ) hierarchies .",
    "equivalently , the tau - function provides a generating series for correlation functions of the dyson gas .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give an explicit representation of the partition functions as vacuum expectation values of certain operators constructed from free fermions , in the spirit of the kyoto school @xcite .",
    "similar constructions in the context of random matrix models of different types were given in @xcite .",
    "however , most of the previous studies were devoted to canonical ensembles with a fixed number of particles , @xmath2 , which after f. dyson @xcite are customarily viewed as eigenvalues of a @xmath3 random matrix .",
    "the canonical partition function , @xmath4 , is then tau - function of the 2dtl hierarchy with the discrete variable @xmath2 .",
    "a natural question is whether this construction can be extended to grand canonical ensembles .",
    "taking a weighted sum of the @xmath4 s , @xmath5 , one obtains a quantity whose interpretation in terms of integrable hierarchies is presently not clear . a way to introduce a grand canonical ensemble of 2d coulomb charges with transparent integrable properties",
    "was first suggested in @xcite .",
    "the idea is to consider the logarithmic gas with varying number of particles in the presence of an ideal conductor , so that each particle interacts not only with other particles of the gas but also with their  mirror images \" of opposite charge .",
    "the grand canonical partition functions of such systems appear to be tau - functions of the 2dtl or kp hierarchies ( depending on whether the conductor fills a disk or a half - plane ) , whose  times \" again serve as parameters of the background potential but in a different manner .",
    "the fermionic operator construction of these tau - functions is technically even simpler than that for canonical ensembles .",
    "our motivation comes from growth problems of laplacian type such as viscous flows in the hele - show cell @xcite . at zero surface tension",
    ", the model has an integrable structure of the 2dtl hierarchy in the zero dispersion limit @xcite .",
    "from mathematical point of view , the same integrable hierarchy stays behind some classical problems of complex analysis : parametric deformations of conformal maps @xcite , boundary value problems for laplace operator @xcite and the inverse potential problem in two dimensions @xcite . switching on the dispersion thus coming back to the original 2dtl hierarchy ,",
    "one obtains a non - trivial deformation of this integrable structure .",
    "however , the corresponding deformation of laplacian growth and , what would be even more intriguing , of the above mentioned problems of complex analysis , is not yet formulated explicitly in proper terms .",
    "the theory of logarithmic gases provides another view on these matters @xcite . in the thermodynamic limit , when the number of particles is very large , the logarithmic gas in the leading approximation macroscopically looks like a charged fluid with continuous density .",
    "the equilibrium state of the system is a result of competition between the mutual repelling of particles , which tends to remove them to infinity , and the external force which attracts each particle to local minima of the background potential .",
    "typically , in the equilibrium the fluid occupies some compact domains in the plane around local minima of the background potential , which we call droplets .",
    "the shape of the droplets is determined by their total charge and by the profile of the trapping potential .",
    "when one increases the total charge keeping the potential fixed , the droplet changes its shape according to the growth law specific for the laplacian growth processes ( the darcy s law ) . at the same time",
    ", the integrable deformation of the @xmath6 picture is naturally build in the 2d coulomb gas .",
    "we believe that the reformulation of the model in terms of free fermions may help to clarify the geometrical meaning of this deformation .",
    "another interesting question is what kind of growth problems emerge in the thermodynamic limit of the grand canonical ensembles .",
    "we give a partial answer restricting ourselves to the grand canonical ensemble in the upper half - plane , in which case the growth problem is equivalent to laplacian growth of  fat slits \" considered in @xcite .",
    "in this section we recall the free fermionic construction @xcite of kp and 2dtl tau - functions .",
    "let @xmath7 , @xmath8 , be free fermionic operators with usual anticommutation relations @xmath9_+ = [ \\psistar_n , \\psistar_m]_+=0 $ ] , @xmath10_+=\\delta_{mn}$ ] .",
    "they generate an infinite dimensional clifford algebra .",
    "we also use their fourier transforms [ ferm0 ] ( z)=_k-1pt_k z^k , ( z)=_k-1pt_k z^-k which are regarded as free fermionic fields in the complex plane of the variable @xmath11 .    neutral bilinear combinations @xmath12 of the fermions generate the lie algebra @xmath13 .",
    "normal ordering of the generators ( see below ) allows one to consider certain infinite sums as well . exponentiating these expressions",
    ", one obtains an infinite dimensional group which is a central extension of @xmath14 .",
    "let us call elements of the clifford algebra of the form @xmath15 group - like elements .",
    "a characteristic property of the group - like elements @xmath16 is that @xmath17 is a linear combination of @xmath18 s and similarly for @xmath19 : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , where the matrix @xmath22 is determined by the matrix @xmath23 .",
    "of particular importance are the group - like elements obtained by exponentiating the operators [ ferm2 ] j_+ = _ k1t_k j_k , j_- = _",
    "k1t_-k j_-k where @xmath24 are fourier modes of the  current operator \" and @xmath25 are parameters ( called times ) . in general",

    "the wick s theorem is often used in the following form .",
    "let @xmath49 be linear combinations of @xmath18 s only and @xmath61 be linear combinations of @xmath50 s only , then @xmath62 let us also give an explicit formula for the expectation value of products of the fields @xmath29 , @xmath63 : [ ferm5 ]    c +   + .    one may define the normal ordering @xmath64 with respect to the dirac vacuum @xmath65 when all annihilation operators are moved to the right and all creation operators are moved to the left taking into account their anticommutativity under mutual permutations . for example , @xmath66 , and , more generally , @xmath67 .",
    "we also note the identities [ ferm7 ]    l e^_k _ k=1+(e^-1)_k _ k = e^(e^-1)_k _ k , +   + e^_k _",
    "k=1+(e^-1 ) _ k _ k = e^(e^-1 ) _ k _ k.    as it has been established in the works of the kyoto school , the expectation values of group - like elements are tau - functions of integrable hierarchies of nonlinear differential equations .",
    "in particular , [ ferm6 ] _ n ( t_+ , t_-)=e^j_+ge^-j_-is the tau - function of the 2dtl hierarchy meaning that it obeys the infinite set of hirota bilinear equations for the 2dtl hierarchy the simplest of which is @xmath68 in a similar manner , [ ferm6a ] ( t_+)=e^j_+gis the tau - function of the kp hierarchy .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the group - like elements of the clifford algebra can be also written as normal ordered exponents of the form [ ferm1 ] g=(_mna_mn_m _ n ) for regular ( invertible ) elements @xmath16 , this normal ordered expression is just equal , modulo a constant factor , to an exponent of a fermionic bilinear form without normal ordering but with some other matrix @xmath69 ( an example is provided by ( [ ferm7 ] ) , see also @xcite for a more general case ) .",
    "if @xmath16 is invertible , then the tau - function at any @xmath70 is not identically zero .",
    "however , there is an important class of tau - functions which vanish identically at some values of @xmath70 .",
    "they correspond to _ singular _ elements @xmath16 which are not invertible ( and thus do not belong to a group in a strict sense ) but still can be represented in the normal ordered form ( [ ferm1 ] ) .    here",
    "are two important examples of such singular elements : [ ferm8 ]    l = _",

    "i0_i _ i .    in a sense , these operators are projectors to positive and negative modes respectively . their properties ( extensively used in what follows ) can be easily seen from the definition .",
    "the both operators obey the projector property : @xmath71 .",
    "the operator @xmath72 kills negative creation modes standing to the right and negative annihilation modes standing to the left and commutes with all positive modes : [ ferm9 ]    l p_+ _ k = _",

    "k p_- = 0 , k0 , +   + [ p_- , _ k ] = [ p_+ , _ k ] = 0 , k < 0 .    from this",
    "it is obvious that @xmath74 at @xmath38 and @xmath75 at @xmath36 .",
    "similarly , @xmath76 at @xmath36 and @xmath77 at @xmath38 . somewhat less obvious properties ( also used in what follows ) are @xmath78 , @xmath79 .    as an example , let us calculate the tau - function corresponding to the singular element @xmath72 : @xmath80 . here",
    "we follow @xcite .",
    "first of all , it is not difficult to see that @xmath81 at @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "for @xmath84 we have : @xmath85 to proceed , it is convenient to use the short hand notation @xmath86 , @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is any operator from the clifford algebra , then we can write @xmath89 equations ( [ ferm4 ] ) imply [ ferm4a ]    l +   + .",
    "so the operators @xmath90 , @xmath91 in the formula for @xmath92 contain only positive modes and , therefore , commute with @xmath72 .",
    "moving one @xmath72 to the right and another one to the left , and using the properties mentioned above , we obtain @xmath93 by the wick s theorem .",
    "the expectation value under the determinant can be represented as a contour integral as follows : @xmath94 the whole determinant can then be written as an @xmath2-fold contour integral : [ unitary ] _",

    "let us fix an arbitrary measure @xmath97 in the complex plane and consider the following group - like element : [ can1 ] g_0 = ( _ _ + ( z)_+(1/|z ) d(z ) -_j0 _ j _ j ) here @xmath98 , @xmath99 are truncated fourier series containing only positive modes . obviously , @xmath100 commutes with @xmath72 . expending the exponent into a series",

    "for @xmath84 we have : @xmath103 substituting the explicit form of @xmath100 , we get : @xmath104 the next step is to notice that only the term with @xmath105 contributes to the sum and all other terms vanish .",
    "indeed , at @xmath106 the state @xmath107 is in fact the null state because the number of annihilation operators exceeds the number of creation operators while at @xmath108 the operator @xmath109 is in fact the null operator because @xmath73 multiplied by the uncompensated positive @xmath110-modes from the right gives @xmath111 ( see ( [ ferm9a ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , the expression simplifies to @xmath112 since there are as many annihilation operators to the right of @xmath73 as creation ones , the state that they produce from the vacuum is proportional to the vacuum state itself ,",

    "for particular choices of @xmath129 the integral ( [ can4 ] ) yields the partition functions of random matrix models of certain types in terms of eigenvalues .",
