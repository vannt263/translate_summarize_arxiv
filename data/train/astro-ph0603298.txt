    "the growth of large scale structure in the early universe is one of the important issues in the understanding of structure formation in context of hierarchical models of galaxy formation ( e.g. , press & schechter 1974 ; peebles 1993 ) . since the discovery of an overdensity region ( or a proto cluster ) of galaxies in a deep survey field , ssa22 ( steidel et al . 2000 ;",
    "see also matsuda et al .",
    "2005 ) , deep surveys of such overdensity regions have been intensively made , leading to findings of clustering of galaxies at @xmath14 5  6 ( shimasaku et al . 2003 ; ouchi et al .",
    "2005 ; wang et al .",
    "2005 ; malhotra et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "in addition to these findings , deep surveys for sky areas surrounding high - redshift active galactic nuclei such as radio galaxies and quasars also succeeded in finding overdensity regions ; e.g. , ( 1 ) a radio galaxy , tn1338@xmath151942 at @xmath16 ( venemans et al . 2002 ; miley et al .",
    "2004 ) , ( 2 ) a radio galaxy , tn 0924@xmath152201 at @xmath17 ( venemans et al . 2004 ; overzier et al . 2005 ) , ( 3 ) a quasar , sdss j1030 + 0524 at @xmath18 ( stiavelli et al . 2005 ) , and ( 4 ) a radio - loud quasar , sdss j0836 + 0054 at @xmath19 ( zheng et al . 2005 ) . among these interesting overdensity regions ,",
    "we present our deep survey for ly@xmath9 emitters ( hereafter laes ) in the zheng et al.s field surrounding the radio - loud quasar sdss j0836 + 0054 at @xmath19 because this quasar is one of our target high-@xmath13 quasars ( ajiki 2006 ; ajiki et al .",
    "2006 in preparation ) .",
    "as demonstrated in previous optical narrow - band imaging surveys , a redshift range between @xmath20 and 5.8 is one of favorable windows for any ground - based telescopes because oh airglow emission lines are fairly weak at @xmath21 815 nm , corresponding to a ly@xmath9 redshift of @xmath22 ( e.g. , hu et al . 1999 , 2004 ; rhoads & malhotra 2001 ; rhoads et al . 2003 ; see for a review taniguchi et al .",

    "we have carried out very deep optical imaging in the field surrounding the quasar sdss j0836@xmath280054 at redshift 5.8 ( fan et al .",

    "2004 ) on mauna kea .",
    "the suprime - cam consists of ten 2k @xmath29 4k ccd chips and provides a very wide field of view , @xmath30 ( 0@xmath312 pixel@xmath27 ) . in this survey , we used broad - passband filters , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "we also used a narrow - passband filter , _",
    "nb816 _ , centered on 815 nm with a passband of @xmath32 nm ; the wavelength corresponds to a redshift of 5.65  5.75 for ly@xmath9 emission .",
    "all observations were done under photometric conditions , and the seeing was between 0@xmath317 and 1@xmath311 during our observing runs made in 2004 ( see for details ajiki 2006 ; ajiki et al .",

    "the individual ccd data were reduced and combined using imcat by the standard process .",
    "we performed photometry of the objects a ",
    "g found by zheng et al .",
    "the photometry is performed with a @xmath33 diameter aperture for each band image of which image sizes of the stars have a fwhm of 1@xmath3115 .",
    "the limiting magnitudes are @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 for a 2@xmath40 detection with a @xmath33 diameter aperture .",
    "the reason for the use of a @xmath33 diameter aperture is to exclude possible light contamination of neighbor objects around each target object from a to g. note that the light contamination in the object f could not be excluded completely even when we use the above small aperture .",
    "the results of the photometry are summarized in table [ tab : obj ] . since all of objects except for the object f in table [ tab : obj ]",

    "this object is seen at 1@xmath3112 ne from object b.    if the excess in _ nb816 _",
    "is due to ly@xmath9 emission , the redshift of b@xmath46 is @xmath47 being very similar to the photometric redshift of b , @xmath48(line ) = 5.8 ( see section 3.3 ) .",
    "the angular separation ( 1@xmath3112 ) between b and b@xmath46 corresponds to a projected distance of 6.5 kpc at @xmath49 .",
    "the angular distance of b@xmath46 from the quasar is 74@xmath319 .",

    ". this luminosity is typical among the laes found at @xmath49 ( e.g. , ajiki et al .",
    "2003 ; hu et al .",

    "( 2005 ) in our @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath12 images provides supporting evidence that they are high - z objects . since we have _",
    "nb816 _   photometry in addition to the broad bands , we can derive precise information of redshifts using the narrow - band data .",
    "for instance , a lae at @xmath535.655.75 shows _",
    "excess to the @xmath54 band while _",
    "nb816 _   dropout objects are considered to be at @xmath55 ( shioya et al .",

    "as shown in table 1 objects a and f were detected 2.2 @xmath40 and 5@xmath40 significance in the narrow - band image , respectively .",
    "note that the object f is apparently affected by the foreground object seen in the north .",
    "however , since one can identify their _ nb816 _   counterparts to the @xmath6 image ( fig .",
    "[ thum ] ) , we consider that detection of a and f is real .",
    "they are not _",
    "nb816 _   dropout objects and thus their redshifts are probably not greater than 5.8 . since zheng et al .",
    "( 2005 ) estimated their photometric redshifts of 5.7  5.8 , at least the objects a and f may be associated closed to the quasar redshift of 5.8 .",
    "for the remaining seven objects , _",
    "nb816 _   was not detected above 2 @xmath40 level .",
    "however , we can not conclude if their redshifts are grater than 5.8 or not here because the limiting magnitude of _ nb816 _   is not deep enough compared to each @xmath54 magnitude .",
    "photometric redshift technique with _",
    "nb816 _   and the broad bands provides possible redshifts of them from our photometric data ( section 3.3 ) .",
    "zheng et al .",
    "( 2005 ) estimated photometric redshifts for the nine objects a  g using the bayesian photometric redshift technique ( bentez 2000 ) based on their hst acs data , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . since we have _",
    "nb816 _   photometry for the nine objects , it is worthwhile estimating their photometric redshifts because this trial gives an independent test for zheng et al.s ( 2005 ) results . note that our photometry is made with a @xmath33 aperture and thus the magnitudes given in table [ tab : obj ] are not total magnitudes .",
    "therefore , we use only our photometric data of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and _",
    "nb816_.    using the maximum likelihood described in shioya et al .",
    "( 2005a ; see for our sed templates , nagao et al .",
    "2004 ) , we estimate a most probable photometric redshift for each object . in this procedure , we adopt an allowed redshift of between @xmath58 and @xmath59 with a redshift bin of @xmath60 .",
    "our photo-@xmath13 analysis suggests that objects a , b , and f may be low-@xmath13 sources ; @xmath61 for a , @xmath62 for b , and @xmath63 for f. these are due to that our @xmath64 colors of these three objects are slightly bluer than those ( @xmath65 ) of zheng et al .",
    "however , the photometric accuracy in zheng et al .",
    "( 2005 ) in their @xmath56 and @xmath57 seems to be better than ours in @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we , therefore , adopt a @xmath48 whose likelihood is high at high-@xmath13 domain .",
    "we do not know that the nine objects are always strong laes .",
    "therefore , we estimate two kinds of photometric redshifts ; one is @xmath48(no line ) in which there is no ly@xmath9 emission , and @xmath48(line ) in which the effect of ly@xmath9 emission is taken into account . in table",
    "[ tab : obj ] , we give our results together with the bayesian photometric redshifts ( @xmath66 ) obtained by zheng et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "we find that our estimates are nearly consistent with those by zheng et al .",
    "however , as for the three components of object c ( c , c2 , and c3 ) , our results are slightly different from theirs . this difference may be attributed to that our photometry is affected by neighbor objects to some extent because our image quality is not as good as hst acs data . since it is likely that most galaxies at @xmath23 show the ly@xmath9 emission ( e.g. , taniguchi et al . 2005 and references therein )",
    ", we consider that the reliability of @xmath48(line ) could be better than that of @xmath48(no line ) . if this is the case , the seven objects ( a , b , c3 , d , e , f , and g ) have redshifts between @xmath19 and @xmath67 .",
    "although spectroscopic follow - up observations are necessary , we may conclude that most of the objects found by zheng et al .",

    "2004 ; dickinson et al . 2004 ; bouwens et al . 2005 ) , they suggested that this region shows an overdensity of galaxies by a factor of six . although one can not rule out the effect of the cosmic variance",
