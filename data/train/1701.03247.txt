    "demand for wireless data service has continued to accelerate , driven by the proliferation of advanced mobile devices and data - intensive applications such as video on demand and cloud computing .",
    "as link level transmission rates approach their fundamental limits , network level improvements have drawn increasing attention .",
    "as proposed in the long term evolution - advanced ( lte - a ) standard , a large number of small cells ( picos , femtos , relays , remote radio heads , and wifi access points ( aps ) ) will be deployed under the coverage of legacy macro - cells to boost network capacity per unit area  @xcite . compared to current and previous generations of cellular networks , it is much more challenging to allocate physical resources efficiently in a heterogeneous network ( hetnet ) formed by densely deployed aps .",
    "one challenge is user association , which is traditionally decided according to the maximum reference signal receive power ( maxrsrp ) rule , i.e. , each user equipment ( ue ) is assigned to the ap with the maximum receive power . in the downlink",
    ", maxrsrp association may lead to severe load imbalance between macro and pico tiers due to their differences in transmit power , signal propagation , and cell coverage  @xcite .",
    "a simple remedy is _ range extension _",
    "@xcite , where a bias factor is added to the rsrp of small cells .",
    "more complicated user association schemes have been studied for network utility maximization  @xcite .",
    "many such optimization problems are considered with orthogonal frequency - division multiple access ( ofdma ) .",
    "binary variables are in general used to indicate the ue - ap associations on a set of subcarriers or resource blocks .",
    "the optimization problem is often a difficult non - convex mixed - integer program .",
    "inter - cell interference management is especially challenging for cell edge ues .",
    "an effective means to mitigate interference is to orthogonalize the spectrum allocations across adjacent cells according to certain frequency reuse patterns .",
    "fractional frequency reuse is often more efficient and has been introduced to guarantee high throughput of cell center ues  @xcite .",
    "dynamic fractional frequency reuse was recently studied in  @xcite for ofdma networks .",
    "the problem is usually formulated as deciding the subcarrier assignment to individual ues according to instantaneous channel state information ( csi ) and service demand . due to the overhead of csi exchange , such multi - cell dynamic spectrum allocation is usually coordinated within an autonomous cluster of no more than a few aps .    in this paper , user association and spectrum allocation",
    "are jointly considered based on the slow timescale optimization framework proposed in  @xcite .",
    "resource allocation on the fast ( milliseconds ) timescale , e.g , scheduling , usually depends on instantaneous channel and traffic information .",
    "collecting this information for hundreds of aps and thousands of ues is currently infeasible on a fast ( milliseconds ) timescale .",
    "therefore , a slow timescale is proposed to allow adequate time during each decision period for information exchange and to solve the optimization problem . at the same time , using a timescale of seconds to minutes allows one to track macro channel and traffic variations caused by user migration , service initiation / termination , and slow fading .",
    "( to get a sense of the csi overhead , consider 100 aps each sending 30,000 parameters ( 16 bits each ) to the central controller once every minute .",
    "the aggregate data rate is about 0.8 mbps , which is quite small . )",
    "resource allocation on such a slow timescale is to improve the average user quality of service ( qos ) given the average csi and traffic statistics .",
    "of course dynamic scheduling based on instantaneous csi remains at each individual ap to adapt its own resources on a fast timescale .",
    "this study builds on the network model described in  @xcite .",
    "each slice of time - frequency resource is shared by a subset of aps .",
    "we shall refer to this subset of aps as the corresponding _",
    "pattern_. in a hetnet of @xmath0 aps , there are in total @xmath1 patterns , which correspond to all possible ways the aps can share the spectrum . assuming backlogged traffic and constant transmit power spectral densities ( psds ) , a particular pattern determines the average signal to interference plus noise ratio ( sinr ) and hence the spectral efficiency of each link from a serving ap to a ue . in principle , the spectrum is divided into @xmath1 segments of variable bandwidths ( some of which can be zero ) . we consider highly flexible user association where each ap can further divide each of its @xmath2 allocated patterns into arbitrary non - overlapping pieces to serve all or any subset of ues in the network . with @xmath3 ues ( or ue groups ) , a network utility optimization problem with @xmath4 variables is formulated to cover all possible allocations",
    ". we can optimize any performance metric that depends on the aggregate service rates , e.g. , the average packet delay  @xcite or the number of active aps ( for energy savings )  @xcite .",
    "it has been proved in  @xcite that , as long as the utility function to be maximized is concave , there exists an optimal solution that activates at most @xmath3 out of the @xmath1 patterns . for relatively small networks",
    "( with about 10 aps ) , the proposed solution demonstrates substantial performance gain over existing user association and interference management techniques .",
    "however , the computational complexity becomes prohibitive when the number of aps exceeds 20 .    in this paper",
    ", we utilize the fact that inter - cell interference is a local phenomenon in a large network to pursue a fully scalable solution .",
    "the number of variables is reduced from @xmath4 to @xmath5 by limiting the patterns to cover only local neighborhoods within dominating interferers .",
    "global coordination is then guaranteed by introducing inter - cluster constraints on the local patterns . to obtain a feasible allocation ,",
    "a combination of centralized convex optimization and hypergraph coloring is used . in the numerical results , we use the proposed scalable approach to allocate spectrum and",
    "assign ues in a network with 100 aps .",
    "the solution achieves approximately three times the network throughput compared with full - spectrum reuse combined with maxrsrp user association in scenarios of interest .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "related work is reviewed in section  [ sec : rework ] .",
    "the global optimization problem is formulated in section  [ sec : optprob ] , and is then relaxed to provide a scalable formulation in section  [ sec : relax ] .",
    "a coloring - based approach is developed in section  [ sec : scasol ] to yield a feasible solution given the previous relaxation .",
    "numerical results are shown in section  [ sec : numres ] .",
    "section  [ ch5_sec : con ] concludes the paper .",
    "user association has been extensively studied for code - division multiple access ( cdma ) networks  @xcite .",
    "results there suggest that joint user association and power control can significantly improve the performance of a cdma network .",
    "many recent studies focus on system utility maximization in ofdma hetnets , which often requires solving non - convex integer programs .",
    "game theory has also been used to derive simple distributed scheduling policies ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "optimal linear precoder design and base station selection are considered for uplink hetnets in  @xcite .",
    "the authors of  @xcite studied spectrum sharing by strategic operators in the unlicensed band . while each operator is free to transmit over the entire common spectrum subject to the maximum power constraint , leading to the tragedy of commons",
    ",  @xcite characterized more favorable nash equilibria of both a one shot game and a repeated game .",
    "in contrast to the slow - timescale setting here , the aforementioned studies focus on dynamically updating user and resource allocation on a relatively fast timescale , which depends on the instantaneous channel realizations .    the stochastic geometry framework way proposed to evaluate and optimize the expected system performance over random topologies and channel conditions  @xcite .",
    "the approach does not apply to the optimization of resource allocation to all possible interference patterns as considered in this paper .    in  @xcite ,",
    "a slow - timescale model similar to the model considered in this paper was proposed .",
    "user association and spectrum allocation are jointly optimized to maximize the sum rate under proportional fairness constraints .",
    "there are two major differences between  @xcite and our approach here .",
    "first , we allow rather realistic stochastic traffic , whereas  @xcite is limited to backlogged traffic and rate maximization .",
    "second , the proposed algorithm in  @xcite avoids exponential complexity by limiting to a small number of global patterns _ a priori_. here , the proposed scalable solution includes all possible patterns as candidates .",
    "we consider the problem of allocating a block of spectrum of @xmath6 hz across @xmath0 aps in the downlink of a hetnet .",
    "denote the set of all ap indices as @xmath7 .",
    "we consider centralized global resource allocation on a slow timescale .",
    "the timescale is conceived to be on the level of a minute or even longer , which is in contrast to the millisecond frame - level scheduling in current lte systems .",
    "the relatively long decision period is more than sufficient for collecting traffic and channel information from all aps , and also allows the use of advanced optimization tools to solve large optimization problems . on this slow timescale",
    ", we assume the spectrum is homogeneous in the sense that all hertz are equally valuable .    in this work , a _ pattern",
    "_ refers to a subset of aps , often denoted as @xmath8 .",
    "there are @xmath1 distinct patterns in total .",
    "every allocation can be viewed as a partition of the spectrum into segments ( or colors ) corresponding to those patterns . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:3ap ] for the case of 3 aps , the spectrum is divided into 7 segments , excluding the empty pattern @xmath9 .",
    "ap 1 has exclusive use of segment @xmath10 , and shares segments @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 with the other aps .",
    "let @xmath14 denote the bandwidth allocated to pattern @xmath15 .",
    "assuming the total available bandwidth is 1 unit , we have : @xmath16 an efficient allocation always sets @xmath17 .",
    "each ap further divides each segment to serve different ues . on the slow timescale ,",
    "ues near each other often have similar average channel conditions .",
    "to reduce complexity , it is then reasonable to treat ues near each other with similar qos requirements and propagation conditions as a group .",
    "the aggregate traffic of a ue group is modeled as a single queue .",
    "denote the set of all @xmath3 groups of ues as @xmath18 .",
    "this is without loss of generality , since in the extreme case each group contains a single ue .",
    "the packet arrivals for group @xmath19 ues are modeled by a poisson process with rate @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath21 denote the bandwidth used by ap @xmath22 to serve group @xmath19 under pattern @xmath15 .",

    "also , the exclusive spectrum has higher spectral efficiency than shared spectrum , e.g. , @xmath29 . in general , @xmath30 the spectral efficiency @xmath26 can either be calculated based on pathloss and other impairments or measured over time .",
    "let @xmath31 denote the average packet length in bits .",
    "we shall normalize the spectral efficiency by multiplying by @xmath32 so that the units are packets / second",
    ". for concreteness in obtaining numerical results , we use shannon s formula to calculate spectral efficiency : @xmath33where @xmath34 if @xmath35 and @xmath36 otherwise , @xmath37 is the transmit psd at ap @xmath22 , @xmath38 is the power gain of link @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the noise psd at group @xmath19 ues .",
    "here we assume fixed flat transmit psds over the slow timescale .",
    "the link gain @xmath38 includes pathloss and shadowing effects , again reflecting the slow timescale considered in this paper .",
    "hence @xmath38 and consequently @xmath41 are constants in each decision period independent of the frequency .",
    "the service rate to group @xmath19 contributed by ap @xmath22 over pattern @xmath15 is @xmath42 .",
    "the total service rate can be calculated by summing over all aps over all patterns . in the 3-ap example",
    ", all three aps may use parts of their assigned spectra to serve group 1 , whose total service rate is then given by : @xmath43as shown later in the paper , each ue group is highly likely to be served by a single ap , and only a limited number of patterns are allocated nonzero bandwidth .",
    "the bandwidths also imply user association .",

    "we refer to @xmath50 as _ intra - cell allocation_. due to the complexity of the model , we ignore the reduced interference during vacant periods of ap queues and assume all aps transmit at ` conservative ' rates obtained by assuming all queues are backlogged , as introduced in  @xcite . instead of the fixed transmit psd in  , we can apply a similar approach as in  @xcite to alternatively update bandwidth allocations and psd distributions .",
    "however , the focus of this paper is to find a scalable solution to  [ eq : ch5_opt ] .",
    "hence , fixed psds are assumed here .",
    "[ eq : ch5_opt ] can be viewed as a generalization of previous collision - based formulations .",
