    "x - ray astronomy has entered a new era now that _ chandra  _ and _ xmm - newton  _ are in orbit .",
    "their high sensitivities and unprecedented image qualities bear great promises but also pose new challenges . in this paper , we outline problems of object detection in x - ray images that were not previously encountered . in doing so , we compare the performances of various detection techniques on simulated _ xmm - newton  _ test images , incorporating the main instrumental characteristics .    the x - ray observations consist of counting incoming photons one by one , recording their time of arrival , position and energy .",
    "later , the event list is used to create images for a given pixel scale and energy band .",
    "various x - ray telescope effects complicate this simple picture  the point spread function ( psf ) and the telescope effective area ( the vignetting effect ) , both dependent on the off - axis angle and incoming photon energy ; detector effects like quantum efficiency variations , different zones not exposed to x - ray photons ; environmental and background effects like solar flares and particle background . even for relatively large exposures",
    ", the x - ray images could contain very few photons , and some sources could contain only a few tens of photons spread over a large area . consequently , it is important for the source detection and characterization procedures to be able to cope with these difficulties .    as an example",

    "one of the best methods for point - like source detection and flux measurements is emldetect  but we stress again that the psf model used for the ml procedure needs to be close to the image psf for the most accurate photometry .",
    "serious drawbacks are the relatively large number of spurious detections as well as the splitting of the extended sources , which we were not able to suppress even with 6 simultaneous psf profile fits in the multi - psf mode ; this seriously hampers the analysis of the extended sources .",

    ", the photometry is accurate within 10 - 20% for both point - like and extended objects .",
    "this uncertainty can be regarded as an intrinsic error due to the poissonian nature of the x - ray images .",

    "better results for photometry may eventually be obtained if the intrinsic shape of the extended objects is known , and if the two objects are detected . however , in most of the cases with small separation , there is no indication of blending  which is a dangerous situation for flux reconstruction . in such cases",
    ", there may exist some spectral signatures of the effect .",
    "the identification process of x - ray sources relies on their positional accuracy .",
    "we have shown that for objects with more than 100 counts in 10 ks exposure images and within the inner @xmath19 of the field - of - view , the one sigma positional error is of the order of one half of the fwhm of the psf ( @xmath49 , tab .  [",
    "tab : dr ] ) . for extended objects , because of their shallower profiles and depending on the number of photons and the off - axis distance , the detected centre could even be at about @xmath12 from its input position .    comparing series of simulations with 100 ks and 10 ks in two energy bands ",

    "moreover , for faint fluxes , these effects tend to be masked by the large number of spurious detections with emldetect .",
    "although this method seems to give correct results for the @xmath27 down to fainter fluxes than mr/1+se , in real situations it is impossible to asses the contribution of the numerous spurious detections . from our simulations",

    "<S> procedures based on current methods to detect sources in x - ray images are applied to simulated _ xmm - newton  _ images . </S>",

    "<S> unresolved sources represented by the telescope psf and extended ones represented by a @xmath0-profile model . </S>",
    "<S> different sets of test cases with controlled and realistic input configurations are constructed in order to analyze the influence of confusion on the source analysis and also to choose the best methods and strategies to resolve the difficulties .    in the general case of point - like and extended objects the mixed approach of multiresolution ( wavelet ) filtering and subsequent detection by sextractor   </S>",
    "<S> gives the best results . </S>",
    "<S> in ideal cases of isolated sources , flux errors are within 15 - 20% . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum likelihood technique outperforms the others for point - like sources when the psf model used in the fit is the same as in the images . </S>",
    "<S> however , the number of spurious detections is quite large .    </S>",
    "<S> the classification using the half - light radius and sextractor  stellarity index is succesful in more than 98% of the cases . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that average luminosity clusters of galaxies ( @xmath1kev } \\sim    3\\times 10^{44}$ ] erg / s ) can be detected at redshifts greater than 1.5 for moderate exposure times in the energy band below 5 kev , provided that there is no confusion or blending by nearby sources .    </S>",
    "<S> we find also that with the best current available packages , confusion and completeness problems start to appear at fluxes around @xmath2 erg / s/@xmath3  in [ 0.5 - 2 ] kev band for _ xmm - newton  _ deep surveys . </S>"
