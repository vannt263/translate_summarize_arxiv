    "in our model , in addition to the sm particle content , we introduce two majorana fermionic dm fields @xmath5 , which are neutral under the sm gauge groups , and a heavy singly - charged scalar mediator @xmath6 to allow the two dm fields to interact with the right - handed leptons . for simplicity , we restrict ourselves to the case where the two dms only couple to the two heavier families of leptons , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",

    "we further assume that the yukawa couplings @xmath11 are all real in the bases of the dm and lepton mass states .",
    "furthermore , the constraints from the lepton flavor violating process @xmath12 and the dm relic density force us to take the hierarchical form of the yukawa couplings @xmath13 . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume the equal value @xmath14 of the ( off-)diagonal entry : @xmath15",
    "it is well - known that the dipole operator of a majorana particle vanishes .",
    "however , for a model with multiple neutral majorana particles there still exist the transition dipole moments . in this section , we will show that the decay of the heavy majorana dm particle into the lighter one via the transition electric dipole operator can naturally explain the cluster x - ray line at 3.55 kev .",

    "clearly , if the imaginary part of the yukawa couplings is of the same size as the real one , the mdm would be the main contribution since @xmath26 .    in order to make numerical studies , we need to transform the lifetime presented in ref .",

    "if we consider more constraints from other experiments , the upper bound on @xmath30 would further decreased , which will be discussed in sec .",
    "it is clear that a successful prediction of the correct dm relic abundance is one of the most important tests for the viability of a dm model .",
    "usually , for a cold dm , the generation of its relic abundance is assumed to proceed by the thermal freezing - out mechanism , which relies on the thermally averaged effective dm annihilation cross section at the time of the freeze - out .",
    "since the two dms have the highly degenerate masses by the construction , the coannihilations between @xmath37 and @xmath38 have to be considered  @xcite .    for a fermionic dm with its freezing - out mainly through @xmath39-channel annihilations",
    ", it is well - known that the thermally averaged effective annihilation is dominated by the @xmath40-wave contribution , which usually requires large couplings and/or light mediators to enhance the annihilation so as not to over - close the universe",
    ". let us make this point more precise by looking into the leading tree - level feynman diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig_ann ] .",
    "since the annihilation with the definite incoming dms and outgoing leptons involves @xmath41- and @xmath42-channels , if the yukawa couplings in the two diagrams are the same , the destructive interference between the two channels would cause the leading @xmath4-wave contribution to be vanishingly small .",

    "[ fig_result ] , where we have used the central value of the most recent planck result @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "finally , we remark that the neglect of the other annihilation channels to the effective cross sections does not affect the final prediction of the dm relic abundance much , with the correction within 5% at best , since they are @xmath40-wave suppressed as mentioned before .",
    "in the previous sections , we have shown that our two - component dm model can not only explain the x - ray line observed from the distant galaxy clusters but also naturally give rise to the desired dm relic abundance in the universe .",
    "however , it is clear that in order for this scenario to be viable , we have to investigate if it satisfies with the constraints from other aspects of particle physics , such as flavor physics , direct dm detections , and collider searches .",
    "the most stringent flavor constraint on the model comes mainly from the lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) process @xmath55 , which proceeds via the dipole operator @xmath56 with the coefficients @xmath57 : @xmath58 where the function @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 the branching ratio for this lfv process is  @xcite : @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the fine structure and fermi constants , respectively . in eq .",

    "currently , the most stringent cross section bound for the dark matter mass range of interest is from the lux experiment  @xcite , in which for the 33 gev dark matter the spin - independent cross section bound is of @xmath67  @xmath68 . for the present leptophilic dm model , the relevant scattering of two dm components with the target nucleus",
    "is proceeded by the mediation of a virtual photon .",
    "as discussed in the literature  @xcite , we first need to identify the relevant effective operators with the dms coupled to a photon , and then calculate the scattering probability of the dm particles with the target nucleus .",
    "each dm can be viewed as a majorana particle in the mass eigenstate basis @xmath69 , so that if the scattering does not change the dm component , for the so - called component - conserving scattering , one has to only consider the following two kinds of dimension - six effective operators @xmath70 where @xmath71 and",
    "however , as pointed in ref .",
    "@xcite , it can be proved that @xmath72 by using the chisholm identity , which results in a single kind of the dimension - six operator for the majorana fermions .",
    "this kind of operators can be matched to the electromagnetic anapole moment of each dm component , which further couples to the current from the target nucleus in the non - relativistic limit and realizes the anapole dark matter  @xcite .",

    "note that in eqs .",
    "( [ xsi ] ) and ( [ xsd ] ) , the factor 1/2 accounts for the half density carried by each dm component in the universe , while 2/4 the right normalization of the transition scattering in accord with the previous two component - conserving ones .    from eqs .",
    "( [ xsi ] ) and ( [ xsd ] ) , it is obvious that the spin - independent part is the dominant one due to the large charge @xmath88 enhancement for the heavy target nuclei , such as xenon used in the lux experiments .",
    "however , the differential cross section in the recoil energy @xmath89 is suppressed by an additional power of @xmath90 or @xmath89 compared with the usual dirac fermionic dm case , resulting in a weak direct detection constraint . an estimate made in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath91 with the typical reference recoiled energy and the similar masses of @xmath5 and @xmath6 gives the dm - nucleon scattering cross section of @xmath92 , which is evidently much smaller than the current lux bound for the spin - independent dm - nucleon cross section  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we do not show the direct dm detection constraints on our model . finally , we point out that if the restriction on the real yukawa couplings is relaxed , the same one - loop feynman diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig_dip ] would also induce the following transition operators : @xmath93 with the corresponding wilson coefficients @xmath94,\\quad\\quad c_{4}^t = \\frac{-2e}{64\\pi^2 m^2_\\eta}\\frac{1}{4}\\sum_\\ell i^t_{\\ell},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 .",
    "if the imaginary part of @xmath11 is the same order as the real one , the dominant contribution to the direct detection experiments is given by the spin - independent cross section induced by the operator @xmath96 .",
    "in this case , there is no suppression caused by the small recoiled energy @xmath89 or the dm velocity @xmath90 , and in turn the lux experiments have already given strong constraints to this model , effectively ruling out all the parameter space trying to explain the x - ray excess .",
    "a large portion of the parameter space of the present model has already been probed by the lep and lhc experiments .",
    "since our two dm components do not directly couple to the electron at tree - level by the construction , they can not be directly pair produced at the lep so that the relevant monophoton constraints  @xcite do not apply .",
    "another collider signal in our model is related to the production of the singly - charged scalar @xmath6 mediated by a virtual photon or @xmath86-boson .",
    "when the mass of @xmath6 is lighter than about 100 gev , it can be pair produced at the @xmath97 colliders , which has been already ruled out by the null results at the lep . since the maximum energy of the lep is about 200 gev , we take 100 gev as the lep bound for the charged mediator mass as an illustration in our study . at the lhc ,",
    "the signal of this leptophilic model is the creation of the charged mediator pair via the drell - yan process , each of which decays further into a lepton plus one of the dm particles  @xcite .",
    "the signature at hadron colliders is a pair of opposite - sign leptons with some missing transverse energy .",
    "such a signature is very similar to that of searching for the right - handed sleptons with mixings in the mssm at the colliders , for which the current lhc bound of the mass of the charged scalar is about 240 gev as presented in fig .",

    "<S> we study a two - component dark matter ( dm ) model in which the two majorana fermionic dm components with nearly degenerate masses are stabilized by an @xmath0 symmetry and interact with the right - handed muon and tau only via real yukawa couplings , together with an additional @xmath0-odd singly - charged scalar . in this setup , </S>",
    "<S> the decay from the heavy dm to the lighter one via the transition electric dipole yields the 3.55 kev x - ray signal observed recently . </S>",
    "<S> the yukawa couplings in the dark sector are assumed to be hierarchical , so that the observed dm relic abundance can be achieved with the leading s - wave amplitudes without a fine - tuning . </S>",
