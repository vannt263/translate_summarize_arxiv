    "ngc 2366 is classed as a barred magellanic - type irregular ( ibm ) galaxy ( de vaucouleurs  1991 ) .",
    "the distance of 3.44 mpc that we adopt here , determined by tolstoy  ( 1995 ) from cepheid light curves , places ngc 2366 in the m81 group of galaxies ( karachentseva , karachentsev , & brngen 1985 ) . the nearest galaxy is the scd ngc 2403 at 290 kpc .",
    "ngc 2366 has an m@xmath1 of @xmath216.5 which is close to that of the small magellanic cloud , and in terms of color , luminosity , and size ngc 2366 is a typical irregular galaxy ( hunter 1997 ) .",
    "however , ngc 2366 is unusual in that it contains the supergiant  complex ngc 2363 at the southwest end of the galaxy ( youngblood & hunter 1999 ) .",
    "ngc 2363 has the same brightness in , corrected for extinction , as the prototype supergiant  complex , the 30 doradus nebula in the large magellanic cloud , and contains a large fraction of the total current star - formation activity of the galaxy ( aparicio  1995 , drissen  2000 ) .",
    "however , there is also another very large  complex to the west of ngc 2363 as well as numerous smaller  regions scattered along the disk . because of the presence of these two very large  complexes , ngc 2366 has an inferred star formation rate that is towards the high end of the distribution for normal i m galaxies .    in this paper",
    "we present optical , near - infrared , and hi radio interferometer images of ngc 2366 for a comprehensive view of the galaxy .",
    "we analyze them to learn about the star formation processes in this galaxy .",
    "we obtained 21 cm line - emission observations of ngc 2366 with the very large array ( vla ) radio interferometer in its c and d - array configurations .",
    "the c - array observations were made 1989 july 21 with a total on - source time of 235 minutes .",
    "the d - array observations were made 1989 november 7 with a total on - source time of 331 minutes .",
    "the total bandwidth was 3.125 mhz with a channel separation of 24.414 khz , that equals 5.16 .",
    "however , a total of only 64 channels was allowed at that time because of computer limitations , and so the velocity coverage is only 330 . the data were on - line hanning - smoothed , and the resulting velocity resolution is 10 .",
    "the central heliocentric velocity was 107 .",
    "the field center is 7@xmath3 23@xmath4 34.2@xmath5 , @xmath66918  42  ( equinox 1950 , here and throughout ) .",
    "we subtracted the continuum emission in the _ uv_-plane using line - free channels on either end of the spectrum and combined the data from the different arrays . to make maps , we employed a routine in nrao s astronomical image processing system ( aips ) that enables one to choose a sample weighting that is in between the standard `` natural '' weighting , which gives the highest signal - to - noise but at the expense of long wings in the beam , and `` uniform '' weighting , which gives the best resolution but at the cost of signal - to - noise and the presence of negative sidelobes .",
    "we chose a sample weighting that gives a formal increase of only 5% in noise yet with a significant improvement in beam profile over what would have been achieved with `` natural '' weighting . the resulting synthesized beam profile ( fwhm )",
    "is 33.6@xmath728.9 .",
    "this corresponds to 560 pc@xmath7480 pc at the galaxy .",
    "we deconvolved the maps until there were roughly comparable numbers of positive and negative components .",
    "the rms noise in the cleaned channel maps is 1.09 mjy beam@xmath8 .",
    "we also constructed a map cube from the c - array data by itself in order to take advantage of that array s higher resolution .",
    "the resulting synthesized beam profile of those maps is 17.8@xmath713.2  ( 300 pc@xmath7220 pc at the galaxy ) , and the rms noise in a cleaned channel map is 1.9 mjy beam@xmath8 .",
    "( channel maps of the c@xmath6d - array hi data cube are discussed in section  [ sechi ] ) .    to remove the portions of each channel map without emission that are only contributing noise to the map",
    ", we used the maps smoothed to twice the beamsize for a conditional transfer of data in the unsmoothed maps .",
    "the channel maps were blanked wherever the flux in the smoothed maps fell below 2.5@xmath9 .",
    "flux - weighted moment maps were made from the resulting data cube .",
    "the flux in each channel of the c@xmath6d - array data cube was integrated over a square 30  on a side , corresponding approximately to the diameter of the primary beam of the telescope , in order to determine the total hi flux detected in the maps .",
    "the fluxes were corrected for attenuation by the primary beam . to compare with a single - dish observation we integrated the flux over a square 10  on a side as well .",
    "these integrated profiles are shown and compared to the single - dish observation of hunter , gallagher , & rautenkranz ( 1982 ) in figure  [ figsingle ] .",
    "our integrated flux from the 10  box has a peak that is 12% higher than the peak from the single - dish telescope with a 10  beam .",
    "the total integrated flux profile ( over 30 ) is about 36% higher than the single - dish profile .",
    "therefore , we recover all of the gas observed in the 10single - dish observation as well as more gas extended beyond that .    the total hi mass detected within the primary beam of the vla observations is 8.0@xmath10 m. this is smaller by a factor of 10 than what was measured by thuan & martin ( 1981 ) using the nrao 91 m telescope ( 10  beam ) ; only a few percent different from the mass reported by huchtmeier , seiradakis , & materne ( 1981 ) from single - dish mapping ; 1.5 times larger than what is reported by wevers , van der kruit , & allen ( 1986 ) from single - dish mapping ; and 10% larger than the mass given by swaters ( 1999 ) from single - dish mapping .",
    "thus , our integrated hi mass is close to values determined by others ; the thuan and martin value appears to be mistaken .",
    "deep ubv images were kindly obtained for us by p.  massey using a tektronix 2048@xmath72048 ccd on the kitt peak national observatory 4 m telescope 1998 january .",
    "the telescope position was offset 30  between the three images taken in each filter in order to improve the final flat - fielding .",
    "exposure times of 1800 s , 480 s , and 180 s for ubv , respectively , were used .",
    "the electronic pedestal was subtracted using the overscan strip , and the images were flat - fielded using dome and sky flats .",
    "landolt ( 1992 ) standard stars were used to calibrate the photometry .",
    "the pixel scale was 0.42 , the seeing was @xmath111.6 .",
    "deep  images of ngc 2366 were obtained using the perkins 1.8 m telescope at lowell observatory during 3 observing runs 1994 to 1995 .",
    "the observations used an 800@xmath7800 ti ccd provided to lowell observatory by the national science foundation , the ohio state university fabry - perot that was used simply as a 3:1 focal reducer , an  filter with a fwhm of 32 angstroms , and an off - band filter centered at 6440 angstroms with a fwhm of 95 angstroms .",
    "the off - band filter was used to subtract stellar continuum from the  filter to leave only  nebular emission . in order to survey the entire galaxy ,",
    "6 separate pointings were mosaicked to produce the final  image .",
    "observations consisted of several 1800 s or 3000 s images per pointing .",
    "the pixel scale was 0.49 , and the seeing was @xmath112.3 .",
    "near - infrared jhk images of ngc 2366 were obtained using the ohio state infrared imager - spectrograph on the perkins 1.8 m telescope in two observing runs in 1996 and 1997 .",
    "the pixel scale was 1.5 , the field of view was 6.4 , and the effective seeing was 3 .",
    "observations alternated between the galaxy and a separate sky position every 12 minutes . upon each return to the galaxy , the position was offset by 10  around the chip so that the numerous bad pixels would not appear in the same place each time and to aid in removal of stars in the sky frame . a correction for deviation from linearity with increasing signal level",
    "was applied to each of the 4 detectors , observations of a dark filter were subtracted , and flat - field frames were used to remove pixel - to - pixel variations .",
    "the flat - field was determined by observations of a white screen in the dome , and images made with the illuminating lamp off were subtraced from the images taken with the lamp on .",
    "sky - subtracted images were aligned and combined .",
    "the `` ukirt '' standard stars from the list compiled by s.  courteau were used to calibrate the photometry , and so the photometry is on the ukirt system .",
    "the california institute of technology ( cit ) photometric system is 8% bluer in j@xmath2h and 4% bluer in h@xmath2k compared to the ukirt system .",
    "a check on our photometry is provided by comparison to aperture photometry done by others .",
    "aaronson , mould , & huchra ( 1980 ) measured an h magnitude of 10.44@xmath120.08 for ngc 2366 through a 165.2  diameter aperture .",
    "we measure an h magnitude that is 0.37 magnitudes fainter .",
    "their measurement through an aperture of 110.6  diameter is also brighter . on the other hand , our h - band measurement integrated to a radius of 117.5differs by only 0.01 magnitude from that given by pierini   ( 1997 ) .",
    "to examine continuum objects in the field of view of the radio maps , we constructed and deconvolved maps from the c@xmath6d - array _ uv_-data before the continuum was subtracted .",
    "we summed channels not containing hi emission from ngc 2366 .",
    "the 21 cm continuum emission within the primary beam of the vla is shown in figure [ figcontfull ] , and the fluxes of all of the sources in the field of view of the primary beam are given in table [ tabcont ] .",
    "only source 7 lies within the field of view of our v - band image , and we do not detect any corresponding optical object there .    in figure [ figcont ]",
    "we show contours of the continuum emission superposed on the  image of the galaxy , in ngc 2366 , we have primarily detected the supergiant  region ngc 2363 although there is some continuum emission in the direction of the giant  region to the west of ngc 2363 and some emission extending to the north of ngc 2363 .",
    "radio continuum observations of ngc 2363 at other wavelengths have shown the emission to be that of an optically thin , ionized gas ( klein & grve 1986 ) , as expected .",
    "our v - band image of ngc 2366 is shown in figures [ figouterbar ] and [ figallbars ] . in the deep display ( figure [ figouterbar ] )",
    "one can see that ngc 2366 is elliptical - shaped with a high degree of ellipticity implying a relatively high inclination angle . although the bulk of the galaxy is contained within regular isophotes , there is an extension of starlight at a faint surface brightness level along the major axis to the southwest .",
    "this extension is highlighted by a superposed contour at 26.54 magnitudes arcsec@xmath13 in figure [ figouterbar ] .",
    "this low surface brightness starlight is not mirrored at the northeast end of the major axis .",
    "the shallower display of the v - band image ( figure [ figallbars ] ) shows an inner cigar - shaped morphology dominated by the giant star - forming region ngc 2363 at the southwest end of the galaxy .",
    "an intermediate surface brightness contour in figure [ figallbars ] ( the second faintest one ) illustrates an additional asymmetry of starlight within the galaxy that skews the contour to the northwest in the northeastern part of the galaxy and to the southeast in the southwestern part of the galaxy . this skewing could be described as an asymmetrical warp , but it is not found in the outer contours .",
    "ngc 2366 is classified as a barred i m galaxy and the cigar - shaped morphology contributes to the impression that the galaxy is barred .",
    "however , identifying bar structures in irregular galaxies is difficult from morphology alone . as discussed by roye & hunter ( 2000 )",
    ", this identification is complicated by the lack of symmetry provided by spiral arms coming out of the nucleus or bar .",
    "it is particularly complicated in galaxies that are also inclined and often boxy in shape .",
    "this is especially difficult if the bar is comparable in size to the entire galaxy as appears to be the case in , for example , ngc 4449 ( hunter , van woerden , & gallagher 1999 ) .",
    "does ngc 2366 contain an over - sized bar structure , or does it just appear bar - like because it is highly inclined ?    we have explored the possible presence of bars in ngc 2366 by fitting elliptical structures to isophotes .",
    "according to athanassoula  ( 1990 ) , a bar can be fit with a curve of the form @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the semi - major and minor axes and @xmath17 is a parameter that describes the boxiness of the bar structure . for @xmath18",
    "the structure is an ellipse , for @xmath19 the structure is `` disky , '' and for @xmath20 the structure is `` boxy . '' in ngc 2366 , we have fit the inner and outer parts well with a curve with @xmath21 , indicating a boxy shape .",
    "first , we fit the outer isophote at 25.66 magnitudes arcsec@xmath13 ( seen as the inner of the two isophotes in figure [ figouterbar ] ) with a curve that is shown superposed on the v - band image in figure [ figouterbar ] as a thick smooth contour .",
    "the isophotes in figure [ figouterbar ] are determined from a smoothed version of the v - band image to improve signal - to - noise in the outer parts .",
    "one can see that , if we exclude the faint extension to the southwest encompassed by the fainter isophote at 26.54 magnitudes arcsec@xmath13 , the contour at 25.66 magnitudes arcsec@xmath13 nicely encompasses the bulk of the optical galaxy .",
    "this outer `` bar '' has a semi - major axis of 1.6r@xmath0 at a position angle of 32.5 , where r@xmath0 is the radius of the galaxy at a surface brightness of 25 magnitude arcsec@xmath13 in b. the minor - to - major axis ratio @xmath22 is 0.42 .",
    "if the @xmath22 ratio reflects the inclination of the galaxy and the intrinsic ratio of the disk is taken to be 0.3 ( hodge & hitchcock 1966 , van den bergh 1988 ) , the inclination shown by the outer galaxy is 72 .",
    "second , we fit bar structures to two inner isophotes that are more normal in size compared to bars in spirals .",
    "these are shown as thick contours in the inner part of figure [ figallbars ] .",
    "the thick outer contour is reproduced from figure [ figouterbar ] .",
    "one of the inner fits excludes the supergiant  region ngc 2363 and the other includes it since it has been argued that the formation of ngc 2363 may have been facilitated by placement at the end of a bar ( elmegreen & elmegreen 1980 ) .",
    "the sizes , position angles , @xmath22 , and centers of these two bar fits , as well as characteristics of the fit to the outer galaxy , are listed in table [ tabpa ] .",
    "one can see that all three fits have nearly the same position angle .",
    "we are not seeing a twisting of the isophotes from the inner to the outer galaxy which in spiral galaxies is a good clue to the presence of a bar .",
    "the center of the middle isophote is offset from the center of the outer isophote 19  east and 8  north .",
    "the center of the inner isophote is offset 33  east and 31  north because the inner one does not include ngc 2363 .",
    "figure [ figallbars ] also shows the observed isophotes at 26.54 , 25.66 , 24.04 , 23.04 , and 22.68 magnitudes arcsec@xmath13 .",
    "the contour at 24.04 mag arcsec@xmath13 illustrates the skewing of the v - band image that was discussed above .",
    "we will return to this skewed contour in section [ sect : revisit ] below .",
    "in addition to these three carefully selected isophotes that we fit with ellipses by hand , we have done automatic elliptical isophote fitting of the entire v - band image of the galaxy .",
    "we used annuli of 63width out to a radius of 7.4 , and allowed the fitting procedure to fit position , ellipticity , and position angle for each ellipse .",
    "this routine does not allow the boxy structures that we used above  only ellipses .",
    "the results of this type of general fitting procedure should be viewed with caution in lumpy galaxies like ngc 2366 , where young regions here and there can highly influence the fitting .",
    "we found that the inclination angle varied from 68  to 79  and the position angle varied from 29to 34 .",
    "most of the variation  a decrease outward in position angle and inclination  occurred in the inner 3of the galaxy .",
    "some of this variation is undoubtedly due to the difficulty in fitting just mentioned , but it is also possible that some of the variation is the signature of a bar structure with a semi - major axis of @xmath113 .",
    "if the outer isophote is a true bar , its @xmath22 ratio of 0.42 falls within the range of what is observed for bars in late - type spirals ( martin 1995 ) .",
    "however , @xmath15/r@xmath0 is 1.6 in ngc 2366 . in spirals",
    "the ratio @xmath15/r@xmath0 is much smaller : 0.2 for sd  sm galaxies ( elmegreen  1996 ) , 0.050.25 for sd  sdm spirals ( martin 1995 ) , and 0.250.3 for sd s with exponential bars ( elmegreen & elmegreen 1985 ) .",
    "the bar fit to the inner isophote would be reasonable in size compared to these values , while the middle isophote fit would still be a bit large by comparison .",
    "surface brightness cuts , 33  wide , along the major and minor axis of the inner bar are shown in figure [ figbarcut ] .",
    "neither cut can be reasonably fit with a gaussian profile , as they are in a sample of early - type spirals observed by ohta , hamabe , & wakamatsu ( 1990 ) .",
    "the shapes of the minor and major axis cuts individually resemble a few of those observed in late - type barred spirals by elmegreen  ( 1996 ) . among barred late - type spirals ( combes & elmegreen 1993 , elmegreen  1996 )",
    "the bar is commonly well - fit with an exponential whereas in early - type spirals the bars tend to be more uniform in intensity .    thus , we find three isophotes that could be claimed to be bar structures : an inner one that places the supergiant  region ngc 2363 at one end , a middle structure that includes ngc 2363 , and an outer structure that encompasses most of the galaxy . from the surface photometry",
    "there is no compelling evidence that any of these structures is a true bar , but we will return to this issue below when we present the hi data and the velocity field of the gas .      ubvjhk surface photometry is shown in figures [ figubv ] and [ figjhk ] ( see also wevers  1986 ) .",
    "we used ellipses with a position angle of 32.5 , ellipticity corresponding to an inclination of 72 , and a semi - major axis step size of 21 .",
    "the inclination , position angle , and center were determined from the outer isophote shown in figure [ figouterbar ] .",
    "the surface photometry and colors have been corrected for reddening using a total e(b@xmath2v)@xmath23=e(b@xmath2v)@xmath24@xmath60.05 , where the foreground reddening e(b@xmath2v)@xmath24 is 0.043 ( burstein & heiles 1984 ) .",
    "we use the reddening law of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) and a@xmath25/e(b@xmath2v)@xmath263.1 .",
    "thus , a@xmath25 is 0.29 and e(u@xmath2b ) is 0.06 .",
    "we determined r@xmath0 to be 2.6  ( @xmath262.6 kpc ) .",
    "our radius is 27% bigger than that given by de vaucouleurs  ( 1991 ) .",
    "the holmberg radius , r@xmath27 , originally defined to a photographic surface brightness , is measured at an equivalent b - band surface brightness @xmath28 . for a ( b@xmath2v)@xmath29 of 0.27 ,",
    "the holmberg radius is determined at a @xmath30 of 26.66 magnitudes arcsec@xmath13 .",
    "we find that r@xmath27 is 5.1  ( @xmath265.1 kpc ) .",
    "both r@xmath0 and r@xmath27 are determined from the reddening corrected surface photometry .",
    "global properties of ngc 2366 are listed in table [ tabglobal ] .",
    "we fit an exponential disk to @xmath31 , excluding the central 1.2 , and the fit is shown in figure [ figubv ] . except for the central region , ngc 2366 is fit well with an exponential disk profile having a central surface brightness @xmath32 of 22.82@xmath120.09 magnitudes arcsec@xmath13 and a disk scale length r@xmath33 of 1.59@xmath120.04 kpc .",
    "this same exponential also fits @xmath34 reasonably well over the radii where the j - band is detected .",
    "noeske  ( 2000 ) have found a scale length of half this 0.88@xmath120.03 kpc and 0.82@xmath120.03 kpc for b and i - bands , respectively from fitting the inner 2.7  of the galaxy . de jong ( 1996 ) has determined disk characteristics of a large sample of galaxies spanning a wide range in type .",
    "ngc 2366 has a central surface brightness , corrected to the b passband , and an r@xmath33 that are in the middle of the range of what de jong finds for late - type galaxies .",
    "the integrated colors of ngc 2366 are similar to those of the luminous irregular ngc 4449 with the exception that ngc 2366 is 0.10.2 magnitude bluer in the near - infrared ( hunter  1999 ) . like in most irregulars , colors in ngc 2366",
    "are fairly constant with radius ( see also wevers 1984 ) .",
    "integrated values are given in table [ tabglobal ] , and annular colors are shown in figures [ figubv ] and [ figjhk ] .",
    "these figures indicate that ngc 2366 does not exhibit any major color gradient with radius .",
    "it is common lore that irregular galaxies do not have color gradients , and ngc 2366 appears to be perfectly consistent with that , now frequent , assumption .",
    "however , in the case of ngc 2366 , and by extension other irregulars , azimuthally - averaged colors do not in fact tell the whole story . in figure [ figdivbv ] we show a b / v ratio image , averaged @xmath35 pixels to improve the signal - to - noise .",
    "although the galaxy is relatively constant in color with radius in an average sense , there are color variations on large scales .",
    "( the red circular region in the figure at @xmath117@xmath3 23@xmath4 30@xmath5 , 69  21  is due to bright foreground stars . ) in figure [ figdivbv ] one can see a long , blue ridge running the extent of the galaxy , including the central bars identified in figure [ figallbars ] and the unusual , off - axis higher surface brightness extensions to the northwest and southeast .",
    "a 1.5 kpc diameter region @xmath1150  to the west / southwest of the center has a redder stellar population .",
    "this coincides with the center of the hi ring just to the north of ngc 2363 discussed below .",
    "it is 0.10.15 mag redder than the bluer areas of the galaxy outside of  regions .",
    "another large , low surface brightness region @xmath36to the northeast of center also has a red stellar population .",
    "the western part of ngc 2363 also stands out as red , presumably due to the dust that obscures the massive star cluster there ( drissen 2000 ) .",
    "the faint southwest extension of stars outlined by the outer isophote in figure [ figouterbar ] has colors like those of most of the rest of the background galaxy that does not contain  regions .",
    "our  image of ngc 2366 is shown in figure [ figcont ] , and the central portion was also shown by hunter , hawley , & gallagher ( 1993 ) in their study of the extra-  region ionized gas .",
    "although there are numerous star - forming regions in ngc 2366 , the  morphology is dominated by two very large  complexes : ngc 2363 ( numbered i and ii by drissen  2000 ) and a second one directly to the west of ngc 2363 ( numbered iii by drissen  2000 ) .",
    "supergiant  regions like these are rare among normal irregular galaxies ( youngblood & hunter 1999 ) .",
    "ngc 2363 has an l@xmath37 of 1.3@xmath38 ergs s@xmath8 .",
    "this represents 70% of the galaxy s total  luminosity .",
    "ngc 2363 has the  equivalent of the 30 doradus nebula , where 30 doradus is the supergiant  region in the large magellanic cloud that is often taken as defining the class of supergiant  complexes .",
    "( the extinction corrected  luminosity of 30 doradus is taken as @xmath39 , from kennicutt 1984 ) .",
    "the  luminosity is what would be expected of 1260 o7v stars .",
    "figure [ figcont ] does not include two tiny  regions that are located south of ngc 2363 by 2.7  and 3.0 .",
    "( they can be seen in figure [ fighionha ] near 7@xmath3 23@xmath4 , 69  14 ) .",
    "they are in fact the furthest  regions from the center of the galaxy and are located at 6.6 kpc and 5.9 kpc radius in the plane of the galaxy .",
    "the furthest  region corresponds to a distance of 2.5r@xmath0 or 1.3r@xmath27 .",
    "they are part of the faint extension of starlight along the major axis to the southwest seen in the v - band in figure [ figouterbar ] .    in figure [ figha ]",
    "we show the azimuthally - averaged  surface brightness and compare it to @xmath31 .",
    "once past the  region ngc 2363 , the  surface brightness first drops off at a rate roughly comparable to the starlight , but then beyond 4.5 kpc drops off faster .",
    "the current star formation activity ends before the detected starlight ends .",
    "the outer 16% of the galaxy by area in which we detect starlight contains no detectable  region .",
    "the  luminosity and derived star formation rates of the galaxy are given in table [ tabglobal ] .",
    "ngc 2366 has a star formation rate per unit area that is normal , but towards the high end of the range , for irregular galaxies ( hunter 1997 ) . at its current rate of consumption ,",
    "the galaxy can turn gas into stars for another 8 gyr if all of the gas associated with the galaxy can be used .",
    "the timescale to run out of gas becomes 1232 gyr if recycling of gas from dying stars is also considered ( kennicutt , tamblyn , & congdon 1994 ) .",
    "these timescales to exhaust the gas are somewhat short for irregular galaxies ( hunter 1997 ) , but , nevertheless , the galaxy is in no danger of running out of the fuel for star formation any time soon .",
    "ngc 2366 was first mapped in hi with the single - dish radio telescope at effelsberg ( huchtmeier  1981 ) .",
    "they reported that the hi covers 30 .",

    "huchtmeier  ( 1981 ) reported that the hi in ngc 2366 is extended to a radius of 15  at 10@xmath42 .",
    "however , in view of the smearing introduced by the effelsberg beam ( fwhm@xmath118.8 ) , the results could be consistent .",
    "vla maps of the extended hi around ngc 2366 are under analysis and will settle this issue .    in the integrated hi map ,",
    "one can see large clumps of gas within the optical galaxy , arranged approximately in two parallel ridges of hi .",
    "deprojected , the hi appears as a ring with a depression in the middle , similar to sextans a ( skillman  1988 ) .",
    "the ring has a diameter of 5.5 kpc .",
    "two - dimensional ratio images of the b and v - bands suggest that the center of this ring is redder than the surrounding stellar populations ( figure [ figdivbv ] ) .",
    "the center of the ring ( 7@xmath3 23@xmath4 31.3@xmath5 , 69  1953 ) is to the north of the kinematical center and the center of the outer optical isophote by a little more than 1 .",
    "the ridges of gas are surrounded by a more extended relatively smooth distribution of gas . however , in the outer parts we do see a cloud in the southwest surrounded by more diffuse emission . in the northeast",
    "we see a somewhat unusual extension that looks like a `` knob '' extending east from the galaxy with some filamentary material extending south of it .",
    "there is also some filamentary hi emission to the north of the galaxy center around 7@xmath3 23@xmath4 45@xmath5 , 69  24 .",
    "one can also see that the outer shape of the hi distribution is generally consistent with that of the optical galaxy .",
    "specifically , the morphology of the integrated hi indicates a position angle of 23.5  and @xmath22 of 0.41 .",
    "this position angle is 9smaller ( hi oriented further towards the north ) than what we see for the optical galaxy , but the minor - to - major axis ratio is the same .",
    "however , the hi is not centered symmetrically on the optical galaxy .",
    "the hi extends further to the northeast than to the southwest relative to the v - band isophote : the center of the hi morphology is shifted 47  to the east and 54  to the north from the center of the outer optical isophotes",
    ". however , asymmetric distributions of hi are common among disk galaxies ( richter & sancisi 1994 ) .      in figure [ figsurden ]",
    "we show the azimuthally - averaged surface density of the hi gas in ngc 2366 .",
    "we have integrated the hi in 25  radial steps . in determining the surface density",
    ", we had to choose a position angle and inclination which is somewhat problematical given the selection available in table [ tabpa ] , particularly including the different values we will find below from the kinematics of the hi . in this plot we show the surface density that results from two choices of position angle and inclination : 1 ) the values that result from the hi morphology ( 23  position angle and 73inclination ) and 2 ) the values that result from the kinematics of the hi ( 46  position angle and 65  inclination ) .",
    "the choice of the kinematic parameters implies that the hi distribution is not circularly symmetric but elongated .",
    "the choice of the morphologically - derived parameters implies that the hi distribution is axisymmetric , but that there are non - circular motions .",
    "we present both cases , but the conclusions are the same for either choice of parameters .    from the figure we see that , outside the center ( @xmath431.75 ) , the gas surface density drops off fairly smoothly . in order to compare the surface brightnesses in hi , , and v - band ,",
    "we have plotted the logarithm of @xmath44 , the logarithm of @xmath45 , and @xmath31 in magnitudes over the same logarithmic interval .",
    "these are shown in the right panel of figure [ figsurden ] . there",
    "we can see that the hi surface density drops off much more slowly than the starlight or star formation activity .",
    "this is also what we found for the ibm galaxy ngc 4449 ( hunter  1999 ) .    in the left panel of figure [ figsurden ]",
    "we compare the gas surface density profile of ngc 2366 to that of average i m , sdm , and sd galaxies .",
    "the average profile for i m galaxies comes from broeils & van woerden ( 1994 ) and those for the spirals from cayatte  ( 1994 ) who obtained the data for individual galaxies from broeils and van woerden and warmels ( 1988 ) .",
    "this type of comparison requires that the observations be at similar physical spatial resolutions and that there be many resolution elements across the galaxy .",
    "the beam of our ngc 2366 observations is small compared to the hi extent of the galaxy which is about 21 beam - widths in radius .",
    "the observations of i m galaxies by broeils and van woerden have hpbws of 3401020 pc with a median of 400 pc ( for an h@xmath29 of 65  mpc@xmath8 ) .",
    "this is comparable to our ngc 2366 resolution of 560 pc@xmath7480 .",
    "the hpbws of the observations of spirals , on the other hand , vary from 530 pc to 5190 pc ( median of 2600 pc for sdm and 1070 pc for sd galaxies ) .",
    "therefore , the profiles for the spirals are affected by a larger beam size compared to that of ngc 2366 .    what we see in figure [ figsurden ]",
    "is that the hi surface density of ngc 2366 is comparable to the average of a sample of i m galaxies in the inner 3.5 .",
    "the ngc 2363 complex is dominating at @xmath46 . beyond 3.5",
    "the hi falls off more slowly than in other i m galaxies and the hi extends much further .",
    "the spiral samples on average have much lower surface densities in the center , perhaps because of resolution effects and the fact that the gas is dominated by molecular material rather than atomic ( honma , sofue , & arimoto 1995 ) , and drop quickly at smaller radii .      in ngc 2366",
    "the ratio of integrated hi content to starlight , , is 1.36 .",
    "the average  ratio measured by broeils & rhee ( 1997 ) from their sample of galaxies is 0.36@xmath120.47  for all morphological types and 0.32 for i m galaxies .",
    "for a large sample of irregulars roberts & haynes ( 1994 ; see also roberts 1969 ) show a median of about 0.6  for i m galaxies .",
    "ngc 2366 , therefore , appears to be unusually gas rich for its luminosity by a factor of @xmath1124 .",
    "bothun ( 1984 ) has suggested that a better ratio to consider is where l@xmath47 is the luminosity of the galaxy in the h - band within an aperture @xmath48 of @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the size of the galaxy in the optical .",
    "as originally defined , @xmath48 corresponds to a radius of 0.316r@xmath29 where r@xmath29 is close to 25 .",
    "bothun showed that  is a function of the luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "for a galaxy like ngc 2366 with a total m@xmath51 of @xmath217 , the ratio would be expected to be of order 1.8 , and broeils & rhee ( 1997 ) measured an average  of 0.5@xmath120.5 for their sample of galaxies .",
    "instead , we measure the  ratio to be 13 , which is 7 times higher than expected for this luminosity . in this comparison",
    "ngc 2366 is very much more gas - rich than other galaxies for its luminosity .",
    "the integrated hi measurements of spirals used by broeils and rhee from interferometer data agree within a few percent with single - dish observations ( broeils & van woerden 1994 ) and thus it is unlikely that they are missing significant amounts of hi . on the other hand",
    ", their figure 1 shows  increasing with hubble type and they do not include galaxies later than type sd , for which the average  is @xmath111 .",
    "thus , it could be that ngc 2366 is not too unusual for its hubble type , but it is certainly much gassier than sd - type galaxies .",
    "more h - band observations of irregulars are needed to determine how unusual are ngc 2366 and ngc 4449 , also with an unusually high  ( hunter  1995 ) , for their morphological type .      in figure [ fighionha ]",
    "we show contours of hi superposed on our  image .",
    "we see that , with the exception of the two faint  regions to the south of ngc 2363 , star formation is found within an observed hi column density exceeding 2@xmath52 .",
    "the two extreme southern  regions sit within a column density contour of half that .",
    "in addition , the  regions are primarily associated with local peaks in the hi . in particular , most of the  regions lie along the eastern hi ridge .    in figure [ figimvim ]",
    "we compare the hi and  brightnesses of individual pixels in the galaxy , where the   image has been averaged 15@xmath715 pixels in order to approximately match the hi pixel size in the c@xmath6d - array map .",
    "the x - axis of this figure goes from zero to an observed hi column density of 5.2@xmath52 .",
    "the y - axis goes from an luminosity of 7.2@xmath53 ergs s@xmath8 to 1.4@xmath54 ergs s@xmath8 , corrected for reddening ( 1 count in the  image is 1.1@xmath53 ergs s@xmath8 ; we have not converted this to a surface brightness by dividing by the area of the pixel ) .",

    "there is a trend that the highest  luminosities are found at the highest observed hi column densities .",
    "the hi velocity field of ngc 2366 is shown in figure [ figvel ] .",
    "we have fit the velocity field in the following manner .",
    "we began by allowing all parameters to be variables and fitting the entire field with a brandt function . from the resulting solution we fixed the center",
    "these are given in table [ tabpa ] .",
    "we then fit the inner 150  radius of the velocity field with solid body rotation and from that fixed the systemic velocity at 99.1@xmath120.2 .",
    "we did this for inclination angles of 56  and 72  and the two resulting systemic velocities agreed to 2 .",
    "( swaters [ 1999 ] reports a systemic velocity of 104 , and wevers  [ 1986 ] report 98 ) .",
    "we then fit tilted ring models to annuli of 20  width out to a radius of 460 , allowing the inclination , position angle , and rotation speed to vary and trying three different initial guesses .",
    "we found that the receding side , corresponding to the northeast portion of the galaxy , produced more stable solutions than the approaching or southwest side , and emphasis was placed on the receding side in determining the final solution .",
    "in addition the fitting routine was unable to fit the innermost ring .",
    "we also found that beyond a radius of 150  the position angle and inclination were approximately constant .",
    "the variations of position angle and inclination with radius are shown in figure [ figrot ] .",
    "the position angle and inclination were determined from the 150@xmath56r@xmath56460   portion of the fit . finally , we fixed the position angle and inclination and fit the rotation speed again for each annulus using annuli of 20width to a radius of 460  and annuli of 40  width beyond there to 620 .",
    "we also used the higher resolution c - array velocity field to examine the kinematics in the inner 3  with 10  rings .",
    "the uncertainties were higher but the results were essentially the same as for the c@xmath6d - array field .    the final position angle and inclination determined from the hi kinematics are listed with the others determined from the optical and hi morphology in table [ tabpa ] .",
    "we determine an inclination angle of 65and a position angle of 46 .",
    "this can be compared to 58  and 39 , respectively , determined by braun ( 1995 ) from high resolution b - array vla data ; 65  and 40determined by wevers  ( 1986 ) ; and 59  and 42determined by swaters ( 1999 ) ; thus , the agreement is good .",
    "however , the inclination and position angles determined from the hi velocity field are not the same as those found from the optical or hi morphologies .",
    "the morphologies of the stars and gas both give axis ratios that imply an inclination of about 72 , while the fit to the velocity field suggests that the hi is 7  less inclined .",
    "the position angle of the velocity field is also rotated further to the east than the morphology of the stars or gas would suggest by 1422 .",
    "these results indicate that either the hi distribution or the kinematics deviate from axisymmetry .",
    "that is , the hi disk must be either elongated or warped or the motions must be non - circular .",
    "the resulting inclination - corrected rotation curve is shown in figure [ figrot ] ( adopting the inclination of 65  determined from the fit to the velocity field ) , and contours of the model rotation curve are superposed on the velocity field in figure [ figvel ] .",
    "the kinematical center of the gas is shifted 5  to the east and 17  to the north of the center of the outer optical isophotes , but these offsets are less than one beam - width .",
    "one can see in figure [ figvel ] ( and figure [ figvdispha ] below ) that the velocity field is distorted to the southeast of the center of the galaxy , and this causes problems in fitting the approaching side of the velocity field .",
    "this region of the velocity field has no obvious connection with any optical , integrated hi , or velocity dispersion feature .",
    "in fact , the anomalous region is outside the v - band contour shown in figure [ figvel ] .",
    "furthermore , the distortion in the velocity field is not the s - shape of a warp ( bosma 1981 ) .",
    "there is also a distortion to the north of the galaxy center , and the isovelocity contours on the outer west side of the galaxy generally twist to become oriented north - south at the edge of the hi distribution ( see figures [ figvel ] and [ figvdispha ] ) .    in spite of all this",
    "the rotation curve shown in figure [ figrot ] is fairly normal .",
    "it rises like a solid body for approximately the inner 110  ( @xmath260.7r@xmath0 ) , rises less steeply to @xmath111.1r@xmath0 , and then levels off . at a radius of about 340  ( @xmath262.2r@xmath0 ) , the rotation curve begins to fall although the approaching and receding sides behave differently , with the approaching side remaining approximately level .",
    "the maximum rotation speed is 48 .",
    "swaters ( 1999 ) gives a rotation speed of 60  at his last measured radius of 5.9 ; the difference is consistent with his lower value for the inclination .",
    "if the galaxy contains a stellar bar potential , we might expect this to be reflected in velocity field anomalies in the vicinity of the bar  in the isovelocity contours or changes in position angle or inclination ( for example , pisano , wilcots , & elmegreen 1998 ; koribalski  1996 ; ondrechen & van der hulst 1989 ) . in the velocity field ( figures [ figvel ] and [ figvdispha ] )",
    "there is a hint of a position angle greater than 45  for radii less than 1.5 .",
    "this could , if real , be a bar effect .",
    "however , clear and obvious changes in the position angle or inclination with radius that could correspond to the edge of a bar are missing , although the resolution of the c@xmath6d - array data is too low to resolve the inner bar identified in figure [ figallbars ] .",
    "in addition , the velocity field anomalies that we do see are not associated with the optical galaxy .",
    "the velocity field of the c - array data shows more variations everywhere , probably because of the lower signal - to - noise .",
    "and , in the c - array velocity field there is an anomaly at the southwest end of the inner bar , but this is also where the supergiant  complex ngc 2363 is located and it is expected to have an impact on the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) there .",
    "thus , we see no velocity field anomalies that we can convincingly associate with a bar structure .",
    "a bar in ngc 2366 could be more subtle , however .",
    "ngc 2366 is a later type galaxy than is usually studied for bar flows , so we might not see the same kinematic features that are found in other galaxies .",
    "the lmc , for example , is a small system like ngc 2366 , and it has a clear optical bar , but this bar has virtually no signature in the hi intensity and only a mild distortion of the inner hi velocity fields ( kim et al .",
    "1998 ) . in this sense",
    ", it resembles ngc 2366 .",
    "in addition , many late type galaxies tend to look elongated or irregular in outline like ngc 2366 , so it is possible that some of the observed ellipticity in figures [ figouterbar ] and [ figallbars ] is the result of an intrinsically prolate structure .",
    "if this is the case , then what should we expect for non - circular perturbations in the velocity field ?",
    "figure 4 in athanassoula ( 1992 ) shows a model simulation that could be like part of ngc 2366 .",
    "it is for a barred galaxy with no inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) , and it shows a compressed central dust lane that runs almost like a straight line from each end of the bar through the nucleus .",
    "the bar compression does not take the form of two offset dust - lanes with an inner spiral , as in earlier - type galaxies with an ilr .",
    "a straight dust lane in ngc 2366 could account for the central ridge of star formation in figure [ figallbars ] and for the thin inner hi and h@xmath57 streaks in figure [ fighionha ] .",
    "another model with nearly straight dust lanes has a large bar axial ratio ( fig . 6 in athanassoula 1992 )",
    ". such axial ratios also result from the lack of an ilr .",
    "ngc 2366 has a solid body rotation curve in the inner part , as shown in figure [ figrot ] .",
    "this implies that the value of @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the angular rotatino rate and @xmath60 is the epicyclic frequency , is nearly zero there and makes it unlikely there is an ilr , which requires @xmath58 to equal the rotation speed @xmath59 .",
    "thus , the athanassoula simulation seems relevant to ngc 2366 .",
    "the velocities in the athanassoula ( 1992 ) solutions are parallel to the bar in the inner regions , with a convergence and shock near the bar major axis .",
    "such velocities would twist the hi minor kinematic axis away from the optical minor axis in a manner like that seen in figures [ figvel ] and [ figvdispha ] ( middle panel ) .",
    "for example , the southwest side of ngc 2366 is approaching us , so the counter - clockwise twist of the velocity contours in the inner region ( compared with the minor isophotal axis ) indicates more of the same approaching motions to the west of the center than in the east . if ngc 2366 rotates counter - clockwise , so that the near side is in the northwest , then this twist is consistent with a bar whose far end is toward the south , and whose parallel approaching streaming motions are from the far side to the near side in the western part of the disk . in this case , the bar would be twisted slightly clockwise compared to the major axis of the outer part of ngc 2366 . alternatively ,",
    "if ngc 2366 rotated clockwise ( placing the near side in the southeast ) , then the observed twist of the velocity contours would be consistent with a bar whose far end is toward the north , and whose parallel streaming motions are from the far side to the near side in the same western part of the disk . in this case",
    "also , the bar would be twisted slightly clockwise from the major isophotal axis of ngc 2366 . in both cases",
    ", we should look for an optical bar that is slightly offset in the clockwise direction from the orientation of the outer part of ngc 2366 .",
    "this offset might be seen in figure [ figallbars ] .",
    "the contour level at 24.04 mag arcsec@xmath13 shows a twist of the faint optical light in this sense , extending for the same radius as the counter - clockwise twist of the hi velocity contours in figure [ figvdispha ] .",
    "a false - color display of the velocity dispersion map is shown in figure [ figvdispha ] .",
    "within the confines of the optical galaxy , the velocity dispersion of the hi gas is mostly 1220  seen in the c@xmath6d - array map .",
    "this is high compared to the canonical value of 10  found in the quiescent gas of many galaxies including irregulars . in the higher resolution c - array velocity dispersion map , however , we see that most of the hi disk is in fact at 510  dispersion but that the hi ring , including regions without star formation , has dispersions of 1017 .",
    "figure [ figvdispha ] shows a comparison of the velocity dispersion to the v - band and , the velocity field , and the integrated hi by superposing contours in three displays .",
    "one can see that there are regions of high velocity dispersion , 2030 , scattered around the hi disk .",
    "one would expect the velocity dispersion of the neutral gas to be high in regions of star formation . in the supergiant  regions in particular , where there is intense star formation ,",
    "the ionized gas itself is known to have high velocity dispersions ( hunter 1982 ; hunter & gallagher 1990 , 1992 , 1997 ) .",
    "however , figure [ figvdispha ] shows that the regions with the highest velocity dispersions in hi are found outside the regions of star formation and beyond the bright part of the optical galaxy altogether .",
    "in fact the high velocity dispersions are not associated with any obvious feature in the optical or hi .",
    "the only exception is that an `` arm '' of higher velocity dispersion curves around the northern and western sides of the `` knob '' of hi in the northeast part of the galaxy ( see bottom panel of figure [ figvdispha ] and figure [ figgrayfull ] ) .",
    "some regions of high velocity dispersion occur where the velocity contours crowd together , as illustrated in the middle panel of figure [ figvdispha ] .",
    "this is true particularly in the northwest region , where the contours are vertical ( 7@xmath3 23@xmath4 13.4@xmath5 , 69  21  07 ) . in this case ,",
    "part of the high dispersion comes from unresolved systematic motions .",
    "however , in other cases the contribution from rotational motions is small .",
    "for example , profiles of the region of high velocity dispersion to the east of the center of the galaxy ( 7@xmath3 24@xmath4 00.6@xmath5 , 69  1832 ) are shown in figure [ figplcubeast ] .",
    "the line profiles in these regions are simply very broad and in some places double peaked .    the regions of high velocity dispersion not significantly affected by the velocity gradient , especially the spiral - like features in the outer parts of the disk , are more difficult to explain .",
    "they could have a turbulent origin .",
    "figure [ vdcolumn ] shows scans of column density as dashed lines and velocity dispersion as solid lines , taken across the entire disk from east to west .",
    "each scan is averaged in vertical bands that are one beam fwhm wide .",
    "they go through three main regions of high velocity dispersion , which are at the indicated positions : e ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) , n ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ; includes the northwest region as well ) , and sw ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) .",
    "the figure shows a tendency for the velocity dispersion to increase where the column density decreases .",
    "there is nearly a one - to - one correspondence between these opposing variations in the central regions of the galaxy .",
    "this suggests a process where there is some pressure or wave - like communication between the regions .",
    "low density regions have greater wave or turbulent motions than high density regions , in a manner analogous to the turbulent motions in individual clouds .",
    "another factor that can affect line profiles is low signal - to - noise , and the regions with high velocity dispersion are also regions of low hi column density .",
    "it is claimed that noisier profiles , such as one might expect in low intensity regions , will appear broader .",
    "if this were the explanation of the high @xmath17 regions that we see here , then we would expect all regions in the outer parts of the galaxy to have high @xmath17 . yet , in figure [ figvdispha ] we see a few selected regions only with anomolously high @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , figure [ figplcubeast ] shows the profiles in one of these regions , and they are clearly broad even though noisy .",
    "thus , while this effect may be entering in at some level , we believe that these regions of anomolously high @xmath17 and the trend we see in figure [ vdcolumn ] are real .",
    "this anti - correlation between velocity dispersion and hi column density that we find in ngc 2366 is different from what is seen in the scd galaxy ic 342 .",
    "there , over most of the galactic disk @xmath17 is highest where the gas column density is highest ( crosthwaite , turner , & ho 2000 ) .",
    "the exception in ic 342 is the center where @xmath17 peaks and the hi column density drops .",
    "crosthwaite  suggest that in the center of ic 342 some additional gas component is contributing to the total gas surface density . elsewhere in ic 342 ,",
    "the correlation between the surface density and velocity dispersion suggests there is a local source of turbulent energy from gas compression in a density wave or local spiral instability . in ngc 2366",
    ", there are apparently no analogous spiral instabilities .",
    "however , there is another situation in which there is an anti - correlation between a velocity dispersion and hi column density .",
    "that is in the irregular galaxy ngc 4214 . in a comparison of  and hi velocity fields in that galaxy ,",
    "wilcots & thurow ( 2001 ) found that the highest  velocities are those of the diffuse ionized gas , often in regions of low hi column density and holes .",
    "they argue that these are the signatures of outflows fueled by surrounding concentrations of massive stars and accelerated by the steep density gradients into holes .",
    "however , this seems unlikely to explain the regions of high @xmath17 in the hi in ngc 2366 .",
    "although the regions of high @xmath17 in ngc 2366 are located in the outer parts of the galaxy where there is a general density gradient , there are not the concentrations of large numbers of massive stars nearby that are seen in ngc 4214 to supply the mechanical energy input .",
    "the exception is ngc 2363 , of course , but there are pockets of high @xmath17 in ngc 2366 located on the other side of the galaxy from ngc 2363 .",
    "furthermore , in this scenario the high velocity dispersion is in the _ ionized _ gas , not the neutral gas , since the massive stars are ionizing the medium as well .",
    "the current star formation activity of ngc 2366 is dominated by the supergiant  complex ngc 2363 , the scale of which is truly remarkable ( kennicutt , balick , & heckman 1980 ) . star formation appears to have been continuing over a period of time up to 10 myr throughout the complex .",
    "there is spectroscopic evidence of the presence of wolf - rayet stars , indicating an age of 35 myr , if they are normal evolved massive stars , near the brightest part of the nebula ( drissen , roy , & moffat 1993 ; gonzlez - delgado  1994 ) .",
    "star formation over periods of order 10 myr is also what is observed in large  complexes in the lmc such as 30 doradus or constellation iii ( see , for example , discussion by dolphin & hunter [ 1998 ] and references therein ) .",
    "ngc 2363 also has a system of  arcs that form a partial shell 835 pc long along the northeast perimeter of the  complex ( figure [ fign2363 ] ) .",
    "if they represent a shell centered on the brightest nebula in the complex , the diameter of the shell would be 1500 pc ( hunter & gallagher 1990 ) .",
    "spectroscopy shows that the arcs are photoionized ( hunter & gallagher 1997 ) .",
    "in addition to the arcs , there are diffuse filaments of ionized gas 25 times lower in surface brightness that extend from the western - most end of the arcs to the northwest away from the nebula ( hunter , hawley , & gallagher 1993 ) .",
    "these filaments are of order 770 pc long and 60 pc wide .",
    "they extend to 1130 pc from the center of ngc 2363 .",
    "furthermore , high velocity ionized gas with fwhm of 38 and fwzi of 190  is associated with the nebula ; the ionized gas alone has a kinetic energy of 9@xmath67 ergs s@xmath8 ( hunter 1982 , roy  1992 , hunter & gallagher 1997 , martin 1998 ) .",
    "roy  ( 1991 ) argue that there is a 285 pc diameter bubble of gas expanding at 45  in the nebula .",
    "all of this motion of the ionized gas is most certainly a consequence of the concentration of massive stars in the complex .",
    "evidence is seen for at least one supernova remnant ( yang , skillman , & sramek 1994 ) .",
    "we have examined the hi within and around ngc 2363 to look for any relationship to the ionized gas structures and unusual activity in the gas . in figure [ fign2363 ]",
    "we show our  image of ngc 2363 .",
    "one can see the arcs of the partial shell curving around the  region to the northeast and the faint , diffuse filaments trailing away from the nebula to the northwest .",
    "there is also diffuse  emission to the west between ngc 2363 and the giant  region to the west ( numbered iii by drissen  2000 ) .",
    "contours are superposed on the  image from the higher resolution c - array integrated hi map .",
    "one can see that the  region is offset from the hi peak , as is commonly seen ( for example , sextans a : hodge , kennicutt , & strobel 1994 ) .",
    "the  peak is 18  ( 300 pc ) , about one hi beam - width , to the west of the hi peak .",
    "the faint , diffuse filaments to the northwest are entering a region that is a local hi minimum as would be expected if they are part of a champagne flow away from the gas cloud .",
    "the ionized gas arcs to the northeast , on the other hand , cross the hi ridge and there are two minor hi peaks located along the shell as well . where the ridge of hi ends as one moves to the northwest along the arcs",
    "is where the arcs end and the faint , diffuse filaments begin .",
    "kinematically there is some anomaly in the c - array velocity field at ngc 2363 .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ fig2363vel ] where we show contours of the velocity field superposed on our  image . in the vicinity of the  arcs on the northeast side of ngc 2363 the velocities of the hi are lower than one",
    "would expect except for a small pocket were the velocities are higher .",
    "however , the magnitude of these variations is of order 5 , which is less than the velocity dispersion of the gas . in figure [ fign2363plcub ]",
    "we show line profiles across the ngc 2363 region and immediate vicinity .",
    "although a few line profiles are double , most are not .",
    "furthermore , the fwhm of the line profiles in the  region , in the arcs , and in the diffuse filaments are comparable to what is seen throughout the galaxy",
    ".      holes and shells have been found in the hi distributions of various irregular galaxies .",
    "most shells within the optical galaxy are believed to be the consequence of the energy input from massive stars that have recently formed , although non - stellar explanations have been proposed for larger holes , especially those outside the optical galaxy ( wada , spaans , & kim 2000 ) .",
    "shells are seen in the hi distributions of galaxies such as ddo 50 ( puche  1992 ) , ic 10 ( wilcots & miller 1998 ) , and the lmc ( kim  1999 ) . in those galaxies the shells are apparent in the integrated hi maps .",
    "we do not see evidence of shells in our integrated map of ngc 2366 , nor in a careful examination of channel maps and position - velocity plots .",
    "of the 51 shells catalogued in ddo 50 by puche   the diameter ranges from 140 to 1900 pc with an average of 730@xmath12440 pc .",
    "the average size in ic 10 is 160@xmath1240 pc ( wilcots & miller 1998 ) .",
    "if shells were present in ngc 2366 , our resolution of 300 pc@xmath7220 pc ( c - array map ) should have allowed us to detect the largest structures found in ddo 50 . however",
    ", ngc 2366 could contain numerous more modest - sized shells that we would not be able to resolve with these data .",
    "drissen  ( 2000 ) have suggested that  region number iii to the west of ngc 2363 and the ridge of gas that it sits on are actually a satellite galaxy now interacting with ngc 2366 .",
    "they base this idea on the age sequence running from east to west through the ngc 2363 star - forming complex and suggest that the interaction initiated star formation in this region which then spread in a sequential manner .",
    "however , as we have seen , the hi , although having significant peculiarities , is not as peculiar as one might expect in the case of an on - going merger .",
    "morphologically , the two ridges of gas deproject into a lumpy ring of gas that is not particularly unusual in appearance .",
    "further , in this ring the gas complex associated with region iii does not stand out as particularly unusual compared to the ngc 2363 complex .",
    "kinematically , we have noted that there are large - scale peculiarities : the position angle of the kinematical axis is rotated from those of the optical and hi morphology , there is gas extending southwest of ngc 2363 at unusual velocities , and the isovelocity contours on the west side of the galaxy rotate to become almost north - south .",
    "however , we do not see evidence of gas at unusual velocities specifically associated with region iii .",
    "futhermore , similar peculiarities are found in many other galaxies .",
    "thus , while it is possible that the velocity field peculiarities do indicate that ngc 2366 has been disturbed by an outside force sometime in the past , we do not feel compelled by the data to assign  region iii outsider status at this time .",
    "there is evidence for an empirical dependence for local star formation activity within a galaxy that involves a threshold . in a thin , differentially - rotating disk composed of pure gas ( safronov 1960 ) or stars only ( toomre 1964 )",
    ", there is a critical surface density  above which the disk is unstable to ring - like perturbations in the radial direction .",
    "kennicutt ( 1989 ) calculated the critical gas density in this model ( quirk 1972 ) for a sample of normal sc spiral galaxies .",
    "he found that the ratio of observed gas density  to critical gas density  typically exceeds 1 at mid - radius in the optical disk , and then falls with increasing distance from the center of the galaxy ; star formation was not detected beyond the point where  dropped below 0.7@xmath120.2 .",
    "he concluded that in sc galaxies places where @xmath560.7 are too stable to form stars ; interior to this , the gas density exceeds the local threshold for star formation .    motivated by the apparent success of the gravitational instabilities model for spiral galaxies , we explored the applicability of several models to a small sample of irregular galaxies ( hunter , elmegreen , & baker 1998 ; see also hunter & plummer 1996 , meurer  1996 , van zee  1997 ) .",
    "these models included ( 1 ) thin - disk , single - fluid gravitational instabilities , ( 2 ) thick - disk , two - fluid ( stars+gas ) gravitational instabilities , ( 3 ) three - dimensional gravitational instabilities based on a comparison between the local gas volume density and the local galactic virial density , ( 4 ) gravitational instabilities limited by the shear time , which uses a modified  based on the oort shear constant @xmath48 instead of the epicyclic frequency @xmath60 , ( 5 ) the two - phase thermal properties of the ism , and ( 6 ) any of a variety of models , presumably based on triggering or feedback , in which the star formation rate depends on the local stellar density . in addition , we also considered all of these models in a second case where the relative density of dark matter is high in the disks of irregular galaxies , as motivated by the high relative dark matter densities overall ( e.g. carignan & beaulieu 1989 ) .",
    "the resulting critical densities for cloud formation for each of these models were compared with the observed gas surface densities .",
    "the ratio of observed to critical gas density as a function of radius was also compared with the azimuthally - averaged current star formation rate and with the v - band stellar surface brightness , a tracer of star formation integrated over a timescale of @xmath11 1 gyr .",
    "we found that the thin - disk , single - fluid model that works so well for spirals does not work for irregulars .",
    "we found that the ratios of observed to critical gas densities are lower in irregulars than in spiral galaxies by a factor of @xmath68 in all cases but the shear - regulated model , suggesting that the gas is highly stable on large scales against cloud formation .",
    "the absolute criterion based on this model , therefore , predicts that star formation should not be occurring at all in irregulars .",
    "in addition , the relative criterion as a function of radius does not predict the observed star formation edge in the galaxies , nor does it predict the variation in star formation rate from galaxy to galaxy .    in figure [ figsig ]",
    "we show this failure of the models for ngc 2366 as well .",
    "there we plot the deprojected surface densities  and the   for the thin rotating disk gravitational instability model .",
    "the values of  have been determined from , assuming the kinematically - determined inclination of 65 .",
    "if one were to use the inclination of 72  suggested by the morphology , the dominant effect is the @xmath69 in deprojecting the column densities . in that case",
    "the measured surface densities decrease by a factor of @xmath110.7 .",
    "in addition  has been corrected for he ( 0.34@xmath7 ) . including molecular gas is far more difficult ; few irregular galaxies have been adequately mapped , so the spatial distribution of h@xmath70 is not generally known .",
    "instead , we took a globally averaged m@xmath71/m@xmath72 ratio and simply multiplied the hi everywhere by this in order to statistically include h@xmath70 . for the m@xmath71/m@xmath72 ratio we used an average between the smc , where molecular gas is 7% of the hi gas content ( rubio  1991 ) , and the lmc , where the ratio is 30% ( cohen  1988 ) .",
    "that is , the h@xmath70 content was taken to be 0.18@xmath7 .",
    "this correction for the presence of h@xmath70 is clearly unsatisfactory , but at present there is no better information on these galaxies .",
    "thus , we took  to be 1.52@xmath7@xmath44 .",
    "was determined from @xmath73 , where @xmath60 is the epicyclic frequency and @xmath17 is the velocity dispersion of the gas .",
    "we determined @xmath17 as a function of radius by integrating the velocity dispersion map in ellipses of 25width and using a position angle of 46  and an inclination angle of 65 .",
    "the mean velocity dispersion in these ellipses , determined from the c@xmath6d - array map , is about 16  out to a radius of 5 , and declines slowly from there to 10  at a radius of 11.7 .",
    "the values of  in ngc 2366 are typical of the irregulars in our previous study : the maximum in , 0.5 , is still below the star formation cut - off value of 0.7 found by kennicutt ( 1989 ) for spirals .",
    "these failures of the models suggest that other processes are important for cloud and star formation in irregulars , leading us to suggest more local effects .",
    "an obvious mechanism is sequentially triggered star formation driven by the mechanical energy input from concentrations of massive stars resulting in gas density irregularities .",
    "another process is random gas compression from turbulence .",
    "kinematics in i m systems are often dominated by random gas motions which can contribute significantly to the pressure ( for example , gottesman & weliachew 1977 ; tully  1978 ; huchtmeier  1981 ; sargent , sancisi , & lo 1983 ; lo , sargent , & young 1993 ; feitzinger  1981 ) , and in some cases rotation can be insignificant compared to random motions ( young & lo 1996 ) .",
    "both of these processes have a sensitivity to the critical density like the gravitational instability model , but do not involve large - scale instabilities directly .",
    "they could in fact dominate the star formation process when spiral arms are not present or are weak ( see also thornley & wilson 1995 ) .",
    "further evidence that local inhomogeneities in the gas may dominate the star formation process come from the observations that  regions are found near peaks in the gas even when the azimuthally - averaged gas is below the critical threshold density ( van der hulst  1993 ; van zee  1997 ; meurer  1998 ) .",
    "because of the apparent dominance of local inhomogeneities in the gas distribution , we have determined the maximum  at the positions of the  regions in ngc 2366 , . as for ,  uses an inclination angle of 65  to convert from column density to surface density and is corrected to account for the presence of he and , statistically , h@xmath70 .",
    "we have determined the maxima using the c - array maps for the higher spatial resolution ( 300 pc@xmath7220 pc ) they give and have looked for the hi peaks within a beam area or the diameter of the  region , whichever was larger . for most  regions",
    "the beam - size is larger than the  region diameter .",
    "this does not take into account the possibility that the  region is offset from the gas cloud out of which it has formed , nor can it account for destruction of the cloud since the formation of the  region .",
    "the values of   at each  region are shown in figure [ figsig ] along with the  from the thin - disk instability model and the azimuthally - averaged .",
    "we see that the  cover a relatively small range , 1836 m  pc@xmath13 , except in the center ( @xmath560.5r@xmath0 ) and outer ( @xmath431.75r@xmath0 ) galaxy where  are lower .",
    "in fact , the  are comparable to the annular in the inner 0.5r@xmath0 of the galaxy , but beyond @xmath110.75r@xmath0 the  are roughly comparable to .",
    "the transition region corresponds roughly to the radius at which the rotation of the galaxy ceases to be that of a solid body ( inner vertical dashed line ) .",
    "also , star formation does not extend very much beyond the radius where the rotation curve begins to fall ( outer vertical dashed line ) .",
    "the rise and fall of  is similar to the rise and fall of the limiting tidal density in the disk midplane .",
    "the tidal density is @xmath74 for angular rotation rate @xmath59 and radius @xmath75 . in the rising part of the rotation curve",
    ", @xmath76 is small so @xmath77 is small , and in the flat part of the rotation curve , @xmath77 decreases as @xmath78 . to compare this with the observations",
    ", we have to convert @xmath77 into a tidal - limit surface density , @xmath79 .",
    "we multiply @xmath77 by twice the scale height , @xmath80 to get @xmath81 for velocity dispersion @xmath17 .",
    "this quantity , corrected for the presence of he and h@xmath70 as for , is plotted in figure [ figsig ] as crosses .",
    "the general agreement of @xmath79 with  indicates that the peak column densities near the hii regions are not particularly dense , but only at about the tidal limit .",
    "lower density clouds should not bind themselves together well .",
    "the tidal limit in the flat part of the rotation curve is higher than the peak column density , but this is probably a result of our not including stars in the expression for @xmath82 . if we write @xmath83^{0.5}$ ] , then the tidal limit equals the observed  if @xmath84 .",
    "stars in the inner disk lower @xmath79 too , making the clouds there relatively more self - bound .",
    "various people have suggested that , rather than a varying critical density stability criterion , there is a simple constant and universal density threshold for star formation ( gallagher & hunter 1984 ; skillman 1987 ; taylor  1994 ; meurer  1996 ; hunter  1998 ; van zee  1998 ) .",
    "most estimates for this threshold are observed column densities of @xmath85 , which corresponds to an hi surface density ( corrected for inclination of the galaxy ) of 3  in ngc 2366 or  of 5  corrected for he and h@xmath70 . we had also estimated a critical gas density of 3 from azimuthally - averaged  for a sample of irregulars . in ngc 2366",
    "we see that all of the star formation is taking place at surface densities @xmath436  or at an azimuthally - averaged @xmath433 , and the bulk of it is taking place at @xmath4315 . the data for ngc 2366 are not inconsistent with this simple , universal threshold .",
    "additional support for this universal threshold comes from comparing peak column densities in galaxies with different levels of star formation activity .",
    "the caveat , as always , is that the measured column densities depend on the beam - size of the observations relative to the size of the galaxy",
    ". nevertheless , they can give us some indication of differences between galaxies .",
    "in our larger sample of irregulars assembled for purposes of studying star formation processes , there are four galaxies with no measurable star formation activity ( determined from  images ) and with published hi maps given with contour levels . in these four galaxies",
    "the highest observed hi contours are column densities of 17@xmath86 ( lgs3young & lo 1997 ; m81dwa  sargent  1983 ; f564-v3 and f567 - 2de blok , mcgaugh , & van der hulst 1996 ) .",
    "these column densities correspond to deprojected hi surface densities of 0.85 m  pc@xmath13 for these galaxies .",
    "there are also three galaxies in this sample with star formation rates per unit area less than @xmath87 , the lowest non - zero rates measured in this sample , and they have hi contour levels shown to 724@xmath88  ( ddo 52simpson 1995 ; ddo 69young & lo 1996 , note the factor of two difference in n@xmath72 for the two beam sizes that they give ; ddo 216lo  1993 ) .",
    "these column densities correspond to hi surface densities of 210 m  pc@xmath13 .",
    "of three galaxies with somewhat higher star formation rates@xmath89@xmath87 , the highest hi contours are 714@xmath86  ( ddo 105broeils 1992 ; f563 - 1 and f565-v2de blok  1996 ) .",
    "these column densities correspond to hi surface densities of 35 m  pc@xmath13 .",
    "the picture is not clean but suggests that something like an hi surface density of @xmath1125 m  pc@xmath13 , or a , corrected for he and h@xmath70 , of 38 m  pc@xmath13 could be a universal cutoff for massive star formation . of course",
    ", these estimates are based on looking at the contours that enclose the bulk of the star formation and do not refer to the peaks in .",
    "there is good reason for an absolute minimum surface density threshold in irregular galaxies , in addition to whatever other thresholds there might be , and this is the requirement of a cool phase of hi as a precursor to star formation .",
    "the existence of a cool phase depends on the pressure and radiation field . for normal radiation fields in star - forming disks ,",
    "the pressure has to exceed several times 10@xmath90 k @xmath91 for the hi to allow an equilibrium cool phase .",
    "this pressure comes entirely from the disk self - gravity , and depends on the square of the column density . for a  of 8 m  pc@xmath13 , the pressure is @xmath92 k @xmath91 .",
    "lower column - density regions should have their hi only in the warm , low - density phase ( elmegreen & parravano 1994 ; braun 1997 ) .    while it is clear that star formation is dependent on local gas peaks to form stars , to some extent",
    "this is a circular argument .",
    "we know that star formation begins with the formation of a gas cloud , and so it is not at all surprising that local peaks in the gas are where we find  regions . once a gas cloud forms and reaches a certain density , it forms stars .",
    "the larger question is what causes those clouds to form in the first place in irregular galaxies .",
    "large - scale gravitational instabilities do not seem to operate with the same vigor as in giant spiral galaxies , because the gas has a lower ratio of @xmath93 by a factor of 2 .",
    "another mechanism could take over in the absence of strong self - gravity , and that is the rearrangement of gas by the input of mechanical energy from concentrations of massive stars in previous episodes of star formation .",
    "this is the stochastic self - propagating star formation ( sspsf ) model of gerola , seiden , & schulman ( 1980 ; wada , spaans , & kim 2000 ) , based on complex feedback and triggering scenarios .    in ngc 2366",
    "aparicio  ( 1995 ) argue that there is no large - scale propagation between regions seen in color - magnitude diagrams of the stellar populations .",
    "however , their ccd images did not include the redder regions of the galaxy that we see in figure [ figdivbv ] .",
    "the redder stellar population situated in the center of the hi ring which now hosts most of the star formation activity of the galaxy does suggest some sort of propagation from a central point outward .",
    "this is similar to what is seen in the irregular galaxy sextans a ( @xmath26ddo 75 ) : the center of sextans a , where there is an hi minimum , is dominated by older stars ( hoessel , schommer , & danielson 1983 ; aparicio  1987 ; dohm - palmer  1997 ) . outside of the center , the bulk of the star formation is taking place in regions associated with two large hi complexes ( skillman  1988 ) .    without a previous generation of stars ,",
    "star formation still had to begin somehow , and perhaps this is where gravitational instabilities contribute . even with a low ratio @xmath93 , instabilities can still operate when there is energy dissipation ( elmegreen 1991 ; elmegreen 1995 ; gammie 1996 ) , but they operate relatively slowly , at the viscous rate",
    ". this type of slow instability might be more important for irregulars than spirals , because the lack of competition from shear in irregulars means there is a lot of time available .",
    "indeed , most of the visible disk of ngc 2366 has virtually no shear , so cloud - forming instabilities can take a very long time to develop .",
    "dohm - palmer  ( 1998 ) in a study of the stellar populations in the irregular galaxy ddo 155 ( @xmath26gr8 ) noted that the recent star formation is concentrated near the main hi complexes .",
    "they argue that the hi complexes are long - lived objects and that star formation takes place within them over hundreds of myr without destroying the complexes .",
    "the giant complex ngc 2363 could be long - lived too , but the similarity of the peak hi density to the critical tidal density in figure [ figsig ] implies that ngc 2366 , like the other star - forming regions , is not tightly self - bound on a large scale .",
    "a good test of this hypothesis would come from the star formation history of this complex .",
    "if there is a population of stars dating back several hundred million years that is exclusively in ngc 2363 , then the complex may be relatively long lived .",
    "we have presented deep ubvjhk  images and hi maps of ngc 2366 .",
    "we see that the galaxy is a boxy - shaped structure at relatively high inclination .",
    "the optical morphology suggests several bar structures including one in which the whole galaxy is a bar .",
    "however , there is only a weak observational signature of a bar potential in ngc 2366 .",
    "there is an asymmetrical extension of stars along the southwest end of the major axis of the galaxy , and this is where the furthest star - forming regions are found , at a radius of 1.3r@xmath27 .",
    "the colors of the galaxy are approximately constant with radius when averaged azimuthally , but show large - scale structure in ratio images .",
    "the center of the hi ring and a low surface brightness region to the northeast appear to be redder than the rest of the galaxy .",
    "the optical surface photometry is fit with an exponential disk that also applies to the near - infrared surface photometry .",
    "the scale length and central surface brightness of the disk are normal for late - type galaxies .",
    "the star formation activity of the galaxy is dominated by the supergiant  complex ngc 2363 that contains 70% of the total  luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "the global star formation rate for ngc 2366 is , however , only slightly elevated for an i m system , and there is enough gas to last another one or two hubble times at the current rate .",
    "the star formation activity drops off with radius approximately as does the starlight until the outer part of the galaxy is reached and then it drops faster .",
    "we detected hi to a radius of 2.3r@xmath27 at 1.7@xmath40 .",
    "the integrated hi shows two ridges running parallel to the major axis that when deprojected appear as a ring of diameter 5.5 kpc with a central depression and a somewhat redder stellar population , as is seen in some other irregulars .",
    "most of the star formation is found along the eastern of the two ridges , but one major  complex is on the western ridge .",
    "the hi is not centered symmetrically on the optical galaxy .",
    "the azimuthally - averaged surface density of hi is comparable to that of other irregulars in the inner part of the galaxy but drops off slower and extends further in the outer parts .",
    "globally , ngc 2366 is more gas - rich than other irregulars .",
    "the kinematics of the hi are not those of a well - behaved rotating disk .",
    "the velocity field to the southeast of the center of the galaxy and along the western edge especially deviate from a model rotating disk . there could be a weak kinematic signature of a bar tilted clockwise relative to the major axis of the galaxy by a few tens of degrees .",
    "the inclination and position angles derived from the kinematics differ from those derived from the optical and hi morphology by 722 .",
    "there are regions of unusually high velocity dispersion , but these regions are not associated with the optical galaxy or features in the hi .",
    "most regions of high velocity dispersion correspond instead to regions of slightly depressed hi column density , as if there is some continuity from region to region in the turbulent pressure and wave motions of the interstellar medium . within the confines of the optical galaxy ,",
    "the velocity dispersion is higher in the hi ring than in the surrounding disk .",
    "hi clouds have properties like those of clouds in other luminous irregulars .",
    "we did not detect any shell structures in the hi .",
    "the hi around the star - forming complex ngc 2363 is fairly unremarkable with a small velocity anomaly in the vicinity of the  arcs , and the large ionized gas shell appears to be perpendicular to the hi ridge containing the complex .    like in other disk galaxies",
    ", the gas in ngc 2366 is lumpy and star - forming regions are associated with these lumps .",
    "regions are found where the gas surface densities locally exceed 6 .",
    "what causes these clouds to form in the first place ?",
    "ngc 2366 , like other irregulars , has low gas densities relative to the critical gas densities of gravitational instability models , so large - scale gravitational instabilities would operate slowly or not at all",
    ". such a slowness of cloud - forming instabilities may not be as much of a problem for irregular galaxies as it is for giant spirals because of the lack of shear in the irregulars . when shear is low , there is little competition to the growth of giant cloud complexes following turbulent energy dissipation .",

    "<S> we present deep ubvjhk  images and hi maps of the irregular galaxy ngc 2366 . optically , ngc 2366 is a boxy - shaped exponential disk seen at high inclination angle . </S>",
    "<S> the scale length and central surface brightness of the disk are normal for late - type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> although ngc 2366 has been classified as a barred i m galaxy , we do not see any unambiguous observational signature of a bar . </S>",
    "<S> there is an asymmetrical extension of stars along one end of the major axis of the galaxy , and this is where the furthest star - forming regions are found , at a radius of 1.3 times the holmberg radius . </S>",
    "<S> the star formation activity of the galaxy is dominated by the supergiant  complex ngc 2363 , but the global star formation rate for ngc 2366 is only moderately elevated relative to other i m galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the star formation activity drops off with radius approximately as the starlight in the inner part of the galaxy but it drops faster in the outer part .    </S>",
    "<S> there are some peculiar features of the hi distribution and kinematics . </S>",
    "<S> first , the integrated hi shows two ridges running parallel to the major axis that when deprojected appear as a large ring . </S>",
    "<S> second , the velocity field exhibits several large - scale anomalies superposed on a rotating disk ; some of these may be from a weak bar that has no inner lindblad resonance . </S>",
    "<S> third , the inclination and position angles derived from the kinematics differ from those derived from the optical and hi morphology . </S>",
    "<S> fourth , there are regions in the hi of unusually high velocity dispersion , but these regions are not associated with the optical galaxy nor any obvious hi feature </S>",
    "<S> . instead the velocity dispersion correlates with a deficit of hi emission in a manner suggestive of long - range , turbulent pressure equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> in other respects the hi is fairly normal . </S>",
    "<S> the azimuthally - averaged surface density of hi is comparable to that of other irregulars in the inner part of the galaxy but drops off slower and extends further in the outer parts . </S>",
    "<S> the hi around the star - forming complex ngc 2363 is fairly unremarkable .    like in other disk galaxies , </S>",
    "<S> the gas in ngc 2366 is lumpy and star - forming regions are associated with these hi complexes .  </S>",
    "<S> regions are found where the gas densities locally exceed 6 . </S>",
    "<S> this threshold is required to provide a cool phase of hi as a first step toward star formation . </S>",
    "<S> ngc 2366 , like other irregulars , has low gas densities relative to the critical gas densities of gravitational instability models , so large - scale gravitational instabilities operate slowly or not at all . </S>",
    "<S> considering the lack of shear in the optical part of this galaxy , the relative slowness of such instabilities may not be a problem  there is little competition to the slow gravitational contraction that follows energy dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> this differs from the situation in giant spiral disks where the shear time is short , comparable to the energy dissipation time , and strong self - gravity is required for a condensation to grow and dissipate its turbulent energy before it shears away .    </S>",
    "<S> the sub - threshold surface densities are also not unusual if they are viewed using the critical tidal density for gravitational self - binding of a rotating cloud , rather than the critical surface density from the usual disk instability condition . </S>",
    "<S> the peak densities in all regions of star formation are equal to the local tidal densities , giving an agreement between these two quantities that is much better than between the surface density and the critical value . </S>",
    "<S> evidently the large scale gas concentrations are all marginally bound against background galactic tidal forces . this condition for self - binding may be more fundamental than the instability condition because it is local , three - dimensional , and does not involve spiral arm generation as an intermediate step toward star formation .    </S>"
