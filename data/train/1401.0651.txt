    "[ intro ] experimental searches for the lepton - number violating weak process neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath0 decay ) are the most promising approach to determine some of the fundamental properties of neutrinos .",
    "the detection of @xmath0 decay would establish the majorana character of neutrinos and provide information about their absolute mass and hierarchy  @xcite .",
    "ongoing experiments exo  @xcite , kamland - zen  @xcite and gerda  @xcite have recently set impressive lower - limits , well over @xmath4 years , on the half - lives of @xmath5xe and @xmath6ge , and the dozen most favorable nuclei are being explored worldwide  @xcite .",
    "however , an eventual @xmath0 decay detection does not guarantee the precise determination of absolute neutrino masses , because the half - life depends on the transition nuclear matrix elements ( nme ) , @xmath7  @xcite : @xmath8^{-1}=g_{0\\nu}|m^{0\\nu}|^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\langle      m_{\\beta\\beta}\\rangle}{m_{e}}\\right)^{2 } ,   \\label{half_life}\\ ] ] with @xmath9 the electron mass and @xmath10 a well - known phase - space factor  @xcite .",
    "the combination of neutrino masses that appears in @xmath0 decay is @xmath11 , with @xmath12 the neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "nmes have been predicted by different theoretical nuclear structure approaches .",
    "these comprise large - scale shell model ( sm )  @xcite , energy density functional methods ( edf )  @xcite , the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa )  @xcite , and the interacting boson model ( ibm )  @xcite .",
    "however , state - of - the - art nme predictions by these approaches differ up to factor two  @xcite , strongly limiting the precision to which information on neutrino masses would be known in case of a @xmath0 decay measurement .",
    "in addition , the half - lives of experimentally relevant nuclei could be significantly under / overestimated for a given @xmath13 .",
    "a better understanding of the nmes is therefore crucial .",
    "recently , experimental observables relevant for @xmath0 decay have been measured  @xcite , allowing checks for the nuclear structure methods  @xcite , that in some cases resulted in closer nmes between different theoretical approaches  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we follow a complementary approach , studying non - physical @xmath0 decays along isotopic chains in the @xmath1-shell , with sm and edf methods .",
    "although within this region only @xmath2ca is an actual @xmath0 decay candidate , a comparison between methods is better established with systematic calculations .",
    "for instance , systematic edf calculations for the cadmium isotopes provided a better understanding of the role of deformation , pairing and shell effects in @xmath0 decay  @xcite .",
    "systematic studies allow to analyze not only numerical values , but also trends , which are useful to identify similarities and differences between sm and edf .",
    "understanding these is essential to reduce the theoretical uncertainty in the @xmath0 decay nmes .",

    "this method has been extensively used to study several nuclear structure properties throughout the whole nuclear chart ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite for its global performance with an approximate gcm method ) .",
    "one of the advantages of this approach is the explicit calculation of the nmes as a function of the quadrupole deformation of initial and final nuclei .",
    "hence , full shape - mixing and spherical nmes can be compared .",
    "additional degrees of freedom such as fluctuations in the pairing field ( already applied to nmes in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , triaxiality or octupolarity are neglected due to prohibitive computational times .",
    "nevertheless , we do not expect from these improvements any qualitative difference with respect to the analysis presented in this work .",
    "sm calculations are performed in the valence space comprised by the 0@xmath14 , 1@xmath15 , 1@xmath16 and 0@xmath17 orbitals ( @xmath1 shell ) , on top of a @xmath18ca core .",
    "we employ the well - known kb3 g  @xcite and gxpf1a  @xcite effective interactions , which have been shown to describe well the nuclear structure of @xmath1 shell nuclei  @xcite .",
    "while the configuration space is significantly smaller in sm than in edf calculations , the main advantage of the sm approach is that all possible correlations within this space are included .",
    "the effect of the reduced sm valence space has been recently studied in the framework of many - body perturbation theory  @xcite , with moderate increases in the nmes . here",
    "we neglect these corrections .",
    "truncated calculations can be performed limiting the number of neutrons and protons not coupled in @xmath19 pairs ( seniority truncations )  @xcite , enabling the study of the correlations associated to high - seniority components .",
    "in addition , sm states obtained in the full @xmath1 shell have good isospin quantum number , and projection to good isospin can be performed for truncated calculations .",
    "the sm code nathan  @xcite has been used throughout this work .      with the initial and final states obtained with the edf and sm methods , we calculate the @xmath0 decay nmes as described in refs .",

    "here we focus on the main nme component @xmath23 , and discuss @xmath24 in the context of isospin conservation .",

    "the gt and f parts of the nmes follow the transition operator evaluated between the initial and final states : @xmath27 + with @xmath28 + where @xmath29 is the isospin - lowering operator that transforms neutrons into protons , and @xmath30 are the pauli spin matrices . the neutrino potentials @xmath31 depend on the relative distance between the two decaying nucleons , @xmath32 , the mass number @xmath33 , and the closure energy @xmath34 . here",

    "a detailed form of the neutrino potentials can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in addition , short - range correlations are included within the ucom framework  @xcite .",
    "other prescriptions have been recently proposed  @xcite , but the differences are small , and not relevant for the purpose of this work .    here",
    "we neglect two - body currents , related to the effective quenching of the @xmath36 operator  @xcite in weak decays , and restrict to a purely two - body operator derived from one - body currents only . while two - body current contributions may be important for the absolute value of the nmes  @xcite , including them would not alter the main conclusions of this study .",
    "[ results ]    with the transition operator described in sec .",
    "[ theo_frame ] , identical for sm and edf calculations , we can make a direct comparison between the nmes obtained by both approaches .",
    "we have calculated the nmes for the @xmath0 decay of the ca , ti and cr isotopic chains .",
    "the gt parts of the nmes are compared in fig .",
    "[ full_nme ] for sm and edf calculations . as in the case of actual @xmath0 decay candidates  @xcite ,",
    "the sm nmes are about half of the edf values . moreover ,",
    "this difference is independent on the particular interaction used . for the sm ,",
    "results with two effective interactions , kb3 g and gxpf1a , are shown , with differences of around @xmath37 .",
    "this agrees with and extends previous studies in the pf shell restricted to @xmath2ca  @xcite . for the edf",
    ", we have also calculated nmes with the gogny d1 m functional , which results in very small differences with respect to the gogny d1s .",
    "figure  [ full_nme ] also reveals that the trends along the isotopic chain are similar in sm and edf calculations .",
    "in particular , relative maxima are found in the decays of mirror nuclei : @xmath38ca@xmath39ti , @xmath40ti@xmath41cr and @xmath42cr@xmath43fe , in agreement with refs .",
    "maxima are more marked in sm calculations , where the initial and final states share the same isospin quantum number , @xmath44 . in the sm case the two states are exactly isospin - symmetric , because coulomb and isospin - symmetry - breaking terms in the nuclear interaction are neglected , but the overlap between mirror initial and final states is also maximal in the edf approach , which includes the coulomb term . for edf calculations",
    ", however , @xmath44 is not a good quantum number .    the configuration space and nuclear correlations included in sm and edf calculations are very different , with the sm being able to take into account more general correlations but in a rather limited valence space .",
    "regarding the size of the configuration space it is important to note that in the pf shell the sm includes all orbitals with their corresponding spin - orbit partner .",
    "this is relevant because in the @xmath0 decay of heavier nuclei , some spin - orbit partners are not included in sm calculations , and this has been pointed out as a possible cause of the relatively small sm nmes .",
    "the sm calculations analyzed in this work are thus free from this shortcoming .",
    "we can get more insight in the comparison of sm and edf nmes by simplifying the nuclear structure correlations present in the initial and final states of the @xmath0 decay .",

    "only configurations with zero seniority ( @xmath45 ) are permitted , this is , protons and neutrons are coupled in @xmath19 pairs -no proton - neutron @xmath19 pairs are included .",
    "we observe that the gt parts of the nmes calculated in these simplified schemes are significantly larger than in the full calculation for both approaches , with an striking agreement between sm and edf nmes . indeed",
    "sm gxpf1a calculations lie within @xmath46 from edf values , while sm kb3 g calculations are about @xmath47 larger .",
    "the difference between the two sm results stems from the different @xmath19 , @xmath48 pairing . as shown in fig .",
    "[ full_nme ] , this difference between effective interactions is washed out when full calculations are performed .",
    "the agreement between sm and edf nmes is in strong contrast with the full nme calculations shown in fig .",
    "[ full_nme ] , where sm nmes were half of the edf values .",
    "this implies that the spherical edf and seniority - zero sm calculations , while conceptually very different , capture approximately the same physics , leaving out the nuclear structure correlations that reduce the @xmath0 decay nmes . these have been identified in refs .",
    "@xcite as the correlations associated with high - seniority components in the sm , and collective deformation effects in edf calculations .",
    "figure  [ sph_nme ] also shows that the trends followed by the nmes calculated in both approaches are very similar , and indeed they follow to a good approximation the generalized seniority scheme in a single shell  @xcite : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the number of proton ( neutron ) pairs in the shell , @xmath51 the pair degeneracy and @xmath52 coefficients characteristic of a major shell .",
    "deviations from eq .",
    "( [ gs ] ) are due to non - perfect shell closures and the @xmath33 dependence in the neutrino potentials .",
    "the `` inverted parabola '' from initial number of neutrons @xmath53 to @xmath54 , common to all cases , shows the filling of the neutron @xmath14 orbital associated to the shell closure at neutron number @xmath55 .",
    "the rather `` flat '' behavior between @xmath54 to @xmath56 is governed by the filling of the @xmath15 orbital , associated with the closure at @xmath57 . at this point , nmes obtained with the sm gxpf1a interaction decrease , due to the filling of the @xmath16 orbital associated with the @xmath58 closure , while the sm kb3 g and edf results , which do not predict such a closure , increase . in all cases the nmes at @xmath59 are larger because the @xmath17 orbital is starting to get filled .",
    "furthermore , eq .  ( [ gs ] ) predicts that due to the filling of the proton @xmath14 shell ( @xmath60=4 ) , the nmes for ti and cr decays ( @xmath61 ) to be the same , as observed in fig .",
    "[ sph_nme ] .",
    "the fact that both seniority - zero sm and spherical edf calculations agree with the generalized seniority scheme , and result in very similar nmes , opens up the door to benchmarking also nmes calculated with other nuclear structure methods , such as qrpa or ibm , which using similarly simplified initial and final states should also agree with the results of fig .",

    "the reduction is maximal at @xmath69 nuclei , but very minor in the most neutron - rich systems .",
    "the correlations associated to high - seniority components in the initial and final states are the responsible for the strong reduction of @xmath23 , and these correlations also wash out the trend which appears with seniority - zero initial and final states .",

    "a step further , beyond the scope of this work , would include on equal footing both pair - breaking mechanisms into the gcm framework , and study their influence in the nmes .",

    "<S> we calculate the nuclear matrix elements ( nmes ) for neutrinoless double - beta decays ( @xmath0 ) of @xmath1-shell nuclei using the shell model ( sm ) and energy density functional ( edf ) methods . </S>",
    "<S> the systematic study of non - physical decays ( except for @xmath2ca ) of ca@xmath3ti , ti@xmath3cr and cr@xmath3fe allows for a detailed comparison between the two nuclear structure approaches . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that while the dominant gamow - teller part of the nme differs roughly by a factor of two between sm and edf , when we restrict the calculations to spherical edf states and seniority - zero sm configurations , the nmes obtained by both methods are strikingly similar . </S>",
    "<S> this points out to the important role of nuclear structure correlations for @xmath0 decay nmes . </S>",
    "<S> we identify correlations associated with high - seniority components in the initial and final states of the decay as one of the reasons for the discrepancies between sm and edf results . </S>",
    "<S> we also explore exact projection to good isospin , and conclude that it has only a moderate effect in the gamow - teller part of the nmes but strongly affects the fermi contribution . </S>",
    "<S> this work opens up the door for nme benchmarks between different theoretical approaches , and constitutes a step forward towards more reliable estimations of the nmes . </S>"
