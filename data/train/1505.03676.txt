    "in this paper , we present a two - dimensional model of a porous medium that consists of a squared container partially filled with a liquid and where the pore throats are formed by fixed circular grains that are uniformly distributed .",
    "we analyse in probabilistic terms the structure of the stationary interfaces that separate the liquid from air .",
    "we consider several parameter regimes where , essentially , either gravity or capillarity dominates .    in this model the form of the interfaces , both at the pore scale and at the macro scale ,",
    "is determined by the balance between gravity and capillary forces . for a given volume of liquid ,",
    "these interfaces are the union of single interfaces ( see @xcite ) that meet the solid matrix at given contact angles following young s law ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the quasi - stationary system seems to evolve by means of a sequence of local minimizers of the energy .",
    "the energy for steady states is the sum of surface energy and potential gravitational energy .",
    "the contact angle conditions can be encoded in the different interfacial energies .",
    "one of the most relevant features in these flows is the existence of a large number of equilibria that are local minimizers of the total energy of the system . in quasi - stationary situations , if the volume of the liquid phase changes slowly , transitions occur between different minimizers .",
    "understanding the evolution of such a system would require the description of the global motion of the interface that explains the jumps between these multiple local energy minimizers .",
    "a first step towards this goal consists in understanding the structure of the minimizers .",
    "the aim of this paper is thus to describe the structure of equilibrium interfaces for different parameter regimes in the model described above .",
    "there are several characteristic lengths in the problem , namely , the distance between grains , their size , as well as the macroscopic size of the system . on the other hand , there are other length scales ( the capillary length and the inverse of the bond number ) that , as we shall see , give the distances where surface tension and gravity balance ( typically , surface tension dominates for small distances and gravity for large ones ) .",
    "this study is motivated by the experiments presented in furuberg - maloy - feder @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the authors reproduced haines jumps ( see @xcite ) in a slow drainage process in a container consisting of two plates separated by thin cylinders that act as obstacles or ` grains ' .",
    "we recall that haines jumps are abrupt changes of the pressure in the liquid phase due to sudden changes in the geometry of the interface . from the mathematical point of view",
    "these jumps seem to correspond to a fast transition from one equilibrium state to a different one in the capillarity equations .",
    "we mention that there are several mathematical studies related to the study of multiphase flow in porous media .",
    "however , much of the mathematical analysis has focused on the qualitative study of semi - empirical macroscopic descriptions of these flows ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there are also rigorous results concerning the derivation of such macroscopic laws from the flows taking place at the pore scale .",
    "not surprisingly , such attends are restricted to single - phase flow ( see the chapter of @xcite , @xcite ) or simplified models mimicking essential features of multi - phase flow ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "although our model falls into the second category , we believe that one can analyse simple , but not phenomenological , models in probabilistic terms to get a better understanding of the effect that processes at the pore scale have in the whole system . in this regard , our work is also related to for example @xcite ( and the references therein ) , where the propagation of fronts through a random field of obstacles is analysed in relation to hysteresis .    in the next section we set up the mathematical model and discern the parameter regimes under consideration .",
    "we outline the contents of the paper at the end of this introduction .",
    "we consider a two dimensional rectangular container of length @xmath0 that contains @xmath1 uniformly distributed circular grains . if the average distance between grains is @xmath2 ( understood as the average of the distances of every center to its nearest neighbour ) , then @xmath3 . we then let @xmath4 represent the density of grains , i.e. @xmath5 satisfies @xmath6 . we assume , for simplicity , that all grains are of equal size and we denote by @xmath7 their radius",
    ".    the container is partially filled with a liquid so that an interface forms separating the liquid from the air .",
    "we assume that such an interface splits the domain in two regions , i.e. it does not intersect itself and there are no isolated bubbles of either of the fluid phases .",
    "let us denote by @xmath8 the curve that joins grains and forms the interface , that is the union of capillary(-pressure ) curves @xmath9 joining every two grains that meet the interface and that we call _ elemental components _ of @xmath8 .",
    "a sketch of this setting is shown in figure  [ basic : setting ] .",
    "let us fix the canonical basis @xmath10 such that @xmath11 and @xmath12 , then @xmath13 points in the opposite direction to the gravitational field .",
    "we shall denote the coordinates of a point @xmath14 by @xmath15 in this basis .",
    "every elemental component of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , satisfies the capillary equation ( e.g. @xcite ) @xmath16 that must be complemented with young s condition at the grains and/or the walls of the container .",
    "we shall assume that the contact angle is the same at all solid surfaces .",
    "here @xmath17 denotes the signed curvature of each @xmath9 that forms @xmath8 , @xmath18 is the ( constant ) density of the liquid , @xmath19 is the gravity constant and @xmath20 denotes surface tension . here",
    "@xmath21 is the pressure associated to the volume fraction of the domain ( including grains ) , @xmath22 , occupied by the liquid . then @xmath23 we take as unit of length the average distance between the grains of the system , @xmath24 .",
    "up - scaling the length variables with @xmath24 , we obtain that @xmath8 satisfies the non - dimensional equation @xmath25 subject to a contact angle boundary condition that we specify below .",
    "we obtain the non - dimensional number @xmath26 , which is the bond number @xmath27 and measures the balance between gravitational forces and surface tension in this units of length .    for simplicity",
    ", we use the same notation for the non - dimensional variables .",
    "also we let @xmath0 and @xmath28 be the non - dimensional size of the domain ( i.e. @xmath29 ) and grain radius ( i.e. @xmath30 ) , respectively .",
    "this , in particular , means that , with this notation , @xmath31 in ( [ s1e1 ] ) .",
    "we observe that @xmath32 depends on the configuration of grains , so if we let @xmath33 $ ] be the volume fraction of the domain occupied by the liquid , the volume occupied by the liquid is @xmath34 and then @xmath35 is the volume below the interface @xmath8 , if @xmath36 is the number of grains below @xmath8 .",
    "we assume thereafter that @xmath37 is fixed , and we take the horizontal line @xmath38(@xmath39 ) as a reference height for each configuration of grains .",
    "observe that this is a solution of ( [ s1e1 ] ) with @xmath40 at the walls .",
    "we also observe that with the new notation , where @xmath0 and @xmath28 are non - dimensional lengths , then the number of grains in the container is @xmath41 .",
    "henceforth , with this scaling we can think of the equivalent problem where the liquid and air occupy some space in a square domain @xmath42^{2}$ ] with @xmath43 , where @xmath44 grains are uniformly distributed with an average distance @xmath45 between them .",
    "we indicate the position of a center by the variable @xmath46 and write its boundary in the form @xmath47 .",
    "we take @xmath48 as the unit normal vector to @xmath8 pointing in the direction of air , and @xmath49 the tangent vector to @xmath8 such that @xmath50 has the same orientation as the canonical basis ( i.e. that @xmath51 ) .",
    "let us denote by @xmath52 the outer normal vector to @xmath47 at a point @xmath53 where @xmath8 and @xmath47 intersect ( i.e. @xmath53 is a contact point ) . let us denote by @xmath54 the value of @xmath49 at @xmath53 .",
    "then , the young condition is defined as follows : if @xmath55 , @xmath56 where @xmath57 $ ] is the contact angle and where @xmath58 . if @xmath59 , then with the same choice of @xmath60 , we set @xmath61",
    ".    we shall distinguish different parameter regimes .",
    "the following observations are then in order .",
    "we recall that @xmath26 is the bond number with respect to the scale given by the distance between grains . in the case",
    "@xmath62 the gravitational effects are the dominant ones . in this limit",
    "the liquid - gas interfaces tend to be horizontal lines , corrected by boundary layers of height @xmath63 . in the limit @xmath64 ,",
    "the interfaces are dominated by surface tension and this allows vertical variations in the connection between grains ( of the order of the distance between the grains ) .",
    "thus , unlike in the case @xmath62 , if @xmath64 the connections can take place in any direction , not just horizontally .",
    "the above regimes take into account the size of @xmath26 only , but we shall relate it to @xmath0 as well . in particular , the limit @xmath65 gives an ever increasing number of grains and can in principle give rise to anomalous situations ( not sketched above ) that we analyse in detail in section  [ sec : stoch ] and that we summarise below .",
    "we distinguish several cases depending on the relative size of @xmath26 and @xmath0 . in the cases",
    "where @xmath62 , we actually compare @xmath0 to @xmath66 , which relates the height of the boundary layers to @xmath28 :    1 .",
    "* the regime @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( section  [ regime:1 ] theorem  [ theo : case1 ] ) : * in this case gravity dominates and the size of the container is not sufficiently large to allow significant capillarity effects .",
    "we find that as @xmath70 there are configurations with probability close to @xmath45 for which the solution interfaces tend to the horizontal solution .",
    "one can in fact distinguish the cases @xmath71 and @xmath72 , with either @xmath73 or @xmath74 , with the same result .",
    "* the regime @xmath75 and @xmath72 ( section  [ regime:2 ] theorem  [ theo : case2 ] ) : * in this case we find that the probability of finding solutions close to the horizontal line is close to one . on the other hand we also find that the probability of finding configurations that have a given number of elemental components is close to zero , but bounded from above by a poisson distribution .",
    "again , the distinction between the cases @xmath76 and @xmath77 is not significant .",
    "the regime @xmath78 and @xmath65 : * 1 .   * the case @xmath68 ( and @xmath69 ) ( section  [ regime:3 ] theorem  [ theo : case3])*. this is a regime where gravity in principle dominates , we find an interval of @xmath0 in terms of @xmath26 where with probability close to one solutions stay in a narrow strip around the horizontal reference line . for @xmath0 above this range",
    "there is no guarantee that solutions are necessarily close to the horizontal reference line . if @xmath76 , the interval is @xmath79 , and if @xmath77 with @xmath69 , the result holds replacing @xmath63 by @xmath28 .",
    "* the case @xmath80*. in this case , capillary and gravity forces are comparable and it is not possible to derive general properties about the structure of the solution interfaces using perturbative methods .",
    "therefore this regime is not included in our analysis .",
    "3 .   * the case @xmath81 ( section  [ regime:4 ] theorem  [ percolation : theo])*. we will see that in this case the only meaningful limit is that of @xmath82 . when @xmath81 , the maximum fluctuation of height of a solution @xmath8 are of the order of @xmath83 .",
    "in this regime , we can show that with probability close to one , we can find interfaces that are suitably close to any smooth curve without self - intersections that connect ( following its orientation ) @xmath84 $ ] to @xmath85 $ ] .",
    "in order to understand the probabilistic problem we need to analyse the elemental components that an interface @xmath8 can have .",
    "this is done in section  [ sec : construction1 ] where we analyse the solution curves of ( [ s1e1 ] ) and characterise them in terms of a free parameter that controls the height reached by the curve and its curvature .",
    "in fact , equation ( [ s1e1 ] ) implies that the curvature of an elemental component increases in absolute value with the distance to the reference height .",
    "the main results and their proofs are presented in section  [ sec : stoch ] , where the regimes outlined above are studied separately .",
    "finally , appendix  [ sec : proofgeolemma ] deals with the proof of a technical lemma that is needed in section  [ regime:3 ] .",
    "in this section we analyse the basic features of elemental components of an interface @xmath8 .",
    "we first observe that equation ( [ s1e1 ] ) in the absence of boundary conditions can be solved explicitly in terms of elliptic integrals , see @xcite .",
    "one can achieve this by first introducing the variable @xmath86 and using the angle @xmath87 $ ] from @xmath60 to the tangent vector @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the arc - length . then multiplying ( [ s1e1 ] ) by @xmath90 and integrating once we get @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a constant of integration that can have either sign or be zero , but clearly @xmath93 .",
    "then solving ( [ s1e1 ] ) , with given initial conditions , amounts to solving @xmath94 subject to the same initial conditions , together with ( [ a1e1 ] ) and a compatible constant @xmath92 .",
    "the are the obvious symmetries of equation ( [ s1e1 ] ) , @xmath95 ( for any @xmath96 ) and @xmath97 , that will be used to simplify the computations below .    using ( [ t : beta : rela ] ) and the definition of arc - length , one can write ( [ a1e1 ] ) as @xmath98   \\left ( dx_{1}\\right )   ^{2}=\\left (   c - b\\frac{\\bar{x}_{2}^{2}}{2}\\right )   ^{2}\\left ( d\\bar{x}_{2}\\right )   ^{2 } \\label{a1e2}\\ ] ] the fact that we are taking squares to go from ( [ s1e1 ] ) to ( [ a1e2 ] ) means that the set of solutions of the latter is larger than that of the former . in the construction one",
    "has to impose that the resulting curves are indeed solutions of ( [ s1e1 ] ) , as we shall see .",
    "we also notice that all solutions must have @xmath99 .",
    "below , we find the solutions of ( [ s1e1 ] ) by gluing together pieces of curve solutions that are graphs of a function of the form @xmath100 and that solve ( [ a1e2 ] ) .",
    "we then integrate ( [ a1e2 ] ) after taking the positive or negative square root of @xmath101 ; we use the equations:@xmath102 observe that @xmath103 , for such graphs , is characterised by @xmath104    there are solutions , however , that can not be constructed the way explained above .",
    "these are the solutions with @xmath105 , that is the curves @xmath106 ( air is on top of the liquid ) and @xmath107 ( air is below the liquid ) .",
    "the former corresponds to a solution of ( [ a1e1 ] ) with @xmath108 , and the latter to a solution of ( [ a1e1 ] ) with @xmath109 .",
    "next , we identify the points of the solution curves where either @xmath110 or @xmath111 , i.e. the values of @xmath112 where either the left or the right - hand side of ( [ a1e2 ] ) vanishes . for simplicity",
    ", we use the following notation : @xmath113 and @xmath114    [ hori : vert : points ] the points at which either @xmath110 or @xmath111 are as follows :    1 .   if @xmath115 , when @xmath110 then @xmath116 , and when @xmath117 then either @xmath118 or @xmath119 , except if @xmath120 , that @xmath117 only occurs at @xmath119 .",

    "if this solution reaches a point with @xmath110 then it can only be continued further by solving the same branch of ( [ dx1:dx2 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the curve reaches a point with @xmath111 then it can only be continued further by solving the branch equation with opposite sign .",
    "a solution stops being a graph of a function of the form @xmath100 when , seen as a curve , @xmath111 .",
    "it is easy to see that , this never occurs at a point with @xmath125 . at those points",
    "we can further continue the solution curve by gluing smoothly with another solution curve that solves ( [ dx1:dx2 ] ) with the opposite sign ( notice that these curves , as graphs , have the opposite orientation , and hence the change of sign in ( [ dx1:dx2 ] ) implies that they have the same curvature at that point ) .",
    "on the other hand , at points with @xmath110 , the solution is still a graph , and in principle , one could glue it to a solution that solves ( [ dx1:dx2 ] ) with the opposite sign . however , if this happens at a point with @xmath126 , then @xmath17 would change sign , which contradicts ( [ s1e1 ] ) .",
    "if , this happens at a point with @xmath125 , then @xmath17 keeps its sign , but this also contradicts ( [ s1e1 ] ) .",
