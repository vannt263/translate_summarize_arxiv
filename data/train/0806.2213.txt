    "the qcd sum rules method @xcite , proposed about three decades ago , is one of the powerful methods for investigating the properties of hadrons .",
    "this method has been extensively used as an efficient tool to study the masses , decay form factors and so on @xcite . in recent years",
    "there has been increasing interest in the modification of hadronic properties at finite temperature in order to understand the results of the heavy ion collision experiments .",
    "the qcd sum rules method is extended to the finite temperature in @xcite and finite temperature sum rules have several new features .",
    "one of them is the interaction of the current with the particles of the medium .",
    "this effect requires modifying hadron spectral function .",
    "the other novel feature is the breakdown of lorentz invariance by the choice of reference frame @xcite-@xcite . due to the residual o(3 )",
    "symmetry more operators with the same dimension appear in the operator product expansion ( ope ) at finite temperature compared to those at zero temperature .",
    "taking into account both complications , the investigation of ope for thermal correlator of the two vector currents , and the thermal qcd sum rules for vector mesons have been realized in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "also , nuclear medium modifications of meson parameters are widely discussed in the literature @xcite-@xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we investigate the properties of the scalar @xmath0 meson in the framework of thermal qcd sum rules .",
    "the basic idea of thermal qcd sum rules is to get information about temperature dependence of hadron parameters , studying the same correlator , both at high temperature where the quark - gluon plasma is expected and at low temperature , where the hadronic phase is dominated .",
    "note that the nature of light scalar mesons is still an open problem and is the subject of intensive and continuous theoretical @xcite and experimental investigations @xcite .",
    "can we get any new information about the nature of the scalar mesons from the thermal qcd analysis ?",
    "present work is addressed to the investigation of this problem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we derive the thermal qcd sum rules for scalar @xmath1 meson . in section 3",
    "we present our numerical calculations .",
    "this section also contains discussion and our conclusion .",
    "in this section we construct the thermal sum rules for scalar @xmath1 meson . for this purpose",
    "we consider the thermal average of correlation function @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the interpolating current with the @xmath0 meson quantum numbers .",
    "the thermal average of any operator is determined by following expression @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the qcd hamiltonian , and @xmath6 stands for the inverse of the temperature @xmath7 and traces are carried out over any complete set of states .",
    "the fundamental assumption of wilson expansion is that the product of operators at different points can be expanded as the sum of local operators with momentum dependent coefficients in the form : @xmath8 where @xmath9 are called wilson coefficients , and @xmath10 are a set of local operators .",
    "in this expansion , the operators are ordered according to their dimension @xmath11 .",
    "the lowest dimension operator with @xmath12 is the unit operator associated with the perturbative contribution . in the vacuum sum rules operators with dimensions",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 composed of quark and gluon fields are the quark condensate @xmath15 and the gluon condensate @xmath16 , respectively . at finite temperature lorentz invariance",
    "is broken by the choice of a preferred frame of reference , and therefore new operators appear in the wilson expansion . in order to restore lorentz invariance in thermal field theory , four - vector velocity of the medium @xmath17",
    "is introduced . using four - vector velocity and quark / gluon fields",
    ", we can construct a new set of low dimension operators @xmath18 and @xmath19 with dimension @xmath14 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are fermionic and gluonic parts of energy momentum tensor @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "so , we can write thermal correlation function in terms of operators up to dimension four : @xmath23 the wilson coefficients in eq.([eqn4 ] ) are calculated in @xcite , and renormalization group improved expression of ope leads to the following result @xmath24,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the euclidean momentum , @xmath26^{-\\delta / b}$ ] and @xmath27 . at one loop level",
    "the constants @xmath28 and @xmath29 are given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is quark flavours number .",
    "the spectral representation for the correlation function in @xmath32 at fixed @xmath33 can be written as @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 note that , the subtraction terms are removed by the borel transformation . for this reason in further discussion",
    "we omit these terms .",
    "equating spectral representation and ope , and performing borel transformations with respect to @xmath36 from both sides eq.([eqn7 ] ) , we obtain the qcd sum rules @xmath37\\,\\ , , \\\\\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is borel parameter , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the non - perturbative contributions of higher dimensional operators , @xmath41 @xmath42\\,\\ , .   \\\\\\ ] ] now we consider the phenomenological part of the correlation function",
    ". we shall work below the critical temperature , where the physical spectrum is saturated by hadrons . in this case ,",
    "similar to the vacuum qcd sum rules , the dominant contribution to the spectral density comes from @xmath0 mesons .",
    "we also calculate the contribution of the non - resonant two - pion continuum .",
    "let us calculate @xmath0-pole contribution to the correlator .",
    "the leptonic decay constant @xmath43 of the @xmath0-meson is given by , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is @xmath0-meson mass .",
    "in thermal field theory , the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath43 must be replaced by their temperature dependent values .",
    "the vacuum value of the leptonic decay constant is obtained from two point qcd sum rules and @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the absorptive part of the correlation function is calculated by using the following field - current identity @xmath47 and @xmath0-meson contribution to thermal correlator can be written as @xmath48 here @xmath49 is the time ordered product of two @xmath0-meson fields ( 11-component of the finite temperature scalar field propagator with mass @xmath45 in the real time formalism ) and has the following form @xcite-@xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the bose distribution function , @xmath52^{-1}$ ] and @xmath53 .",
    "the imaginary part of correlation function can be simply evaluated using the formula @xmath54 , which leads to @xmath55 with the help of @xmath28-function we obtain the following result for @xmath0-pole contribution to the spectral function @xmath56 in order to calculate the dependence of @xmath45 and @xmath43 on temperature , we consider appropriate loop diagrams .",
    "let us calculate the @xmath57-contribution to the amplitudes , which describes the interaction of the current with the particles in the medium .",
    "this contribution to the correlation function can be written as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the 11-component of the finite temperature propagator for pions and @xmath60 @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the integration over @xmath61 in eq.([eqn17 ] ) can be evaluated using the residue theorem . after integration and some simplifications for the imaginary part of the correlation function",
    "we obtain @xmath62 where , @xmath63 at values @xmath64 and @xmath65 the terms involving the density distributions can be written as @xmath66 \\tanh \\left ( \\frac{\\beta q_0}{2}\\right ) = \\left ( n_1+n_2 + 1\\right ) \\,\\ , , \\\\\\ ] ] @xmath67 \\tanh \\left ( \\frac{\\beta q_0}{2}\\right ) = \\left(n_2-n_1",
    "\\right ) \\,\\ , , \\ ] ] respectively .",
    "as can be seen , delta function @xmath68 in eq.([eqn18 ] ) gives the first branch cut , @xmath69 , which coincides with zero temperature cut that describes the standard threshold for particle decays . on the other hand , delta function @xmath70 in eq.([eqn18 ] ) shows that an additional branch cut arises at finite temperature , @xmath71 , which corresponds to particle absorption from the medium .",
    "therefore , delta functions @xmath68 and @xmath70 in eq.([eqn18 ] ) contribute in regions @xmath69 and @xmath71 , respectively . taking into account both contributions ,",
    "the spectral function can be written as @xmath72 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\delta \\left ( q^2 - 2 q_0 \\omega_1 + 2|\\textbf{k}||\\textbf{q}|\\cos \\theta \\right)\\,\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the integration over angle @xmath73 in eq.([eqn22 ] ) can be evaluated using the constraint @xmath74 , which leads to following inequality latexmath:[\\[\\label{eqn23 } \\frac{|q^2 - 2q_0 \\omega_1|}{2|\\textbf{k}|    @xmath69 give us the integration range of @xmath76 as @xmath77 , where @xmath78 @xmath79 at @xmath71 the region of variation of @xmath80 must be @xmath81 .",
    "finally , the thermal spectral function can be written as @xmath82 changing the variable @xmath76 to @xmath83 given by @xmath84 , we finally get the two pion contribution to the spectral function as @xmath85 @xmath86\\,\\ , , \\,\\,\\,\\ , q^2\\leq 0\\ ] ] the qcd sum rules are obtained by equating theoretical and phenomenological parts of correlation function . taking into account of expressions eq.([eqn27 ] ) and eq.(28 ) in eq.([eqn9 ] ) we get @xmath87 as the temperature approaches to zero , the two terms in bracket go to zero and the thermal average of the operators on the right become the expectation values , recovering the vacuum sum rules @xcite . in the limit",
    "@xmath88 , the sum rule ( 29 ) simplifies considerably .",
    "finally we obtain that @xmath89 where @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92",
    "in this section we present our results for the temperature dependence of the shifts in @xmath0 meson mass and leptonic decay constant . by derivativing with respect to @xmath93 from both sides of the sum rules ( 30 ) , and making some transformations",
    "we obtain @xmath94 @xmath95exp(m_{\\sigma}^2/m^2 ) } \\,\\ , , \\\\\\ ] ] where the bar on the operators means subtractions of their vacuum expectation values and @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98 for the numerical analysis , let us list thermal average of operators contributing to the qcd sum rules .",
    "the temperature dependence of quark condensate is known from chiral perturbation theory @xcite-@xcite @xmath99   , \\\\\\ ] ] where @xmath100 is number of quark flavors and @xmath101 .",
    "the low temperature expansion of the gluon condensate has been studied in article @xcite @xmath102 where the trace of the total energy momentum tensor @xmath103 is given by @xmath104 , and for two massless quarks in the low temperature chiral perturbation limit the trace has following form @xcite @xmath105 here @xmath106 is the total energy density and @xmath107 is the pressure , whose expressions are known in the low temperature region @xcite .",
    "the pion decay constant has the value of @xmath108 and the logarithmic scale factor is @xmath109 .",
    "we also use the fact that , the quark and gluon energy densities at finite temperature can be expressed as @xmath110 , which agrees both with the naive counting of the degrees of freedom and empirical studies of the pion structure functions @xcite , @xcite .",
    "for the numerical evolution of the above sum rule , we use the values @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "we study the dependence of @xmath0 meson mass and leptonic decay constant on @xmath114 , when @xmath114 changes between @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "this region of @xmath114 is obtained from the mass sum rule analysis of the @xmath0 meson @xcite .",
    "the shifts in @xmath0 meson mass and leptonic decay constant as a function of temperature for different values of @xmath114 is shown in fig.1 and fig.2 , respectively .",
    "as seen , the results for @xmath117 are stable for temperatures up to @xmath118 . at high temperatures",
    "the results for @xmath117 becomes unstable and the contributions of higher dimensional operators become important here , whose inclusions might restore the stability in @xmath114 to higher temperatures .",
    "the results for @xmath119 are stable and leptonic decay constant decreases with increasing temperature and vanishes approximately at temperature @xmath120 .",
    "this situation may be interpreted as a signal for deconfinement and agrees with heavy - light mesons investigations @xcite .",
    "numerical analysis shows that the temperature dependence of @xmath119 is the same , when @xmath114 changes between @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "obtained results can be used for interpretation heavy ion collision experiments .",
    "it is also essential to compare these results with other model calculations .",
