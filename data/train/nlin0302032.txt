    "the transport of scalar fields by turbulent flows is an important process in many physical situations ranging from the dynamics of the atmosphere and the ocean to chemical engineering .",

    "the problem is thus often addressed using lagrangian techniques @xcite .",
    "there is an established formal connection between the statistics of fluid particle motion and the concentration field of a diffusing scalar @xcite .",
    "hence the important modeling issue of predicting passive scalar transport in turbulence can be addressed by following the evolution of lagrangian particles @xcite .",
    "the dispersion problem of one or two particles in the flow has been studied in great detail . in particular",
    ", the seminal work of richardson @xcite leads to the prediction that the separation between two particles grows according to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the rate of energy dissipation in the flow .",
    "much less work has been devoted to the dispersion of @xmath4 or more particles .",
    "the remarkable organization of the flow , which leads to the formation of very sharp fronts of scalar concentration @xcite , has a non trivial signature on the @xmath4-point correlation function of the flow @xcite .",
    "this , together with the well - established relation between the properties of the @xmath5-point correlation function and the properties of the evolution of @xmath5 fluid particles advected by the flow , provides the motivation for studying the problem of dispersion of @xmath4 particles or more . despite recent progress",
    "both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite , little is known about the dispersion of @xmath4 particles or more .",
    "an extra motivation to study dispersion of more than two particles comes from recent theoretical attempts to model turbulent velocity fluctuations in terms of small sets of lagrangian particles @xcite    the evolution of three particles configuration in turbulent flows has been considered numerically in direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of @xmath4-dimensional flows , at moderate reynolds number @xcite . because of the limited range of inertial scales available in dns , the numerical studies are unable to answer questions about shape statistics in the inertial range . a phenomenological model , introduced to describe the shape deformation in the inertial range , in high reynolds number flows , lead to the prediction of a non trivial shape distribution @xcite .",
    "this model provided both the motivation and the theoretical background to analyze the experimental results of @xcite .",
    "this experiment provided important insight on the statistics of deformation , although the experimental setup also suffered from the limited inertial range .    in this paper , we consider the problem of lagrangian dispersion of @xmath4 particles with the help of the kinematic simulation ( ks ) method , introduced in @xcite .",

    "in this section , we briefly review the previous work on shape dynamics @xcite .      the evolution of a cluster of particles is described both by the overall scale , and by the shape of the object . in the case of a set of @xmath7 particles , located at @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , we define a set of reduced vectors involving relative separations only , defined by @xcite :    @xmath10    the radius of gyration is defined as @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the distances between the vertices of the triangle .",
    "the quantity @xmath13 measures the spatial extent of the swarm of particles . in order to characterize the shape , we introduce a moment of inertia like tensor @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the @xmath16-th spatial component of the vector @xmath17 . for a triangle in @xmath0-dimensions ,",
    "the tensor @xmath18 has two eigenvalues , @xmath19 ( note that @xmath20 ) .",
    "these eigenvalues characterize the spatial extent of the swarm in the two principal directions .",
    "the ratio @xmath21 between the smallest eigenvalue , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 : @xmath24 provides us with a quantitative measure of the shape of the object .",
    "an equilateral triangle corresponds to @xmath25 .",
    "the smaller @xmath21 , the more elongated the triangle is .",
    "the moment of inertia tensor can be used both in @xmath0 and @xmath4 dimensions to characterize a set consisting of an arbitrary number of particles .    in the case of a triangle ,",

    "in particular , the corresponding mean values are : @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .      in order to study theoretically the distortion of sets of @xmath4 or @xmath40 particles by a turbulent flow in the inertial range of scales , a stochastic model based on phenomenological considerations",
    "was proposed in @xcite . at the heart of the model",
    "is a simplified scale decomposition of the full turbulent velocity field , on the scale of the global size of the triangle measured by the radius of gyration @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "namely , the velocity field is written as : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the contribution due to the small wavenumbers or large scales in the usual fourier decomposition ( @xmath43 ) , @xmath44 comes from the large wavenumbers ( @xmath45 ) or small scales and @xmath46 originates from the scales of the flow comparable to the global scale @xmath13 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the large scale contribution is uniform over the triangular configuration of particles , and is therefore assumed in @xcite not to distort the set of particles . the @xmath46 part of the velocity field acts coherently over the scale of the triangles with correlation time of the order of the characteristic time of turbulence at scale @xmath13 , defined by : @xmath48 the small scale component @xmath44 is often assumed to be completely incoherent on the scale @xmath13 of the three points and its correlation time is short compared to the characteristic time of turbulence at scale @xmath49 .",

    "( [ reduced_vec2 ] ) , and @xmath55 labels the spatial components",

    "physically , the term @xmath65 in equation ( [ monte_mod ] ) stretches and aligns the set of points .",
    "this distorting action is opposed by the action of the @xmath66 term , which tends to make the shape distribution gaussian .",
    "the shape distribution resulting from these two effects is non trivial , and depends continuously on the ratio @xmath67 .",

    "the model turns out to reproduce qualitatively several important aspects of the experimental results .",
    "a detailed analysis of the experimental data however pointed out several shortcomings of the stochastic approach @xcite .",

    "in contrast to the stochastic model described above , ks defines explicitly the velocity field which advects the particles .",

    "note that no delta correlation in time is used in ks at any level and that the parameter @xmath93 controls the unsteadiness of the flow .    to investigate the geometry of clusters of @xmath7 lagrangian particles , we simply advect numerically lagrangian particles in the velocity field @xmath95 defined by eq .",
    "( [ vel_ks ] ) .",
    "this is done by solving a set of ordinary differential equations for the position vectors @xmath96 : @xmath97 with the initial condition @xmath98 .",

    "the quantities characterizing the deformation of the object , such as @xmath99 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 are monitored as a function of time .",
    "we then perform ensemble averages over many triangles in different realizations of the velocity field to obtain the relevant particle statistics .",
    "we firstly validate the predictions from ks with the experimental results @xcite . to this end , we choose the power of the spectrum @xmath100 , the ratio of inner to outer scales as suggested by the experiment , and we take @xmath101 .",
    "we then extrapolate our results to higher values of the ratio of inner to outer scales @xmath102 , to study dispersion in a high reynolds number flow .",

    "an experimental investigation of the problem of dispersion of triangles by a turbulent flow was carried out in @xmath0-dimensions , in the inverse cascade regime @xcite .",
    "the flow was confined in a small container , @xmath104 .",

    "a kolmogorov @xmath108 regime was observed , over the limited range of scales @xmath109 .",
    "the time resolution was also amply sufficient to follow numerically the evolution of particles .",
    "the evolution of a large number ( @xmath110 ) of triangles was then followed numerically . in this section",
    "we compare our results produced from ks with the experimental results of @xcite and validate our model in the process .",
    "it was observed ( see fig.3 - 5 of @xcite ) that the typical size measured by the radius of gyration @xmath13 of the triangles increased until it reached the largest scale @xmath111 of the experimental setup where it started to fluctuate around this value .",
    "the evolution in time of the mean values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( see figs.4,5 of @xcite ) showed a rapid decrease of these parameters corresponding to strong shape distortions of the triangles .",

    "the relaxation of the peak of probability for @xmath140 is faster in the ks than in the experiment .",
    "this small discrepancy is conceivably due to the large scale limitations of the flow .    at intermediate time scales , when @xmath141 is in the inertial range , the mean values and the distribution of @xmath26 are very close to the ones observed in @xcite .",
    "these results demonstrate that ks reproduces very well the main properties of the evolution of three lagrangian particles .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached in @xcite by comparing laboratory and ks results in two dimensions , and in @xcite by comparing dns and ks results in @xmath4-dimensions .",
    "ks is thus a potentially very useful tool both for fundamental studies , and for dispersion studies in a more applied context .",
    "the results of the previous subsection demonstrate that the ks model reproduces quite satisfactorily the laboratory results concerning the evolution of three particles in a turbulent @xmath0-dimensional flow .",
    "we now investigate the large reynolds number limit with the help of the ks .",
    "this is achieved by increasing the ratio of the largest to the smallest scale , @xmath102 irrespective of initial conditions .    a previous study @xcite has shown that the separation between two particles in the inertial regime shows sizable differences compared to the famous richardson s scaling , according to which the separation grows according to @xmath142 irrespective of initial conditions . specifically a strong dependence of two - particle dispersion statistics on the initial separation the particles was found @xcite . in the case of three particles studied here ,",
    "it is of obvious interest to investigate the statistics of the radius of gyration of the set of particles .",
    "also , the existence of a non trivial , time independent distribution of shapes , predicted by @xcite when the separation between particles is in the inertial range of scales , remains to be tested .",
    "we address these questions in turn , with the help of ks .    we stress that there is no guarantee that the evolution of @xmath4 particles is correctly predicted by the ks with @xmath100 when the ratio @xmath102 becomes large . in spite of this uncertainty ,",
    "the numerical results presented here are intrinsically interesting since the ks flow shares with real turbulence a number of important properties .",
    "the evolution of three particles has been followed numerically , using several ks flows , corresponding to different reynolds numbers , or equivalently , to different values of @xmath102 ( @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 ) .",

    "corresponding to @xmath147 ) show some resemblance with the small @xmath102 case , see section [ exp_ks_results ] ) . as the reynolds number",
    "is increased , the dependence of the variables describing geometry , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 becomes weaker , both as a function of the initial size of the triangle and as a function of time .",
    "the values of these variables is always significantly different from the gaussian values .",
    "the pdf of @xmath13 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 at the value @xmath151 also show trends which are similar to the ones observed at smaller values of @xmath102 ( fig .",
    "we have not followed particles long enough to see the gaussian distribution of shapes at very large values of @xmath102 ; the study has been restricted to the non trivial inertial range . in this range of scales ,",
    "the variation of the pdf as a function of time is considerably weaker than observed in section [ exp_ks_results ] , and in this sense , the results suggest that one may be getting close to the self similar shape distribution predicted in @xcite .",
    "a visible deformation of the pdf of @xmath13 can be observed as a function of time , reflecting the fact that at the later times , large excursions in the radius of gyration are getting close to the value of the largest available scale , @xmath82 .",
    "although still finite , the value of @xmath102 for run @xmath152 is significantly larger than it is in any engineering , industrial or laboratory flow .",
    "even so , our numerical results show persistent differences with the picture of a simple truly self similar regime .    in all the reported dns , in @xmath0 @xcite and in @xmath4 dimensions @xcite , a dependence of the behavior of @xmath153 on the initial separation",
    "@xmath112 has been reported .",

    "this behavior suggests that the set of three particles always remembers its initial condition , which represents a departure with respect to the richardson prediction .",
    "also , at a fixed value of the initial size of the triangle , a non trivial power seems to emerge as the reynolds number increases .",
    "a similar behavior was observed for the separation between two particles @xcite .    to investigate further this effect",
    ", we consider the pdfs of the radius of gyration , @xmath13 . fig .",
    "9 shows a superposition of the pdfs of @xmath156 for three different initial values of @xmath157 , and at different values of time .",
    "the distribution of the large values of @xmath156 are expected to be independent of time and fig .",
    "9 does not disprove this expectation .",
    "however , the distribution at small values of @xmath156 seems to vary throughout the entire evolution .    to compare different values of @xmath135",
    ", we have plotted the pdfs of @xmath156 corresponding to two different values of @xmath135 , but with similar values of @xmath158 ( fig .",
    "10 , 11 ) . for large enough times",
    "the pdf of @xmath159 seem to collapse at large values of @xmath156 within statistical errors .",
    "however , serious deviations are observed at small values of @xmath160 .",
    "in particular the peaks of the pdf at very small values of @xmath156 are much sharper at smaller values than at larger values of @xmath135 .",
    "these results suggest that the distributions of @xmath13 are influenced throughout the entire evolution by the initial value @xmath135 , insofar as a significant number of triplets do not really separate , and remain at a value @xmath161 . in the case of two particles this behavior",
    "has indeed been observed by jullien et al .",
    "@xcite in the laboratory for low reynolds number flows , by fung et al .",
    "@xcite and nicolleau et al .",
    "@xcite in high reynolds number ks simulations . in this way",
    ", the evolution depends in an essential way on the value of @xmath135 .",
    "the evolution of other geometric quantities , such as @xmath162 , @xmath127 reflects to some extent the behavior described above ( see fig . 5 , 6 ) .",
    "indeed , the lack of exact self similarity observed in the evolution of the radius of gyration , @xmath13 , shows that the prediction of a truly time independent shape distribution is at best valid at reynolds numbers impossible to attain .",
    "although this prediction might constitute a good first order approximation , which becomes better as the reynolds number increases , fig .",
    "6 shows that the mean values of @xmath26 , @xmath99 and @xmath27 _ do _ vary with time , even at @xmath163 .",
    "in addition , a systematic variation with @xmath135 is seen in fig . 5 , 6 .",
    "the distributions are observed to remain non gaussian as long as @xmath158 remains in the inertial range , and do correspond to a higher probability of observing elongated objects , as anticipated in the stochastic model proposed in @xcite . in the light of the ks results ,",
    "the stochastic model correctly predicts the main qualitative feature ( the increased probability of elongated objects ) , but it does nt incorporate the lack of self - similarity of multi - particle diffusion observed in ks . as we discuss in the next paragraph ,",
    "memory effects relating to this lack of self - similarity are observed in laboratory experiments @xcite .",
    "they are also observed in ks because , unlike stochastic models , ks incorporates the persistence of flow structures .",
    "whether this lack of self - similarity persists in the laboratory and in nature at extremely high reynolds numbers remains an open question .",
    "the results obtained so far suggest that the lack of self - similarity in the evolution of the radius of gyration , @xmath13 , is due to the fact that particles stay together , at a distance of order @xmath135 with a high probability .",
    "even if the radius of gyration grows to a value @xmath164 , it was observed in @xcite that two particles of the triplet can remain close to each other , with a large probability .",
    "we interpret the lack of a stationary distribution of shapes to reflect a similar cause : when one particle of the triplet separates from the two other ones , which remain at a mutual distance @xmath165 , a very elongated shape is created .",
    "the relaxation of the distribution of shapes towards a stationary distribution will depend on how the two particles that are close together eventually separate .",
    "our observations suggest that , the smaller @xmath135 , the longer particles will stay together , hence , the longer it will take the transient to relax .",
    "this lack of self - similarity is absent in stochastic models , such as the one proposed by @xcite , and is consistent with the view that coherent streamline structures are persistent enough to cause a dependence of turbulent diffusion on initial conditions .",
    "the ks model allows us to modify some of the characteristics of the advecting flow , both spatially and temporally .",
    "this is achieved by modifying the parameters @xmath166 and @xmath103 .",
    "the purpose of this section is to investigate the effect of changing the spatio - temporal structure of the flow , and in this way , to gain insight into the mechanisms involved in multi - particle dispersion .",
    "we firstly change the temporal structure of the flow by varying the persistence parameter @xmath93 ( see fig .",
    "this controls how fast the streamlines of the flow are jittered in comparison to the relevant eddy turn over time at the corresponding scale .",
    "this jittering makes the particles in the flow to be rapidly swept from one streamline to the other . since in ks",
    "there is no interaction among modes of the velocity field , this jittering mimics the sweeping effects that are present in a real flow field .",
    "the minima of @xmath167 and @xmath168 increase with increasing unsteadiness parameter @xmath93 within the inertial range of time scales which means triangles are less elongated for larger values of @xmath93 ( fig.12 ) .",
    "this happens because the paths of neighboring particles decorrelate faster for larger values of @xmath93 and triangles quickly forget their memory of the initial state .",
    "hence increased values of @xmath93 should cause the triangle shape parameters to relax faster to their corresponding gaussian values .",
    "secondly we change the spatial structure of the flow field by changing the energy spectrum i.e. changing the exponent @xmath103 in @xmath90 ( see fig .",
    "this has the effect of changing the density of straining regions in the flow field @xcite thereby modifying the separation mechanism of particle pairs and clusters .",
    "the minimum of @xmath167 and @xmath168 decreases with increasing @xmath103 ( @xmath90 ) within the inertial range of time and scales .",
    "this means that the clusters are more / less elongated during the inertial range of times when @xmath103 is made larger / smaller .",
    "an explanation of this effect can be given in terms of randomness : as @xmath103 increases there is less energy in the smaller scales of the turbulence which may mean less randomness leading to clusters remaining more elongated during the inertial range of times . in the context of ks as @xmath103 increases",
    "there is indeed less energy in the small scales leading to smaller unsteadiness frequency @xmath169 and therefore less randomness and more elongated clusters .",
    "however , a more searching explanation should invoke the spatio - temporal flow mechanism causing cluster elongation .",
    "one such mechanism already proposed in the literature @xcite is based on persistent effects of straining regions . the spatial density of straining regions decreases as @xmath103 is made larger @xcite .",
    "however , the simple calculation , presented in the appendix , indicates that the average straining rate per straining region increases faster than the number of such regions decreases when @xmath103 is made larger . provided that the effect of increased strain rate per strain region overwhelms that of the decreased number of such regions ,",
    "then the same conclusion is reached : clusters should remain more / less elongated during the inertial range of times when @xmath103 is made larger / smaller .",
    "we have investigated the lagrangian shape dynamics and the corresponding statistics of multiple particles namely of three particles advected by a two dimensional turbulent flow .",
    "we have used kinematic simulation ( ks ) to generate a turbulent velocity field and follow numerically sets of three particles in this flow field .",
    "the results of the simulation have been compared with the results of a two dimensional experiment @xcite .",
    "we have identified a mechanism for the shape evolution of three particles depending on the underlying flow structure and the effect of persistence of these structures on the statistics of these shapes .",
    "two regimes with well - characterized distributions have been identified in our simulation with ks .",
    "these regimes have also been observed in the two dimensional experiments of castiglione et al . @xcite .",
    "two different regimes can be identified , according to the fact that the mean separation is large compared to the largest scale ( diffusion regime ) or in the inertial regime .",
    "the diffusion regime is characterized by a gaussian shape distribution .    in the inertial regime",
    "the scale @xmath170 , we have observed what might be described as a trend , at best , towards a richardson s law @xmath171 .",
    "but the appearance of this regime was found to be dependent on the initial scale or size @xmath112 of the triangles .",
    "this has also been observed in the experiment @xcite .",
    "the temporal evolution of @xmath167 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 match with the experimental results of @xcite .",
    "ks predicts the correct temporal evolution and the distribution functions of the above quantities .",
    "monte carlo simulation can do as well except for the pdf of @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "it is found that the clusters are more / less elongated during the inertial range of times when @xmath93 is made smaller / larger ( fig .",
    "the reason for this result must be that the persistence of the straining action of the flow is diminished when the flow is made more unsteady by increasing @xmath93 .",
    "it is also found that the clusters are more / less elongated during the inertial range of times when @xmath103 is made larger / smaller .",
    "an explanation of this effect can be given in terms of randomness : as @xmath103 increases there is less energy in the smaller scales of the turbulence which may mean less randomness leading to clusters remaining more elongated during the inertial range of times .",
    "however , we also discuss a more searching explanation which invokes the straining mechanisms causing cluster elongation .",
    "the dependence of the shape of clusters on the initial separation between marked fluid elements is clearly demonstrated by the pdf of the radius of gyration of particle clusters with different initial separations not collapsing within the inertial range ( see figs.10,11 ) .",
    "our ks numerical experiments indicate that clusters tend to have memory of the initial state even when the turbulence has an extremely wide inertial range of more than four decades .",
    "this result is in agreement with the observed dependence @xcite on the initial pair separation of the apparent power law governing the growth of inter - particle distances .",
    "if these effects are transient and due to a finite range of inertial scales , then our results indicate that they might only disappear at extremely high reynolds numbers .",
    "however , the possibility should also be retained that these effects are not finite range transient effects , and are caused , instead , by the persistence of spatial flow structures at all scales , assuming this persistence remains at asymptotically high reynolds numbers .",

    "ap acknowledges support from idris , france .",
    "assume we are given the spectrum @xmath174 defined in the range @xmath175 of an isotropic turbulence .",
    "the mean square straining rate @xmath176 is proportional to @xmath177 . substituting the form of the spectrum and integrating we get for @xmath178 , @xmath179 in ks ,",
    "the number density of straining stagnation points decreases with increasing @xmath103 @xcite and @xcite calculated the following scaling relation : @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the number density of straining stagnation points and @xmath182 is the fractal dimension of the spatial distribution of these points in the flow . in 2-d ks , @xmath183 @xcite .",
    "hence the number of straining stagnation points per unit area decreases with increasing @xmath103 in our ks but the mean square strain rate per straining stagnation point , i.e. @xmath184 , scales like @xmath185 .",
    "this implies that , although the number density decreases with increasing @xmath103 , but the mean strain rate per straining stagnation point becomes stronger , which is the reason behind the decrease of the parameters @xmath148 and @xmath186 with increasing @xmath103 .",
