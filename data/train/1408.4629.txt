    "long flexible macromolecules in nature often appear in the form of closed loops ( rings ) .",
    "one can find such polymers inside the living cells of bacteria @xcite or sometimes higher eukaryotes @xcite , where dna occurs in a ring shape .",
    "loop formation is an important feature of chromatin organization @xcite , playing a vital role in transcriptional regularization of genes and dna compactification in the nucleus . on the other hand , many synthetic polymers form circular structures during polymerization and polycondensation @xcite .",
    "such a wide range of physical realizations , where the macromolecules of closed ring type can be found , make them a subject of intensive experimental and analytical studies @xcite .",
    "statistics of long flexible polymers in good solvents is known to be characterized by a set of universal properties , independent on details of microscopic chemical structure of macromolecules @xcite . in particular , the averaged radius of gyration @xmath8 and the end - to - end distance @xmath9 of linear polymer chains obey the scaling law : @xmath10 here @xmath11 means averaging over an ensemble of possible conformations of macromolecule , @xmath12 is the molecular weight ( number of repeating units  monomers ) and @xmath13 is the universal critical exponent , that only depend on the space dimension @xmath0 .",
    "e.g. , in @xmath14 the refined field - theory renormalization group studies give @xmath15 @xcite , whereas for the case of space dimension above the upper critical one @xmath16 one has an ideal gaussian polymer chain without excluded volume effect with @xmath17 ( note that corrections to scaling are logarithmic at critical dimension so that @xmath18 ) .",
    "the radius of gyration @xmath19 of closed polymer rings obeys the scaling law ( [ scalingr ] ) with exactly the same critical exponent @xmath13 @xcite . as the convenient parameter to compare the size measures of linear and ring polymers of the same molecular weight @xmath12",
    ", one can consider the ratio : @xmath20 which is universal @xmath12-independent quantity .",
    "it was found that in the idealized gaussian case @xmath21 @xcite , whereas presence of excluded volume effect leads to an increase of this value @xcite .",
    "note that for the closed circular polymers , the spanning radius @xmath22 is of interest instead of the usual end - to - end distance , and the ratio @xmath23 is another universal relation , which characterizes the spatial distribution of monomers within the macromolecule .",
    "as established by de gennes @xcite , the universal statistical properties of infinitely long flexible polymers are perfectly captured by the @xmath24-component spin vector model at its critical point in the formal limit @xmath25 . in particular , the polymer size exponent @xmath13 as given by ( [ scalr ] ) is related to the correlation length critical index of the @xmath26 model , whereas the universal size ratios ( [ ratior ] ) and ( [ ratiorpiv ] ) can be computed in terms of the critical amplitudes ratios of this model ( see e. g. @xcite ) .",
    "an important question in polymer physics is how the universal conformational properties of macromolecules are modified in presence of structural obstacles ( impurities ) in the system .",
    "one can encounter such situation when considering polymers in gels , colloidal solutions @xcite , intra- and extracellular environments @xcite .",
    "biological cells can be described as disordered ( crowded ) environment due to the presence of a large amount of various biochemical species @xcite .",
    "it is established , that presence of structural defects strongly effect the protein folding and aggregation @xcite .    the structural impurities in environment often can not be treated like point - like defects : they can be comparable in size with polymer chain or even penetrate throughout the system .",
    "the density fluctuations of disorder may lead a considerable spatial inhomogeneity and create pore spaces , which are often of fractal structure @xcite .",
    "these peculiarities are perfectly captured within the so - called percolation model @xcite , which already serves as a paradigm in studies of disordered systems . at critical concentration @xmath27 of structural obstacles ,",
    "an incipient percolation cluster of fractal structure can be found in the system .",
    "numerous analytical and numerical studies @xcite indicate the considerable extension of effective polymer size ( in particular an increase of scaling exponent @xmath28 in ( [ scalingr ] ) and increase of elongation and anisotropy of typical polymer conformations caused by complex structure of underlying percolation cluster .",
    "another special type of disorder which display correlations in mesoscopic scale can be described within the frames of a model with long - range correlated quenched defects , proposed in ref .",

    "such a correlation function describes defects extended in space , which form complex structures of ( fractal ) dimension @xmath31 , such that @xmath32 @xmath33 correspond respectively to the impurities in form of lines ( planes ) , randomly distributed in space , whereas non - integer values of @xmath34 refer to defects of fractal structure .",
    "the influence of long - range - correlated disorder on the critical properties of @xmath24-component spin model has been analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite within the refined field - theoretical approach . here",
    ", the variable @xmath34 was argued to be a global parameter along with the space dimension @xmath0 and the number of components @xmath24 of the order parameter , and thus the presence of long - range - correlated disorder leads to a new universality class for these magnetic systems . in particular ,",
    "the correlation length critical exponents in this case are larger than corresponding values in absence of disorder , and increase with decreasing the parameter @xmath34 .",
    "the effect of long - range - correlated disorder on the scaling properties of linear polymer chains was established by analyzing the critical properties of @xmath26 model in ref .",
    "presence of disorder in the form of extended structural defects causes the swelling of polymer coil ( [ scalingr ] ) with larger value of scaling exponent @xmath13 , and thus leads to an elongation of polymer conformation .",
    "further studies reveal an increase of the effective polymer size and shape anisotropy of polymers in long - range correlated disorder @xcite . moving from linear polymer chains to more complicated structures like star - branched polymers in environment with long - range correlated disorder ,",
    "one finds the whole spectrum of universal exponents in a new universality class @xcite . in this concern , it is worthwhile to study the influence of extended defects on the statistical properties of polymers of circular structure , which have not been considered so far .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the statistical properties of ring polymers in environment with long - range correlated disorder analytically , applying the direct polymer renormalization scheme .",
    "the special attention is paid to the universal size characteristics such as the size ratios ( [ ratior ] ) and ( [ ratiorpiv ] ) .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the continuous model of flexible circular polymer in disordered environment . in section",
    "iii the method of direct polymer renormalization is shortly described .",
    "the results for universal conformational properties such as the size ratios are evaluated in section iv .",
    "we end up by giving the conclusions in section v.",
    "we consider flexible ring polymers in solutions in presence of long - range correlated disorder . within the edwards continuous chain model @xcite , the linear polymer chain is considered as a path of length @xmath35 , parameterized by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is varying from @xmath38 to @xmath35 .",

    "let us denote by @xmath44 the average over different realizations of disorder and assume @xcite : @xmath45    studying the problems connected with randomness ( disorder ) in the system , one usually faces two types of ensemble averaging . in so - called annealed case",
    "@xcite , the impurity variables are a part of the disordered system phase space , which amounts averaging the partition sum of a system over the random variables . in the quenched case @xcite , the free energy ( the logarithm of the partition sum ) should be averaged over an ensemble of realizations of disorder , which usually implies the replica formalism .",
    "in general , the critical behavior of systems with quenched and annealed disorder is quite different .",
    "however , when studying the universal conformational properties of long flexible macromolecules , this distinction is negligible @xcite and one can use the annealed averaging , which is technically simpler . performing the averaging of the partition function ( [ model - con ] ) over different realizations of disorder , taking into account up to the second moment of cumulant expansion and recalling ( [ avv0 ] ) we obtain : @xmath46 with an effective hamiltonian : @xmath47 note that the last term in ( [ hdis ] ) describes an effective attractive interaction between monomers arising due to the presence of extended obstacles in environment , governed by coupling constant @xmath48 .    performing dimensional analysis for the terms in ( [ hdis ] )",

    "the  upper critical \" values of the space dimension ( @xmath53 ) and the correlation parameter ( @xmath54 ) , at which the couplings are dimensionless , play an important role in the renormalization scheme , as outlined below .",
    "to analyze the universal statistical properties of model ( [ hdis ] ) , we evaluate the direct renormalization method , as developed by des cloizeaux @xcite .    in the asymptotic limit of an infinite linear measure of the continuous polymer curve ,",
