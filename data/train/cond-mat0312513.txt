    "thanks to recent progresses in helium nano - droplet isolation ( hendi ) spectroscopy,@xcite the infrared and microwave spectra of small molecules solvated in he@xmath0 clusters are now becoming accessible in the small- and intermediate - size regimes.@xcite in the particular case of carbon monoxide , the roto - vibrational spectrum of the molecule solvated in small he clusters ( co@he@xmath0 ) has been recently studied in the size range @xmath3.@xcite the infrared spectrum in the 2145 @xmath4 region of the c  o stretch consists of two @xmath5 transitions which smoothly correlate with the @xmath6-type ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8-type ( @xmath9 ) @xmath5 lines of the binary complex , co@he@xmath10 .",
    "the series of @xmath8-type transitions  which starts off about 7 times stronger for @xmath11progressively looses intensity as @xmath2 increases , until it disappears around @xmath12 . around this size , just before it disappears , the @xmath8-type line seems to split in two .",
    "analogously , around @xmath13 the @xmath6-type line also seems to split , and the assignment of experimental lines becomes uncertain for larger clusters . elucidating",
    "the relation existing between the position , number , and intensity of the rotational lines and the size and structure of the cluster is the principal goal of the present paper .",
    "computer simulations of quantum many - body systems have also considerably progressed in recent years , allowing in some cases to determine the low - lying spectrum of excited states .",
    "the rotational dynamics of small molecules solvated in he clusters and nanodroplets is one of these favorable instances .",
    "the scarcity of low - lying excited states typical of superfluid systems makes it possible in this case to extract information on the location and intensity of the spectral lines from an analysis of the time series generated by quantum monte carlo random walks.@xcite the rotational spectrum of ocs@he@xmath0 has been studied along these lines in refs .

    "one contents oneself of this knowledge and the simulation simply aims at calculating the complicated multi - dimensional integrals which are needed to estimate ground - state _ approximate _ expectation values , @xmath15 ( here and in the following quantum - mechanical operators are indicated with a hat , @xmath16 ) . to this end , a random walk in configuration space is generated according to the langevin equation : @xmath17 where @xmath18 indicates the coordinates of the system , @xmath19 is the step of time discretization , @xmath20 and @xmath21 is a gaussian random variable of variance @xmath22 : @xmath23 .",

    "is the fact that sample averages of reptile time correlations , @xmath38 provide equally unbiased estimates of the corresponding quantum correlation functions in imaginary time : @xmath39 @xmath40 .",
    "the absorption spectrum of a molecule solvated in a non polar environment is given by the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function of its electric dipole , @xmath41 : @xmath42 where @xmath37 and @xmath43 are ground- and excited - state wavefunctions of the system respectively , and @xmath44 and @xmath45 the corresponding energies .",

    "information on excited states with different angular momenta , @xmath52 , can be easily obtained from the multipole correlation functions , @xmath53 , defined as the reptile time correlations of the legendre polynomials : @xmath54    both the he - he and the he - co interactions used here are derived from accurate quantum - chemical calculations.@xcite the co molecule is allowed to perform translational and rotational motions , but it is assumed to be rigid .",
    "the trial wavefunction is chosen to be of the jastrow form : @xmath55,\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the position of the i - th atom with respect to the center of mass of the molecule , @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the angle between the molecular axis and @xmath56 , and @xmath59 is the distance between the i - th and the j - th helium atoms .",
    "@xmath60 is expressed as a sum of five products of radial functions times legendre polynomials .",
    "all radial functions ( including @xmath61 ) are optimized independently for each cluster size with respect to a total of 27 variational parameters .",
    "the propagation time is set to @xmath62 , with a time step of @xmath63 .",
    "the effects of the length of the time step and of the projection time have been estimated by test simulations performed by halving the former or doubling the latter .",
    "these effects were barely detectable on the total energy , and very small on the excitation energies discussed below ( we estimate that more converged simulations would actually improve the already excellent agreement with experimentally observed spectra ) .    to    the estimate of excitation energies and spectral weights from imaginary - time correlations amounts to performing an inverse laplace transform , a notoriously ill - conditioned operation which is severely hindered by statistical noise.@xcite for each value of @xmath52 , we extract the value of the two lowest - lying excitation energies , @xmath64 _i.e . _ the two smallest decay constants in @xmath53as well as the corresponding spectral weights , @xmath65 , from a fit of @xmath53 to a linear combination of three decaying exponentials .",
    "this fitting procedure does not solve in general the problem of obtaining the spectrum from a noisy imaginary - time correlation function .",
    "however , if we know in advance that very few strong peaks , well separated in energy , nearly exhaust the entire spectral weight , their position and strength can be reliably estimated from this multi - exponential fit . in the present study these favorable conditions are usually met , although the limitations of the procedure will show in some cases , as discussed below .     for various sizes of the co@he@xmath0 cluster",

    "rqmc simulations have been performed for co@he@xmath0 clusters in the size range @xmath66 . in fig . [",
    "fig : deltae ] we report the values of the he atomic binding energy , @xmath67 , as a function of the cluster size .",
    "@xmath68 first increases up to @xmath69 , and it stays roughly constant in the range @xmath70 ; from this size on @xmath68 starts decreasing , first slowly , then , from @xmath71 , rapidly down to a minimum at @xmath72 . for @xmath73",
    "@xmath68 increases again and slowly tends to the nanodroplet regime ( where it coincides with the bulk chemical potential , @xmath74  @xcite ) which is however attained for much larger cluster sizes than explored here.@xcite this behavior can be understood by comparing the shape of the co  he potential energy function , @xmath75 , with the incremental atomic density distributions , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the expectation value of the he density operator : @xmath78 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : effetti - speciali ] ) .",
    "for very small @xmath2 the atomic binding energy is dominated by the he  co attraction which is strongest in a well located atop the oxygen atom .",
    "as he atoms fill this well , @xmath68 first slightly increases , as a consequence of the attractive he  he interaction , then , for larger @xmath2 , the increased he  he interaction is counter - balanced by the spill - out of he atoms off the main attractive well , until for @xmath79 the reduction of the he ",
    "co interaction overcomes the increased attraction and the binding energy starts decreasing steeply . for @xmath2 in the range 1014 he density",
    "accumulates towards the c pole , while , around @xmath13 , the first solvation shell is completed and the differential atomic density , @xmath80 , is considerably more diffuse starting from @xmath81 .",
    "@xmath68 reaches a minimum at @xmath72 . for larger sizes , the trend in the atomic binding energy",
    "is dominated by the increase of the he  he attraction related to the increase of the cluster size , until it will converge to the bulk chemical potential .    to    to    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ea_qmc ] we report the positions and spectral weights of the rotational lines , as functions of the cluster size , @xmath2 . in the size range @xmath82 , analysis of the dipole time correlations clearly reveals the presence of two peaks , with the weight of the higher  energy ( @xmath8-type ) rapidly decreasing by almost a factor 2 .",
    "note that the sum of the spectral weights of these two lines nicely sums to one , indicating that they exhaust all the oscillator strength available for optical transitions originating from the ground state .",
    "for @xmath2 between 10 and 12 ( shaded area in fig .",
    "[ fig : ea_qmc ] ) the situation is less clear .",
    "as the weight of the @xmath8-type line drops to zero , the statistical noise on its position grows enormously .",
    "furthermore the multi - exponential fit introduces some ambiguity , as the results are somewhat sensitive to the number of terms in the sum .",
    "however the important information that one line disappears between @xmath83 and 12 is clear . for larger",
    "@xmath2 only one relevant line remains , and the robustness of the fitting procedure is recovered , with the minor exception of the sizes around @xmath81 , where the minimum of the @xmath84 appears to be less sharp , possibly correlating with the splitting of the line observed in the infrared spectra for @xmath13 ( see below ) .    in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : e_expt ] we compare the rotational structure of the observed infrared ( vibrational ) spectrum@xcite with the rotational excitation energies calculated in this work .",
    "experimental data are referred to the center , @xmath85 , of the vibrational band for @xmath86 ( co monomer ) . in order to better compare our predictions with experiments ,",
    "we have corrected the former with an estimate of the _ vibrational shift _ , @xmath87 , i.e. the displacement of the vibrational band origin as a function of the number of he atoms . the vibrational shift can be calculated as the difference in the total energy of the cluster obtained with two slightly different potentials,@xcite @xmath88 and @xmath89 , representing the interaction of a he atom with the co molecule in its vibrational ground state and first excited states , respectively .",
    "our estimate of the vibrational shift as a function of the cluster size is reported in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : e_expt ] .",
    "since the evaluation of a small difference between two large energies is computationally demanding for large clusters , @xmath90 has been evaluated perturbatively with respect to the difference @xmath91@xcite we have used the vibrational shift calculated in ref .   after verifying on small clusters that the perturbative treatment is reliable",
    "the agreement between our results and experiments is remarkable .",
    "some of the features of the observed spectrum , however , call for a deeper understanding and theoretical investigation .",
    "two questions , in particular , naturally arise .",
    "why two peaks are observed in the small - size regime , and what determines the disappearance of one of them at @xmath92 ? what determines the split of the higher - frequency ( @xmath8-type ) line at @xmath93 and of the lower - frequency ( @xmath6-type ) one at @xmath13 ?    to    the existence of two lines for small @xmath2 is likely due to a larger asymmetry of the cluster in this regime .",
    "if the co@he@xmath0 complex is described as a rigid rotor , in fact , one would have one rotational line originating from a @xmath51 ground state if the complex has cylindrical symmetry , while this line would double if some of the atomic density accumulates in a longitudinal protrusion .",
    "the inertia of the complex would in this case be larger for a rotation about an axis perpendicular to a plane containing the protrusion ( _ end - over - end rotation _ ) than about an axis lying on such a plane . given that the he density in the ground state of co@he@xmath0 is cylindrically symmetric , any departure from this symmetry can only show up in higher correlation functions .",
    "the situation is conceptually similar to that of a fluid whose density is homogeneous and whose structure at the atomic scale is reflected in the pair correlation function .",
    "analogously , we define an atomic angular correlation function , @xmath94 , as the probability of finding two he atoms which form a dihedral angle @xmath95 with respect to the molecular axis : @xmath96 in the upper panel of fig . [",
    "fig : montarozzi ] we show @xmath94 , for different cluster sizes .",
    "the depletion of @xmath97 for @xmath95 larger than @xmath98 , clearly visible for @xmath99 ( green circles ) , indicates a tendency of the he atoms to cluster on a same side of the molecular axis . for larger clusters",
    ", however , this effect weakens to the extent that it becomes difficult to disentangle from the structural information related to the he  he interaction ( the dimple at small @xmath95 and the subsequent maximum around @xmath100 ) .",
    "a more sensitive measure of the propensity of he atoms to cluster on a side of the molecule is given by the integral of @xmath94 from 0 to @xmath101 , @xmath102 in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : montarozzi ] we display @xmath103 as a function of the cluster size , @xmath2 : one sees that @xmath103 decreases with @xmath2 and reaches a minimum at @xmath104 .",
    "this is the size at which the first solvation shell is completed , and the cluster asymmetry increases again when the second shell starts to build .",
    "the rotational spectrum of the solvated molecule , however , is insensitive to this asymmetry for clusters of this and larger sizes because the motion of he atoms in the second and outer solvation shells is decoupled from that in the first and from molecular rotation .",
    "the existence of a longitudinal asymmetry is a necessary condition for the doubling of the rotational line .",
    "whether or not this condition is also sufficient depends on the dynamics : if quantum fluctuations make the motion of the protrusion around the molecular axis fast with respect to the molecular rotation , then the asymmetry is effectively washed out .",
    "the existence of two lines in the rotational spectrum of the molecule implies therefore that an asymmetry in the _ classical _ distribution of he atoms around the molecular axis exists ; that the molecular inertia is sensitive to this asymmetry ( the protrusion can be ` dragged ' along the molecular rotation ) ; and that the motion of this protrusion around the molecular axis is not adiabatically decoupled from the molecular rotation .    to    in order to better characterize the motion of he atoms around the molecule and the coupling of this motion to molecular rotation , we examine the imaginary - time correlations of the versor , @xmath105 , of the he center of mass , @xmath106 , relative to the molecular center of mass : @xmath107 for the binary complex , he ",
    "co , @xmath106 coincides with the position of the helium atom , and we expect its angular dynamics to be strongly correlated to the molecular rotation , at least in the end - over - end mode . in fig .",
    "[ fig : adiab ] we report the frequency of the slowest mode appearing in the spectral analysis of @xmath108 , @xmath109 , as a function of @xmath2 , and compare it with the corresponding frequencies of the molecular rotation .",
    "we see that for cluster sizes up to @xmath110 , @xmath109 is degenerate with the @xmath6-type frequency in the molecular rotational spectrum , with a spectral weight which passes from @xmath111 for @xmath11 to @xmath112 for @xmath83 .",
    "these findings are a manifestation of the fact that he atoms are dragged along the slowest , end - over - end , rotation of the solvated molecule , and that the effect of this dragging decreases when more he states with @xmath50 become available and subtract spectral weight to the slowest mode . for @xmath113 , @xmath109 further increases and departs from @xmath114 , indicating an effective decoupling of the two kinds of motion . in this regime , the effective rotational constant @xmath115 of the solvated molecule is almost independent of the cluster size .",
    "free molecular rotation with an increased moment of inertia with respect to the gas phase is the typical signature of superfluid behavior in he nanodroplets .",
    "extrapolating the result obtained for @xmath2 up to 30 to the nanodroplet limit , we predict a renormalization factor of the @xmath115 value of 0.78 .",
    "the lowest atomic mode , @xmath109 , slows down again for @xmath13 .",
    "this is due , however to the slow he motion in the second solvation shell which hardly affects the rotation of the solvated molecule . although the resolution that can be achieved with our simulations is not sufficient to detect the doubling of the @xmath6 and @xmath8 lines which is experimentally observed for @xmath13 and @xmath93 respectively , it is interesting to notice that the former occurs in correspondence with the crossing between @xmath109 and @xmath114 , possibly due to the resonant interaction between the two modes .",
    "it is tempting to assume that a similar mechanism may be responsible for the doubling of the @xmath8 line at @xmath93 , involving however higher - energy he states .",
    "a deeper study of the he dynamics would clarify this point .",
    "computer simulations of quantum many - body systems have reached such a degree of sophistication and reliability that in some cases they can be used to provide information , complementary to that which can be obtained in the laboratory , on the dynamical processes probed spectroscopically .    in the case of small polar molecules solvated in",
    "he clusters , for instance , the calculation of the time autocorrelation of the molecular dipole ( which is the quantity directly coupled to the experimental probe ) allows to reproduce rather accurately the roto - vibrational excitation energies which are now becoming experimentally accessible for small clusters ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "even more importantly , computer simulations give direct access to quantitities and features ( such as , _",
    "e.g. _ , static and dynamic properties of the he matrix ) which are not accessible to the experiment , and whose knowledge provides the basis for understanding the relation between structure and dynamics in these confined boson systems .    in the specific case of co@he@xmath0 , which is the subject of the present study and of a recent infrared spectroscopy experiment,@xcite the presence of two spectral lines@xmath6-type and @xmath8-type , evolving respectively from the end - over - end and from the free - molecule rotations of the binary complex  is related to the propensity of the he atoms to cluster on a same side of the molecular axis , which we measure by an angular pair distribution function : as more he atoms progressively fill the first solvation shell , their clustering propensity weakens ; the co impurity gets more isotropically coated , looses a preferred axis for the free - molecule mode , and the @xmath8type line disappears .",
    "the time autocorrelation of the versor of the he center of mass provides dynamical information on the he atoms in excited states with @xmath50 .",
    "we find a substantial spectral weight on a he mode whose energy , @xmath109 , is degenerate with the @xmath6-type line for @xmath2 up to about ten .",
    "this indicates that some of the he density is dragged along by the molecular rotation  in other words , part of the angular momentum in the cluster mode involving molecular rotation is carried by the he atoms .",
    "we also find that for larger clusters the molecular rotation effectively decouples from this he mode , and its energy @xmath114 becomes essentially independent of the number of he atoms .",
    "based on the nearly constant value of @xmath114 in the range of @xmath2 between 15 and 30 , well beyond completion of the first solvation shell , we predict the effective rotational constant in the nanodroplet limit to be smaller by a factor 0.78 than its gas phase value .",
