    "in the last two decades , ultracold quantum gases have been the subject of many theoretical and experimental investigations @xcite . among the many systems that have been studied ,",
    "ultracold fermi gases have received wide attention @xcite . due to the experimental controllability achieved with ultracold gases ,",
    "quantum many - body phenomena such as fermionic superfluidity can be studied in great detail in these systems . by controlling and tuning the interaction strength between fermions in different states using feshbach resonances @xcite ,",
    "it has become possible to study the crossover from a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superfluid state of weakly interacting cooper pairs , to a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of strongly coupled molecules @xcite .    aside from the interaction strength , another important parameter that can be tuned",
    "is the population imbalance between fermions in different states .",
    "this parameter is of importance because spin - imbalance frustrates the bcs superfluid pairing mechanism . in the bcs state , pairing between fermions occurs at the fermi surface .",
    "however , a population imbalance will create a gap between the  fermi surfaces of the two spin states , making the bcs state energetically less favorable .",
    "theoretically it was predicted that at a certain critical spin - imbalance , known as the clogston - chandrasekhar limit @xcite , a first order phase transition from the bcs state to the normal state would occur . by preparing a fermi gas in one hyperfine state , and using a radio - frequency sweep to create a mixture of two hyperfine states ( labeled spin - up and spin - down ) , the transition from a superfluid to a normal gas , induced by spin - imbalance ,",
    "was demonstrated experimentally @xcite .    at this point , the question remains whether a non - uniform superfluid can exist in a spin - imbalanced 3d fermi gas .",
    "the most prominent example of non - uniform superfluidity is the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state , which was proposed independently by fulde and ferrell ( ff ) @xcite and by larkin and ovchinnikov ( lo ) @xcite in 1964 .",
    "the fflo state differs from the bcs state in that it has cooper pairs with non - zero momentum , which in position space results in an oscillating superfluid order parameter .",
    "it was suggested that this exotic superfluid state could exist at non - zero polarization . in part of the literature",
    ", a further distinction is made between the ff  state and the lo state : the former has one momentum component , whereas the latter is the superposition of two momentum components of equal magnitude but opposite sign . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the ff  state but we will henceforth call this the fflo state , bearing in mind that we mean the superfluid state with one momentum component .    following the success of creating a spin - imbalanced fermi gas , the theoretical investigation of the fflo superfluid state was intensified .",
    "the first studies focused on the three - dimensional ( 3d ) fermi gas , at the saddle - point ( mean - field ) level @xcite , and found that the fflo state is only present in a very small sliver of the ground - state phase diagram @xcite .",
    "the 1d case has also received wide theoretical attention , and has proven to be a promising setup for detecting the fflo state . in 1d ,",
    "the presence of the fflo state in the ground - state phase diagram is much larger compared to the 3d case @xcite . following these theoretical predictions ,",
    "the first indirect experimental evidence for the fflo state was found in a 1d fermi gas by the hulet group at rice university @xcite .",
    "inspired by this success , several new experimental detection techniques have been proposed @xcite , both for the 1d and for the 3d case . however , in the latter case , the fflo state still eludes experimental observation .    to acquire a better understanding of the fflo state in a 3d fermi gas",
    ", it is necessary to go beyond the mean - field level , which , while resulting in quantitatively correct results in the limit of weak interaction ( bcs limit ) at temperature zero , offers a qualitative description at best for temperatures above zero or for stronger interactions .",
    "up till now , little attention has been devoted to this subject and to the effect of fluctuations on the fflo state in general .",
    "one important exception is the work by radzihovsky , @xcite in which a low - energy model for the fulde - ferrell state and for the larkin - ovchinnikov state is developed , with an in - depth focus on the nature of the emerging goldstone modes for the latter state .    in this paper , we contribute to this subject by explicitly studying the effect of phase fluctuations on the presence of the fflo state in the phase diagram of a 3d fermi gas .",
    "our main motivation is the following : the fflo state is characterized by a momentum component @xmath0 , which means that the rotational symmetry of the system is spontaneously broken by this state . the momentum component @xmath0 results in an oscillating phase of the order parameter in position space .",
    "because of this , fluctuations of the phase of the order parameter are equivalent to fluctuations in the direction of the momentum @xmath0 .",
    "since a 3d fermi gas exhibits spherical symmetry , these fluctuations cost zero energy .",
    "hence , one would expect these fluctuations to proliferate and destabilize the fflo state .",
    "our main point of interest is to see whether the region of fflo in the phase diagram of a 3d fermi gas vanishes due to phase fluctuations , which would help to understand why this state has not been observed experimentally in 3d . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this specific problem has not yet been studied in literature .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ hydrodynamic effective action ] we derive a hydrodynamic effective action , starting from the partition function of a 3d  fermi gas with spin - imbalance , within the path - integral adiabatic approximation . in section [ fluctuation action ]",
    "we perform an expansion of the action up to second order in the fluctuation field , which leads to the fluctuation part of the action . from the fluctuation action",
    ", the fluctuation free energy is readily derived .",
    "subsequently , in section [ phase diagram ] , using this free energy , we calculate the phase diagram of the system and determine whether corrections emerge by taking into account phase fluctuations .",
    "finally in section [ conclusions ] we draw conclusions .",
    "in this section , the effective action describing the fflo state in a spin - imbalanced 3d fermi gas , with the inclusion of phase fluctuations around the saddle point , is calculated within a hydrodynamic approach .",
    "the starting point of this derivation is the partition function of the system , written as a path integral over fermionic grassmann fields @xmath1 and @xmath2 : @xmath3 where the action consists of a single - particle term and an interaction term:@xmath4 the action ( [ action ] ) is written in imaginary time @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 represent 3d position vectors , @xmath8 is the inverse temperature and @xmath9 is the chemical potential of the fermions in the spin state @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , we use @xmath11 as units . in the interaction term",
    ", @xmath12 represents a general interparticle potential . in this paper , only s - wave scattering will be considered at ultracold temperatures , therefore the interaction potential will be replaced by a pseudo - potential:@xmath13 where the interaction strength @xmath14 is related to the s - wave scattering length @xmath15 through @xcite:@xmath16 an alternative , elegant derivation of expression ( [ 1/g(as ) ( 2 ) ] ) can be found in @xcite .    using the standard hubbard - stratonovich transformation , the fourth - degree interaction term in ( [ action ] )",
    "is rewritten as a sum of two second - degree terms .",
    "the cost of this transformation is that an additional path integral , over auxiliary bosonic fields @xmath17 and @xmath18 , is introduced .",
    "these fields are physically relevant , as they are interpreted as the fields of the fermion pairs . following the hubbard - stratonovich transformation , the partition function becomes@xmath19   .",
    "\\label{partition function}\\ ] ] one way to introduce fluctuations into the partition function is to write the bosonic fields as the sum of a saddle - point contribution and a fluctuation contribution : @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in this way , amplitude- and phase fluctuations are fully intertwined , and both are automatically taken into account @xcite . an alternative way , which will be used in this paper since it allows ( at a later stage in this calculation ) to focus solely on phase fluctuations , is to write the bosonic fields in terms of an amplitude and a phase @xmath22{l}\\delta_{\\mathbf{x},\\tau}=\\left \\vert \\delta_{\\mathbf{x},\\tau}\\right \\vert e^{i\\theta_{\\mathbf{x},\\tau}}\\\\ \\bar{\\delta}_{\\mathbf{x},\\tau}=\\left \\vert \\delta_{\\mathbf{x},\\tau}\\right \\vert e^{-i\\theta_{\\mathbf{x},\\tau}}\\end{array } \\right .   , \\label{amplitude and phase}\\ ] ] where both @xmath23 and @xmath24 are real fields . upon substituting ( [ amplitude and phase ] ) into the partition function ( [ partition function ] ) , it is convenient to apply the following gauge transformation to the fermionic fields : @xmath25 . after working out the derivatives in ( [ partition function ] ) , the partition function becomes@xmath26 where the following nambu spinors were used:@xmath27{cc}\\bar{\\psi}_{\\mathbf{x},\\tau,\\uparrow } & \\psi_{\\mathbf{x},\\tau,\\downarrow}\\end{array } \\right )   \\text { and } \\eta_{\\mathbf{x},\\tau}=\\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{c}\\psi_{\\mathbf{x},\\tau,\\uparrow}\\\\ \\bar{\\psi}_{\\mathbf{x},\\tau,\\downarrow}\\end{array } \\right )   , \\label{nambu spinor}\\ ] ] in order to write the inverse green s function in block - diagonal form , where the diagonal elements are given by a set of @xmath28 matrices given by@xmath29",

    "the path integral over the bose field @xmath35 in ( [ partition function ( 1 ) ] ) can not be calculated exactly and hence an approximation has to be made .",
    "the most basic approximation is to replace the field @xmath23 by a constant @xmath36 : this is the saddle - point approximation . since in this article we want to describe phase fluctuations , we improve on this approximation by also considering fluctuations of the field @xmath37 around its saddle - point value .",
    "the specific choice of the saddle point is such that the fflo state is included in the current formalism .",
    "the fflo state is defined by fermionic pairs that have a non - zero momentum @xmath0 . in position space , this is equivalent with an oscillating phase of the order parameter @xmath38 .",

    "however , since the field @xmath42 is a general function of space and time , this will lead to an infinite number of non - diagonal terms in the action , making the calculation intractable . as a remedy",

    "this approximation assumes that the bosonic fluctuation field @xmath43varies slowly in time and space compared to the fermionic fields @xmath1 and @xmath44 . as a result ,",

    "in this subsection we briefly explain the method for constructing the phase diagram of the system , including phase fluctuations , starting from the fluctuation free energy ( [ free energy ] ) . in our previous work @xcite ,",
    "the saddle - point phase diagram for a 3d spin - imbalanced fermi gas at zero temperature was calculated , as a function of the chemical potentials @xmath91 and @xmath53 . for a given value of @xmath91 and @xmath53 ,",
    "the saddle - point free energy was minimized with respect to the variational parameters @xmath36 ( the superfluid band gap ) and @xmath92 ( the fflo momentum ) .",
    "the values of @xmath36 and @xmath92 at a given minimum then determined which state this minimum corresponds to : the bcs state ( @xmath93 ) , the fflo state ( @xmath94 ) or the normal state ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "now , phase fluctuations around the saddle point can be included by using the fluctuation free energy ( [ free energy ] ) .",
    "for each value of @xmath91 and @xmath53 , the contribution of the fluctuation free energy to the different minima of the saddle - point free energy can be calculated .",
    "this will result in a shift of these minima relative to each other , leading to corrections to the phase diagram .    however , an important caveat has to be kept in mind . in this paper , phase fluctuations",
    "are calculated by using an expansion of the action around the saddle point up to quadratic order in the fluctuation field .",
    "this expansion only makes sense when the saddle point is a local or a global minimum .",
    "if this is not the case , the quadratic terms will result in negative contributions to the action , which leads to an exponential divergence of the partition function because @xmath96 .",
    "because of this fact , only corrections to the bcs - fflo transition and to the bcs - normal transition can be calculated within the current formalism , whereas this is not possible for the fflo - normal transition .",
    "the reason for this is that the former two transitions are both of first order , which means there is a competition between two local minima . for given values of @xmath91 and @xmath53 , the fluctuation corrections to both these minima can be calculated and thus their relative shift can be determined .",
    "in contrast , the fflo - normal transition is of second order , so that there is a continuous transition between the fflo minimum and the normal minimum . from this",
    "it follows that for given values of @xmath91 and @xmath53 , either the fflo minimum or the normal minimum is present , but never both at the same time .",
    "hence , fluctuation corrections can only be calculated for one of the two states , for given values of @xmath91 and @xmath53 . as a result , it is not possible to calculate corrections to the fflo - normal transition .",
    "finally it should be mentioned that in order to calculate fluctuation corrections to the normal state , both amplitude- and phase fluctuations should be taken into account .",
    "this is because when @xmath36 goes to zero , both types of fluctuations become indistinguishable . because of this reason , we will focus solely on fluctuation corrections to the bcs - fflo transition in this paper .",
    "figure [ fdmuzeta_fl_3d_english.eps ] shows the saddle - point phase diagram of a 3d fermi gas with spin - imbalance , as a function of the chemical potentials @xmath91 and @xmath53 , at different temperatures .",

    ", the presence of the fflo state in the phase diagram of a spin - imbalanced 3d fermi gas is minimal . with increasing temperature , the area of the fflo state decreases in size , because the free energy of the normal state lowers relatively to the free energy of the fflo state ( as well as the bcs state ) when temperature increases .",
    "we find that at @xmath99 , the fflo state vanishes for all values of @xmath91 .    when adding fluctuation corrections to these phase diagrams , we find , surprisingly , that these corrections are very small so that their influence is not visible at the scale of fig .",
    "[ fdmuzeta_fl_3d_english.eps ] . to give an idea of the order of magnitude of the fluctuation corrections , we ` zoom in ' on the fflo area at @xmath100 by re - scaling the ordinate of the phase diagram in fig .",

    "[ fdmuzeta_fl_t003_details.eps ] .",
    "[ h ]    fdmuzeta_fl_t003_details.eps    we find that the fflo area is slightly enlarged when fluctuations are taken into account ( green + orange area ) compared to the saddle - point result ( green area ) , i.e. the bcs - fflo transition line lies at lower values of @xmath103 .",
    "the orange ( fluctuation ) area is relatively small , even compared to the fflo area , which in itself is only a small sliver on the phase diagram , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fdmuzeta_fl_3d_english.eps ] .",
    "thus we find that phase fluctuations , at least within a hydrodynamic approach , have only a relatively small quantitative effect on the fflo state , when considering the bcs - fflo transition . in fig .",
    "[ fdmuzeta_fl_t003_details.eps ] we have omitted the values of @xmath91 at which the fflo state is not present , since we only calculated corrections for the bcs - fflo transition and not for the bcs - normal transition .",
    "the somewhat irregular shape of the fluctuation area is due to the resolution of our numerical grid . at higher values than @xmath104 ,",
    "the contribution of fluctuations is negligible , even at the scale of this figure .",
    "this may seem counterintuitive , because the interaction strength increases when the density and hence the total chemical potential @xmath91 is increased , and fluctuations are expected to contribute more at higher values of the interaction strength .",
    "the reason , however , is that because we use the scattering length as a unit of length ( instead of the fermi vector @xmath105 ) the temperature relative to the fermi temperature @xmath106 is not a constant in figure [ fdmuzeta_fl_t003_details.eps ] : @xmath106 decreases with increasing @xmath91 , because the density and hence @xmath107 ( in units @xmath11 ) increases when @xmath91 is increased .",

    "[ fdmuzeta_fl_3d_english.eps ] to  units of the fermi temperature , we find that the tri - critical point ( indicated by a black dot in this figure ) lies at approximately @xmath108 .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the effect of phase fluctuations on the fflo state in a 3d fermi gas with spin - imbalance . starting from the partition function of the system ,",
    "the complex fields of the cooper pairs were written in terms of an amplitude field and a phase field . by choosing a suitable saddle point , in which cooper pairs were allowed to have a non - zero momentum @xmath0 ,",
    "the fflo state was included into the mathematical description .",
    "we then considered fluctuations of the phase field around the saddle point .",
    "because the resulting path integrals over the fermionic fields and the fluctuation field could not be calculated exactly , we used the path - integral adiabatic approximation .",
    "subsequently , the action was expanded up to second order in the fluctuation field , after which the path integral over this field could be calculated .",
    "this led to the fluctuation free energy .",

    "this method allows to calculate corrections to the bcs - fflo transition , but not to the fflo - normal transition .",
    "we have found that phase fluctuations only lead to relatively small quantitative corrections to the bcs - fflo transition .",
    "our results suggest that the fluctuation of the phase of the fflo order parameter , which can be interpreted as an oscillation of the fflo momentum vector around its saddle - point value , does not cause an instability of the fflo state with respect to the bcs state .",

    "<S> in ultracold fermi gases , the effect of spin - imbalance on superfluidity has been the subject of intense study . </S>",
    "<S> one of the reasons for this is that spin - imbalance frustrates the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superfluid pairing mechanism , in which fermions in different spin states combine into cooper pairs with zero momentum . in 1964 </S>",
    "<S> , it was proposed that an exotic superfluid state called the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state , in which the cooper pairs have nonzero momentum , could exist in a spin - imbalanced fermi gas . at the saddle - point ( mean field ) level </S>",
    "<S> , it has been shown that the fflo state only occupies a very small sliver in the ground state phase diagram of a 3d fermi gas . </S>",
    "<S> however , a question that remains to be investigated is : what is the influence of phase fluctuations around the saddle point on the fflo state ? in this work we show that phase fluctuations only lead to relatively small quantitative corrections to the presence of the fflo state in the saddle - point phase diagram of a 3d spin - imbalanced fermi gas . starting from the partition function of the system </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the effective action within the path - integral adiabatic approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the action is then expanded up to second order in the fluctuation field around the saddle point , leading to the fluctuation free energy . using this free energy </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate corrections due to phase fluctuations to the bcs - fflo transition in the saddle - point phase diagram . at temperatures </S>",
    "<S> at which the fflo state exists , we find only small corrections to the size of the fflo area . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that fluctuations of the phase of the fflo order parameter , which can be interpreted as an oscillation of its momentum vector , do not cause an instability of the fflo state with respect to the bcs state . </S>"
