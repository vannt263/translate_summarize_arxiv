    "object detection is one of the core areas of research in computer vision @xcite .",
    "it is extensively used for photo and video search across computing platforms and has been successfully deployed in many real - world world applications such as google image search @xcite , google now speech recognition @xcite , and apple siri voice recognition @xcite among others .",
    "machine - learning classifiers have proven to be very useful for implementing such detection tasks @xcite .",
    "a detection task is basically a classification problem of distinguishing an object of interest from a host of input data .",
    "traditionally , a single complex classifier model ( shown in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) ) is used to perform detection . here",
    ", all the inputs are processed through the single model to detect the object of interest . however , in order to scale to more challenging object detection problems , the classifier models must become larger , which implies an increase in computational resuorces . with computational efficiency becoming a primary concern across the computing spectrum ,",
    "energy - efficient object detection is of great importance .",
    "interestingly , we note that in a real world dataset , a major portion of input images have some characteristic broad semantic features like color , texture etc . that are common to the object of interest .",
    "consider the simple example of detecting a red ferrari from a sample set of vehicle images consisting of motorbikes and cars .",
    "the first intuitive step is to recognize all red vehicles in the sample and then look for a ferrari - shaped object from the sub - sample of red vehicles thus , we can reduce and simplify the original sample set by utilizing the semantic information as we progress towards the primary object detection task .",
    "this simplification can potentially reduce the compute effort . based on this idea",
    ", we introduce semantic decomposition of inputs into characteristic broad features , like color ( red ) or shape ( car ) in the above example , and using the representative semantics to build a hierarchical classification framework , with increasing levels of complexity , for faster and more energy - efficient object detection .",
    "1 illustrates our methodology . in the traditional approach shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , input training examples are used to train the classifier ( denoted as classifier x ) to separate data into two categories or classes : objects of interest that we are trying to detect ( class 2 ) and clutter or non - object of interest ( class 1 ) . at test time , data instances are assigned to one class or the other depending on their labels .",
    "the computational effort in terms of energy and time to process every test instance depends on the complexity of the network i.e. the total number of weights and the neurons composing the classifier . in the example of fig .",
    "1(a ) , a single classifier clearly needs to be highly complex ( more hidden neurons and hence , more synapses ) in order to separate the classes with high accuracy .",
    "however , this leads to high computational effort for not only the test instances that have common semantic between the two classes but also the ones that do not share common features across the class labels .",
    "in contrast , fig .",
    "1(b ) shows our approach where we create a semantically decomposed framework with multiple classifiers ( y and x ) with varying levels of complexity .",
    "certain images in the dataset have a common semantic information representative of the object of interest shown by the shaded region in fig .",
    "classifier y is trained to identify all those instances that share the particular semantic with our object of interest ( class 2 ) .",
    "it receives important yet simple semantically decomposed characteristics like color , edges , etc . from the input sensor data .",
    "the decomposed input features are simpler and easy to process than the original input image .",
    "thus , the classifier in the first stage ( y ) of the proposed framework are small scale ( or less complex with few neurons and weights).the complex classifier x is then enabled for all those instances that have the semantic information that model y is trained to detect .",
    "hence , a significant potion of clutter ( class 1 ) are filtered out or eliminated at the first stage in this process . the second stage x , same as the complex classifier in the traditional approach , tries to detect the object of interest from the original input image",
    "this approach can save time and energy , since all data instances need not be processed by the more complex traditional classifier .",
    "please note that since the proposed methodology adds an extra classifier ( first stage ) into the overall classification framework , the additional cost overhead for the instances that are processed by both stages has to be taken into account in the computational cost .    in order to observe maximum benefits and overcome the cost penalty ( that the addition of first stage imposes )",
    ", it is evident that the input dataset should have significantly larger clutter fraction than the objects of interest .",
    "fortunately , in many useful detection applications , only a small fraction of the input dataset has relevant objects of interest .",
    "for instance , security video based image detection aims at recognizing suspicious person movement from enormous amount of input data .",
    "however , only a marginal fraction of the sensor data has the relevant object of interest ( suspicious person in this example ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have quantitatively established that in a wide range of video - based object detection datasets , only 5% of the input data contains the relevant objects of interest .",
    "our approach exploits this disproportionate distribution of input data to obtain compute - efficiency .",
    "the amount of time and energy saved also depends on how appropriately we decompose the input data or extract the common features such that we can reject as much clutter as possible in the first stage at very low complexity .    in summary ,",
    "the key contributions of this paper are as follows :    * given an object detection task , we propose a systematic methodology to construct a semantically decomposed framework that exploits the common semantic information in the input images to perform faster and energy - efficient classification .",
    "the hierarchical framework has iso - accuracy as that of the baseline classifier . * the initial stages of the framework filter out clutter data based on semantic information . in this work",
    ", we use color and texture as the distinctive semantic traits to carry out object detection .",
    "we use hue - saturation - value ( hsv ) transformation @xcite and gabor filtering @xcite to extract color and texture components , respectively . *",
    "we propose an algorithm to select the optimal color / texture relevant to the object of interest .",
    "this enables us to construct the initial stage of the framework with lower computational complexity and reduce the additional cost penalty that the first stage imposes .",
    "the algorithm determines the best and/or configuration of classifiers in the initial stage to optimize the computational cost at iso - accuracy .",
    "* we also present a training methodology to construct the semantically decomposed framework .",
    "* we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach on two natural image datasets : caltech101/ cifar10 .",
    "we show that the semantic decomposed classification framework with anns provides 1.93x/1.46x reduction in average energy through hardware implementation on a 45 nm soi process .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss related work . in section iii , we present the basics on hsv and gabor filtering used for semantic decomposition on input data . in section iv , we describe our approach to construct the semantically decomposed framework discussing all efficiency and accuracy optimization criterion . in section",
    "v , we discuss the methodology to train and test the semantic framework . in section",
    "vi , we present the experimental methodology and benchmarks .",
    "we discuss the results in section vii and conclude in section viii .",
    "on the algorithmic front , using multiple classifiers for increasing learning accuracy is an active area of research @xcite . a class of work in ensemble based learning @xcite exploit the idea that different classifiers can offer complementary information about patterns to be classified which can be used to improve the effectiveness of the overall recognition process .",
    "ensemble learning techniques , for instance boosting @xcite and bagging @xcite , use multiple predictive models to produce an aggregate model whose prediction accuracy is better than individual models used alone .",
    "the viola - jones algorithm used for face detection is another classic example @xcite .",
    "it comprises a 21-stage cascade of simple detectors that operate on multiple patches of an image . at each stage , if an image patch matches a particular pattern , it is passed on to the next stage for classification ; if not , it is rejected early in the chain . the main motivation behind the above algorithmic techniques is to obtain an improvement in accuracy .",
    "however , using them to reduce energy and runtime has received attention only in the recent past @xcite .",
    "the use of multiple classifiers in our proposed methodology is entirely driven by energy - efficiency and reduced computational complexity .",
    "past research in building energy - efficient neuromorphic systems have considered application - specific solutions @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have proposed a scalable effort classification framework consisting of a cascaded chain of biased classifiers with increasing complexity that can dynamically adjust the compute effort depending on the input data .",
    "the concensus between the classifier s outputs is used to decide if classification can be terminated at an earlier stage .",
    "the methodology that we propose in this paper is complementary to the concept of cascading classifiers .",
    "however , the novelty of our work arises from the fact that we leverage the semantic information in the input data to obtain efficiency and reduced testing complexity .",
    "please note that though our training method draws inspiration from @xcite , our method has different focus , design and evalutaion strategies .",
    "other popular approaches that have been explored to lower the compute effort of the network is based on approximate computing @xcite . exploiting the inherent error resilience of a system ,",
    "a variety of approximate hardware @xcite and software @xcite techniques have been proposed to achieve reduced computational complexity .",
    "substantial improvements in classification tasks have also been obtained by combining or integrating the outputs of classification techniques @xcite . however , these techniques provide an explicit trade - off between efficiency and quality of results @xcite .",
    "our approach , on the other hand , provides energy savings , while maintaining classification accuracy .",
    "overall , the main focus of this work is to extract energy efficiency for object detection application while maintaining the output quality .",
    "our proposed systematic method extracts the appropriate semantic information characteristic of the objects of interest , thereby giving us less complex classifiers which is reflected in the low computational cost .",
    "in our proposed methodology , semantic decomposition is a very significant stage . in this stage",
    ", semantics such as texture or color components representative of the input image are extracted using appropriate image processing techniques . in this work ,",
    "we use color and texture information individually in a set of experiments described in section vi as the first step of eliminating objects that do not share common semantic information .",
    "we use hue - saturation - value ( hsv ) transformation @xcite and gabor filtering @xcite to extract color and texture components , respectively .",
    "the extracted components are then used as training instances to train the simpler ( or less complex ) classifiers in the first stage that filter out clutter from the objects of interest based on the absence of relevant semantic information . while we use color and texture as characteristic semantics",
    ", please note that other semantics can also be used with the proposed methodology .",
    "the hsv color space has good capability of representing the colors of human perception @xcite .",
    "the formula for conversion of rgb color space into hsv is shown below : @xmath0^\\frac{1}{2 } } ) , if ( b \\le g)\\ ] ] @xmath1 @xmath2 a regular colored image is represented by the rgb components .",
    "we use the above formula to extract different color components of an image based upon the h , s and v values .",
    "for example , the main colors in hsv component threshold range is shown in table i.    .hsv range for main color components [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we conducted a similar set of experiments on the caltech101 dataset by varying the fraction of clutter on the combined color / texture configuration .",
    "11 shows the normalized # ops for the images in table iv ( representations are same as table ii ) .",
    "we observe that the framework provides 1.35x-1.79x improvement ( with respect to the baseline ) in average ops per input as the clutter fraction is increased from 60% to 90% .",
    "note maximum benefits correspond to larger clutter fraction in the dataset .",
    "it is evident that the benefits observed are due to conditional activation of the final stage .",
    "now , in the combined configuration , the initial stage consists of and operation .",
    "hence , we can deduce that the final classifier in this case would get activated for lesser number of instances as compared to the configuration with only color as semantic .",
    "12 shows the average energy in both cases ( color , color and texture ) as the clutter fraction is varied .",
    "it is clearly seen that color and texture configuration gives more savings than the latter .",
    "this is due to the fact that the benefits of reduced final stage activation in the combined case overcomes the penalty due to the addition of texture configuration in the first stage .",
    "thus , our proposed design methodology ensures maximum cost savings by selecting the most optimum semantic configuration .",
    "we presented a systematic approach to optimize energy - efficiency of machine learning classifiers by exploiting the characteristic semantic information of inputs . we observe that certain semantic information is common across various objects in a dataset .",
    "we use the common semantic features to distinguish the objects of interest from the remaining inputs in object detection applications . based on the above insight , we proposed the concept of hiererchical classification based on semantic decomposition . we develop a systematic methodology to implement a 2-stage semantically decomposed classification framework using color / texture as semantic information .",
    "we achieve this by arranging the classifiers ( anns ) in increasing order of complexity as per the characteristic semantic features they are trained to recognise .",
    "the design methodology is equipped to implicitly gather the most appropriate semantic information for optimum efficiency . to quantify the potential of semantic decomposition , we used color and texture as a basis for segmentation and designed the hierarchical framework for object detection for various images of the caltech101/cifar10 dataset .",
    "color and texture information were obtained using hsv and gabor filtering operations , respectively .",
    "our experiments demonstrate significant improvement in energy over hardware implementation with respect to traditional approach .",
