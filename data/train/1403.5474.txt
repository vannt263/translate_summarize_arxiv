    "in the last two decades there has been huge advances in the generation of structured light beams with several spatial and dynamical features .",
    "probably the best known examples correspond to beams with orbital angular momentum ( oam ) , e. g. laguerre @xcite and bessel beams @xcite , though other possibilities with diverse transverse @xcite and longitudinal structure @xcite are not less interesting .",
    "the richness of structured beams is inherited to several optical phenomena . here",
    "we shall focus on spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) .",
    "spdc from structured beams can be useful for the implementation of quantum information protocols for which the encoding variables may be different from polarization , linear momentum or frequency of the photons . in quantum optics ,",
    "two - photon states entangled in polarization , usually generated via a spdc process , have become the most widely used entangled systems . in this case",
    ", the two photons in a pair usually have one of two orthogonal polarization directions @xcite . in most cases ,",
    "the description of the system is made in a hilbert space of just two - dimensions , though the role of the other degrees of freedom of the photon should not be ignored in general .",
    "quantum - enhanced technologies demand systems consisting of multiple entangled states , as well as quantum states entangled in multiple dimensions .",
    "the latter may , for instance , improve the communication channel efficiency in quantum cryptography @xcite .",
    "the generation of two - photon states with multi - dimensional entanglement has been shown to be feasible , and the challenge to control it is the main subject of many theoretical and experimental current studies .",
    "one way to produce entanglement in a hilbert space with dimension greater than two , is by taking advantage of the diversity of spatial modes of the electromagnetic ( em ) field .",
    "furthermore , from modes with well defined oam , it is possible to generate two - photon states entangled in this degree of freedom , which have a discrete dimensionality as a result of the quantization of angular momentum .",
    "the first experimental demonstration of oam entanglement in photon pairs generated by spdc was reported in 2001 @xcite and since then several similar sources have been implemented .",
    "the role of the linear and nonlinear electromagnetic response of the material used for spdc on the pump beam is essential for a precise description of the expected quantum correlations of the photon pairs .",
    "there is not a unique basis set to perform such a description .",
    "most studies of spdc rely on the use of the plane em wave expansion .",
    "accordingly , polarization , linear momentum and frequency become the natural degrees of freedom , and the effects of birefringence on these variables through the type i and type ii phase matching conditions restricts the possibility of spdc by conventional nonlinear crystals . for pump beams with oam",
    ", one may describe the system as a continuum superposition of plane em waves , or perform the description in terms of modes with oam .",
    "in the latter case it must be recognized that the birefringence of spdc crystals is able to modify both the polarization and the oam of the modes that propagate in them @xcite . as a consequence , oam conservation in spdc",
    "does not necessarily hold @xcite .",
    "most studies of this kind of effects take as starting point an effective scalar treatment of the em field and the paraxial description of the pump mode , though going beyond these approximations may lead to observable effects @xcite .    as already reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , for wide crystals , the plane - wave spectrum from the pump beam results in a multiplicative factor for the transition amplitude of the generated two - photon state .",
    "this opens the possibility of using spdc to generate photons with general properties inherited from the pump photons . in the case of a propagation",
    "invariant bessel pump beam , this could lead to the generation of propagation invariant photons with oam . in the present work",
    ", we theoretically study the circumstances under which this process is feasible and compare our analysis with available experimental results @xcite .",
    "notice that in the implementation of many quantum protocols , the photons with selected properties are generated in a given space region and are processed in a different location .",
    "propagation invariant photons have an angular spectra restricted to a cone in wave vector space .",
    "its perpendicular radius can be optimized for an efficient coupling to optical fibers @xcite .",
    "besides , they possess the self healing property @xcite , that is they tend to reform during propagation in spite of blocking part of them .",
    "this property makes them robust in scattering and turbulent environments .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe general features of type i spdc involving structured vectorial beams in a birefringent medium . in section iii , this formalism is applied to the case of a bessel - gauss pump beam .",
    "explicit analytical expressions and numerical results for the angular spectrum are given and compared with experimental results .",
    "the angular momentum properties of the photon pair are also analyzed , including a discussion on the pertinence of studying its conservation in the spdc process .",
    "finally , we outline conclusions derived from this study .",

    "this could be a consequence of the fact that in this orientation the as is more symmetric under the change @xmath228 , as illustrated in fig .  1 .    finally , in fig .",

    "the cas do not depend on the detailed phase structure of the pump beam in the wave vector domain , the results obtained in this work are expected to be valid for other structured pump beams such as mathieu and weber beams .    it was also shown that , as the magnitude of the transverse wave vector of a pump bessel - gauss beam increases , the emission cone is deformed into two non coaxial cones which touch each other along a line determined by the orientation of the optical axis of the nonlinear crystal . at this location ,",
    "the conditional spectrum becomes maximal for a pair of photons , one of which is best described in wave vector space by a gaussian like photon , with a very small transverse wave vector , and the other by a bessel - gauss photon with the same mean and width distribution of transverse wave vectors as the incident pump photon .",
    "both of them have their main propagation axis close to the cone expected for a gaussian pump beam .",
    "the results were successfully compared with reported experiments .",
    "the study on the oam distribution for the photon pairs showed the existence of clear correlations in the oam quantum number of the idler and signal photons .",
    "these correlations can be manipulated by varying the pump parameters @xmath123 and @xmath225 .",
    "they also depend on the orientation of the photon pair main propagation axes .",
    "the oam significant correlations involve a smaller number of @xmath210 and @xmath212 values for paraxial pump beams .",
    "this means that heralded values of @xmath210 , given a particular value of @xmath212 , could be easily obtained in that regime .",
    "however , even for relatively high values of @xmath123 , we observe some interesting oam correlation features . in particular , there is a trend to preserve parity ( the value of @xmath230 for the most probable photon pairs have the same parity that @xmath225 ) .",

    "there is also a trend to get the greatest transition rates along straight lines in the @xmath210 @xmath212 space .",
