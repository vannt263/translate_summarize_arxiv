    "cross sections of high - energy nuclear reactions are expressed in terms of nuclear parton distribution functions ( npdfs ) , so that precise npdfs are essential for finding any new phenomena in the high - energy reactions .",
    "recently , this topic is becoming important in heavy - ion collisions for investigating properties of quark - hadron matters @xcite and also in neutrino reactions for investigating neutrino - oscillation physics @xcite .",
    "determination of precise npdfs is valuable for studying various phenomena in heavy - ion reactions such as color glass condensate @xcite , @xmath8 suppression @xcite , and parton - energy loss @xcite .",
    "the npdf studies should be also important for heavy - ion collisions at lhc ( large hadron collider ) @xcite .    in neutrino oscillation experiments , most data are taken at small @xmath7 ( @xmath91 gev@xmath10 ) .",
    "we could approach such a kinematical region from the high - energy deep inelastic one by using quark - hadron duality @xcite .",
    "however , there are still unresolved issues in neutrino deep inelastic scattering . for example",
    ", an anomalous @xmath11 value was reported in the neutrino - iron scattering by the nutev collaboration @xcite .",
    "it could be related to a nuclear modification difference between the parton distributions @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite because the iron target is used in the nutev measurements .",
    "there is also an issue that nuclear corrections are different from the ones expected from electron and muon scattering experiments according to recent nutev data @xcite .    in these high - energy nuclear reactions ,",
    "nucleonic pdfs rather than the nuclear ones are often used in calculating cross sections by neglecting nuclear modifications although it is well known that nuclear corrections could be as large as 20% in medium - size nuclei @xcite .",
    "these nuclear modifications have been experimentally investigated mainly by the measurements of structure - function ratios @xmath0 and drell - yan cross - section ratios @xmath1 .",
    "physical mechanisms of the nuclear corrections are , for example , summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the small-@xmath6 region ,",
    "the npdfs become smaller than the corresponding nucleonic ones , which is called shadowing .",
    "there are depletions at medium @xmath6 , which is related to the nuclear binding mechanism and possibly to a nucleonic modification inside a nuclear medium @xcite . at large @xmath6 ,",
    "the nucleon s fermi motion gives rise to positive corrections .    because the pdfs are related to the nonperturbative aspect of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) ,",
    "theoretical calculations have been done by lattice qcd or phenomenological models .",
    "however , such calculations are not accurate enough at this stage .",
    "one would like to have accurate npdfs , which are obtained in a model - independent way , for calculating precise nuclear cross sections .",
    "we should inevitably rely on experimental data for determining them .",
    "studies of nucleonic pdfs have a long history with abundant experimental data in a wide kinematical region @xcite .",
    "however , determination of npdfs is still at a premature stage with the following reasons .",
    "first , available experimental data are limited .",
    "the experiments of the hadron - electron ring accelerator ( hera ) provided data for structure functions at small @xmath6 in a wide range of @xmath7 ; however , such data do not exist for nuclei .",
    "because of final - state interactions , hadron - production data may not be suitable for the npdf determination , whereas they are used in the nucleonic analysis .",
    "second , the analysis technique is not established .",
    "parametrization studies for the npdfs started only recently .",
    "the npdfs are expressed in terms of a number of parameters which are then determined by a @xmath14 analysis of the nuclear data . however , it is not straightforward to find functional forms of mass - number ( @xmath15 ) and bjorken-@xmath6 dependencies in the npdfs",
    ". furthermore , higher - twist effects could be important in the small-@xmath7 region .",
    "a useful parametrization was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite by analyzing @xmath16 structure functions and drell - yan data ; however , the distributions were obtained by simply assigning appropriate parameter values by hand in the versions of 1998 and 1999 .",
    "the first @xmath14 analysis was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , and then uncertainties of the npdfs were obtained @xcite .",
    "all of these analyses are done in the leading order ( lo ) of the running coupling constant @xmath2 .",
    "a next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) analysis was recently reported @xcite .",
    "the lo @xmath14 analysis with the uncertainties was also investigated in the 2007 version of ref .",
    "there are related studies on the nuclear shadowing @xcite and a global analysis of structure functions @xcite .    in this way",
    ", the parametrization studies have been developed recently for the npdfs , and they are not sufficient . here , we extend our studies in refs .",

    "@xcite , so that only the outline is explained in the following .",
    "the parton distribution functions are expressed by two variables @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the variable @xmath7 is defined @xmath18 with the virtual photon momentum @xmath19 in the lepton scattering , and the scaling variable @xmath6 is given by @xmath20 with the nucleon mass @xmath21 and the energy transfer @xmath22 .",
    "the variables for the drell - yan process are momentum fractions , @xmath23 and @xmath24 for partons in the projectile and target , respectively , and @xmath7 defined by the dimuon mass as @xmath25 . in our analysis , the npdfs are expressed in terms of corresponding nucleonic pdfs multiplied by weight functions : @xmath26 the functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 indicate type-@xmath29 npdf and nucleonic pdf , respectively , and @xmath30 is a weight function which indicates a nuclear modification for the type-@xmath29 parton distribution .",
    "the function @xmath30 generally depends on not only @xmath6 and @xmath15 but also the atomic number @xmath31 .",
    "it should be noted that this expression sacrifices the large-@xmath6 ( @xmath32 ) nuclear distributions .",
    "finite distributions exist even at @xmath33 in nuclei , whereas the distributions should vanish in the nucleon .",
    "flavor symmetric antiquark distributions are assumed for @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 in the previous analyses @xcite . from the violation of the gottfried sum rule and drell - yan measurements ,",
    "it is now well known that these antiquark distributions are different @xcite .",
    "it is more natural to investigate modifications from the flavor asymmetric antiquark distributions in the nucleon . in this work ,",
    "flavor asymmetric antiquark distributions are used in nuclei , and the distribution type @xmath29 indicates @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 : @xmath38 whereas the relation @xmath39 is assumed in refs .",
    "the number of flavor is three ( four ) at @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) @xcite .",
    "the bottom and top quark distributions are neglected .",
    "the strange - quark distributions are assumed to be symmetric ( @xmath42 ) although there are recent studies on possible asymmetry @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the charm - quark distributions are created by @xmath7 evolution effects @xcite . as for the nucleonic pdfs in the lo and nlo ,",
    "the mrst ( martin , roberts , stirling , and thorne ) parametrization of 1998 is used @xcite in this analysis , where the charm - quark mass is @xmath44=1.35 gev and scale parameters are @xmath45=0.174 and 0.300 gev for the lo and nlo , respectively . in our previous analysis @xcite ,",
    "the mrst-2001 version was employed . since the nlo gluon distribution is negative at @xmath46 and @xmath471 gev@xmath10 in the 2001 version , we use the 1998 parametrization in this work .",
    "negative gluon distributions in nuclei could affect our analysis inappropriately in the shadowing region .",
    "furthermore , other researchers may use our npdfs at small @xmath6 ( @xmath48 ) with @xmath491 gev@xmath10 for calculating cross sections , for example , in lhc experiments .",
    "we tested various pdfs of the nucleon , but overall results are not significantly changed .",
    "since we are interested in obtaining the distributions at @xmath501 gev@xmath10 in comparison with other distributions and also our previous distributions , we decided to use the mrst distributions . in the analyses of the cteq ( coordinated theoretical / experimental project on qcd phenomenology and tests of the standard model ) collaboration ,",
    "the initial scale @xmath7=(1.3)@xmath10 gev@xmath10 is used .",

    "the parameter @xmath53 controls the shadowing part , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 determine a minute functional form , and @xmath57 is related to the fermi - motion part at large @xmath6 .",
    "the parameter @xmath57 is fixed at @xmath57=0.1 because it can not be determined from a small number of data in the fermi - motion part . as it will be shown in the result section ,",
    "the antiquark and gluon modifications can not be determined from the present data at @xmath58 .",

    "following improvements are made from the previous analysis @xcite .",
    "first , the parametrization of @xmath6 dependence is modified .",
    "the meaning of the parameters @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is not obvious , so that it is difficult to limit the ranges of these parameters in the analysis . here",

    "they are related with each other by @xmath68 then , the values of @xmath65 and @xmath66 become transparent at least for the valence - quark distributions . from the measurements of the ratios @xmath69 , where @xmath70 indicates the deuteron , we have a rough idea that the extreme values should be @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the drell - yan measurements indicate @xmath73 for the antiquark distributions .",
    "the value @xmath74 and the extreme values for the gluon distribution are not obvious .",
    "second , the @xmath15 dependence @xmath75 is too simple . from gross nuclear properties ,",
    "the leading @xmath15 dependence could be described by @xmath76 . in order to describe more details ,",
    "the parameters @xmath13 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 are taken to be @xmath15 dependent : @xmath80 because the extreme values @xmath65 and @xmath66 are almost independent of @xmath15 according to the @xmath16 data and also from the previous analyses @xcite , they are assumed to be independent of @xmath15 . in addition , the parameters @xmath81 and @xmath82 are fixed in the antiquark and gluon distributions as follows . because the gluon distributions can not be well determined from the present data , the parameter @xmath83 is taken @xmath84 as assumed in the previous analysis @xcite .",
    "it means that @xmath82 and @xmath85 are related by @xmath86 from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : bici ] ) .",
    "there are still six parameters for the antiquark distributions and they should be too many in comparison with four parameters for the valence - quark distributions .",
    "we decided to fix the parameter @xmath81 , which is sensitive to the gluon shadowing ratio to the antiquark one because of the momentum conservation .",
    "we found that the gluon shadowing can not be well determined even in the nlo analysis ; therefore , the value of @xmath81 is taken so that the gluon shadowing is similar to the antiquark shadowing .",
    "after all , the following twelve parameters are used for expressing the nuclear modifications : @xmath87 these parameters are determined by the following global analysis .      most of used experimental data are explained in ref .",

    ".    additional data to the hkn04 ( hirai , kumano , nagai in 2004 ) analysis are the ones for the deuteron - proton ratio @xmath5 . these deuteron data are added because precise nuclear modifications are needed for the deuteron which is , for example , used in heavy - ion experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 data are taken from the measurements by the emc @xcite , the bcdms @xcite , the fermilab - e665 @xcite , and the nmc @xcite .",
