    "spintronic devices require in addition to efficient spin injection and detection components also a good spin transmitting material , with minimal loss of spin information @xcite . the proper extraction of spin properties in a particular material : spin relaxation time @xmath3 , spin diffusion coefficient @xmath4 and spin relaxation length @xmath5 , is essential for understanding of spin dephasing mechanisms and for improving the spin performance of materials .",
    "so far the most promising materials for electronic spin guide are : silicon@xcite with @xmath6  @xmath7 m and graphene with @xmath8 m at room temperature@xcite .",
    "spin properties are mostly characterized by the electronic transport in a lateral spin valve structure , which is a device with ferromagnetic injector and detector separated by the nonmagnetic material of interest @xcite .",
    "hanle effect , especially in four - terminal nonlocal geometry is considered the most reliable way for determining spin coefficients @xcite .",
    "firstly , it enables the spin signal to be separated from a spurious background and , secondly , it allows @xmath3 and @xmath4 to be independently extracted .",
    "although very powerful , the fitting of the hanle measurements requires much care .",
    "effects of invasive contacts on hanle signal are discussed in ref .  .",
    "an influence of the finite device geometry has so far been discussed only in its relation to the amplitude of the spin accumulation @xcite ignoring the effects on the hanle signal .",
    "however the geometrical confinement leads to interference effects due to reflection of spins from the channel ends , which modifies the lineshape of the hanle signal critical for extracting @xmath3 and @xmath4 .    here",
    "we address the spin confinement effects , in particular the compatibility of the standard analytic hanle formula , derived for infinite channel length , with the signal obtained in devices of finite length @xmath0 .",
    "this situation is common when dealing with micromechanically cleaved graphene @xcite .",
    "we determine how the finite length of the spin channel alters the hanle precession lineshape and the spin coefficients extracted when fitting with a standard analytic solution .",
    "we establish the length scale at which the device size is important and propose an analytic extension of the hanle formula to include the multiple reflections of spins from the channel ends .",
    "we verify our analytic model with a finite - element numerical model of spin precession , where the device geometry is explicitly defined .",
    "our analytic model can be easily adapted to any lateral device geometry .",
    "we also indicate when the confinement of the spins results in a transition from 1d to 0d spin transport description with a simple lorentzian - type of hanle .",
    "our work concludes with instructions on how to account for the finite geometry effects in the hanle fitting procedure .",
    "we show that the role of geometry scales universally with @xmath1 .",
    "the presented description can be applied to any channel material like non - magnetic metals or semiconductors , including graphene .",
    "spin transport through a non - magnetic material can be successfully modeled by distinguishing two spin channels @xcite - one for majority and one for minority spins - and by introducing the spin accumulation @xmath9 , which is the difference between the electrochemical potential for each spin channel .",
    "we focus the analysis on non - local spin transport , where the current flows through the part of the device that is outside of the detection circuit .",
    "we base our analysis on graphene as a channel material to reduce the spin transport description to a 2d case .",
    "moreover , in strips , where contacts cover the whole width of the channel , the spin profile is uniform along the contact and the description can be further reduced to 1d .",
    "we also exclude conductivity mismatch effects and contact induced dephasing @xcite , as they can be circumvented by setting a highly resistive tunnel barrier .",
