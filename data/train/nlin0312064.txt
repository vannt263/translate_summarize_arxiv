    "spiral waves are characteristic structures of excitable media that have been observed in many extended systems such as reaction - diffusion media @xcite , aggregating colonies of slime mold @xcite , and heart tissues @xcite , where they are suspected to play an essential role in cardiac arrhythmia and fibrillation .",
    "sudden cardiac death resulting from ventricular fibrillation is generated from the fragmenting or breakup of spiral waves @xcite .",
    "spiral waves are prone to a variety of instabilities @xcite , one of which is meander instability @xcite , where spiral tips follow a hypocycloid trajectory instead of moving around a small circle . due to doppler effect , this spiral may undergo a transition from ordered spiral patterns to a state of defect - mediated turbulence @xcite . in the meandering regime",
    ", the spiral tips can be made to drift and controlled by external influences @xcite or localized inhomogeneities of defects @xcite .",
    "after the concept of small - world connections was proposed by watts and strogatz @xcite , it has quickly attracted much attention because this kind of connections exists commonly in real world , such as in social systems @xcite , neural networks @xcite and epidemic problems @xcite .",
    "different studies show that a little change of the network connections can essentially change the features of a given medium , and plays a very important role in determining the dynamic behavior of a system .    in numerical simulations ,",
    "a spatially extended system can be approximately regarded as a network consisting of a number of sites connected with certain topology . in this way",
    "localized inhomogeneities can be achieved by changing the topology of the network . in heart tissues ,",
    "pacemakers dominate the dynamics of the travelling wave behavior and control the heart rhythm .",
    "we hypothesize that this happens because the characters and the structures of the local cells are different from other cardiac muscle cells .",
    "could a small - world network describe one of the characters of the pacemaker ? to answer this question , we changed the widely used regular network in spiral wave study to a small - world network in part of the system to investigate its effects .    in the next section , we study the effect of a local small - world network on the behavior of spiral waves .",
    "we show that this special region is a dynamic attractor for spiral tips . in section iii",
    ", we compare the effect of the small - world network with that of changing diffusion coefficient in the local region , and show that they are equivalent .",
    "we give a discussion and conclude our study in the last section .",
    "the model we used is the two - variable fitzhugh - nagumo model @xcite with local nearest - neighbor couplings in a region of @xmath0 : @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 ; @xmath4 and @xmath5 is dimensionless excitable variable and recovery variable respectively ; @xmath6 and @xmath7 are diffusion coefficients of the two variables .",
    "the laplacien in the last term can be approximated as : @xmath8 when @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , the equation describes an excitable medium , which can be regarded as a simplified model for cardiac tissues . in the following discussion , we set the control parameters as follows : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18",
    ". no - flux boundary condition is applied in the simulation .    using vertical gradient distribution initial condition",
    ", we first create spiral waves in regular lattices ( fig .",
    "1(a ) ) . in this case",
    ", the spiral tip follows a hypocycloid trajectory , showing a typical sign of meandering state @xcite , see fig .",
    "we then create a small - world network in a small local region @xmath19 of a size @xmath20 , where the tip of spiral waves locates .",
    "the small - world network is created in the following way : with the probability @xmath21 , we reconnect every edge in the region @xmath19 from one of its original vertex to another vertex chosen randomly in the region @xcite(see fig .",
    "the change of connections leads to the change of `` diffusion '' mode .",
    "supposing node[i][j ] is connected with node[@xmath22[@xmath23 , node[@xmath24[@xmath25 ,  node [ @xmath26[@xmath27 , then the `` diffusion '' term in the eqs ( 1 ) ( 2 ) becomes : @xmath28    ; ( b ) a small - world network , @xmath29 ; ( c ) spiral wave and its tip s motion in the regular network .",
    "the white curve is the trajectory of the spiral tip ; ( d ) spiral wave and its tip s motion in the small - world network .",
    "@xmath30.,width=302 ]    introducing the small - world network region in the reaction medium greatly influences the motion of the spiral tip .",
    "we find that the small - world network region can attract the spiral tip as it passes through the region .",
    "after that , the spiral tip rotates around its boundary , as shown in fig .",
    "because the topological structure of the local small - world network is generated randomly under the above mentioned rule , the attraction only occurs under a certain parameter range with certain probability . to characterize the attraction property of the small - world network",
    ", we use the attraction probability @xmath31 as an order parameter , which can be obtained by repeating ( 50 times in our work ) the simulation using the same control parameters but with different small - world network connections .",
    "our simulation results show that the most influential factor to @xmath31 is the small - world creation probability @xmath32 .",
    "as show in fig .",
    "2(a ) , @xmath31 increases with the increase of the small - world @xmath32 . when @xmath33 ( corresponding to a regular network ) , the spiral tip can not be attracted ; when @xmath34 ( corresponding to a random network ) , the tip can be attracted with probability 1 . between @xmath35 ,",
    "there is a transition where the attraction probability @xmath31 increases rapidly .",
    "the transition point @xmath36 can be defined as the value of @xmath37 when @xmath38 .     as a function of @xmath32 with different @xmath39 .",

    "@xmath41 will decrease from @xmath49 to @xmath50 when @xmath32 changes from 0 to 1 . from numerical simulations",
    ", we find the same type of transition curve of @xmath51 as a function of @xmath41 , as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , indicating that the major effect of the small - world topology to the behavior of spiral waves is the decrease of average path length .",
    "in addition , defining the critical length @xmath52 as the value of @xmath41 when @xmath38 , we find that the critical length decreases linearly as the increase of the size of @xmath19 , see fig .",
    "our simulation results suggest that the major effect of the small - world network on spiral tip movement comes from the long distance connections , which lead to shortening the average path length ( @xmath41 ) and increasing the diffusion speed .",
    "if the above suggestion is correct , the phenomenon of spiral tip attraction should also occur when we locally increase the diffusion constant in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "in this part of work , we increase the diffusion coefficient in a small circular region @xmath19 by @xmath53 times and keep the system with regular connections . in the following discussion",
    ", we will use @xmath54 to denote the diffusion coefficient in region @xmath55 , and use @xmath56 for the region outside of @xmath55 , so that @xmath57 .",
    "we find that the spiral tip can be attracted and travel around the boundary of region @xmath55 when @xmath58 is large enough and @xmath59.(@xmath60 is the radius of @xmath19 , @xmath61 is the core radius of spiral when @xmath62 ) . at a given @xmath60",
    ", we can define two values @xmath63 and @xmath64 : a temporal attraction occurs when @xmath65 . in that case , the tip can be trapped for a short period and then escapes ; the `` trapped '' time increases with @xmath58 . when @xmath66 , the tip can be trapped for a long enough period .",
    "define @xmath67 as the mean value of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , the plot of @xmath67 with different @xmath60 is shown in the fig .",
    "the above simulation results suggest that the increase of diffusion speed in the small region is responsible for the attraction of the spiral tip .",
    "to quantitatively compare the two systems , we analyze the diffusion terms of the two systems . in the small - world network , because of the long distance connections , the average distance between nodes declines as @xmath32 increases from @xmath68 to @xmath49 . in a network model of a reaction - diffusion system",
    ", this effect can be in a sense translated from the decrease of the average path length between nodes while keeping the distance of two neighboring nodes @xmath69 constant , to the decrease of the step length @xmath69 while keeping the network regular .",
    "the normalized average path length @xmath41 can also describe the relative change of @xmath69 . from this argument",
    ", the diffusion items of the small - world network can be expressed as : @xmath70    at the critical point , for a fixed @xmath60 , the diffusion terms in two systems should be the same .",
    "so that @xmath71 , which gives @xmath72 . as presented in fig .",
    "3(b ) , our simulation fits this analysis within the range of error .",
    "this result indicates that our proposition is reasonable .",
    "the attracting effect of the small - world network comes from the decline of @xmath41 inside the inhomogeneous area @xmath19 .     as a function of the region s radius @xmath60 , @xmath73",
    ", the error bar is @xmath45,(see the caption of fig .",
    "2(b ) about the fitting ) ; ( b ) @xmath74 as a function of @xmath60.,width=226 ]",
    "a question should be answered before fully understanding the effect of the small - world network in the dynamics of spiral tips : what is the mechanism for the spiral tip attraction ? in the following discussion , we give an explanation with the eikonal equation , luther equation @xcite , and the relation between diffusion coefficient and of spiral core radius . according to the analysis of the spiral tip dynamics given by hakim and karma @xcite , for the steady rotational movement of a spiral tip in an excitable medium ,",
    "the core radius @xmath60 as a function of diffusion coefficient can be written as : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the diffusion coefficient of activator ( @xmath77 ) ; @xmath78 is the speed of plane wave ; @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are all constants .",
    "@xmath82 is the constant width of the excited region . in the simulation",
    ", we assume that at the boundary of @xmath55 exists a `` virtual '' gradient region of @xmath6 which links the outside and inside regions . for a given @xmath60 of the region @xmath83 ,",
    "the `` trapped '' motion of the spiral tip requires a specific value of @xmath76 , satisfying equation ( [ eq : g1 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath84 , the spiral tip will enter the gradient region where the system can find the required @xmath76 , so that the spiral tip will rotate around the gradient area at the boundary of @xmath19 ; on the other hand , when @xmath85 , the `` trapped '' motion can not be sustained by the central region . from this argument , at critical point , we will have @xmath86 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "4 , our simulation results are consistent with this analysis with the range of error .",
    "to prove the `` trapped '' state of tip motion is a stable state , we apply the eikonal equation , which determines the relation between the curvature of a travelling wave front and its speed in an excitable medium , and the luther relation , which describes the relation between the speed of chemical waves and the diffusion coefficient of activator @xcite .",
    "the eikonal equation is : @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the normal wave speed , @xmath89 is the local curvature of the wave front ; the luther equation is : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a constant .",
    "insert the luther equation into eikonal relation we have : @xmath92 taking partial derivative of r in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h1 ] ) , we get : @xmath93\\cdot \\frac{\\partial d_{u}}{\\partial r } \\label{eq : h2}\\ ] ] at the spiral tip we have @xmath94 , so that : @xmath95    in our system , assuming there exists a continuous change of @xmath76 at the boundary of region @xmath96 , we have @xmath97 .",
    "thus the equation ( [ eq : h3 ] ) indicates that @xmath98 .",
    "that means , if we introduce a small deviation from the `` trapped '' motion of the spiral tip , the system will return to the `` trapped '' state spontaneously , because we have @xmath99 inside the region @xmath55 , and @xmath100 outside the region @xmath55.(@xmath101 points to the center of @xmath96 region ) .    in conclusion",
    ", we find that in an excitable system local change of topological structure can trap the spiral tip .",
    "this ability comes from the increase of diffusion speed .",
    "we prove this by increasing the diffusion coefficient .",
    "we also give a theoretical explanation using the eikonal equation , luther equation , and the relation between core radius and diffusion coefficient , which fits well with the results of simulation .",
    "we should note that there are other situations where the tip of spiral waves can be trapped in a given area .",
    "for example , lzr _ et al .",
    "_ reported that self - sustained chemical waves can rotate around a central obstacle in an annular 2-d excitable system , and the wave fronts in the case of an annular excitable region are purely involutes of the central obstacle in the asymptotic state @xcite .",
    "obviously this phenomenon is beyond our analysis . so that more work should be done to fully understand the attract effect of local inhomogeneities in an excitable reaction - diffusion system ."
