    "static and spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions have always been a rich source of investigation in classical general relativity ever since the pioneering work of schwarzschild in 1916 .",
    "he solved the field equations for the interior region by assuming a perfect fluid of constant energy density , and also for the outside vacuum region , the famous schwarzschild solutions .",
    "the interior solution has the geometry of a three - sphere , which was noticed as early as 1919 by weyl  @xcite .",
    "the pressure of the schwarzschild interior solution always vanishes before the equator of the three - sphere , therefore , this geometrical picture is not of great importance .",
    "this situation chances significantly in the presence of the cosmological constant  @xcite . in some special cases the interior metric with cosmological constant",
    "was studied earlier , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "however , the complete analysis was only completed  @xcite 85 years after weyl noted the interesting geometrical structure of these solutions : with @xmath0 the pressure can vanish exactly at the equator of the three - sphere in which case one has to join on the nariai metric  @xcite as the exterior vacuum metric .",
    "we note that although the spatial geometry of the interior schwarzschild is a three sphere , the four - metric is not homogeneous .",
    "there is a center of symmetry in the fluid region , surrounded with concentric spheres defined by the orbits of the group generating spherical symmetry .",
    "the spacetime metric associate an induced metric and thereby an area to each group orbit . going outwards from the center this area is increasing until one reaches the equator , the sphere with the maximal area .",
    "it is furthermore possible that the pressure vanishes in a region where the area of the group orbits is decreasing .",
    "lastly , the matter can occupy the whole three - sphere having two regular centers .",
    "this generalizes the einstein static universe  @xcite , see  @xcite for early results in that direction .",
    "the einstein universe also emerges as a special case ( vanishing expansion rate and vanishing vorticity ) when considering homogeneous shear - free perfect fluids  @xcite . in recent years",
    "it has been generalized in various different theories , like brane world models  @xcite , einstein - cartan theory  @xcite , in modified gravity theories  @xcite or loop quantum gravity  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are analyzing systematically the effects of a positive cosmological constant on perfect fluid spheres .",
    "we generalize known exact solutions of the field equations with cosmological term and discuss their new properties .",
    "the principal result of the analysis is the increase of the radial sizes of matter spheres .",
    "this naturally lead to questions regarding the physical picture applicable to these solutions .",
    "analytical and numerical techniques are used to obtain a consistent picture of the underlying physics .    a positive cosmological constant",
    "can be regarded as an external force pulling matter apart .",
    "therefore , a ` large ' positive cosmological constant can increase the radius of a known perfect fluid solution such that it occupies more than just ` half ' of the three - space .",
    "the effects of the actual cosmological constant are very small and therefore one may ask why the investigation of solutions with ` large ' values of the cosmological term is beneficial . this can be answered from two points of view . from a mathematical point of view",
    "we deepen our understanding about exact solutions of einstein s field equations and the influence of the additional parameter @xmath0 .",
    "however , also from a physical point of view this study can be justified easily . in the bag model of hadrons",
    "@xcite the bag is stabilized by a term of the form @xmath1 , which has the same form as a cosmological constant , though its numerical value is considerably bigger @xmath2 , whereas we have @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the key physical motivation is the possibility that effects within stellar models can be effectively described by a term that looks like a cosmological constant , which can indeed have large effects .",
    "also in the context of boson stars  @xcite the matter energy - momentum tensor contains a part proportional to the metric which can be read as an effective cosmological term . within the context of loop quantum gravity",
    "it has recently been shown  @xcite that quantum gravity effects can be effectively of the form of a cosmological constant .",
    "apart from an equation of state relating the density @xmath4 to the pressure @xmath5 , a spherically symmetric perfect fluid has to satisfy only one condition , the pressure isotropy condition , requiring the equality of the radial and angular directional pressures . since this condition does not involve the cosmological constant @xmath0 , any solution with @xmath6 having an equation of state @xmath7 can also be interpreted as a @xmath8 cosmological solution with equation of state @xmath9 .",
    "it is one of the main purposes of the present paper to re - investigate known perfect fluid solutions with cosmological constant and to analyze whether these solutions for some special cosmological constant require the nariai metric as the exterior vacuum spacetime .",
    "we also try to construct solutions with two regular centers , i.e.  constructing more general einstein static universes , having neither constant energy density nor constant pressure .",
    "since the static and spherically symmetric field equations with more realistic equations of state in general can not be integrated analytically , we also use numerical methods to study perfect fluid spheres .",
    "in particular we will show that the effect of a ` large ' cosmological constant on polytropic perfect fluids is such that the matter is pulled sufficiently apart so that it occupies much of the three - space .",
    "the same result is also found by considering the stiff matter equation of state and also the hagedorn equation of state .",
    "however , realistic equations of state seem not to allow the presence of a second regular center . it is important to distinguish between coordinate and physical effects . for instance , one can not numerically integrate the constant density solutions for large cosmological constants if the original radius is used as a variable .",
    "the code breaks down at the equator of the three - sphere .",
    "this is a pure coordinate effect , since the coordinate system does not cover the whole spacetime .",
    "in order to distinguish coordinate and physical effects , also the riemann curvature tensor is considered .",
    "various other effects of the cosmological constant have been studied in the past , like the dynamical instability of perfect fluid spheres  @xcite , possibly detectable effects of the cosmological constant within our solar system  @xcite , and effects within astrophysical structures  @xcite .",
    "recently , the bending of light with @xmath0 has been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the paper is outlined in the following manner : in section  [ whitt ] we analytically study the effect of the cosmological constant on the whittaker and tolman @xmath10 solution , and also discuss the matching of the matter and the vacuum solution . in section  [ sec : analytic ] we derive conditions on the equation of state and the cosmological constant to characterize the different possible solutions . in section  [ sec : num ] we numerically integrate the field equations for realistic equations of state and find results consistent with our analytical results .",
    "we summarize and conclude our work in the final section  [ sec : concl ]",
    "in the present section the whittaker solution  @xcite and the tolman @xmath10 solution  @xcite are recalled . in both cases",
    "we firstly introduce a third angular coordinate @xmath11 , so that the coordinate system covers the complete three - space and not just ` half ' of it like the usual radial coordinate @xmath12 .",
    "secondly , we introduce the cosmological constant in the solutions and analyze its effect ( the ` external ' force due to @xmath0 ) on those solutions .",
    "we also explicitly show , how to join the interior and the exterior solution through the vanishing pressure surface .",
    "the whittaker solution is characterized by the relation @xmath13 between the energy density and the pressure , where @xmath14 is a positive constant .",
    "similarly to the constant density case this condition allows one to write down the solution to einstein s field equations in terms of elementary functions .",
    "the metric of the whittaker solution in the original schwarzschild coordinates reads  @xcite @xmath15dt^2 \\\\",
    "+ \\left[(1+b)(1-a^2r^2)-\\frac{b}{ar}(1-a^2r^2)^{3/2 }               \\arcsin(ar)\\right]^{-1}dr^2 + r^2d\\omega^2 ,        \\label{whitt1}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are constants",
    ". the special importance of the whittaker solution lies in the fact that it is the non - rotating static limit of the wahlquist solution  @xcite , the most important rotating perfect fluid exact solution .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 of the wahlquist solution is related to the parameter @xmath18 of the whittaker metric by @xmath20 .",
    "since the change of the parameter @xmath21 corresponds merely to a rescaling of the coordinate @xmath22 , we set @xmath23 . after introducing a new radial coordinate , the third angle @xmath11 , by @xmath24 , metric  ( [ whitt1 ] ) simplifies to @xmath25 although the introduced radial coordinate @xmath11 is very similar to the third angle of the ellipsoid used for the interior schwarzschild solution , the spatial metric is not ellipsoidal in this case because of the non constant nature of the metric component @xmath26 . on the other hand",
    ", it should be emphasized that the @xmath27 hypersurfaces are round two - spheres .",
    "therefore , the topology of the three - space essentially depends on the function @xmath26 . in the above mentioned constant density case ,",
    "the three - space is in fact a three - sphere .",
    "when we discuss next the modified tolman @xmath10 solution the three - space will be ellipsoidal .",
    "the introduction of the new radial coordinate @xmath11 is important in all cases where there is a group orbit with maximum area , since in these cases the usual radial coordinate only covers the region up the this maximum orbit .",
    "henceforth we will refer to the coordinate @xmath11 as the third angle .",
    "it is possible to express the constant in the equation of state @xmath28 in terms of the constants in the metric and the cosmological constant by @xmath29 positivity of the pressure and density implies @xmath30 , which we require from now on , by assuming @xmath31 if there is a spherical surface where the solution is matched to a schwarzschild - de sitter ( or schwarzschild anti - de sitter ) exterior region , then @xmath5 must go to zero at the surface , and the fluid density becomes @xmath14 there .    the pressure and energy density of the whittaker solution",
    "are given by @xmath32 the central pressure and central energy density can be derived from equations  ( [ whitt_p ] ) and  ( [ whitt_rho ] ) by noting that @xmath33 and read @xmath34 requiring both to be positive we get @xmath35 . since at the center @xmath36 and @xmath37 ,",
    "the pressure is maximal at the center if and only if @xmath38 . since in the @xmath39 case",
    "there is no zero pressure surface , we assume @xmath38 in the present discussion .",
    "the equator , where the area of the spheres of symmetry is maximal , is located at @xmath40 .",
    "there @xmath41 and for the equatorial pressure @xmath42 and density @xmath43",
    "we get @xmath44    let us now choose the cosmological constant such that the pressure vanishes at the equator , @xmath45 in  ( [ whitt_pi2 ] ) , which yields @xmath46 hence for solutions which satisfy the relation @xmath47 , the pressure vanishes before the equator , where the group orbits are still increasing .",
    "one should check whether the choice @xmath48 is compatible with the positivity of pressure and energy density at the center , and also with the positivity of energy density at the equator ( otherwise these solutions would not be physical ) .",
    "positivity of energy density at the surface is ensured by ( [ rho0pos ] ) , which now takes the form @xmath49 . using @xmath50 in ( [ whitt_cen ] ) and ( [ rho0 ] ) we get @xmath51 all the three conditions are satisfied if @xmath52 .    for larger cosmological constants ,",
    "i.e.  for @xmath53 , the pressure vanishes after the equator of the ellipsoid , where the group orbits are decreasing . since the pressure function @xmath54 as @xmath55 there always exists a zero pressure surface at which one joins on the schwarzschild - de sitter metric as an exterior vacuum spacetime .",
    "therefore the whittaker solution can not have a second regular center .",
    "since the derivative of the function @xmath56 is positive for @xmath57 in the case @xmath38 , the function @xmath56 remains positive , consequently the coordinate system and the metric remains regular in the whole fluid region .",
    "as already outlined in the introduction we will explicitly show that the choice @xmath48 necessitates the nariai metric as the exterior spacetime .",
    "since the pressure in this case vanishes at the maximum of the area of the group orbits the exterior spacetime must have constant area spheres of symmetry , which excludes the schwarzschild - de sitter or anti - de sitter spacetimes .",
    "the only other static and spherically symmetric vacuum spacetime with cosmological constant is indeed the nariai spacetime , and its group orbits have constant area .",
    "here we review the necessary conditions for matching a spherically symmetric static perfect fluid solution to an exterior vacuum region .",
    "we write the metric in both regions in the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are functions of the coordinate @xmath12 .",
    "a metric written in this form have a center where @xmath62 , and this center is regular , i.e. free of conical singularities , if the area of small spheres is proportional to their radius square , with the appropriate proportionality factor , @xmath63 .",
    "the regularity of the four - metric also requires a finite value for @xmath59 and @xmath64 at the central point .",
    "we assume that the matching is performed along the hypersurface described by @xmath65 . the darmois - israel matching conditions  @xcite essentially state that the induced metric and the extrinsic curvature have to agree on the hypersurfaces used for joining the two solutions .",
    "the outward pointing normal vector to the symmetry surfaces has the components @xmath66 .",
    "the induced metric @xmath67 can be expressed using the spacetime metric as @xmath68 , while the extrinsic curvature can be calculated as @xmath69 , where @xmath70 denotes the covariant derivative associated to the spacetime metric @xmath71 . using the coordinate system @xmath72 on the matching surface",
    ", the induced metric @xmath67 has the form @xmath73 while the components of the extrinsic curvature are @xmath74 from  ( [ hab ] ) it is apparent that the induced metric agrees if and only if the value of @xmath61 and @xmath59 agrees on the matching surfaces .",
    "then the extrinsic curvatures are matched appropriately if and only if @xmath75 and @xmath76 agrees .",
    "the agreement of @xmath61 has the obvious physical meaning of equal area matching spheres , while the equality of @xmath59 can always be ensured by appropriate rescaling the time coordinate in the interior fluid domain .",
    "if we use gauss coordinates in both domain then @xmath77 and the matching of the extrinsic curvature is equivalent to the continuity of the first derivative of @xmath59 and @xmath61 .",
    "however , in general , it is also possible to give coordinate system invariant meaning to these conditions .    the invariant mass function in spherically symmetric cosmological spacetimes can be defined as @xmath78 for vanishing cosmological constant this gives back the usual mass definition given in @xcite . for the metric form  ( [ matchds ] ) we get @xmath79        - \\frac{\\lambda}{6}r^3 .",
    "\\label{anmass}\\ ] ] from this we can see that if @xmath80 agrees on the two matching surfaces of equal area then @xmath76 must also be the same . the other invariant quantity is the pressure at the matching surface , which for the metric ( [ matchds ] ) takes the form @xmath81 it is apparent that if @xmath61 and @xmath76 both agree on the matching surfaces and @xmath82 then @xmath75 will be the same if and only if the pressures are the same .",
    "consequently , if @xmath82 , the matching of two static perfect fluid solutions can be done at two chosen spherical surfaces if and only if the surfaces has the same area , the mass function has the same value , and the pressures agrees as well .",
    "obviously , if the exterior domain is a vacuum , then the fluid pressure at the surface must vanish .",
    "it is interesting that in case of a nariai exterior @xmath83 and the @xmath84 condition is not enough to ensure the continuity of @xmath76 .",
    "the quantity @xmath75 is closely related to the acceleration of static non - rotating observers staying at constant radius @xmath12 . in the coordinate system",
    "@xmath85 used in these observers have the velocity vector @xmath86 .",
    "the only non - vanishing component of their acceleration vector @xmath87 is @xmath88 .",
    "the norm of the acceleration is @xmath89 .",
    "this shows that apart from a possible signature change the continuity of the magnitude of the acceleration implies the continuity of @xmath75 in the matching condition .      for cosmological constants satisfying @xmath47 the area of the group orbits at the @xmath84 surface is increasing and we join the schwarzschild - de sitter ( or schwarzschild anti - de sitter for @xmath90 ) metric on as the exterior vacuum spacetime .",
    "since the cosmological constant is fixed by the specific solution it remains to choose the mass appropriately . in the schwarzschild area coordinate @xmath61 the mass is defined by @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is defined by @xmath93 . by using gauss coordinates relative to the @xmath94 hypersurfaces the metric is @xmath95 at the boundary .",
    "if the energy density is non - vanishing at the boundary this can not be improved . after placing one object in the schwarzschild - de sitter spacetime",
    ", it still contains an infinite series of singularities .",
    "however , by placing a second object appropriately in that spacetime , it is possible to construct a singularity - free spacetime , see fig .",
    "[ fig : penrosea ] .",
    "this possibility has been discussed earlier in greater detail in  @xcite .    for @xmath96",
    "we explicitely show the matching of the interior perfect fluid spacetime with the exterior nariai spacetime .",
    "we follow the generic discussion of matching two static and spherically symmetric regions presented in the previous subsection .",
    "we read off and compare at the matching surface the corresponding functions @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 in the general form of the line element .",
    "recall that the static form of the nariai metric is given by @xcite @xmath97 we note that this form of the metric is not homogeneous , since the static observers described by constant @xmath98 are not equivalent .",
    "the magnitude of their acceleration is @xmath99 .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , this acceleration is towards the @xmath100 surface , since the non - vanishing component of their acceleration , given by @xmath101 , is negative for @xmath102",
    ".    the metric functions of the nariai spacetime in the coordinate system are given by @xmath103 the corresponding functions in the whittaker fluid region are @xmath104 where @xmath56 is given by .",
    "the agreement of the induced metric , i.e.  the matching of @xmath61 and @xmath59 implies @xmath105 the condition @xmath106 implies @xmath40 for the matching surface in the fluid region . from this",
    "it follows that @xmath50 , which is just the condition of vanishing pressure at the equator of the whittaker solution .",
    "the remaining matching condition @xmath107 yields @xmath108",
    "so if gauss coordinates are used , i.e.  @xmath77 , we explicitly showed the matching of the interior and the exterior metric to be of degree @xmath95 ( @xmath59 , @xmath61 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 all agree on the zero pressure surface ) .",
    "this differentiability condition can not be improved when the equation of state of the fluid constrains the energy density at the boundary to be positive . in this case",
    "the energy - momentum tensor jumps at the boundary and the metric is at most @xmath95 .",
    "figure  [ fig : penrosec ] shows the penrose diagram of this spacetime .",
    "lastly , for cosmological constants satisfying @xmath53 the group orbits at the @xmath84 surfaces are _ decreasing _ and we join the schwarzschild - de sitter metric on as the exterior vacuum spacetime . since the cosmological constant",
    "is fixed by the specific solution it remains to choose the mass appropriately , see the discussion above . by using gauss",
    "coordinates the metric is @xmath95 at the boundary .",
    "if the energy density is non - vanishing at the boundary this can not be improved .",
    "it is important to note that the vacuum part of this spacetime contains the singularity at the origin @xmath111 and that the matter occupies the outer region of the spacetime , see penrose diagram  [ fig : penroseb ] , where a second object was inserted in the spacetime to remove the infinite sequence of singularities present in the schwarzschild - de sitter diagram .      in principle , the above discussion can now be repeated for all the 127 candidate solutions presented in  @xcite ( of which only 60% are isotropic and regular at the center ) .",
    "for all those one could check whether the inclusion of the cosmological constant can pull the matter up to or beyond the equator of the corresponding ellipsoid .",
    "we will , however , only repeat this analysis for the tolman @xmath10 solution .",
    "this particular choice is motivated by the simplicity of the solution which also allows to analytically express its equation of state .",
    "we now take a fresh look at the tolman @xmath10 solution  @xcite .",
    "its metric reads @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath61 are positive constants . introducing the third angle by @xmath114 yields @xmath115 .",

    "eliminating the variable @xmath11 from eqs .",
    "( [ tolmanp ] ) and  ( [ tolmanr ] ) leads to the following equation of state @xmath119 where the three constants @xmath120 are given by @xmath121    as in the previous discussion let us now compute the value of the pressure and density at the first center @xmath122 , at the equator of the ellipsoid @xmath123 and at the second possible center @xmath124 , which yields @xmath125 similarly to the whittaker case there exists a cosmological constant such that the pressure vanishes at the equator @xmath126 where the energy density is positive . in this case one",

    "however , the pressure can not vanish after the equator , as can be seen from the mirror symmetry to the equator of the solution .",
    "therefore , solutions with @xmath53 have two centers .",
    "one easily verifies that both centers are regular by checking that the derivatives of pressure and energy density vanish at both centers . hence ,",
    "as a side result we already found a new generalization of the einstein static universe .",
    "the einstein universe is characterized by its constant energy energy and constant pressure ( originally einstein assumed a pressure - less universe ) throughout the three - sphere . by a generalization of the einstein static universe we mean a globally regular solution of the field equations with cosmological constant where the spatial part of the metric is a closed three - space and where either the energy density or the pressure , or both are varying .",
    "it is expected that other known perfect fluid solutions , e.g.  those given in ref .",
    "@xcite , will show similar properties .",
    "therefore , following the above procedure , we can explicitely show the existence of a wide class of generalized einstein static universes and an even wider class of static and spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions , for which the pressure vanishes in regions where the group orbits are decreasing .",
    "in the previous sections we analyzed perfect fluid solutions which may extend through the equator of the ellipsoid that describes the global geometry of the spatial hypersurfaces . the present section supplements the explicit and later numerical results by presenting some general statements . it should also be mentioned that the existence and uniqueness of perfect fluid solutions was proved in  @xcite .",
    "the restrictions on the equations of state could be weakened in refs .",

    "indeed , this condition simply states that the equator is a local maximum of the group orbits area .",
    "this fact was not assumed explicitely and is a direct consequence of assuming physical solutions : positivity of the energy density .",
    "the above analysis clarifies under which conditions static and spherically symmetric perfect fluid ellipsoids may extend through the equator and have a zero pressure surface in regions where the area of the group orbits is decreasing .",

    "next we find a necessary condition for a positive pressure at the equator .",
    "let us assume @xmath162 .",
    "then the integral of @xmath163 is non negative . since going outwards @xmath5 and @xmath4 are monotonically decreasing it follows that @xmath164 .",

    "these three observations can be summarized as follows @xmath171 which only depend on the equation of state and the initial conditions .",
    "however , these conditions only yield quite general conclusions .",
    "they do not suffice to decide whether the solution can have a second regular center , i.e.  perfect fluid solutions which occupy the whole ellipsoid . from equation  ( [ a3a ] ) we can conclude that the pressure is increasing near the first regular center if we assume @xmath172 , however , we can not control the further behavior of the solution and may obtain a singular solution where the pressure diverges , or a solution with a second center having a conical singularity .",
    "let us furthermore discuss the consequences of having a regular center .",
    "regularity of the solution at the center in particular fixes some of the coefficients in the power series expansion of the function @xmath134 , see e.g.  @xcite , which are given by @xmath173 however , the part @xmath174 is also determined by the initial conditions , as can be seen from the first field equation  ( [ an2 ] ) @xmath175 after applying the rule of lhopital and using the relations  ( [ a9 ] ) we arrive at @xmath176 so that also the third derivative is fixed by the initial conditions . in case",
    "there exists a second regular center @xmath177 we have @xmath178 so that @xmath179 is given by @xmath180 the conditions  ( [ a9 ] ) , ( [ a11 ] ) and also  ( [ a12 ] ) , ( [ a13 ] ) must be satisfied independently by any solution admitting two regular centers .",
    "while one prescribes initial conditions at the first center , the regularity of the second center is by no means warranted since it actually depends on the solution of the function @xmath61 together with the equation of state that also enter  ( [ a13 ] ) .    in the next section",
    "we will analyze the field equations numerically for given equations of state .",
    "it will turn out that none of the equations of state considered allows a second regular center .",
    "therefore , all solutions that have an increasing pressure near the first center will have either a divergent pressure , or a second center with a conical singularity , and are hence not of physical interest in general .",
    "in sections  [ subsec : whitt ] and  [ tolman ] we generalized two known solutions to include the cosmological constant . for large cosmological constant we found that new properties arise like the possibility of having a second regular center . in the previous analytic section we presented some arguments in favor of the existence of solutions with cosmological constant that may occupy more than ` half ' the three space .",
    "this result can also be read in the flowing way : for sufficiently large cosmological constants the pressure can not vanish before the equator of the three space , so that some new physical properties may arise . however , it was also argued that in general a second regular center does not exist .",
    "it is the aim of the present section to solve the field equations  ( [ an2])([an4 ] ) numerically for a given equation of state @xmath181 .",
    "in particular we are interested in solutions where the pressure vanishes after the group orbit s maximum of the three space and in solutions that possibly have two regular centers .",
    "we concentrate on these two classes of solutions , since the others are well known already .",
    "the most natural starting point for the numerical analysis are the polytropic equations of state @xmath182 where @xmath183 is some constant and @xmath21 is the polytropic index . in the newtonian case",
    "stellar models are finite if @xmath184 and do not have a finite radius for @xmath185 , where also @xmath6 is assumed .",
    "we slightly modify the polytropic equations of state , in order to allow a non - vanishing boundary density @xmath186 .",
    "hence , we consider the following equation of state @xmath187 where the boundary density is a new free parameter that we must specify .",
    "we chose @xmath188 , the polytropic index @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "for two different cosmological constant ( ` small ' and ` large ' ) we obtain the two following solutions , fig .  [ fig : poly]a and fig .",
    "[ fig : poly]b .",
    "as expected , for small cosmological constant , see fig .",
    "[ fig : poly]a , the pressure vanishes before the maximum of the group orbits . at the vanishing pressure surface one can join on the schwarzschild - de sitter metric @xmath95 as the exterior spacetime , with the methods described in subsection  [ subsec : match ] .",
    "these solutions are represented by the carter - penrose diagram  [ fig : penrosea ] discussed earlier . for large cosmological constant",
    "however , see fig  [ fig : poly]b , the pressure vanishes after the maximum , in a region where the group orbits are decreasing .",
    "this would necessarily yield a global solution represented by the carter - penrose diagram  [ fig : penroseb ] , where the exterior spacetime contains the singularity .",
    "since the numerical solutions vary smoothly in the cosmological constant , it is evident that a fine tuned cosmological constant can be chosen such that the pressure vanishes exactly at the maximum of the group orbits , in which case one has to join the nariai metric as the exterior spacetime .",
    "next , let us analyze the solutions for the stiff matter equation of state ( the @xmath191 limit of the polytropic equation of state ) @xmath192 which we , as before , supplemented by a boundary density term @xmath193 . for the stiff matter case we again take two different values of the cosmological constant .",
    "the results are similar to those discussed already , see fig .",
    "[ fig : stiffa]a and fig .",
    "[ fig : stiffa]b .",
    "finally let us consider the hagedorn equation of state @xmath194 where the free parameter @xmath195 is related to the boundary density by @xmath196 .",
    "as in the previously discussed cases , we find that for ` small ' cosmological constants the pressure vanishes before the maximum of the group orbits , whereas ` large ' values of the cosmological constant allow the pressure to vanish after the maximum , see fig .",
    "[ fig : hage]a and fig .",
    "[ fig : hage]b .    apart from the incompressible perfect fluid case we could not find numerically any other configuration with a second regular center .",
    "this indicates that the existence of the second center requires a very specific choice of the fluid s equation of state and carefully chosen initial conditions .",
    "we have used analytical and numerical techniques to analyze the static and spherically perfect fluid field equations of general relativity in the presence of a cosmological constant .",
    "a positive cosmological term can be viewed as an external force having the effect of pulling matter apart .",
    "hence , one can expect that the radial size of matter spheres is increased due to @xmath0 .",
    "this naturally yields questions regarding the physical picture applicable to these solutions .",
    "it turns out that the effects of the cosmological constant lead to various different configurations , many of which have not been discussed previously .    by using gauss coordinates relative to the @xmath197 hypersurfaces , we analyzed geometrically the properties of the vanishing pressure surface that determines the boundary of the perfect fluid sphere . in the absence of the cosmological constant , going outwards",
    ", the area of the respective group orbits are always increasing close to the zero pressure surface .",
    "this situation changes drastically if @xmath0 is allowed to be relatively large in comparison with the matter density .",
    "it is possible for the pressure to vanish exactly at the maximum of the group orbits or even vanish where the group orbits are decreasing . in the first case one has to join on the nariai solution to get the metric @xmath95 at boundary . in the latter case one matches the part of the schwarzschild - de sitter solution containing the black hole horizon and the singularity .",
    "this is in contrast to the the small @xmath0 situation where the vacuum region contains the cosmological horizon .",
    "lastly , one is lead to ask whether the matter can occupy the whole spacetime resulting in two regular centers corresponding to a fully generalized einstein static universe where neither the energy density nor the pressure are constant .",
    "we showed that the whittaker solution can have its vanishing pressure surface where the group orbits are decreasing , however , a second center is not possible . on the other hand ,",
    "the tolman @xmath10 solution does allow for a second regular center , a solution that might be named tolman @xmath10 einstein universe . by numerically integrating the field equations for physically motivated equations of state we showed that in general the pressure can vanish where the group orbits are decreasing and consequently at the maximum for sufficiently fine tuned initial conditions .",
    "we also obtained analytical bounds that the cosmological constant has to satisfy to allow for such situations .",
    "however , we were not able to show , that in general , solutions with two regular centers for a given equation of state exist .",
    "this observation has analytical support since the conditions under which the solutions have two regular centers are very restrictive .",
    "note however , that the special tolman @xmath10 equation of state  ( [ eom : tolman ] ) admits solutions with a second regular center .",
    "ever since the first exact matter solutions have been obtained , static and spherically symmetric perfect fluid spacetimes have remained a subject of great interest .",
    "the presence of matter that effectively acts like a perfect fluid with unusual equations of state , such as @xmath198 , drastically changes the geometry of known solutions .",
    "we thank pter forgcs and roy maartens for the useful discussions .",
    "gf has been supported by otka grants no .",
