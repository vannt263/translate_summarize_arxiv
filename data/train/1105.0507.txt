    "the concept of _ @xmath1-pair _ in a @xmath3-coloured graph was introduced for the first time by sostenes lins in @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , it consists of two equally coloured edges , which belong to two or three bicoloured cycles . a graph with no @xmath1-pairs",
    "was then called _ rigid _ in the same paper , where the following basic result was proved :    _ every handle - free , closed @xmath4-manifold admits a rigid crystallization of minimal order . _    the proof is based on the definition of a particular local move , called _ switching _ of a @xmath1-pair . starting from any gem @xmath5 of a closed , irreducible @xmath4-manifold @xmath6 , a finite sequence of such moves , together with the cancelling of a suitable number of @xmath7-dipoles , produces a rigid crystallization @xmath8 of the same manifold @xmath6 , whose order is strictly less than the order of @xmath5 .",
