    "in the present paper we continue the investigation of new quantum systems originating from the representation theory of basic classical lie superalgebras .",
    "in particular , we study further the properties of a 3-dimensional ( 3d ) wigner quantum oscillator whose mathematical background involves the lie superalgebra @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the idea itself behind these investigations stems from the 1950 s paper of wigner _ do the equations of motion determine the quantum mechanical commutation relations ?",
    "_  @xcite . in this paper wigner has generalized a result of ehrenfest  @xcite . the latter stated ( up to ordering details , which are irrelevant in our case ) that in the heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics hamilton s ( resp .",

    "hamilton s ) equations .",
    "wigner has proved a stronger statement .",
    "he has shown through an example that hamilton s equations can be identical to the heisenberg equations even if the position and momentum operators do not satisfy the ccrs .",
    "the above considerations justify the following definition  @xcite :    a system with hamiltonian = _",
    "= 1^n _ ^2 + v ( _ 1 , _ 2 ,  , _",
    "n ) , [ 1.1 ] which depends on the @xmath13 variables @xmath14 and @xmath15 , with @xmath16 , to be interpreted as ( cartesian ) coordinates and momenta , respectively , is said to be a wigner quantum system ( wqs ) if the following conditions hold :    * the state space @xmath17 is a hilbert space . to every physical observable @xmath18 there corresponds a hermitian ( self - adjoint ) operator @xmath19 acting in @xmath17 .",
    "* the observable @xmath18 can take on only those values which are eigenvalues of @xmath19 .",
    "the expectation value of the observable @xmath18 in a state @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes the scalar product of @xmath23 .",
    "* hamilton s equations and the heisenberg equations hold and are identical ( as operator equations ) in @xmath17 .",
    "postulates * p1 * and * p2 * are common to any quantum system .",
    "the difference with canonical quantum mechanics comes from the last postulate * p3*. in the canonical case instead of * p3 * one postulates the validity of the heisenberg equations and the ccrs , then as mentioned above , hamilton s equations hold too",
    ".    in  @xcite wigner has considered , as an example of such a system , a one - dimensional oscillator with a hamiltonian ( @xmath24 ) @xmath25 . abandoning the requirement @xmath26=i$ ] , wigner searched for all operators @xmath27 and @xmath28 such that hamilton s equations @xmath29 and @xmath30 are identical with the heisenberg equations @xmath31 $ ] and @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "in addition to the canonical solution he found infinitely many other solutions .",
    "different aspects of wigner s idea were studied by several authors . among the earlier references we mention  @xcite , but",
    "the subject still remains of interest  @xcite .",
    "it is perhaps worth mentioning that postulate * p3 * can be weakened ( so far only in the 1d case ) in a manner consistent with wigner s ideas  @xcite so that deformed quantum oscillators  @xcite and , more generally , daskaloyannis oscillators  @xcite can be viewed as ( generalized ) wigner oscillators .",
    "our approach to wigner quantum oscillators is essentially based on two observations .",
    "the first one , due to kamefuchi and ohnuki  @xcite , is the proof that all solutions found by wigner are different representations of _ just one pair _ of para - bose ( pb ) creation and annihilation operators ( caos ) @xmath33 .",
    "more generally , we recall that the ( representation independent ) pb operators , which generalize bose statistics , are defined by the relations  @xcite : = ( -)_ijb_s^+(-)_jkb_r^ ,  i , j , k=1,2, ",
    ",n ,  , , =  1 . [ 1.2 ] here and throughout the paper @xmath34 and @xmath35=xy - yx$ ] for any @xmath36 .",
    "the second relevant observation is that any @xmath37 pairs of pb operators @xmath38 are odd elements , generating a lie superalgebra  @xcite , isomorphic to the orthosymplectic lie superalgebra @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "the fock spaces of any @xmath37 pairs of parabosons and in particular of bosons are irreducible @xmath39 modules . in this terminology",
    "the oscillator of wigner can be called @xmath40 oscillator , its position and momentum operators are the odd generators of @xmath40 , the hamiltonian is a simple polynomial of the position and momentum operators and the solutions found by wigner are different irreducible representations of this lie superalgebra .",
    "the @xmath39 lie superalgebra is a basic classical lie superalgebra from class @xmath41 in the classification of kac  @xcite .",
    "in fact  ( [ 1.2 ] ) yields one possible definition of @xmath39 : the associative superalgebra with unity , subject to the relations  ( [ 1.2 ] ) is the universal enveloping algebra of @xmath39 .    the results of wigner can be easily extended to any @xmath37-dimensional harmonic oscillator , turning it into a wigner quantum oscillator ( wqo ) . to this end",
    "one has first to express the hamiltonian via bose operators [ b_i^-,b_j^+]=_ij = [ b_i^-,b_j^-]=0 ,    i , j=1, ",
    ",n , [ 1.3 ] and their anticommutators and subsequently replace them with pb operators  ( [ 1.2 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding solutions are now associated with infinite - dimensional irreducible representation of the lie superalgebra @xmath39 . since",
    "this superalgebra is of class @xmath41 we refer to the statistics of the canonical quantum oscillator ( cqo ) ( and its pb generalization ) as being @xmath41-superstatistics .    having observed all this , it was natural to ask whether one can satisfy the postulates of definition  1 with position and momentum operators which generate algebras from the other , different from @xmath41 , classes of basic lie superalgebras .",
    "a positive answer to this question was given in  @xcite with operators @xmath42 which satisfy certain relations that we will specify in the next section .",
    "these ensure that they generate the lie superalgebra @xmath43 .",
    "the corresponding solutions are this time associated with a wigner quantum system that takes the form of an @xmath37-dimensional _ non - canonical _ wigner quantum oscillator .",
    "since the special linear lie superalgebra @xmath43 is of class @xmath44 we refer to the statistics of this wqo as being @xmath44-superstatistics .    in a similar approach barut and bracken  @xcite",
    "have described the internal dynamics ( _ zitterbewegung _ ) of dirac s electron .",
    "their creation and annihilation operators satisfy similar triple relations as in our case ( eqs .",
    "( [ 2.11 ] ) ) , but instead of a lie superalgebra they generate the lie algebra @xmath45 .",
    "in the present paper we study further the properties of the 3d wqo , related to the @xmath0 superalgebra and initiated in  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "in section  2 we outline the mathematical structure of the 3d noncanonical oscillator .",
    "the compatibility between the heisenberg equations and the hamilton s equations is achieved with operators @xmath46 which satisfy triple relations similar to those for the para - bose case  ( [ 1.2 ] ) , but this time they generate the lie superalgebra @xmath0 .",
    "the fock spaces @xmath47 of these operators are defined .",
    "the inequivalent representations are labeled by one positive integer  @xmath48 . for @xmath5",
    "all fock spaces are 8-dimensional , whereas in the case @xmath49 ( resp .",
    "@xmath50 ) @xmath51 ( resp .",
    "@xmath52 ) . in the terminology of kac  @xcite the @xmath10 representations",
    "are called atypical representations . for this reason",
    "we refer to the fock spaces @xmath12 and @xmath11 as to atypical , to the corresponding oscillator as to atypical etc .",
    "we shall see in the next sections that the properties of the atypical oscillators are very different from those with @xmath5 .",
    "in section  3 we recall the known  @xcite physical properties of the @xmath0 wqos .",
    "firstly , the oscillator has finite space dimensions and the hamiltonian has no more than 4 different eigenvalues . in the stationary states",
    "the distance of the particle to the origin is quantized so that the particle is constrained to move on one of 4 possible spheres . secondly",
    ", the geometry of the oscillator is noncommutative .",
    "neither coordinates nor the momenta commute with each other .",
    "therefore the position of the particle on the corresponding sphere can not be localized . in this respect",
    "the wqo belongs to the class of models of noncommutative quantum oscillators  @xcite and , more generally , to theories with noncommutative geometry  @xcite .",
    "the literature on the subject is vast .",
    "moreover the subject is not any longer of purely theoretical interest .",
    "most recently papers predicting ( experimentally ) measurable deviations from the commutativity of the coordinates have been published  @xcite .",
    "all results after section  3 are new . in section  4",
    "the probabilistic distribution of the particle is analyzed .",
    "the basis consists of stationary states .",
    "the main result is the following : if the particle is in one of the basis states with @xmath5 , then measurements of its coordinates are consistent with it only being found at 8 particular points on a sphere which form the vertices of a rectangular parallelepiped ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "thus as in  @xcite , the coordinates of the particle are observables with a quantized spectrum just like energy , angular momentum , etc .",
    "the number of the points , called `` nests '' , can be even less in the atypical cases . in certain states with @xmath50",
    "the oscillator is becoming a flat object with 4 vertices ( figure  2 ) .",
    "there are three states in the @xmath49 case when the oscillator is even one - dimensional ( figure  3 ) . in section  5",
    "the mean trajectories and the standard deviations of the position and momenta operators for an arbitrary state are written down .",
    "it is shown ( conclusion  3 ) that there exists no nontrivial analogue of the heisenberg uncertainty relations since one can always find a state @xmath53 for which either @xmath54 or @xmath55 .    in section  6",
    "we show that despite the fact that the @xmath0 oscillator is very different from the 3d bose oscillator , they still have some features in common .",
    "in particular we show that to each @xmath49 mean trajectory of the @xmath0 oscillator there corresponds exactly the same trajectory of the 3-dimensional canonical oscillator . finally ,",
    "in section  7 , we discuss the rotational invariance of the wqo .",
    "let @xmath56 be the hamiltonian of a three - dimensional harmonic oscillator , that is = ^2 2 m + m^22 ^ 2 .",
    "[ 2.1 ] we proceed to view this oscillator as a wigner quantum system and work throughout in the heisenberg picture in which the operators are , in general , time dependent .",
    "according to postulate * p3 * the operators @xmath57 and @xmath58 have to be defined in such a way that hamilton s equations = -m^2 ,   = 1m[2.2 ] and the heisenberg equations = i[h , ] ,   = i[h , ] [ 2.3 ] are both valid , and are identical as operator equations .",
    "these equations are compatible only if [ h,]=im ^2 ,   [ h,]=-i . [ 2.4 ]    the most general solution of  ( [ 2.2 ] ) and  ( [ 2.3 ] ) is not known .",
    "here we mention the canonical bose solution . expressed via boson creation and annihilation operators",

    "for which the position and momentum operators generate a lie superalgebra from the class @xmath44 , more precisely @xmath0 . to make the connection with @xmath0 we write the operators @xmath62 and @xmath63 in terms of new operators : a_k^= _ k _ k , k=1,2,3 .

    "note the first big difference between this non - canonical wqo and the case of a conventional cqo :    contrary to the cqo with an infinite - dimensional state space , each state space @xmath47 of the wqo is finite - dimensional .",

    "here we recall the physical properties of the wigner quantum oscillators as given in  @xcite .",
    "the first thing we note is that the representation of @xmath0 was chosen such that , as in the case of a 3d cqo , the physical observables @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath82 are , in the case of the wqo , all hermitian operators within every hilbert space @xmath47 for each @xmath94 ( in accordance with postulate * p1 * ) .",

    "note that in the atypical cases ( @xmath10 ) the lowest energy level is degenerate : there are three linearly independent states with the same ground state energy .",
    "perhaps the most striking difference between the wqo and the cqo is that the geometry of the wigner oscillators is noncommutative : the position operators @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 of the oscillating particle do not commute with each other , 0 ij=1,2,3 .",
    "[ 3.3 ] hence for the wigner oscillators _ a coordinate representation ( @xmath53-representation ) does not exist_. similarly , 0 ij=1,2,3 [ 3.4 ] and therefore also _ a momentum representation ( @xmath48-representation ) can not be defined_.        for @xmath107 .",

    "for further references we formulate the following observation .",
    "each stationary state @xmath97 , which is a superposition of states @xmath95 with one and the same @xmath109 , corresponds to a configuration in which the particle is somewhere at a distance @xmath4 from the centre of the coordinate system .",

    "thus the wqo occupies a finite volume .",
    "the oscillating particle is locked in a sphere with radius  ( [ 3.8 ] ) , which is another property very different from the cqo for which there is no finite upper bound on the radial distance .",
