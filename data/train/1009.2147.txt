    "intrinsic shapes and orientations of the individual elliptical galaxies have been investigated by binney ( 1985 ) , tenjes et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , statler ( 1994a , b ) , bak and statler ( 2000 ) , statler ( 2001 ) and statler et al .",
    "these authors have used the kinematical data and the photometric data , and have used the triaxial models with the density distribution @xmath0 , where @xmath1 with constant axial ratios @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "it was shown analytically that the projected density of such a distribution @xmath0 is stratified on similar and co - aligned ellipses ( stark 1977 , binney 1985 ) .",
    "statler ( 1994a , b , hereafter s94a , s94b ) uses ( apart from the kinematial data ) a constant value of ellipticity , which is an average over a suitably chosen range of the radial distance , for the shape and the orientation estimates .",
    "the shape estimates are robust , and are described by a pair of shape parameters , namely the short to long axial ratio of the light distribution and the triaxiality of the mass distribution .",
    "the orientations are described by the euler angles which define the orientation of the galaxies relative to the line of sight .",
    "the methodology is based on bayesian statistics , and is described in s94a , s94b , and more recently in statler et al .",
    "the likelihood of obtaining the data from a model in a chosen orientation is a function of the orientation parameters and the shape parameters .",
    "the likelihood is multiplied by a model for the parent distribution of these parameters ( the prior ) , and integrated over the parameters that one is not trying to constrain .",
    "the normalized result is the posterior probability distribution for the parameters of interest .",
    "probability of the shape is obtained by integrating over the uninteresting orientation parameters , and likewise , probability of the orientation is obtained by integrating over the shape parameters .",
    "the shape and orientation thus evaluated do not constitute a simultaneous fit to the data ; they are , in fact , mutually exclusive ( s94a ) .",
    "chakraborty et al .",
    "( 2008 , hereafter c08 ) have demonstrated that the variation in the intrinsic shapes of the light distribution of elliptical galaxies can be determined by using the photometric data alone .",
    "they use the models with varying axial ratios ( chakraborty 2004 ) and the triaxial models discussed by dezeeuw and carollo ( 1996 ) .",
    "these models exhibit ellipticity variation and position angle twist .",
    "they use ellipticities @xmath4 , @xmath5 and the position angle difference @xmath6 at two suitably chosen points @xmath7 and @xmath8 from the profiles of the photometric data of the galaxies .",
    "the intrinsic shape is described by the parameters @xmath9 , where @xmath10 are short to long axial ratios ( triaxialities ) at small and at large radii , respectively .",
    "they find that the best constrained shapes parameters are the axial ratios @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and the absolute value of the triaxial difference @xmath13 defined as @xmath14 .",
    "the methodology adopted in c08 is essentially the same as described in s94a with necessary modifications to suit the requirements .",
    "we now take up the complementary problem .",
    "we determine a statistical estimate of the orientation of the light distribution of the galaxies using photometric data .",
    "we consider the usual polar coordinates @xmath15 of the line of sight , with respect to the principle axes of the galaxy , to define the orientation .",
    "we use ellipticities @xmath4 , @xmath5 and the position angle difference @xmath16 , as in c08 , and calculate the likelihood of obtaining the data from a model in a chosen orientation .",
    "we consider a flat parent distribution @xmath17 = constant ( flat prior ) and multiply it with the likelihood to obtain the posterior density .",
    "integrating the posterior density over the shape parameters , we obtain the marginal posterior density @xmath18 describing the statistical estimate of the orientation .",
    "it is necessary that the marginal posterior density should be likelihood dominated , and not prior dominated .",
    "the prior , which is considered as flat in the present investigation , may be replaced by an improved or modified prior when the results of a large sample of galaxies are available .",
    "modified prior is estimated and used in bak and statler ( 2000 ) .    although it is the posterior density which constitutes the result of the bayesian estimates , some statistical summary is also useful for its description .",
    "area of the parameter space enclosing @xmath19 of the total probability , which can be interpreted as @xmath20 error bar is one such useful quantity . a working definition of a good likelihood",
    "dominated estimate is that the @xmath21 region ( area enclosing @xmath22 of the total probability ) should be less than @xmath23 of the total parameter space ( s94a ) .",
    "another useful quantity is the location @xmath24 of the maximum probability .    in the present investigation",
    ", we consider the triaxial galaxies under study to have very simple photometric structure .",
    "each one of them is considered as a triaxial distribution of one component luminous matter .",
    "thus , we ignore complications , such as dust , shells or disks etc . in this context",
    ", we mention that dust lanes or disks are sometimes used to constrain the orientations and shapes ( see , eg .",
    "tenjes et al .",
    "1993 , s94a ) .",
    "we also assume that the axes of each triaxial galaxy are intrinsically aligned , and therefore , the orientation as determined by using the observed data at a small @xmath7 and at a large @xmath8 gives the orientation of the entire galaxy .",
    "we shall examine this assumption in section 5 .",
    "determination of the intrinsic shape and the orientation using photometry is important because the number of galaxies with good photometry is many more than those with good kinematics .",
    "we find that photometry can constrain the orientation of the light distribution of the triaxial galaxies .",
    "we find that the position angle difference plays a key role in constraining the orientation .",
    "the most probable line of sight of a galaxy with very small @xmath25 lies close to one of the principle planes , although the estimates are not very much likelihood dominated . the orientation estimates are likelihood dominated and are well constrained for galaxies with large @xmath25 , typically around @xmath26 or more .",
    "the marginal posterior density is symmetrical in 4 pairs of octants in all cases of small and large @xmath25 ( these points are described in detail in sections 3 and 4 ) .",
    "section 2 presents the triaxial mass models .",
    "section 3 presents the orientations of ngc 7619 and two synthetic galaxies , which establish our methodology .",
    "section 4 discusses the orientations of a sample of galaxies . in section 5",
    ", we examine the alignment of the intrinsic principle axes of ngc 3379 , 4486 and 5638 . results and a discussion",
    "are presented in section 6 .",
    "we use models which are described in c08 .",
    "the models are triaxial generalizations of the spherical @xmath27-models @xmath28 of dehnen ( 1993 ) .",
    "these models have cusp at the centre and the cumulative mass converges .",
    "the projected surface density corresponding to @xmath29 most closely resembles to the de vaucouleurs @xmath30 law , and we concentrate to @xmath29 models only .",
    "however , it is realized that the shape and orientation estimates are not very sensitive to the radial profile of the projected density ( s94b ) .",
    "a triaxial generalization of dehnen s spherical density distribution @xmath31 is made triaxial by considering the distribution @xmath31 and replacing @xmath32 by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 . here",
    ", @xmath35 are the usual cartesian coordinates , @xmath32 is the spherical radial coordinate and @xmath36    the constant density surfaces are coaxial and coaligned ellipsoids with varying axial ratios @xmath37 , which are @xmath38 at small radii and are @xmath39 at large radii . in above , @xmath40 is the scale length and @xmath41 is a parameter .",
    "the parameter @xmath42 alters the values of @xmath37 in the intermediate region .",
    "these models are presented in chakraborty ( 2004 ) and are modified in c08 .",
    "we shall refer to these as @xmath43 models .",
    "another form of triaxial generalization of dehnen s model is presented in dezeeuw and carollo ( 1996 ) , and is modified in c08 . rewriting @xmath31 as @xmath44 ,",
    "the triaxial model is density distribution of the form @xmath45y^{0}_{2}+[h(r)+h_{1}(r)]y^{2}_{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the density in the usual spherical polar coordinates @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are two suitably chosen radial functions , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the usual spherical harmonics and @xmath52,\\\\ h_{1}=\\alpha \\frac{lr_{3}}{4\\pi ( r+r_{4})^{7}}[30rr_{4}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in above , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and the parameters @xmath53 are the same as in dezeeuw and carollo . @xmath54 and @xmath55 are introduced in c08 , which for choices of parameter @xmath56 , alter the profiles of @xmath57 and @xmath58 in the intermediate region .",
    "@xmath59 is the luminosity of the model .",
    "we shall refer to these as @xmath60 models .",
    "both the @xmath43 and the @xmath60 models form a family of four parameters models , and are fixed by a choice of axial ratios @xmath61 . the triaxialility @xmath62 and @xmath63 are related to the axial ratios at small and at large radii by @xmath64 for the @xmath60 models , and by @xmath65 for the @xmath43 models . to fix up the scale length @xmath40 of the triaxial models",
    ", we consider the value of effective radius @xmath66 of the spherical models .",
    "the effective radius of the triaxial models depends on the axial ratios , as well as on the viewing angles . however , such changes are small for @xmath27 models ( dezeeuw and carollo , 1996 ) and are neglected . for a choice of @xmath67 ,",
    "we take various values of @xmath42 and @xmath68 to calculate the probability .",
    "the unweighted sum of the probability using these ensemble of models gives a model independent estimate of the shape and orientation .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     a closer scruting of the plots of @xmath69 reveal that while plots of bin 1 and bin 2 are very close to each other , plot of bin 3 is slightly different : @xmath20 area of the probability of bin 3 is @xmath70 higher than that of bin 1 .",
    "we note that @xmath7 is very small and @xmath8 is very large for bin 1 and bin 2 .",
    "however , @xmath8 of bin 3 is not very large .",
    "the values of @xmath24 alongwith the area of @xmath19 highest probability of orientations of bins 1 , 2 , 3 are shown in table 5 . thus , the photometric data and the methodology are consistent with the idea that the intrinsic principle axes of ngc 5638 are aligned .",
    "probability @xmath69 of the orientation of bin 1 and bin 2 of ngc 4486 are presented in figures 10 and 19 .",
    "the location of the maximum probability of bin 1 and bin 2 are almost the same .",
    "the results are consistent with the assumption of alignment of the intrinsic principle axes of ngc 4486 .",
    "note that both galaxies ngc 5638 and 4486 , exhibit high values of @xmath25 and their orientations are well constrained .     for ngc 3379.,width=226 ]",
    "results of ngc 3379 are complex . the results of the locations of maximum probability and of the area of @xmath19 highest probability of bins ( 1 - 3 ) are shown in table 5 .",
    "we find that locations of maximum probability are not very close .",
    "further , the orientation estimate of bin 1 is not very much likelihood dominated : @xmath20 and @xmath21 regions occupy @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively",
    ".    orientation of ngc 3379 is not well constrained even when the kinematical data is included ( statler , 2001 , s94b ) .",
    "the probability distribution of ngc 3379 as a function of @xmath73 and the position angle @xmath74 of the projected y - axis of the body frame was presented in statler ( 2001 ) .",
    "kinematical and photometric data were used and it was shown that while @xmath73 is not well constrained , @xmath74 is constrained .",
    "we re - examine this by using photometric models only , and using the data as quoted in statler ( 2001 ) .",
    "the plot is presented in figure 20 , which can be compared with figure 5 ( top ) of statler ( 2001 ) .",
    "we find that the use of photometric data alone , worsens the situation . here , both @xmath73 and @xmath74 are not well constrained .",
    "we have demonstrated that the photometry can be used to obtain constraints on the orientations of the light distribution of elliptical galaxies , especially for the galaxies with large position angle difference .",
    "we have obtained the possible orientations of a few elliptical galaxies .",
    "we have also shown that the estimates are reliable by applying our methodology to the synthetic galaxies , wherein the orientations are known .",
    "we have found that the posterior probability density of the orientation estimate is symmetric in pairs of octants ( see , figure 2 and 12 , and the relevant text ) .",
    "this should be due to the mass models .",
    "the models are reflection symmetric about the principle planes .",
    "we have shown that the intrinsic principle axes of ngc 5638 and 4486 are aligned by applying the orientation estimates using photometry .",
    "however , conclusions regarding the alignment of axes of ngc 3379 are not rigorously established .",
    "this is basically due to the reason that the orientation estimates of ngc 3379 are not likelihood dominated .",
    "the marginal posterior density of orientation obtained by integrating over the shape parameters gives the possible orientation which reproduces the photometric data most closely for the greatest variety of shapes .",
    "likewise , the most probable shape obtained by marginalizing over the orientation reproduces the data over a greatest variety of orientations .",
    "these do not give simultaneous constraints of shape and orientation ( statler 2009 , private communication ) .",
