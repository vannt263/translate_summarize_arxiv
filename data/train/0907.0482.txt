    "the linear sigma model @xcite containing the pion field and a scalar field , sigma has played a very important role in particle physics during the last half century .",
    "originally , it helped to clarify the role of chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breakdown @xcite in strong interaction physics .",
    "the partial conservation of the axial currents together with their algebraic structure resulted in calculations for low energy pion physics which gave , for the first time , reasonable agreements with experiment . while the original calculations @xcite were roundabout , it was found that they could be greatly simplified by straightforward perturbative calculations in the non - linear version of the model obtained by assuming the sigma field to be very heavy .",
    "experimental evidence at that time did not clearly demand a light sigma meson .",
    "remarkably , the original linear version also turned out to be useful at a higher energy scale as the higgs potential @xcite of the electroweak standard model , with the sigma identified as the higgs field .",
    "more recently there has been some renewal of interest in the linear model for two different reasons .",
    "first , many people began to accept that a light sigma plays an important , but slightly hidden , role in low energy pion scattering .",
    "second , the idea of  walking technicolor \" theories @xcite has gained some popularity .",
    "these theories furnish interesting candidates for an _ effective _ higgs sector which has some similarity to the effective chiral lagrangians associated with the color qcd theory .",
    "such effective lagrangians usually include , in addition to spin 0 fields , spin 1 fields since",
    " vector meson dominance \" is a well established feature of low energy strong interactions .",
    "especially , the interplay of the composite technicolor vector and axial vector bosons appears to play an important role .",
    "our initial motivation is the further understanding of the properties of light scalar mesons .",
    "this is essentially connected with the s - wave pion pion scattering problem and also with the generalization to three light flavors of the underlying quarks .",
    "some characteristic papers in the recent revival of interest in this subject are @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a fascinating aspect is the possibility that the light scalars contain two quarks and two antiquarks rather than one quark and one antiquark @xcite .",
    "consideration of the surprisingly light masses of such a  four quark \" scalar nonet together with the surprisingly heavy candidates for a different , conventional  two quark \" nonet suggests @xcite a mixing between the two nonets . as discussed in section v of @xcite , it seems instructive to formulate this in a chiral invariant way using a generalized su(3 ) linear sigma model .",
    "this enables one to formally distinguish four quark vs two quark mesons by means of their differing axial u(1 ) transformations as well as to compare four quark contents of scalar and pseudoscalar states",
    ". other related work on mixing includes @xcite- @xcite .",
    "now in these generalized sigma models there are more than one scalar and the s - wave scattering is more complicated .",
    "at least qualitatively , the s- channel is dominated by these scalars . in the region near threshold ,",
    "the lowest mass sigma is most important .",
    "thus , as a start to studying the effects of the vector mesons in such models , it seems natural to go back to the original linear sigma model and add the vector meson , rho with its chiral partner .",
    "of course , this is not a new subject .",
    "a review of older work is given in @xcite and recent papers include those in @xcite .",
    "even though the plain linear sigma model is quite simple to deal with , the addition of spin 1 fields increases the overall complexity by an order of magnitude . in this paper the vector and axial vector fields",
    "are added as ( initially ) yang mills gauge fields .",
    "the local gauge symmetry is then manifestly broken by the addition of the three simplest chiral invariant spin 1 field mass terms .",
    "a somewhat new feature of the present work is that the determination of all lagrangian parameters is carried out analytically with respect to the experimental inputs .",
    "the s - wave pion scattering is studied both for the threshold region and for the region away from threshold which is expected to be influenced by the presence of the lightest sigma .",
    "the scattering is explicitly compared with that of the plain linear sigma model as well as with experiment .    because we have a simple connection between the lagrangian parameters and the physical inputs , it is straightforward for us to also discuss application of the model to the non - qcd , but presumably chiral , situation which describes the walking technicolor theories . in particular",
    ", the case @xcite where the vector meson is heavier than the axial vector meson will be treated in detail .    in section",
    "ii , we expand the model lagrangian in terms of the component fields representing the scalar @xmath0 , the pseudoscalar , @xmath1 the vector @xmath2 and the axial vector , @xmath3 .",
    "section iii first discusses the diagonalization necessitated by the @xmath4 term in the lagrangian .",
    "this results in  physical \" pion and axial vector fields denoted with tildes . in general , the tilde will also be used on other objects to denote the fact that they are  physical \" .",
    "especially , in this section , the crucial job of determining the parameters of the lagrangian from experiment will be discussed in detail . in section",
    "iv the complicated formula for the invariant mandelstam amplitude in pion - pion scattering is computed at tree level .",
    "the s - wave partial wave amplitudes with i=0 and i=2 are then given explicitly .",
    "section v discusses these amplitudes near threshold and also briefly explains their unitarizations by the k - matrix method . in section",
    "vi , the behaviors of the s - wave amplitudes away from threshold are treated .",
    "section vii discusses some connections of this model with some interesting other work ; first the limit of the present model in which the weinberg @xcite and kawarabayashi suzuki riazuddin fayazuddin ( ksrf ) @xcite relations both hold is discussed .",
    "in addition , a systematic treatment of the model is given for the case in which ( going beyond the application to low energy qcd ) the vector meson mass is greater than the axial vector meson mass .",
    "section viii provides additional discussion . in the appendix ,",
    "it is explicitly shown how the scattering amplitude reproduces the  current algebra \" result of the chiral model without spin 1 fields in the limit where the sigma mass goes to infinity .",
    "here , we present the version of the @xmath5 gauged linear sigma model lagrangian to be studied .",
    "the basic fields are the scalar , @xmath0 and pion , @xmath6 , which are contained in @xmath7 and its hermitian conjugate .",
    "the starting piece is the kinetic term for @xmath8 , which is invariant under the chiral transformation , @xmath9 .",
    "one can naturally introduce the left ( @xmath10 ) and the right ( @xmath11 ) vector fields by gauging the chiral symmetry .",
    "the resulting gauge invariant lagrangian density is then ,    @xmath12    where the covariant derivatives of @xmath8 and @xmath13 are ,    @xmath14    and the field strength tensors take the form ,    @xmath15 ,   \\nonumber \\\\ f_{\\mu\\nu}^r & = & \\partial_\\mu r_\\nu-\\partial_\\nu r_\\mu - ig[r_\\mu , r_\\nu].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the vector and axial vector mesons are defined as @xmath16    the terms which contribute to particle masses are :    @xmath17    the first , @xmath18 term , which breaks the gauge invariance ( and also the formal scale symmetry ) , gives the same mass to the vector and the axial vector mesons .",
    "the c term also gives the same mass to both spin 1 mesons , but maintains the scale symmetry .",
    "the b term breaks the mass degeneracy of the two spin 1 mesons .",
    "this is important since , experimentally , the lightest isovector , axial vector meson with negative g - parity ( the @xmath19(1260 ) is heavier than the rho meson .",
    "another contribution to this mass splitting arises from spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the model , but this effect by itself will be seen to be insufficient .",
    "the last two terms are the scalar potential terms which respectively yield the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and the explicit symmetry breaking due to the small quark mass ; explicitly ,    @xmath20    here , @xmath21 is positive while @xmath19 is chosen to be negative so that spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking will give a nontrivial vacuum expectation value @xmath22 for @xmath0 .",
    "the explicit symmetry breaking term @xmath23 mocks up the light quark mass terms .",
    "the coefficients in this potential can be determined by the minimum condition in terms of the sigma and pion mass parameters , with the definition @xmath24 , as follows :    @xmath25    from this , one can easily derive the coefficients ,    @xmath26    the potential terms can be expressed in terms of the fields as :    @xmath27    here , quadrilinear terms involving @xmath0 have not been written .",
    "also note that the quantities @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are not the physical ones , which will be defined later .",

    "we have no experimentally a priori way of specifying the physical parameters and the bound .",
    "nevertheless , we observe that @xmath79 would be exceptionally large for a reasonable solution .    in fig.[vplot9 ] , which corresponds to the choice of the minus sign in eq.([chig ] ) , it is seen that the qcd case ( lower curve ) has no consistent parameter solution since @xmath79 = 8.56 can not be achieved for @xmath154 . on the other hand , the upper curve , which corresponds again to @xmath153 = 1.2 , gives reasonable values of @xmath79 .    to summarize : the qcd case corresponds to the plus sign choice in eq.([chig ] ) while a possible consistent parameter solution in a non - qcd setting with @xmath155 is likely to correspond to the minus sign choice .",
    "it is amusing to observe that the relation between the vacuum value @xmath22 and @xmath77 differs for the two sign choices : @xmath156 to see this note that for the plus sign case , eq.([chig ] ) gives @xmath157 which , using eq.([w2 ] ) translates to @xmath158 and the desired result when eq.([renor2 ] ) is noted . the minus sign case is obtained similarly after first noting @xmath159 in that situation .",
    "= 7.5 cm     = 7.5 cm     we have seen that the choice of sign in eq.([chig ] ) distinguishes the two cases where @xmath78 is less than or greater than @xmath75 .",
    "this choice occurs in fitting the parameters to experiment .",
    "it may be of some interest to ask how this distinction is related to the parameters of the effective lagrangian directly . to investigate this ,",
    "we just subtract the second of eqs.([spinonemass ] ) from the first : @xmath160 in the qcd case , table [ params ] shows that @xmath106 is negative and that the right hand side above is negative because @xmath161 . in the case which should correspond to a walking technicolor theory we evidently must require ,",
    "if @xmath106 is also negative , the opposite condition @xmath162 .",
    "that condition seems intuitively plausible .",
    "since @xmath106 is the coefficient of a scale invariant term in the effective lagrangian , we might expect it not to change sign in going from one theory to the other .",
    "furthermore , we would expect the phenomenological coupling constant @xmath36 to behave something like the underlying gauge theory coupling constant and hence to decrease in strength for a  walking \" theory @xcite .",
    "first , we argued that a detailed treatment of the gauged minimal linear sigma model would be very helpful for developing a better understanding of the light scalar mesons in qcd .",
    "one quickly realizes , however , that such a model is much more complicated than the ungauged version .",
    "hence , attention was first paid to developing an  analytic procedure \" for relating the lagrangian parameters to the four well established experimental inputs : @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 $ ] . the key equation obtained is eq.([2signs ] ) or equivalently , eq.([chig ] ) .",
    "if the minus sign in this equation is chosen , it was shown ( in the last section ) that there is no consistent solution of parameters when inputs are taken from the possible application to qcd of this model .",
    "on the other hand , the minus sign choice allows a solution with @xmath155 , which is plausibly related to a  minimal walking technicolor \" application of the effective lagrangian .",
    "if the plus sign choice is made in this equation , it was shown that the qcd application of the model is allowed though a  walking technicolor \" application , while possible , seems to correspond to an extremely large rho boson width .",
    "there is also a special case in this equation when the square root vanishes so the sign choice is irrelevant .",
    "in that situation , the weinberg and ksrf relations are both satisfied in the unphysical limit where b=0 .    in this work",
    "we did not impose either the weinberg or ksrf relations .",
    "the model is self - contained and represents a spontaneously broken chiral su(2 ) symmetry with an assumed particle spectrum of pi , sigma , rho and @xmath80 .    as a check , before comparing the computed s wave pion pion scattering to experiment , we verified ( in the appendix ) that the complicated formula for the amplitude reduces to that of the non - linear sigma model without vectors when the sigma mass goes to infinity .    to begin the study of the scattering amplitude in the resonant s - wave channel we fit the near threshold na48/2 data @xcite up to about 370 mev using the tree amplitude .",
    "a good fit was obtained by choosing the bare sigma mass , @xmath91 to be about 420 mev . a similarly good fit in the sigma model without spin 1 fields needed @xmath91 to be about 620 mev instead ( see fig .",
    "[ vplot3 ] ) .",
    "once a value of @xmath91 is chosen , the amplitude is also predicted at higher energies .",
    "it was pointed out ( see fig .",
    "[ vplot4 ] that those values of @xmath91 resulted in ",
    "global \" pictures of the s - wave scattering which was considerably distorted .",
    "much better  global \" pictures emerge from choices of bare sigma mass , @xmath91 about 850 mev .",
    "however such a value for @xmath91 results in , as seen in fig .",
    "[ vplot10 ] , some loss of precision for the region just near threshold . from the standpoint of learning about the sigma ,",
    "the higher bare sigma mass is evidently the more suitable one .",
    "the feature of getting similar fits with or without vectors , but with different values of the sigma parameters which emerged in the discussions in sections v and vi had been already observed some time ago @xcite . in that case , the non - linear 3-flavor chiral lagrangian was used instead and the region from threshold to about 1.2 gev was fit . rather than the k - matrix method , a phenomenological unitarization scheme was employed .",
    "it seems that the light sigma and the @xmath165 are , not surprisingly , the main features of the i=0 , s - wave pion - pion scattering amplitude in this energy range . adding the rho meson changes somewhat the parameters of the sigma needed for fitting .",
    "comparing the  global \" fits to the resonant s - wave pion pion scattering amplitude up to about 800 mev , it is seen that the linear sigma model without the spin 1 particles actually gives a better fit than the one with the spin 1 particles included .",
    "this seems to be due to the higher polynomial terms induced by the yang mills interaction .",
    "if one takes the present model at face value , the underlying lagrangian appears to describe all the contained particles as quark anti - quark composites .",
    "in the mixing picture mentioned earlier @xcite- @xcite , where all the particles are mixtures of these  2 quark \" states with  4 quark \" states , this work should be modified to include two different chiral multiplets and the 2-flavor case upgraded to the 3 flavor case for more realism .",
    "this has been done for the case without vectors and axial vectors in the mentioned references so adding the spin 1 particles in that framework is a next step .",
    "we would expect that the general behaviors of the lowest lying sigma and the rho and @xmath80 would be similar to those in the present model .    also in the application to the minimal walking technicolor model @xcite",
    ", the present piece would have to be embedded in a larger framework with an initial su(4 ) symmetry .",
    "one might similarly expect that the behaviors of the sigma ( = higgs ) and the technicolor spin 1 bosons would be similar to those seen here @xcite .",
