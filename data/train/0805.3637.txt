    "a meaningful communication requires a common frame of reference between the sender and the receiver . depending on the nature of transmitted information ,",
    "different types of references are needed e.g. a common time reference , phase reference , direction reference , cartesian frame of reference etc . establishing a common frame",
    "can be achieved by sending a physical system prepared in a proper state e.g. a clock , a gyroscope , which allows two parties for aligning , and calibrating their devices accordingly .",
    "the quality of the alignment depends on the quality in which the relevant information is encoded and decoded from the physical system . roughly speaking ,",
    "the higher is the relevant signal to noise ratio in the system the better is the alignment .",
    "when looking for fundamental limitations on the precision of alignment , quantum mechanics provides ultimate bounds on the signal to noise ratio arising from unavoidable uncertainty inherent in any quantum measurement .",
    "the problem of optimal alignment is thus the following : under given physically motivated restrictions , e.g. finite number of particles , limited energy , etc .",
    "find the state and the measurement that yield alignment with the highest accuracy possible .",
    "mathematically the problem may be formulated as follows .",
    "consider a quantum system ( in particular the system may consist of many copies of smaller subsystems ) and let @xmath2 be a quantum state prepared by one of the parties . after being sent to the second party , which uses a different reference frame ,",
    "the evolution of the state may be described by a unitary representation @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is an element of a group describing possible transformation of reference frames , e.g. @xmath5 ( phase ) , @xmath6 ( direction ) , @xmath7 ( cartesian frame ) .",
    "the transmitted state @xmath8 is subsequently measured be the second party in order to establish the relation between its own reference frame and that of the first party .",
    "the measurement is described by a set of positive operators @xmath9 , @xmath10 . depending on the result obtained , a guess @xmath11 ( the estimator function ) is made concerning the true value @xmath12 of the group element responsible for the transformation of the state .",
    "finally a cost function @xmath13 should be defined penalizing for inaccurate estimation of @xmath12 .",
    "the problem is solved once the state and the measurement is found minimizing the average value of the cost function ( for a review see e.g. @xcite ) . from a physical point of view",
    "any reasonable cost function should be both left invariant : @xmath14 which makes this function sensitive only to relative transformation of the state , and right invariant @xmath15 which can be seen as independence from background reference frame transformations .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that such a cost function can always be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 are arbitrary coefficients and @xmath18 are characters of the group @xmath19 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the majorana representation of state presented in tab .",
    "[ tab : optimalstates ] are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : majorana ] .",
    "we do not claim to present all classes of optimal state for reference frame alignment and it seems from numerical calculations that they are infinitely many of them .",
    "this is completely different from direction reference alignment case where @xmath20 is the only optimal state .        for odd @xmath0 analogous states",
    "perform optimally , e.g. in _ cube _ , _ icosahedron _ , _ dodecahedron _ classes one only needs to replace @xmath21 state with @xmath22 or @xmath23 state and adjust weights to make the covariance matrix diagonal with @xmath24 .",
    "we should also mention that for and only for @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 there are no pure states yielding a diagonal covariance matrix with @xmath24 . in these cases the optimal states have to be found by directly maximizing the sum of inverse eigenvalues of the fisher information matrix , which can be easily done numerically .",
    "in this paper we have found the optimal states for aligning cartesian reference frames in the approach where deviations from perfect alignment are small .",
    "using cramr - rao bound we have shown that the problem simplifies to the search for @xmath0 qubit states with diagonal spin covariance matrix with maximal possible variances of all three spin components @xmath29 .",
    "we have used the majorana representation where platonic solids correspond to the optimal states , and proposed classes of states optimal for arbitrary high number of qubits @xmath0 . as a byproduct",
    "we have also proven that distinguishability of qubits is useless for cartesian reference frame alignment in the local approach .",
