    "<S> applying the theory of yang - lee zeros to nonequilibrium critical phenomena , we investigate the properties of a directed bond percolation process for a complex percolation parameter @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that for the golden ratio @xmath1 and for @xmath2 the survival probability of a cluster can be computed exactly .    </S>",
    "<S> directed percolation ( dp ) is an anisotropic variant of ordinary percolation in which activity can only percolate along a given direction in space . regarding this direction as a temporal degree of freedom </S>",
    "<S> , dp can be interpreted as a dynamical process . directed percolation represents one of the most prominent universality classes of nonequilibrium phase transitions from a fluctuating active phase into a non - fluctuating absorbing state  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a simple realization of dp is directed bond percolation . in this model </S>",
    "<S> the bonds of a tilted square lattice are conducting with probability @xmath0 and non - conducting with probability @xmath3 ( see figure  [ figbonddp ] ) . the order parameter which characterizes the phase transition is the probability @xmath4 that a randomly chosen site belongs to an infinite cluster . </S>",
    "<S> a cluster consists of all sites that are connected by a directed path of conducting bonds to the sites that generate the cluster at time @xmath5 . for @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> this probability is finite whereas it vanishes for @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> close to the phase transition @xmath4 is known to vanish algebraically as @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> although dp can be defined and simulated easily , it is one of the very few systems for which  even in one spatial dimension  no analytical solution is known , suggesting that dp is a non - integrable process . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the values of the percolation threshold and the critical exponents are not simple numerical fractions but seem to be irrational instead . </S>",
    "<S> currently the best estimates for directed bond percolation in 1 + 1 dimensions are @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite .    in recent years a large variety of _ equilibrium _ phase transitions have been analyzed by studying the distribution of yang - lee zeros @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> the partition sum of a finite equilibrium system is expressed as a polynomial of the control parameter ( usually a function of temperature ) . </S>",
    "<S> typically the zeros of this polynomial lie on simpler geometric manifolds such as circles in the complex plane . </S>",
    "<S> as the system size increases these zeros approach the real axes at the phase transition point . </S>",
    "<S> this explains the crossover to a non - analytic behaviour at the transition in the limit of an infinite system . </S>",
    "<S> even more recently , the concept of yang and lee has been generalized to integrable nonequilibrium systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the present work is motivated by an ongoing effort to apply similar techniques to non - integrable systems such as directed percolation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our aim is to understand the nature of _ nonequilibrium _ phase transitions in more detail and to search for a signature of integrability and non - integrability in the distribution of yang - lee zeros .    </S>",
    "<S> to apply the concept of yang - lee zeros to dp , we consider the order parameter in a finite system as a function of the percolation probability @xmath0 in the complex plane . </S>",
    "<S> this can be done by studying the _ survival probability _ @xmath11 , which is defined as the probability that a cluster generated in a single site at time @xmath5 survives up to time @xmath12 ( or even longer ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that in the limit of infinite @xmath12 the order parameter @xmath4 and @xmath11 coincide . </S>",
    "<S> the partition sum of an equilibrium system and the survival probability of dp show a similar behaviour in many respects , e.g. they both are positive in the physically accessible regime and can be expressed as polynomials in finite systems . </S>",
    "<S> if the system size tends to infinity , both functions exhibit a non - analytic behavior at the phase transition as the yang - lee zeros in the complex plane approach the real line .    in directed bond percolation </S>",
    "<S> the survival probability is given by the sum over the weights of all possible configurations of bonds . </S>",
    "<S> each conducting bond contributes to the weight with a factor @xmath0 , while each non - conducting bond contributes with a factor @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the states of those bonds which do not touch the actual cluster are irrelevant as they do not contribute to the survival of the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is sufficient to consider the sum over all possible _ clusters _ @xmath13 of bonds connected to the origin . </S>",
    "<S> each cluster is weighted by the contributions of the conducting bonds belonging to the cluster and the non - conducting bonds belonging to its hull . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , the survival probability can be expressed as @xmath14 where the sum runs over all clusters reaching the horizontal row at time @xmath12 . for each cluster @xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> denotes the number of its bonds , while @xmath16 is the number of bonds belonging to its hull ( see left part of figure  [ figcluster ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath16 does not include bonds connecting sites at time @xmath12 and @xmath17 since the cluster may survive even longer . summing up all weights in equation  ( [ survivalprobability ] ) , </S>",
    "<S> one obtains a polynomial of degree @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> as can be verified , the first few polynomials are given by    @xmath19    as @xmath12 increases , the number of cluster configurations grows rapidly , leading to complicated polynomials with very large coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of zeros in the complex plane for the polynomial @xmath20 is shown in figure  [ figyanglee ] . as can be seen </S>",
    "<S> , the distribution reminds of a fractal , being perhaps a signature of the non - integrable nature of dp . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the zeros approach the phase transition point from above and below .    </S>",
    "<S> while a statistical analysis of the distribution of zeros will be presented elsewhere , we will focus in the present work on a particularly surprising observation . </S>",
    "<S> this is the existence of certain points on the real line where the polynomials can be solved exactly for all values of @xmath12 . beside the trivial points @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 ) , we find a @xmath12-independent zero at @xmath2 and , even more surprisingly , a very simple solution if @xmath0 is equal to one of the golden ratios @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the golden ratios are the roots of the quadratic equation @xmath26 and play an important role not only in number theory  @xcite but also in other fields ranging from chaotic systems  @xcite to arts  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although these special points are located outside the physically accessible regime @xmath27 , their existence may help to understand the structure of yang - lee zeros in the complex plane .    </S>",
    "<S> * time - independent zero at @xmath2 : * + for @xmath2 and @xmath28 all polynomials @xmath11 vanish identically . </S>",
    "<S> this can be shown as follows . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the probability @xmath29 that a cluster dies out at time @xmath12 , i.e. , the row at time @xmath12 is the last row reached by a cluster . </S>",
    "<S> obviously @xmath29 is related to the survival probability by @xmath30 clearly , @xmath29 can be expressed as a weighted sum over the same set of clusters as in  ( [ survivalprobability ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the present case the weights differ from those in equation  ( [ survivalprobability ] ) by the number of non - conducting bonds in the clusters hull between @xmath12 and @xmath17 since it is now required that all sites at time t+1 are inactive ( see right part of figure  [ figcluster ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this means that @xmath29 can be expressed as @xmath31 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath32 have the same meaning as in  ( [ survivalprobability ] ) and @xmath33 is the number of active sites in the horizontal row at time @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , for @xmath2 the additional factor @xmath34 drops out so that @xmath35 for all values of @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath36 ( for @xmath2 ) . combining these results with equation  ( [ rdef ] ) we arrive at @xmath37 for @xmath38 , which completes the proof .    </S>",
    "<S> * exact solution for @xmath0 at the golden ratio : * + for @xmath39 we find that the survival probability ` oscillates ' between two different values , namely @xmath40    to prove this result , we first verify that  ( [ mainresult ] ) is indeed satisfied for @xmath5 and @xmath41 . then we show that @xmath42 however , instead of analyzing the survival probability directly , it turns out to be more convenient to consider the complementary probability @xmath43 that a cluster does _ not _ survive until time @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , @xmath44 is the sum over the weights of all clusters which do not reach the horizontal row at time @xmath12 , i.e. , we impose the boundary condition @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the states of the two sites @xmath46 and @xmath47 at the left edge of the clusters , this set of clusters may be separated into three different subsets , namely , + * ( a ) * a subset where @xmath48 ,    * ( b ) * a subset where @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and    * ( c ) * a subset where @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> + next we show that the weights of the clusters in the subsets ( a ) and ( b ) cancel each other . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we note that the weighted sum @xmath52 over all clusters in both subsets may be decomposed into two independent factors @xmath53 , where @xmath54 depends only on the state of the three bonds between the sites @xmath47 , @xmath46 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 ( inside the box in figure  [ figproof ] ) , while @xmath57 accounts for all other relevant bonds . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the first factor is given by @xmath58 while @xmath57 takes the same value in both subsets . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if @xmath0 is given by the golden ratio , we obtain @xmath59 and therefore the weights of subsets ( a ) and ( b ) cancel . consequently , all remaining contributions to @xmath44 come from the clusters in subset ( c ) where the sites @xmath46 and @xmath47 are inactive .    </S>",
    "<S> now we can iterate this procedure by successively considering the sites @xmath60 and @xmath61 from the left to the right , where @xmath62 . in this way it can be shown that all these sites have to be inactive as well . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the only surviving contributions are those in which the entire row of sites at @xmath63 is inactive , implying that @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> the proof of equation  ( [ mainresult ] ) then follows by induction .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the survival probability @xmath11 of a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional directed bond percolation process can be computed exactly at certain points on the physically non - accessible part of the real axes . </S>",
    "<S> we hope that this observation may help to understand the distribution of yang - lee zeros in the complex plane . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we expect similar special points to exist in other realizations of dp and related models . </S>",
