    "the _ xmm - newton _ optical monitor ( xmm - om ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is a 30  cm ritchey chrtien telescope working at ultraviolet and optical wavelengths .",
    "it is co - aligned with the x - ray mirrors on the european space agency s _ xmm - newton _ observatory . a similar instrument , the ultraviolet / optical telescope ( uvot ; * ?",
    "* ) is carried on nasa s _ swift _ gamma - ray - burst observatory .",
    "the xmm - om detector is a micro - channel plate ( mcp ) intensified charge coupled device ( ccd ) ( mic ; * ? ? ?",
    "incoming photons first encounter a multi - alkali s20 photo - cathode , where they are converted into one or two electrons which are then proximity focused onto a series of mcps .",
    "the mcps multiply the number of incoming electrons by a factor of @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting electron cloud then encounters a phosphor screen , which converts the signal back into photons",
    ". a tapered block of optical fibres then transmits the photons to a frame - transfer ccd with a science area of 256  @xmath2  256 pixels . a single photon incident on the photo - cathode results in a large splash of photons over several pixels of the ccd .",
    "photon splashes are detected in individual ccd frames and centroided by the onboard electronics to a precision of one eighth of a ccd pixel , equivalent to 0.5 arcsec on the sky .",
    "when two or more incident photons give rise to overlapping photon splashes on the ccd during a single ccd frame , they are recorded as a single incident photon .",
    "this phenomenon is known as coincidence loss @xcite .",
    "when the arrival rate of photons from an astronomical source is small compared to the frame rate of the ccd , coincidence loss is unimportant and the response of the instrument is linear .",
    "coincidence loss leads to an increasingly non - linear response from the detector as the incident photon rate approaches the frame rate of the ccd . for xmm - om ,",
    "the non - linearity is calibrated , and photometry can be corrected in ground processing for incident photon rates up to 3.6 times the ccd frame rate .",
    "photometric uncertainty becomes large as this limit is approached @xcite . beyond this limit ,",
    "the detected photon rate saturates at approximately the frame rate of the ccd and photometry is not recoverable via the usual aperture photometry method .",
    "one way to overcome this limitation to the dynamic range of the instrument is to use the photons that arrive during the frame transfer of the ccd . at the end of each ccd frame ,",
    "the ccd image is shifted to the frame store area for read out .",
    "photons that arrive during the frame transfer ( i.e. while the image is being moved downwards towards the frame store ) are displaced in the vertical direction .",
    "bright sources therefore show vertical streaks of displaced photons which we will refer to hereafter as read - out streaks .",
    "the frame transfer is sufficiently fast that coincidence - loss is greatly reduced in the read - out streak compared to the direct image .",
    "@xcite showed that the read - out streaks in _ swift _ uvot images can be used for photometric measurements , and demonstrated a photometric precision of 0.1 mag .",
    "they found that the bright limit for uvot photometry could be decreased by 2.4 magnitudes for full - frame images using this method , with coincidence - loss within the mcps rather than the ccd dictating the bright limit for read - out - streak photometry .",
    "in this paper we test and calibrate read - out - streak photometry for the xmm - om , before applying the method to construct a catalogue of photometry for bright sources observed with xmm - om . in section  [ sec : instrument ] we describe the basic principles of photometry using read - out streaks . in section  [ sec : method ] we describe the data and methods used to calibrate the recharge time of the mcps and verify read - out streak photometry against sources of known brightness .",
    "the results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] . in section  [ sec : rrtel ] we demonstrate the technique by deriving xmm - om uvw1 photometry for the symbiotic nova rr telescopii and examining its long term photometric evolution . in section  [ sec : suppcat ] we describe the construction of a catalogue containing photometry of sources which exceed the brightness limit of the xmm - suss  2.1 catalogue .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .    unless otherwise stated",
    ", magnitudes are given in the vega system .",
    "the xmm - om and _ swift _ uvot detectors were built to identical specifications , so the principles of read - out streak photometry are much the same in the two instruments and the description in section 2 of @xcite is valid for xmm - om as well . however , the two instruments are operated rather differently . whereas uvot has only three hardware - window modes and three corresponding frame times",
    ", xmm - om routinely uses a variety of hardware windows to image different parts of the field of view ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : streakdiagram ] for an example ) , and so a variety of frame times .",
    "the mathematical description that follows therefore differs from that given in @xcite in that it is valid for any frame time , rather than for specific values .        during frame transfer ,",
    "charge is shifted 290 rows downwards from the imaging portion of the ccd to the frame store area at a rate of 1 row per @xmath3  s , for a total transfer time of @xmath4  s. photons arriving during this frame - transfer time form the read - out streak .",
    "following @xcite , we base our read - out streak photometry on a measurement in a @xmath5 unbinned image pixel aperture , which corresponds to @xmath6 ccd pixels , and therefore an effective exposure time corresponding to the transfer time of 2 ccd rows , @xmath7  s. for a frame time @xmath8 , in which an image is accumulated and then transferred , the ratio @xmath9 of the exposure time in the static image to the read - out streak is therefore @xmath10    the zeropoints for read - out streak photometry are related to the normal imaging zeropoints by the ratio of equivalent exposure time @xmath9 , such that @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the zeropoint for read - out - streak photometry and @xmath13 is the imaging zeropoint .",
    "a complication arises in that imaging zeropoints for xmm - om , given in the current calibration file ( ccf ) are given for 6 or 17.5 arcsec radius apertures , depending on filter @xcite , which have somewhat larger footprints than the @xmath14 aperture used for the read - out streak photometry .",
    "therefore we have converted the published zeropointscolourtrans@xmath150010.ccf ] to those which would be appropriate for a 5 arcsecond radius aperture using the encircled energy fractionspsf1drb@xmath150010.ccf ] for low - count - rate sources in the ccf to match better the read - out - streak aperture , and to maintain consistency with the approach in @xcite .",
    "as the ccf does not contain a suitable encircled energy fraction calibration for the white filter , we have used the encircled energy fraction for the @xmath16 filter for this purpose .",
    "the adjusted imaging zeropoints , appropriate for use as @xmath13 in equation  [ eq : zeropoints ] are given in table [ tab : zeropoints ] .",
    ".xmm - om imaging vega and ab zeropoints scaled to a 5 arcsec radius aperture , suitable for use as @xmath13 in equation  [ eq : zeropoints ] .",
    "for the white filter we do not provide an ab zeropoint because the ccf does not contain an ab zeropoint for this filter . [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]      the supplementary catalogue is available as a fits file via the mssl xmm - suss2 web pages1/ ] and will be available from the esa _ xmm - newton _ science archive ( xsa ) .",
    "we have shown that read - out streaks in xmm - om images can be used for photometric measurements of stars that are brighter than the coincidence - loss limit for normal aperture photometry .",
    "the study is based on xmm - om @xmath17- and @xmath18-band measurements of stars in the tycho-2 catalogue .",
    "we find that the recharge timescale for the pores of the microchannel plates in xmm - om is 5.5@xmath19 @xmath20  s , which sets the bright - source limit for read - out streak photometry to be 1.5 magnitudes brighter than the limit imposed by coincidence - loss in the ccd in full - frame images .",
    "we find that systematics and unaccounted errors limit the precision of the read - out streak photometry to 0.1 mag . as a demonstration",
    ", we have derived uvw1 photometry of the symbiotic nova rr tel using read - out streaks , and compared it to photometry derived from earlier iue observations .",
    "we have used the read - out streak method to construct a supplementary catalogue of photometry for sources which were too bright for photometric measurement in the xmm - suss2.1 catalogue . using this method ,",
    "photometry is recovered for 50 per cent of the uv measurements which exceeded the xmm - suss2.1 bright limit .",
