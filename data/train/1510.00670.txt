    "the parametric phase - locked oscillator is known to possess a wide - ranging set of applications in both the fundamental and the applied sciences . in recent years",
    ", this device has become a significant part in the experimental implementation of basic quantum optical systems and they are also envisaged to be a core component of quantum computers @xcite .",
    "one of the standard system displaying phase - locking behavior is the optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) which has been shown to be an efficient source of squeezed light @xcite .",
    "the subharmonic oscillatory mode of opo excited through the degenerate down - conversion process is found to exhibit two phase stability .",
    "this indicates the presence of two stable states in the optical mode above the generation threshold , with the two states having equal photon number but different phases @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the wigner function of the subharmonic mode acquires a two - fold symmetry in phase space .",
    "such phase - locking behavior can also be realized in the nondegenerate ( double resonant ) optical parametric oscillator ( nopo ) by including additional intracavity quarter - waveplate to provide polarization mixing between two orthogonally polarized modes of the subharmonics @xcite .",
    "a full quantum mechanical treatment of this system has been presented in @xcite on the generation of continuous - variable entangled states of light beams under mode phase locked condition , while experimental realizations have been achieved in @xcite .",
    "the experimental observation of dynamical signatures of self - phase - locking phenomenon in a triply resonant degenerate opo was reported in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the cascaded phase - locked oscillators for the production of three - photon states were proposed in @xcite .",
    "phase - locking transition was also observed in a chirped superconducting josephson resonator @xcite .",
    "more recently , the josephson parametric phase - locked oscillator was demonstrated , and it was applied to detect binary signals with the identified digital information stored in the form of two oscillatory distinct phases @xcite .",
    "this enables the accurate measurement of the state of superconducting qubit without affecting the integrity of the stored information .",
    "another important implementation that exploits the phase - locking mechanism is the combination of opo with the intracavity kerr nonlinear element , the so - called parametrically driven nonlinear resonator ( pdnr ) @xcite .",
    "this system was first proposed as an optical parametric oscillator in the pulsed regime with the incorporation of an intracavity third - order nonlinear element leading to kerr - interaction @xcite .",
    "a complete quantum treatment of phase - locked pdnr has been developed in terms of the fokker - planck equation in complex p - representation @xcite .",
    "the quantum regime of pdnr requires a comparatively high level of third - order kerr nonlinearity with respect to dissipation . in this regime",
    ", the pulsed pdnr has been proposed for the production of quantum superposition states and two - photon fock states @xcite .",
    "up till now , the phenomenon of phase - locking has been examined mainly from the mean - field approach which is fully justifiable in the case of relatively high photon number of cavity modes as well as for the regular operational regimes of parametric devices , for instance via the use of continuous - wave or pulsed driving fields . in this paper",
    ", we shall investigate into phase - locking at a low - level of excitation numbers of cavity mode ; in the strong quantum regime ; and in complete consideration of dissipation and decoherence .",
    "moreover , we shall analyse into phase - locking within the chaotic regime of pdnr .",
    "in other words , we study into properties of dissipative chaos for oscillatory open systems which display phase - locking behavior .",
    "the most successful approach of probing quantum dissipative chaos is based on quantum tomographic methods , which involve measurements of wigner function in phase space . in consequence",
    ", quantum chaos can be detected through a comparison between the contour plots of the wigner functions and the strange attractors that characterize dissipative chaos in classical poincar section @xcite .",
    "note that such analysis seems to be rather qualitative than quantitative for strong quantum regime and for the range of low - level oscillatory excitation numbers , where the validity of semiclassical equation is questionable .",
    "thus , in this paper we provide only quantum analysis of chaos based on the wigner functions without any analysis from the semiclassical approach .",
    "note that alternative approaches of probing quantum dissipative chaos involve consideration of entropic characteristics ; analysis of statistics of excitation number @xcite ; and application of methods based on fidelity decay @xcite , kullback - leibler quantum divergence @xcite , and the purity of quantum states @xcite .",
    "our paper is arranged as follow . in sec .",
    "ii , we provide a brief description of pdnr driven by a train of gaussian pulses . in sec .",
    "iii , we study the phase - locking phenomena at a low - level of excitation number for both the regular and chaotic regimes of the pdnr . finally , we summarize our results in sec .",
    "we consider a composite nonlinear one - mode resonator involving second - order and third - order kerr nonlinearities excited by a train of pulses .",
    "the system is thus a parametrically driven kerr resonator with the following hamiltonian : @xmath0 here , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the oscillatory creation and annihilation operators , @xmath3 is the oscillatory frequency , @xmath4 is the mean frequency of the driving field , and @xmath5 is the strength of the nonlinearity which is proportional to the third - order susceptibility for the case of kerr - media .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath6 is proportional to the second - order susceptibility and the time - dependent amplitude of the driving field .",
    "it consists of gaussian pulses with duration @xmath7 separated by time interval @xmath8 as follow : @xmath9 note that @xmath10 is responsible for the linear loss of the oscillatory mode due to coupling to a heat reservoir which gives rise to a damping rate of @xmath11 .",
    "we consider our system to be in the regime of strong kerr nonlinearities with respect to dissipation , i.e. @xmath23 .",
    "recent progress in circuit qed , superconducting systems and solid - state artificial atoms has opened up new avenues for the design of device configurations based on our model . in particular , the hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) with @xmath24 , describes a josephson junction embedded in a transmission - line resonator with the effect of the quadratic part of the josephson potential being taken into account exactly . in this case",
    ", the raising ( @xmath1 ) and lowering ( @xmath2 ) operators describe the normal mode of the resonator plus junction circuit .",
    "the nonlinearity is found to lead to self - kerr effects . by replacing the single junction with a squid",
    ", the kerr coefficient then allows the parametric term to describe a degenerate two - photon excitation by microwave light @xcite .",
    "we solve the master equation given by eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) numerically based on the method of quantum state diffusion ( qsd ) @xcite .",
    "the application of this technique to the studies of driven nonlinear oscillators and opos can be gleaned from the refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the semiclassical approach ,",
    "the corresponding equation of motion for the dimensionless amplitude of oscillatory mode takes the following form : @xmath25\\alpha + if(t)\\omega\\alpha^ { * } -\\gamma\\alpha . \\label{semclass}\\ ] ] this equation modifies the standard equation for parametric oscillator with kerr nonlinearity for the case of pulsed excitation .    to proceed with further analysis we shall present at first the semiclassical steady - state solutions and stability properties of pdnr for the monochromatic excitation , @xmath24 @xcite . in the standard analysis the amplitude of the oscillatory mode",
    "is represented as @xmath26 in term of the intensity @xmath27 ( in photon number units ) and the phase of the mode @xmath28 .",
    "we also assume the amplitude @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the intensity and @xmath31 is the phase of the driving field",
    ". in this case above threshold regime takes place for @xmath32 and above - threshold solutions are determined by the following expressions :    @xmath33 , \\nonumber ~\\\\ \\sin(\\phi -2\\varphi)=j ^{-1/2},\\label{hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath34 .",
    "these results are obtained in over transient regime and for large oscillatory mean excitation numbers , @xmath35 . using these equations",
    "we conclude that the system displays regular behavior of photon number @xmath27 versus @xmath36 for positive detunings , otherwise , for the negative detunings , the bistable regime is realized . beside this in the regular , above - threshold regime there exist actually two stable steady states , which have equal intensities but opposite phases @xmath37 thus we observe a phase locking with two fold symmetry .",
    "it is well known that the phase - locking phenomenon reflects the two - fold symmetry of the wigner function .",
    "it has been demonstrated in steady - state regime of opo under monochromatic driving @xcite .",
    "the situation of phase - locking with two - fold symmetry also arises for the composite system under consideration due to the quadratic form of the nonlinear term in the hamiltonian as it is realized for the pulsed pdnr ( [ h ] ) .",
    "indeed , considering the transformations : @xmath38 with the unitary operator @xmath39 we verify that the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) and the density operator of oscillatory mode satisfy the following commutation relations @xmath40=0 , \\label{comrel}\\ ] ] @xmath41=0 , \\label{disef}\\ ] ] if the parameters @xmath42 is chosen as @xmath43 .",
    "on the whole , it is easy to demonstrate that the wigner function displays two - fold symmetry in its rotation around the origin of the phase space : @xmath44 note that the polar coordinates @xmath45 are related to the complex plane @xmath46 and @xmath47 , with @xmath48 corresponding to the field operator @xmath2 in the positive p - representation .",
    "this result is obtained in the general form for arbitrary time - dependent amplitudes of external field and for all operational regimes of pdnr .",
    "in fact , such two - fold symmetry persists in the wigner functions when the pdnr is taken into the quantum chaotic regime , which will be discussed in the next section .    in the following ,",
    "we consider the phase - locking phenomena based on the wigner functions in phase space within both the regular and chaotic regimes of the pdnr .",
    "the wigner function is calculated by averaging an ensemble of quantum trajectories for a definite time instant . by analyzing the operational regimes of pdnr driven by the pulse train",
    ", we have concluded that the regular regime is mainly realized for positive detunings @xmath49 , while chaotic dynamics takes place for negative detunings @xmath50 .",
    "this result is in accordance with the above discussion of the case of monocromatic excitation of pdnr that exhibits bistability for a negative detung .",
    "indeed , just in the case of negative detuning the contribution of pulse train leads to controlling transition from bistable to chaotic dynamics in terms of the semiclassical solution .",
    "in addition , for chaos to happen , the other parameters of our model have to satisfy the following criteria : @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "it should be noted that the above conditions are specific to the pulsed pdnr , since for the standard pulse driven anharmonic oscillator without parametric term , quantum chaotic regimes are realized for both signs of the detuning .",
    "the typical results for the wigner functions corresponding to the cases of positive and negative detunings for the pulse driven pdnr are illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig.minmax ] , [ fig.wigners2 ] and [ fig.wigners1 ] .",
    "in this section , we analyse the phase - locking phenomena by determining the time - dependent excitation number and wigner function of the oscillatory mode .",
    "we calculate these quantities by averaging over an ensemble of quantum trajectories for definite time instants , and with respect to the parameters @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 as well as the parameters of the pulses corresponding to the regular and chaotic regimes .",
    "note that both the ensemble - averaged mean oscillatory excitation number and the wigner function are nonstationary .",
    "they exhibit a periodic time - dependent behavior , i.e. , they follow the periodicity of the driving pulses beyond the transient state of the system .",
    "the typical results on the dynamics of the photon number are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig.wigners ] for the negative and positive value of the detuning corresponding to the ( a ) chaotic and ( b ) regular regimes .",
    "we observe that the system operates in the strong quantum regime at a level of small excitation number for these parameter values .",
    "the ensemble averaged mean excitation number is clearly regular in both regimes .",
    "it demonstrates the well known result that quantum dissipative chaotic dynamics is not evident in the dynamics of the mean oscillatory number .",
    "nonetheless , it is possible to detect quantum chaotic behavior from other physical quantities , in particular , the wigner function .    , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 ; ( a ) @xmath59 , ( b ) @xmath60.,width=325 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig.minmax ] , we present our results on the wigner function in the strong quantum regime for both the regular and chaotic behavior of the pdnr . note that the results were selected at definite moment in time that corresponds to the minimal and maximal value of the mean excitation number depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig.wigners ] .",
    "we observe that all the wigner functions display two - fold symmetry in phase space according to eq .",
    "( [ wigpol ] ) .",
    "in particular , figs . [ fig.minmax](c ) and [ fig.minmax](d ) describe the formation of phase locked states for the regular regime as the photon number of the oscillatory mode increases . the single - peaked wigner function which occurs at the minimum of the excitation number @xmath61= 1 , is squeezed in phase space ( see fig . [ fig.minmax](c ) ) indicating the formation of squeezed states in the oscillatory mode . by increasing the excitation number",
    ", we observe the formation of two squeezed humps ( see fig . [",
    "fig.minmax](d ) ) at the maximum of the excitation number @xmath62= 9 .",
    "the two humps correspond to two states of equal photon number , but with two different phases of the cavity mode of the pdnr , which is above the generation threshold of the semiclassical approach .",
    "we notice that the distance between the two humps depends on the excitation number of the optical mode .",
    "interestingly , our results have uncovered the occurrence of phase - locking behavior at relatively small excitation number in the strong quantum regime .",
    "our results for the case of negative detuning are depicted in figs . [ fig.minmax](a ) and [ fig.minmax](b ) for time instants that correspond to the minimal and maximal values of the excitation number ( see fig.1 ( a ) ) .",
    "the latter result is cardinally different from the wigner function obtained for the regular operational regime .",
    "while the contour plots of the wigner function for regular dynamics are clearly bell - shaped and localized in a narrow region of phase space , the phase space distribution for the case of negative detuning is observed to be wider .",
    "in fact , we also observe a broadening of the corresponding excitation number distribution @xmath63 .",
    "the shape of the distribution is found to change irregularly depending on the duration @xmath7 and time interval @xmath8 between pulses .",
    "we conjecture that these wigner functions depict the chaotic behaviour of pdnr in the strong quantum regime . a detailed analysis of quantum chaos based on a comparison between the contour plots of the wigner function and",
    "the corresponding classical poincar section has been performed for the standard nonlinear resonator driven by a train of periodic pulses @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite that for comparatively small values of the ratio @xmath54 , the contour plots of wigner functions are relatively similar to the strange attractors in the poincar section .",
    "the main difference being the existence of fine fractal structures within the poincar section , which are absent in the wigner function .",
    "this is due to the hiesenberg uncertainty principle which prevents sub - plankian structures to appear in phase space .",
    "the consequence is a loss of correspondence between the quantum and classical distributions in the deep quantum regime .    by analysing the behavior of phase - locking in the chaotic regime of pdnr",
    ", we can easily conclude that the wigner function exhibits two - fold symmetry under a rotation of angle @xmath64 around its origin in phase space based on the general formula given by eq .",
    "( [ wigpol ] ) .",
    "thus , the parametric interaction of cavity mode in pdnr is observed to display two - fold symmetry in the phase space for both operational regimes .",

    "the results depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig.wigners2 ] show the initial stage of phase splitting of the optical mode for the two phases in both the regular and chaotic regimes .",
