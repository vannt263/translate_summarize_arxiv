    "recent experimental studies at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) have given strong evidences that the nuclear matter created in au+au collisions at @xmath3=200 gev has surprisingly large collectivity and opacity as reflected by its hydrodynamic behavior at low @xmath4  @xcite and its particle suppression behavior at high @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "this has led to the famous name of this high energy density and high temperature nuclear matter , sqgp , which can be interpreted as either strongly - interacting quark gluon plasma  @xcite , or super / perfect - fluid quark gluon plasma  @xcite .",
    "however , many of its important properties are still remain unclear so far , such as whether the newly - created partonic matter has been thermalized or not , etc .",
    "charm quarks can provide a unique tool to probe the partonic matter created in relativistic heavy - ion collisions at rhic energies .",
    "first , charm quarks are produced in the early stages of high - energy heavy - ion collisions due to its relatively large mass  @xcite .",
    "thus the charm total cross - section is believed to follow the @xmath10 scaling from @xmath7+@xmath7 , @xmath2+au collisions to au+au collisions at rhic energies if the nuclear modification to the parton structure function , the so - called emc effect  @xcite , is small .",
    "the direct measurement of @xmath0 mesons with low @xmath4 coverage in au+au collisions will allow us to extract this important information on the scaling properties of the charm production cross - section by comparing with the same measurement in @xmath2+au collisions .",
    "second , theoretical calculations have shown that the charm quarks interacting with the surrounding partons in the medium could change its flow properties  @xcite , such as its @xmath4 spectra shape , and could boost the elliptic flow ( @xmath14 ) of the final observable charmed hadrons besides the @xmath14 effect picked up by their light constituent quarks .",
    "thus experimental measurements for the @xmath4 spectra of the charmed hadrons and/or its decayed non - photonic electrons / positrons together with their elliptic flow properties in au+au collisions are particularly interesting to interpret the thermalization processes of the light quarks in the partonic matter .",
    "third , charm quarks are believed to lose much smaller energies compared to light quarks in the partonic matter due to the famous so - called  dead - cone \" effect  @xcite .",
    "a measurement of the nuclear modification factor for the charmed hadrons and/or their decayed non - photonic electrons / positrons compared to light hadrons is valuably important to complete the picture of the observed jet - quenching phenomenon and help us better understand the energy - loss mechanisms at parton stage in au+au collisions at rhic .",
    "the data used for this analysis were taken with the star experiment during the @xmath3=200 gev au+au run in 2004 and the @xmath3=200 gev @xmath2+au and @xmath7+@xmath7 run in 2003 at rhic . a minimum bias ( minbias ) au+au collision trigger was defined by requiring coincidences between two zero degree calorimeters ( zdcs ) .",
    "a 0 - 12% central au+au collision trigger was defined using the scintillator ctb ( central trigger barrel ) and both the zdcs .",
    "a 0 - 5% central data set is further selected by cutting on the event multiplicity in the 0 - 12% central data sample .",
    "the minimum bias event sample is subdivided into two centrality bins : 10 - 40% and 40 - 80% for the bemc non - photonic electron analysis .",
    "a minbias @xmath2+au collision trigger was defined by requiring at least one spectator neutron in the outgoing au beam direction depositing energy in a zdc .",
    "a minbias @xmath7+@xmath7 collision trigger was defined by coincidences between two bbcs ( beam - beam counter ) .    the low @xmath4 ( @xmath15 gev/@xmath6 ) @xmath0 mesons were reconstructed in minbias au+au and @xmath2+au collisions through their decay @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) with a branching ratio of 3.83% .",
