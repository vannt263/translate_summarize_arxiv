    "the effect of impurity and disorder on many body system has been one of the main themes of condensed matter physics@xcite .",
    "it plays an important role in our understanding of phenomena such as superconductivity , superfluidity , and kondo physics .",
    "the rapid progress in ultra - cold atom experiments provides a unique platform for the study of such many - body systems . in these experiments ,",
    "the external potential , the dimensionality , and the interaction can be tuned using external fields .",
    "fascinating many body phenomena have already been realized in experiments @xcite , including recent realization of a tonks - girardeau gas @xcite .",
    "a natural extension of this line of research is the study of the effect of impurities in these many body systems , both theoretically @xcite , and experimentally @xcite .",
    "here we study the tonks - girardeau gas in the presence of a local potential .",
    "a tonks - giradeau gas is a quantum gas consisting of hard core bosons .",
    "this system can be mapped to a free fermion system , allowing for an exact solution .",
    "the study of the effect of an impurity on such an exactly solvable system serves two purposes : first , it shows , in its simplest form , the interplay between interaction , superfluidity , and impurity .",
    "second , the theoretical predictions can be compared readily with experimental observables .",
    "the hamiltonian we use to describe such a system is of the tight binding type @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the bosonic operators that create and annihilate a particle at site @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "they obey the commutation relation @xmath4   = \\delta_{ij}$ ] .",
    "the particle interaction is included by imposing @xmath5 .",
    "the quantity @xmath6 which is generally negative , is the hopping amplitude between nearest neighbors and @xmath7 characterizes the local potential strength at site zero . the behavior of the many body system is determined by the ratio of @xmath8 .",
    "when @xmath9 , the kinetic parts dominate and the particles distribute uniformly to lower the kinetic energy . on the other hand , when @xmath10 the local potential becomes important .",
    "in this regime , local charge fluctuations are suppressed and  the coherence among particles is degraded .",
    "this degradation is a main interest of this paper .",
    "we numerically evaluate the spdm of the many - body ground state , and compute the effect of a local potential ( impurity ) on the spectrum of the sspdm , on the `` bec '' wavefunction , and on the superfluidity of the many - body ground state .    in order to solve for the ground state of the system , the hamiltonian([boson ] ) can be mapped to an non - interacting fermion hamiltonian via the wigner - jordan transformation@xmath11 here the @xmath12 and @xmath13 are fermionic operators , which satisfy the anticommunication relation @xmath14 . under this transformation , it is straightforward to show that the hamiltonian[[boson ] ] can be written in the following form @xmath15 the ground state @xmath16 of this hamiltonian corresponds to the well - known fermi sea , in which fermions fill the single particle levels up to the fermi surface .",
    "the corresponding ground state @xmath17 of the boson hamiltonian([boson ] ) can be obtained from @xmath16 by symmetrizing the corresponding many body fermionic wave function .",
    "we seek the one particle density matrix @xcite , which is the expectation value of @xmath18 in the ground state .",
    "@xmath19    the diagonal part of the density matrix , @xmath20 , gives the density @xmath21 at site @xmath3 , while the off diagonal part gives the coherence in the many body ground state for different sites . in the uniform case ,",
    "the coherence @xmath22 depends only on the difference , @xmath23 . in the presence of a local potential , however , the coherence depends on both @xmath3 and @xmath24 separately .",
    "in addition to that , @xmath22 is much smaller than its uniform counterpart when @xmath3 and @xmath24 are on different sides of the local potential . diagonalizing the density matrix",
    "gives a set of eigenvectors corresponding to the reduced one - particle states .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues represent the occupation probability for the corresponding reduced one particle states .",
    "the one with a significant large eigenvalue is the `` bec '' state @xcite ( note that in 1d , there should be no bose einstein condensation in the thermodynamical limit . in the particular case of the tonks - girardeau case ,",
    "the particles that condense into a single state are calculated to be order of @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "however , this state , compared with other states , is the only state that is significantly occupied . with this clarification",
    ", we will call that state the bec state and the corresponding occupation the condensate fraction ) .",
    "the evaluation of this density matrix is not simple even when the ground state is known .",
    "here we adopt the technique developed by m. rigol and a. muramatsu @xcite .",
    "this method allows us to calculate a system with up to a thousand lattice sites .",
    "we focus on the low occupation limit only , which corresponds to a continuum case .",
    "we have verified that 9 particles in 100 lattice sites already converges very well to the continuum case . in the following calculation ,",
    "unless otherwise stated , all the calculations are based on a system of 9 particles in one dimensional lattice of 100 sites , with an impurity located at site zero .",
    "periodic boundary condition is imposed on this one dimensional chain .    since all the physics",
    "is determined by the ratio @xmath8 , in the following numerical calculations , we fix @xmath26 and vary @xmath27 fig [ [ sps]a ] shows single particle density matrix spectrum for different us@xmath28the significant peak corresponds to the bec state occupation or condensate fraction .",
    "the introduction of an impurity lowers the condensate fraction , as shown in fig [ [ sps]b ] .",
    "the attractive and repulsive potentials almost equally deplete the condensate fraction for small impurity potential @xmath7 , with the attractive potential having a slightly larger effect .",
    "the physics that gives rise to this behavior , as is shown in the following , is that an attractive local potential has a stronger effect on decreasing the coherence between particles .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig1.eps       since only the bec state is significantly occupied , the bec state determines the most important features of the many - body system",
    ". it would be useful to look at the bec wavefunction itself(see figure [ [ mosps]a ] ) . for a repulsive local potential , we find that the bec density decreases near the impurity . in the case of an attractive potential , for @xmath29",
    ", there is an increase in the probability of the bec density at the impurity site . for the case of @xmath30 , in contrast to what one might expect ,",
    "there is a decrease of the bec density at the impurity site .",
    "this feature actually arises from the competition between two effects : the single particle effect , i.e. the potential attracts particles , and the many body effect , i.e. the impurity decreases the coherence among particles .",
    "we have also included the particle density plot in fig [ [ mosps]b ] .",
    "it shows an increase of particle density for any attractive potential . for the bec density",
    ", we see that , for each attractive potential , there is a peak at the impurity site corresponding to the local bound state .",
    "however , due to the lack of coherence between bound and extended states , the bound state is less likely to participate the bec state , which results in a overall decrease of the bec density at site zero compared with the uniform case .",
    "this is the main observation of this paper . to be more specific on how the impurity decreases the coherence among particles , we plot some of the relevant off - diagonal elements of the single particle density matrix ( see fig [ [ co ] ] ) in particular , we take the coherence between an arbitrary site and the fifth site next to the local potential site zero as an example .",
    "we find that , given the same distance , the coherence between particles on different sides of the impurity is much smaller than that of the particles located on the same side of the impurity .",
    "for the same magnitude of the attractive and repulsive potential , we find that the effect of the attractive and repulsive potential are roughly the same , with the attractive one having a stronger effect in decreasing the overall coherence among particles .",
    "this actually explains the fact the attractive potential has a stronger effect on decreasing the condensate fraction .",
    "the only place that the attractive potential resulting in a large coherence than the repulsive one with the same magnitude is near the impurity site .",
    "this is due to the presence of a local bound state , which effectively increase the probability of finding particles at the impurity site .",
    "this bound state is well known @xcite in the tight binding hamiltonian .",
    "its eigenenergy is @xmath31 and its wavefunction localizes in space as @xmath32   $ ] with @xmath33 being the site number and @xmath34\\ ] ] corresponds to the inverse of the characteristic length .",
    "the nice overlap of the coherence peak and the bound state wavefunction verifies our argument for the increase of coherence in the vicinity of impurity .",
    "the small peak in the impurity site is purely a single particle effect .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig2.eps    [ ptb ]    fig3.eps    with the picture of the impurity introducing decoherence , one would suggest that in higher dimensions , since the impurity has a weaker effect in decreasing coherence among particles , a smaller effect of the impurity should be found .",
    "we have verified this point numerically by extending our calculation to two dimensions the condensate fraction is shown in fig[[cf2d ] ] . at dimensions greater than one , there is no simple mapping from bosons to fermions .",
    "an exact diagonalization has been done for this case which limits the calculation to a system of five particles in a three by three lattice .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig4.eps",
    "it is well known that bec is neither necessary nor sufficient for the existence of a superfluid . as mentioned by lieb and sieringer@xcite ,",
    "a particular example is the tonks - girardeau gas .",
    "even it does not bose condense , the system without impurity actually exhibits superfluidity .",
    "it is interesting to investigate how the superfluidity is decreased in the presence of an impurity .",
    "we emphasize that we use the word superfluidity strictly in the sense of the following phenomenological definition@xmath35 where @xmath36 is the ground state energy of the many body system in the presence of a perturbative velocity field @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the superfluid fraction , @xmath39and @xmath40 is the mass of the particle .",
    "the velocity field is introduced by imposing a twisted boundary condition @xcite , which amounts to a phase jump @xmath41 , @xmath42 whenever the wave function passes through the boundary .",
    "we restrict @xmath43 to yield a single valued function .",
    "note that since the definition is based only on the static properties of the many body system , it can tell us only whether the ground state has the property of superfluidity , and it can not predict the stability of the superfluidity .    the result of numerical calculations is shown in fig [ [ sf ] ] .",
    "we see that without impurity , the system exhibits superfluidity with superfluid fraction close to unity .",
    "the degree of degradation on the superfluid fraction produced by impurity depends on both the local impurity strength and the size of the system .  in a large system ,",
    "the superfluidity drops sharply with the presence of the local impurity .  note that",
    "as far as the spectrum is concerned , the fermi ground state is equivalent to the boson ground state .",
    "this allows an understanding of the superfluidity in a single particle picture . as the lattice size increase",
    ", the particle kinetic energy goes like @xmath44 while the local potential energy goes like @xmath45 therefore , in the limiting case of large @xmath46 , the local potential always dominates the kinetic energy . for a repulsive potential , the particle has to hop through the barrier .",
    "for an attractive potential , since the local bound state is always occupied , for hard core bosons , in order to get through this potential , a potential barrier of order @xmath47 is also present , which gives rise to the sharp drop of superfluidity in the presence of a local potential .",
    "this problem can be understood quantitatively by considering the following single particle model @xmath48 , with @xmath49 defined in the regime @xmath50   $ ] with the twisted boundary condition . as an example",
    ", we consider only two states with energy close to @xmath51 . to calculate the eigenenergy with different boundary condition is elementary .",
    "it is just the one dimensional piecewise potential problem .",
    "the modification of eigenenergy due to the presence of the velocity field is @xmath52   /2=\\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}\\left ( 1 - 0.008g^{2}l^{2}\\right )   $ ] @xcite in the perturbative limit that @xmath53 is small .",
    "this result shows that the superfluid fraction is @xmath54 .",
    "there is no modification to first order in @xmath53 , which is consistent with discussions concerning repulsive and attractive potentials .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig5.eps",
    "the effect of an impurity on the tonks - girardeau gas can be studied in an experiment using an optical lattice .",
    "the local potential we model here may be realized in an experiment by introducing a laser beam , an impurity atom , or an ion at a particular lattice site .",
    "the real space density distribution will be the same as the free fermion in the presence of a local potential , which contains only information on the diagonal part of the density matrix .",
    "the non - trivial part of the density matrix , the off diagonal coherence ,  can be detected by measuring the momentum distribution , defined as @xmath55 we have ignored the localized wannier function profile .    in figure [ [ mpv ] ]",
    "we show peak value density in momentum space for different impurity strengths .",
    "the highest momentum density peak corresponds to the case with no impurity .",
    "the attractive potential has a larger effect on the broadening compared with the repulsive one .",
    "the superfluidity of the system can be measured by imposing a velocity field on the many - body system .",
    "this can be realized in the experiment by changing of the external potential with time .",
    "the measurement can be done by looking at the damping motion of the particles .        in summary , we have presented a numerical calculation of a tonks - girardeau gas in the presence of a local potential .",
    "it is shown that the impurity decreases the occupation of condensate fraction . the bec density at the local potential decreases in a strong attractive potential , as oppose to particle density , which always increases for attractive potentials .",
    "the superfluidity is also degraded by the impurity , the degradation scales like @xmath56 in the small @xmath53 limit .",
    "this effect of impurity on a many - body system can be measured by looking at the momentum distribution and the system response an external velocity field .",
