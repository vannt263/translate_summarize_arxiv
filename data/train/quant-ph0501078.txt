    "one of the most intriguing aspects , as well as fundamental , in quantum mechanics is entanglement .",
    "this feature was first noticed by einstein , podolsky and rosen @xcite who have originally proposed the epr experiment in order to show that quantum mechanics were not a complete theory to describe reality . at the same time schrdinger",
    "has done a formal discussion about the description and the measurements performed on two system which have interacted and that are far apart from each other @xcite .",
    "entanglement is of central importance in bell s theorem and is the origin of nonlocality in quantum mechanics .",
    "usually entanglement is understood as a consequence of some interaction of the particles in their common past .",
    "thus far , it has been achieved either by having the two particles emerging from the same source @xcite or by having the two particles interacting with each other @xcite .",
    "however , yurke and stoler @xcite and zukowski _ et al _ @xcite showed that one can entangle particles that do not even share any common past .",
    "the realization of the entanglement swapping was done by pan _",
    "et al _ @xcite in a scheme involving the horizontally and vertically polarized states of photons .    in a recent paper",
    "it has been suggested an experimental realization of teleportation of atomic states via cavity quantum eletrodynamics @xcite . in this work",
    ", guerra discusses theoretically how to prepare and how to detect atomic bell states .",
    "based on the results presented there , in the present work we show that it is possible to build a scheme to entangle the states of two atoms which have never interacted , along a similar line of ref.@xcite . in section 2",
    "we review the process of preparing atomic bell states for different atomic configurations and cavity fields . in section 3 we show that , through appropriate measurements of the bell states , we can perform the entanglement swapping and , finally , in section 4 we discuss our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we present four different schemes to prepare bell states involving two different configurations of the atomic levels .      consider a three - level cascade atom  @xmath2 with @xmath3 is far enough from resonance with the cavity frequency .",
    "consequently , it can be shown , according to the jaynes - cummings model @xcite , that this dispersive interaction can be represented by the time evolution operator @xmath4 where @xmath5 @xmath6 is the annihilation ( creation ) operator for the field in cavity @xmath7 , @xmath8 @xmath9 ,  @xmath10 is the coupling constant , @xmath11 is the interaction time , @xmath12 is the detuning , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the frequencies of the upper and intermediate levels respectively and @xmath15 is the cavity field frequency .",
    "in addition we assume that the transitions @xmath16 and @xmath17 are highly detuned from the cavity frequency so that there will be no coupling with the cavity field involving the state @xmath18 .",
    "however the state @xmath19 plays an important role in the following process , because we suppose that it is coupled to the state @xmath20 in the ramsey cavities which we shall use to prepare the atomic bell states involving the states @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , considering the atom - field interaction , the level @xmath23 will never be populated during the whole process so that we can ignore it from now on , since it will not play any role in our scheme , being important only as origin of the phase factor in the time evolution operator ( see eq.([u - ef ] ) ) due to the dispersive interaction .",
    "hence , we have effectively a two - level system involving the states @xmath20 and @xmath24 . in terms of them",
    "we can write the time evolution operator @xmath25 where the second term above was put by hand just in order to take into account the effect of level @xmath26 .",
    "let us take @xmath27 .",
    "we assume that we have a two - level atom @xmath28 initially in the state @xmath29 which , after crossing a ramsey cavity @xmath30 , is prepared in a coherent superposition @xmath31 according to the rotation matrix @xmath32 .",
    "\\label{m - a}\\ ] ]    now , let atom @xmath28 cross the cavity @xmath7 which is prepared in coherent state @xmath33 .",
    "a coherent state @xmath34 is obtained by applying the displacement operator @xmath35 to the vacuum , i.e. @xmath36 louisell and , experimentally , it is obtained with a classical oscillating current in an antenna coupled to the cavity .",
    "then , according to ( [ u - fg ] ) the system @xmath37 evolves to @xmath38 where we have used @xmath39 @xcite@xmath40 now , if atom @xmath28 enters a second ramsey cavity @xmath41 , where the atomic states are rotated according to the rotation matrix ( m - a ) , we obtain @xmath42    consider now a second atom @xmath43 prepared in the same way of atom @xmath28 , so that , before entering the cavity @xmath7 , we have it in the state @xmath44 let us send this atom through cavity @xmath7 assuming that  for atom @xmath43 , as above for atom @xmath28 , the transition @xmath45 is far from resonance with the cavity frequency .",
    "as above , taking into account the time evolution operator @xmath46 , eq .",
    "( [ u - fg ] ) with @xmath27 , after the atom has passed through the cavity , we get @xmath47 then , atom @xmath43 enters a ramsey cavity @xmath48 , where the atomic states are also rotated according to the rotation matrix ( [ m - a ] ) , which results in @xmath49 now , we inject @xmath33 in cavity @xmath7 which mathematically is represented by the operation @xmath50 @xcite and this gives us @xmath51    in order to disentangle the atomic states of the cavity field state we now send a two - level atom @xmath52 resonant with the cavity , with @xmath53 and @xmath54 being the lower and upper levels respectively , through @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath55 is sent in the lower state @xmath53 , under the jaynes - cummings dynamics @xcite we know that the state @xmath56 evolves to @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 and @xmath60 and if we detect atom @xmath55 in state @xmath54 finally we get the bell state @xmath61 which is an entangled state of atoms @xmath28 and @xmath43 , which in principle may be far apart from each other .    in the above disentanglement process we can choose a coherent field with a photon - number distribution with a sharp peak at average photon number @xmath62 so that , to a good approximation , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the integer nearest @xmath66 , and we could choose , for instance @xmath67 , so that we would have @xmath68 and @xmath69 . in this case the atom @xmath55  would be detected in state @xmath54 with almost @xmath70 of probability .",
    "therefore , proceeding this way , the atomic and field states will be disentangled successfully as we would like .",
    "notice that starting from ( [ a_1a_2c ] ) if we had injected @xmath71 in the cavity and detected @xmath54 we would get the bell state @xmath72    now , if we apply an extra rotation on the states of atom @xmath43 in ( eprphi+ ) in a ramsey cavity @xmath73 according to the rotation matrix @xmath74 we get @xmath75 and applying ( [ eprr5 ] ) on ( [ eprpsi- ] ) , it yields @xmath76 the states ( [ eprphi+ ] ) , ( [ eprphi- ] ) , ( [ eprpsi- ] ) and ( eprpsi+ ) form a bell basis @xcite which are a complete orthonormal basis for atoms @xmath28 and @xmath43 .",
    "it is important to notice that the efficacy of the process described above depends on a measurement which has a probabilistic character : the measurement of atom @xmath55 in the state @xmath77 after passing the cavity @xmath7 .",
    "although we can argue that the cavity @xmath7 may be prepared in a coherent state @xmath78 with a large mean photon number @xmath79 so that , to a good approximation , we have almost @xmath70 of probability of measuring atom @xmath55 in the state @xmath77 , we still have a small probability that it will fail . in the next section",
    "we discuss an alternative way to avoid this aspect .",
    "now , we start assuming that we have the cavity @xmath7 prepared in the state @xmath80 where @xmath81 refers to fock state . this state can be prepared by sending a two - level atom @xmath82 , in the lower state @xmath83 , first through a ramsey cavity @xmath84 , where the atomic states are rotated according to @xmath85 ,   \\label{rot_0}\\ ] ] and then through the cavity @xmath7 , initially in the vacuum state @xmath0 .",
    "the effect of @xmath84 is to perform the atomic state rotation @xmath86 we assume that @xmath82 is resonant with @xmath7 and that @xmath87 .",
    "thus , when @xmath82 cross the cavity , according to the jaynes - cummings model , @xmath88 does not change whereas @xmath89 evolves to @xmath90 .",
    "hence , the passage of @xmath82 through @xmath7 yields latexmath:[\\[\\frac{(|f_{0}\\rangle + i|e_{0}\\rangle ) } { \\sqrt{2}}|0\\rangle \\longrightarrow     @xmath7 in the state ( [ psic ] ) .",
    "as done in the previous section , let us consider three - level cascade atoms   @xmath2 with @xmath92 and @xmath24 being the upper , intermediate and lower atomic state , such that the transition @xmath93 is far enough from resonance with the cavity and the transitions @xmath94 and @xmath95 are highly detuned so that there will be no coupling with the cavity field .",

    "we have presented schemes to prepare atomic bell states involving three - level cascade atoms with two different cavity configurations . in the former case one deals with a cavity prepared in a coherent state @xmath117 , which is a feasible experimental task , but during the process one has to inject another coherent state inside the cavity and the final preparation of a bell state depends also of a probabilistic detection of the state @xmath77 . in the latter case",
    "one does not have to inject any field inside the cavity and the process is not probabilistic .",
    "however , one has to perform an extra rotation in the atomic states .",
