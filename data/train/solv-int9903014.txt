    "it is well - known that solutions for the painlev equations play a role of special functions in the nonlinear science  @xcite .",
    "originally , painlev derived these equations in order to find new transcendental functions determined by second order ordinary differential equations possessing so - called the painlev property .",
    "recently , irreducibility of solutions of the painlev equations has been proved by umemura  @xcite .",
    "umemura first gave a rigorous definition of classical functions : starting from the field of rational functions , if a function is obtained by finite numbers of iterations of the following permissible operations ,    * differentiation , * arithmetic calculations , * solving homogeneous linear ordinary differential equation , * substitution into abelian functions ,    then that function is called `` classical '' .",
    "umemura proved that solutions of the painlev equations are not classical in general in the above sense .",
    "however , it is known that they admit classical solutions for special values of parameters .",
    "one is the rational or algebraic solutions , and another is the transcendental classical solutions which are expressed by rational functions in various special functions and their derivatives .    in this article , we discuss the painlev ii equation ( p@xmath0 ) , @xmath2 and the equation of no . 34 in gambier s classification",
    "@xcite , @xmath3 which we call the painlev xxxiv equation ( p@xmath4 ) . in equations ( [ p2 ] ) and ( [ p34 ] ) , we adopted different scale from their canonical forms  @xcite , @xmath5 @xmath6 for the clarity of expression of solutions .",
    "the scale transformations , @xmath7 lead the canonical forms to our ones .",
    "we denote @xmath8 , p@xmath9 $ ] and @xmath10 , p@xmath11 $ ] , respectively , when it is necessary to show the value of parameter explicitly .",
    "these equations are related to each other by the miura transformation  @xcite , @xmath12 and its complement , @xmath13 umemura also proved that p@xmath0 ( and thus p@xmath4 ) admits transcendental classical solutions which are expressed by the airy function when @xmath14 is an integer , rational solutions when @xmath14 is a half - integer , and that otherwise the solutions are non - classical .",
    "it is known that the painlev equations ( except for p@xmath15 ) admit the bcklund transformations(bt ) which form the affine weyl group  @xcite .",
    "for example , bt of p@xmath0 is given by , @xmath16 and @xmath17 forms the affine weyl group of type @xmath18 . starting from a suitable `` seed '' solution",
    ", we obtain `` higher '' solutions by applying bt to it , which are expressed by rational functions in the seed solution and its derivatives .    it is interesting and important to note two points on classical solutions for the painlev equations .",
    "the first is that , in general , the classical solutions are located on special points in the parameter space from the viewpoint of symmetry .",
    "namely , transcendental classical solutions are on the walls of the weyl chambers , and rational solutions on their barycenters .",
    "the second is that the classical solutions have additional structure .",
    "namely , it is known that some of the classical solutions admit such determinant formulas that they are expressed by log derivative of the ratio of some determinants .",
    "moreover , application of bt corresponds to increment of size of the determinant .",
    "in fact , both airy function type and rational solutions for p@xmath0 and p@xmath4 admit such determinant structure .    then",
    ", does such determinant structure exist even for non - classical solutions , or are non - classical solutions so `` transcendental '' that do not admit even such structure ? here",
    "we also note that such determinant structure are shown to be universal among the soliton equations due to the celebrated sato theory  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this article is to generalize the determinant formulas of the classical solutions of p@xmath0 and p@xmath4 , and show that such determinant structure is universal among the solutions of p@xmath0 and p@xmath4 .",
    "the key to this generalization is to use the technique of the darboux transformation together with hirota s bilinear formalism .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ classical ] , we summarize the derivation of p@xmath4 and classical solutions of p@xmath0 and p@xmath4 .",
    "we illustrate our basic ideas in section [ darboux ] .",
    "our main results are presented in section [ result ] .",
    "the proof for our results are given in section [ proof ] .",
    "section [ conc ] is devoted to summary and discussions .",
    "it is well - known that p@xmath0 is derived as the similarity reduction from the modified kdv equation  @xcite , @xmath19 in fact , putting @xmath20 equation ( [ mkdv ] ) is reduced to equation ( [ p2 ] ) .",
    "similarly , p@xmath4 ( [ p34 ] ) is derived as the similarity reduction from the kdv equation , @xmath21 by putting @xmath22    it is known that p@xmath0 ( [ p2 ] ) is bilinearized to  @xcite @xmath23g\\cdot f=0,\\label{p2:bl2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by the dependent variable transformation , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an arbitrary function in @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is hirota s bilinear differential operator defined by @xmath28 the bilinear equations ( [ p2:bl1 ] ) and ( [ p2:bl2 ] ) are regarded as those for p@xmath0 , but it is also possible to derive p@xmath29 as follows . first we divide equations ( [ p2:bl1 ] ) and ( [ p2:bl2 ] ) by @xmath30 .",
    "then , putting @xmath31 and using the formulas  @xcite , @xmath32\\psi,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we obtain @xmath33 compatibility condition of the linear equations ( [ lin1:p34 ] ) and ( [ lin2:p34 ] ) gives p@xmath11 $ ] .",
    "let us discuss the determinant expressions for the classical solutions of p@xmath0 and p@xmath29  @xcite . in the following",
    ", the determinant with size zero should be regarded as @xmath34 .",
    "if we choose @xmath35 , then it is known that the bilinear equations ( [ p2:bl1 ] ) and ( [ p2:bl2 ] ) are satisfied by @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 satisfies the airy equation , @xmath40 thus , the airy function type solutions of p@xmath41 $ ] and p@xmath42 $ ] are given by @xmath43 respectively .",
    "the rational solutions are obtained for the case of @xmath44 , and there are two expressions for them .",
    "one is the schur function type expression given by @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 are the polynomials in @xmath26 defined by @xmath48 another expression is given by hankel determinant as @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 are the polynomials in @xmath26 , which are recursively defined by @xmath53 thus , the rational solutions for p@xmath54 $ ] and p@xmath55 $ ] are given by @xmath56 respectively .",
    "we note that it is possible to generalize the above result for negative @xmath14 by the reflection symmetry of p@xmath0 and p@xmath4 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively .",
    "indeed , this symmetry is generated by @xmath59 in equations ( [ bt : s ] ) and ( [ bt : t ] ) .",
    "the technique of darboux transformation is well developed in the soliton theory  @xcite .",
    "for example , in the case of kdv equation ( [ kdv ] ) , we start with its auxiliary linear problem , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the spectral parameter .",
    "then , one can show that equations ( [ lin : kdv ] ) are covariant with respect to the darboux transformation @xmath62 $ ] , @xmath63 $ ] defined by @xmath64=\\frac{wr(\\psi_1,\\psi_2,\\cdots,\\psi_n,\\psi)}{wr(\\psi_1,\\psi_2,\\cdots,\\psi_n)},\\ ] ] @xmath65=w+2\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}\\log wr(\\psi_1,\\psi_2,\\cdots,\\psi_n),\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is a solution of the linear equations ( [ lin : kdv ] ) with @xmath67 , and @xmath68 is a wronskian with respect to the indicated functions .",
    "thus , choosing an appropriate seed solution of kdv equation as @xmath69 , one can construct series of exact solutions by using this method .",
    "for example , starting from the solution @xmath70 , then we obtain the wronskian expression of @xmath71-soliton solution  @xcite .",
    "although most of the expression would be somewhat formal except for the soliton and rational type solutions or their variants , it is important that we can express quite wide class of solutions in terms of determinant .",
    "the above result is recovered by the following bilinear equations : @xmath72 @xmath73g\\cdot f=0 , \\label{g - bl2:kdv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "we omit the detail , but we can directly prove that these bilinear equations holds as the identity of the determinants from the linear equations ( [ lin : kdv ] ) .",
    "indeed , we recover `` usual '' bilinear equations by putting @xmath70 , @xmath76 @xmath77 > from these bilinear equations , we recover the kdv equation ( [ kdv ] ) and the auxiliary linear problem ( [ lin : kdv ] ) by putting as @xmath78    now , keeping this correspondence between the darboux transformation and the bilinear formalism in mind , let us illustrate our strategy to generalize the determinant formulas for the solutions of p@xmath0 and p@xmath4 .",
    "we have the bilinear equations ( [ p2:bl1 ] ) and ( [ p2:bl2 ] ) for p@xmath4 . clearly , these bilinear equations correspond to equations ( [ bl1:kdv ] ) and ( [ bl2:kdv ] ) . thus , if we could obtain `` generalized '' bilinear equations which correspond to equations ( [ g - bl1:kdv ] ) and ( [ g - bl2:kdv ] ) , it might be possible to find the darboux transformation for p@xmath4 and p@xmath0 which leaves the linear equations ( [ lin1:p34 ] ) and ( [ lin2:p34 ] ) covariant .",
    "then we obtain a generalization of the determinant formulas .    in the next section",
    ", we present our main results .",
    "in this section , we present a generalization of determinant formulas for the solutions of p@xmath0 and p@xmath4 .",
    "we start with a pair of linear equations ( [ lin1:p34 ] ) and ( [ lin2:p34 ] ) . as we mentioned in section [ classical ] , these equations are compatible provided that @xmath69 satisfies p@xmath79 $ ] . in other words , equation ( [ lin2:p34 ] ) follows if @xmath69 and @xmath80 are solutions of p@xmath11 $ ] and equation ( [ lin1:p34 ] ) , respectively",
    ". then we have the following theorem .    [ main1 ]",
    "let @xmath69 be a solution of p@xmath11 $ ] , and @xmath81 be a solution of the linear equation ( [ lin1:p34 ] ) .",
    "we define two sequences @xmath82 , @xmath83 ( @xmath52 ) by @xmath84 we define hankel determinant @xmath85 , @xmath86 by @xmath87 then , @xmath88 satisfies @xmath89\\psi_n = 0 , \\label{lin3:p34}\\\\ \\left(\\frac{d^2}{dz^2}+w-2z\\right)\\psi_n=0 ,                        \\label{lin4:p34}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 thus , @xmath91 satisfies p@xmath92 $ ] .",
    "similar formula for p@xmath0 is obtained by applying the miura transformation ( [ miura ] ) . the linear equations ( [ lin1:p34 ] ) and ( [ lin2:p34 ] )",
    "are reduced to @xmath93 then we have the following theorem .",
    "[ main2 ] let @xmath94 be a solution of p@xmath9 $ ] , and @xmath85 be hankel determinant given by equation ( [ tau : p34 ] ) , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are defined recursively by @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 then , @xmath98 satisfies p@xmath99 $ ] .    as mentioned in the previous section , theorems",
    "[ main1 ] and [ main2 ] is the direct consequence of the following proposition :    [ bl ] the following bilinear equations hold .",
    "\\tau_{n+1}\\cdot\\tau_n=0.\\label{bl2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in fact , dividing equations ( [ bl1 ] ) and ( [ bl2 ] ) by @xmath101 and using the formula  @xcite @xmath102\\psi_n,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we obtain the linear equations ( [ lin3:p34 ] ) and ( [ lin4:p34 ] ) in theorem [ main1 ] .",
    "similarly , dividing equations ( [ bl1 ] ) and ( [ bl2 ] ) by @xmath103 and using the formulas  @xcite ,",
    "@xmath104 with @xmath105 we get @xmath106 eliminating @xmath107 , we obtain @xmath108    these results imply that even non - classical solutions possess the same determinant structure as the classical solutions .",
    "indeed , the known determinant expressions for the classical solutions are recovered as special cases .",
    "in fact , starting with a solution @xmath109 for p@xmath110 $ ] , the linear equation ( [ lin1:p34 ] ) yields @xmath111 from which we get @xmath112 without losing generality . then , we have from the recursion relations ( [ rec0:p34 ] ) , ( [ rec1:p34 ] ) and ( [ rec2:p34 ] ) , @xmath113 @xmath114 thus , we have a series of rational solutions given by equations ( [ tau : p34 ] ) , ( [ rec : rational : p34 ] ) , ( [ rec2:rational : p34 ] ) and @xmath115 the case of @xmath116 agrees with the hankel determinant expression for the rational solutions discussed in section [ classical ] .    next , noticing that @xmath70 is a solution of p@xmath117 $ ] , we find from equation ( [ lin2:p34 ] ) that @xmath81 is determined by @xmath118 and the recursion relation ( [ rec1:p34 ] ) with equation ( [ rec0:p34 ] ) is reduced to @xmath119 thus , we have a series of solutions given by equations ( [ tau : p34 ] ) , ( [ airy2 ] ) , ( [ rec : airy ] ) and @xmath120 for @xmath116 , which agrees with the wronskian expression for the airy function type solutions discussed in section [ classical ]",
    ". however , the airy function type solutions are `` singular '' case in our formula . from equations ( [ rec0:p34 ] ) and ( [ rec2:p34 ] ) , we find that @xmath121 for all @xmath122 and thus @xmath123 for @xmath124 , which does not give meaningful result .",
    "we note that this phenomena is related to the symmetry of the @xmath125 sequence which will be mentioned in section [ conc ] , and the correct result for @xmath124 case is obtained by virtue of symmetry .",
    "we also note that this is the only singular case and our determinant formula works for other cases .",
    "in this section , we give the proof of the theorems [ main1 ] and [ main2 ] . since we see that these theorems follows immediately from proposition [ bl ] , it is sufficient to prove it .",
    "we have to prove both @xmath126 and @xmath124 cases , but we concentrate on the former case , since the latter case is proved in similar manner .    the bilinear equations ( [ bl1 ] ) and ( [ bl2 ] ) are reduced to the plcker relations , which are quadratic identities of the determinants whose columns are shifted",
    ". thus , we first construct such differential formulas that shifted determinants are expressed by operating some differential operator on the original determinant .",
    "for this purpose , we introduce the following notation :    let @xmath127 be a young diagram @xmath128 .",
    "then we define an @xmath129 determinant @xmath130 by @xmath131    then , we have the following differential formulas .

    "the proof for proposition [ shift ] is an important step .",
    "however , since this requires straightforward but tedious calculations , we will give it in [ proof - shift ] .",
    "finally , we prove proposition [ bl ] . > from the plcker relations we have , @xmath133 @xmath134 by using proposition [ shift ] , we get the bilinear relations ( [ bl1 ] ) and ( [ bl2 ] ) from equations ( [ pl1 ] ) and ( [ pl2 ] ) , respectively , which is the desired result .",
    "in this article , we have presented determinant formulas for the solutions of p@xmath4 and p@xmath0 which are valid also for non - classical solutions by using the technique of the darboux transformation and bilinear formalism .",
    "the solutions of p@xmath92 $ ] and p@xmath99 $ ] , @xmath86 , are expressed by determinants whose entries are constructed from the solution of some linear equations .",
    "moreover , coefficients of those linear equations include the solution of p@xmath11 $ ] and p@xmath9 $ ] , respectively .",
    "we have also shown that known determinant expressions for classical solutions are recovered as special cases .",
    "this result implies that determinant structure of the classical solutions is universal among the solutions of p@xmath0 and p@xmath4 .",
    "finally , let us discuss the relation with the toda equation , which will be a key for generalization to other painlev equations .",
    "in general , the @xmath125 function for p@xmath0 is introduced through its hamiltonian  @xcite , @xmath135 by @xmath136 we note that we obtain p@xmath9 $ ] for @xmath94 from the canonical equation , @xmath137 then it can be shown that @xmath8 , which is a solution of p@xmath9 $ ] , is expressed as @xmath138 by applying bt , we obtain a sequence of @xmath125 functions @xmath139 , where @xmath140 .",
    "okamoto has shown that bt of p@xmath0 is governed by the toda equation on the level of @xmath125 function :    ( okamoto  @xcite ) @xmath85 satisfies the toda equation , @xmath141 where @xmath142 is a non - zero constant .",
    "it is well - known that the solution of the toda equation ( [ toda ] ) is expressed by @xmath143 where @xmath39 is an arbitrary function in @xmath26 .",
    "equation ( [ toda : darboux ] ) is sometimes referred as `` darboux s formula '' .",
    "however , one should note that darboux s formula ( [ toda : darboux ] ) is valid under the condition , @xmath144 ( in practice , @xmath145 can be a constant . ) in @xcite , it is pointed out that the wronskian expression for the airy function type solutions of p@xmath0 is a consequence of the darboux s formula .",
    "we demonstrate how we could apply the darboux s formula for this case .",
    "we have a solution of p@xmath0 for @xmath146 , @xmath147 therefore , we can choose the @xmath125 functions as @xmath148 then we have a @xmath125 sequence for the airy function type solutions , @xmath149 now , as was mentioned in section [ classical ] , we have a reflection symmetry ( [ sym : u ] ) on @xmath94 which implies a symmetry on the @xmath125 function , @xmath150 in the case of the airy function type solutions , this symmetry induces a symmetry on the @xmath125 sequence as @xmath151 by virtue of this symmetry , we see that the @xmath125 sequence is divided into two parts as @xmath152 fortunately enough , since it can be shown that this @xmath125 sequence is governed by the toda equation ( [ toda ] ) with @xmath153 , we could apply darboux s formula for @xmath126 and @xmath124 separately",
    ". we note that if we prolong the @xmath125 sequence for @xmath124 following to the toda equation ( [ toda ] ) with the condition ( [ bc : darboux ] ) without taking the symmetry into account , we have @xmath123 for @xmath124 .",
    "this corresponds to the `` singular '' phenomena mentioned in section [ result ] .    in the case of rational solutions ,",
    "the @xmath125 sequence is again separated into two parts .",
    "however , we can not apply the darboux s formula to this case .",
    "let us take a solution of p@xmath0 for @xmath154 , @xmath155 we can choose the @xmath125 function as @xmath156 and we have a @xmath125 sequence for the rational solutions . now the symmetry ( [ sym : tau ] ) implies a symmetry on the @xmath125 sequence , @xmath157 and thus we have , @xmath158 and again the @xmath125 sequence is separated into two parts .",
    "however in this case , these @xmath125 functions are shown to satisfy the toda equation of the form , @xmath159 thus , we can not apply darboux s formula for the rational solutions .",
    "of course , by introducing a gauge on the @xmath125 function as @xmath160 then @xmath161 satisfy the toda equation @xmath162 however , now @xmath163 is not a constant .",
    "there are two points for being able to apply the darboux s formula .",
    "the first is that @xmath125 sequence should have a symmetry which is induced from the painlev equation itself so that the @xmath125 sequence is separated into two parts , which is necessary to apply the darboux s formula without inconsistency .",
    "the second is that @xmath125 sequence should satisfy the toda equation of the form ( [ toda ] ) under the condition ( [ bc : darboux ] ) .",
    "both conditions are satisfied for the airy function type solution , but the second condition does not hold for rational solutions . now , for solutions which corresponds to generic @xmath14 , the symmetry on the @xmath125 function ( [ sym : tau ] ) does not induce any symmetry on the @xmath125 sequence .",
    "this observation shows that it is not trivial that generic @xmath125 function admit determinant formula , even if it satisfies the toda equation .    despite of unavailability of the darboux s formula ,",
    "we could obtain the determinant formula for rational solutions .",
    "this is due to the determinant formula of the general solution of toda equation of c - type ( toda equation with the symmetry ( [ sym : c - toda ] ) ) obtained in  @xcite .",
    "conversely , the general determinant formula for p@xmath0 strongly implies that it is possible to construct the determinant formula for the general solution of toda equation in general setting , i.e. , the toda equation admits the determinant formula for the general solution without any symmetries or gauge on @xmath125 sequence .",
    "then , our results might be regarded as the special case of such general solution for the toda equation .",
    "moreover , it is known that the bcklund transformations for the painlev equations ( except for p@xmath15 ) is governed by various types of toda equations  @xcite .",
    "thus , it might be possible to present general determinant formula also for other painlev equations .",

    "here , we give the proof for proposition  [ shift ] .",
    "we first prove equation ( [ shift1 ] ) . notice that @xmath164 is expressed by @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the @xmath167-cofactor of @xmath85 and @xmath168 denotes a standard scalar product for @xmath169 matrices @xmath170 and @xmath171 which is defined as @xmath172 the first matrix of equation ( [ shift1-pro ] ) is rewritten by using the recursion relation ( [ rec1:p34 ] ) as @xmath173 the above matrix in the second term is separated as @xmath174 each of these terms gives zero contribution in equation ( [ shift1-pro ] ) . hence we obtain equation ( [ shift1 ] ) .",
