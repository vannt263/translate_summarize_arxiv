    "one of the most mysterious , challenging , but also useful consequences of quantum theory is the possibility of non - local correlations : the joint behavior under ( different possible ) measurements of a quantum system is such that it can not be explained by pre - shared ( classical ) information determining all the outcomes locally .",
    "this result by bell  @xcite can be seen as a late reply to the claim , in 1935 , of einstein , podoslky , and rosen  @xcite that quantum theory was incomplete and must be augmented by _ hidden variables _ ,",
    "i.e. , classical information predicting all measurements outcomes .",
    "it has been a prominent open problem `` why '' nature does display non - local behavior , yet no maximal one , i.e. , the behavior of a perfect pr box  @xcite can not be realized  @xcite .",
    "a number of attempts have been made to single out quantum correlations as compared to general non - signaling systems : are quantum correlations the ones that do not collapse _ communication complexity _",
    "@xcite , that are of no help for _ non - local computation _",
    "@xcite , or that respect _ information causality _",
    ", a principle generalizing the non - signaling principle to the case of limited communication  @xcite ?",
    "furthermore , it has turned out that non - local correlations have important applications for information processing , e.g. , device - independent cryptography or communication complexity . in all the mentioned contexts ,",
    "a question of paramount importance is the one of _ distillation of non - locality _ : given weak correlations , is it possible to generate stronger by some local wirings ?",
    "for instance , distillation can potentially lead to higher confidentiality levels or to a collapse of communication complexity by apparently weak correlations .",
    "in the two - party scenario , the possibility of distillation has already been extensively studied and , notably , led to complementary results adding up to a pretty complex picture : whereas _ isotropic chsh - type _",
    "@xcite correlations seem undistillable  @xcite , the same fails to be true in general  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in fact , certain arbitrarily weak chsh correlations can even be distilled up to arbitrarily close to perfect pr boxes by adaptive protocols .    in the case of three or more parties ,",
    "much less is known .",
    "it was shown that the straight - forward generalization of the ( non - adaptive ) xor protocol  @xcite to more parties fails to distill extremal boxes of the non - signalling polytope to almost - perfect  @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the present work is two - fold : first , we show that the natural generalization of pr boxes to @xmath0 parties has the property that non - isotropic faulty versions of it can be distilled to close - to - perfect by a multi - party variant of the bs protocol ( section iii ) .",
    "second , this result is used to show distillability for a much larger class of correlations , where the distillation is supported by partial communication , i.e. , a subset of the parties is allowed to communicate , where this communication _ alone _ is insufficient for generating the target correlation ( section iv ) .",
    "this result can alternatively be interpreted as arbitrarily weak non - local correlations having a `` communication value '' in the context of the generation of almost - perfect systems . in section",
    "v , the general results and procedures are illustrated with a representative example .",
    "here we define certain classes and specific types of @xmath0-partite boxes which we will use in our distillation protocols .",
    "they are generalizations of important bipartite boxes in @xcite .",
    "the most general type that we define is a _ full - correlation box_. intuitively speaking it has a correlation only w.r.t .",
    "full _ set of players .",

    "we denote the @xmath0-tuple of inputs as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath0-tuple of outputs is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 for all @xmath5 .",
    "the _ full - correlation box _ is characterized by the following conditional distribution : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a boolean function of the inputs .",
    "two special cases of this type of box are the _",
    "@xmath0-partite popescu - rohrlich box _ and the _ even parity box for n parties_. an _ @xmath0-partite popescu - rohrlich box _ ( or short _ n - pr box _ ) takes @xmath0 inputs @xmath8 and produces @xmath0 outputs @xmath3 according to the conditional distribution @xmath9 an _ even - parity box for n parties",
    "_ takes @xmath0 inputs @xmath1 and produces @xmath0 outputs @xmath3 according to the conditional distribution @xmath10 note that this latter box is _",
    "local_. a convex combination of the last two boxes is called a _ correlated non - local box for n parties_. the _ family of correlated non - local boxes for n parties _ is defined as follows : @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "brunner and skrzypczyk presented in @xcite a protocol for two parties that distills non - locality and in the asymtotic limit : all correlated non - local boxes are distilled to the maximally non - local pr box .",
    "this result can be generalized to all @xmath0-partite pr boxes protocol  [ prot ] .",
    "the protocol works as follows ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : dbsprot ] ) .",
    "all n parties share two boxes , where we denote by @xmath13 the value that the @xmath5th party inputs to the first box and by @xmath14 the value that the @xmath5th party inputs to the second box .",
    "the output bit of the first box for the @xmath5th party is then @xmath15 , and the output bit of the second box is @xmath16 .",
    "the n parties proceed as follows : @xmath17 and they output , finally , @xmath18 .",
    "[ prot ]    -pr boxes ]    with this protocol we are also able to distill a large class of boxes arbitrarily closely to the @xmath0-pr box .",
    "[ thm : bsprot ] the generalized bs protocol takes two copies of an arbitrary box @xmath19 with @xmath20 to an @xmath0-partite correlated non - local box @xmath21 with @xmath22 , i.e. , is distilling non - locality . in the asymptotic case of many copies , any @xmath19 with @xmath23",
    "is distilled arbitrarily closely to the n - pr box .",
    "since the protocol  [ prot ] and theorem  [ thm : bsprot ] are generalizations of  @xcite , the proof works almost in the same manner .",
    "we start with the initial two - box state of the protocol which is given by @xmath24    we apply the above distillation protocol and get the final box . as in @xcite , we use the notation @xmath25 , which means that the protocol takes two initial boxes , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , to one copy of the final box @xmath28 .    so we get the following relations : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .    after the application of the distillation protocol we get the final box , which is given by @xmath33 hence , @xmath34 .",
    "we are now able to determine what kind of boxes can be distilled by this protocol .",
    "if the protocol distills the box @xmath19 to @xmath21 then @xmath35 has to fulfill @xmath22 .",
    "we observe that all @xmath20 fulfill this condition and , therefore , the protocol distills any box of the family of correlated non - local boxes .",
    "we show that in the asymptotic regime of many copies , any @xmath19 with @xmath20 is distilled arbitrarily closely to the @xmath0-pr box .",
    "we are starting with @xmath36 copies of the box @xmath19 and get , finally , the box @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the @xmath39th iteration of the map @xmath40 the fixed points of this map are @xmath41 and @xmath42 . to analyze the stability of these two fixed points we calculate the eigenvalues of the jacobian ( since the map is one - dimensional , the jacobian is a real value and not a matrix ) . for the box @xmath43 ( @xmath41 ) , we find @xmath44 , so this box is repulsive .",
    "for the other box @xmath45 we find @xmath46 , so this box is attractive .",
    "the generalized bs protocol can be used for distillation protocols for full - correlation boxes , where the use of communication is allowed to some of the parties .",
    "that means we are looking for distillation protocols based on the generalized bs protocol , but that are also allowing one - way communication channels between some of the parties , that can be used as often as required .",
    "we show that we are able to distill a general class of full - correlation boxes arbitrarily closely to the maximum with such a protocol .",

    "the second box is defined as @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",
    "these two boxes can be calculated in parallel .",
    "finally the constructed box outputs to party @xmath5 @xmath84    [ lem : constr ] the constructed box is equivalent ( i.e. the joint probabilities are equal ) to the full - correlation box defined by @xmath85    the statement follows directly from the property of the full - correlation box that the set of outputs of any subset of @xmath78 parties ( or smaller ) is completely random @xcite , and the property that the xor conserves randomness in case of independence .",
    "theorem [ thm : comm ] and corollary [ cor : ungl ] state that a general class of full - correlation boxes can be simulated by distillation and classical one - way communication channels .",

    "the number @xmath86 of necessary one - way communication channels for simulating the full - correlation box with using the generalized bs protocol is @xmath87        in this proof , we replace full - correlation boxes with @xmath54 for @xmath88 by the full - correlation box with @xmath89 for @xmath88 , and all other @xmath59 for all @xmath90 keep their values .",

    "we take again the xor of the changed box and the local box .",
    "we start to prove part ( i ) of the theorem .",

    "we are making the same steps as before to replace these two boxes . in the end",

    "we have replaced the original @xmath0-pr boxes such that the general pr box with constant element does not correspond to the original @xmath0-pr box belonging to the biggest @xmath97 .",
    "this is possible , since we can replace this box first .",
    "we are now able to isolate the box belonging to the biggest @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , we allow all parties that appear at least twice as well as the parties that input all the time a constant to communicate their inputs and outputs to a party which acts also in the isolated box",
    ". we have isolated the general pr box , and we are able to apply the generalized bs protocol to this box . all the other generalized pr boxes that appear in the abstraction of part ( i ) in the theorem can be simulated by the communication of the parties and shared randomness .",
    "so we will need @xmath98 one - way - communication channels less than when we start from scratch .",
    "let f be a boolean function associated to an @xmath0-partite full correlation box , and let f be written as in lemma  [ lem : boolf ] . if @xmath70 and @xmath99 then @xmath100 [ cor : ungl ]    the statement follows directly from theorems  [ thm : commcl ] and  [ thm : comm ] .",
    "all extremal three - partite full - correlation boxes of the non - signalling polytope fulfill the preconditions of corollary  [ cor : ungl ] . for more parties",
    ", it is unknown how many extremal boxes also fulfill this precondition .",
    "in this example we want to distill some boxes up to the following full - correlation box : @xmath101    therefore , we determine first the above - defined sets and constants .",
    "let @xmath102 . from lemma  [ lem : boolf ] , we know that all @xmath54 for @xmath103 , and otherwise @xmath89 .",
    "this means that the given full - correlation box can be simulated by four 5-pr boxes with some constant inputs , where one of these boxes is local ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] a ) ) .",
    "we are also able to assign the set @xmath76 of non - local @xmath0-pr boxes that are needed to simulate the full - correlation box : @xmath104 each of these three non - local 5-pr boxes can be obtained from the original box by taking the xor of the original box and the local 5-pr box when every party inputs its bits except for the parties that input the constant 1 to the 5-pr box , they input 0 in both boxes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] b ) ) .",
    "if we apply theorem  [ thm : comm ] ( i ) , then we know that the non - local part of the original full - correlation box can be simulated by three connected @xmath0-pr boxes with no constant input .",
    "since we know @xmath76 , the number of required one - way communication channels for simulating the full - correlation box can be calculated with theorem  [ thm : commcl ] : @xmath105    obviously , this box is not local . to determine the distance ( measured in the @xmath106-norm )",
    ", we can use a linear program and get that the distance is 20 , and the closest local box ( not unique ) is given by    @xmath107    we start with the second part of the example , where we show in detail how we distill a box from the family @xmath108 , where @xmath109 , up to @xmath110 .",
    "we want to distill this box arbitrarily closely to the full - correlation box above . for that",
    ", we determine first which of the parties have to communicate .",
    "therefore , we calculate the number of parties that only belong to one of the non - local 5-pr boxes : @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 .",
    "this means that we isolate the box that belongs to the 5-pr box with three arbitrary inputs .",
    "this can be done in the same way as before : we input @xmath114 in @xmath115 and the local box and take then the xor of its outputs .",
    "then , we use one - way communication channels from party 5 to 4 and one from 4 to 1 .",
    "remember that the communication channels can be used as often as the parties want .",
    "hence , we are able to simulate perfectly the two 2-pr box , and the non - perfect 3-pr box can be isolated by communicating the inputs and outputs of the two 2-pr box to party 1 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : example ] c ) ) .",
    "we have isolated the box @xmath116 that is known to be distillable up to @xmath117 by the generalized bs protocol . in this way , we are able to distill the box @xmath115 up to the full - correlation box in the beginning .",
    "we get that the number of one - way communication channels that is needed for this kind of distillation is @xmath118 , i.e. , less than @xmath119 .",
    "we have considered the problem of non - locality distillation in the multi - partite setting .",
    "we have found , first , that arbitrarily weakly non - local non - isotropic approximations to the natural generalization of a pr box to @xmath0 parties are distillable by an adaptation of a protocol for two parties .",
    "second , this can be applied to showing that a much more general class of extremal correlations , including _ all _ purely three - partite correlations , can be distilled to using _ partial _ communication ( less than if no weak systems can be used ) . in this context , weak non - locality , hence , manages to replace communication between a subset of parties .",
    "it remains a challenging open problem to understand , classify , and apply multi - party non - locality better .",
    "it seems that for certain tasks ( such as randomness amplification ) , multi - party non - locality outperforms bipartite correlations .",
