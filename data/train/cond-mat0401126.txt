    "the physics of weakly disordered systems has been the subject of considerable interest over the past years .",
    "if interactions effects can be ignored , it is known that quantum interference effects lead to the localization of all electronic states in two - dimensions , even for arbitrarily weak disorder @xcite .",
    "that is , the ohmic conductivity of such systems vanishes .",
    "it is well understood how the localization is affected by external fields that destroy the phase coherence underlying the quantum interference effects , e.g. , magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "however , there still are open questions about the impact of an electric field , which does not break time reversal invariance , and thus has no direct impact on the interference effects .",
    "this is an important question , since transport experiments invariably involve electric fields . in the theoretical literature",
    ", one can find arguments that a weak electric field has no impact on the localization corrections at all @xcite , to arguments that predict a strong impact on the localization corrections already at very small fields @xcite , to arguments that predict immediate delocalization @xcite , to arguments that predict delocalization beyond a critical field strength @xcite .",
    "here we revisit this question . in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite , we find that an arbitrarily weak field destroys the localization .",
    "however , for weak disorder this effect is not observable at realistic temperatures .",
    "we consider a hamilton operator @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the momentum operator , @xmath3 is the electron mass , @xmath4 is the position in real space , @xmath5 is the electric field , and @xmath6 is a random potential . for the latter we assume a gaussian distribution with zero mean and a second moment given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the density of states and",
    "@xmath9 is the relaxation time in the self - consistent born approximation .    to investigate the impact of the field on the electron localization , we focus on the density relaxation , as described by the integral equation @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the initial distribution of the number of particles with energy @xmath12 at position @xmath13 , the propagator @xmath14 describes the evolution of this distribution , and @xmath15 is the laplace transform of the time dependent particle number density @xmath16 .    to calculate the density propagator",
    "@xmath14 we generalize the nonlinear @xmath0-model of ref .",
    "@xcite to allow for the presence of a weak electric field .",
    "the action takes the form @xmath17\\ ,             q_{\\alpha'\\alpha}(\\text{\\bf\\textit x}).\\ ] ] here @xmath18 numbers @xmath19 replicas , @xmath20 if @xmath21 , and @xmath22 if @xmath23 . the matrix field @xmath24 is defined on a @xmath25 grassmann manifold and has the properties @xmath26 and @xmath27 . the integration over real space is understood to be restricted to the classically accessible region , defined by the requirement @xmath28 .",
    "the generalized diffusion coefficient is given by @xmath29 in deriving eq .",
    "( [ i6 ] ) we have restricted the consideration to small fields , which satisfy the relationship @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the mean free path .",
    "it can be shown that the two - point propagator of this field theory determines @xmath14 .    to investigate the action ( [ i6 ] ) we parameterize the @xmath32 matrix @xmath24 in terms of real @xmath33 matrices @xmath34 , according to @xmath35 and expand the action ( [ i6 ] ) in powers of @xmath34 .",
    "for a one - loop calculation it suffices to keep terms up to @xmath36 .",
    "we first consider the gaussian approximation .",
    "the action ( [ i6 ] ) then yields a generalized diffusion equation for @xmath14 , @xmath37\\right)\\,p(\\text{\\bf\\textit x } , \\text{\\bf\\textit y}|e,\\omega)= \\delta(\\text{\\bf\\textit x } - \\text{\\bf\\textit y}).\\ ] ] this differential equation must be supplemented by boundary conditions .",
    "we require that the propagator vanishes at infinity in the classically accessible region , and that the current in the direction of the field vanishes at the classical turning point .",
    "the structure of the equation is a consequence of the symmetries of the action .",
    "it reflects the fact that the configuration averaged green functions are symmetric with respect to exchange of @xmath13 and @xmath38 , and invariant against generalized real - space translations @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "the general solution of eq.([i8 ] ) can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions . for our purposes , it is more illuminating to consider a special initial condition , namely , a homogeneous density @xmath41 of charge carriers , all with energy @xmath42 .",
    "an electric field is then suddenly switched on at time @xmath43 , so @xmath44 for such an initial charge carrier density the solution of eq.([i8 ] ) gives the probability for finding the charge carriers at time @xmath45 with energy @xmath46 if they had the energy @xmath42 at time @xmath43 , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the modified bessel function , and @xmath49 is the drude mobility .",
    "the first moment of this distribution , that is , the mean energy , increases with time according to @xmath50 this heating is accompanied by an ohmic current , @xmath51 the generalized diffusion equation ( [ i8 ] ) thus describes heating of the charge carriers due to the work done on the system by the electric field .",
    "eq.([i11 ] ) also shows that @xmath52 is indeed the mobility .",
    "fluctuations about the mean energy , calculated from the equation @xmath53 increase with time according to @xmath54 therefore , deviations from the mean energy are only negligible for small times , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 for @xmath57 the fluctuations about the mean energy are as large as the mean energy itself , so that the mean energy does no longer describe the state of the system adequately .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the solution shows that @xmath58 also sets the time scale for a change of the structure of a particle packet . at @xmath43",
    "the packet is a delta pulse in energy space , and for @xmath59 its spread is gaussian . in this limit",
    ", the width of the particle packet increases with time in the same way as in the absence of the field .",
    "therefore , the diffusion volume is not affected by the field for @xmath55 . however , at @xmath60 the particle packet undergoes a restructuring . for @xmath61 , the mean square deviation in the direction of the electric field increases with time according to @xmath62 here",
    "@xmath63 denotes an average with respect to the distribution @xmath64 . for @xmath61 ,",
    "the diffusion volume thus increases much faster with time than in the absence of the field .",
    "we now perform a scaling analysis of the action ( [ i6 ] ) , using the technique of ref .  @xcite . to this end",
    "we extend the dimensionality of the system from 2 to @xmath65 , and first consider the gaussian fixed point that describes a diffusive phase @xcite . at this fixed point ,",
    "the gaussian action is invariant against changes of scale of the form @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , if the electric field is scaled according to @xmath69 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath70 is a relevant operator with respect to the diffusive fixed point , with a scale dimension of 1 .",
    "if we assign a coupling constant @xmath71 to the terms quartic in @xmath34 , we find that @xmath71 decreases according to @xmath72 , so @xmath71 is an irrelevant operator with respect to the diffusive fix point for @xmath73 , and so are all terms of higher order in @xmath34 .",
    "since the scale dimension of the diffusion coefficient @xmath74 at the diffusive fix point is zero , we have the scaling equation @xmath75 putting @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , we find @xmath78 equation ( [ i16 ] ) suggests that in two - dimensions the weak - localization correction to the diffusion coefficient are logarithmic with respect to @xmath70 .",
    "we have verified this by an explicit calculation of the one - loop corrections .",
    "the corrections obtained in this way are the same as those obtained in ref.@xcite .    for @xmath79",
    "there are two scaling regimes . for small @xmath80",
    "the scaling of the diffusion coefficient is governed by the field , and for large @xmath80 , by the frequency .",
    "the scaling analysis shows that the crossover between these scaling regimes occurs at @xmath81 , where @xmath82 . as one would expect from these arguments , the explicit calculation of the one - loop corrections yields @xmath83 , where @xmath84 .    the critical fixed point , which describes the anderson localization transition in the absence of an electric field , is more complicated .",
    "it can not be found by power counting alone , but rather requires an explicit calculation within the framework of a loop expansion @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the scale dimension of @xmath70 is determined by the loop expansion . however , in @xmath65 the scale dimensions at the diffusive and the critical fixed points , respectively , differ only by terms of @xmath85 . the leading contribution to the scale dimension",
    "@xmath86 $ ] of @xmath70 is therefore still given by power counting , and we have @xmath87 = 1 + o(\\epsilon ) .",
    "\\label{last}\\ ] ] the electric field is thus a relevant operator with respect to the anderson localization fixed point . strictly speaking",
    ", this discussion shows only that the localization fixed point is unstable in the presence of an electric field , and it does not tell what happens instead",
    ". however , explicit perturbative calculations to one - loop order suggest that there is a metallic phase in @xmath88 for @xmath89 .",
    "the arguments presented above show that in a weak electric field the scaling of the dc - conductivity at asymptotically low temperatures is governed by the electric field .",
    "however , any experiment effectively measures the conductivity at a frequency or temperature given by the inverse phase relaxation time , @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , the impact of the field on the weak - localization corrections can only be observed if @xmath91 .",
    "quantitative estimates show @xmath92hz , while a typical phase relaxation rate at dilution refrigerator temperatures is on the order of @xmath93hz .",
    "the field scaling is therefore not observable in current experiments .",
    "these considerations solve the following paradox . while it is true that an arbitrarily small electric field destroys localization , as was found by kirkpatrick @xcite",
    ", this effect manifests itself only at unobservably low temperatures .",
    "this explains why the experimental results are consistent with the zero - field theory , even though electric fields are present in the transport experiments .",
    "we finally note that in our model inelastic collisions are not taken into account .",
    "therefore , our results apply only to samples that are shorter than the energy relaxation length .",
    "the consideration of inelastic collisions is important in order to establish a nonequilibrium steady state characterized by an effective electron temperature . in our present treatment",
    "such a steady state is absent ; the charge carriers are continuously heated up .",
    "we therefore plan further investigations that will focus on energy relaxation processes .",
