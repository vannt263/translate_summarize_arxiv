    "they are of importance at @xmath23 for which the chooz limit @xmath318 ( at 95% c. l. ) is saturated .",
    "the parameters chosen to make this comparison are @xmath319 ev@xmath9 , @xmath320 ev@xmath9 , @xmath321 , @xmath322 , @xmath323 and @xmath324 gev .",
    "thus , the ensuing comparison is not affected by dropping subleading @xmath23 effects . a normal mass hierarchy ( @xmath67 )",
    "is assumed .",
    "we will comment on the comparison involving an inverted mass hierarchy .",
    "figure  [ fig : comparison1 ] shows @xmath109 and @xmath326 versus distance for @xmath327 , and @xmath328 .",
    "the agreement between the analytic formulae ( solid lines ) and the numerical results ( dashed lines ) is excellent for distances up to about 4000 km . beyond that , the overlap between the lines degrades and for @xmath329 km , the analytic equation completely breaks down . the analytic expression for @xmath326 works for much longer distances than that for @xmath109 .",
    "analogously , for the inverted mass hierarchy , @xmath109 is valid to longer distances than @xmath326 .",
    "reference  @xcite claims good agreement between the analytic and numerical results for @xmath90 even larger than 10000 km when a constant density is assumed for the earth s density profile .",
    "the use of a realistic density profile as in the prem model shows that the agreement deteriorates at much smaller distances .    for the sake of completeness we display the corresponding comparisons for @xmath255 , @xmath330 and @xmath311 in figs .",
    "[ fig : comparison2 ] and  [ fig : comparison3 ] .",
    "the parameter values chosen are the same as for fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison1 ] . the range of validity of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : petau ] ) and  ( [ eq : petaubar ] ) is the same as for eqs .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) and  ( [ eq : pbar ] )",
    ". however , eq .  ( [ eq : pmutau ] ) agrees almost exactly with the numerical result for the entire range considered .",
    "this is because matter effects are very small in comparison to the leading contribution .",
    "for the same reason , @xmath309 is almost identical to @xmath311 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison4 ] , we show how well the analytic probabilities @xmath109 and @xmath331 agree with the numerical integration for @xmath332  km ( the longest baseline emphasized in this work ) as a function of neutrino energy .",
    "the oscillation parameters used are the same as for fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison1 ] .",
    "the precision is remarkable for the spectrum of energies of interest . for shorter baselines ,",
    "the agreement gets even better .",
    "we now make some cautionary remarks .",
    "our comparisons were made for @xmath333 , the parameter in which the series was expanded , and @xmath323 which is assumed to be no greater than of @xmath312 .",
    "these values are motivated by the existing reactor bounds and global fits to the atmospheric and solar data .",
    "however , as either of these parameters gets larger , the agreement between the analytic equations and the numerical results deteriorates at long baselines even if subleading @xmath23 effects are included .",
    "conversely , the agreement improves with smaller values of @xmath66 and @xmath23 . as a rule of thumb",
    ", we recommend that the constant density approximation to the probabilities be used only for distances less than 4000 km .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:14 ] , for @xmath334 km , the density profile is nearly constant for most of the neutrino path , thereby satisfying the implicit assumption ( of a constant density profile ) under which analytic probabilities are valid .",
    "we have stated that the analytic expressions are accurate for @xmath335 gev for baselines of 4000 - 5000 km .",
    "this robust bound can be relaxed for @xmath207 km to @xmath91 as low as 0.05 gev . however , for such low values of @xmath91 , the sensitivity of the analytic probabilities to @xmath66 and @xmath23 is high and care must be taken in their use .",
    "for example , a comparison with a numerical integration is desirable if @xmath66 and @xmath23 are relatively large .",
