    "the off - diagonal element @xmath4 in the ckm matrix is extracted from measurements of the @xmath5 process in the limited region of lepton momentum  @xcite , or the hadronic recoil mass @xmath6  @xcite , or @xmath6 and the leponic invariant mass squared @xmath7  @xcite where the contribution of background from the @xmath8 process is suppressed . in order to determine",
    "@xmath9 we need to extrapolate measured rates from such limited regions to the whole phase space .",
    "this extrapolation factor is evaluated using a theoretical prediction that takes into account the residual motion of the @xmath0-quark inside the @xmath10 meson , so called `` fermi motion ''  @xcite .",
    "fermi motion is included in the heavy quark expansion by resumming an infinite set of leading - twist corrections into a shape function of the @xmath0-quark@xcite .",
    "since the shape function is not calculable theoretically , it has to be determined experimentally .    the best way is to make use of the photon energy spectrum for @xmath3 since both the inclusive decay spectra in @xmath5 and @xmath11 are expressed by the same shape function up to leading order of @xmath12 in the heavy quark expansion  @xcite .",
    "the first results were obtained by cleo  @xcite , but the errors of the shape function parameters are rather large .",
    "therefore the uncertainty of the shape function dominates the theoretical error of @xmath9 at present .",
    "belle has recently provided more precise data than cleo of the @xmath13 photon spectrum  @xcite .",
    "we report on the results of determination of the shape function parameters using the belle @xmath11 data .",
    "we used a method based on that devised by the cleo collaboration@xcite .",
    "we fit monte carlo ( mc ) simulated spectra to the raw data photon energy spectrum .",
    "`` raw '' refers to the spectra that are obtained after the application of the @xmath14 analysis cuts .",
    "the use of `` raw '' spectra correctly accounts for the lorentz boost from the @xmath10 rest frame to the center of mass system , energy resolution effects and avoids unfolding .",
    "the method is as follows ;    1 .",
    "assume a shape function model .",
    "2 .   simulate the photon energy spectrum for a certain set of parameters ; @xmath15 .",
    "3 .   perform a @xmath16 fit of the simulated spectrum to the data where only the normalization of the simulated spectrum is floated and keep the resultant @xmath16 value .",
    "repeat steps 2 - 3 for different sets of parameters to construct a two dimensional grid with each point having a @xmath16 .",
    "5 .   find the minimum @xmath16 on the grid and all points on the grid that are one unit of @xmath16 above the minimum .",
    "repeat steps 1 - 5 for a different shape function model .",
    "three shape function forms suggested in the literature are employed ; exponential , gaussian and roman@xcite .",
    "these are described in table  [ tab : sfforms ] .",
    "the shape function @xmath17 is a function of @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the residual momentum of the @xmath0-quark in the @xmath10 meson , defined through @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the @xmath23 component along the direction of the @xmath24-quark .",
    "the shape function is parameterized by @xmath1 and @xmath25 .",
    "these parameters are related to the @xmath0 quark mass , @xmath26 , and the average momentum squared of the @xmath0 quark , @xmath27 , via the relations , @xmath28 and @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the mass of the @xmath10 meson .",
    "up to leading order in the non - perturbative dynamics the shape function is universal in describing the @xmath0-quark fermi motion relevant to @xmath0-to - light quark transitions .",
    "the lepton and photon energy spectra in @xmath31 and @xmath32 decays are given by the convolution of the respective parton - level spectra with the shape function .",
    "example shape function curves are plotted in figure  [ fig : sfcurves](a ) .",
    "exponential & @xmath33 + gaussian & @xmath34 + & where @xmath35 + roman & @xmath36 + & where @xmath37 +     +   +   +   +   +   +    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the cleo collaboration has provided points which lie on their equivalent @xmath38 contour for the case of an exponential shape function model@xcite .",
    "the data points are slightly different from those given in the gibbons report@xcite since the present data now includes the uncertainty in the @xmath39 background monte carlo normalization@xcite .",
    "we fit the functional form given in equation  [ eqn : ellipse ] to their contour data and find excellent agreement ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) .",
    "the minimum @xmath16 point for the cleo data corresponds to @xmath45 .",
    "we compare the cleo and belle contours in figure  [ fig : comb ] .",
    "the regions bounded by the contours marginally overlap . the uncertainty in the belle result is much reduced with respect to that of cleo .",
    "unfortunately we can not produce a combined @xmath38 contour of the two experiments since a precise map of @xmath46 as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 is not currently available for cleo .",
    "contours for cleo ( blue ) and belle ( red ) assuming an exponential shape function form.[fig : comb ] ]",
    "we have determined the @xmath0-quark shape function parameters , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , from fits of monte carlo simulated spectra to the raw belle measured @xmath47 photon energy spectrum .",
    "raw refers to the spectrum as measured after the application of analysis cuts .",
    "we used three models for the form of the shape function ; exponential , gaussian and roman .",
    "we found the best fit parameters ; @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are measured in units of @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively .",
    "we also determined the @xmath53 contours in the @xmath15 parameter space for each of the assumed models .",
