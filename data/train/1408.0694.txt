    "social media networking websites like twitter and facebook have fundamentally changed how people communicate and socialize in the 21st century . with over 200 million users on the popular microblogging site twitter in 2011 @xcite , exploring the social impact of using such a service becomes ever more important .",
    "although twitter has been considered by critics as a site where people tweet ( i.e. update statuses ) about mundane things such as what they are having for dinner , researchers have recently taken an interest in twitter to study social - behavioral attitudes @xcite , positive and negative influences of popular users @xcite , and even temporal patterns of happiness using ideas from linguistics @xcite . in this emerging culture of tweeters ( i.e. one who tweets ) that connect from places all over the world",
    ", there also comes the bigger problem of cyberbullying @xcite .",
    "twitter connects people by allowing them to send short bursts of information , called tweets , consisting of up to 140 characters in length , to other users .",
    "what makes twitter different from other social networking sites is the character limit imposed on tweets , along with its asymmetrical nature : you may follow someone , but they do not have to follow you .",
    "a user has three different types of relationships with fellow tweeters : you can have followers ( i.e. friends ) , which are people who follow you and can see your tweets ; you can also have people who you are following ; and finally there are bi - directional friends , which are people who are mutually following each other .    despite the different relationships that occur on twitter ,",
    "when a user tweets to the twitter community , a response is not necessary .",
    "user s friends can see all the tweets sent by the user .",
    "to involve a particular person in a tweet or a conversation , common practice is to use ` @ ' followed by a unique identifier address . to join a conversation , one can reply to a tweet , which uses ` @ ' .",
    "one can also retweet , which allows a user to tweet the same message to all his / her friends while giving credit to the original tweeter , allowing the message to reach a wider range of twitter users @xcite . for simplicity of presentation in this analysis",
    ", we use the term  retweet \" to describe both types of message repetition . in their retweets",
    ", users can use a hashtag , denoted by ` # , ' which declares a tweet as being a part of a larger conversation whose topic is related to the phrase which comes after the hashtag @xcite .",
    "we differentiate between keywords and hashtags : hashtags are used to identify the topic of a tweet , while keywords are found in the actual tweet .",
    "since the advent of social media sites like twitter , there has been research on cyberbullying @xcite .",
    "some research into methods for stopping cyberbullying on twitter can be found in xu _",
    "_ @xcite . in their report , the authors used natural processing techniques to recognize traces of bullying tweets @xcite , and gorzig and frumkin suggested raising awareness for adolescents , especially with regard to privacy settings @xcite . while a user can block another person specifically on twitter , no current method exists to block offensive or hurtful tweets from the twitter community . per the terms of services , twitter does not currently suspend accounts for cyberbullying ( available at http://twitter.com/tos ) . in this study , we employ a concept refered to as  quarantine \" that would enable twitter to temporarily separate offenders from the twitter community , therefore protecting users from the spread of offensive messages .    in this analysis , we extended the deterministic compartmental model developed by zhao _",
    "et al . _ for rumor spreading in the new media age @xcite . in the model",
    ", they built on the pioneering work of daley and kendall @xcite , who in 1965 introduced a model that looks at the spread of rumors as a non - standard contagion process .",
    "the daley - kendall model was the first rumor spreading model developed , it used the terms ignorants , spreaders and stiflers analogous to the disease model classes of susceptible , infected and recovered , respectively .",
    "et al . _ also looked at the maki - thompson rumor model @xcite , which showed the spreading of rumors through direct contact between spreaders and others , and the model developed by nekovee _",
    "et al . _ which combined the sir epidemic model and the maki - thompson model on complex social networks @xcite . by drawing inferences from these models , zhao _",
    "_ developed their own model which included a  hibernator \" class where the members of this class become disinterested in spreading the rumor but could become interested in spreading the same rumor again .",
    "we considered instead a model where users are  quarantined , \" i.e. users are limited in their ability to spread the rumor through the enforced limitation on their contact with other members of the population . to do this",
    ", we developed a discrete - time compartmental model that simulates the dynamics of rumor spreading in social networks , and examined how user s degree of quarantine hinders the spread of offensive messages .",
    "we estimated model parameters by comparing the model predictions to patterns observed in twitter data related to a topic that communities would find offensive .    in the following sections we describe the sources of data used in this analysis and give a description of the discrete - time compartmental model used to simulate spread of tweets , followed by a presentation and discussion of results .",

    ", we conducted a search on the twitter website and searched for trending hashtags which contained offensive language .",
    "we noticed that anti - gay sentiment is prevalent on twitter so we chose words that expressed disgust towards the gay community to use as an example .",

    "we developed a discrete - time model to simulate the dynamics of the spread of messages on twitter , because tweets occur at discrete times , whereas a continuous - time model includes a variable window of times between the tweets . in the following subsections ,",
    "we describe a basic model of twitter message spreading dynamics that does not include a quarantine class .",
    "we determined an expressions for the threshold value of this model , then we extended the model to include a quarantined class and discuss the implications that the addition of this class has for the threshold values of the system .",
    "a simple discrete - time rumor model for describing the spread of a message in a social network is : @xmath19 which was proposed by zhao _",

    "the parameter @xmath25 is the probability of seeing an offensive tweet , and @xmath26 is the probability of an offender becoming a stifler . to ensure that these two probabilities lie between 0 and 1 , we use the form @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath16 is the degree of the network , which is estimated from studies of twitter data in the published literature , as described in the previous section .",
    "the parameters of the model are shown in table [ tab : params ] and the compartmental diagram is shown in figure [ model : basiccomp ] .",
    "in lemma  [ lem : gt0 ] in appendix a we show that if the initial values of @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are non - negative , then all future populations in those classes will be non - negative . taken in conjunction with the fact that the system is bounded such that the populations in each of the classes sums to @xmath31 ( see lemma  [ lem : bound ] in appendix a )",

    "there are two equilibrium points :    @xmath50    the first equilibrium point represents the case where there are only offenders , because the only way for an offender to leave the class is to come in contact with a stifler , of which there are none .",
    "the second equilibrium point is analogous to the disease - free equilibrium because there is no one in the offender class .",
    "we refer to this point as the offender - free equilibrium ( ofe ) .",
    "the jacobian for this basic model is : @xmath51    the eigenvalues of the jacobian corresponding to the first equilibrium point , ( @xmath52 ) , which we refer to the offender - only equilibrium , are : @xmath53 we note that @xmath33 and thus the third eigenvalue is always greater than 1 . we thus conclude that the first equilibrium point is not stable .",

    "thus there always exists at least one value of @xmath60 such that the first eigenvalue is less than 1 .",
    "however , the other two eigenvalues , @xmath61 are equal to 1 , which does not _ a priori _ indicate that the equilibrium point is unstable , but neither does it imply stability .",
    "eigenvalues equal to one can result from system constraints not being applied .",
    "we note that one of the equations in system  [ eqn : basic ] can be removed if we apply the constraint @xmath62 . evaluating the eigenvalues of the jacobian of this reduced system about the offender - free equilibrium yields @xmath63 the jury criterion is an algorithmic method based upon the characteristic equation of the jacobian that is used to assess the stability of discrete systems@xcite .",
    "a prior condition for use of the method is that the characteristic equation @xmath64 , must be greater than zero when @xmath65 .",
    "this condition is not met for this model , thus we can not apply the jury criterion . thus , in order to assess the stability of this equilibrium point , we would have to resort to higher - order methods , rather than just linearization of the system about the offender - free equilibrium @xcite .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this paper , and we thus conclude that that the stability of the offender - free equilibrium in this model is currently indeterminate .",
    "to calculate the next generation matrix of the model , we use the methods of allen and van den driessche , 2008  @xcite , and we reorder the columns and rows of the offender - free jacobian in equation   such that the offender ( infected ) class comes first , and the uninformed and stifler ( uninfected ) classes follow .",
    "then , as in @xcite , we identify the components of this jacobian with the following form : @xmath66 then the matrix @xmath67 is given by @xmath68 the matrix @xmath69 is @xmath70 and the matrix @xmath71 is @xmath72    the next generation matrix ( ngm ) is defined by @xmath73 .",

    "we thus do not identify @xmath76 with the reproduction number , but note with interest that it matches the expression in equation   that we had shown could be used as a threshold expression for @xmath49 .      to examine how isolation of offending users would hinder the spread of offensive tweets , we extend the basic model in equation by adding a quarantine class where the parameter @xmath77 is the probability that an offender becomes quarantined .",
    "we also include a parameter @xmath78 that describes the probability that a person in the quarantine class becomes a stifler . when @xmath79 is close to one the offenders spend longer in the quarantine class then when @xmath79 is close to zero .",
    "the discrete - time equations of this extended model are : @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are as in the basic model , @xmath83 the parameters of the model are shown in table [ tab : params ] and the compartmental diagram is shown in figure [ flow_chart2 ] .",
    "compartmental model structure , height=240 ]    as before in the basic model , the sum of the populations in each of the classes adds to a constant , @xmath31 .",

    "a , we show that if @xmath84 then @xmath44 .",
    "since @xmath45 monotonically decreases to zero , and @xmath85 monotonically increases because @xmath42 monotonically increases , we see that @xmath47 montonically decreases to zero .",
    "thus , just as in the basic model , there will always exist a point at which @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "however , we note that the smaller the @xmath86 ( ie ; the higher the quarantine fraction @xmath87 ) , the faster @xmath47 will decrease to 0 .    in theorem  [ thm : threshb ] in appendix",

    "we note that @xmath94 and @xmath95 for twitter data , thus @xmath91 .",
    "thus for twitter data there exists a quarantine fraction @xmath86 such that the spread of offensive messages will be guaranteed to decline at the next time step .",
    "there are two equilibrium points for the model with the quarantine class : @xmath96    the first equilibrium point is biologically irrelevant because it implies that the stifler class will have a negative population since @xmath97 .",
    "therefore we disregard this equilibrium point .",
    "the second equilibrium point is analogous to the offender - free equilibrium of equation .",
    "the jacobian of the system is : @xmath98 + the eigenvalues of the jacobian evaluated at the offender - free equilibrium are @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 .    as in section  [ section : basic ]",

    "however the first eigenvalue is exactly equal to one .",
    "as before , we find that the jury criterion can not be applied to assess the stability of this equilibrium point , so we conclude that we find the stability to be currently indeterminate .    as in section [ section : basic ] , we begin computation of the next generation matrix for this system by reordering the equations such that the infected classes ( offender and quarantine ) classes come first , and the uninfected ( uninformed and stifler ) classes follow@xcite .",

    "<S> the 21st century has redefined the way we communicate , our concept of individual and group privacy , and the dynamics of acceptable behavioral norms . </S>",
    "<S> the messaging dynamics on twitter , an internet social network , has opened new ways / modes of spreading information . as a result cyberbullying or in general , the spread of offensive messages , is a prevalent problem . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this report is to identify and evaluate conditions that would dampen the role of cyberbullying dynamics on twitter . </S>",
    "<S> we present a discrete - time non - linear compartmental model to explore how the introduction of a quarantine class may help to hinder the spread of offensive messages . </S>",
    "<S> we based the parameters of this model on recent twitter data related to a topic that communities would deem most offensive , and found that for twitter a level of quarantine can always be achieved that will immediately suppress the spread of offensive messages , and that this level of quarantine is independent of the number of offenders spreading the message . </S>",
    "<S> we hope that the analysis of this dynamic model will shed some insights into the viability of new models of methods for reducing cyberbullying in public social networks .    </S>",
