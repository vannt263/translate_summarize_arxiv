    "whereas the ground state properties of strongly interacting fermionic fluids are nowadays well understood , the features of higher - lying excitations such as the roton in he and the plasmon in electron liquids still require further clarification . without a proper consideration of pair excitations , both the dispersion and the damping of these collective modes are described incorrectly . in the bosonic case ,",
    "in particular for the roton in @xmath1he , the introduction of `` backflow '' correlations@xcite ( equivalent to a special case of pair excitations ) has led to a theory@xcite yielding remarkable agreement with experiment .",
    "the correction of the roton position is due to pair fluctuations which have wavelengths comparable to the interparticle distance .    in fermi liquids the density - density response function is conventionally taken to be of the crpa form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the lindhard function and @xmath4 a suitable effective interaction ( also termed , , pseudopotential@xcite  and , , local field@xcite corrected potential  ) .",
    "fixing @xmath4 through the @xmath5 and @xmath6 sum rules leads to a collective mode that is energetically much higher than found in experiments .",
    "one can cure this problem in an _ ad - hoc _ manner by introducing an average effective mass@xcite @xmath7 in @xmath3 .",
    "this is unsatisfactory from the point of view of developing a manifestly microscopic description of the low - temperature properties of 3 , and it also introduces inconsistencies since it violates the above sum rules .",
    "in addition , one would expect that the physical mechanisms that lead to the lowering of the phonon - roton spectrum in 4 from the feynman dispersion law are also at work in 3 . as in 4",
    "the phonon - roton spectrum has been understood quantitatively without the violation of the two above sumrules , our goal is here to develop a theory for 3 that has the same level of accuracy and consistenty as the 4 theory .",
    "the need for such a theory is made even clearer in quasi2dimensional @xmath0he , where the collective mode is found _ inside _ the particle - hole continuum@xcite .",
    "an effective @xmath7 in an rpa formula ( [ eq : chirpa ] ) may lower ( both ! ) the continuum and the collective mode , but only dynamic correlations could reproduce the broadening of the phonon .",
