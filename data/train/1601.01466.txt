    "the w - band lies at an interesting transition between frequencies where galactic emission is dominated by free - free and synchrotron , and frequencies where is dominated by dust ( see : fig . 1 , [ 2 ] ) . in this band ,",
    "the atmosphere is quite transparent , and then we can perform ground - based observations , avoiding the costs , complications and size limitations of balloon - borne and space - based missions .        [",
    "fig : fig1 ]    the measurements of b - modes of cmb polarization would provide the final confirmation of the cosmic inflation hypothesis [ 3 ] . to date this measurement has not been possible for two reasons : the sensitivity of the detectors and the polarized foreground emissions .",
    "the former can be improved with arrays of thousands of independent ultra - sensitive low - temperature detectors .",
    "the latter can be carefully separated from the interesting signal with multi - band experiments , where the w - band plays a key role .",
    "the same is true at smaller angular scales , where the sunyaev zeldovich effect of cmb photons crossing clusters of galaxies allows the study of the intracluster gas and even the use of clusters as cosmology probes [ 4 ] .    in fig .",

    "our cryogenic system is a four - stages cryostat [ 5 ] , composed of a pulse - tube ( pt ) cryocooler , two absorption cryo - pumps ( an @xmath7he and an @xmath8he fridges ) and an @xmath8he@xmath9he dilution refrigerator .",
    "this single - shot cryostat is able to cool the detectors down to 180 mk for 7 hours .",

    "we tested three different detector arrays , consisting of three different types of superconductive film : 40 nm thick al , 80 nm thick al and @xmath10 nm thick ti - al bi - layer .",

    "the critical temperature , @xmath15 , of the film , is linked to the minimum frequency , @xmath16 , able to break cps by @xmath17 since the w - band starts at 75 ghz , @xmath15 has to be lower than 1.03 k.    we measured @xmath15 using the 4-wire reading of the resistance of the feedline at different temperatures , obtaining @xmath18 k and @xmath19 k for aluminum 40 nm and 80 nm thick , respectively .",
    "the uncertainties on the temperature are due to the thermometer calibration , and it is about the 3% of the measure itself .    independent evidence of @xmath15 was obtained by illuminating the chip with a + millimeter - wave source , fig .  [ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "we monitored phase , amplitude and resonant frequency of the resonators while increasing the frequency of the source from 75 to 110 ghz .",
    "the minimum source frequencies producing significant response variations of the resonators are @xmath20 ghz and @xmath21 ghz for aluminum 40 nm and 80 nm thick respectively .",

    "<S> we measured the minimum frequency able to break cps ( i.e. @xmath3 ) obtaining @xmath4 ghz , that corresponds to a critical temperature of 1.31 k. this is not suitable to cover the entire w - band . for an 80 nm layer the minimum frequency decreases to 93.2 ghz , which corresponds to a critical temperature of 1.28 </S>",

    "<S> . further increase of the al film thickness results in bad performance of the detector . </S>",
    "<S> we have thus considered a titanium - aluminum bi - layer ( 10 nm thick ti @xmath5 25 nm thick al , already tested in other laboratories [ 1 ] ) , for which we measured a critical temperature of 820 mk and a cut - on frequency of 65 ghz : so this solution allows operation in the entire w - band . </S>"
