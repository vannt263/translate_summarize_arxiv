    "the x - ray source 4u1909 + 07(or x1908 + 07 ) was detected with the _ uhuru _ satellite @xcite as 3u  1912 + 07 and filed in the fourth _ uhuru _ catalog as 4u1909 + 07@xcite .",
    "it has been seen with most x - ray instruments ever since .",
    "the exact nature of the system was , however , not clear for almost 30 years . in 2000 , @xcite analyzed _",

    "they estimated the mass of the companion star to be @xmath1@xmath2m@xmath3 using a canonical mass of 1.4m@xmath3 for the neutron star and the radius of the companion star to be @xmath4 .",
    "one year later @xcite detected an ob star in the near infrared at the location of the x - ray source , thus confirming that the system is a high mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) .",
    "the distance of the system was estimated to be 7kpc @xcite . prior to this discovery",
    ", @xcite argued that the companion star could be a wolf - rayet star , which would make this system a possible progenitor system to a neutron star - black hole binary .",
    "this possibility , although intriguing , can be ruled out after the discovery of @xcite .",
    "although the system shows no eclipse the x - ray flux is still strongly orbital dependent , as seen in asm data folded onto the orbital period @xcite . @xcite",
    "also analyzed orbital resolved pca spectra and found that around orbital phase 1 the photoabsorption increases dramatically by a factor of at least 3 , explaining the decreased asm flux .",
    "this increase in absorption can be very well described by a spherical wind model and an inclination of @xmath5 , depending on the parameters of the wind model . like most wind - fed hmxb with a neutron star , 4u1909 + 07shows a constant , irregular flaring behavior , superimposed on the regular pulsations .",
    "these flares are most probably due to inhomogeneities in the wind of the donor star , which lead to different accretion rates . in these proceedings",

    "for this analysis we splitted the lightcurve into segments between 300ksec and 800ksec length , providing a good balance between accurate pulse period determination and temporal resolution , and used epoch folding @xcite to determine the pulse period for each of these segments individually .",

    "[ fig : logom_logt ] that the data follow a straight line . superimposed on the plot is a line with slope of 0.5 , shifted in @xmath14-direction to fit the data .",
    "the uncertainties to the data are not only due to uncertainties in the estimate of the pulse period , but are also due to the uneven and coarse sampling . to estimate this effect , we choose a monte carlo approach and simulated many mock - up pulse period evolutions which followed a perfect random walk and sampled these with the same rate as the real data ( see * ? ? ?",

    "but the pulse profile of 4u1909 + 07shows a remarkable and strong energy dependence . to follow this energy dependence of the pulse profile , we extracted pulse profiles from pca data in different energy bands , using a period of @xmath17s and 32 phase bins .",

    "this behavior levels out with increasing energy and the two peaks become more separated ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pp_energy]b ) .",
    "the relative power of the secondary peak keeps declining with increasing energy and is very small compared to the first one at energies around 20kev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pp_energy]c ) .",
    "the deep minimum around phase 0.3 is not energy dependent . for the very high energies we extracted the pulse profile from _",
    "integral_data of the average data of the first 100 days of measurement in 2003 .",
    "we used the same epoch as for the pca analysis , but a period of @xmath18s , as determined in our analysis of the data .",

    "rxte_pulse profiles is continued , and the secondary peak has completely vanished , where as the primary is very clearly seen ( fig .  [",
    "fig : pp_energy]d ) .",
    "the pulse phased averaged spectrum of 4u1909 + 07shows a shape similar to many other neutron star sources , consisting of a powerlaw continuum attenuated by photoabsorption at low energies and by a turnover at high energies .",
    "@xcite modelled the spectrum using a cutoff - powerlaw and a bremsstrahlung model and found that both fit the data equally well .",
    "the turnover at high energies is modeled phenomenologically with different models like ` cutoffpl ` or ` highecut ` , where in the latter the cutoff is only applied after a certain energy @xmath19 .",
    "more sophisticated ones include ` fdcut ` @xcite and ` npex ` @xcite . for our spectral analysis we discarded all observations between orbital phase @xmath20 , where the @xmath21 is dramatically increased @xcite . to this dataset",
    "we fitted the above mentioned models to _ rxte_and _ integral_data simultaneously using xspec 11.3 .",
    "we found that all models give equally good fits regarding the reduced @xmath22 value . in the ` fdcut ` model , however , the cutoff energy is fitted to values @xmath231kev , thus effectively reducing the model to a ` cutoffpl ` .",
    "some of the most important spectral parameters of all other models are shown in tab .",

    "independent of the applied continuum models , a soft excess below 10kev is evident , which can be very well modelled using a blackbody with a temperature of @xmath241.4kev . additionally strong evidence for an iron line close to the energy of neutral iron of 6.4kev",

    "[ fig : phasresparas ] .",
    "it is clearly seen that neither the photoabsorption @xmath21 nor the power law index @xmath25 seems to vary much over the pulse phase .",
    "the strong spectral changes indicated in the energy resolved pulse profiles are thus mainly due to a change in the cutoff energy of the ` cutoffpl ` model .",
    "the cutoff energy is highest in the primary peak , making its spectrum distinctly harder than the rest of the pulse phase . in the secondary pulse",

    "we have presented the first detailed study with _ integral_and _",
    "rxte_of 4u1909 + 07and have shown that the pulse period evolution shows strong indication for a random walk like behavior .",
    "such a behavior has been seen in other hmxb like vela  x-1 and is a strong indicator for a wind accreting source without a persistent accretion disk @xcite . an accretion disk would provide a more constant transfer of angular momentum and thus a long - term spin - up or spin - down trend , as seen in other sources like 4u  1907 + 09 @xcite .",
    "accretion disks form to fulfill the conservation of angular momentum of the accreted wind , but in a system with a strongly magnetized neutron star the ionized matter will couple to the magnetic field lines before a stable disk can form .",
    "this requires field strengths on the order of @xmath28 g , not unusual for this kind of systems . in these strong magnetic fields ,",
    "however , cyclotron resonant scattering features ( crsfs ) should form , as seen in many other sources , e.g. , vela  x-1 @xcite or mxb  0656@xmath29072 @xcite .",
    "we found no evidence for a crsf in 4u1909 + 07 .",
    "as shown by @xcite this does not rule out a strong magnetic field , as crsfs can be filled up again by photon spawning and depend strongly on the geometry of the accretion column and on the viewing angle .",
    "further investigations with high - resolution data will allow a more thorough search for a crsf in 4u1909 + 07 . a strong magnetic field in 4u1909 + 07is also supported by the strongly pulsed flux , as the x - ray flux is believed to be produced in a very small region above the so - called hot - spots on the neutron star surface , where the magnetic field lines penetrate the neutron star surface @xcite .",
    "in the accretion column above the hot - spots the density and temperatures are highest and thus the most x - rays are produced through comptonization of the thermal photons from the thermal mound on the neutron star surface @xcite . if the magnetic axis is not aligned with the rotational axis of the neutron stars , the hot spots and the accretion columns move in and out of sight of the observer , resulting in a pulsed x - ray flux .",
    "the two distinct peaks in the pulse profile at low energies hint at the fact that accretion happens onto both magnetic poles of the neutron star , but under different physical conditions .",
    "the different conditions can explain the different spectra in the two peaks .",
    "the secondary peak shows a distinctly lower cutoff energy which corresponds roughly to the temperature of the electron gas in the accretion column .",
    "a possible explanation could be , e.g. , different sizes of the hot - spots due to misalignment of the magnetic center and the gravitational center of the neutron star .",
    "this would lead to different sizes in the accretion column and thus to different densities and temperatures .",
    "the exact geometry of the accretion column depends strongly on the way the matter couples to the magnetic field and is highly uncertain @xcite .",
    "besides the simple filled funnel other possible configurations include a hollow or a partly hollow funnel . with an average luminosity of @xmath30ergs@xmath31",
    "the system can host accretion rates that are large enough for a shock to form in the accretion column , due to the radiation pressure from the material close to the neutron star surface .",
    "this shock prevents escape of the comptonized photons parallel to the magnetic field lines , so that they can only escape on the sides of the accretion column in a so - called `` fan beam '' @xcite .",
    "if the accretion rate is lower , no shock will form and the radiation can escape along the accretion column in the `` pencil beam '' . which of these two geometries exists in a given object is hard to tell from timing analysis alone , as no independent measurements of the alignment of the magnetic axis is possible .",
    "but phase - resolved spectroscopy can provide some insight into the configuration . for 4u1909 + 07we",
    "have seen that the blackbody component of the spectrum is phase shifted to the two peaks in the pulse profiles .",
    "it is most likely that the blackbody originates from the thermal photons of the thermal mound at the hot spot . through the rotation of the neutron star ,",
    "the hot spot is only visible at certain pulse phases . assuming a hollow funnel accretion geometry , with a large enough accretion rate to form a shock",
    ", we can argue that we view the thermal mound only at the phases were we look along the accretion column , while the most hard x - ray flux is only visible when we see the sides of the accretion column , due to the `` fan beam '' geometry .",
    "caution has to be taken , however , with these models as the behavior of plasma in magnetic fields on the order of @xmath32 g is still only little understood and all models are based on gross simplifications .",
    "additionally gravitational light bending must be taken into account when analyzing pulse profiles and their origin @xcite .",
    "detailed analysis of this kind is ongoing and will be presented in a separate publication .",
