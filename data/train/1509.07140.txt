    "superconductivity appears in iron pnictides when the antiferromagnetic phase is suppressed by chemical doping of the parent compound or by applying pressure.@xcite it is now well known that an isovalent chemical dilution ( e.g. , the partial replacement of as by p , or fe by ru)@xcite presents notable differences with charge doping ( e.g. , by partially replacing o by f in , where r is a rare earth element,@xcite or ba by k in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0)@xcite .",
    "while isovalently - diluted compounds are closer to the clean limit,@xcite charged dopants create strong scattering potentials that affect superconducting properties like the vortex pinning,@xcite the upper critical field,@xcite and even the superconducting gap symmetry.@xcite in fact , many studies indicate that iron - pnictides with charged dopants present a fully gapped fermi surface ( see e.g. , smfeaso@xmath1f@xmath2,@xcite prfeaso@xmath6 @xcite , bafe@xmath7co@xmath2as@xmath0,@xcite ba@xmath1k@xmath2fe@xmath0as@xmath0,@xcite and bafe@xmath7ni@xmath2as@xmath0 @xcite ) , while isovalently substituted compounds like ba(fe@xmath1ru@xmath2)@xmath0as@xmath0 and bafe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0 present evidences of nodes.@xcite it is expected that fluctuation effects around the superconducting transition may also present differences in these two types of iron pnictides.@xcite these effects have been already investigated in presence of charge - doping,@xcite but to our knowledge still remain unexplored in isovalently substituted iron - pnictides .",
    "the main aim of the present work is twofold : on the one hand , we will probe the nature of superconducting fluctuation effects in isovalently - diluted compounds , and the applicability of the existing ginzburg - landau ( gl ) approaches in the different regions of the @xmath8 phase diagram . on the other hand",
    ", these effects will be used to obtain precise information about superconducting parameters like the coherence lengths ( or the upper critical fields ) , the anisotropy factors , and the system dimensionality ( a technique sometimes referred to as _",
    "_ fluctuation spectroscopy__@xcite ) .",
    "fluctuation effects may also provide information about the multiband nature of these materials .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that a two - band model predicts a change in the relative amplitude of different fluctuation observables in relation with the single - band case , mainly through a renormalization of the @xmath9-axis coherence length.@xcite among the isovalently - substituted iron pnictides , bafe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0 with @xmath3 presents the highest critical temperature ( @xmath10  k ) and thus is the best candidate to investigate superconducting fluctuations in these materials . in this work",
    "we present a systematic study of fluctuation effects around @xmath11 in the electrical conductivity and magnetization of several high - quality single crystals of this compound .",
    "the measurements are performed in magnetic fields up to 9  t , which close to @xmath11 is well inside the finite - field ( or prange ) fluctuation regime.@xcite the results will allow to probe the applicability of gl approaches for finite applied magnetic fields , and to investigate possible differences in the coherence length amplitudes associated with the multiband nature of this material .",
    "finally , the low - field ( @xmath12  t ) behavior of the magnetization for temperatures around @xmath11 will be studied to check the relevance of phase fluctuations in bafe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0 , which were claimed to be important in other iron pnictides.@xcite    a ) example of a typical edx spectrum .",

    "some details of their characterization may be seen in ref .  . they are plate - like , with typical surfaces of several mm@xmath17 and thicknesses up to @xmath18  mm .",
    "their stoichiometry was checked with a scanning electron microscope ( zeiss fesem ultra plus ) equipped with a edx ( energy dispersive x - ray ) spectroscope . a typical edx spectrum is shown in fig .  [ edxrx](a ) .",

    "however , there is a significant difference between the corresponding @xmath4 values .",
    "this effect can not be attributed to an incomplete superconducting volume fraction in the stack used for the magnetization measurements , because @xmath5 and @xmath28 ( or @xmath4 ) affect the amplitudes of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , but also their dependence on @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath5 and @xmath4 values in the literature for bafe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0 with @xmath11 values near the maximum one , are summarized in table  [ tableliterature ] .",
    "these data were obtained from the @xmath32 dependence , as probed by dc and ac electrical transport and by a static property like the specific heat .",
    "the @xmath5 values in these works are close to each other and to the values obtained here ( see table  [ tableparameters ] ) .",
    "the @xmath4 value obtained from dc resistivity@xcite is also in excellent agreement with our data obtained from the same observable .",
    "however , a notable difference is found with the @xmath4 values derived from other observables ( 0.9 - 1.75  nm ) .",
    "these results may be somewhat affected by the uncertainty associated to the use of a criterion to determine @xmath32 , but could indicate a possible dependence of @xmath4 on the observable used to determine it",
    ".    our present results may be due to the presence of several bands contributing to the superconductivity in the material under study.@xcite in fact , a recently proposed two - band model predicts that the functional forms of dominating divergences of the fluctuation - induced specific heat and electrical conductivity do not change with respect to the single - band case , but their relative amplitudes are affected mainly by a renormalization of the @xmath9-axis coherence length.@xcite it has been suggested that this effect could be behind a dependence of the upper critical fields of fese@xmath33te@xmath33 on the observable used to determine them . in particular , the @xmath34 values derived from measurements of the specific heat are systematically larger than the ones obtained from the electrical resistivity , and these last are in turn larger than the ones obtained from magnetic torque.@xcite it would be then very interesting to check whether an expression for @xmath35 in a two - band superconductor ( still unavailable ) would also quantitatively account for the differences found here with the data obtained from resistivity measurements .",

    "in contrast with the linear behavior predicted by gaussian gl approaches under low fields ( @xmath39 ) , the @xmath40 isotherms just above @xmath11 present an anomalous upturn at a field @xmath41  t for both field orientations ( see fig .  [ anomaly ] ) .",
    "below @xmath38 the magnetic susceptibility is orders of magnitude larger than the one associated to gaussian superconducting fluctuations . above",
    "@xmath38 the @xmath42 amplitude decreases and , consistently with fig .",
    "[ fluc ] , for fields about @xmath43  t the conventional ggl behavior is recovered .",
    "a qualitatively similar anomalous behavior has been observed in high-@xmath11 cuprates like la@xmath7sr@xmath2cuo@xmath44@xcite and y@xmath1ca@xmath2ba@xmath0cu@xmath16o@xmath45,@xcite and more recently in fe - based superconductors like smfeaso@xmath1f@xmath2 ( sm1111 ) @xcite and ba(fe@xmath1rh@xmath2)@xmath0as@xmath0 ( rh122)@xcite . the similarities between our results and these previous works in iron pnictides are even quantitative . for instance ,",
    "the isotherms measured at temperatures near @xmath11 present very similar @xmath38 and @xmath46 values ( in the case of sm1111 one has to take into account its 2d nature and that the sample is granular ) .",
    "so , to a large extent the effect in bafe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0 has the same origin than in rh122 and sm1111 . in refs .",
    "and it has been proposed that , like in the htsc , the anomaly is due to the presence of important phase fluctuations .",
    "alternatively , it has been proposed that it is a consequence of a @xmath11 distribution , which in cuprate or fe - based superconductors would be associated to their non - stoichiometric nature.@xcite in the case of bafe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0 some indications support this last explanation : on the one side , below @xmath38 the magnetic susceptibility is a significant fraction of the perfect diamagnetism ( indicated as a dashed line in fig .  [ anomaly ] ) , as if a significant volume fraction of the sample were actually in the meissner region .",
    "on the other , the effect is limited to a range of temperatures above @xmath11 of the order of the transition width .",
    "finally , the @xmath38 value at the average @xmath11 is consistent with the lower critical field of the highest-@xmath11 domains , which may be approximated by @xmath47 , and that is in the @xmath48  t range.@xcite    an argument supporting the possible presence of phase fluctuations in sm1111 and rh122 is that @xmath38 increases with the temperature above @xmath11 , while the lower critical field decreases.@xcite such an @xmath38 increase with @xmath49 is not observed in bafe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0 ( see inset in fig .  [ anomaly ] ) , in spite that the transition width of our sample is comparable or even smaller ( in relative terms ) than those in refs .   and . as a consequence",
    ", we may assume that phase fluctuations do not play a role in this compound , or at least they are much less relevant than in sm1111 and rh122 .",
    "we have presented measurements of the magnetization and electrical resistivity around the superconducting transition of the isovalently - substituted iron pnictide bafe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0 with @xmath3 , near the optimal ( maximum-@xmath11 ) value .",
    "the measurements were performed with magnetic fields up to 9  t in the conductivity and 6  t in the magnetization , in both cases applied in the two main crystal directions ( parallel and perpendicular to the @xmath13 layers ) . due to the relatively large normal - state electrical conductivity near @xmath11 ,",
    "the fluctuation effects in this observable are almost unobservable . as a consequence ,",
    "the resistive transitions are very well defined , allowing to determine with accuracy the temperature dependence of the parallel and perpendicular upper critical fields , and the in - plane @xmath5 and out - of - plane @xmath4 coherence lengths . on the contrary",
    ", the magnetization presents an appreciable diamagnetic contribution just above @xmath11 that may be attributed to superconducting fluctuations .",
    "these data were consistently analyzed in the different fluctuation regimes ( gaussian and critical ) in terms of existing ginzburg - landau approaches for single - band superconductors .",
    "while the resulting @xmath5 is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the field dependence of the resistive transition , @xmath4 is significantly larger ( @xmath50% ) .",
    "a dependence of the coherence lengths with the observable used to determine them was also found in other fe - based superconductors.@xcite recent theoretical approaches show that the presence of several bands contributing to the superconductivity affects the fluctuation effects mainly through a renormalization of the @xmath9-axis coherence length.@xcite thus , we suggest that our present results could be a consequence of the multiband nature of the compound under study . an expression for the fluctuation magnetization in two - band superconductors would be desirable to confirm this proposal . finally ,",
    "from the analysis of the anomalous upturn in the @xmath51 isotherms just above @xmath11 , we find that phase fluctuations may play a negligible role in this compound , contrary to what is proposed for other fe - based superconductors.@xcite    this work was supported by the xunta de galicia ( grant no .",
