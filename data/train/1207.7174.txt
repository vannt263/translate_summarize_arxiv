    "equilibrium canonical distribution is a fundamental result in statistical mechanics , but with an implicit assumption that the system - bath coupling ( sbc ) is vanishingly weak . in real physical situations , such as light - harvesting systems",

    "then a good separation between the system and the bath is lost , leading to non - canonical equilibrium statistics for the system ( though the system plus the bath as a whole still satisfies a canonical distribution ) . at present non - canonical statistics",
    "is a subject of great interest .",
    "it challenges intuitive concepts in statistical mechanics @xcite and brings about new understandings of open quantum systems . because canonical statistics can be recovered in the classical limit for a wide class of microscopic open - system models @xcite",
    ", non - canonical statistics can also serve as an indicator of the quantumness of open systems .    to better understand non - canonical statistics and for future bench - marking purposes",
    ", an analytical treatment of non - canonical statistics at arbitrary temperature and also for the whole range of sbc strength is important .",
    "this task is achieved here in a spin - boson model by exploiting both the polaron transformation technique and perturbation theory , with results applicable to almost the entire parameter space ( certain conditions to be elaborated below ) .",
    "though our theory does provide all the information of system s reduced density matrix ( rdm ) , one simple measure is employed to quantify the degree of non - canonical statistics .",
    "specifically , we use the angle by which the diagonal representation of rdm is rotated away from the energy eigen - representation of the system as the measure .",
    "evidently , this angle is zero for a canonical distribution because the associated rdm is diagonal in energy basis states .",
    "it is then shown how an increasing sbc strength or a decreasing temperature strengthens non - canonical statistics .",
    "interestingly , at sufficiently high temperature , our theory reveals that the standard canonical statistics will be recovered asymptotically .",
    "the theoretical results are found to be in full agreement with exact monte - carlo simulations .",
    "the observation that non - canonical statistics vanishes in the high temperature regime resonates with the view that non - canonical statistics reflects the quantumness of the open system , which is expected to diminish at high temperature .",
    "furthermore , we exploit our simple non - canonical statistics measure to identify an interesting temperature scale , at which the non - canonical equilibrium statistics is most sensitive to temperature variations .",
    "the total hamiltonian @xmath0 of a system plus a bath is written as @xmath1 where the three terms represent hamiltonians of the system , the bath , and sbc , respectively .",
    "the system and the bath as a whole is assumed to be in contact with a super - reservoir at temperature @xmath2 .",
    "long after quantum relaxation takes place , the system and the bath as a whole reaches a canonical equilibrium state @xmath3 .",
    "the equilibrium rdm of the system is given by  @xcite @xmath4 = \\frac{\\mbox{tr}_b[\\mbox{e}^{-\\beta h_t}]}{\\mbox{tr}[\\mbox{e}^{-\\beta h_t } ] } , \\label{eqn : rdm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 , @xmath6 $ ] denotes the trace over the system as well as the bath , and @xmath7 $ ] denotes the trace over the bath only .",
    "due to the non - vanishing contribution of @xmath8 to @xmath0 , in general the equilibrium rdm is no longer a canonical distribution of the system alone  @xcite .",
    "it is hence of importance to develop a theoretical treatment to systematically investigate the dependence of @xmath9 upon temperature @xmath2 and the magnitude of @xmath8 .",
    "we achieve this task here for a spin - boson model with the hamiltonian ( we set @xmath10 ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) are the usual pauli matrices , @xmath14 is the energy splitting between two levels of the system , and @xmath15 is the tunneling matrix element .",
    "the bath is modeled as a set of harmonic oscillators with frequencies @xmath16 , and the couplings to the spin system are denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "the properties of the bath are fully characterized by its spectral density , namely , @xmath18 . for a fully analytical development",

    "this roughly explains how our polaron - picture - based perturbation theory , by construction , may be suitable for treating finite sbc strength .",
    "it is now also clear that our theory is perturbative in terms of @xmath36 , but non - perturbative in terms of @xmath8 .",

    "( [ second - order - state ] ) is complicated , it involves @xmath75 matrices only .",

    "so by construction , our perturbation theory for off - diagonal elements of rdm works even better for stronger sbc coupling ( thus analogous to the previous treatment for @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) .",
    "with all the rdm elements analytically obtained above , we now examine the validity of our theoretical results and reveal interesting physics in non - canonical equilibrium statistics . instead of examining all the rdm elements ( one exception later ) , we use a single quantity to characterize non - canonical statistics , i.e. , the smallest possible angle ( @xmath88 ) to be rotated ( in radians ) on the bloch sphere to reach the eigenstates of @xmath89 from the diagonal representation of the rdm . the theoretical results ( solid line )",

    "it is in this special representation that decoherence can be understood as the disappearance of the off - diagonal matrix elements of a time - evolving rdm .",

    "this very feature shared by the equilibrium rdm considered here and the preferred basis of decoherence is somewhat expected : an equilibrium rdm is an asymptotic result of quantum dissipation . due to this interesting connection",

[",

    "a systematic approach to such open quantum systems is hence highly desirable in efforts to better understand their qualitative and quantitative features of equilibrium statistics as temperature and/or sbc strength varies . to our knowledge , the theoretical treatment advocated in this work , as supported by numerical results , represents the first attempt along this direction that can almost cover the whole range of sbc strength and the whole range of temperature of a spin - boson model .",
    "because non - canonical statistics is closely related to strong system - bath correlation , we anticipate our theory to be also useful in understanding system - bath entanglement .",
