    "recent astrophysical observations of gamma - rays spectra of distant blazars  @xcite strongly indicate the presence of large - scale magnetic fields in cosmic voids .",
    "together with the ubiquitous presence of large - scale , coherent magnetic fields in clusters of galaxies and the magnetization of galaxies at both low and high redshifts , this fact strongly points toward ( @xmath6 ) the existence of a `` cosmic magnetic field '' that pervades the entire observable universe , ( @xmath11 ) that its origin is primordial ( namely , it took place before large - scale structures formation ) , and ( @xmath14 ) it is a relic of inflation ( for reviews on primordial magnetic fields , see  @xcite ) .    however ,",
    "because of the conformal invariance of classical maxwell electromagnetism in a friedmann - robertson - walker background , photons can not be created during inflation , as a consequence of the `` parker theorem ''  @xcite .",
    "quantum effects , nevertheless , can break such a conformal invariance allowing for a generation of strong magnetic fields  @xcite , or electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations can either survive and be amplified in marginally open universes  @xcite , or be `` boosted '' by gravitational waves  @xcite .",
    "another possibility to create seed magnetic fields during inflation is to consider nonstandard , nonconformal - invariant electromagnetic theories . starting from the seminal papers by turner and widrow  @xcite , who studied nonconformal couplings between photons and gravity , and by ratra  @xcite , who considered a conformal - breaking coupling between the inflaton and the electromagnetic field , there have been many attempts in this direction ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    after the work  @xcite ,",
    "all these attempts in constructing models of inflationary magnetogenesis have been believed to be untrustful because of the so - called `` strong coupling problem '' and `` backreaction problem , '' and efforts have been made in constructing successful scenarios in which both problems are avoided  @xcite .",
    "recently enough  @xcite , however , we have stressed the fact that there is a flaw in the arguments of  @xcite and in the proposed nonstandard magnetogenesis mechanisms . there , in fact , it is assumed that , after reheating , postinflationary electric currents froze inflation - produced superhorizon magnetic fields . but",
    "this implies a violation of causality since , as first pointed out in  @xcite , postinflationary currents are generated by microphysical processes during reheating and , then , are vanishing on superhorizon scales .",
    "fixing the `` causality flaw '' in the ratra model by studying the creation of photons out from the vacuum _ via _ the `` parker mechanism ''  @xcite , we have found that the ratra model is a viable , and indeed successful , scenario of inflationary magnetogenesis .",
    "the implications for cosmic magnetogenesis of having vanishing superhorizon electric currents have been investigated by tsagas  @xcite .",
    "he analyzed the case of free maxwell theory in flat , marginally open , and marginally closed universes , and a particular case of nonstandard electromagnetism , the one where magnetic fields during inflation evolve as a power of the expansion parameter , @xmath18 with @xmath19 ( the latter case has been further developed in  @xcite ) .",
    "the result is that , in general , superhorizon magnetic fields do not evolve adiabatically after reheating .",
    "the aim of this paper is threefold .",
    "first , we will show that quantum magnetic fluctuations in maxwell theory evolve adiabatically in a spatially flat universe once the bunch - davies vacuum is chosen to be the physical vacuum state .",
    "second , we will generalize the results in  @xcite by studying the postinflationary evolution of superhorizon magnetic fields in a general nonconformal - invariant electromagnetic theory .",
    "third , we will show that inflation - produced , superhorizon magnetic fields are superadiabatically amplified after inflation in the ratra model , thus supporting our recent claim that the ratra model evades both the backreaction and strong - coupling problems .",
    "in this section , we analyze the evolution of magnetic fields in free maxwell theory .",
    "we use two equivalent approaches , the `` photon wave function '' and the `` magnetic flux '' approaches .",
    "these will also be used in the next section when we study the case of nonconformal - invariant theories .",
    "while the first approach is , in our opinion , more direct , the second one is useful when comparing our results with those of  @xcite .",
    "let us consider the free maxwell theory described by the lagrangian @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the photon field .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the case of a spatially flat , friedmann - robertson - walker universe , described by the line element @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the conformal time and @xmath25 is the expansion parameter , which we normalize to unity at the present time @xmath26 . working in the coulomb gauge , @xmath27 , we quantize the electromagnetic field by expanding it , in the fock space , as @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the comoving wave number , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are the standard circular polarization vectors .",
    "the annihilation and creation operators @xmath33 and @xmath34 satisfy the usual commutation relations @xmath35 = ( 2\\pi)^3 \\delta_{\\alpha \\alpha ' } \\delta({\\mathbf{k}}-{\\mathbf{k}}')$ ] , all the other commutators being null . in order to get the usual commutation relations for the electromagnetic field and its canonical conjugate momentum , one must impose the wronskian condition @xmath36 on the wave functions of the two photon polarization states @xmath37 .",
    "( hereafter , a prime indicates a differentiation with respect to the conformal time . ) finally , the vacuum state @xmath38 is defined by @xmath39 for all @xmath30 and @xmath40 and normalized as @xmath41 .",
    "the photon wave functions satisfy the usual free harmonic oscillator equation , @xmath42 whose solution is @xmath43 here , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are integration constants which are fixed by the choice of the vacuum .",
    "the wronskian condition implies that @xmath46 @xmath47 accordingly , the photon wave functions , in free maxwell theory , are the usual plane waves @xmath48 let us now introduce the magnetic field as usual as @xmath49 .",
    "the observable quantity is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the squared magnetic field operator . using eq .",

    "the introduction of the conductivity does not change this result .",
    "in fact , its only effect , due to his huge value in the early universe , is to force subhorizon magnetic fields to evolve adiabatically after reheating .",

    "the large - scale magnetic fields we observe today in galaxies , clusters of galaxies , and cosmic voids are probably relics from inflation , and a possible explanation for them is the creation of photons out from the vacuum through the parker mechanism in a putative ( nonstandard ) , nonconformal - invariant theory of electrodynamics .    for long time since the first model of inflationary magnetogenesis by turner and widrow  @xcite , it has been assumed that inflation - produced magnetic fields remain frozen after reheating on superhorizon scales ( which are the scales of astrophysical interest for cosmic magnetic fields ) due to the high conductivity of the primeval plasma , so that they evolve adiabatically .",

    ", @xmath0 is the magnetic wave number , @xmath4 is the conformal time at the end of inflation , @xmath2 is the number density spectrum of photons produced out of the vacuum by inflation _ via _ the parker mechanism and , finally , @xmath3 is the phase difference between the two bogolubov coefficients which define the state of the electromagnetic mode @xmath0 at the end of inflation .    for generic models of inflation",
    ", we have found that the relation @xmath5 holds in any model of inflationary magnetogenesis which may eventually explain the presence of cosmic magnetic fields .",
    "this , in turn , leaves open only three possibilities for the evolution of superhorizon magnetic fields after inflation : ( @xmath6 ) @xmath7 , in which case the evolution is adiabatic , namely the magnetic flux spectrum @xmath107 is constant in time ; ( @xmath11 ) @xmath12 , in which case the evolution is superadiabatic , in the sense that the magnetic flux increases in time , in particular as @xmath13 ; ( @xmath14 ) @xmath15 or @xmath16 , in which case the evolution is adiabatic up the time @xmath17 and then superadiabatic afterwards , with @xmath13 . in all cases ,",
