    "moreover , even though massive gravity can qualitatively explain either dark energy and dark matter by tuning the gravitational force at long and intermediate distances  @xcite , the presence of black hole energy density might be a fundamental ingredient to fit the data .    as a last remark",

    "@xcite by means of wald s formula @xcite .",
    "hence , the euclidean action reduces to the free energy in the semiclassical approximation , i.e.  @xmath140 with @xmath141 , so that the first law of black hole thermodynamics is recovered by requiring @xmath142 to have a minimum .",

    "such a universal behavior is remarkable , knowing that the euclidean action is different .",
    "in some sense , the phase structure for @xmath65 and @xmath124 looks like the one for @xmath61 ( left panel of fig .",

    "[ fig:5 ] ) the phase structure is different : no phase is allowed at low temperature ( @xmath153 in the example ) .",
    "a possible explanation of this result might be that at low temperature the existing phase is a state that has scalar charge and no event horizon .",

    "on the other hand , one might guess that this peculiarity arises because we are assuming that @xmath1 is conserved . in the next section ,",
    "we assume other boundary conditions where the scalar charge is allowed to vary inside the cavity .",
    "in principle , one can assume the scalar charge not to be conserved inside the cavity .",
    "in such a case the phase evolution is no longer constrained by the initial value of @xmath1 but by the value of @xmath154 , the scalar - charge  potential \" at the surface of the cavity . in this ensemble",
    "it is straightforward to see that the euclidean action compatible with the regularity condition is given by @xmath155 where @xmath156~. \\label{eq : phi}\\ ] ] one may prove that the present ensemble is always dominated by a configuration with a negative heat capacity and is therefore ill - defined , as we shortly see now .    by combining eqs .   and",
    ", @xmath95 can be expressed as function of @xmath58 and @xmath154 .",
    "this relation can be more conveniently rewritten as    @xmath157    where @xmath113 , @xmath115 and @xmath158 .",
    "the behavior of the solution is plotted in fig .  [ fig:6 ] ( solid lines ) for several values of @xmath154 . the scalar charge changes along the curve and it is positive ( negative ) when the solution is below ( above ) the dashed line . the radius at which this cross occurs is marked as @xmath159 in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ( top panels , the left plot being for @xmath160 and the right one for @xmath161 ) . furthermore ,",
    "when @xmath161 , the black hole event horizon radius is bounded from above by the extremal case limit and can never reach the spherical cavity ( see appendix for some analytic results ) .",
    "the behavior of @xmath116 described above seems problematic since the positiveness of the heat capacity depends on the sign of the slope of @xmath116 . for a positive slope , as in the case here",
    ", the heat capacity is negative . as we have discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : local ] , this necessarily implies a divergent integral for the partition function , i.e.  the partition function in the saddle point approximation is not well - defined and produces an imaginary result .",
    "this may be interpreted as the effect of an unidentified metastable phase .",
    "however , the present framework does not offer an unambiguous description and such interpretation should be taken with precaution .",
    "lorentz breaking massive gravity is an interesting theory that may explain the recent acceleration of the universe without invoking dark energy .",
    "it also provides peculiar black hole solutions due to the presence of hair parameters that modifies the standard gravitational potential . in this theory the analog of the schwarzschild black hole  the asymptotically flat spherically symmetric solution  depends on two parameters : the mass and the `` scalar charge '' ( characterizing the hair strength ) . in this paper",
    "we have analyzed equilibrium states and phase structures of such a solution enclosed in a spherical surface kept at a fixed temperature .",
    "we have proven that when the scalar charge inside the cavity is not conserved , the ensemble is ill - defined . on the contrary ,",
    "when the scalar charge is held fixed , the saddle point approximation can be applied to obtain the partition function @xmath162 , where @xmath28 is the regularized on - shell euclidean action . with that formalism",
    "we were able to study the black hole thermodynamics and phase structure .",
    "in particular , the black hole entropy follows the bekenstein - hawking formula .",
    "depending on the value of the scalar charge @xmath1 contained in the cavity , the phase structure presents completely different behaviors that can be summarized as follows ( being @xmath163 a critical value of the scalar charge ) :    * _ @xmath164 : _ above a certain temperature there exist two black hole solutions with different event horizon radii .",
    "the smaller black hole is unstable while the larger is globally stable and describes the phase present in the cavity .",
    "below that temperature we do not find any solution with event horizon , probably because the analysis is not suitable for this phase . * _ @xmath61 : _ below a certain temperature no black hole solution exists and the phase consists of the usual globally - flat background of massive gravity .",
    "above that temperature the previous phase competes with a new phase consisting of a large black hole . * _ @xmath165 : _ there is an interval of temperatures where there are three black holes solutions with different sizes of event horizon .",
    "the smallest and the largest are locally stable and therefore correspond to local minima of the free energy , but the intermediate is unstable as it corresponds to a maximum of the free energy .",
    "hence , a tunnelling between the two stable phases may occur and this first order phase transition is forced to happen when the temperature crosses the whole interval . * _ @xmath166 : _ only one black hole solution is allowed at each temperature . at a certain temperature a second - order phase transition happens and at this moment the critical exponent of the heat capacity is @xmath167 . * _ @xmath168 : _ there is a single ( both globally and locally ) stable black hole at every temperature .",
    "further investigations on the cases with negative @xmath1 are worthwhile . indeed , their isomorphism to reisser - nordstrom black holes in ads , ds and flat space in the canonical ensemble @xcite is peculiar , knowing that their euclidean actions are different .",
    "furthermore , at low temperature the globally stable configurations are small cold black holes .",
    "these objects overcome most of the astrophysical constraints  @xcite and , in principle , might be the dark matter candidates of massive gravity .",
    "dedicated dark matter analyses would be needed to check this possibility but , as a first step , one should understand whether the black hole scalar charge is actually conserved ( or at least varies very slow ) in nature . in order to address this question one should probably comprehend the origin of the modified character of black hole horizons @xcite , which is hard to understand without a known uv completion of the theory .",
    "however , with the use of the ads / cft correspondence one may attempt to study such problems @xcite . in that context , the study of the phase structure may play an important role as a valuable test of the ads / cft correspondence . since the phase structure emerging for ads boundary conditions appears as well as for asymptotically - de sitter black holes and asymptotically - flat black holes in cavities  @xcite , one should expect the cft side to have a rich variety of phases ( such as deconfinement / confinement ) dual to what has been studied in this paper .",
    "moreover , lorentz symmetry violation should arise in the cft side  @xcite . trying to understand regimes in which lorentz violation is sizeable",
    "will hopefully allow us to devise the right experimental tests to decide whether massive gravity is or is not realized in nature .",
    "we are grateful to p.  tinyakov for stimulating discussions and useful advices .",
    "the work of f.c . is supported in part by the iisn , belgian science policy ( under contract iap v/27 ) and by the  action de recherche concerts \" ( arc ) , project  beyond einstein : fundamental aspects of gravitational interactions \" .",
    "in this appendix , we consider the case @xmath128 .",
    "this particular choice allows us to determine the main feature of the general case by some analytic calculations . in appendix  [ app:1 ]",
    "we focus on the ensemble with fixed scalar charge @xmath169 and in appendix  [ app:2 ] we determine the behavior of @xmath116 for the ensemble with fixed scalar charge potential .      for negative values of the scalar charge the function @xmath116 has two extrema ( see left panel of fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) : one maximum and one minimum .",
    "the location of such extrema is obtained by solving the equation @xmath170 the critical scalar charge is obtained when both extrema are degenerate , i.e. when the discriminant of the polynomial equation is vanishing . by performing the explicit computation , the discriminant of the equation takes the form : @xmath171 where @xmath172 are real and positive constants . therefore , several values for @xmath118 are allowed for a vanishing discriminant . however",
    ", only one value of @xmath118 corresponds to a positive event horizon radius : @xmath173 by replacing the critical value of the scalar charge in eq .",
    ", we obtain the critical value of the event horizon radius : @xmath174 by substituting both @xmath175 and @xmath176 in @xmath116 , we have the critical inverse temperature @xmath177 we note that such critical values are similar to the reissner - nordstrom case @xcite . at @xmath148",
    ", we can expand @xmath116 around the critical point @xmath175 : @xmath178 the second derivative of @xmath116 vanishes , when evaluated at the critical point . from here , one can very easily obtain the behavior of the entropy and heat capacity near the critical temperature : @xmath179 as we have already mentioned in sect .",
    "[ sec : global ] , the critical exponent for the heat capacity has the same value @xmath167 as for reissner - nordstrom black holes in ads , ds and flat space in a cavity at fixed electric charge @xcite .",
    "this implies that at the critical value of the scalar charge , we have a second order phase transition .",
    "moreover , this conclusion is independent of the value of @xmath47 since the point @xmath175 is a stationary point of inflection as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .        * for @xmath180 : the extremal black hole limit is not allowed inside the cavity and the event horizon radius can therefore take all the possible values inside the cavity , i.e. @xmath181 . at some temperature , the black hole engulfs the cavity . * for @xmath182 :",
    "the black hole event horizon is bounded from above by the extremal black hole limit that takes place at @xmath183 .",
    "therefore , at very low temperatures the ensemble is dominated by nearly extremal black holes . in such a case , the black hole can never reach the cavity wall .    in both situations , depending on the value of the event horizon radius",
    ", we can have positive or negative scalar charge configurations .",
    "the change of sign of @xmath118 takes place at @xmath184 which is the value where the scalar charge vanishes , turning the hairy black hole into the conventional schwarzschild black hole .",
    "positive scalar charge configurations are in the domain where @xmath185 , implying therefore that black holes with negative scalar charge have @xmath186 .",
