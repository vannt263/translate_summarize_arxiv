    "the parkes multibeam pulsar survey is a large - scale survey of the southern galactic plane from @xmath1 to @xmath2 and with @xmath5 using the parkes 64-m radio telescope and the multibeam receiver .",
    "this receiver has 13 beams arranged in a hexagonal pattern , each with dual linear polarization and a bandwidth of 288 mhz centered on 1374 mhz .",
    "the average system temperature is about 21  k , corresponding to a system - equivalent flux density of about 30 jy .",
    "signals from each polarization of each beam are filtered to give 96 3-mhz channels , the outputs of which are summed in polarization pairs , high - pass filtered , integrated and one - bit digitized at intervals of 250 @xmath6s .",
    "the observation time per pointing is 35 min . using clusters of workstations at the various collaborating institutions",
    ", data are dedispersed with up to 325 trial dispersion measures ( dms ) and searched for periodic signals . for low - dm pulsars with periods in the range 10",
    "ms to 5 s , the limiting sensitivity of the survey is about 0.2 mjy .",
    "the survey commenced in mid-1997 and approximately 95% of the 2670 pointings required to complete it have been observed .",
    "most of the data have been processed , resulting in the discovery of 608 pulsars , including eight binary pulsars and four millisecond pulsars .",
    "the survey and discovery of the first 100 pulsars are described in some detail by manchester et al .",
    "other papers announcing discoveries of special interest are referenced in that paper .",
    "as shown in fig .  [ fg : ppdot ] , the parkes multibeam survey has been especially successful in discovering young and highly magnetized pulsars . in fact",
    ", the five radio pulsars with the highest known surface dipole magnetic fields were all discovered in this survey .",
    "of the 608 new pulsars , 37 have characteristic ages @xmath7 kyr , a much higher proportion of young pulsars compared to previous surveys . surprisingly , about one third of these apparently young pulsars , including the youngest , psr j1119@xmath86127 ( camilo et al . 2000 ) , have periods of more than 400 ms , with five exceeding 1 s. a preliminary ` pulsar current ' analysis ( cf .",
    "lorimer et al .",
    "1993 ) assuming a simple disk galaxy and a beaming factor of five gives a birthrate of about one pulsar every 180 years , consistent with earlier estimates .",
    "with so many newly discovered young pulsars , it is obvious that a search for associated supernova remnants ( snrs ) is likely to be worthwhile . following the recognition that psr j1119@xmath86127 is a very young pulsar , a search of the molonglo galactic plane survey ( mgps ; green et al .",
    "1999 ) showed a faint ring of emission centered on the pulsar .",
    "radio observations with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) ( crawford et al . 2001 ) and x - ray observations with asca ( pivovaroff et al .",
    "2001 ) confirmed this association .",
    "we have used the atca and the mgps to search for possible snrs around the remaining 15 multibeam pulsars with ages less than 50 kyr .",
    "no data are available for psrs j0729@xmath81448 and j1837@xmath80604 , both with ages of about 35 kyr , and there was no obvious association for psrs j1702@xmath84310 ( 17 kyr ) , j1112@xmath86103 ( 33 kyr ) , j1015@xmath85719 ( 39 kyr ) , j1637@xmath84642 ( 41 kyr ) and j0940@xmath85428 ( 42 kyr ) .",
    "the remaining eight young pulsars , along with psr j1119@xmath86127 , are listed in table  [ tb : assoc ]",
    ". this table lists pulsar periods and characteristic ages , the best estimate of the pulsar distance , in most cases derived from the dm using the taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) galactic electron density model , the possibly associated snr , its apparent radius , the ratio of the pulsar radial distance from the apparent center of the snr to the snr radius ( @xmath9 ) and the status of the association .",

    "the pulsar lies well outside the remnant and normally would not be considered a likely association .",

    "psr j1413@xmath86141 lies on this bridge of emission , approximately midway between the two bright regions .",

    "1999 ) and psr b1338@xmath862/g308.8@xmath80.1 ( kaspi et al . 1992 ) and suggests that collimated winds from the pulsar may be responsible for the bright regions .",

    "the pulsar is located right at the center of a beautiful shell having bilateral symmetry .",
    "this shell , previously uncatalogued , has been named g352.2@xmath80.1 .",
    "its morphology and relation to the pulsar strongly suggest that it is an snr associated with the pulsar . assuming it has the age and distance of the pulsar , its expansion velocity is a very reasonable 1100 km s@xmath14 .",

    "although the region is complex , we believe that this shell source is likely to be an snr associated with the pulsar . the implied velocity of the pulsar ( 250 km s@xmath14 ) and of the shell ( 1700 km s@xmath14 ) are both reasonable .",
