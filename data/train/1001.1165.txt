    "<S> thus the tee in @xmath107 is @xmath72 independent , which is a generic property of the string - net models@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath72 dependence of @xmath108 in the abelian and non - abelian phases has qualitative difference due to their different entanglement spectra . </S>",
    "<S> if we define @xmath111 , the quantity @xmath112 is the same as the free energy of a thermal system with hamiltonian @xmath113 and temperature @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the low energy spectrum of @xmath113 can be obtained from the following quantity : c_e(t)=-t,[ecapacity ] which is termed as  _ capacity of entanglement _ \" and is the analog of heat capacity @xmath115 in a thermal system . </S>",
    "<S> the explicit expression of @xmath116 and @xmath117 is given in the supplementary material , which leads to the numerical results shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : renyi ] . as expected , in the limit of @xmath118 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath117 vanishes exponentially for abelian phase but linearly for non - abelian phase , since the latter has a gapless entanglement spectrum with constant density of state . </S>",
    "<S> more generically , if the entanglement hamiltonian @xmath113 describes a @xmath119 dimensional conformal field theory ( cft ) in long wavelength limit @xcite , the capacity of entanglement is given by @xmath120 for @xmath118 , with @xmath121 the length of the boundary , and @xmath20 and @xmath122 the central charge and velocity of the cft , respectively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , if @xmath113 describes a critical theory with dynamical exponent @xmath123 , from dimensional analysis one can obtain the asymptotic behavior @xmath124 for @xmath118 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we see that the capacity of entanglement characterizes some important qualitative behavior of the entanglement spectrum in generic systems .    </S>",
