    "we present the uncertainty discussion of a recent experiment performed at the gsi ( darmstadt , germany ) for the accurate energy measurement of the he - like uranium @xmath0 intra - shell transition .",
    "this measurement allows , for the first time , to test two - photons quantum electrodynamics in he - like heavy ions . in this article",
    "we describe the techniques adopted in the measurement where x rays emitted from fast ions in a storage ring have been detected with a bragg spectrometer . in particular , we study the contribution of the different uncertainties related to the relativistic velocity of the ions when a stationary or moving calibration x - ray source is considered .",
    "additional details of such an experiment can be found in ref .",
    "the experiment was performed at the gsi experimental storage ring esr @xcite in august 2007 . here",
    ", a h - like uranium beam with up to @xmath3 ions was stored , cooled , and decelerated to an energy of 43.57 mev / u .",
    "excited he - like ions were formed by electron capture during the interaction of the ion beam with a supersonic nitrogen gas - jet target . at the selected velocity ,",
    "electrons are primarily captured into shells with principal quantum number of @xmath4 , which efficiently populate the @xmath5 @xmath6 state via cascade feeding .",
    "this state decays to the @xmath5 @xmath7 state via an electric dipole ( e1 ) intra - shell transition ( branching ration 30% ) with the emission of photons of an energy close to 4.51  kev detected by a bragg spectrometer .    the crystal spectrometer @xcite was mounted in the johann geometry in a fixed angle configuration allowing for the detection of x rays with a bragg angle @xmath8 around @xmath9 .",
    "the spectrometer was equipped with a ge(220 ) crystal cylindrically bent , with a radius of curvature @xmath10  mm , and a newly fitted x - ray ccd camera ( andor do420 ) as position sensitive detector .",
    "the imaging properties of the curved crystal were used to resolve spectral lines from fast x - ray sources nearly as well as for stationary sources @xcite . for this purpose , it was necessary to place the rowland - circle plane of the spectrometer perpendicular to the ion  beam direction . for a minimizing the systematic effects due to the ion velocity and alignment uncertainties ,",
    "the observation angle @xmath11 was chosen .",
    "the value of the ion velocity @xmath12 was selected such that the photon energy , @xmath13 in the ion frame , was doppler - shifted to the value @xmath14  kev in the laboratory frame , where @xmath15 $ ] , with @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is speed of light ) and @xmath18 .",
    "this value of @xmath19 was chosen to have the he - like uranium spectral line position on the ccd close to the position of the 8.6 kev @xmath20 lines of zinc , which were observed in second order diffraction .",
    "the zinc lines were used for calibration and they were produced by a commercial x - ray tube and a removable zinc plate between the target chamber and the crystal .",
    "an image of the zinc @xmath1 lines from the bragg spectrometer is presented in fig .",
    "[ 2d ] ( left side ) .    as an alternative method to the measurement of the he - like uranium intra - shell transition",
    ", we used a calibration line originating from fast ions , rather than one from the stationary source . for this purpose the @xmath2 transition in li - like u at @xmath21  ev @xcite was chosen . at the esr , the li - like ions were obtained by electron capture into he - like uranium ions . to match the energy of the he - like transition , an energy of 32.63 mev / u",
    "was used to doppler - shift the li - like transition .",
    "an image of the li - like uranium transition in the bragg spectrometer is presented in fig .",
    "[ 2d ] ( right side ) .",
    "starting from the bragg s law in differential form , @xmath22 , one obtains an approximate dispersion formula that is valid for small bragg angle differences @xmath23 . taking into account the relativistic doppler effect , the measured value of the he - like u transition is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the diffraction order of the he - like u and reference lines , respectively , @xmath27 and @xmath28 the correspondent bragg angle , @xmath29 is the position difference of the spectral lines on the ccd along the dispersion direction and @xmath30 is the crystal ",
    "ccd distance .",
    "@xmath31 is the deviation of the index of refraction @xmath32 of the crystal material from the unity , which depends on the energy @xmath13 of the reflected x ray ( @xmath33 typically ) .    in the case",
    "@xmath34 , the corrections due to the refraction index and other energy dependent corrections for curved crystals @xcite are negligible . in the case of a stationary calibration source , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the measured value of the he - like uranium transition energy and additional information can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the following section we present in detail the analysis of the systematic uncertainties .",
    "one of the main sources of uncertainty in the present experiment is the low amount of collected data ( see fig .",
    "[ 2d ] , right ) .",
    "this limits the accuracy of the he- and li - like uranium line position , i.e. , the accuracy of @xmath29 , which is proportional to the energy uncertainty , @xmath37 ( see eq .  ) . in our specific experiment , characterized by the parameters listed in table  [ tab : ex ] , numerical values of @xmath38 are presented in table  [ tab : err ] . due to the high statistics in the stationary calibration source measurement , the zn @xmath1 spectrum",
    ", @xmath38 is @xmath39 smaller than when the moving li - like ion emission is used as a reference .    in the case of systematic uncertainties ,",
    "three major sources dominate : the accuracy of the reference energy @xmath40 , of the ion velocity and of the observation angle @xmath41 . similarly to the statistical uncertainty , the contribution of @xmath42 is much smaller when zn lines are used for calibration instead of the li - like u transition ( see table  [ tab : err ] ) .",
    "this is due to the high accuracy of the zinc @xmath1 transition energy , which in the case of @xmath43 is @xmath44  ev @xcite , compared to the li - like u transition accuracy of 0.21  ev @xcite .",
    "if on one hand , doppler tuning of the photon energy in the laboratory frame produce two important systematic uncertainty contributions , due to the ions velocity and the observation angle ; on the other hand , it allows for detecting the different spectral lines in the same narrow spatial region of the ccd detector , i.e. , @xmath45 .",
    "this results in a drastic reduction of other systematic effects such as the influence of uncertainty of the crystal ",
    "ccd distance @xmath30 , the accuracy of the ccd pixel size @xcite , the accuracy of the inter - plane distance of the crystal and effects from the optical aberrations in the johann geometry set - up .",
    "systematic uncertainties related to the relativistic velocity of the ions are treated in detail in the following subsections .",
    "l | r r & he - like u&li - like u + @xmath46 & 0.295578 & 0.257944 + @xmath47 & 1.046771 & 1.035026 + @xmath48(volt ) & 23900 & 17898 + @xmath41 & + @xmath49(volt ) & + @xmath50 & +    l | c c & li - like u&zn @xmath1 + @xmath38 & 0.43 & 0.30 + @xmath51 & 0.21 & 0.04 + @xmath52 & @xmath53 & 0.08 + @xmath54 & 0.01 & 0.04 + @xmath55 & 0.11 & 0.88 + @xmath56 & 0.50 & 0.93 +      the ion velocity in the storage ring is imposed by the velocity of the electrons in the electron cooler @xcite . this is related to the cooler voltage @xmath48 by the simple relations @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the mass and charge of the electron , respectively .",
    "the factor @xmath60 is in general very small , of the order of @xmath61 in our specific case . the cooler voltage uncertainty @xmath62 propagates to the energy uncertainty via the parameters @xmath47 and @xmath46 in eq .  .",
    "more precisely , @xmath63 and @xmath64^{1/2}\\ \\delta v $ ] .",
    "we note that @xmath65 .",
    "for this reason an observation angle of @xmath66 , where the effect of @xmath67 is minimal , was chosen . in the following formulas",
    "we will consider only the case @xmath11 .",
    "the uncertainty of the cooler voltage has two principal sources : the accuracy of the absolute value and its linearity .",
    "the relation between the real voltage value @xmath68 and the set value @xmath48 can be written as @xmath69 , where the single uncertainties on the factors @xmath49 and @xmath50 has to be considered for our analysis . with this notation , for an observation angle of @xmath11 , the uncertainty propagation to the energy value is , for the case of a stationary calibration source , @xmath70 and @xmath71 in the case of a moving calibration source , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the corresponding parameters and where the approximation @xmath74 has been applied .",
    "a reduction of the uncertainties is obtained when the moving calibration source is used .",
    "the uncertainty @xmath52 due to the offset error of @xmath48 is drastically decreased , by a factor @xmath75 , here as the uncertainty due to the linearity is also reduced , but only by a factor @xmath76 .",
    "numerical values for our experiments are given in table  [ tab : ex ] and [ tab : err ] .",
    "if the effect of the uncertainty due to the ion velocity is minimal when @xmath11 , the effect of the uncertainty @xmath77 of the observation angle itself is maximal . in the case",
    "@xmath11 , starting from eq .  , for a stationary calibration source we have @xmath78 and @xmath79 for a moving calibration source .",
    "again , analogously to the calculation of the preceding subsection , a reduction of a factor @xmath80 in the uncertainty is obtained when x rays from fast ions are used for the calibration . in our experimental set - up",
    ", the value of @xmath77 is principally due to the accuracy of the position of the gas - jet target with respect to the main axis of the spectrometer ( @xmath81  mm ) .",
    "numerical values for our experiments are in table  [ tab : ex ] and [ tab : err ] . a direct evaluation of deviation @xmath82 from @xmath66 can be obtained via eq .   with the measurement of the li - like uranium energy @xmath83  ev ( statistical uncertainty only ) using the zinc @xmath1 lines as reference , and its comparison with the literature value @xmath21  ev @xcite .",
    "we estimated @xmath84 in agreement with the expected deviation ( see table  [ tab : ex ] ) .",
    "we present the uncertainty discussion of an accurate energy measurement on he - like uranium intra - shell transition obtained via bragg spectroscopy of doppler - tuned x rays emitted from fast ions .",
    "we have evaluated and compared the systematic uncertainties when a stationary or moving calibration source is used . in particular in our experiment , the use of the x - ray emission of fast li - like uranium ions as reference enables to reduce systematics uncertainties by a factor of about 4 .",
