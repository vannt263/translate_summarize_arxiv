    "asymptotic properties of the laguerre polynomials with large negative parameters were studied by kuijlaars and mclaughlin @xcite in the regime where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 in such a way that @xmath39 exists .",

    "we will focus on the behavior of the recurrence coefficients in the three - term recurrence relation @xmath53 in the asymptotic regime where @xmath37 with @xmath54 with @xmath10 , @xmath3 and @xmath55 are real constants and independent of @xmath24 .",
    "then of course the recurrence coefficients depend on the constants @xmath10 , @xmath3 and @xmath55 , but we suppress it in our notation . in this regime it turns out that we see the appearance of the painlev iv transcendent .",
