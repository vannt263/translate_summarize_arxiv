    "we describe a surprisingly simple connection between gale diagrams and combinatorial alexander duality .    for any set of points on a sphere @xmath4",
    "we associate a covering of @xmath4 by hemispheres . from the theory of gale duality",
    "follows that the nerves of such coverings are exactly those complexes , which are alexander dual to boundaries of simplicial polytopes , or , more generally , to nerve - complexes of polytopes ( see claim [ claimgalealex ] for the precise statement ) . on one hand , this gives a combinatorial characterization of complexes dual to boundaries of simplicial polytopes . on the other hand , geometrical considerations , involving coverings by hemispheres allowed to prove particular statements about convex polytopes .",
    "in section [ secsimpconstr ] we review and define basic constructions , used in the work .",
    "these include alexander duality for simplicial complexes ; nerve - complexes of nonsimplicial polytopes and the construction of a _ constellation complex _ for a configuration of points on a sphere . in section [ secconstel ]",
    "are listed the most important topological and combinatorial properties of constellation complexes . in section [ secgale ]",
    "the gale duality is applied to show that constellation complexes are alexander dual to nerve - complexes of polytopes .",

    "we use hochster formula to show that the stanley",
    " reisner ideal of a constellation complex @xmath5 has a linear resolution .",
    "this means that all generators of modules in the minimal resolution are concentrated in prescribed degrees .",
    "alexander duality leads to the following result : if @xmath6 is a gale diagram of a simplicial polytope @xmath1 , then bigraded betti numbers of the constellation complex @xmath5 coincide with the @xmath3-vector of @xmath1 ( proposition [ propbetticonstel ] ) .",
    "this correspondence can be naturally generalized to polytopes which are not simplicial ( proposition [ propbetticonstelgen ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", one can calculate bigraded betti numbers of a polytope @xmath1 by studying the combinatorial topology of @xmath5 .",
    "originally , this research was motivated by the study of buchstaber invariant ( definition [ definbuchnumber ] ) .",
    "this invariant of simplicial complexes and polytopes appeared naturally in toric topology , and in 2002 v.m.buchstaber posed a problem : to describe this number combinatorially .",
    "since then several approaches to this problem had been developed .",
    "i.izmestiev @xcite found a connection between buchstaber invariants and a chromatic number .",
    "this connection was further developed in work @xcite . in the paper @xcite real buchstaber invariant of skeleta of simplices",
    "was determined by integer linear programming .",
    "n.yu.erokhovets in his thesis @xcite , and other works @xcite built the theory of buchstaber invariants , constructed many examples and estimations , and found equivalent definitions for these numbers .",
    "we refer the reader to his surveys @xcite or @xcite to find out more about particular results and open problems in this field .",
    "recent result @xcite and gale duality allowed to prove the following conjecture , made in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath1 is a polytope , then @xmath7 if and only if @xmath1 is a pyramid ( theorem [ thmpyramids ] ) .",
    "result of @xcite can also be applied to construct polytopes with @xmath2 from their gale diagrams .",
    "this consideration had led to interesting combinatorial consequences ( theorem [ propfanocircle ] and statement [ propfanocircle ] ) .",
    "we hope that gale diagrams will allow to answer the question posed by nickolai erokhovets in @xcite : whether buchstaber invariant is determined by bigraded betti numbers of a simplicial complex ? probably , gale diagrams will lead to the solutions of other open problems concerning buchstaber invariants of polytopes .",
