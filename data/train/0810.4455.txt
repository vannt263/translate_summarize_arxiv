    "to date cold atom interferometers have demonstrated rotation sensitivities comparable to ring laser and mechanical gyroscopes @xcite .",
    "several atom interferometer schemes have been realized , and thus far free space fountain and beam configurations , that utilize light pulses to manipulate the atoms , have demonstrated the greatest sensitivities @xcite . while the lack of external potential reduces systematic errors , atom interferometry in free space is limited by acceleration due to gravity . in particular , the precision of an interferometer is directly proportional to the interrogation time and in free space this time is limited by the size of the vacuum chamber . in the most sensitive free space atom interferometers , the atomic clouds travel up to 10 meters @xcite .",
    "the large scale of free space interferometers limits their applications .",
    "there is currently a great effort being made to reduce the size of atom interferometers while simultaneously increasing their sensitivity .",
    "one straightforward way to achieve this goal is to develop interferometers that trap the atoms in an external potential for the duration of the interferometer cycle .",
    "the external potential prevents the atoms from falling due to gravity , and keeps the atomic gas from expanding in the vacuum chamber . as a result , the interferometer cycle time is not as limited by the size of the chamber .",
    "several groups have built trapped atom interferometers using atomic gases that are both above and below the recoil temperature @xcite . to date ,",
    "all interferomters that use gases below the recoil temperature have utilized atoms in a nearly pure bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) .",
    "if the gas is cooled below the recoil temperature and is split using a laser pulse , a large relative separation between each arm of the interferometer can be achieved @xcite . by exposing the atoms in each arm to a different environment , precision measurements of localized phenomena can be performed .",
    "for example , the ac stark shift in @xmath0 was recently measured by exposing the atoms in one arm of an interferometer to laser light @xcite .    in some applications , such as the sensing of rotations and accelerations , cloud separation is not necessary and interferomters that use non - degenerate source are sufficient .",
    "these sources can be produced by laser cooling alone .",
    "additionally , non - degenerate atomic gases have a much lower density compared to a bec and therefore experience a weaker mean - field potential .",
    "the mean - field potential directly couples number uncertainty into phase uncertainty via number dependent phase diffusion @xcite .",
    "one advantage of working with laser cooled gases is that dephasing due to number fluctuations is ameliorated .    besides the elimination of mean - field effects , atom interferometers that use laser cooled atomic gases",
    "are less sensitive to heating due to imperfections in the confining potential than a bec .",
    "atoms in a pure bec experience no momentum changing collisions with other atoms in the same mode .",
    "therefore , an interferometer that uses a pure bec will experience little decoherence due to collisions .",
    "however , if a bec is heated , atoms will leave the condensate and will experience an increase in the collision frequency . as a result , the decoherence rate will increase with temperature . on the other hand , if the interferometer uses a laser cooled gas with a temperature much greater than the bec transition temperature , the density will decrease as the temperature increases and the decoherence rate will decrease if the gas is inadvertently heated .",
    "several different methods for building atom interferometers using laser cooled gases have been developed @xcite and time - domain atom interferometers that use a single internal quantum state @xcite lend themselves naturally for use with trapped atomic gases .",
    "this type of interferometer uses a series of optical standing waves to manipulate the external states of the atoms in the cloud .",
    "the interferometric cycle begins by loading an atomic cloud in a magneto - optical trap .",
    "the trap is switched off and the atomic cloud begins to fall due to gravity . at the time @xmath1 ,",
    "the cloud is illuminated with a short pulse from the standing wave laser field . shortly after the pulse",
    ", the cloud has a density modulation with a period of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the wavelength of the laser field .",
    "the density modulation then disappears because of the thermal motion of the atoms in the cloud . at the time",
    "@xmath4 the gas is illuminated with a second pulse .",
    "due to the talbot - lau effect , there is an echo of the density modulation at the times @xmath5 , for integers @xmath6 . if the atomic cloud experiences a non - uniform potential during the interferometer cycle , the density echos will be shifted relative to the initial modulation .",
    "the shift in the phase of the modulation can be determined by reflecting a probe pulse from a single laser beam off of the echo .",
    "the phase of the reflected probe pulse is directly proportional to the phase shift in the density modulation . by interfering the reflected probe pulse with a reference beam ,",
    "the interferometer s signal can be read .",
    "recently , a trapped time domain atom interferometer was built by the group at harvard @xcite .",
    "this interferometer used an atom wave guide to confine the atoms in the perpendicular directions while allowing them to freely propagate along the parallel direction .",
    "a series of standing wave laser pulses were applied to the atoms , such that the wave vectors of the lasers pointed along the free direction of the guide .",
    "the harvard group demonstrated that it is possible to electronically move the wave guide back and fourth perpendicular to the free direction of the wave guide so that the arms of the interferometer enclose an area , making the interferometer sensitive to rotations @xcite .",
    "a major difficulty with all trapped atom interferometers that use optical pulses is that the residual potential along the guide causes decoherence @xcite .",
    "the groups that have built bec based interferometers have mitigated the decoherence by either using a double reflection geometry or using the classical turning points of the residual potential to reflect the atoms .",
    "the harvard group has reduced the effects of the residual potential by using an interferometric cycles with several laser pulses @xcite .",
    "although this multi - pulse scheme greatly increases the coherence time of the interferometer , it also reduces the number of atoms participating as well as reducing the area inclosed by the interferometer .",

    "simultaneously the trap is moved downwards by cycling the current in the wires .",
    "if the interferometer is rotating about the plane of the paper with frequency @xmath8 , the coriolis force will accelerate the cloud in the parallel direction .",
    "( e ) the cycling of the currents in the wires is timed so that the trap is above the bottom wire at half a period of the parallel trap @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the trap period in the parallel direction .",

    "the modulation is shifted due to the rotation of the interferometer .",
    "the cycle ( c ) through ( g ) can be repeated many times . since the oscillating coriolis force is resonant with the parallel trap frequency , the shift in the displacement of the cloud will increase after each cycle .",
    "( h ) after @xmath12 cycles , the displacement of the cloud is precisely measured by reflecting a probe beam off of the density modulation and interfering the reflected light with a reference beam .",
    "the probe pulse only interacts strongly with the cloud when there is a density modulation across the cloud . as a result",
    ", the probe pulse can be longer than the duration of the modulation echo .",
    "small fluctuations in the trap frequency can be measured simultaneously with the phase shift and using thermal atoms avoids the critical timing needed when a bec is used @xcite .",
    "it may prove possible to measure the interference signal more than once in any given experiment . as a result",
    ", it might be possible to split the atoms once , and measure the rotation frequency several times as the cloud oscillates in the trap .    during interferometer cycle",
    ", collisions between the trapped atoms will bring the gas back to equilibrium , causing a reduction in the amplitude of the density modulation .",
