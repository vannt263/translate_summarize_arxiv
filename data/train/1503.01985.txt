    "bell s theorem  @xcite and the kochen - specker theorem  @xcite are perhaps two of the results which have been most influential in developing the modern understanding of quantum mechanics as an irreducibly non - classical theory  @xcite .",
    "moreover , these two no - go theorems are seen as the strongest argument for quantum mechanics being a fundamentally indeterministic theory , rather than one ruled by a deeper determinism below the level of the quantum mechanical description of reality .",
    "bell s theorem , which shows that quantum mechanics predicts statistical correlations between separated particles greater than what would be possible in any local , realistic , classical theory , was the focus of attention for several decades due to its relatively clear ability to be tested experimentally  @xcite .",
    "the kochen - specker theorem was proved very shortly afterwards , but was largely ignored due to a perceived lack of testability , and perhaps also its formalisation in terms of partial algebras , until it attracted renewed attention with the more recent advances in quantum information theory and foundations .",
    "in contrast to the bounds on probability distributions given by bell s theorem , the kochen - specker theorem shows that the hilbert - space structure of quantum mechanics makes it impossible to assign ` classical ' definite values to all quantum observables in a consistent manner .",
    "since such a definite value is precisely a ( deterministic ) hidden variable specifying , in advance , the result of a measurement of an observable , this means that the outcomes of all quantum measurements on a system can not be simultaneously predetermined .",
    "more recent developments have significantly reduced the size and difficulty of proofs of the kochen - specker theorem  @xcite and converted such proofs into testable inequalities  @xcite .",
    "however , in showing the impossibility of a classical deterministic ` two - valued ' measure ( i.e. , value assignment ) the kochen - specker theorem leaves open several possible conclusions .",
    "the kochen - specker theorem , more specifically , finds a contradiction between the following three assumptions , which will be formalised more rigorously a little later :    * all observables are assigned a definite value ( i.e. , are ` value definite ' ) ; * this definite value should be noncontextual  that is , assigned as a function of the observable alone , and not depending on other compatible observables ; * the definite values for a set of compatible observables must be consistent with the theoretical quantum predictions for the relations between them .    condition ( iii ) is largely uncontroversial and hence one must generally conclude that either ( or even both ) ( i ) and ( ii ) must be given up .",
    "several alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics are contextual ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , and hence discard ( ii ) . perhaps the more popular interpretation , however , is that the inability to simultaneously assign noncontextual definite values , representing predetermined measurement outcomes , to all observables means that measurement outcomes are not determined in advance at all : that quantum mechanics represents a value indefinite reality .",
    "this interpretation is often referred to simply as ` contextuality ' in the literature ; however we reserve this term strictly for the contextual behaviour of definite values .",
    "if we choose to require ( ii ) to hold , at least for any observables that are assigned definite values , then there remains an oft - overlooked gap between the formal result of the kochen - specker theorem and the general interpretation of it .",
    "indeed , the negation of ( i ) is that _ not all _ observables are assigned definite values : it does not prove that no observable can be assigned a definite value and hence , given that definite values represent predetermined measurement outcomes , does not show that all measurements must result in the _ ex nihilo _ creation of an outcome , nor does it allow one to know _ which _ observables in any set are value indefinite .",
    "we can , of course , postulate that if some observables are value indefinite , then this should , by symmetry or uniformity considerations , be the case for all observables ( or at least those for which the born rule assigns a probability strictly between 0 and 1 to some outcomes ) .",
    "however , it is key to realise that this is not in any sense a formal consequence of the kochen - specker theorem , and constitutes an additional , undesired , assumption .    in this paper",
    "we address precisely this issue . as is common in modern treatments of the kochen - specker theorem  @xcite we focus on one - dimensional ( rank-1 ) projection observables , and we denote the observable projecting onto the linear subspace spanned by a vector @xmath0 as @xmath1 . by using a modified , weakened set of assumptions , we prove that if one such projection observable @xmath2 is assigned the value 1 , then no other such projection observable @xmath3 can be consistently assigned a definite value unless @xmath2 and @xmath3 commute . in interpreting this result physically , we note that if a system is prepared in the state @xmath0 then the outcome of a measurement of the observable @xmath2 is known to be 1 with certainty , and thus any value assignment representing the outcomes of possible measurements on the system should assign the value 1 to @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath3 does not commute with @xmath2 it is therefore value indefinite under such a value assignment and hence can not have a consistently predetermined measurement outcome .",
    "this self - contained , analytic proof extends and generalises the results of  @xcite .    throughout the paper we will assume ( ii ) to hold , as is common in interpretations of the kochen - specker theorem , and",
    "our strengthened results and interpretation of the kochen - specker theorem thus rely on this condition .",
    "we do not attempt to justify this assumption here , as this is an interpretational choice and the subject of much debate ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "4 ) for an overview ) , which is beyond the scope of this paper .      as usual",
    "we denote by @xmath4 the set of complex numbers and use the standard quantum mechanical bra - ket notion ; that is , we denote ( unit ) vectors in the hilbert space @xmath5 by @xmath6 . as mentioned above , we will focus on one - dimensional projection observables and denote by @xmath2 the operator projecting onto the linear subspace spanned by @xmath0 ; that is , @xmath7 .    in the following we formalise hidden variables and",
    "the notion of value definiteness in a clear and unambiguous fashion .",
    "this framework is based on that we developed in  @xcite , and similar to standard approaches to the kochen - specker theorem  @xcite ; we have made several simplifications since we do not wish to explore contextual definite values or hidden variable theories in any detail here .",
    "we fix a positive integer @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 be a nonempty set of one - dimensional projection observables on the hilbert space @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "a set @xmath11 is a _ context of @xmath12 _ if @xmath13 has @xmath14 elements ( i.e. , @xmath15 ) and for all @xmath16 with @xmath17 , @xmath18 .    since distinct one - dimensional projection observables",
    "commute if and only if they project onto mutually orthogonal linear subspaces , a context @xmath13 of @xmath12 is thus a maximal set of compatible one - dimensional projection observables on @xmath5 . because there is a direct correspondence ( up to a phase - shift ) between unit vectors and one - dimensional projection observables , a context is uniquely defined by an orthonormal basis of @xmath5 . recall that a partial function is one which may be undefined for some values . if it is defined everywhere , then it is total .",
    "[ def : v ] a _ value assignment function ( on @xmath12 ) _ is a partial two - valued function @xmath19 , assigning values to some ( possibly all ) observables in @xmath12 .",
    "we note that we could , as in  @xcite , allow @xmath20 to be a function of both the observable @xmath21 and the context @xmath13 containing @xmath21 , allowing values to be assigned contextually",
    ". it would perhaps be more correct to call @xmath20 , as defined above in definition  [ def : v ] , a _",
    "noncontextual _ value assignment function ; however , since we are interested only in the noncontextual case , we avoid this for compactness .",
    "an observable @xmath22 is _ value definite ( under @xmath20 ) _ if @xmath23 is defined ; otherwise it is _ value indefinite ( under @xmath20)_. similarly , we call @xmath12 value definite ( under @xmath20 ) if every observable @xmath22 is value definite .      with this terminology , we can state the kochen - specker theorem formally .",
    "we present it in the following form deliberately in order to draw the comparison to our earlier informal description , and to clarify the following discussion , even though the second condition is redundant because we require , by definition , that a value assignment function be noncontextual .",
    "let @xmath24 .",
    "then there exists a ( finite ) set of one - dimensional projection observables @xmath12 on the hilbert space @xmath5 such that there is no value assignment function @xmath20 satisfying the following three conditions :    * @xmath12 is value definite under @xmath20 ; that is , @xmath20 is a total function . *",
    "the value @xmath23 of an observable @xmath22 depends only on @xmath21 and not the context containing @xmath21 . * for every context @xmath13 of @xmath12 the following condition holds : is a _",
    "boolean frame function _ with weight 1  @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath25 .",
    "the third condition expresses the fact that only one projection observable in a context can be assigned the value 1 . as we mentioned earlier , this is largely uncontroversial : one can simultaneously measure the observables in a context and quantum mechanics predicts precisely that exactly one of these measurements should give the result ` 1 ' , thus any corresponding definite values assigned to these observables should obey this same condition .",
    "hence , if we assume ( ii ) to be true  at least for observables that are value definite for which the statement makes clear sense  then the kochen - specker theorem requires us to conclude the negation of ( i ) : that @xmath12 can not be value definite , and hence _ at least one _ observable must be value indefinite .    note",
    "that the third condition is not independent of the first : it is not clear how the sum @xmath26 should be evaluated if @xmath23 is undefined .",
    "this is one of the key issues we will clarify in attempting to localise value indefiniteness .",
    "while the kochen - specker theorem certainly succeeds , as was the original intention , in showing that quantum mechanics must obey an entirely non - classical event structure , it does not , as we have pointed out , show that all observables must be value indefinite and their outcomes intrinsically indeterministic . as a consequence of the global nature of the hypothesis of the theorem ",
    "that _ all _ observables are value definite  one can only draw a global conclusion : that _ not all _ observables are value definite .",
    "that is , the theorem , even under the assumption of noncontextuality , can not ` locate ' value indefiniteness to any particular observable .",
    "this is an important point , not only for the foundational understanding of quantum mechanics , but also in practical applications : quantum random number generators and cryptographic schemes rely on the indeterminism of quantum mechanics providing ` irreducible randomness '  @xcite . to certify such claims , it is important to be able to localise value indefiniteness to ensure it applies to the observables measured in such applications .",
    "we proceed by providing more nuanced and less demanding , localised versions of the kochen - specker assumptions , and use these to localise value indefiniteness ( always under the assumption of noncontextuality for value definite observables ) .",
    "our approach is a conservative one : rather than assuming complete value definiteness of the entire set of observables considered , we require observables to be value definite only when their indefiniteness would allow the possibility of measurements violating the quantum predictions specified in condition ( iii ) of the kochen - specker theorem ( see the more detailed discussion and example below ) .    in order for this approach to work , we need , as a premise , at least one observable to be value definite .",
    "we then show that the assumption that _ any other _",
    "observable is value definite leads to a contradiction .",
    "fortunately , there is a justification for this premise : if a system is prepared in an arbitrary state @xmath27 , then measurement of the observable @xmath2 should yield the outcome 1 .",
    "thus , it seems reasonable to require that , if @xmath28 , then @xmath29 . we call this the _ eigenstate assumption _  @xcite , which is similar to , although weaker than , the ` eigenstate - eigenvalue link ' discussed in  @xcite . furthermore , since the critical feature of a set @xmath12 of projection observables is the orthogonality relations between these observables rather than the specific form of these observables , we can hence choose our basis at will .",
    "it is thus not unreasonable to consider that some one - dimensional projection observable in @xmath12 has the value 1 , and to fix the basis used to express @xmath12 to that of the state @xmath0 to make this observable coincide with @xmath2 .",
    "let us finally discuss how assumption ( iii ) can be generalised for partial value assignment functions @xmath20 , that is , the case where some observables in @xmath12 may be value indefinite .",
    "[ admis - rules ] let @xmath12 be a set of one - dimensional projection observables on @xmath5 and let @xmath30 be a value assignment function .",
    "then @xmath20 is _ admissible _ if the following two conditions hold for every context @xmath13 of @xmath12 :    * if there exists a @xmath31 with @xmath32 , then @xmath33 for all @xmath34 ; * if there exists a @xmath31 with @xmath33 for all @xmath34 , then @xmath32 .",
    "admissibility requires that the quantum predictions of ( iii ) are never violated , while allowing the value indefiniteness of an observable @xmath21 if both outcomes ( 0 and 1 ) of a measurement of @xmath21 would be compatible with the definite values of other observables sharing a context with @xmath21 . for example , if @xmath32 , then a measurement of all the observables in a context @xmath13 containing @xmath21 must yield the outcome 1 for @xmath21 , and hence to avoid contradiction the outcome 0 for the other observables in the context . on the other hand , if @xmath35 , even though measurement of @xmath21 must yield the outcome 0 , any of the other observables in @xmath13 could yield the value 1 or 0 ( as long as only one yields 1 ) , hence we should not conclude the value definiteness of these other observables .",
    "let us illustrate the difference between our weakened assumptions , and in particular admissibility , with the hypotheses of the kochen - specker theorem .",

    "[ fig : cabello](a ) , the contradiction obtained at @xmath53 marked by the cross is a consequence of a specific succession of applications of the admissibility rules ( a ) and ( b ) in definition  [ admis - rules ] . by applying these rules in a different order , one can obtain the contradiction also at @xmath54 , @xmath55 , or @xmath56 .",

    "[ fig : cabello ] does not suffice to prove that @xmath58 must be value indefinite , and hence can not be used to localise value indefiniteness .",

    "let us first discuss some important relevant issues .",
    "this theorem has a slightly different form from the standard kochen - specker theorem because of the requirement that a particular observable in the set @xmath12 be assigned the value 1 .",
    "however , since , as we will see , it is only the orthogonality relations between the observables in @xmath12 which is important , a change of basis can always ensure that the required observable @xmath2 be assigned the value 1 .    in order to interpret this result",
    "one has to take into account the eigenstate assumption discussed in the previous section : if a quantum system is prepared in a state @xmath0 in @xmath24 dimensional hilbert space , then every one - dimensional projection observable that does not commute with @xmath2 is value indefinite and hence can not have a predetermined measurement outcome .",
    "the first question to address is whether existing kochen - specker diagrams ( i.e. , greechie diagrams specifying the orthogonality relations of @xmath12 ) could be used to provide a set @xmath12 of observables proving theorem  [ thm : main ] ; it is not _ a priori _ obvious that such diagrams are unable to do so .",
    "in section  [ sec : cabelloexample ] we showed , as an example , that a particular simple and well - known kochen - specker diagram is not sufficient for this purpose .",
    "a careful search through existing diagrams showed that this is the case in general , and we were unable to find an existing kochen - specker diagram in which there are two observables @xmath49 and @xmath50 with the required property that if @xmath46 , both @xmath47 and @xmath59 lead to a contradiction .",
    "a second conceptual problem with the use of fixed kochen - specker diagrams as in existing proofs is the following .",
    "since , in order to derive a contradiction , we need to assume that an observable @xmath2 in the given observable set has @xmath29 , this limits the observables which can be shown to be value indefinite to , at best , the remaining ones in @xmath62 . however , we wish to prove more : that _ every _ one - dimensional projection observable not commuting with @xmath2 is value indefinite .    as a result , we need not only a set of observables with the required properties discussed above , but furthermore an approach to generalise this set of observables to arbitrary other observables .",
    "we overcome this apparent lack of generality via a method of reductions , which we present in the next section and will return to discuss later on .",
    "we prove theorem  [ thm : main ] in three main steps :    1 .",
    "we first prove it for the special case that @xmath63 . a similar result ( for @xmath64 )",
    "was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , but this involved two separate diagrams applying to separate cases . here",
    "we give a single diagram providing a much more compact , clear proof .",
    "2 .   we prove a simple reduction for @xmath65 to the first case .",

    "theorem  [ thm : main ] implies that no one - dimensional projection observable @xmath21 can have a predetermined measurement outcome for the system unless @xmath0 is an eigenstate of @xmath21 .",

    "conceptually , this means that theorem  [ thm : main ] goes further than the kochen - specker theorem in showing the _ extent _ of non - classicality that the quantum logic event - structure implies .",
    "it is possible to generalise this result  that formally applies only to one - dimensional projection observables  to the value - indefiniteness of more general classes of observables . since an observable @xmath275 ( formally a hermitian operator in @xmath14-dimensional hilbert space ) with a non - degenerate spectrum , distinct eigenvalues @xmath276 and eigenstates @xmath277 can be expressed as its spectral decomposition @xmath278 ( where @xmath279 , as usual ) , it physically has a predetermined measurement outcome if and",

    "while such results do not affect the interpretation of the theorem , they have merit in showing the depth of the contradiction between the classical and quantum logical structures .",
    "more recently , smaller proofs have been of particular interest since these have been used to derive noncontextuality inequalities that can be experimentally tested  @xcite in the same vein as bell - inequalities  @xcite ; smaller sets of observables lead to smaller and more readily testable inequalities .",
    "conceptually , however , the key point is probably that the theorem can be proved using a _",

    "the localised nature of theorem  [ thm : main ] immediately means that a single finite set @xmath12 of one - dimensional projection observables will never suffice to prove the value indefiniteness of all such projection observables @xmath3 not commuting with @xmath2 for a given state @xmath0 .",
    "there are infinitely many such observables , and one must , by definition , include @xmath3 in @xmath12 to localise value indefiniteness to @xmath3 .",

    "thus , it would be preferable to find a given set of orthogonality relations for which a set @xmath285 of observables realising these relations and containing both @xmath2 and @xmath3 for any @xmath3 . since we were unable to give such a set of relations , we had to iterate lemma  [ lemma : reduction2 ] a number of times times depending on @xmath2 , with no upper bound ( but only ever finitely many times ) .    furthermore , it seems that it is difficult , if not impossible , to succeed in giving a fixed set of orthogonality relations that works in all cases . in order to show an observable @xmath49",

    "one can emphasise further the state - independence of theorem  [ thm : main ] by restating the theorem in the following form : _ `` only a single one - dimensional projection observable on the hilbert space @xmath5 for @xmath24 can be assigned the value 1 by an admissible , noncontextual value assignment function''_. in this form the state - independence is clear ; the illusion of state - dependence enters because of the connection , via the eigenstate assumption , between the `` one observable assigned the value 1 '' and the particular state @xmath0 ( and corresponding observable @xmath2 with @xmath29 ) which is necessary for the physical interpretation of the theorem .",
    "the importance of the state - independence of the kochen - specker theorem arises , in part , in the use of kochen - specker sets of observables in testable inequalities .",
    "it is important to note that , even though these inequalities are sometimes referred to as `` kochen - specker inequalities ''  @xcite , they are better seen simply as noncontextuality inequalities .",
    "these inequalities are derived under the assumption only of noncontextuality , ignoring the admissibility requirements , and bounds on quantities are calculated over all possible noncontextual value assignments .",
    "a key result shows that one can derive such an inequality from any kochen - specker set  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that these value assignments can not obey the admissibility requirements , since the kochen - specker theorem shows precisely that no classical value assignment can do so .",
    "the strength of theorem  [ thm : main ] , on the other hand , relies precisely on the use of the admissibility requirements to determine when definite values should be assigned . hence , while one can use the methods of  @xcite to derive inequalities from the constructions in the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] , these bounds would be calculated over all noncontextual value assignments ( subject to @xmath29 ) , without paying heed to admissibility , and hence would offer no conceptual advantage over existing inequalities .",
    "furthermore , since our construction in lemma  [ lemma : explicitcase ] , for example , contains 37 observables , these would pose no experimental benefit to existing , simpler inequalities either  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the state - independence of the result shows that the value indefiniteness of almost all one - dimensional projection observables in quantum mechanics is indeed a deep feature of the theory  of the logical structure of hilbert space  rather than a property of particular states .",
    "in summary , we proved a variant of the kochen - specker theorem showing that the non - classicality implied by the kochen - specker theorem is , in a specific sense , maximal .",
    "specifically , under the assumptions that ( 1 ) any value definite observables behave noncontextually , and ( 2 ) contexts obey weak ` admissibility ' rules on any value definite observables they contain , we show that only one one - dimensional projection observable on the hilbert space @xmath5 ( for @xmath24 ) can be assigned consistently the definite value 1 .",
    "if a quantum system is prepared in a state @xmath0 , subject to the assumption that any value assignment function for the system must assign the value 1 to @xmath2 since @xmath295 , the theorem can be interpreted as showing that the measurement of any observable @xmath3 projecting onto the linear subspace spanned by a state @xmath294 that is neither orthogonal nor co - aligned with @xmath0 must be value indefinite  that is , indeterministic .",
    "this interpretation , which shows that almost all one - dimensional projection observables are value indefinite for a given system  @xcite , is stronger than what can be drawn from the kochen - specker theorem , which , in contrast , shows only that not all observables can be value definite .",
    "this result justifies further the general belief that quantum mechanics is indeterministic  that there is no hidden variable or definite value determining the outcome of a measurement in advance .",
    "this eliminates the need to assume that the non - classicality shown by the kochen - specker theorem should apply uniformly , instead deriving this global value indefiniteness . as with the kochen - specker theorem ,",
    "this result relies on the assumption that classical values , should they exist , must behave noncontextually .",
    "finally , these results help theoretically certify quantum random number generators  @xcite , since the promises of such devices rely on the indeterministic nature of quantum measurements  @xcite . by localising value",
    "indefinite observables , one can be sure that the measurements producing the output bits do not yield any pre - existing element of physical reality .",
    "we emphasise that these results do not hold for two - dimensional systems  a class into which many current quantum random number generators unfortunately fall .",
