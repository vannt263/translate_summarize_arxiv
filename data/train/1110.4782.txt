    "in view of the great importance of dna in biology and biotechnology , there has been a considerable interest in the past years in the modeling of dynamics and equilibrium properties of dna molecules  @xcite .",
    "from the perspective of statistical physics , dna is an interesting system as it shows a broad range of phenomena such as phase transitions in response to temperature changes and to the application of mechanical forces .",
    "a paradigmatic example is that of the melting transition , i.e. the separation of the two strands of the helix induced by a temperature change , which has been the object of considerable attention by the scientific community  @xcite . also the melting _",
    "dynamics _ , and in particular the openings of bubbles , has been the topic of various studies  @xcite . a new aspect which shows up prominently in the dynamics , while being of less importance in equilibrium , is the helical nature of the double - stranded dna , which lead to models of dna molecules which approximately include helical degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "also , in a recent simulation study involving two of us  @xcite , the scaling relation between the unwinding time @xmath9 of a double - helical structure , as a function of its length @xmath10 , has been studied , with the result @xmath11 . a theoretical understanding of this scaling is still missing .    a system closely related to the unwinding of a double - helical structure , is the unwinding of a single polymer initially wound around a fixed bar .",
    "the advantage of this latter system is that it has a cleanly defined reaction coordinate : the winding angle of the free end .",
    "while it is our ultimate goal to understand fully the dynamics of unwinding , the topic of the current research is restricted to identify the equilibrium properties of a single polymer wound around a bar , thereby providing a solid basis for further research .    further motivation behind our study ,",
    "is that there has been quite some recent interest in the study of topological properties of long flexible polymers , inspired by biology , in the context of chromosomal segregation ( see e.g. ref .",
    "the scaling behavior of the probability distribution function of linking numbers of two closed polymer rings reveals some interesting properties which could explain segregation of chromatide domains  @xcite .",
    "the winding angle distribution of a polymer attached to a bar is an analog of the linking number , so it is natural to ask whether the results discussed here could be extended to other topological invariants for closed curves .",
    "the study of winding properties of random and self - avoiding walks has a long history which dates back to more than half a century ago  @xcite .",
    "these properties are relevant for many applications in different domains of statistical physics @xcite . in a few simple cases the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of winding angles can be computed exactly .",
    "for instance , the pdf of a planar random walk winding around a circle of finite radius is  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the winding angle and @xmath10 the length of the walk .",
    "these quantities appear in the pdf as a single scaling variable @xmath14 .",
    "planar self - avoiding walks were studied first by fisher _",
    "_ @xcite . on the basis of scaling arguments and numerical results",
    "they suggested that the distribution of winding angles is gaussian with a variance growing as @xmath15 ( as opposed to that of planar random walks in which @xmath16 , see eq .",
    "( [ disk_abs ] ) ) .",
    "these findings were corroborated by an exact distribution @xcite @xmath17 obtained some years later by conformal invariance techniques .",
    "the winding angle distribution of several other polymer systems were considered , as for instance two - dimensional polymers with orientation - dependent interactions  @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of these polymers contains different phases , e.g. spiral collapsed , normal collapsed and swollen , separated by a theta point .",
    "the winding angle distribution turns out to be universal  @xcite .",
    "it is gaussian with a variance @xmath18 , where the coefficient @xmath19 takes different values in different phases .",
    "the gaussian behavior is therefore a robust feature for self - avoiding walks in two dimensions .",
    "no exact distribution is known in the case of a polymer attached by one end to a rigid bar , which is the case studied in this paper ( see fig .  [ saw3d ] ) .",
    "using renormalization group techniques , in 1988 , rudnick and hu @xcite considered a self - avoiding walk in @xmath20 dimensions whose path wraps around a surface of dimension @xmath21 .",
    "the probability distribution for a winding angle @xmath13 of a polymer of length @xmath10 , at first order in @xmath8 , is @xcite @xmath22 which surprisingly matches the exact form of a planar self - avoiding walk , given in eq .",
    "( [ saw_2d ] ) , by simply setting @xmath23 .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite also performed numerical calculations of the variance @xmath24 for self - avoiding walks of length @xmath25 . due to the limited computing power available at that time",
    ", only a pre - asymptotic regime could be investigated , which showed a scaling consistent with that of random walks : @xmath16 .",
    "another interesting class of systems is three - dimensional directed walks winding around a line  @xcite , which model the behavior of flux lines in high-@xmath26 superconductors .",
    "when projected on the plane perpendicular to the line , the winding problem reduces to that of a two - dimensional random walk winding around a center .",
    "the winding angle distribution follows again an exponential decay ( as for eq .",
    "( [ disk_abs ] ) ) , with a decay constant depending on the type of boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "the distribution is however a gaussian in the presence of random impurities in the bulk  @xcite with the same scaling variable as in eq .",
    "( [ saw_2d ] ) .",
    "the pinning effect of the impurities makes the walks meander in the direction away from the line , with an excursion size growing as @xmath27 for a path of length @xmath28 .",
    "this behavior is close to that of three - dimensional self - avoiding walks ( @xmath29 with @xmath30 ) , which may suggest that the winding angle distribution of self - avoiding walks around a bar would be gaussian",
    ". this would also be in agreement with the @xmath8-expansion distribution ( eq .  ( [ sawepsilon ] ) ) , when setting @xmath31 .",
    "we will , however , show that the winding angle distribution for a self - avoiding walk around a bar does not follow gaussian behavior .",
    "in addition the variance @xmath24 turns out to scale with a non - trivial power of @xmath32 .",
    "the numerical results presented in this paper are obtained by monte carlo simulations of lattice polymers up to @xmath1 on a face - centered - cubic lattice and by exact enumerations of short walks ( @xmath33 ) on a cubic lattice . in both cases",
    "one end of the polymer is attached to the bar , while the other is free . in the exact enumeration study",
    "all the possible configurations of a polymer attached at one end to a bar on a simple cubic lattice were generated using a backtracking method , and the averaged squared winding angle was computed . in the monte carlo simulations we performed equilibrium sampling using two types of updates : ( 1 ) local moves , such as",
    "corner flips and end - monomer flips and ( 2 ) global moves , involving the rotation of a whole branch of the polymer from a selected point via the pivot algorithm ( see  @xcite for a detailed study of this algorithm ) .",
    "this algorithm is very efficient because of the small autocorrelation time .",
    "recently it was applied to the computation of the growth exponent @xmath34 for very long polymers  @xcite .",
    "one monomer is chosen randomly as the pivot point and a random operation of symmetry allowed by the lattice ( rotation or reflection ) is applied to the branch of the polymer not attached to the bar .",
    "this attempt is accepted if it satisfies the self - avoidance .     with @xmath35 $ ] ( from bottom to top ) .",
    "a unit of time corresponds to @xmath10 attempts with corner flips and 15 attempted pivots . the correlation time is estimated through the integration of these curves  @xcite . ]",
    "the acceptance ratio @xmath36 ( the ratio of accepted moves over the total number of attempts ) of the pivot algorithm scales as @xmath37 where @xmath38 in two dimensions and @xmath39 in three dimensions  @xcite .",
    "our estimates for @xmath36 compare well with those of  @xcite , but are however slightly smaller due to collisions with the bar .",
    "for the range of sizes investigated in this article , the acceptance ratio varies between @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) and @xmath42 ( @xmath1 ) . in the following , one unit of time",
    "consists of 15 attempted pivots moves , on average corresponding to 5 accepted pivot moves for the biggest sizes , and @xmath10 attempted corner flips . since the structure of the fcc lattice allows a winding over an angle of @xmath43 within 6 links , the maximum winding angle is @xmath44 .",

    "first , to connect our work more directly with dna melting , we intend to introduce an attractive interaction between the polymer and the bar , mimicking the hybridization between the two dna - strands .",
    "this interaction will initially be homogeneous , but later might have a random component to capture the difference between the binding strengths of at and cg bonds .",
    "how such interactions influence the equilibirum statistics of winding , is an open issue .",
    "secondly , we want to combine the results presented here with earlier work involving some of us on the unwinding dynamics  @xcite , which is still an open issue ."
