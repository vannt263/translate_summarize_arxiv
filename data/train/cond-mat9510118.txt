    "during the last five years the fabrication of ballistic two - dimensional electron gas microstructures in gaas / ga@xmath0al@xmath1as heterostructures has opened up a new field : the study of quantum manifestations of classical chaos in condensed matter systems.@xcite the first theoretical discussion@xcite of the so - called quantum chaos in microstructures dealt with open systems , i.e. , cavities on the micrometer scale or smaller connected to the external world by leads that admit a continuous flow of electrons .",
    "several successful experiments followed.@xcite nowadays the theoretical study of quantum chaos is also well developed for closed microstructures , known as quantum dots.@xcite these are cavities coupled to the external leads by tunnel barriers that prevent a continuous flow of electrons and make the electric charge inside the dot quantized .",
    "the striking characteristic of quantum dots is the appearance of very sharp peaks in the conductance as a function of the gate voltage .",
    "these peaks are roughly equidistant due to the strong charging effect , but their heights vary randomly by an order of magnitude or more . the general interest in this phenomenon , combined with the existence of interesting experimental data on quantum chaos for closed systems,@xcite motivated several theoretical studies.@xcite these works proposed universal conductance peak distributions for quantum dots in the coulomb blockade regime as fingerprints of the underlying chaotic dynamics . similar predictions for open systems@xcite have been difficult to observe experimentally@xcite because of the strong influence of dephasing.@xcite    the initial experiments on coulomb blockade peak heights in quantum dots@xcite have paved the way for the first convincing measurements of statistical distributions of peak heights.@xcite however , the full distribution of the conductance peaks is not a trivial quantity to measure .",
    "since each peak sequence is not very long , good statistics demands great experimental effort .",
    "one possible solution is a true ensemble averaging , which requires many different samples . in ref .",
    "it was suggested that one could obtain such an average from a single device by changing its shape _ in situ _ using external electrostatic potentials .",
    "this difficult procedure has now been tested experimentally in open@xcite and closed systems.@xcite another seemingly simpler solution is to generate more statistics by varying an applied magnetic field ( taking care to measure at @xmath2-field steps larger than the conductance autocorrelation width @xmath3).@xcite    in order to test more thoroughly quantum manifestations of classical chaos in quantum dots in the tunneling regime we propose a different quantity to be investigated : the parametric conductance peak autocorrelation function .",
    "because it is not difficult to cover a parametric range which extends over several autocorrelation lengths , correlation functions need a small number of peaks and should be easy to obtain experimentally .",
    "moreover , correlators of a fixed eigenstate are also of theoretical interest .",
    "analytical calculations using random matrix theory beyond a perturbative approach seem to be very challenging .",
    "in addition , the nonuniversal scaling contains interesting information about the underlying classical dynamics . to put the parametric dependence in contact with physical quantities and develop a satisfactory theoretical treatment of nonuniversal scaling factors",
    ", one has to invoke semiclassical arguments . in this sense",
    "the study of the autocorrelator of conductance peaks is an example where semiclassical and random matrix theories complement each other in the understanding of mesoscopic phenomena .",
    "the first step towards the description of the main features of chaos in quantum dots is to consider the problem of electrons moving in a cavity .",
    "we assume that the coulomb interaction within the cavity can be taken into account in a self - consistent way , yielding noninteracting quasiparticles . as a result of extensive studies of two - dimensional ( 2d ) dynamical systems",
    ", one has learned that when the classical motion in the cavity is hyperbolic , the quantum spectrum and the wave functions exhibit certain universal features.@xcite throughout this paper we shall consider a statistical approach which is valid for chaotic systems and also works fairly well for systems whose phase space is predominantly chaotic.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : stochastic ] we present our analytical and numerical treatment based on random matrix theory ( rmt ) .",

    "there we conjecture that the semiclassical periodic orbit theory can be used to estimate the typical magnetic field scale of any correlator of a quantum dot in a realistic situation .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] with a discussion on how the presented results are robust with respect to dephasing effects and on possible experimental realizations .",

    "one of the basic tools to investigate the conductance in mesoscopic devices is the landauer - bttiker formula.@xcite for a two - lead geometry , where leads are denoted by @xmath4 ( left ) and @xmath5 ( right ) , the conductance @xmath6 is given by @xmath7 where the sum runs over the channels @xmath8 on the lead @xmath4 and the channels @xmath9 on the lead @xmath5 .",
    "the scattering matrix @xmath10 connects right and left channels and is evaluated at the energy @xmath11 and magnetic flux @xmath12 .",
    "the factor of 2 is due to spin degeneracy .    in the case of quantum dots in the tunneling regime",
    "this formula becomes particularly simple , since the @xmath13 matrix can be written as @xmath14 where the matrix elements @xmath15 give the probability amplitude of a state in channel @xmath16 to couple to the resonance @xmath17 in the dot .",
    "the total decay width is given by @xmath18 .",
    "we shall assume that the contribution of direct processes is very small and neglect the off - resonance term @xmath19 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : smatrix ] ) is a very good approximation to the @xmath13 matrix when the average decay width @xmath20 is much smaller than the mean spacing between resonant states @xmath21 .",
    "this is indeed the case for the isolated resonances observed in quantum dot experiments .",
    "( hereafter we use @xmath21 to denote the level spacing caused solely by single - particle states within the cavity , as opposed to the spacing between conductance peaks observed in the experiments . )",

    "the integration is done over the contact region between lead and cavity . a useful quantity for the forthcoming discussion is the partial decay width , defined as latexmath:[$\\gamma_{c\\nu } =    not contain barrier penetration factors .",
    "throughout this paper we will assume that penetration factors are channel independent and therefore will influence only the average decay width @xmath20 , but not its distribution .",
    "this approximation is certainly valid in the case of a single open channel in each lead , the case for which we specialize our analytical and numerical results . when the constrictions connecting leads to the cavity are smaller than one electron wavelength but the cross section in the leads is not , strong correlations among partial decay amplitudes at a fixed resonance exist.@xcite for this general situation it is still possible to incorporate different penetration factors and the effect of correlations into our results , although we do not believe that the final expressions could be cast in a simple analytical form .",
    "nevertheless , one would need to obtain all parameters either from the experiment , or from a satisfactory dynamical model that comprises both cavity and leads .",
    "finite - temperature averaging caused by the rounding of the fermi distribution can be done straightforwardly . in the limit @xmath30 the conductance peak corresponding to an _ on - resonance _ measurement",

    "in other words , @xmath34 . equation ( [ eq : peakcond ] )",
    "does not take into account thermal activation effects .",
    "however , one should have in mind that in the tunneling regime very small values of the partial decay widths may occur relatively close in energy to large ones .",
    "in addition to that , the single - particle spacing fluctuates and can reach values smaller than @xmath21 . as a result , even at low temperatures ( less than 100  mk ) a very short peak may be substantially influenced by neighboring resonances .",
    "this effect causes the conductance peak to cross over to a different regime , where the height becomes proportional to @xmath35 rather than @xmath36 ( even though the inequality @xmath37 is still approximately satisfied).@xcite we will avoid further consideration of this or any other similar effect by restricting our analysis to peaks whose heights have exclusively the characteristic @xmath36 behavior .    in",
    "what follows we are going to evaluate the autocorrelator of conductance peak heights in terms of an external parameter @xmath38 which acts on the system hamiltonian .",
    "( at this point we do not need to specify @xmath38 , which could be , for instance , a shape variable or a magnetic flux . ) in order to obtain the autocorrelator we use a statistical approach that shall be described in detail in the next subsection .",
    "unfortunately , a complete analytical solution for this problem is not yet available and presently seems to be a formidable task .",
    "therefore our analytical treatment is based on a perturbative expansion for small values of @xmath38 .",
    "we resort to numerical diagonalizations of large random matrices to conjecture the complete form of the autocorrelator for all other values of @xmath38 .",
    "we also derive an exact analytical expression for the joint probability distribution of conductance peak heights and their first parametric derivative .",
    "this distribution , besides being of theoretical interest by itself , can also be employed alternatively in the calculation of the small-@xmath38 asymptotic limit of the conductance peak correlator .    before proceeding ,",

    "whereas random matrix theory provides the universal form of the correlation function , the nonuniversal field scale can be understood in simple semiclassical terms : it is related to the average winding number per unit of time of periodic orbits bouncing between the confining walls of the quantum dot .",
    "this field scale is rather sensitive to the geometry of the dot and the fermi energy . to compare our analytical and numerical predictions against the experimental result",
    ", the magnetic flux through the dot has to be larger than one quantum unit of flux @xmath271 , but such that the cyclotron radius is much larger than the dot diameter .",

    "it is important to note that dephasing in the small quantum dot has to be kept low enough , namely , the dephasing length has to be larger than the system size . also , the parametric results presented for the gue case were illustrated in a dynamical model in which only the magnetic field was varied .",
