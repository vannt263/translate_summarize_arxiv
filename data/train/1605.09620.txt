    "a solution is also reachable by the ba inverse - scattering method @xcite . in the thermodynamic limit ( tl ) the imaginary part of its ba complex rapidities simplifies @xcite .",
    "the hubbard model was originally introduced as a toy model to study d - electrons in transition metals @xcite .",
    "it is possibly the most studied lattice system of correlated electrons .",
    "static properties such as the charge and spin stiffnesses of the 1d hubbard model under periodic boundary conditions can be determined from the use of the response of the energy eigenvalues to an external flux piercing the ring @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , one of the main challenges in the study of the 1d hubbard model properties is the calculation of dynamical correlation functions .",
    "its ba solution provides the exact spectrum of the energy eigenstates , yet it has been difficult to apply to the derivation of high - energy dynamical correlation functions .",

    "<S> the momentum , electronic density , spin density , and interaction dependences of the exponents that control the @xmath0-plane singular features of the @xmath1 one - electron spectral functions of the 1d hubbard model at finite magnetic field are studied . </S>",
    "<S> the usual half - filling concepts of one - electron lower hubbard band and upper hubbard band are defined for all electronic density and spin density values and the whole finite repulsion range in terms of the rotated electrons associated with the model bethe - ansatz solution . </S>",
    "<S> such rotated electrons are the link of the non - perturbative relation between the electrons and the pseudofermions . </S>",
    "<S> our results further clarify the microscopic processes through which the pseudofermion dynamical theory accounts for the @xmath2 one - electron matrix elements between the ground state and excited energy eigenstates . </S>"
