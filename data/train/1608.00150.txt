    "this irrationality condition on the lengths of the edges is equivalent to the set of lengths of all closed orbits in @xmath0 not being a uniformly discrete subset of @xmath13 .    for any pair of vertices @xmath14",
    ", we wish to describe the asymptotic behavior of the number of distinct paths which start at vertex @xmath4 and end at vertex @xmath5 , of length at most @xmath15 .",
    "denote by @xmath16 the corresponding counting function , that is @xmath17 it seems clear that for a strongly connected non trivial incommensurable graph , the number of distinct paths has exponential growth , with a growth rate a constant not depending on the origin or the terminus of the family of paths .",
    "we give an explicit formula for the exponential growth function corresponding to @xmath18 in terms of the graph matrix of @xmath0 .",
    "[ main result]let @xmath0 be an incommensurable graph and let @xmath8 be the graph matrix of @xmath0 .",
    "denote by @xmath19 the maximal real value for which the spectral radius of @xmath8 is equal to @xmath20 .",
    "then @xmath19 is a well defined positive real constant depending only on @xmath0 , and @xmath21 as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the entry - wise derivative of @xmath24 .",
    "the incommensurability assumption follows from the proof of lemma [ no other poles on re=00003dlambda ] bellow .",
    "the counting function can be written as @xmath25 where the summation is over all lengths @xmath26 for which there exists a path of length @xmath27 from vertex @xmath4 to vertex @xmath5 in the graph @xmath0 , the number of such distinct paths is denoted by @xmath28 and the function @xmath29 is the indicator function of the set @xmath30 .",
    "for all @xmath31 , the laplace transform of @xmath32 is @xmath33    in order to count paths from @xmath4 to @xmath5 which consist of exactly @xmath7 edges , we look at exponents which appear in the @xmath34 entry of the @xmath7-th power of @xmath8 , and summing over all powers we take all possible paths into account .",
    "the counting function @xmath35 can be expressed in terms of the graph matrix @xmath36 via the laplace transform @xmath37 it will be shown that the sum on the right converges absolutely for suitable values of @xmath38 , and so we can indeed change the order of summation and integration as done in the above equation .",
    "this gives rise to the explicit formula    @xmath39    the proof for the theorem follows from the following tauberian theorem due to wiener and ikehara ( see chapter 8.3 in @xcite ) :    ( wiener - ikehara ) let @xmath40 be a non negative and increasing function on @xmath41 .",
    "suppose that the laplace transform of @xmath42 , given by @xmath43 , converges for all @xmath38 with @xmath44 , and that there exists @xmath45 for which the function @xmath46 extends to a continuous function in the closed half - plane @xmath47 .",
    "then @xmath48 as @xmath22 .",
    "for the sake of clarity we first look at some examples :    [ exa : a , b]let @xmath0 be the graph with a single vertex and two loops of incommensurable lengths @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the associated graph matrix is @xmath51 and @xmath19 is the single real solution to the equation @xmath52 since there is only one vertex we have @xmath53 and only one counting function @xmath54 .",
    "the laplace transform is @xmath55 and it follows from theorem [ main result ] that @xmath56 this example corresponds to the following question : given tiles of lengths @xmath49 and @xmath50 , in how many different ways can you tile the interval @xmath57 $ ] for @xmath58 ?    [ exa : a , b , c , d]let g be a graph with two vertices and four edges as described by the following figure        incommensurablity translates here to the assumption that either @xmath59 or @xmath60 or @xmath61 .",
    "the graph matrix is @xmath62 and @xmath19 is the largest real solution to the equation @xmath63 we have @xmath64 and so , for example , the number @xmath65 of closed orbits on @xmath0 of length less than @xmath15 is given by @xmath66    consider a special case of example [ exa : a , b , c , d ] with @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "note that this is a cover of the graph given in example [ exa : a , b ] and that the function @xmath69 counts the number of paths over edges of length @xmath49 and @xmath50 without any restrictions .",
    "we should get the same result as in example [ exa : a , b ] and indeed    @xmath70    and so @xmath71 where @xmath19 and @xmath42 as described in example [ exa : a , b ] .",
    "we show that the constant @xmath19 as described in the statement of the theorem exists and that the functions @xmath72 satisfy the conditions for the laplace transform in the wiener - ikehara theorem with a simple pole at @xmath73 .",
    "we note that throughout the proof we use the classical theory of perron - frobenius regarding the leading eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector of primitive matrices , for which full statements and proofs can be found chapter xiii of @xcite .",
    "although some of the following results can be found in the literature , we include the full details for the sake of clarity .",
    "for @xmath78 the matrix @xmath75 is real , non negative and irreducible ( because the graph @xmath0 is strongly connected ) , and so by perron - frobenius there exists a dominant real eigenvalue @xmath79 of multiplicity @xmath20 corresponding to a positive eigenvector @xmath80 satisfying @xmath81      for all @xmath86 there exists @xmath79 which by perron - frobenius is a simple eigenvalue and is thus a simple zero of the characteristic polynomial of @xmath75 . as such it is differential in terms of the coefficients of this polynomial and",
    "so @xmath79 is differential in terms of the entries of @xmath75 , which are all differential functions of @xmath86 , that is @xmath79 is differential . for corresponding right and left positive eigenvectors @xmath87 the following formula holds ( see theorem 6.3.12 in @xcite ) @xmath88 since the eigenvectors are positive , and the entry - wise derivative of @xmath24 is strictly negative , we deduce that @xmath89 and in particular @xmath90 is monotone decreasing .",
    "recall that @xmath91 is the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the non trivial strongly connected graph @xmath0 and so @xmath92 . moreover , since all elements of @xmath75 tend to zero as @xmath86 tends to infinity , so does the perron - frobenius eigenvalue .",
    "therefore there exists a finite @xmath82 for which @xmath83 and @xmath85 for all @xmath84 .",
    "[ generating function convergence and formula]there exists a minimal @xmath93 such that @xmath94 converges for all @xmath74 with @xmath84 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath95 and so @xmath96 and the functions @xmath97 are analytic in @xmath84 .",
    "the lemma follows because for @xmath84 , as in lemma [ lem : lambda for with pf eigenval is 1 ] , the geometric sum @xmath98 converges , and by the inequality in lemma [ lem : inequality complex matrix dominated by real ] so does @xmath94 .",
    "first , recall that @xmath83 , and so @xmath20 is an eigenvalue of @xmath101 and @xmath102 by perron - frobenius , the rank of @xmath103 is @xmath104 and so there exists an invertible @xmath104 dimensional minor of @xmath103 .",
    "this shows that @xmath105 is not the zero matrix .    since @xmath106 for all @xmath107 we have @xmath108=0\\ ] ] and",
    "so @xmath109 is in the kernel of @xmath110 . by perron - frobenius",
    "this kernel is 1-dimensional and contains a positive vector @xmath111 , and so for all @xmath107 there exists @xmath112 such that @xmath113 putting @xmath114 we deduce that if the @xmath5-th column of @xmath115 is non zero , then in fact all its entries are non zero and have the same sign , because @xmath116 .",
    "a similar argument holds for the rows by looking at the transpose of @xmath115 , and so combining all the above we see that all entries of @xmath105 are non zero and of the same sign .",
    "we now show that the sign is positive .",
    "first , note that it is equal to the sign of @xmath117 , which by jacobi s formula is equal to the derivative of the characteristic polynomial of @xmath101 at @xmath118 : @xmath119 since @xmath20 is the largest root of the characteristic polynomial this derivative is positive , and so is the sign of all entries of @xmath105 .",
    "the point @xmath73 is a singular point of @xmath97 , because by the previous lemma the numerator @xmath120 is non zero while the denominator has a zero at @xmath19 .",
    "it thus enough to show that the zero of @xmath121 at @xmath19 is a simple one .",
    "the characteristic polynomial of @xmath8 is given by @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the perron - frobenius eigenvalue .",
    "therefore @xmath124 , and @xmath125 for @xmath126 in a small neighborhood of @xmath19 , and @xmath127 it follows from equation that the function @xmath128 has a simple zero at @xmath19 , and the same holds for the function @xmath121 .      for simplicity",
    "we assume that for every pair of vertices @xmath34 in the graph @xmath0 there is at most one edge from vertex @xmath4 to vertex @xmath5 .",
    "there is no loss of generality here because such graphs can be used to cover general multigraphs ( see section [ sec : examples ] for an example ) , and since the corresponding counting functions differ only by a multiplicative constant , so do their laplace transforms and the position of the poles is not changed .",
    "denote @xmath131 , and notice that under our assumption @xmath132 let @xmath133 be the positive eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath83 and define @xmath134 to be the following invertible matrix @xmath135 the matrix given by @xmath136 is a non negative , right stochastic matrix , that is , all its rows sum up to @xmath20 .",
    "indeed , since @xmath137 , it is clear that @xmath138 and that the sum of the elements of the @xmath4th row is @xmath139    let @xmath140 be the matrix with coefficients from @xmath141 raised to the power of @xmath38 , that is @xmath142 notice that @xmath143 that is @xmath144 and @xmath140 are similar , and in particular they have the same characteristic polynomial @xmath145 . recalling the definition of the characteristic polynomial and plugging @xmath118 we see that @xmath146 and so it is enough to show that @xmath147 for all @xmath129 .",
    "assume @xmath148 for some @xmath129 .",
    "so there exists a nonzero vector @xmath149 for which @xmath150 that is for all @xmath4 @xmath151 by the triangle inequality , for all @xmath4 @xmath152 and together with the equality @xmath153 this implies that @xmath154 assume @xmath155 for all @xmath5 , and notice that this means @xmath156 are points on a circle of radius @xmath157 .",
    "we have therefore that every @xmath158 , which is itself a point on the circle of radius @xmath157 , is a convex combination ( that is , a linear combination with positive coefficients all adding up to @xmath20 ) of points on that same circle .",
    "this is only possible of course if @xmath159 for all @xmath5 such that @xmath160 .",
    "now , for any closed orbit on the graph , let @xmath161 denote the corresponding sequence of edges .",
    "we get @xmath162 and so @xmath163 which gives @xmath164 but @xmath165 and so there exists some @xmath166 for which @xmath167 this hold for every closed orbit on the graph , which is a contradiction to our irrationality assumptions on the lengths of the closed orbits on our incommensurable graph @xmath0 .",
    "recall that @xmath169 and we have seen that @xmath170 has a simple pole at @xmath73 , and so @xmath171 finally , use jacobi s formula to obtain @xmath172 combining the above we get the desired formula for the residue at hand ."
