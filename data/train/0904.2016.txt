    "the optical and uv radiation from sources present during reionization is now present in the near - infrared with a small , but non - negligible , contribution to the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) .",
    "searches for this radiation based on absolute photometry have proven problematic due to confusion with the zodiacal foreground . instead of the absolute background , in cooray et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we proposed to develop a near - infrared sounding rocket experiment , ciber , to conduct a deep search for extragalactic background fluctuations from the epoch of reionization associated with first - light galaxies .",
    "the ebl spectrum contains all radiative information from the reionization epoch ( santos et al .",
    "2003 ; kashlinsky et al .",
    "2004 ; fernandez & komatsu 2006 ; cooray et al .",
    "we expect that the ebl contains diffuse signatures of reionization , such as ly-@xmath0 background radiation redshifted to near - ir wavelengths today .",
    "remnants of these first stars , black holes in the form of miniquasars will also contribute to the ebl ( cooray & yoshida 2004 ) .",
    "interestingly , integrated individual galaxy counts appear to fall short of the ebl measured with absolute photometry at near - infrared wavelengths ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "for instance in the 1 - 3 @xmath1 m band , galaxies contribute an intensity of @xmath210 nw / m@xmath3 sr ( madau & pozzetti 2000 ) .",
    "in contrast , the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) measured by dirbe and the irts at the same wavelengths ranges from 10 nw / m@xmath3 sr at 3.6 @xmath1 m ( levenson & wright 2008 ) to up to 60 nw / m@xmath3sr at 1.2 @xmath1 m ( cambresy et al .",
    "2001 ; matsumoto et al .",
    "it is highly unlikely that this whole difference is associated with sources during reionization , since such a large intensity requires unphysical requirements on starformation ( madau & silk 2005 ) .",
    "though the total luminosity produced by sources responsible for reionization is uncertain , a lower limit can be placed assuming a minimal number of photons to produce and maintain reionization , given existing information on reionization , rest - frame uv luminosity functions of galaxies at @xmath4 , stellar mass estimates for galaxies at @xmath5 , among others ( chary & cooray 2009 ) .",
    "such ` minimal ' reionization scenarios produce an ebl @xmath2 1 nw / m@xmath3 sr , a level undetectable by current absolute photometry measurements which , after dedicated space - borne measurements , show large discrepancies . as the spectral signature in ebl from reionization contains integrated emission from all sources , including fainter ones undetectable with jwst , it captures the exact reionization history and provides more information than other known probes of reionization , including cmb and 21-cm background .",
    "this spectral feature could be resolved in the future with absolute photometric measurements in narrow spectral bands between 1 - 2 @xmath1 m with an out - of - zodi ebl explorer at distances around 5 au ( cooray et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "even in the relatively recent times since reionization it appears there may be an under accounting of galaxies . the current star - formation in lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) at z @xmath2 6 ( bouwens et al .",
    "2006 ) falls about a factor of 6 to 9 below the minimum required to maintain an ionized igm given canonical estimates for the clumping factor of the gas and the escape fraction of ionizing photons from galaxies .",
    "the upper limits on the ultraviolet luminosity function suggests a negative evolution with increasing redshift , in the sense that galaxies at the bright end of the uv luminosity function at z @xmath2 6 were fainter in the ultraviolet .",
    "the implication is that the contribution from star - formation in faint galaxies , below the detection threshold of current surveys , is higher than has been estimated .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "stellar mass estimates suggest a to - heavy imf for high redshift galaxies ( chary 2008 ) , suggesting a different stellar population in those galaxies than in the local universe . if current galaxy surveys under account for galaxy evolution or miss populations , the deficit may be uncovered in a careful study of the ebl .",
    "a first - light galaxy ebl component from reionization and any contribution from faint sources at @xmath6 unresolved by existing deep , pencil surveys can be uncovered using a careful study of background fluctuations ( cooray et al .",
    "the technique involves the measurement of the angular power spectrum via an anisotropy study , similar in method to well - established techniques for studying cmb anisotropy .",
    "first - light galaxies have predictable clustering , determined by the growth of dark matter perturbations in @xmath7cdm cosmology , and will produce ebl fluctuations with a characteristic spatial power spectrum .",
    "zodiacal light is known to be spatially uniform on arcminute scales .",
    "what is uncertain is the amplitude of fluctuations since it depends on the astrophysics of reionization and the importance of , say , fainter sources at @xmath6 to 8 that are responsible for maintaining reionization .",
    "a fluctuation measurement has the potential to detect a first - light galaxy component to the ebl at much fainter levels than can be probed with absolute photometry .    since our work on ciber began ( cooray et al .",
    "2004 ; bock et al .",
    "2006 ) , _ spitzer _ irac has carried out a study of ebl clustering anisotropy . after a deep removal of both point sources , and deconvolving emission from the extended psf , kashlinsky et al .",
    "( 2005 ; 2007 ) claim detection of first - light galaxy fluctuations based on a deviation from a shot - noise power spectrum on the largest angular scales .",
    "some doubt may be cast on the interpretation of first sources due to the angular scales and wavelengths covered by irac .",
    "due to irac s small field of view , the power spectrum from high - z objects must be carefully separated from fainter , unresolved foreground galaxies ( cooray et al .",
    "2007 ; chary et al . 2008 ) .",
    "in addition , fluctuation measurements have been made at shorter near - ir wavelengths in narrow , but very deep , nicmos images ( thompson et al .",
    "the images again show a fluctuation signal ( fig  2 ) .",
    "the spectrum of fluctuations measured between _ spitzer _",
    "irac and hst nicmos appears to be approximately flat , and the authors state it does not correspond to the shape expected for @xmath8 sources ( thompson et al .",
    "2007 ) , but rather to a low redshift population unresolved in both _ spitzer _ and hst .",
    "considering the difficulty of the measurement , we believe the amplitude between nicmos and _ spitzer _ is quite uncertain .",
    "we also note that narrow fields such as goods and nicmos udf are affected by cosmic variance , especially at @xmath4 , where the correlation length of halos responsible for reionization is greater than the field size .",
    "these caveats do not rule out the possibility that the _ spitzer _ fluctuations , at least at some fractional level , reveal a first - light component .",
    "the initial results are clearly exciting , have important implications on galaxy formation , but ir background fluctuations must be further studied at shorter wavelengths , where the signatures from reionization are expected to dominate .",
    "the ciber instrument currently consists of two wide - field imagers to measure ebl fluctuations , a low - resolution spectrometer ( lrs ) to probe the ebl via absolute photometry , and a narrow - band spectrometer ( nbs ) , to measure the brightness of the zodiacal by the ca - ii 854.2 fraunhofer line ( bock et al .",
    "two imaging cameras operate at 0.9 and 1.6 @xmath1 m and probe ebl fluctuations over a wide 4 sqr .",
    "degree field of view , allowing measurements over the distinctive peak in the power spectrum at @xmath9 ( 0.1 degrees ) .    with the nbs",
    ", ciber will also test the large ebl intensity ( @xmath2 50 nw / m@xmath3 sr ) reported by dirbe and irts .",
    "the measurement is not limited by the sensitivity of the instruments , but primarily by the zodiacal foreground and to a less extent by the astrophysical systematic errors in removing stars and scattered starlight , expected to be @xmath2 2% of the zodiacal brightness .    as the residual ebl spectrum closely resembles that of zodiacal light ( dwek et al . 2005 )",
    ", there is the possibility of a large @xmath2 25% error in the zodi model used by both dirbe and irts teams .",
    "the nbs has sufficient sensitivity and systematic error control to precisely measure the zodiacal amplitude at 854.2 nm .",
    "this measurement can be extrapolated to the dirbe 1.2 and 2.2 @xmath1 m bands based on the zodiacal spectrum measured by the lrs .",
    "ciber - i has a second planned flight in early 2010 .",
    "we also propose several additional flights to observe multiple lines of sight through the zodiacal cloud , measured between a span of 6 months , to vary the solar elongation angle .",
    "the observation windows are carefully chosen so these fields are within the dirbe observations at the same time of year . if the dirbe models are incorrect at the 20% level , this should become readily apparent , and the multiple observations are necessary to help us understand how the zodi models should be corrected .",
    "ciber - i was first launched from white sands missile range in new mexico on a terrier - black brant sounding rocket on february 25th , 2009 . the vehicle performed as expected , and the payload achieved an apogee of 320 km .",
    "all flight events went according to plan and we hope to release our first science results within a year .",
    "these are expected to be on a first measurement of the ebl between 1 - 2@xmath1 m with ciber and on a fluctuation analysis to test the claims of kashlinsky et al .",
    "( 2007 ) at shorter near - ir wavelengths .",
    "after the planned flight 2010 and subsequent proposed flights with ciber - i are completed , we plan a more capable camera designed to probe fluctuations down to the low level of minimal reionization fluctuations , with a factor of @xmath10 improvement in sensitivity compared to that of ciber - i ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "the ciber - ii camera consists of a 30 cm telescope operating simultaneously in four bands between 0.5 and 2.1 @xmath1 m with each imaging the same 2 sqr .",
    "degree field of view .",
    "the four bands are matched to identify the spectral dependence of the reionization contribution from foreground and zodiacal fluctuations .",
    "as the case with ciber - i , ciber - ii will image wide fields with existing deep coverage in optical and near - ir with _",
    "spitzer _ and ground - based instruments .",
    "the cameras are designed for high sensitivity to surface brightness in the short amount of time available during a sounding rocket flight . in comparison with space - borne telescopes , ciber - ii measures fluctuations on large angular scales , on both sides of the expected peak in the power spectrum .",
    "these are also the angular scales best suited for distinguishing this signal from local galaxies , and systematic effects due to its distinctive power spectrum . by measuring large angular scales ,",
    "potential problems with source removal are less serious than in a small deep measurement .",
    "ciber - ii is designed to have a very large instrumental fov , the figure of merit relevant for measuring surface brightness , with required raw sensitivity even in a short sounding rocket flight compared with the long integrations possible on a satellite .",
    "it is expected that ciber - ii will carry out the definitive study to establish the surface density of sources responsible for reionization and its results will complement number counts at @xmath4 from jwst , especially at the bright end , to put a complete picture of reionization together ."
