    "<S> in @xcite we constructed a compact topological space for the combinatorics of `` a regular pentagonal tiling of the plane '' , which we call the continuous hull . </S>",
    "<S> we also constructed a substitution map on the space which turns out to be a homeomorphism , and so the pair given by the continuous hull and the substitution map yields a dynamical system . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show how we can write this dynamical system as another dynamical system given by an inverse limit and a right shift map .    </S>",
    "<S> [ multiblock footnote omitted ]        for an aperiodic flc euclidean substitution tiling of the plane , there is a recipe for writing its continuous hull as an inverse limit . </S>",
    "<S> see for instance @xcite , @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such recipe consists of the following two steps : ( 1 ) if necessary , write the substitution map as one that `` forces its border '' with a so - called collared substitution . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) construct an equivalence relation on the continuous hull so that the continuous hull modulo this equivalence relation is a finite cw - complex , which is also known as the anderson - putnam finite cw - complex . </S>",
    "<S> the inverse system consists of repeatedly using the same object , namely the anderson - putnam finite cw - complex , and a morphism , namely a continuous surjective map induced by the quotient and substitution map . + in @xcite we defined the continuous hull @xmath0 for the combinatorics @xmath1 of `` a regular pentagonal tiling of the plane '' as    [ cols= \" > , < \" , ]      +   + however </S>",
    "<S> , the cases @xmath2 in rows 3,7,11,15,19 can not occur because that would imply that the 3-degree decorations 125 , 123 , 145 , 234 , 345 are decorations of @xmath1 , which are not by lemma 1.27 in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the number of exterior decorations that pattern ( 2 ) gives are at most @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> pattern ( 1 ) gives only one new exterior decoration , which is @xmath4 since all these exterior decorations occur in @xmath5 , the collared tiles are @xmath6 .    by lemma 1.27 in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> the possible collared edges are of the form shown in figure [ f : edgescabelon ] .    . </S>",
    "<S> the dots mean that we might have 3- or 4- degree vertices.,title=\"fig : \" ] +     on a collared tile . </S>",
    "<S> , title=\"fig : \" ] +    reading the collared edges from our 36 collared pentagons , we get 45 collared edges , and this is of course under the observation that @xmath7 can also be written as @xmath8 , and if @xmath9 then we can swap the values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to notice that 18 collared edges start with @xmath12 , where @xmath13 .    </S>",
    "<S> reading the collared vertices from our 45 collared edges , we get 10 collared vertices , which are precisely the ten decorated vertices given by lemma 1.27 in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> [ d : collaredsubsoncollaredtile ] let @xmath14 be the collared tiles of @xmath1 listed in table [ t : collaredtiles ] . </S>",
    "<S> the collared substitution @xmath15 on a collared tile @xmath16 is defined as in the following list , which is read from figure [ f : collaredsubstitution ] .    </S>",
