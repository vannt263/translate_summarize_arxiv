    "@xmath73 in the vertices , boson propagators are convoluted as @xmath74 , fermion propagators as @xmath75 , and then these convolutions are multiplied . as a result of this , the bosonic part of each diagram decouples completely from the fermionic part .",

    "usually , a feynman diagram is a mnemonic representing a certain contribution to a term in a series expansion , i.e. a label .",
    "we will use the same drawing for the contribution itself , apart of the symmetry factor of the diagram .",
    "for example , the contribution of the diagram @xmath78 is equal to @xmath79 and its symmetry factor is equal to @xmath80 , so that we write @xmath81      the contribution to the zeroth order in @xmath0 can only come from diagrams in which the power of @xmath0 coming from the vertices cancels the power of @xmath1 , coming from the fermion loops .",
    "this only happens in diagrams with vertices with two bosonic legs only , and in which the fermion lines begin and end on the same vertex . to write down their contribution",

    "as we have seen before , bosonic two - point vertices with a closed single fermion line contribute with a factor @xmath90 , and without any dependence on @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , it is useful to introduce the following effective vertex @xmath91 and the following _ dressed _ boson propagator @xmath92 if we assume that the basis is orthonormal in the landau gauge , we can write @xmath93 which is , apart of a factor @xmath90 , the same expression as in eq .  ( 67 ) in @xcite .",

    "such diagrams we call _ one - vertex reducible _ , and discrepancies with this property we call _ one - vertex decomposable_. examples of such discrepancies are those for which @xmath55 is translation invariant , i.e. , @xmath109 @xmath110 , such as the fourier diaphony . also the lego discrepancy with equal bins is one - vertex decomposable .",
