    "previous near - infrared ( jhk bands ) spectroscopic observations of individual or small selected samples of giant stars have been limited in scope and mostly biased towards the brightest sources .",
    "this has prevented the study of the chemical abundance patterns in unbiased samples of stars towards the inner ( and dusty ) parts ( e.g. , galactic bulge and center ) of our galaxy , significantly hampering progress towards a full understanding of the formation and chemical ( and dynamical ) evolution of the milky way .",
    "this unfortunate situation has dramatically changed in the new era of massive high - resolution spectroscopic surveys . in particular , the apache point observatory galactic evolution experiment ( apogee ) has focused on collecting high - resolution and high - quality h@xmath2band spectra for a large ( @xmath1 10@xmath12 stars ) sample of giant stars , with access to the inner - and more extinguished - regions of our galaxy .",

    "we describe two h@xmath2band stellar spectral libraries developed for the sdss  iii apogee survey , based on atlas9 and marcs model atmospheres and computed with the ass@xmath5 t and turbospectrum spectral synthesis codes , respectively .",
    "all marcs / turbospectrum computations were performed on the condor cluster at the instituto de astrofsica de canarias ( iac ) .",
    "condor ( or htcondor ) is a high throughput computing ( htc ) system developed by the university of wisconsin - madison ( uw - madison ) . in the case of the iac , condor consists of a computer cluster with 808 cpus . on the other hand ,",
    "the atlas9/ass@xmath5 t calculations were performed on the clusters stampede and maverick operated by the texas advanced computing center ( tacc ) .",
    "it is to be noted here that the atlas9 and marcs model atmospheres do not include the line opacity for the polyatomic carbon molecules c@xmath21h@xmath21 and c@xmath22 ( mszros et al . 2012 ) .",
    "these molecules are known to dominate the infrared spectra of cool ( @xmath4 @xmath23 4000 k ) carbon stars with c / o @xmath1 1.0 , strongly affecting their thermal atmospheric structure .",
    "thus , at present the atlas9/ass@xmath5 t and marcs / turbospectrum synthetic spectra with @xmath4 @xmath23 3500@xmath24000 k and c / o @xmath1 1.0 are not reliable ( see section 6 ) .",
    "the apogee atlas9/ass@xmath5 t spectral library makes use of the new atlas9 grid of model atmospheres presented in mszros et al .",
    "atlas9 model atmospheres ( kurucz 1993 ) are one - dimensional plane - parallel models computed in lte and using opacity distribution functions ( odfs ) to handle line opacity ( see e.g. , kurucz 2005 ) .",
    "the mixing - length scheme for convective energy transport is adopted , and the kurucz atomic and molecular line lists are used ( see mszros et al .",
    "2012 for more details ) .",
    "the new atlas9 model atmospheres are based on the recent solar composition by asplund et al .",
    "this has the advantage of matching the solar composition adopted also in the construction of the marcs models described in the next section .",
    "mszros et al .",
    "( 2012 ) carried out new odfs and rosseland mean opacity calculations for several microturbulent velocities ( @xmath9 = 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 km  s@xmath10 ) , but all the apogee atlas9 model atmospheres are computed with @xmath9 = 2 km  s@xmath10 .    for the purpose of building the libraries , we divided the atlas9 model atmospheres into two grids ( gk and f ) depending on the effective temperature ( @xmath4 ) , with the gk- and f - classes covering the 3500@xmath26500 k and 5500@xmath28000 k @xmath4 ranges , respectively .",
    "it is important to note that missing ( non - converged ) atlas9 model atmospheres are substituted by the nearest model in chemical space at the same @xmath4 and log @xmath8 .",
    "the non - converged atlas9 model atmospheres were a total of 6217 structures , most of them corresponding to cool high surface gravity models ( @xmath4 @xmath23 4000 k and log  @xmath8 @xmath1 4.0 ) and cool c - rich models ( @xmath4 @xmath23 4000 k and c / o @xmath1 0.75 ) .",
    "most stars targeted by sdss ",
    "iii apogee are red giant and dwarf candidates , which makes the atlas9 gk - class model grid the most important for apogee .",
    "the atlas9 gk - class models cover eleven @xmath4 and eleven log @xmath8 values ( from 3500 to 6000 k in steps of 250 k and from 0 to 5 dex in steps of 0.5 dex , respectively ) , seven metallicities [ m / h ] accounts for all elements with atom number z @xmath1 2 and [ m / h ] = @xmath24 , where n@xmath25 and n@xmath19 are the number density of any z @xmath1 2 element and hydrogen nuclei , respectively . for the construction of the synthetic spectral libraries , all metals other than c ,",
    "n , and @xmath26elements are scaled with the corresponding [ m / h ] value . ] ( from @xmath22.5 to @xmath70.5 dex in steps of 0.5 dex ) , and 81 values for the abundance of c and the @xmath11-elements ( [ c / m ] and [ @xmath11/m ] from @xmath21.0 to @xmath71.0 dex in steps of 0.25 dex ) .",
    "the @xmath11-elements in the atlas9 models are as in the introduction .",
    "thus , 68,607 gk - class atlas9 models are present in the gk atlas9 apogee grid used to produce the atlas9/ass@xmath5 t spectral library .",
    "the atlas9 f - class grid is used for the analysis of a much smaller number of warmer stars such as the telluric line standards observed by the sdss ",
    "iii apogee survey .",
    "the f - class atlas9-apogee grid contains also 68,607 model atmospheres that cover @xmath4 values from 5500 k to 8000 k ( in steps of 250 k ) and the same [ m / h ] , [ c / m ] , and [ @xmath11/m ] ranges as the gk - class one .",
    "the code ass@xmath5 t was used to compute synthetic spectra for the kurucz atlas9 models .",
    "t was originally written for calculating spectra for 3d hydrodynamical simulations , and later a 1d branch was developed for dealing with large numbers of classical hydrostatic model atmospheres .",
    "the code has an option to pre - calculate the opacity as a function of temperature and a second thermodynamical quantity ( density or electron density ) on a grid covering the range of the models of interest , interpolating on - the - fly for solving the radiative transfer equation .",
    "opacity interpolations were avoided in the calculations described above in order to maximize accuracy .",
    "ass@xmath5 t adopts the same software package used by synspec / tlusty ( hubeny & lanz 1995 ; hubeny 2006 ) for computing opacities , and the input data described by allende prieto ( 2008 ) .",
    "continuum opacities are mainly from the opacity project ( cunto et al .",
    "1993 ) and the iron project ( nahar 1995 ; bautista 1997 ) , and line opacities are shared in the calculations described in this paper for turbospectrum / marcs .",
    "the opacities used in ass@xmath5 t are largely independent from those in kurucz model atmospheres , especially in the case of continuum ( bound - free and free - free ) opacity .",
    "we have , nevertheless , checked that the absolute fluxes predicted in the optical and near - infrared are fairly similar for ass@xmath5 t and atlas9 for a solar - like star , where h@xmath27 dominates the continuum opacity ( as for most apogee targets ) , while in the near - uv the differences become larger due to different photoionization cross - sections for metals ( mainly iron , but also magnesium and other atoms ) .",
    "the overall equation of state is also similar for the two codes , since when chemical equilibrium calculations are performed in ass@xmath5 t , the final electron density for solar - like stars is consistent with the original from the atlas9 model at a level of a few percent . in all the atlas9 dr12 grids the electron density was iterated in ass@xmath5 t to be consistent with the atomic and molecular species considered in the synthesis .",
    "the calculations for a few models with extreme compositions did result in iterated electron densities that shifted the @xmath28 layer outside of the atlas9 structure .",
    "t is set to stop when that occurs , so those calculations were successfully completed relaxing that limit to @xmath29 .",
    "the atlas9 apogee gk- and f - class model atmosphere grids mentioned above are used in conjunction with the dr12 atomic / molecular line lists ( linelist 201312161124 ; shetrone et al .",
    "2015 ) to compute atlas9/ass@xmath5 t synthetic spectra with five microturbulence values ( @xmath9 = 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 km  s@xmath10 ) , five n abundances ( [ n / m ] from @xmath21.0 to @xmath71.0 dex in steps of 0.5 dex ) , and the solar c isotopic ratio ( @xmath30c/@xmath31c=89 ) .",
    "thus , in the end the gk- and f - class atlas9/ass@xmath5 t grids contain seven dimensions ( 7d ; @xmath4 , log @xmath8 , @xmath9 , [ m / h ] , [ c / m ] , [ n / m ] , and [ @xmath11/m ] ) and the same number ( 1,715,175 ) of total synthetic spectra .",
    "the model parameters for the atlas9/ass@xmath5 t stellar spectral libraries are summarized in table 1 .",
    "finally , the synthetic spectra are smoothed to the apogee resolution , continuum - normalized , re - sampled , and transformed to vacuum wavelengths .",
    "the atlas9/ass@xmath5 t spectral libraries are then compressed using principal component analysis method ( pca , pearson 1901 ) to prepare it for use by aspcap ( see garca prez et al . 2015 for further details ) .",
    "we note that the line spread function ( lsf ) for the atlas9/ass@xmath5 t dr12 spectral library is a combo of those derived from several apogee fibers ; actually an average of five fibers lsfs characterized with a gauss - hermite function of variable resolution with wavelength ( see also garca prez et al .",
    "2015 for further details ) .",
    "however , to make a fair comparison with the other spectral libraries treated in this paper and to avoid also systematic effects , we are using an atlas9/ass@xmath5 t spectral library version that has been smoothed with a gaussian kernel to the apogee spectral resolution ( @xmath32 = 22,500 ) , as the marcs / turbospectrum one .",
    "the apogee marcs / turbospectrum spectral library is based on the most recent marcs model atmospheres ( gustafsson et al .",
    "basically , marcs model atmospheres are one - dimensional models in hydrostatic equilibrium that are calculated in lte and adopting the mixing - length theory for convection ( henyey et al .",
    "the marcs models are spherical for surface gravities log @xmath8 @xmath6 3 , while they are plane - parallel at higher gravities ( appropriate for dwarf stars ; see gustafsson et al .",

    "( [ c / m ] and [ @xmath11/m ] from @xmath21.0 to @xmath71.0 dex in steps of 0.5 dex ) are present in the marcs - apogee grid used to construct the corresponding marcs / turbospectrum spectral library .",
    "this results in a grid of @xmath017,325 marcs models ; 1,062 models , however , do not converge and are therefore missing in the marcs - apogee grid .",
    "these non - converged marcs model atmosphere structures are replaced with the nearest model in chemical space at the same @xmath4 and log @xmath8 ( see below ) .",
    "synthetic spectra in the apogee spectral range were generated with the turbospectrum package ( alvarez & plez 1998 ; plez 2012 ) , which shares the same input data and radiative transfer routines with marcs ( gustafsson et al .",
    "turbospectrum is a 1d lte spectral synthesis code that accounts for 600 molecules and uses the treatment of collisional line broadening described by anstee & omara ( 1995 ) and barklem et al .",
    "it allows the computation of flux ( or intensity ) synthetic spectra for stars of spectral type f and cooler .",
    "we used version 13.1 of turbospectrum but modified by us to use van der waals broadening ( the barklem treatment was used when possible , otherwise we used van der waals constants from kurucz ; see shetrone et al .",
    "2015 for more details ) for the atomic lines .",
    "the synthetic spectra are computed for an array of standard air wavelengths with a wavelength step of 0.03  . by using the marcs - apogee grid ( see above ) and the dr12 atomic / molecular line lists ( shetrone et al .",
    "2015 ) as input in turbospectrum , we constructed marcs / turbospectrum synthetic spectra with microturbulent velocities of @xmath9 = 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 km  s@xmath10 and with varying n content ( [ n / m ] from @xmath21.0 to @xmath71.0 in steps of 0.5 dex ) and solar @xmath30c/@xmath31c ratio .",
    "this resulted in a marcs / turbospectrum grid with seven dimensions ( 7d ; @xmath4 , log @xmath8 , @xmath9 , [ m / h ] , [ c / m ] , [ n / m ] , and [ @xmath11/m ] ) containing @xmath0 43,375 synthetic spectra ; the model parameters for the marcs / turbospectrum stellar spectral library are also given in table 1 .",
    "it is to be noted here that in some cases ( @xmath0100 ) the spectral synthesis does not converge .",
    "however , these mainly correspond to the most extreme and unrealistic abundance patterns ( e.g. , very high or very low @xmath11 element abundances ) . as in the case of the missing marcs model atmospheres mentioned above , we also replace the missing synthetic spectra ( fluxes ) with the ones at the same @xmath4 and log @xmath8 and with the nearest chemical composition . finally , the marcs / turbospectrum synthetic spectra are processed ( i.e. , smoothed , continuum - normalized , etc . ) and pca - compressed in the same way as the atlas9/ass@xmath5 t library .",
    "in this section we compare the gaussian smoothed gk - atlas9/ass@xmath5 t and the k - marcs / turbospectrum spectral libraries , which since these grids overlap in atmospheric parameters in the range 35005500 k.    such comparisons can give indications on the uncertainties due to the use of different model atmospheres , different spectral synthesis codes , as well as partly different input data , with only the line lists being the same . it also allows to check the possible influence of sphericity effects in the synthetic spectra ( sect .",
