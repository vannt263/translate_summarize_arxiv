    "for massive elliptical galaxies and galaxies with classical bulges , black hole ( bh ) masses have been found to correlate with various properties of bulge , such as bulge mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , bulge luminosity ( the @xmath2relation , see @xcite ) , and the velocity dispersion of stars in the bulge ( the @xmath6  relation , see @xcite ) .",
    "this has led to theoretical work exploring the importance of agn feedback on galaxy evolution and the creation of the scaling relations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , we still do not understand the origin of the scaling relations .",
    "observationally , they are best - measured using nearby elliptical galaxies with central supermassive bhs having masses @xmath7 .",
    "it is still unclear what the scaling relations look like for bhs with masses @xmath8 in late - type galaxies .",
    "some simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that the @xmath6relation can result from the the hierarchical merging of massive dark matter halos ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in that picture , and assuming massive bh seeds ( @xmath9 ) , the @xmath6  relation would flatten at the low - mass end .",
    "measurement of the scaling relations of low - mass bhs will directly constrain models of bh seed formation and help elucidate the most important factors in establishing the observed scaling relations .",

    "@xcite ) , @xcite study the @xmath2  relation at low mass and find a different scaling , with bhs living in larger bulges than expected from the high - mass relations .",
    "however , their sample is small and the result is quite uncertain .",
    "@xcite present 174 low - mass bhs from dr4 of the sdss , giving us the opportunity to study the scaling relations with an order of magnitude more objects .",
    "their @xmath6  relation has been examined by @xcite .",
    "we have done detailed image decompositions of these galaxies based on _ hst _ imaging ( * ? ? ? * hereafter paper i ) and the @xmath2  relation will be studied here .",
    "low - mass bhs are found in different host galaxy types than more massive bhs .",
    "most of their host galaxies actually contain pseudobulges .",
    "pseudobulges have quite different properties from those of violently and rapidly formed classical bulges . for example , pseudobulges have flatter shapes than those of classical bulges ( e.g. , srsic index @xmath11 ) .",
    "they have smaller velocity dispersions at fixed luminosity in the faber - jackson relation @xcite compared with classical bulges ( e.g. , @xcite ; paper i ) .",
    "pseudobulges are believed to form via secular processes in disk galaxies ( see the review by @xcite )",
    ". considering their differing formation mechanisms and properties , we may expect differing bh scaling relations as well , which is observed with small samples with dynamical bh masses ( e.g. , @xcite ) and indirect analysis ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as the bulges hosting the low - mass bhs presented here are likely dominated by pseudobulges ( paper i ) ,",
    "studying the properties of these galaxies will also help us understand the growth and evolution of pseudobulges .",
    "the sample and observations are described in @xcite and paper i. here we briefly describe the key properties of the sample for completeness .",
    "the 174 galaxies are selected from dr4 of the sdss ( @xcite ) to have virial bh masses @xmath12 .",
    "they have a median redshift of 0.085 and a median @xmath4 of @xmath13 .",
    "the host galaxy structures and luminosities are derived from a snapshot survey with wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on _ hst _ in cycle 16 . with the planetary camera ( pc )",
    ", we achieve a resolution of @xmath14 per pixel and a field of view of @xmath15 .",
    "the observations are done with the f814w filter ( mean wavelength of @xmath16 ) , which we refer to as the @xmath1-band in the following . for each object",
    "we obtain a short ( 30 sec ) exposure in case of saturation , followed by two dithered @xmath17 sec exposures .",
    "images are reduced following standard procedures , with extra care taken to remove cosmic ray trails ( see paper i for details ) .      for massive bhs in the nearby universe ,",
    "the most reliable bh masses are based on dynamical tracers such as stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or water masers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , current instrumentation lacks the spatial resolution to obtain dynamical measurements for such low - mass bhs outside the local group .",
    "thus , we use virial bh masses measured from active galactic nucleus ( agn ) emission lines .",
    "reverberation mapping @xcite provides sizes for the broad - line regions ( blrs ) of a few dozen agns , from which a relation between blr size and agn luminosity is calibrated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "then the virial mass is simply @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a dimensionless factor that accounts for the unknown geometry of the blr , @xmath20 is the size of blr and @xmath21 is some measure of the width of the broad - line width such as full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) . in practice ,",
    "the width and luminosity of the broad h@xmath22 emission line @xcite are used to estimate the virial bh masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "despite the large uncertainty in virial masses , it has been demonstrated that the virial masses of smbhs are in good agreement with masses determined based on the @xmath6  relation ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the uncertainty in the virial masses is thought to be a factor of @xmath23 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we adopt a single value of @xmath24 , which is intended to represent an ensemble average over our sample and to be consistent with other people s work ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we use detailed image decomposition to isolate the bulge component in the @xmath1-band images .",
    "following @xcite , we perform full two - dimensional fitting with galfit ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "details about the fitting and the best - fitting models for our sample are given in paper i. here we briefly describe the basic elements .",
    "a point - spread function ( psf ) model from tinytim @xcite is used to model the agn component . for other components of the host galaxies ,",
    "we use a generalized srsic @xcite model to fit the light .",
    "we fix the srsic index @xmath25 to be @xmath26 so that galfit will not converge on an unreasonably high @xmath25 value . if necessary , a bar is also included as an @xmath27 srsic component .",
    "the sky is fitted using a variety of methods , in order to estimate parameter uncertainties due to the sky level . also , we use alternate psf models to bracket the uncertainties due to errors in the psf model .",
    "the values of the bulge luminosities and uncertainties for our sample are given in table 2 of paper i.      in paper 1 we present evidence that the majority of the disk galaxies in our sample likely contain pseudobulges , as summarized here .",
    "of the galaxies with reliable srsic index @xmath25 measurements , @xmath28 have @xmath11 .",
    "extended disks are found in @xmath29 of galaxies , while bar structures are identified in @xmath30 of the sample . about half of the galaxies",

    "all of our disk galaxies satisfy the relations for pseudobulges given by @xcite .",
    "based on these properties , and their fundamental plane scalings , we argue that the disk galaxies predominantly have pseudobulges , and that the galaxies without disks are bright spheroidal , rather than elliptical , galaxies @xcite .",

    "both calculations show that the galaxies in our sample have systematically smaller bh masses at a fixed bulge mass compared with the sample of bentz et al .",
    "differences in stellar populations , which we estimate would dim our bulges by @xmath67 mag ( paper i ) , are not sufficient to explain these discrepancies .    to investigate further whether these differences represent a real physical difference ( e.g. , as a function of mass )",
    ", we also compare to inactive bhs with dynamical bh masses from @xcite .",

    ", the intrinsic scatter increases significantly ( see table [ fittingresult ] ) . this scatter is driven by a systematic shift between our sample and the gltekin et al . sample . for a given bh mass ,",
    "our galaxies have larger bulge luminosities .",
    "this shift may be real , or it may be explained by younger stars , and thus lower mass - to - light ratios , in our sample galaxies ( paper i ) . in order to investigate the magnitude of this uncertainty , we estimate dynamical masses @xmath71 for a subset of our sample , as described below . dynamical mass should be a good approximation of the stellar mass of the bulge @xmath72 , since in general stars should dominate the gravitational potential on the scale of the bulge .",
    "dynamical masses for the bulges are estimated as @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the effective radius and @xmath75 is the velocity dispersion of the bulge ( paper i ) .",
    "here we use a prefactor of @xmath76 to be consistent with @xcite and @xcite .",

    "this offset is significantly larger than any reasonable formal uncertainty in the virial bh masses ( @xmath79 dex ) .",
    "furthermore , even after correcting for stellar populations , our sample follows a steeper relation between @xmath4 and @xmath80 than the inactive ellipticals taken alone ( table [ fittingrelation ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with our observed faber - jackson relation in paper i ( figure 9 ) , in that at a fixed bulge magnitude , pesudobulges have smaller stellar velocity dispersions .    when a dark matter halo is included , the prefactor in the formula for dynamical mass decreases by @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite show that the normalization of dynamical mass formula for bulges with srsic index @xmath82 ( as is the case for our sample of predominantly pseudobulges ) is be larger by @xmath83 . combining the above two effects",
    "would increase our estimated dynamical mass by @xmath84 .",
    "considering the large uncertainty in the virial bh masses ( a factor of 3 ) , this is unlikely to change our results .",
    "furthermore , if we were to boost the dynamical masses of the galaxies in our sample , the difference between our sample and gltekin et al.s sample would be larger .",
    "interestingly , the galaxies without extended disks show the largest offset ( red triangles in figure [ mbh ] ) .",
    "they are also the largest outliers in the faber - jackson relation in paper i. rather than scaling like pseudobulges , these galaxies scale like spheroidals in the fundamental plane .",
    "we have no complete explanation for why these galaxies are the largest outliers , but it is intriguing",
    ".    finally , we look at pseudobulges ( both active and inactive ) and use the kendall s @xmath85 rank correlation coefficient to test whether pseudobulge luminosity correlates with bh mass .",
    "the @xcite sample of pseudobulges taken alone has @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "there is no significant @xmath88  correlation among these galaxies . including our sample yields @xmath89 and @xmath90 . in this case",
    "there is marginal evidence for a very weak correlation .",

    "we investigate the @xmath2  and @xmath88  relations focused on @xmath91 .",
    "both the @xmath2  and @xmath88  relations present the same conclusion that these galaxies appear to have smaller bh masses at a given bulge mass than more massive , bulge - dominated systems . here",
    "we discuss the possible origins of this difference .",
    "it can not be easily explained by errors in the bh mass scale .",
    "we would have to boost the bh masses by @xmath67 dex , which we consider unlikely given that the sample appears to obey an @xmath6  relation @xcite .",
    "likewise , even correcting for young stellar populations in these bulges , we still find that our bhs are not consistent with the low mass extrapolation of the @xmath2relation for more massive bhs ( consistent with @xcite ) .",
    "as justified in paper i , most of our galaxies are consistent with the properties of pseudobulges ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we believe that pseudobulges are built by secular processes driven by disk instabilites .",
    "if the violent merging that builds classical bulges also establishes bh - bulge scaling relations , we would expect different ( or nonexistent ) scalings for pseudobulges .",
    "we confirm the conclusion of @xcite that there is effectively no correlation between bh mass and pseudobulge luminosity based on our much larger sample .",
    "furthermore , we extend this conclusion to bulge dynamical mass .",
    "this finding suggests that indeed , pseudobulges have quite different properties compared with classical bulges over a wide dynamic range , from @xmath9 to @xmath92 bhs .",
    "however , our sample is different from the sample of kormendy et al . in",
    "that there is no systematic offset between the kormendy et al . and the gltekin et al . sample .",
    "thus we see additional tentative evidence for larger systematic differences as a function of mass .    taking our sample alone ,",
    "the host galaxies have a wide range of bulge magnitudes over a very limited range in bh mass .",
    "in other words , the @xmath2  relation flattens out at the low - mass end .",
    "this seems to be consistent with the results from simulations of @xcite for massive bh seed models .",
    "if bh seeds can be as massive as @xmath9 , the low - mass bhs in our sample may be remnants of bh seeds that have not evolved much since they were formed .",
    "consistent with our previous claims , we suggest that secular processes are relatively inefficient at feeding central bhs .",
    "thus bulges that are built secularly maintain a low bh mass independent of the growth of their surrounding bulge .",
