    "as an important concept in quantum mechanics , entanglement plays a central role in quantum information processing .",
    "it is the resource responsible for the quantum computational speed - up , quantum communication , quantum cryptography and so on .",
    "mathematically , quantum entanglement is the the most outstanding non - classical feature of compound states that can not be decomposed as statistical mixtures of product states over subsystems , and has been found to possess a very rich structure .",
    "there exist many entanglement measures , defined under various motivations and each characterizing some of its features .",
    "the properties and relations of these entanglement measures are very much desirable for our understanding of entanglement . despite considerable achievements ,",
    "a lot of issues still remain unclear , even in the bipartite case  @xcite .    among all the existing entanglement measures ,",
    "squashed entanglement  @xcite is a particularly interesting one , with many desirable properties . in analogy to the classical intrinsic information  @xcite , squashed entanglement of a bipartite quantum state @xmath0",
    "is defined as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the quantum conditional mutual information of @xmath3 , @xmath4 with the von neumann entropy @xmath5 .",
    "squashed entanglement satisfies most of the properties that are desired or useful for an entanglement measure .",
    "for example , it is monotone under locc operations , convex and asymptotically continuous as a function of quantum states , monogamous among one party and other parties , additive on tensor products and superadditive in general  @xcite .",
    "moreover , squashed entanglement admits an operational interpretation : it is the minimum rate of qubits transmission at which a quantum state can be redistributed among two parties when arbitrary ( quantum ) side information is permitted  @xcite .",
    "quantum relative entropy , given by @xmath6 measures the distinguishability of two states @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the context of asymmetric hypothesis testing  @xcite . yet it has found important applications in other aspects of quantum information theory : the relative entropy of entanglement  @xcite is another entanglement measure that is of fundamental importance . for composite system @xmath9 ,",
    "let @xmath10 be the set of all separable states , i.e. , the states of the form @xmath11 .",
    "relative entropy of entanglement , @xmath12 quantifies the amount of entanglement of a state @xmath0 , by its relative entropy `` distance '' to the nearest separable state . since relative entropy of entanglement",
    "is strictly subadditive  @xcite , it is more meaningful in many circumstances to use its regularization , @xmath13 brando and plenio have provided operational interpretations to @xmath14 : it quantifies the optimal rate of transformation between a quantum state and maximally entangled states under non - entangling operations  @xcite , and it is also the best error exponent in quantum hypothesis testing where one of the hypothesis is many copies of the state and the other one is the set of separable states  @xcite .    for each positive operator - valued measurement ( povm )",

    "without loss of generality , we assume that the one - way classical communication in @xmath20 is always from @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",
    "we see from the definition that squashed entanglement is always non - negative , due to the strong subadditivity of von neumann entropy , which states that the quantum conditional mutual information can not be negative  @xcite . however , until very recently proven in  @xcite , the faithfulness of squashed entanglement , meaning that a bipartite quantum state has non - vanishing squashed entanglement if and only if it is entangled , had been a long - standing open question .",
    "note that the infimum in the definition of eq .",

    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : main results ] we state our main results .",
    "then , after considering quantum hypothesis testing under one - way locc measurements and obtaining a key technical lemma in section  [ sec : hypo ] , we prove these results in sections  [ sec : proof - of - monogamy - newbound ] , [ sec : proof - asycontinuity ] and [ sec : mes - pure - states ] , respectively . in section  [ sec : comparison ] , we deal with the comparisons and separations between entanglement measures and end the paper with a few open questions .",
    "before presenting the results , we introduce the variants of relative entropy of entanglement , which will be involved intensively later .",
    "piani defined the relative entropy of entanglement with respect to the set of states @xmath29 and the restricted class of measurements @xmath30  @xcite , as @xmath31 using this entanglement measure , he proved that @xmath32 is faithful , i.e. , @xmath33 if and only if @xmath0 is entangled ( same result was derived in  @xcite independently ) .    in this paper , @xmath29 is usually the set of separable states @xmath34 .",

    "* monogamy relation for relative entropy of entanglement . * one of the most fundamental properties of entanglement is monogamy : the more a quantum system is entangled with another , then the less it is entangled with the others . for any entanglement measure @xmath37 , one would expect a quantitative characterization of monogamy of the form @xmath38 although this is really the case for squashed entanglement  @xcite , relative entropy of entanglement  along with many other entanglement measures  does not satisfy such a strong relation , with the antisymmetric state being a counterexample  @xcite .    here ,",
    "we propose and prove a properly weakened monogamy inequality for relative entropy of entanglement , by invoking its one - way locc variant .",

    "in quantum hypothesis testing , we are given many copies of an information source , which is statistically described by state @xmath7 ( the null hypothesis ) or @xmath8 ( the alternative hypothesis ) .",
    "the task is to decide which state the source is really in .",
