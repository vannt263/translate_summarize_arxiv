    "it is generally accepted that the final stage of terrestrial planet formation is the giant impact stage where protoplanets or planetary embryos formed by oligarchic growth collide with one another to form planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this stage has been mainly studied by @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "so far all @xmath0-body simulations have assumed perfect accretion in which all collisions lead to accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , this assumption would be inappropriate for grazing impacts that may result in escape of an impactor or hit - and - run . by performing smoothed - particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) collision simulations",
    ", @xcite estimated that more than half of all collisions between like - sized protoplanets do not simply result in accumulation of a larger protoplanet , and this inefficiency lengthens the timescale of planet formation by a factor of 2 or more , relative to the perfect accretion case .",
    "the accretion inefficiency can also change planetary spin .",
    "@xcite found that under the assumption of perfect accretion , the typical spin angular velocity of planets is as large as the critical spin angular velocity for rotational instability .",
    "however , in reality , the grazing collisions that have high angular momentum are likely to result in a hit - and - run , while nearly head - on collisions that have small angular momentum lead to accretion . in other words ,",
    "small angular momentum collisions are selective in accretion .",
    "thus , the accretion inefficiency may lead to slower planetary spin , compared with the perfect accretion case .",
    "the goal of this paper is to clarify the statistical properties of terrestrial planets formed by giant impacts among protoplanets under a realistic accretion condition .",
    "we derive an accretion condition for protoplanet collisions in terms of collision parameters , masses of colliding protoplanets and impact velocity and angle , by performing collision experiments with an sph method .",
    "we implement the realistic accretion condition in @xmath0-body simulations and probe its effect to further generalize the model of terrestrial planet formation .",
    "we derive the statistical dynamical properties of terrestrial planets from results of a number of @xmath0-body simulations and compare the results with those in @xcite and @xcite where perfect accretion is adopted .",
    "in section 2 , we outline the initial conditions of protoplanets and the realistic accretion condition .",
    "section 3 presents our results , where we show the statistics of collision parameters and basic dynamical properties of planets .",
    "section 4 is devoted to a summary and discussions .",
    "we perform @xmath0-body simulations of terrestrial planet formation starting from protoplanets .",
    "we consider gas - free cases without giant planets residing outside the terrestrial planet region to clarify the basic dynamics . to compare with the results with perfect accretion",
    ", we adopt the same protoplanet system as those in @xcite and @xcite , which is formed by oligarchic growth from a planetesimal disk whose surface density distribution is given by @xmath2 with inner and outer edges , @xmath3au and @xmath4au , where @xmath5 is the radial distance from the central star .",
    "this disk model is the standard disk model for solar system formation and 50% more massive than the minimum - mass disk @xcite . in the oligarchic growth model ,",
    "the mass of a protoplanet @xmath6 is given by the isolation mass @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the semimajor axis , @xmath9 is the orbital separation between adjacent protoplanets , @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the hill radius @xmath12 of the protoplanet , @xmath13 is the mass of the central star , and @xmath14 is earth mass @xcite .",
    "we set the orbital separation of protoplanets as @xmath15 that is the typical value in @xmath0-body simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we set the bulk density of protoplanets as @xmath19 g@xmath20 .",
    "the initial protoplanet system has the number of protoplanets @xmath21 in @xmath22 , total mass @xmath23 , specific angular momentum @xmath24 , and mean semimajor axis @xmath25au , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the semimajor axis of earth . for each accretion model ,",
    "we perform 50 runs with different initial angular distributions of protoplanets .",
    "the orbits of protoplanets are calculated by numerically integrating the equations of motion of protoplanets .",
    "we set the mass of the central star equal to solar mass . for numerical integration",
    ", we use the modified hermite scheme for planetary @xmath0-body simulation @xcite with the hierarchical timestep @xcite . for the calculation of mutual gravity among protoplanets",
    ", we use the phantom grape scheme @xcite .",
    "the simulations follow the evolution of protoplanet systems for @xmath28 years until only a few planets remain .      during orbital integration ,",
    "when two protoplanets contact , a collision occurs .",
    "we define an impactor / target as a smaller / larger one of two colliding bodies .",
    "we obtained a realistic accretion condition of protoplanets by performing sph collision simulations .",
    "the standard sph method @xcite was used with the tillotson equation of state @xcite .",

    "protoplanets were represented by 20,000 particles in most runs and 60,000 particles in high - resolution runs .",
    "we systematically varied the mass ratio of the impactor and target as @xmath29 , 2/3 , 1/2 , 1/3 , 1/4 , 1/6 , and 1/9 , their total mass as @xmath30-@xmath31 , and the impact velocity and angle as @xmath32-@xmath33 at 0.02 or @xmath34 intervals and @xmath35-@xmath36 at @xmath37 intervals , where @xmath38 is the mutual surface escape velocity @xmath39^{1/2}$ ] , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the radii of the impactor and target , and @xmath42 is the angle between the surface normal and the impact trajectory ( @xmath35 for a head - on collision and @xmath43 for a grazing encounter ) . based on the results of sph collision simulations , we derived an empirical formula for the critical impact velocity , below which a collision leads to accretion , in terms of the masses of the impactor and target and the impact angle as @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are numerical constants . the critical impact velocity is a decrease function of @xmath49 as seen in figure  [ fig : sintheta - nu ] . for collisions of equal - mass protoplanets , this condition agrees well with the results of sph collision simulations by @xcite .",
    "the reason for this agreement is that we performed almost the same collision simulations by essentially the same method , which confirms the robustness of the results .",
    "the details of the collision simulations and the accretion condition will be presented in a separate paper . in the realistic accretion model",
    "we use this accretion condition . in accretion ,",
    "the position and velocity of the center of mass and the angular momentum are conserved .",
    "if the impact velocity @xmath50 is higher than @xmath51 , two colliding bodies are bounced with the rebound velocity @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where subscripts n and t mean normal and tangential components of the velocity , respectively . the change in spin angular momentum brought about by hit - and - run collisions is not taken into account since it is usually much smaller than that caused by accretionary collisions .",
    "these prescriptions follow the results of the collision experiments .",
    "we assume that , initially , protoplanets have no spin angular momenta .",
    "we track the spin angular momentum of planets resulting from accretion .",
    "when accretion occurs , the orbital angular momenta of two colliding bodies about their center of mass and their spin angular momenta are added to the spin angular momentum of a merged body .",
    "the spin angular velocity of planets is computed by assuming a sphere of uniform density , in other words , the moment of inertia @xmath55 , where @xmath6 and @xmath56 are the planetary mass and radius , respectively .",
    "we compare the results of the realistic accretion model to those of the perfect accretion model @xcite .",
    "the statistics of collision parameters and basic dynamical properties of planets derived from 50 runs for each accretion model are summarized in tables  [ tab : number ] and [ tab : spin ] .",
    "we record the collision parameters in all runs .",
    "the numbers of hit - and - run @xmath57 and accretionary @xmath58 collisions are summarized in table  [ tab : number ] . in the realistic accretion model ,",
    "the total number of collisions in 50 runs is 1211 . in a run , the average numbers of hit - and - run and accretionary collisions are @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively , which means on average 49% of collisions results in hit - and - run .",
    "note that the average number of accretionary collisions for the realistic accretion model is almost the same as that for the perfect accretion model .",
    "this suggests that the growth timescale of planets is independent of the accretion model .",
    "we will discuss this later .    on the giant impact stage , the last one or a few large collisions determine the final spin angular momentum of planets @xcite .",
    "in this case , the spin angular velocity is estimated as @xmath61 where @xmath62 , @xmath63^{1/2}$ ] , and @xmath64 .",
    "the critical spin angular velocity for rotational instability @xmath65 is given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the material density .",
    "in figure  [ fig : sintheta - nu ] , we plot the scaled impact velocity @xmath68 against @xmath49 for all collisions in all runs for the realistic accretion model .",
    "we show that only collisions with small @xmath68 and/or @xmath49 can lead to accretion due to the realistic accretion condition . for collisions forming earth - sized planets ( @xmath69 ) ,",
    "the rms values of the collision parameters are @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 for the realistic accretion model , and @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 for the perfect accretion model .",
    "the rms impact parameter @xmath76 for the realistic accretion model is smaller than that for the perfect accretion model since small impact parameters are selective in the realistic accretion model . also , for the same reason",
    ", the rms impact velocity @xmath68 for the realistic accretion model is slightly smaller than that for the perfect accretion model . using these rms values",
    ", we obtain the typical spin angular velocity resulting from an accretionary collision as 2.0 hr@xmath77 and 2.8 hr@xmath77 for the realistic and perfect accretion models , respectively .      the average values with standard deviations for basic dynamical properties of planets : the number of planets , @xmath78 , the number of earth - sized planets with @xmath79 , @xmath80 , the number of planets in @xmath22 , @xmath81 , the in - situ accretion efficiency @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the total mass of planets in @xmath22 , and the growth timescale @xmath84 defined as duration of accretion for each planet that undergoes at least two accretionary collisions are summarized in table  [ tab : number ] . the mass and orbital elements ( semimajor axis @xmath8 , eccentricity @xmath16 , and inclination @xmath17 ) of the largest and second - largest planets are summarized in table  [ tab : number ] .",
    "first , we find no substantial differences between the results of the two accretion models . in both models ,",
    "a typical resultant system consists of two earth - sized planets and one or two smaller planets that are as large as the initial protoplanets @xcite .",
    "the two earth - sized planets tend to form inside the initial distribution of protoplanets . the resultant system for the realistic accretion model tends to be slightly wider than that for the perfect accretion model , which can be seen as having slightly larger @xmath85 and smaller @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "this is because the realistic accretion model experiences more close encounters between protoplanets that diffuse the system .",
    "it should be noted that though about half of collisions do not lead to accretion , this accretion inefficiency does not lengthen the growth timescale by a factor of two or more , relative to the perfect accretion model as expected by @xcite .",
    "the growth timescale for the realistic accretion model is only slightly longer than that for the perfect accretion model .",
    "this is because even though collisions do not lead to accretion , the colliding bodies stay on the colliding orbits after the collision and thus the system is unstable and the next collision takes place shortly .",
    "in fact , the mean accretionary collision time for the realistic accretion model is @xmath88 years , which is as long as the mean collision time for the perfect accretion model @xmath89 years .",
    "on the other hand , in the realistic accretion model , the mean collision time after a hit - and - run collision is short as @xmath90 years , where 38% of collisions is for the same pair and its mean collision time is even shorter as @xmath91 years .",
    "figure  [ fig : a - m ] shows the average masses of the largest and second - largest planets against their average semimajor axes .",
    "we find that there are no differences in either mass or semimajor axis of the planets for the realistic and perfect accretion models .",
    "the largest planets with @xmath92 tend to form around @xmath93 au , while the second - largest planets with @xmath94 is widely scattered in the initial protoplanet region .",
    "we also find no difference in their eccentricities and inclinations , and those are @xmath95 .",
    "these eccentricities and inclinations are an order of magnitude larger than the proper eccentricities and inclinations of the present terrestrial planets .",
    "some damping mechanism such as gravitational drag ( dynamical friction ) from a dissipating gas disk @xcite or a residual planetesimal disk @xcite is necessary after the giant impact stage .      in 50 runs of the realistic and perfect accretion models , we have 128 and 124 planets that experience at least one accretionary collision , respectively .",
    "the average values of each component of the spin angular velocity @xmath96 of the planets and its dispersion @xmath97 are summarized in table  [ tab : spin ] together with the root - mean - square ( rms ) spin angular velocity @xmath98 and the spin anisotropy parameter @xmath99 .",
    "the spin angular velocity averaged in mass bins against mass is shown in figure  [ fig : m - w_ave_cmp]a .",
    "we show clearly that the average angular velocity is almost independent of mass for both accretion models . for the perfect accretion model , the average values are as high as the critical angular velocity @xmath65 .",
    "these are natural outcomes for the giant impact stage under the assumption of perfect accretion @xcite .",
    "the rms spin angular velocity for the realistic accretion model is about 30% smaller than that for the perfect accretion model .",
    "this is because in the realistic accretion model , grazing and high - velocity collisions that have high angular momentum result in a hit - and - run , while nearly head - on or low - velocity collisions that have small angular momentum lead to accretion . in other words , small angular momentum collisions are selective in accretion .",
    "thus , the accretion inefficiency leads to slower planetary spin , compared with the perfect accretion model .",
    "indeed , the rms spin angular velocity is almost consistent with the estimation by equation  ( [ eq : w ] ) in section  [ sec : collision_parameter ] .",
    "the rms spin angular velocity slightly larger than the estimation based on a single dominant accretionary collision is due to the contribution of other non - dominant accretionary collisions .",
    "we confirm that each component of @xmath100 follows a gaussian distribution .",
    "we perform a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test to confirm the agreement with a gaussian distribution . for the distribution of each component",
    ", we obtain sufficiently high values of the k - s probability @xmath101 in both accretion models .    in figure  [",
    "fig : m - w_ave_cmp]b , we show the obliquity distribution with an isotropic distribution , @xmath102 .",
    "we find that the obliquity ranges from 0@xmath103 to 180@xmath103 and follows an isotropic distribution @xmath102 , which is consistent with @xcite and @xcite . by a k - s test",
    ", we obtain high k - s probabilities of 0.3 and 0.9 for the realistic and perfect accretion models , respectively .",
    "this is also confirmed by the spin anisotropy parameter @xmath104 in table  [ tab : spin ] .",
    "the isotropic distribution of @xmath105 is a natural outcome of giant impacts since the impacts are three - dimensional and add equally random contributions to each component of the spin angular momentum @xcite .    for an earth mass planet , the rms spin angular velocity 2.35 hr@xmath77 of the realistic accretion model corresponds to the spin angular momentum of @xmath106 g @xmath107 s@xmath77 , which is 2.7 times larger than the angular momentum of the earth - moon system .",
    "so the angular momentum of the earth - moon system is not a typical value of the realistic accretion model but it is reasonably within the distribution of @xmath96 .",
    "we have investigated the basic dynamical properties of the terrestrial planets assembled by giant impacts of protoplanets by using @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "for the first time , we adopted the realistic accretion condition of protoplanets obtained by the sph collision experiments .",
    "the basic dynamical properties have been studied statistically with numbers of @xmath0-body simulations . for the standard protoplanet system ,",
    "the statistical properties of the planets obtained are the following :    * about half of collisions in the realistic accretion model do not lead to accretion .",
    "however , this accretion inefficiency barely lengthens the growth timescale of planets . *",
    "the numbers of planets are @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the growth timescale is about @xmath110 years .",
    "the masses of the largest and second - largest planets are @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the largest planets tend to form around @xmath93au , while @xmath113 is widely scattered in the initial protoplanet region .",
    "their eccentricities and inclinations are @xmath95 .",
    "these results are independent of the accretion model . *",
    "the rms spin angular velocity for the realistic accretion model is about 30% smaller than that for the perfect accretion model that is as large as the critical spin angular velocity for rotational instability .",
    "the spin angular velocity and obliquity of planets obey gaussian and isotropic distributions , respectively , independently of the accretion model .",
    "we confirm that except for the magnitude of the spin angular velocity , the realistic accretion model gives the same results as the perfect accretion model .",
    "this agreement justifies the use of the perfect accretion model to investigate the basic dynamical properties of planets except for the magnitude of the spin angular velocity .    in the present realistic accretion condition",
    ", we do not consider the effect of the spin on the accretion condition that would potentially change collisional dynamics .",
    "it is difficult to derive an accretion condition in terms of spin parameters by sph collision simulations since the collision parameter space becomes huge and it is almost impossible to cover all parameter space .",
    "the fragmentation of planets is not taken into account , either . including the fragmentation may be able to further reduce the spin angular velocity of planets by producing unbound collisional fragments with high angular momentum .",
    "furthermore , the collisional fragments can potentially alter orbital dynamics of planets through dynamical friction if their mass is large enough .",
    "the high eccentricities and inclinations of planets may be damped by dynamical friction from the collisional fragments . in order to take into account these effects and make the model of terrestrial planet formation more realistic",
    ", we plan to perform @xmath0-body simulations for orbital dynamics and sph simulations for collisional dynamics simultaneously in a consistent way in future work .",
