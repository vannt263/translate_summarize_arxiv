    "the unwanted spontaneous emission often sets the ultimate limit of precise quantum measurement and many proposals have been made to suppress it  @xcite .",
    "one way widely applied to control the spontaneous emission of a small quantum system , such as a neutral atom , is to place it either into or nearby a microcavity such that only a single mode or several modes of the cavity are resonant to the eigenfrequency of the quantum system  @xcite . in this way",
    "the structure of the vacuum is modified and the spontaneous emission could be controlled by the properties of the cavity . another way to control",
    "the spontaneous emission is dynamical control of the quantum system such that the coupling between the quantum system and the vacuum is effectively modified .",
    "for example , dynamical decoupling of the quantum system from the vacuum via either phase modulation or amplitude modulation could in principle extend the coherent time of the system  @xcite .",
    "analogous to the quantum zeno effect ( ze ) which says frequent measurements of a quantum system would prevent the decay of an unstable quantum system  @xcite , the extension of the coherent time through coherent modulations of the quantum system are often called ze as well . under some unfavorable conditions ,",
    "it is also possible that frequent modulations lead to acceleration of the spontaneous emission , the so - called quantum anti - zeno effect ( aze )  @xcite .    in practice people",
    "employ both ways separately or combination of them to realize the optimal control of a quantum system .",
    "g. s. agarwal _ et al .",
    "_ s work  @xcite is among many of such works . in their paper , a two - level model system with both structured vacuum and free space vacuum are investigated .",
    "they found significant suppression of spontaneous emission rate for structured vacua but either suppression or acceleration may appear in a free space vacuum , depending on the frequency of the control pulses which is @xmath0 phase modulation pulses .",
    "they demonstrated for a free space vacuum that ze shows up for @xmath1 while aze appears for @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the eigenfrequency of the two - level system and @xmath4 is the delay time between control pulses . at the end",
    "they argued that aze is possible for @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "a puzzle arises if one accepts the aze condition because neither ze or aze appear if one leaves the quantum system alone in which case obviously @xmath6 . in this paper",
    "we revisit this problem by adopting the exact solution of a two - level quantum system which does not require the weak coupling and short time approximations compared to ref .",
    "@xcite . by investigating several typical structured vacuum",
    ", we show the conditions for quantum ze and aze and the boundary between them .",
    "another puzzle is the ze effect of a large number of pulses . according to the ze , at a fixed evolution time @xmath7 , the survival probability of the initially excited state approaches 1 with infinite number of pulses @xmath8 ( the pulse delay @xmath9 approaches 0 ) .",
    "it is unclear what the road map looks like as @xmath10 increases .",

    "one way is that the rate of decay depends solely on the pulse delay @xmath4 ( independent on @xmath10 ) and approaches zero if @xmath11  @xcite .",
