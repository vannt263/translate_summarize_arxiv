    "observational studies of exoplanet systems present a unique opportunity to probe the mechanisms behind planet formation . over the past decade",
    ", surveys using a variety of techniques ( radial velocity , transit , microlensing , direct imaging ) have revealed a multitude of new systems with astoundingly diverse properties .",
    "many of these systems are difficult to explain within the framework of standard planet formation theories ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and have forced theorists and observers alike to re - evaluate their narratives for planet formation and migration .",
    "perhaps one of the biggest challenges for planet formation models comes from direct imaging surveys , which have uncovered of a new population of young planetary - mass companions ( pmcs ) ( @xmath6 15 m@xmath4 ) located beyond 50 au .    in 2004",
    "chauvin et al . discovered a 5 m@xmath4 companion 2m1207 b orbiting 55 au away from a 25 m@xmath4 brown dwarf .",
    "shortly afterwards , additional discoveries of other wide - separation pmcs such as ab pic b @xcite , dh tau b @xcite , and chxr 73 b @xcite drove observers and theorists to question how this growing population of objects formed @xcite . to date , fifteen pmcs at large orbital distances have been confirmed , most of which are extremely young , @xmath610 myr old @xcite .",
    "three possible formation routes have been proposed for these wide - separation planets , including direct collapse from molecular cloud fragmentation , disk instability , and core accretion plus gas capture , but all three have significant problems explaining this population of pmcs .    in the process of turbulent fragmentation",
    ", all stellar and substellar objects begin as opacity - limited fragments with masses of a few jupiter masses and subsequently begin to accrete gas from the molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamical star formation simulations have shown that in order to stop accretion at brown dwarf or planetary masses , pmcs must either form at nearly the same time that the circumstellar envelope is exhausted , or else they must be dynamically ejected from the densest regions of gas before they are able to accrete much additional mass @xcite .",
    "this mechanism has a very difficult time producing binaries with the high mass ratios needed to match the observed wide - separation planetary systems .    in models of disk instability ,",
    "gas giant planets form rapidly via fragmentation of a gravitationally unstable disk . for this model to work",
    ", the disk needs to be massive enough and cold enough to gravitationally collapse . in the majority of scenarios ,",
    "the disk surface densities beyond 100 au are too low for gravitational instability to operate .",
    "while some models show that disk fragmentation can occur outside 100 au @xcite , the fragments rarely survive to become full - fledged planetary embryos .",
    "this low survival probability is due to processes such as inward migration and accretion onto the host star , or ejection from the system due to dynamical interactions .",
    "while it has been suggested that disk instability could be effective for exceptionally massive disks , this is an extremely limited region of disk parameter space @xcite .    finally ,",
    "in the core accretion model , cores grow via successions of two - body collisions between solids until they are massive enough to start runaway gas accretion @xcite . in situ",
    "formation of massive wide - separation planets through core accretion is unlikely since the timescale to grow massive cores at these separations is longer than the observed lifetimes of protoplanetary disks .",
    "however , recent simulations of core formation via pebble accretion have shown that gas giant cores can form at separations out to 50 au comfortably before the gas in the disk dissipates @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it might be possible for these giant planets to form closer to the star and be subsequently scattered out beyond 100 au by another planet in the system .",
    "one potential scenario is that if multiple planet - planet scatterings occur , these giant planets could permanently end up in stable , wide - separation orbits @xcite .",
    "simulations have shown that in this case , these wide - separation planets have high eccentricities of @xmath00.5 @xcite .",
    "while planet - planet scattering seems to be a potential solution , it requires another body in the system at least as massive as the wide separation planets .    thus far , despite hundreds of hours of ao imaging , only one multi - planet system has been confirmed with this technique , hr 8799 @xcite .",
    "recently , two surveys have found evidence of additional planets in two more systems : lkca 15 and hd 100546 @xcite .",
    "searching for additional planets in these directly imaged systems is critical to understanding the formation and orbital evolution of planets at wide separations , a parameter space currently explored solely by the direct imaging technique .    in this study , we explore the possibility that the observed wide - separation pmcs formed closer in to their host stars , and were scattered out to their present day locations by another massive companion within the system .",
    "we conducted an angular differential imaging ( adi ) survey with nirc2 at keck in search of close - in substellar companions to a sample of seven systems with confirmed pmcs on extremely wide orbits .",
    "our observations are sensitive to companions at significantly lower masses and smaller separations than previous studies of these systems , and allow us to place much stronger constraints on the presence of inner companions .",
    "we also use these same systems to calculate the first estimate of the multiplicity of directly imaged planetary systems .",
    "this paper is structured in the following manner . in section 2",
    "we describe the selected sample of systems and the methods for obtaining the adi imaging data . in section 3",
    "we describe the pca reduction of the images as well as a new method to simultaneously calculate astrometry and relative photometry of candidate companions .",
    "finally , in section 4 we discuss our results and their implications for the formation mechanisms of this population of wide - separation pmcs .",
    "we selected our targets from the sample of 15 systems with confirmed companions beyond 50 au with mass ranges that are either below or straddle the deuterium burning limit ( @xmath6 15 m@xmath4 ) .",
    "these systems are as a whole extremely young , which translates into higher sensitivity to lower mass planets at smaller separations . from this larger sample",
    ", we selected targets that were observable from keck and that had previously been imaged only with short integrations .",
    "this would allow our deeper follow - up imaging to achieve unprecedented levels of sensitivity in these systems .",
    "altogether , we targeted seven systems : roxs  42b , roxs  12 , hn  peg , hd  203030 , dh  tau , lp  26175 , and 2mass  j012250243950 .",
    "table 1 summarizes the properties of this sample .",
    "in addition , we targeted 2mass  j1626277442527247 , which does not have a previously confirmed wide - separation pmc .",
    "this star is a wide separation stellar companion to roxs 12 , located @xmath240 \" away . not only",
    "do the two stars show identical proper motion , but 2m16262527 and roxs 12 also exhibit wise excesses , indicating that these objects form a wide binary , are disk - bearing , and are young .",

    "we then used principle component analysis ( pca ) to further reduce these images .",
    "pca is an algorithm that has recently been applied to high contrast imaging for increasing the contrast achievable next to a bright star . in short",
    ", pca is a mathematical technique that relies on the assumption that every image in a stack can be represented as a linear combination of its principle orthogonal components , selecting structures that are present in most of the images .",
    "the stellar psf , composed of a sum or orthogonal components , is subtracted from each image , thereby providing access to faint companions at contrasts below the speckle noise .",
    "we used a pca routine following the method presented in @xcite which uses the klip algorithm .",
    "the optimal number of principle components to use in a reduction is set by the trade - off between speckle noise and self - attenuation of the signal of interest .",
    "too few components might not subtract enough speckle noise near the star , and too many may lead to self - subtraction of the planetary signal , reducing the achievable contrasts . in our analysis , we optimized the number of components used for each individual system empirically .",

    "* ) . to avoid this",
    ", we developed an mcmc algorithm that simultaneously calculates the astrometry and relative photometry of these candidate companions .",
    "for each iteration in the mcmc process , we injected a negative psf into each individual science image in the vicinity of the companion of interest prior to de - rotation , where we modeled these negative psfs as moffat distributions .",
    "there were three parameters that we varied with each step during the mcmc routine , namely the negative psf amplitude , separation , and position angle .",
    "we fixed all other free parameters to the values determined from fitting the moffat distribution to the stellar psf .",
    "the science images with injected negative psfs were then run through the pca reduction routine . the smaller the rms noise at the location of the candidate companion , the better the fit of the negative psf .",
    "the result of this mcmc analysis is a posterior distribution for the amplitude , separation , and position angle of the candidate companions , an example of which is shown in figure 3 .",
    "figure 4 compares a reduced image with and without the best - fit negative psf injected at the best fit separation and position angle of the candidate companion .",
    "in addition to the errors from the candidate companion pdfs for the separation and position angle , after the mcmc program is finished we also account for uncertainties from the registration of the stellar position in each science image , uncertainties from the distortion correction , and uncertainties associated with the plate scale .",
    "we also include the @xmath93 degree correction for north alignment to the nirc2 header position angles @xcite for epochs taken before april 2015 , and for subsequent epochs include the @xmath94 degree correction for north alignment @xcite .",
    "this mcmc technique calculates robust uncertainties from the posterior distributions , without the systematic uncertainties that occur when the reduced loci or pca images are used .",
    "the best - fit separations and position angles for each candidate companion , as well as confirmed companions in these systems , are presented in table 4 .    while the separation , position angle , and amplitude are the three parameters that were actively varied with each step in the mcmc program , we also track the total flux of the candidate companion . for each link in the chain , we place an aperture at the separation and position angle of that step and sum the number of counts in the aperture . while the size of the aperture for a given companion remains fixed , the aperture size ranged from 4  6 pixels depending on the candidate companion fwhm",
    ". the aperture moves with the changes in position angle and separation as the mcmc program progresses , producing a posterior distribution of counts for the candidate companion .",
    "we note that since we calculate the astrometry and relative photometry simultaneously using this mcmc program , we use the same aperture sizes for both of these steps for a given candidate companion .",
    "we next calculate the contrast relative to the host star , @xmath95 , for each candidate companion . to determine the flux from the star , the throughput of the occulting spot ( @xmath96 , bowler et al 2015 ) , and the sky noise need to be accounted for .",
    "the measured counts are a combination of the flux from the star plus the flux from the sky , both attenuated by the throughput of the mask .",
    "we denote this combined and attenuated star plus sky flux as @xmath97 .",
    "the corrected flux for the star is shown in equation 1 .",
    "@xmath98 is the throughput ( 0.0022 ) of the mask in @xmath38 , @xmath99 is the sky flux , and @xmath100 is the flux from the star corrected for both throughput losses and sky noise .",

    "instead , we used centroiding on the final image to obtain the separation and position angle of the candidate companion , and adopted the robust errors calculated for the faint hd 203030 cc1 .",

    "( 2015 ) , based on the method of ghez et al .",
    "this technique generates an initial orbit with semi - major axis ( @xmath218 ) of unity and position angle of nodes ( @xmath219 ) of 0 , with eccentricity ( @xmath220 ) , inclination angle ( @xmath182 ) , argument of periastron ( @xmath221 ) , and epoch of periastron passage ( @xmath222 ) drawn from the appropriate probability distribution : uniform for @xmath220 , @xmath221 , t@xmath223 , and uniform in cos(@xmath182 ) , and we use kepler s third law to generate the period from a fixed system mass .",
    "we then scale @xmath218 and rotate @xmath219 to fit a single observational epoch , with observational errors included by adding gaussian random noise to the observed separation and position angle for that epoch with @xmath47 equal to the observational errors .",
    "stellar mass and distance for each trial are both drawn from gaussian distributions with medians at the measurements and standard deviations of the measurement uncertainties . unlike de rosa et al .",
    "( 2015 ) where all potential orbits where shifted and scaled to the earliest epoch , here we randomly select an epoch for each orbit , which avoids the fit being biased toward the first epoch .",
    "the algorithm has also been modified at the rejection sampling step : previously we proceeded one epoch at a time , rejecting ill - fitting orbits at each epoch . in this version",
    "the chi - square for the newly - scaled orbit is calculated for all the remaining epochs , and then the orbit is accepted if a uniform random variable is less than @xmath224 and rejected otherwise .",
    "mathematically this is the same operation as we used previously , but it allows for higher computational efficiency in the face of outliers , since the rejection test can be scaled to the minimum value of @xmath225 reached for the given astrometry , with orbits now accepted if the random variable is less than @xmath224 / @xmath226 .",
    "this method will be described in more detail in blunt et al .",
    "( 2016 , in prep ) .",
    "this rejection sampling technique produces identical posterior probability distributions to those generated by mcmc , but requires much less computational time for astrometry covering short arcs of an orbit , as demonstrated in de rosa et al .",
    "( 2015 ) for the exoplanet 51 eri b. in the very long - period orbits presented here we find that even after @xmath227 steps of metropolis hastings mcmc the chains have not converged , though the posteriors are broadly similar to those generated by the rejection sampling method .    figures 8 and 9 show the range of keplerian orbits consistent with the available astrometry for roxs 12 b and roxs 42b b respectively , while figures 10 and 11 show the posterior distributions for the orbital parameters that were fit for roxs 12 b and roxs 42b b , respectively .",
    "we note that even with a small fraction of orbital coverage , fitting orbits and obtaining marginal constraints on the corresponding parameters is useful .",
    "for example , several recent studies have fit the small orbital coverage observed for fomalhaut b , and find that they can constrain the eccentricity of this object to high values @xcite . furthermore , detected orbital motion of the low mass brown dwarfs pz tel b and gq lup b appears to constrain their eccentricities to high values @xcite .",
    "while the eccentricities of these pmcs are poorly constrained , we do find that low to moderate eccentricities are favored .",
    "the 95@xmath5 upper limits on the eccentricities of roxs 42b b and roxs 12 b are 0.58 and 0.83 respectively .",
    "previous studies have run scattering simulations to test if these wide - separation ( @xmath0 100 au ) pmcs can form via planet - planet scattering .",
    "these simulations showed that for giant planets that end up outside of 100 au , their eccentricities are significantly pumped up to @xmath0 0.5 @xcite .",
    "the fact that the eccentricity distributions for roxs 42b b and roxs 12 b favor moderate to low eccentricities argues against the scattering hypothesis for these companions .",
    "note that while a uniform prior on the eccentricity is used in these fits , the eccentricity posterior is significantly different .",
    "we can conclude that the eccentricity posterior is a reflection of the underlying companion eccentricity and not of the prior chosen . to further test this , we ran these orbit fits with two additional eccentricity priors , the @xmath228 distribution @xcite and the thermal distribution @xcite .",
    "the thermal distribution of eccentricities , which is proportional to @xmath229 d@xmath220 , is the distribution that binary companions should follow if they are distributed solely as a function of energy .",
    "the eccentricity posteriors using these priors are overplotted with the eccentricity posterior found using a uniform prior in the top right plot in figures 10 and 11 .",
    "for both roxs 12 b and roxs 42b b , while the eccentricity posterior using the thermal distribution prior pushes to higher eccentricities , in general lower to moderate eccentricities are favored .",
    "we calculate the detection probability for additional companions in these eight systems over a range of masses and separations .",
    "our contrast curves can be converted into sensitivity maps in mass and semi - major axis using evolutionary models , the age and distance of the system and the uncertainties on these values , and an underlying distribution of planet eccentricities .",
    "following bowler et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , we generate a population of artificial companions on random , circular keplerian orbits with a given mass and semi - major axis .",
    "each synthetic planet is assigned an apparent magnitude using an interpolated grid of the cond hot - start evolutionary models ( baraffe et al 2003 ) , the distance and age of the host star , and the companion mass .",
    "we use the cond evolutionary models because they extend down to planetary masses , although we note that different models can vary significantly in their predictions for the same planet mass .",
    "we do not explicitly account for this model - dependent error in our final analysis .",
    "the fraction of companions falling above a contrast curve compared to those falling below it yields the fractional sensitivity at that grid point .",
    "we further take into account the fractional field of view coverage for each target , which is uniformly complete out to 4 \" for our sample and drops to zero beyond that .",
    "iterating over masses between 0.5100 m@xmath4 and semi - major axes between 11000 au yields sensitivity maps for each target , which are shown in figure 12 for this sample .",
    "depending on the distance and age of the target , our observations are generally sensitive to 110   m@xmath4 companions beyond about 30  au .",
    "except for dh tau cc1 , which remains ambiguous , none of the new candidate companions detected in our sample are bound .",
    "while we can generally rule out the existence of massive scatterers above our detection limits ( outside of 15 - 50 au for massive planets ) , we can not unambiguously rule out scattering as a formation mechanism based on our results alone , since the massive scatterers might be located closer in .",
    "however , our results combined with complementary lines of evidence suggest that formation close to the host star plus subsequent scattering is probably not the dominant formation mechanism for these wide - separation pmcs .",
    "note that in order for the scattering scenario to operate , there must be a body that is often at least as massive as these already massive pmcs closer in to the host stars @xcite .",
    "we present a comprehensive list of this evidence below .    * in this study , we do not find any potential scatterers down to @xmath2 15 - 50 au in this sample of seven systems which host wide - separation pmcs . furthermore , other studies with comparably deep imaging of wide separation pmcs also did not find any potential scatterers in hd 106906 and 1 rxs 1609 - 2105 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "efforts using non - redundant aperture masking techniques have probed higher masses ( @xmath015 m@xmath4 ) down to smaller separations ( @xmath0 @xmath230 au ) , and have likewise found a dearth of inner companions @xcite .",
    "if additional inner gas giant planets or brown dwarfs are present , they must be located within a few tens of au of their host stars . *",
    "moderate to low eccentricities are favored for roxs 12 b and roxs 42b b , which both exhibit orbital motion .",
    "this is in contrast to the predictions of scattering simulations , which show that giant planets that get scattered out to @xmath0100 au typically have high eccentricities @xmath00.5 @xcite . * from rv studies ,",
    "it is clear that high - mass planets are rare .",
    "this is evident from the significantly negative power law in mass found by @xcite for a sample of giant planets 0.3  10 m@xmath4 out to 3 au , where for a power law @xmath231 , @xmath232 . within this semi - major axis range",
    ", this power law implies that the occurrence rate of giant planets in the range 5 - 10 m@xmath4 is @xmath233 .",
    "similarly , work by bryan et al ( 2016 ) suggests that for a sample of gas giant planets outside 5 au , lower - mass planets are more frequent than higher - mass planets .",
    "this implies that planets massive enough to be potential scatterers for the wide - separation directly imaged planets in this study ( @xmath0 5 m@xmath4 ) are intrinsically rare in rv surveys .",
    "however , even if massive planets are disfavored generally , this does nt necessarily mean that there would only be one super - massive planet per system .",
    "for example , perhaps unusual disk properties are required to form a @xmath0 5 m@xmath4 planet , but once this kind of disk is formed it is easy to form multiple massive planets at a range of separations . given the low estimated occurrence rate of wide - separation pmcs ( less than a few percent ) , this might be consistent with the low occurrence rate of massive planets found in rv surveys . * dynamical interactions between planets preferentially scatter out lower - mass planets @xcite",
    ". however , lower - mass planets ( @xmath6 5 m@xmath4 ) have not been discovered at distances greater than 100 au despite the fact that many surveys were sensitive down to a few jupiter masses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this implies that the companion mass function truncates at @xmath25 m@xmath4 , inconsistent with scattering .",
    "* rough estimates of the occurrence rate of these massive ( @xmath0 5 m@xmath4 ) wide - separation pmcs yield at most a frequency of a few percent @xcite .",
    "in contrast , scattering simulations , which began with 100 systems populated with 10 planets each with masses between 0.1 - 10 m@xmath4 drawn from a uniform distribution in logm and with separations @xmath6 30 au drawn from a uniform distribution in semi - major axis , find that the occurrence rate of scattered planets from 1  10 m@xmath4 outside of 300 au is @xmath20.2@xmath5 at @xmath210 myr @xcite . furthermore , of the 0.2@xmath5 occurrence rate of all planets from 1  10 m@xmath4 that get scattered beyond 300 au , only a few percent of that population are @xmath0 4 m@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this implies that the occurrence rate of massive ( @xmath0 5 m@xmath4 ) scattered planets predicted by these simulations is of the order several hundredths of a percent , which is orders of magnitude smaller than any of the occurrence rate measurements from surveys thus far .",
    "* many of these widely - separation pmcs are actively accreting from a circumplanetary disk @xcite . however , if these objects were dynamically scattered , we might expect the circumplanetary disk to be partially or completely stripped away @xcite .",
    "this implies that many if not all of the pmcs that we find did not undergo such a violent evolution and were thus able to keep their disks .",
    "taken together , these lines of evidence indicate that the most likely origin for these wide - separation pmcs is in situ formation",
    ". evidence for in situ formation , by cloud fragmentation or disk instability , includes the fact that pmcs have been found orbiting low - mass brown dwarfs with decidedly non - planetary mass ratios , implying that the tail of the initial mass function appears to continue down to at least 5 10 m@xmath4 .",
    "in addition , @xcite found that a single power law distribution is consistent with a sample of 5  70 m@xmath4 objects from the seeds survey .",
    "given that results from many other surveys are well fit by this same power law distribution , this suggests that this population immediately below the deuterium - burning threshold are the end of a smooth mass function , sharing a common origin with more massive brown dwarfs .",
    "we now consider the multiplicity of directly imaged planetary systems .",
    "although we did not find any new companions in our sample , we can place an upper limit on the occurrence rate of inner , massive planets in systems with previously known wide - separation pmcs . since we have no detections , our occurrence rate is simply :    @xmath234    where @xmath235 is the number of planets that we missed in our survey due to incompleteness , and @xmath236 is the number of systems in our sample .    the number of planets that we missed due to survey incompleteness can be expressed as :    @xmath237 .\\ ] ]    here , @xmath238 is the probability of detecting a planet of mass @xmath239 at semi - major axis @xmath218 for system @xmath182 .",
    "we have these values for a grid of masses and semi - major axes from our detection probability calculations , described in section 3.4 and shown in figure 8 .",
    "the quantity @xmath240 is the assumed distribution in mass and semi - major axis for the population of planets whose occurrence rate we wish to calculate . in our calculation",
    "we adopt the underlying distribution in @xcite , which combines five different exoplanet surveys compiled using three different detection methods to derive a double power law distribution in mass and semi - major axis for giant planets .",
    "this power law takes the form :    @xmath241    in this equation , @xmath242 , @xmath243 , and @xmath244 .",
    "we note that this power law was derived specifically for m dwarf host stars . out of our seven systems with previously confirmed pmcs ,",
    "five of the host stars are m stars .",
    "we then create a 30@xmath4330 grid evenly spaced in logarithmic bins with masses from 1  100 m@xmath4 and semi - major axes ranging from 1  1000 au , and determine the power law distribution values at each grid point .    since we want to determine the probability of finding an inner planet given that an outer pmc has been detected , we calculated the occurrence rate of pmcs between 5  15 m@xmath4 and from 40 au to the location of each pmc .",
    "the inner limit on the separation was chosen because we are reasonably complete for massive planets beyond 40 au for most of our systems . in order to take into account the large uncertainties on the power law parameters",
    ", we calculated the occurrence rate using a monte carlo method with @xmath245 trials , each time drawing a new @xmath246 , @xmath247 , and @xmath228 value from a gaussian distribution with widths equal to the parameter uncertainties .",
    "this yielded a distribution of missed planets , which we converted to a distribution in occurrence rate .",
    "we found that the 95@xmath5 confidence upper limit on the occurrence rate of planetary companions interior to our sample of previously known wide separation pmcs is 54@xmath5 .",
    "this result assumes the companion distribution shown in equation 8 as well as hot start evolutionary models .",
    "this first estimate of the occurrence rate upper limit will be better constrained with the discovery and analysis of more pmc systems .",
    "note that covariances between parameters have not been taken into account in this method , which inflates our upper limit .",
    "we conducted a deep angular differential imaging ( adi ) survey with nirc2 at keck in search of close - in substellar companions to a sample of seven systems with confirmed pmcs on extremely wide orbits ( @xmath0100 au ) .",
    "we explored the possibility that the wide - separation pmcs formed closer in to their host stars and were subsequently scattered out to their present day locations by a more massive body in the system . in this survey we obtained deep imaging for each target , for the first time probing significantly lower masses and smaller separations in all systems .    within our sample",
    "we found eight candidate companions . using second epoch data , we measured the astrometry for each candidate and determined whether or not they were co - moving by using an mcmc technique that calculates robust uncertainties from the posterior distributions , without the systematics that occur when the reduced images are used .",
    "seven candidate companions are unequivocally background objects , while the candidate companion near dh tau remains ambiguous .",
    "although our results alone do not conclusively rule out formation closer in to the host star followed by scattering as a formation mechanism for these wide - separation pmcs , the totality of evidence suggests that scattering is not a dominant formation mechanism .",
    "instead , formation of these objects in situ appears to be more likely .",
    "if we wish to better understand how these wide separation pmcs formed , there are several possible approaches to consider .",
    "@xmath248 will allow us to carve out the immediate environment around these young stars , which has been extremely difficult with our current imaging capabilities ( due to unfavorable contrasts close to the star ) , and radial velocity capabilities ( due to high jitter values for young stars ) .",
    "furthermore , studying the composition of these pmcs by obtaining high resolution spectra might allow us to distinguish amongst formation mechanisms @xcite . while the core accretion model predicts that planets should have enhanced metallicities relative to their host stars , formation via disk instability or turbulent fragmentation should result in compositions matching those of the host star .",
