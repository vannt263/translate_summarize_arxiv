    "phase transition is one of the fundamental issues in physics .",
    "most of the successes on the topics in the field of spin glasses  @xcite have been limited to the mean - field models  @xcite .",
    "unveiling the structure of phase diagrams in finite - dimensional spin glasses remains one of the most challenging problems .",
    "in particular , although the phase transition to the spin - glass phase is a characteristic phenomenon in spin glasses , we have not had a clear understanding of its nature in finite dimensions .",
    "moreover , the determination of the order - disorder phase boundaries in spin glasses has a practical significance beyond pure physicists interest , since the boundaries in spin glasses correspond to the accuracy threshold in topological quantum error - correcting codes  @xcite .    concerning the phase diagram ,",
    "there has been a proposition based on the property of the nishimori line ( nl )  @xcite , which is a special line across the phase diagram depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] ,     ising model in two dimensions .",
    "the vertical and horizontal axes express the temperature and the concentration of ferromagnetic bonds , respectively .",
    "the symbols p , f , and sg denote the paramagnetic , ferromagnetic , and spin - glass phases , respectively .",
    "the nishimori line ( nl ) is drawn as a dashed line .",
    "the critical concentration at zero temperature is denoted by @xmath0.,width=151 ]    that the phase transition between the ferromagnetic and non - ferromagnetic phases at lower temperature than the nl is induced by a geometric nature  @xcite.the form of the entropy of frustration distribution is identical to the form of the free energy on the nl .",
    "frustration is a geometric quantity to be defined later .",
    "since phase transitions are usually signaled by singularities in the free energy , the entropy of frustration distribution also has a singularity at the transition point on the nl .",
    "this is the origin of the geometry - induced phase transition .",
    "however , this proposition is a conjecture since the singularities in the free energy and the entropy of frustration distribution do not necessarily coincide in regions other than the nl .",
    "the case of the nl , nevertheless , suggests the potential of frustration in the phase transitions in spin glasses .    in order to illustrate the concept of frustration , we consider the @xmath1 ising model on a square lattice governed by the hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 takes either @xmath4 with probability @xmath5 or @xmath6 with probability @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is an ising variable ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the summation runs over nearest neighbors .",
    "if the number of negative ( antiferromagnetic ) coupling constants is odd in a loop composed of bonds , there is no spin configuration , permitting all bonds to be in the lower - energy state ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the product of coupling constants @xmath11 over an arbitrary loop @xmath12 is called frustration  @xcite .",
    "if the frustration of a loop has a negative value , the loop is regarded as a  frustrated loop \" .",
    "motivated by the argument about the geometry - induced phase transition , we aim to detect phase transitions only with consideration of frustration in the present study .",
    "more specifically , we focus our attention on the number of frustrated plaquettes in the ising spin glass models .",
    "note that a `` plaquette '' means an elementary loop composed of bonds on the lattice , which can not be divided into any other loops .",
    "we observe the change in the average number of frustrated plaquettes as the average number of antiferromagnetic bonds is increased .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we consider the @xmath1 ising model on the two - dimensional lattices , and an interesting relationship between the average number of frustrated plaquettes and the transition point at zero temperature is found . in sect .",
    "3 the cases of the hierarchical lattices are examined .",
    "we confirm the same relationship in the model with three - body interactions in sect .",
    "the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model is investigated in sect .",
    "the final section is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "let us consider the frustration in the @xmath1 ising model [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : pmj ] ) ] on the square lattice .",
    "we investigate the frustration of plaquettes , which are squares composed of four bonds in the case of the square lattice . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sq_lattice ] ,        dashed lines express the square lattice and antiferromagnetic bonds are traversed by thick segments .",
    "a circle in a plaquette means that the plaquette is frustrated .",
    "the figure shows that ends of a segment identify frustrated plaquettes .",
    "consider a loop on the lattice and a segment @xmath13 .",
    "we represent the number of intersections of the loop and the segment as @xmath14 and the number of ends of the segment inside the loop as @xmath15 .",
    "if one of the ends lies inside the loop and the other end lies outside , the segment has to cross the loop an odd number of times , that is , @xmath14 is an odd number .",
    "in contrast , if both the ends lie on the same side of the loop , @xmath14 is an even number .",
    "the relation @xmath16 is satisfied as a result . since",
    "similar equations are derived for any segment , we have @xmath17 where the summation runs over segments on the lattice .",
    "the left - hand side of this equation is the product @xmath18 , where @xmath12 denotes the loop .",
    "thus , we extract only the parity of the number of circles inside the loop from the product .",
    "when the loop contains an even number of circles , the product misses them , but no spin configuration realizes the lower - energy state in all couplings .",
    "hence , it is appropriate to consider elementary loops , namely plaquettes , to investigate the frustration in the system .",
    "we calculate the configurational average over the distribution of @xmath19 of the number @xmath20 of frustrated plaquettes  @xcite .",
    "note that the concentration of ferromagnetic bonds is denoted by @xmath5 and the periodic boundary condition is assumed .",
    "we have @xmath21_{p } & = \\bigg [ \\sum_{\\textrm{c } } \\frac{1}{2 } \\bigg(1 - \\prod_{<ij > \\in c } \\frac{j_{ij}}{j } \\bigg ) \\bigg]_{p } \\\\ & = \\frac{n}{2 } \\ { 1 - ( 2p - 1 ) ^{4 } \\ } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the number of spins and @xmath23_{p}$ ] denotes the configurational average with @xmath5 .",
    "the number of plaquettes is equal to the number of spins on the square lattice .",
    "the summation has run over all plaquettes @xmath12 .",
    "we next differentiate @xmath24 with respect to the average number @xmath25 of antiferromagnet bonds , which is equal to @xmath26 in the case of the square lattice , to calculate the change in the number of frustrated plaquettes by the increase in the number of antiferromagnetic bonds .",
    "the resulting derivative is @xmath27^{-1 } \\frac{d",
    "n_{f}^{\\textrm{sq}}(p)}{d p } = 2 ( 2p - 1 ) ^3 .",
    "\\label{eq : v}\\ ] ] this quantity @xmath28 expresses the ratio of the increase in the number of frustrated plaquettes to that in the number of antiferromagnetic bonds .    when @xmath29 , the increase in the number of frustrated plaquettes is larger than that in the number of antiferromagnetic bonds . when @xmath30 , the converse is realized .",
    "there is a turning point where the increase in the number of frustrated plaquettes is equal to that in the number of antiferromagnetic bonds .",
    "it is identified with the point @xmath31 , where @xmath32 this value is very close to the phase transition point at zero temperature estimated by other numerical approaches ( table  [ table : values2d ] ) .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     comparing the result for the triangular lattice with the results for the models with the two - body interactions on the triangular and hexagonal lattices shown in table  [ table : values2d ] , we find that our argument properly distinguishes the number of bodies in the couplings .",
    "in particular , the difference between the three - body @xmath1 model on the triangular lattice and the two - body @xmath1 model on the hexagonal lattice is worthy of attention , since the units of frustration in these two models have the same shape .",
    "this coincidence leads to the same term @xmath33 in both functions @xmath34 accordingly .",
    "the coefficients of the terms , @xmath35 in the three - body @xmath1 model and @xmath36 in the two - body @xmath1 model , generate an appropriate difference in the results .",
    "the coefficients express the increment of frustrated units by an additional negative coupling to the perfect pure system .",
    "we investigate the standard infinite - range model in spin glasses called the sk model  @xcite , @xmath37 where any two spins interact with each other .",
    "the couplings @xmath3 are governed by the gaussian distribution , @xmath38 , \\label{eq : gauss}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 denotes the number of spins , and @xmath22 is introduced in the distribution to make the resulting extensive quantities proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "we consider the number of frustrated plaquettes .",
    "a plaquette in this model is a triangle composed of three bonds .",
    "since quenched variables @xmath3 can take arbitrary real values , their product over a plaquette also takes arbitrary values .",
    "however , we do not take account of the magnitude of the product .",
    "our attention is focused on whether or not a plaquette is frustrated .",
    "this is one of the methods of generalizing the method developed in previous cases .",
    "the average number of frustrated plaquettes is represented as @xmath39_{j_{0 } } \\\\ & = \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6 } \\\\ & \\hspace{1 cm } \\times \\frac{1}{2 } \\bigg\\ { 1 - \\bigg [ \\textrm{erf } \\left ( \\frac{j_{0}}{\\sqrt{2n } } \\right ) \\bigg]^{3 } \\bigg\\ } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 expresses the number of plaquettes equal to the number of combinations of three arbitrary sites on the lattice , and @xmath41 is the error function @xmath42.\\ ] ] the average number of antiferromagnetic bonds is @xmath43.\\ ] ] in the infinite - volume limit @xmath44 , the derivative of @xmath45 with respect to @xmath46 is @xmath47^{-1 } \\frac{d n_{f}^{\\textrm{sk}}(j_{0})}{d j_{0 } } = \\frac{2}{\\pi } j_{0}^{2}. % \\end{split}\\ ] ] the solution of the equation @xmath48 is @xmath49 .",
    "this result is not in agreement with the well - known exact transition point at zero temperature @xmath50  @xcite , but is identical to the transition point under the assumption of replica symmetry  @xcite , which is derived from the equation of state of the ferromagnetic order parameter @xmath51 at zero temperature : @xmath52 this equation has a solution with @xmath53 if the slope of the function on the right - hand side at @xmath54 , which is @xmath55 , is larger than @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , the phase transition point is determined by @xmath57 , which is identical to the condition in our argument . our result with frustration accords with the replica - symmetric solution not only in the solution but also in the equation for the determination of the transition point",
    "we have reported the relationship between frustration and the transition point of ising spin glasses .",
    "the relation reveals that the concentration of ferromagnetic bonds in the system is rather close to the critical concentration at zero temperature when the derivative of the average number of frustrated plaquettes with respect to the average number of antiferromagnetic bonds is equal to unity .",
    "this relation is confirmed in various models . in particular , the cases in the two - dimensional lattices show good correspondence . in the sk model ,",
    "the solution derived from our argument is in exact agreement with the transition point under the assumption of replica symmetry , and the slope of the average number of frustrated plaquettes corresponds to the slope of the function in the equation of state of the ferromagnetic order parameter at zero temperature .",
    "although we have detected no conventional sign of phase transitions , the agreements between our values and the transition points are naturally regarded not to be accidental .",
    "one of the reasons is that our argument attains pretty accurate predictions in most of the models that we have applied the method to .",
    "the variety of models in which the agreements are found is particularly remarkable .",
    "our argument is , thus , expected to yield approximate locations of the transition points .",
    "our approach to spin glasses by means of frustration is novel and different from conventional ones .",
    "the representative conventional study is an attempt to characterize phases in terms of the change in the free energy by increasing frustration  @xcite .",
    "both our study and the conventional one focus on the change of frustration to discuss phases .",
    "hence , they might have a deep connection , but we have not found it yet . it is notable that our approach enables us to extract the approximate locations of the transition points specifically , which is difficult for conventional ones .",
    "furthermore , it is remarkable that the result for the sk model , which corresponds not to the exact solution but to the replica symmetric one , shows deep significance of the deviation from the exact solution .",
    "this result suggests that we should not disregard the gap between our solution of @xmath58 and the exact one as a simple defect of our method .",
    "moreover , the correspondence of @xmath59 and the slope of the equation of state provides an insight into our heuristic condition @xmath58 . also , in other cases , @xmath60 is expected to be concerned with the slope of the equation of state under some assumption such as that of replica symmetry .",
    "the simplicity of our calculation in contrast with the accuracy of the results has practical use in the context of topological quantum error - correcting codes , where the accuracy threshold corresponds to the phase boundary of spin glasses  @xcite .",
    "our method is useful for the first approximation of the accuracy threshold .",
    "the simplicity , moreover , illuminates the unknown elegant physics in spin glasses , which is usually regarded as a complex subject .",
    "since we have considered only frustration to discuss phase transitions , our result seems to support the conjecture on the geometry - induced phase transition  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , our values are different from the expected locations from the conjecture  @xcite .",
    "the reason is that we have observed the number of frustrated plaquettes , whereas the entropy of frustration distribution has been considered in the conjecture  @xcite .",
    "our result suggests the existence of the geometry - induced phase transition , but it does not support the proposition that the root of the transition at zero temperature is a singularity in the entropy of frustration distribution .    we should mention higher - dimensional cases .",
    "our method is not limited to the two - dimensional lattices and can be applied to higher - dimensional ones since only the local structure of a lattice , namely bonds and plaquettes , is needed to execute our scheme . in the three - dimensional cubic lattice , for example , a plaquette consists of four bonds as in the square lattice , and we have a function @xmath61 for the @xmath1 ising model with the two - body interactions .",
    "the condition @xmath62 yields the value @xmath63 , while a numerical study  @xcite estimates the transition point at zero temperature to be @xmath64 .",
    "the two values are not so close , but our calculation gives a fairly good approximate value despite its simplicity .",
    "this result demonstrates the usefulness of our method for the higher - dimensional cases , where duality transformation , one of the standard tools to derive the locations of transition points , can not be used basically .",
    "since our results suggest the relationship among frustration , phases , and the replica symmetry , the origin of the correspondence between our results from frustration and the transition points at zero temperature might lead to clarifying the fruitful structure behind spin glasses in general .",
    "the origin is , however , not obvious yet . to clarify it ,",
    "further investigation is necessary . in particular",
    ", the lack of an effect from the global structure of lattices and from the nature of spins should be resolved .",
    "it is particularly important to clarify the reason why our results are consistent with the transition points of models with the ising spins .",
    "in addition , the validity of the naive generalization of the method to the higher - dimensional systems including the sk model should be further studied .",
