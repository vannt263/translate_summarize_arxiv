    "the @xmath23 decays are found to be highly suppressed with respect to the similar @xmath0 processes  @xcite .",
    "the suppression can be explained in the framework of the factorization in two - body @xmath2 decays  @xcite , where @xmath1 production is allowed only when one takes into account final state interactions .",

    "a study of the multi - body @xmath2 decay modes with @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the final state is important to understand the detailed dynamics of @xmath2 meson decays .",
