    "two kinds of behavior are possible in this simplified model : for inclinations of less than 39.23@xmath12 ( or higher than 140.77@xmath12 for retrograde satellites ) , the argument of pericenter freely circulates from 0@xmath12 to 360@xmath12 , while at intermediate inclinations a new class of solutions , in which the argument of pericenter librates around @xmath1390@xmath12 , are possible .",
    "such behavior is called the kozai resonance .",
    "the value of the critical inclination of 39.23@xmath12 is , in fact , an artifact of the averaging ; the real boundary between the region in which libration is possible or not is actually a more complicated function of the satellite s semimajor axis and eccentricity ( uk _ et al .",
    "_ 2003 , uk and burns 2004 ) . currently , six irregular satellites of jovian planets are known numerically to be in the kozai secular resonance : two around saturn ( s/2000 s5 kiviuq , and s/2000 s6 ijiraq ) , two around jupiter ( s/2001 j10 euporie , and s/2003 j20 ) , and two around neptune ( s/2002 n2 and s/2002 n4 , holman _",
    "2004 ) . a third neptunian satellite , s/2003 n1 is on a chaotic orbit that may also be in the kozai resonance ( holman _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ) .",
    "a question that carruba _",
    "et al . _ left unanswered regarded the possible presence of chaos and chaotic diffusion at the separatrix between the regions of circulation and libration . since in that work the authors considered a three - body problem , but averaged over the mean anomalies of both perturber and perturbee , our analytical model was an integrable one - degree of freedom model .",
    "in the real system , however , perturbations from other jovian planets and short - period terms may produce chaos near the kozai separatrix .",
    "chaotic evolution might lead to the escape of objects whose orbits were originally inside the kozai resonance . here",
    "we test the hypothesis that the chaotic layer is due to the fact that the kozai resonance overlaps with secondary resonances near the separatrix .",
    "it is well known that resonance overlap is one of the major sources of chaos in dynamical systems ( chirikov 1979 ) .",
    "moreover , the positions of the planets may have changed after their formation , due to gravitational scattering of planetesimals ( malhotra 1995 ) . as a consequence of the different planetary positions , the shape of the chaotic layer and the locations of the secondary resonances inside and outside the kozai resonance should have been different in the past .",
    "this might have had consequences on the stability of any primordial population of kozai resonators .",
    "this paper will concentrate on identifying the chaotic layer at the transition between circulation and libration for kozai resonators , in particular for the saturnian satellite kiviuq , whose orbit is very close to the separatrix of the kozai resonance .",
    "our goal is to understand the origins of chaos and the effects of planetary migration .",
    "our investigation is divided in the following way : section 2 describes the major features of our simplified model of the kozai resonance and identifies the transition region between circulation and libration .",
    "section 3 recalls two methods to identify chaotic behavior in dynamical systems , the frequency analysis method and the maximum lyapunov exponents .",
    "section 4 investigates possible causes of the chaotic layer .",
    "section 5 shows how the kozai resonance is crossed by a series of secondary resonances of different strengths . in the final section",
    "we demonstrate how the effect of planetary migration , combined with the effect of the secondary resonances , might have operated to depopulate a possible primordial satellite group of kozai resonators .",
    "carruba _ et al . _",
    "( 2002 ) described a simple analytical model of the kozai resonance .",
    "this model is based on a development of the disturbing function in a series of @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the radial planetocentric distances of the satellite and the sun , truncated at the second order .",
    "the perturbing function @xmath17 is :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the gravitational constant , @xmath20 is the solar mass , @xmath21 is the angle between directions to the satellite and the sun as seen from the planet , and @xmath22 is the second - order legendre polynomial .",
    "the perturbing function , when averaged over the mean anomalies of both sun and satellite , becomes :    @xmath23 , \\label{eq : 4_2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the semimajor axis , eccentricity , and inclination of the satellite , respectively .",
    "@xmath26 is the sun s semiminor axis .",
    "the perturbing function , when expressed in terms of delaunay elements ( @xmath27 ; see murray and dermott 1999 , danby 1988 ) , is :    @xmath28 .",
    "\\label{eq : 4_3}\\ ] ]    since both @xmath29 and @xmath30 are cyclic , the conjugate quantities @xmath31 and @xmath32 are constants of the motion , as is the quantity :    @xmath33    with @xmath31 and @xmath32 fixed , the perturbing function ( [ eq : 4_3 ] ) represents a one - degree of freedom model for the kozai resonance ( innanen _ et al .",
    "the following equations for the orbital elements hold :    @xmath34,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 and t is time .",
    "the time has been rescaled in this way to eliminate the equations dependency on the satellite s semimajor axis .",
    "kinoshita and nakai ( 1999 ) found the solution of ( 5 - 7 ) in terms of elliptic functions .",
    "[ fig : c_fig1 ] shows the results of numerical integrations of equations ( 5 - 7 ) for @xmath36 and @xmath37 . for @xmath38 less than 0.6 ,",
    "librating solutions are possible .",
    "this model has several limitations .",
    "first , short - period terms have been eliminated by averaging .",
    "one consequence of this averaging is that the limit between the zones in which libration is possible or not is @xmath39 ( or @xmath40 for retrograde orbits ) , regardless of the satellite s semimajor axis ( both inclinations correspond to @xmath38 = 0.6 for @xmath41 ) .",
    "when short - period terms are included , the boundary shifts slightly ( uk and burns 2004 ) . a case where this is observed is the orbit of the jovian satellite euporie that is a kozai resonator but has @xmath42 .",
    "a second limitation of the averaged model is that , since it is an integrable , one - degree - of - freedom model , no chaos can appear at the separatrix between circulation and libration . finally , since mutual perturbations among jovian planets are ignored , the orbital elements of the planet about which the satellites circle are constant . in the real solar system ,",
    "the eccentricities of jupiter and saturn vary with several prominent periods associated with the secular frequencies @xmath7 and @xmath43 ( timescales of up to @xmath44 yr ) , great - inequality terms @xmath45 , where the suffices j and s hereafter stand for jupiter and saturn , ( with a timescale of 883 yr ) , and short - period frequencies , connected with the orbital periods of the planets ( 12.5 and 29.7 yrs for jupiter and saturn , respectively ) .",
    "the shape of the separatrix may change in time according to the variations of the planet s eccentricity and semimajor axis ( remember the presence of the factor @xmath46 in @xmath47 ) which might introduce chaos along the real system s separatrix .    to understand the behavior of the real system , we concentrate on the case of kiviuq , a saturnian satellite in kozai resonance whose orbit is very close to the separatrix between libration and circulation in @xmath0 .",
    "we start by numerically searching for the transition between circulation and libration .",
    "to do so , we used the following procedure : we numerically integrated kiviuq s orbit over 100,000 yrs and found the maximum eccentricity , because then the satellite is closest to the separatrix .",
    "we computed @xmath38 according to the inclination of kiviuq at that time , and generated a grid of initial conditions for test particles ; this contains 19 values in @xmath0 , from @xmath48 to @xmath49 , separated by @xmath50 .",
    "all particles were given the average value of kiviuq s semimajor axis during the integration ( @xmath51 au ) , and a grid in inclination with 21 values , starting at @xmath52 with a step of @xmath53 .",
    "the values of the eccentricities were computed from @xmath54 .",
    "initial @xmath6 and @xmath55 ( mean anomaly ) are equal to those of kiviuq at its maximum eccentricity .",
    "this grid forms our `` low - resolution survey '' .",
    "these initial orbits were integrated for 2 myr under the influence of the four jovian planets ( outer solar system , oss hereafter ) with a modified version of swift - whm , the integrator that uses the wisdom and holman ( 1991 ) mapping in the swift package ( levison and duncan 2000 ) .",
    "we modified the integrator so that the planets orbits are integrated in the heliocentric system and the particles orbits are integrated in the planetocentric reference frame .",
    "this setup minimizes the integration error ( nesvorn _ et al .",
    "_ 2003 ) .    to more easily identify secular oscillations in saturn s inclination",
    ", we refer all the positions to saturn s initial orbital plane .",
    "[ fig : particles_fate ] shows the results of our simulations for our low - resolution survey . the actual separation between circulating and librating behavior",
    "does not follow the solution of the secular model when the full perturbations from jovian planets are considered .",
    "moreover , some orbits alternate between circulation and libration ( and , in a few cases , spend some time in the other libration island around @xmath56 ) .",
    "the question that remains to be answered is whether there is a chaotic layer near the separatrix , and if chaotic diffusion might be effective in depleting a primordial population of kozai resonators . to address this question , and identify chaos",
    ", we will use the frequency analysis method ( fam , hereafter ; laskar , 1990 ) , and will compute the maximum lyapunov exponents ( mle hereafter ; benettin _ et al .",
    "_ , 1980 ) which we now describe .",
    "the frequency analysis method ( fam ) is essentially an analysis of the frequency power spectrum of appropriate combinations of numerically determined orbital elements . in our case ,",
    "for example , we are interested in the frequency related to the precession of the argument of the pericenter @xmath0 . fig .  [",
    "fig : periods ] shows the periods in @xmath0 for the particles in our low - resolution survey .",
    "the periods peak sharply in the transition region from circulation to libration in @xmath0 , reaching a maximum of 1800 yrs .",
    "the minimum libration period is 480 yrs .",
    "the average period of libration in the kozai resonance in our survey is 640 yrs .",
    "this range in periods corresponds to a frequency range of @xmath57 700 - 3200   /yr .",
    "we took the fourier transform of @xmath58 ( where @xmath59 ) over two time intervals ( 0 - 1 myr and 1 - 2 myr ) and computed the quantity :    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the frequency over the first interval and @xmath62 the corresponding frequency on the second interval .",
    "if the motion is regular , @xmath63 will be nearly constant , with small variations produced by errors in the determination of the frequencies ( to be discussed later in this section ) .",
    "if the motion is chaotic , variations in @xmath64 will be related to changes in @xmath0 s precession period .    while this is the main idea behind the fam ,",
    "a few complications occur .",
    "first , the precision of a fast fourier transform ( fft hereafter ) is limited by its coarse resolution [ @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the ( constant ) time separation of @xmath0-sampling and n is the number of data points used , which must be a power of 2 ( press _ et al . _ 1996 ) ] in recovering the frequencies having the largest amplitude . to overcome this problem",
    ", we used the frequency modified fourier transform method ( fmft ) , with quadratic corrections ( idlichovsky and nesvorn 1997 ) , which allows us to retrieve the frequencies with the largest amplitude to a better precision . to estimate the error associated with this method , we computed the frequencies with and without quadratic corrections , and computed the average value of the differences in @xmath64 .",
    "this procedure gives an upper limit on the error . in our case , the average error of fmft was @xmath67 , while a simple fft had a resolution of @xmath68 ( we used a time step @xmath66=30 yr , and 32,768 data points , so that each interval for the determination of the frequencies was @xmath57 1  myr ) .",
    "another problem to take into account is _ aliasing_. the fft can recover frequencies up to the nyquist frequency ( @xmath69 , that corresponds to two samplings per period ) .",
    "frequencies higher than the nyquist frequency are not lost , but are mapped into a smaller apparent value of @xmath70 , given by @xmath71 .",
    "this phenomenon is called aliasing and can be easily understood by considering a sinusoidal wave , sampled at isolated points : at least two points per period are needed to obtain a good estimate of the period .",
    "if the sampling is longer than one period , than the retrieved period is larger , and its `` ghost '' signature may appear in the frequency range of interest .",
    "to avoid this problem , we used an `` on - line '' low - pass filter , following the procedure of quinn _ et al . _",
    "( 1991 ) ( based on the work of carpino _ et al .",
    "our filter suppresses to a level of @xmath72 all fourier terms with periods smaller than 66.7 yr ( stop - band ) , and attenuates to a level of @xmath72 all fourier terms with periods between 66.7 and 200 yr .",
    "terms with periods larger than 200 yrs are in the passband ( see added information on website ) . by following this procedure ,",
    "we have eliminated all frequencies connected with the orbital periods of saturn and the satellites .",
    "finally , the shape of the frequency peaks can be modeled as gaussian , but our measurements are made at isolated points .",
    "this introduces what in signal processing is called `` impulse noise '' , which can be attenuated by the use of a median filter ( press _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , pitas 2000 ) .",
    "more details about the use of the median filter and of the @xmath73 test we devised to prove the efficacy of our filter can be found in the appendix .",
    "to find an alternate way to distinguish between regular and chaotic behavior , we also computed maximum lyapunov exponents ( mle ) for our set of initial conditions .",
    "a detailed explanation of the theory of lyapunov exponents goes beyond the scope of this paper ; instead we refer the reader to lyapunov ( 1907 ) and benettin _ et al . _",
    "mle is a measure of exponential stretching of nearby orbits .",
    "the lyapunov exponents are equal to zero for regular orbits ( they tend to zero in finite - time calculations ) , while they assume positive values for chaotic orbits .",
    "the inverse of a lyapunov exponent is the lyapunov time @xmath74 .",
    "smaller values of @xmath74 indicate enhanced local stochasticity .    to estimate mle for orbits we used a modified version of swift - lyap2 , a code that integrates the difference equation ( morbidelli 2002 ) in the swift package ( levison and duncan 1994 ) .",
    "the code was modified to reduce the integration error by integrating the planets in the heliocentric frame and the satellites in the planetocentric frame . for each of the test particles",
    ", we integrated the difference equation with an initial difference vector of modulus @xmath75 and determined the modulus @xmath76 of the displacement vector between the two vectors at time t. we constructed a series @xmath77}$ ] and performed a linear least - squares fit on this series . since @xmath78 , where @xmath31 is the lyapunov exponent , the slope of @xmath79}$ ] versus time is equal to the maximum lyapunov exponent .",
    "we computed the lyapunov exponents for all orbits in our low - resolution survey .",
    "we will show these results in the following section .",
    "we should point out that fam and mle , while both useful tools to investigate chaotic behavior , measure different things .",
    "fam measures macroscopic changes in frequencies ( i.e. , the speed at which chaotic motion changes the frequencies ) , while @xmath74 measures the rate of exponential stretching of nearby trajectories .",
    "these two techniques are complementary : fam is more practical in finding regions that are macroscopically unstable , and @xmath74 can reveal the presence of different chaos - generating mechanisms",
    ". we will discuss in more detail these aspects of the two methods in the following section .",
    "to investigate the presence of chaos , we applied the fam to our low - resolution survey , integrated under the influence of the four jovian planets .",
    "[ fig : fig_lr1 ] plots @xmath80 for our low - resolution survey when the time interval between the first and the second frequencies was about 1 myr . fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_lr1 ] shows that high values of @xmath64 are found near the actual separatrix .",
    "the chaotic layer is asymmetric between values of @xmath81 versus @xmath82 , and kiviuq seems to be on the border of the chaotic layer .",
    "having shown that a chaotic layer exists , the next logical step is to ascertain its origin(s ) .",
    "let us recall the analytical model presented in section 2 .",
    "in that model , the shape of the separatrix depends on saturn s semiminor axis @xmath83 , which is a function of the semimajor axis and the eccentricity .",
    "variations in saturn s semimajor axis and eccentricity may therefore generate complex orbital evolution near the separatrix .",
    "but on what time - scales ? and how can we prove this hypothesis ?    to study whether a variable @xmath83 may generate chaos , we performed a numerical simulation with the sun ( saturn ) on an orbit of fixed eccentricity ( equal to the average value of the saturnian eccentricity ) and the set of test particles used for our low - resolution survey .",
    "the difference compared to the integrable model is the presence of short - period terms .",
    "we performed the fam on test orbits in our low - resolution survey and found that all orbits are regular in this case .",
    "in contrast , when only saturn and the sun were present , and saturn had a constant eccentricity equal to the mean value computed during the 46,000 yr period of oscillation (= @xmath84 ) , no chaos was observed .",
    "this seems to confirm our intuition that variations in saturn s eccentricity and semimajor axis may be responsible for the chaotic layer .    to test this hypothesis",
    ", we performed a simulation in which both saturn and jupiter are present . in this case",
    "the layer of chaos appears ( fig .",
    "[ fig : saturn alone ] ) .",
    "the similarity between figs .",
    "[ fig : fig_lr1 ] and  [ fig : saturn alone ] suggest that the effects of uranus and neptune are unimportant .",
    "to demonstrate this , we performed two simulations with our low - resolution survey , one with the complete outer solar system ( oss ) , and the other with just jupiter and saturn . to show that the results are nearly equal we applied the @xmath73 test ( see appendix ) to the filtered results of both simulations .",
    "we obtained a value of @xmath73 of 22.4 ( out of a maximum number of 399 ) indicating a very high probability that the two distributions are the same .",
    "while perturbations from uranus and neptune might play a role in modifying the chaotic layer , such perturbations are clearly less important than jovian perturbations .",
    "so , in the following , we only consider jovian perturbations . in",
    "doing so we of course modify the values of planetary frequencies and mean motions , and therefore the positions of any secondary resonances .",
    "but , since in this phase of our work we are interested in understanding on what timescales the chaotic behavior is driven , we believe this is an acceptable approximation .",
    "there are two prominent timescales for oscillations of saturn s @xmath85 and @xmath86 : the secular oscillations ( period of order @xmath87 yrs ) and the oscillations related to the great inequality ( 883 yrs ) . to study which of these perturbations is more relevant to the origin of chaos",
    ", we describe the oss orbital evolution , in terms of fourier series ( bretagnon and francou 1988 ) . in this model ,",
    "the equinoctial orbital elements ( @xmath88 ) are developed in series of cosines and sines of combinations of twelve angles : four mean longitudes of the giant planets , four proper longitudes of pericenter , and four proper longitudes of the nodes .",
    "these proper angles are linear functions of time .",
    "this model assures a fractional precision better than @xmath89 for @xmath90 and p over 10 myr .    to investigate what minimal model can create a chaotic layer similar to the one observed in the full problem , we used different solutions for the orbits of both jupiter and saturn .",
    "we modified our version of swift - whm so that both orbital evolutions of jupiter and saturn are computed `` on - line '' according to the bretagnon secular solution .",
    "the test particles are then subjected to perturbations of planets that evolve on such orbits .",
    "we considered four models for saturn s orbital evolution : ( 1 ) sec , in which we limit the expansion to terms containing the @xmath91 and @xmath9 frequencies for @xmath92 and @xmath93 , assume a constant semimajor axis , and take 12 terms for @xmath94 s development .",
    "( 2 ) a21sec , in which we have included 12 terms associated with the 1:2 commensurability between jupiter s and saturn s mean motions , and terms associated with the great inequality for the development in _ a _ , plus the same terms as in the sec solution .",
    "( 3 ) gisec , in which there were 8 terms for @xmath95 and @xmath32 , and 6 for @xmath93 and @xmath96 associated with the great inequality , and a constant semimajor axis ; and ( 4 ) a21gisec , which includes the 2:1 terms in _ a _ , the great - inequality terms and the secular variations .",
    "table  [ table : bret_model ] gives the number of terms taken in @xmath97 for each solution .",
    "[ fig : sec ] shows the results of the integration with these models .",
    "all simulations used the same solution for jupiter ( 10 terms in the development of @xmath86 , 2 terms for @xmath95 and @xmath32 , 2 for @xmath96 and @xmath93 , and 12 for @xmath94 ) .",
    "these figures may be compared with fig .",
    "[ fig : saturn alone ] , where the traditional version of swift - whm was used .",
    "table  [ table : bret_res ] presents the results of a @xmath73 test in which we compared simulations with `` bretagnon '' models with those of the full integration of jupiter and saturn . according to these results , terms associated with the great inequality and",
    "the 2:1 terms in the development of saturn s semimajor axis are the most important for the presence of the chaotic layer .",
    "the major sources for chaos are the variations in saturn s eccentricity connected with the great inequality .    to further investigate this hypothesis , we computed the maximum lyapunov exponent for the particles of our low - resolution survey , in a model containing jupiter and saturn .",
    "[ fig : lyap_time ] shows the resulting values of @xmath74 ( left ) when the full problem is considered and ( right ) when the planets evolve according to the sec solution .",
    "a remarkable asset of fig .",
    "[ fig : lyap_time]a is the region of high values of @xmath74 ( i.e. , a smaller degree of local stochasticity ) near the vertex of the separatrix , which , according to the fam , is a region of high dispersion of the frequencies . in this region",
    "@xmath98 yrs , i.e. , twice the period of the great inequality ; thus our results suggest that the feature is connected to a secondary resonance with the great inequality .",
    "note , however , that all orbits seem to have quite small values of @xmath74 . orbits inside the libration island , which , according to fam , are macroscopically regular , have @xmath99 yrs .",
    "this appears to be a general characteristic of high - inclination irregular satellite orbits , as all seem to have @xmath100 yrs ( m. holman , private communication , 2003 ) .",
    "the existence of a region characterized by relatively long lyapunov times , on one hand , but high frequency dispersion , on the other , seems counter - intuitive at first .",
    "however , recall that the rate of frequency dispersion is a macroscopic characteristic of the orbit that is related to the global structure of the phase space region . in contrast",
    ", the lyapunov time is a local property whose value is dictated by the mechanism that is responsible for the chaotic motion .",
    "the existence of regions of large @xmath74 but rapid diffusion is not uncommon in the asteroid belt .",
    "for example , in the 7/3 resonance ( see tsiganis _",
    "et al . _ , 2003 ) , the smaller values of @xmath74 are observed at the borders of the resonance where they are related to the pulsation of the separatrix due to secular precession .",
    "however , the macroscopically most unstable region is located at smaller libration amplitudes , is characterized by larger values of @xmath74 , and is related to the colocation of the @xmath101 secular resonance .",
    "similar results can be shown for other low - order mean - motion resonances ( e.g. , 2:1 and 3:1 ) , where the most unstable zones are generated by coexisting secular resonances . as @xmath74 s value is typically of the order of the forcing period ( e.g. , @xmath102 yrs , @xmath103 yrs , tsiganis and morbidelli 2004 ) , these regions generally have higher values of @xmath74 than the region associated with the pulsating separatrix of the mean - motion resonance .",
    "we are likely observing a similar phenomenon in the case studied here .",
    "we believe that this high-@xmath74 region is associated with a secondary resonance , involving the great - inequality period .",
    "this is also supported by the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lyap_time]b ( sec solution ) , where all orbits inside the libration zone become regular ( note the different scale compared to fig .  [",
    "fig : lyap_time]a ) . to further support our claim , we selected a particle from this high-@xmath74 region , for which we plot the time evolution of the argument @xmath104 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : resonant_arguments ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to one of the possible critical arguments of the 1:1 resonance between the frequency of @xmath105 and the frequency of the great inequality , @xmath106 ( @xmath107 is added in order to fulfill the d alembert rules of permissible arguments , i.e. , the sum of coefficients of individual longitudes must be zero and the sum of coefficients of nodal longitudes be even ) .",
    "the behavior of the arguments switches erratically between intervals of libration and circulation , which indicates a transition through the separatrix of this secondary resonance .",
    "the following picture arises from our low - resolution surveys .",
    "two major sources of chaos exist in the system .",
    "one is connected to the transition region from circulation to libration and , in particular , is driven by variations in saturn s eccentricity , mainly associated with great - inequality terms , and variations in saturn s semimajor axis .",
    "the other is related to a secondary resonance involving the argument of pericenter @xmath0 and the great - inequality terms for circulating particles . in most cases",
    "this resonance is a stronger source of chaos than the transition region .",
    "better resolution is needed to understand the behavior and shape of this resonance ( see sec . 5 ) .",
    "one problem that remains to be explained is the asymmetry of the chaotic layer with respect to @xmath108 ( see figs .",
    "according to the secular model , the result should be symmetric .",
    "our simulations with the bretagnon model suggest that variations in saturn s semimajor axis may be partly responsible for the asymmetry .",
    "alternatively , the asymmetry in the chaotic layer may be related to our choice of initial conditions . to exclude this second possibility",
    ", we need to ascertain that our choice of initial conditions ( @xmath6 and @xmath55 ) for the test particles orbits is not introducing spurious effects . to our knowledge , three resonant configurations may alter the eccentricities of the test particles , and so put their orbits closer or farther away from the region of chaos that we are interested in .",
    "the three resonances are : `` nodal '' ( @xmath109constant ) , pericentric ( @xmath110 ) , and the evection inequality [ @xmath111constant ( @xmath112 , so as to have an intermediate value of the evection angle ) as evection inequality . ] . in our simulation ,",

    ", we used two values of the resonant argument : @xmath115 and ( yokoyama _ et al . _ , 2003 ) , @xmath116 , @xmath117 .",
    "the second configuration maximizes the perturbing effect of the pericentric resonance .    to have a quantitative measure of the asymmetry",
    ", we use an `` asymmetry coefficient '' that is the difference of @xmath64 s values for @xmath0 larger and smaller than @xmath118 . to compute this coefficient for orbits in the libration island ( @xmath119 ) , we take two columns symmetric about @xmath108 ( e.g. , the columns for @xmath120 and @xmath121 , with the obvious exclusion of the column for @xmath108 ) and compute the fractional difference for each pair .",

    "we explain these results in the following way : when , owing to the planets migration , the secondary resonance s period approaches @xmath179 yrs , a few of the particle inside the kozai resonance ( but only a fraction , the process is not 100% efficient ) are captured into a secondary resonance , and move further out in the libration island until the secondary - resonance s period attains @xmath180 yrs . for such libration periods , the orbits are so close to the separatrix that escape becomes possible .",

    "fig : periods ] ) .",
    "after 5 myr , the growing value of the great - inequality period sweeps fewer and fewer particles inside the kozai resonance , and the mechanism loses its efficacy .",
    "another interesting consideration is that not only librating particles are pushed toward the separatrix , also some circulators in general are captured by one of the secondary resonances and are carried toward the separatrix .",
    "the fact that circulators do not generally become librators is due to the fact that in order to cross the separatrix they have to reach very high values of the precession period in @xmath0 ( see fig .",

    "a word of caution should be given about our results .",
    "we only used a smooth exponential evolution ( malhotra 1995 ) for the planet s migration . in the real solar system things were most likely different from this model ; e.g. , hahn and malhotra ( 2000 ) introduced short - time scale variations in neptune s outward expansion by adding some random jitter to the torque applied to neptune ( cf .",

    ", we can assume that a similar mechanism should be at work , and that any significant amount of short - time variations in the semimajor axes of both jupiter and saturn might in principle reduce the capture efficiency into the great - inequality secondary resonance .",
    "since our work is , in many ways , exploratory , we believe the use of the exponential model is defensible at this stage of our study .",
    "but we acknowledge that a more realistic model for the motions of jupiter s and saturn s semimajor axes should be used , before realistic values of capture probabilities for our mechanism of sweeping secondary resonances could be computed .    in any case",
    ", we believe that our mechanism of sweeping secondary resonances might be an effective scheme for destabilizing the primordial population of bodies originally in the kozai resonance .",
    "the mechanism should not be limited to kiviuq s region .",
    "the fact that the great - inequality s period swept through values starting from 90 yrs at the beginning of the simulation with planetary migration to the current 883 yrs , implies that an analogous mechanism should also have been at work in the regions of the other saturnian and jovian satellites presently in the kozai resonance , for @xmath0 libration periods of less than 1000 yrs .",
    "we have analyzed the orbital behavior of satellites inside and outside the kozai resonance for the phase space around the saturnian satellite kiviuq . our goal was to identify areas of chaotic behavior and to understand if chaotic diffusion might have played an important role , now or in the past , for orbital stability inside the kozai resonance . by applying the frequency analysis method ( fam ) and computing the maximum lyapunov exponents , we identified several secondary resonances .",
    "the major source of chaos for orbits in the circulating region are secondary resonances involving the argument of pericenter @xmath0 (= @xmath141 ) , the great - inequality s argument ( @xmath158 ) , the longitude of the node ( @xmath6 ) , and the planetary secular frequencies ( @xmath184 , and @xmath9 ) .",

    "are what drive the chaotic behavior , especially the transfer from circulation to libration .",
    "while secular variations modulated by the @xmath185 and @xmath9 frequencies are not negligible , once again our results indicate that the dominant effect is connected with perturbations having the great - inequality s period .    also , contrary to what might be expected from the secular model , our results indicate that the chaotic layer at the boundary between circulation and libration is not symmetric , but shows an asymmetry between values of @xmath0 larger and smaller than @xmath118 .",
    "this is a consequence of other perturbations connected with secular pericentric resonance , evection inequality , and variations in saturn s semimajor axis , which are strongly dependent on the initial conditions for particles @xmath186 and the sun s position .",
    "our simulations suggest that the dominant effect is connected with the secular resonance , but variations in saturn s semimajor axis are not entirely negligible .    from our simulations",
    "we can introduce the following scenario for chaotic orbits near kiviuq s kozai resonance . starting from librating orbits close to the libration center ,",
    "we possibly identify two weak secondary resonances of argument @xmath187 and @xmath188 that introduce chaotic behavior .",

    "in addition to that , the dominant source of chaos , excluding the nearby pericentric secular resonance , is connected to a secondary resonance with the great inequality of argument @xmath164 ( these orbits have argument - of - pericenter periods of order 840 yrs ) .",
    "orbits in the region of this secondary resonance show some of the highest @xmath64 values among the test particles we studied .",
    "other secondary resonances connected with the great inequality are also observed .",
    "the fact that the dominant source of chaos for orbits in kiviuq s region is connected with the great - inequality secondary resonance opens interesting perspectives .",
    "it is believed that jovian planets formed in different locations than their current ones , and then migrated by gravitationally scattering the primordial population of planetesimals ( malhotra 1995 ) .",
    "the possibility that planets occupied different semimajor axes in the past has important repercussions , since the great - inequality s period is connected with the osculating semimajor axes of jupiter and saturn .",
    "in particular , when the two planets were closer together , the period of the great inequality was shorter .",
    "we simulated this effect first by changing the position of jupiter so that the great - inequality s period was 640 yrs and 480 yrs , respectively ( `` static integrations '' ) .",
    "these simulations showed that , indeed the position of the great - inequality s secondary resonance shifted higher .",
    "a twin resonance for librating particles appeared when the great - inequality s period equaled the average libration period ( 640 yrs ) , and the minimum ( 480 yrs ) ( this resonance is not visible today because the maximum period of libration inside the kozai resonance is of @xmath189 yrs ) .",
    "then we fully integrated jupiter and saturn with an integrator that simulates planet migration according to the exponential law of malhotra ( 1995 ) .",
    "our results show that a mechanism of sweeping resonances , analogous to the one that operated in the kuiper belt ( malhotra 1995 ) , or inside the 2:1 mean motion resonance with jupiter ( ferraz - mello _ et al . _ 1998 ) must have operated as well inside the kozai resonance .",
    "our simulations show that 15% of the satellites originally inside the kozai resonance became circulators or exhibited switching behavior when planets acquired their final orbits .",
    "indeed several particles were captured into the secondary resonance with the great inequality ( or other secondary resonances ) and , as a consequence , their amplitudes of oscillation in @xmath0 increased until the test particles reached the boundary between circulation and libration , where escape became possible .",
    "several particles on circulating orbits were also pushed toward the separatrix by an analogous mechanism of sweeping secondary resonances ( but none crossed the boundary to become a librator ) .",
    "we believe that a similar mechanism might have acted in the past also for the region of phase space associated with the other jovian satellites currently inside or near the kozai resonance .",
    "this process could explain why so many irregular satellites are currently found near the kozai separatrix ( uk and burns 2004 ) .    in this work we used several numerical tools . in a few cases , like for example the median filter for our fam results",
    ", we introduced a technique , that , while employed in other fields ( for example in remote - sensing and in the analysis of data from martian probes ) , was not , to our knowledge , used previously in celestial mechanics for reducing fam results .",

    "we believe these tools might be useful for other studies , not only for the irregular satellites of jovian planets .",
    "several questions remain that might be the subjects of future research . in this work",
    "we could not compute reliable capture probabilities for the great - inequality resonances when planetary migration is considered , since short - period variations in the semimajor axes of jupiter and saturn should also be taken into account ( hahn and malhotra 2000 , beaug _ et al .",
    ". it would also be interesting to extend our studies to the neighborhoods of the other jovian satellites currently inside the kozai resonance , and see if a web of secondary resonances ( possibly involving the lesser inequality , the 2:1 quasi - resonance between neptune and uranus ) is also present for the case of those neptunian satellites in kozai resonance ( holman _ et al .",

    "we are grateful to thomas loredo , sylvio ferraz - mello , richard rand , doug hamilton , and suniti karunatillake for useful comments and suggestions supported in part by nasa s planetary geology and geophysics program . more information about this work is available at :    http://www.astro.cornell.edu/~valerio/fft .",
    "when measuring frequencies with a fmft , the shape of the frequency peaks can be modeled as gaussian , but our measurements are made at isolated points .",
    "this introduces what in signal processing is called `` impulse noise '' , which can be attenuated by the use of a median filter ( press _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , pitas 2000 ) .",
    "in our case we took data on a running 3x3 matrix ; the value at the central point is the median of the nine elements .",
    "then we moved the matrix by one element and repeated the procedure . to compute values of @xmath64 for points along the boundary of our figure , we added two external rows and columns of points all with values of @xmath64 obtained from the average of all points in the figure . once all elements were computed , we calculated the average of the percentage difference between the values of @xmath64 before and after the median filter was applied .",
    "if the percentage difference was larger than 5@xmath190 , we repeated the procedure until convergence was assured . to test that our median filter is actually removing only noise and not actual data , we devised the following test .",
    "we applied our median filter to one of our low - resolution surveys , until the 5% convegence criterion was fulfilled .",
    "we then computed the difference @xmath191 between filtered ( @xmath192 ) and raw data ( @xmath193 ) , and computed the standard deviation of the difference @xmath194 .",
    "we then generated a fictitious matrix @xmath195 of noise following a gaussian distribution with standard deviation @xmath194 and zero mean , and added this fictitious noise to the filtered data , obtaining a matrix of @xmath64 values @xmath196 .",
    "the median filter was then reapplied to these new data until convergence was assured , and a new matrix @xmath197 obtained .    to compare the two distributions @xmath192 of filtered data and @xmath197 ( data obtained after the filtration of the fictitious noise )",
    ", we devised the following scheme .",
    "we computed a @xmath198 variable , whose expression is given by :      where @xmath200 and @xmath201 are the errors on the values of the filtered data , intended as the difference between raw and filtered data .",
    "the variable so computed is supposed to follow a @xmath73 -like distribution .",
    "the problem is to determine the number of degrees of freedom of the distribution .",
    "this is not just given by the number ( 399 ) of data points in our low - resolution survey since , when taking the median , each value of @xmath64 is connected to the value of at least some of its eight neighbors .",
    "moreover , the process of filtering is applied several times , until convergence is assured , so that the number of degrees of freedom can be substantially smaller than the number of data points , in a way that is very difficult to estimate .",
    "however , as a rule of thumb ,",
    "a value of @xmath198 considerably smaller than 399 is a relatively good measure of a good fit . in the case of our test , the value of @xmath198 was 55 , so we believe our test should be a convincing proof of the validity of our application of the median filter .",
