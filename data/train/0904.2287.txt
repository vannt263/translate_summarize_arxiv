    "the bohmian interpretation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics ( qm ) @xcite is the best known and most successfull attempt to explain quantum phenomena in terms of `` hidden variables '' , that is , objective properties of the system that are well defined even in the absence of measurements . according to this interpretation , particles allways have continuous and deterministic trajectories in spacetime , while all quantum uncertainties are an artefact of the ignorance of the initial particle positions .",
    "the wave function plays an auxiliary role , by acting as a pilot wave that determines motions of particles for given initial positions .    yet , in its current form , the bohmian interpretation is not without difficulties .",
    "an important nontrivial issue is to make the bohmian interpretation of many - particle systems compatible with special relativity .",
    "manifestly relativistic - covariant bohmian equations of motion of many - particle systems have been proposed in @xcite and further studied in @xcite , but for a long time it has not been known how to associate probabilistic predictions with such relativistic - covariant equations of motion .",
    "recently , a progress has been achieved by realizing that the _ a priori _ probability density @xmath1 of a single particle at the space - position @xmath2 at time @xmath3 should _ not _ be interpreted as a probability density in space satisfying @xmath4 , but as a probability density in _ spacetime _ satisfying @xmath5 @xcite . the usual probabilistic interpretation in space",
    "is then recovered as a conditional probability , corresponding to the case in which the time of detection has been observed . for an @xmath0-particle wave function it generalizes to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , such a manifestly relativistic - invariant probabilistic interpretation is compatible with the manifestly relativistic - covariant bohmian equations of motion . in this paper",
    "we confirm this compatibility , through a more careful discussion in appendix [ appb ] .",
    "the main remaining problem is how to make the bohmian interpretation compatible with quantum field theory ( qft ) , which predicts that particles can be created and destructed .",
    "how to make a theory that describes deterministic continuous trajectories compatible with the idea that a trajectory may have a singular point at which the trajectory begins or ends ?",
    "one possibility is to explicitly break the rule of continuous deterministic evolution , by adding an additional equation that specifies stochastic breaking of the trajectories @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to introduce an additional continuously and deterministically evolving hidden variable that specifies effectivity of each particle trajectory @xcite .",
    "however , both possibilities seem rather artificial and contrived . a more elegant possibility is to replace pointlike particles by extended strings , in which case",
    "the bohmian equation of motion automatically contains a continuous deterministic description of particle creation and destruction as string splitting @xcite .",
    "however , string theory is not yet an experimentally confirmed theory , so it would be much more appealing if bohmian mechanics could be made consistent without strings .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to generalize the relativistic - covariant bohmian interpretation of relativistic qm @xcite describing a fixed number of particles , to relativistic qft that describes systems in which the number of particles may change .",
    "it turns out that the natural bohmian equations of motion for particles described by qft automatically describe their creation and destruction , without need to add any additional structure to the theory .",
    "in particular , the new artificial structures that has been added in @xcite or @xcite turn out to be completely unnecessary .",
    "the main new ideas of this paper are introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] in a non - technical and intuitive way .",
    "this section serves as a motivation for styding the technical details developed in the subsequent sections , but a reader not interested in technical details may be satisfied to read this section only .",
    "[ sec3 ] presents in detail several new and many not widely known conceptual and technical results in standard qft that do not depend on the interpretation of quantum theory . as such , this section may be of interest even for readers not interested in interpretations of quantum theory .",
    "the main purpose of this section , however , is to prepare the theoretical framework needed for the physical interpretation studied in the next section .    sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] finally deals with the physical interpretation . the general probabilistic interpretation and its relation to the usual probabilistic rules in practical applications of qft",
    "is discussed first , while a detailed discussion of the interpretation in terms of deterministic particle trajectories ( already indicated in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] ) is delegated to the final part of this section .    finally , the conclusions are drawn in sec .  [ sec5 ] .",
    "in the paper we use units @xmath9 and the metric signature @xmath10 .",
    "in this section we formulate our main ideas in a casual and mathematically non - rigorous way , with the intention to develop an intuitive understanding of our results , and to motivate the formal developments that will be presented in the subsequent sections .    as a simple example , consider a qft state of the form @xmath11 and a 2-particle state @xmath12 .",
    "for example , it may represent an unstable particle for which we do not know if it has already decayed into 2 new particles ( in which case it is described by @xmath12 ) or has not decayed yet ( in which case it is described by @xmath13 ) .",
    "however , it is known that one allways observes either one unstable particle ( the state @xmath13 ) or two decay products ( the state @xmath12 ) .",
    "one never observes the superposition ( [ e2.1 ] ) .",
    "to answer this question , let us try with a bohmian approach .",
    "one can associate a 1-particle wave function @xmath14 with the state @xmath13 and a 2-particle wave function @xmath15 with the state @xmath12 , where @xmath16 is the spacetime position @xmath17 , @xmath18 , of the particle labeled by @xmath19 .",
    "then the state ( [ e2.1 ] ) is represented by a superposition @xmath20 however , the bohmian interpretation of such a superposition will describe _ three _ particle trajectories . on the other hand",
    ", we should observe either one or two particles , not three particles .",
    "how to explain that ?",
    "to understand it intuitively , we find it instructive to first understand an analogous but much simpler problem in bohmian mechanics .",
    "consider a single non - relativistic particle moving in 3 dimensions .",
    "its wave function is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and the time - dependence is suppressed .",
    "now let us assume that the particle can be observed to move either along the @xmath23 direction ( in which case it is described by @xmath24 ) or on the @xmath25-@xmath26 plane ( in which case it is described by @xmath27 ) .",
    "in other words , the particle is observed to move either in one dimension or two dimensions , but never in all three dimensions .",
    "but if we do not know which of these two possibilities will be realized , we describe the system by a superposition @xmath28 however , the bohmian interpretation of the superposition ( [ e2.3 ] ) will lead to a particle that moves in all three dimensions . on the other hand , we should observe that the particle moves either in one dimension or two dimensions .",
    "the formal analogy with the many - particle problem above is obvious .",
    "fortunately , it is very well known how to solve this analogous problem involving one particle that should move either in one or two dimensions .",
    "the key is to take into account the properties of the _ measuring apparatus_. if it is true that one allways observes that the particle moves either in one or two dimensions , then the total wave function describing the entanglement between the measured particle and the measuring apparatus is not ( [ e2.3 ] ) but @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a position - variable that describes the configuration of the measuring apparatus .",
    "the wave functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 do not overlap .",
    "hence , if @xmath30 takes a value @xmath33 in the support of @xmath34 , then this value is not in the support of @xmath35 , i.e. , @xmath36 .",
    "consequently , the motion of the measured particle is described by the conditional wave function @xcite @xmath37 .",
    "the effect is the same as if ( [ e2.3 ] ) collapsed to @xmath27 .",
    "now essentially the same reasoning can be applied to the superposition ( [ e2.2 ] ) .",
    "if the number of particles is measured , then instead of ( [ e2.2 ] ) we actually have a wave function of the form @xmath38 the detector wave functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 do not overlap . hence , if the particle counter is found in the state @xmath34 , then the measured system originally described by ( [ e2.2 ] ) is effectively described by @xmath15 .",
    "now , what happens with the particle having the spacetime position @xmath39 ?",
    "in general , its motion in spacetime may be expected to be described by the relativistic bohmian equation of motion @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is an auxiliary scalar parameter along the trajectory . however ,",
    "in our case the effective wave function does not depend on @xmath39 , i.e. , the derivatives in ( [ e2.6 ] ) vanish .",
    "consequently , all 4 components of the 4-velocity ( [ e2.6 ] ) are zero .",
    "the particle does not change its spacetime position @xmath42 .",
    "it is an object without an extension not only in space , but also in time .",
    "it can be thought of as a pointlike particle that exists only at one instant of time @xmath43 .",
    "it lives too short to be detected .",
    "effectively , this particle behaves as if it did not exist at all .",
    "now consider a more realistic variation of the measuring procedure , taking into account the fact that the measured particles become entangled with the measuring apparatus at some finite time @xmath44 . before that , the wave function of the measured particles is really well described by ( [ e2.2 ] ) .",
    "thus , before the interaction with the measuring apparatus , all 3 particles described by ( [ e2.2 ] ) have continuous trajectories in spacetime .",
    "all 3 particles exist .",
    "but at time @xmath44 , the total wave function significantly changes .",
    "either ( i ) @xmath30 takes a value from the support of @xmath34 in which case @xmath45 becomes zero , or ( ii ) @xmath30 takes a value from the support of @xmath35 in which case @xmath46 and @xmath47 become zero .",
    "after time @xmath44 , either the particle 1 does not longer change its spacetime position , or the particles 2 and 3 do not longer change their spacetime positions .",
    "the effect is the same as if the particle 1 or the particles 2 and 3 do not exist for times @xmath48 .",
    "in essence , this is how relativistic bohmian interpretation describes the particle destruction . in order for this mechanism to work",
    ", we see that it is essential that each particle possesses not only its own space coordinate @xmath49 , but also its own time coordinate @xmath50 .",
    "the corresponding particle trajectories are illustrated by fig .",
    "the picture on the left shows the trajectories of particles 1 and 2 in spacetime , for the case in which the particle 1 is destructed at time @xmath44 .",
    "the trajectory of the destructed particle looks discontinuous .",
    "however , the trajectories of all particles are described by continuous functions @xmath51 with a common parameter @xmath41 , so the set of all 3 trajectories ( because @xmath19 ) in the 4-dimensional spacetime can be viewed as a single continuous trajectory in the @xmath52 dimensional configuration space .",
    "the picture on the right of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] demonstrates the continuity on the @xmath53-@xmath54 plane of the configuration space .",
    "one may object that the mechanism above works only in a very special case in which the absence of the overlap between @xmath31 and @xmath32 is _ exact_. in a more realistic situation this overlap is negligibly small , but not exactly zero .",
    "in such a situation neither of the particles will have exactly zero 4-velocity . consequently",
    ", neither of the particles will be really destroyed .",
    "nevertheless , the measuring apparatus will still behave as if some particles have been destroyed .",
    "for example , if @xmath30 takes value @xmath33 for which @xmath55 , then for all practical purposes the measuring apparatus behaves as if the wave function collapsed to the second term in ( [ e2.5 ] ) .",
    "the particles with positions @xmath56 and @xmath57 also behave in that way . therefore , even though the particle with the position @xmath58 is not really destroyed , an effective wave - function collapse still takes place .",
    "the influence of the particle with the position @xmath58 on the measuring apparatus described by @xmath33 is negligible , which is effectively the same as if this particle has been destroyed .",
    "a `` real '' particle ( having non - zero 4-velocity ) surrounded by a sea of `` vacuum '' particles ( having zero 4-velocities).,width=226 ]    of course , the interaction with the measuring apparatus is not the only mechanism that may induce destruction of particles .",
    "any interaction with the environment may do that .",
    "( that is why we use the letter @xmath59 to denote the states of the measuring apparatus . ) or more generally , any interactions among particles may induce not only particle destruction , but also particle creation .",
    "whenever the wave function @xmath60 does not really vary ( or when this variation is negligible ) with some of @xmath16 for some range of values of @xmath16 , then at the edge of this range a trajectory of the particle @xmath61 may exhibit true ( or apparent ) creation or destruction .    in general , a qft state may be a superposition of @xmath0-particle states with @xmath0 ranging from @xmath62 to @xmath63 .",
    "thus , @xmath60 should be viewed as a function that lives in the space of infinitely many coordinates @xmath16 , @xmath64 .",
    "in particular , the 1-particle wave function @xmath14 should be viewed as a function @xmath65 with the property @xmath66 for @xmath67 .",
    "it means that any wave function in qft describes an infinite number of particles , even if most of them have zero 4-velocity .",
    "as we have already explained , particles with zero 4-velocity are dots in spacetime .",
    "the initial spacetime position of any particle may take any value , with the probability proportional to @xmath68 .",
    "thus , the bohmian particle trajectories associated with the 1-particle wave function @xmath65 take a form as in fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "in addition to one continuous particle trajectory , there is also an infinite number of `` vacuum '' particles which live for an infinitesimally short time .",
    "it is intuitively clear that a particle that lives for an infinitesimally short time is not observable .",
    "however , we have an infinite number of such particles , so could their overall effect be comparable , or even overwhelming , with respect to a finite number of `` real '' particles that live for a finite time ? there is a simple intuitive argument that such an effect should not be expected .",
    "the number of `` vacuum '' particles is equal to the cardinal number of the set on natural numbers , denoted by @xmath69 .",
    "this set has a measure zero with respect to a continuous trajectory , because a continuous trajectory corresponds to a set of real numbers , the cardinal number of which is @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "intuitively , the number of points on a single continuous trajectory is infinitely times larger than the number of points describing the `` vacuum '' particles .",
    "consequently , the contribution of the `` vacuum '' particles to any measurable effect is expected to be negligible .",
    "the purpose of the rest of the paper is to further elaborate the ideas presented in this section and to put them into a more precise framework .",
    "let @xmath71 be some orthonormal basis of 1-particle states .",
    "a general normalized 1-particle state is @xmath72 where the normalization condition implies @xmath73 . from the basis @xmath71",
    "one can construct the @xmath0-particle basis @xmath74 , where @xmath75 denotes the symmetrization over all @xmath76 for bosons , or antisymmetrization for fermions .",
    "the most general state in qft describing these particles can be written as @xmath77 .",
    "now let as assume that the number of particles is measured .",
    "it implies that the particles become entangled with the environment , such that the total state describing both the measured particles and the environment takes the form @xmath78 the environment states @xmath79 , @xmath80 are macroscopically distinct .",
    "they describe what the observers really observe .",
    "when an observer observes that the environment is in the state @xmath79 or @xmath80 , then one says that the original measured qft state is in the state @xmath81 or @xmath82 , respectively . in particular ,",
    "this is how the number of particles is measured in a state ( [ e3.3 ] ) with an uncertain number of particles .",
    "the probability that the environment will be found in the state @xmath79 or @xmath80 is equal to @xmath83 or @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "of course , ( [ e3.3 ] ) is not the only way the state @xmath85 can be expanded . in general",
    ", it can be expanded as @xmath86 where @xmath87 are some normalized ( not necessarily orthogonal ) states that do not need to have a definite number of particles .",
    "a particularly important example are coherent states ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which minimize the products of uncertainties of fields and their canonical momenta .",
    "each coherent state is a superposition of states with all possible numbers of particles , including zero .",
    "the coherent states are overcomplete and not orthogonal . yet",
    ", the expansion ( [ e3.5 ] ) may be an expansion in terms of coherent states @xmath87 as well .",
    "furthermore , the entanglement with the environment does not necessarily need to take the form ( [ e3.4 ] ) .",
    "instead , it may take a more general form @xmath88 where @xmath89 are macroscopically distinct . in principle , the interaction with the environment may create the entanglement ( [ e3.6 ] ) with respect to any set of states @xmath90 . in practice , however , some types of expansions are preferred .",
    "this fact can be explained by the theory of decoherence @xcite , which explains why states of the form of ( [ e3.6 ] ) are stable only for some particular sets @xmath90 .",
    "in fact , depending on details of the interactions with the environment , in most real situations the entanglement takes either the form ( [ e3.4 ] ) or the form ( [ e3.6 ] ) with coherent states @xmath87 .",
    "since coherent states minimize the uncertainties of fields and their canonical momenta , they behave very much like classical fields .",
    "this explains why experiments in quantum optics can often be better described in terms of fields rather than particles ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the theory of decoherence can explain under what conditions the coherent - state basis becomes preferred over basis with definite numbers of particles @xcite .",
    "there is one additional physically interesting class of sets @xmath90 .",
    "they may be eigenstates of the particle number operator defined with respect to _ bogoliubov transformed _",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite ) creation and destruction operators .",
    "thus , even the vacuum may have a nontrivial expansion of the form latexmath:[\\[\\label{u3.3 }   |0\\rangle = c_0 |0'\\rangle + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } \\sum_{i'_1,\\ldots , i'_n } c_{n;i'_1,\\ldots , i'_n }     @xmath0-particle states with respect to the bogoliubov transformed number operator .",
    "in fact , whenever the two definitions of particles are related by a bogoliubov transformation , the vacuum for one definition of particles is a squeezed state when expressed in terms of particles of the other definition of particles @xcite .",
    "thus , if the entanglement with the environment takes the form @xmath92 then the vacuum ( [ u3.3 ] ) may appear as a state with many particles .",
    "indeed , this is expected to occur when the particle detector is accelerated or when a gravitational field is present @xcite .",
    "the theory of decoherence can explain why the interaction with the environment leads to an entanglement of the form of ( [ u3.4 ] ) @xcite .",
    "thus , decoherence induced by interaction with the environment can explain why do we observe either a definite number of particles or coherent states that behave very much like classical fields .",
    "however , decoherence alone can not explain why do we observe some particular state of definite number of particles and not some other , or why do we observe some particular coherent state and not some other .",
    "consider a free scalar hermitian field operator @xmath93 satisfying the klein - gordon equation @xmath94 the field can be decomposed as @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 can be expanded as @xmath98 } , & \\nonumber \\\\ & \\hat{\\psi}^{\\dagger}(x)=\\displaystyle\\int d^3k \\ , f({\\bf k } ) \\",

    "the function @xmath104 is a real positive function which we do not specify explicitly because several different choices appear in the literature , corresponding to several different choices of normalization .",
    "all subsequent equations will be written in forms that do not depend on this choice .",
    "we define the operator @xmath105 the symbol @xmath106 denotes the symmetrization , reminding us that the expression is symmetric under the exchange of coordinates @xmath107 .",
    "( note , however , that the product of operators on the right hand side of ( [ e3.10 ] ) is in fact automatically symmetric because the operators @xmath108 commute , i.e. , @xmath109=0 $ ] . )",
    "the parameter @xmath110 is a normalization constant determined by the normalization condition that will be specified below .",
    "the operator ( [ e3.10 ] ) allows us to define @xmath0-particle states in the basis of particle spacetime positions , as latexmath:[\\[\\label{e3.11 }   |x_{n,1 } , \\ldots , x_{n , n}\\rangle = \\hat{\\psi}^{\\dagger}_n(x_{n,1 } , \\ldots , x_{n , n } )    vacuum @xmath81 , form a complete and orthogonal basis in the hilbert space of physical states .    if @xmath112 is an arbitrary ( but normalized ) @xmath0-particle state , then this state can be represented by the @xmath0-particle wave function @xmath113 we also have @xmath114 we choose the normalization constant @xmath110 in ( [ e3.10 ] ) such that the following normalization condition is satisfied @xmath115 however , this implies that the wave functions @xmath116 and @xmath117 , with different values of @xmath0 and @xmath118 , are normalized in different spaces . on the other hand , we want these wave functions to live in the same space , such that we can form superpositions of wave functions describing different numbers of particles . to accomplish this , we define @xmath119 where @xmath120 @xmath121 are volumes of the corresponding configuration spaces . in particular , the wave function of the vacuum is @xmath122 this provides that all wave functions are normalized in the same configuration space as @xmath123 where we use the notation @xmath124",

    "it also does not contain states that do not satisfy ( [ e3.9 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the notation can be further simplified by introducing an extended kinematic hilbert space that contains such unphysical states as well .",

    "the states in the heisenberg picture @xmath85 and @xmath81 are identified with the states in the interaction picture at the initial time @xmath188 and @xmath189 , respectively .    to demonstrate that such a procedure leads to a physically sensible result ,",

    ", it may seem to be in contradiction with the well - known fact that @xmath225 transforms as a time - component of a lorentz vector .",

    "physically , it means that these particles can not be detected in the far past ( the probability is zero ) , but that they can be detected in the far future . this is nothing but a probabilistic description of the creation of @xmath0 particles that have not existed in the far past .",
    "indeed , the results obtained in sec",
    ".  [ sec3.3 ] ( see , in particular , ( [ e3.57 ] ) ) show that such probabilities are consistent with the probabilities of particle creation obtained by the standard @xmath196-matrix methods in qft .",
    "having developed the probabilistic interpretation , we can also calculate the average values of various quantities .",
    "we are particularly interested in average values of the 4-momentum @xmath257 . in general , its average value is @xmath258 where @xmath259 is given by ( [ e3.40 ] ) . if @xmath239 , then ( [ e4.6 ] ) can be reduced to @xmath260 similarly , if the times of detections are known and are all equal to @xmath3 , then the average space - components of momenta are given by a more familiar expression @xmath261    finally , note that ( [ e4.6 ] ) can also be written in an alternative form @xmath262 where @xmath263 is the probability density and @xmath264 here @xmath265 is given by an obvious generalization of ( [ e3.32 ] ) @xmath266 the expression ( [ e4.9 ] ) will play an important role in the next subsection .",
    "the idea of the particle - trajectory interpretation is that each particle has some trajectory @xmath51 , where @xmath41 is an auxiliary scalar parameter that parameterizes the trajectories .",
    "such trajectories must be consistent with the probabilistic interpretation ( [ e4.1 ] ) .",

    "the physical 3-velocity @xmath273 , @xmath274 , is not affected by such a rescaling .",

    "we note two important properties of ( [ e4.19 ] ) .",
    "first , if @xmath287 in ( [ e4.18 ] ) , then @xmath276 . in particular",
    ", since @xmath287 for free fields in states with a definite number of particles ( it can be derived for any type of particles analogously to the derivation of ( [ e3.34 ] ) for spinless uncharged particles ) , it follows that @xmath276 for such states .",
    "second , if @xmath281 does not depend on some coordinate @xmath288 , then both @xmath289 and @xmath290 .",
    "[ to show that @xmath290 , note first that @xmath280 defined by ( [ e4.18 ] ) does not depend on @xmath288 when @xmath281 does not depend on @xmath288 . then the integration over @xmath291 in ( [ e4.21 ] ) produces @xmath292 , which kills the dependence on @xmath288 carried by ( [ e4.22 ] ) ] .",
    "this implies that dead particles have zero 4-velocity .",
    "the results above show that the relativistic bohmian trajectories are compatible with the spacetime probabilistic interpretation ( [ e4.1 ] ) .",
    "but what about the more conventional space probabilistic interpretations ( [ e4.3 ] ) and ( [ e4.5 ] ) ? _ a priori _ , these bohmian trajectories are not compatible with ( [ e4.3 ] ) and ( [ e4.5 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , as discussed in more detail in appendix [ appb ] for the 1-particle case , the compatibility between measurable predictions of the bohmian interpretation and that of the `` standard '' purely probabilistic interpretation restores when the appropriate theory of quantum measurements is also taken into account .",
    "having established the general theory of particle trajectories by the results above , now we can discuss particular consequences .",
    "the trajectories are determined uniquely if the initial spacetime positions @xmath293 in ( [ e4.13 ] ) , for all @xmath18 , @xmath294 , are specified .",
    "in particular , since dead particles have zero 4-velocity , such particles do not really have trajectories in spacetime .",
    "instead , they are represented by dots in spacetime , as in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( sec .  [ sec2 ] ) .",
    "the spacetime positions of these dots are specified by their initial spacetime positions .    since @xmath295 describes probabilities for particle creation and destruction , and since ( [ e4.14 ] ) provides that particle trajectories are such that spacetime positions of particles are distributed according to @xmath295 , it implies that particle trajectories are also consistent with particle creation and destruction . in particular , the trajectories in spacetime may have beginning and ending points , which correspond to points at which their 4-velocities vanish ( for an example , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "for example , the 4-velocity of the particle a vanishes if the conditional wave function @xmath296 does not depend on @xmath16 ( where @xmath297 denotes the actual spacetime positions of all particles except the particle @xmath61 ) .",
    "one very efficient mechanism of destroying particles is through the interaction with the environment , such that the total quantum state takes the form ( [ e3.4 ] ) .",
    "the environment wave functions @xmath298 , @xmath299 do not overlap , so the particles describing the environment can be in the support of only one of these environment wave functions . consequently , the conditional wave function is described by only one of the terms in the sum ( [ e3.4 ] ) , which effectively collapses the wave function to only one of the terms in ( [ e3.3 ] ) .",
    "for example , if the latter wave function is @xmath300 , then it depends on only @xmath0 coordinates among all @xmath16 .",
    "all other live particles from sectors with @xmath301 become dead , i.e. , their 4-velocities become zero which appears as their destruction in spacetime .",
    "more generally , if the overlap between the environment wave functions is negligible but not exactly zero , then particles from sectors with @xmath301 will not become dead , but their influence on the environment will still be negligible , which still provides an effective collapse to @xmath300 . since decoherence is practically irreversible ( due to many degrees of freedom involved ) , such an effective collapse is irreversible as well .",
    "another physically interesting situation is when the entanglement with the environment takes the form ( [ e3.6 ] ) , where @xmath87 are coherent states . in this case",
    ", the behavior of the environment can very well be described in terms of an environment that responds to a presence of classical fields .",
    "this explains how classical fields may appear at the macroscopic level , even when the microscopic ontology is described in terms of particles .",
    "since @xmath87 is a superposition of states with all possible numbers of particles , trajectories of particles from sectors with different numbers of particles coexist ; there is an infinite number of live particle trajectories in that case .",
    "similarly , an entanglement of the form of ( [ u3.4 ] ) explains how accelerated detectors and detectors in a gravitational field may detect particles in the vacuum . for example , let us consider the case of a uniformly accelerated detector . in this case , @xmath302 corresponds to the rindler vacuum , while @xmath81 is referred to as the minkowski vacuum @xcite .",
    "the particle trajectories described by ( [ e4.13 ] ) are those of the minkowski particles .",
    "the interaction between the minkowski vacuum and the accelerated detector creates new minkowski particles .",
    "for instance , if the detector is found in the state @xmath79 , then the minkowski particles are in the state @xmath302 , which is a squeezed state describing an infinite number of live particle trajectories .",
    "such a view seems particularly appealing from the point of view of recently discovered renormalizable horava - lifshitz gravity @xcite that contains an absolute time and thus a preferred definition of particles in a classical gravitational background @xcite .",
    "let us also give a few remarks on measurements of 4-momenta and 4-velocities .",
    "if @xmath303 in ( [ e3.1 ] ) denote the 4-momentum eigenstates , then ( [ e3.4 ] ) describes a measurement of the particle 4-momenta .",
    "since the 4-momentum eigenstates are also the 4-velocity eigenstates , ( [ e3.4 ] ) also describes a measurement of the particle 4-velocities .",
    "thus , as discussed also in more detail in @xcite , even though the bohmian particle velocities may exceed the velocity of light , they can not exceed the velocity of light when their velocities are measured .",
    "instead , the effective wave function associated with such a measurement is a momentum eigenstate of the form of ( [ e3.35 ] ) , where @xmath304 for live particles and @xmath246 for dead particles .",
    "this also explains why dead particles are not seen in experiments : their 3-momenta and energies are equal to zero .",
    "finally , we want to end this subsection with some conceptual remarks concerning the physical meaning of the parameter @xmath41 .",
    "this parameter can be thought of as an evolution parameter , playing a role similar to that of the absolute newton time @xmath3 in the usual formulation of nonrelativistic bohmian interpretation @xcite . to make the similarity with such a usual formulation more explicit",
    ", it may be useful to think of @xmath41 as a coordinate parameterizing a `` fifth dimension '' that exists independently of other 4 dimensions with coordinates @xmath305 .",
    "however , such a 5-dimensional view should not be taken too literally .",
    "in particular , while the time @xmath3 is measurable , the parameter @xmath41 is not measurable .",
    "given the fact that @xmath41 is not measurable , what is the physical meaning of the claim that particles have the distribution @xmath306 at some @xmath41 ?",
    "we can think of it in the following way : we allways measure spacetime positions of particles at some values of @xmath41 , but we do not know what these values are .",
    "consequently , the probability density that describes our knowledge is described by @xmath306 averaged over all possible values of @xmath41 . however , since @xmath306 does not depend on @xmath41 , the result of such an averaging procedure is trivial , giving @xmath306 itself .",
    "in this paper we have extended the bohmian interpretation of qm , such that it also incorporates a description of particle creation and destruction described by qft . unlike the previous attempts @xcite and @xcite to describe the creation and destruction of pointlike particles within the bohmian interpretation , the approach of the present paper incorporates the creation and destruction of pointlike particles _ automatically _ , without adding any additional structure not already present in the equations that describe the continuous particle trajectories .",
    "one reason why it works is the fact that we work with a many - time wave function , so that the 4-velocity of each particle may vanish separately . even though the many - time wave function plays a central role , we emphasize that the many - time wave function , first introduced in @xcite , is a natural concept when one wants to treat time on an equal footing with space , even if one does not have an ambition to describe particle creation and destruction @xcite .",
    "another , even more important reason why it works is the entanglement with the environment , which explains an effective wave function collapse into particle - number eigenstates ( or some other eigenstates ) even when particles are not really created or destroyed .    as a byproduct , in this paper",
    "we have also obtained many technical results that allow to represent qft states with uncertain number of particles in terms of many - time wave functions .",
    "these results may be useful by they own , even without the bohmian interpretation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this work was supported by the ministry of science of the republic of croatia under contract no .",
    "098 - 0982930 - 2864 .",
    "at each point of spacetime , one can introduce the tetrad @xmath307 , which is a collection of four spacetime vectors , @xmath308 .",
    "the bar on @xmath309 denotes that @xmath309 is not a spacetime - vector index , but only a label .",
    "by contrast , the index @xmath310 is a spacetime - vector index .",
    "the tetrad is chosen so that @xmath311 where @xmath312 is the spacetime metric and @xmath313 are components of a matrix equal to the minkowski metric .",
    "the spacetime - vector indices are raised and lowered by @xmath312 and @xmath314 , respectively , while @xmath309-labels are raised and lowered by @xmath315 and @xmath313 , respectively .",
    "thus , ( [ a1 ] ) can also be inverted as @xmath316    now let @xmath317 be the standard dirac matrices @xcite . from them",
    "we define @xmath318 the spinor indices carried by matrices @xmath317 and @xmath319 are interpreted as indices of the spinor representation of the _ internal _ group so(1,3 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath317 transform as scalars under spacetime coordinate transformations .",
    "similarly , the spinors @xmath320 are also scalars with respect to spacetime coordinate transformations , while their spinor indices are indices in the internal group so(1,3 ) .",
    "likewise , @xmath321 is also a scalar with respect to spacetime coordinate transformations .",
    "it is also convenient to define the quantity @xmath322 which is also a scalar with respect to spacetime coordinate transformations .",
    "thus we see that the quantities @xmath323 are both scalars with respect to spacetime coordinate transformations , and that the quantities @xmath324 are both vectors with respect to spacetime coordinate transformations .",
    "finally , we note that the relation with the more familiar ( but less general ) formalism in minkowski spacetime @xcite can be established by using the fact that in flat spacetime there is a global choice of coordinates in which @xmath325 however , ( [ a7 ] ) is not a covariant expression , but is only valid in one special system of coordinates .",
    "in this appendix we present a more carefull discussion of the meaning of our probabilistic interpretation that treats time on an equal footing with space . the first subsection deals with the pure probabilistic interpretation that does not assume the existence of particle trajectories , while the second subsection deals with the bohmian interpretation in which the existence of particle trajectories is also taken into account .",
    "for simplicity , we study the case of 1 particle only , while the generalization to many particles is straightforward .      in a pure probabilistic interpretation of qm",
    ", one does not assume the existence of particle trajectories .",
    "instead , the main axiom is that @xmath320 determines the spacetime probability density @xmath326 this probability describes a statistical ensemble consisting of a large number of events , where each event is an appearance of the particle at the spacetime point @xmath327 .",
    "now , if we pick up a subensemble consisting of all events @xmath327 that have the same time coordinate @xmath328 , then the distribution in this subensemble is given by the conditional probability @xmath329 where the normalization factor @xmath330 is equal to the marginal probability that the particle from the initial ensemble will have @xmath328 .",
    "( in fact , when @xmath320 is a superposition of plane waves with positive frequencies only , then @xmath331 does not depend on @xmath3 @xcite . )    a more formal way to understand ( [ appb1 ] ) is as follows .",

    "yet another way to understand ( [ appb1 ] ) and ( [ appb2 ] ) is through the theory of _ ideal _ quantum measurements . the measured particle with the position @xmath327 entangles with the measuring apparatus described by a pointer position @xmath30 .",
    "thus , instead of ( [ appb5 ] ) we have the total wave function @xmath338 where @xmath339 are normalized apparatus states that do not overlap in the @xmath30-space . the main axiom ( [ appb1 ] ) now includes @xmath30 as well , so that ( [ appb1 ] ) generalizes to @xmath340 .",
    "therefore , the probability that @xmath30 will have a value from the support of @xmath339 is equal to @xmath337 , which again leads to ( [ appb1 ] ) .",
    "( [ appb2 ] ) emerges from ( [ appb1 ] ) as a conditional probability within the statistical ensemble of measurement outcomes .",
    "of course , a real experiment is not ideal .",

    "in particular , in a real experiment the functions @xmath334 ( which are localized in both space and time ) in ( [ appb6 ] ) may be replaced by functions @xmath341 which are well localized in space , but very extended in time . in such an experiment , ( [ appb6 ] ) is replaced by an entanglement of the form @xmath342 for definiteness , @xmath341 may be taken to be time independent and proportional to @xmath343 for @xmath344 $ ] , but vanishing for other values of @xmath3 . now",
    "the measuring apparatus measures the space position @xmath2 of the particle very well , but time @xmath3 at which the particle attains this position remains uncertain with uncertainty equal to @xmath345 . instead of ( [ appb2 ] ) , the measured distribution of particle positions is now @xmath346 where @xmath347 and @xmath348 is the normalization factor chosen such that @xmath349 .",
    "namely , the probability that @xmath30 will have a value from the support of @xmath350 is given by ( [ appb2 ] ) .",
    "we also stress that the difference between ( [ appb2 ] ) and ( [ appb2 ] ) is irrelevant in most practical situations .",
    "namely , in actual experiments one usually deals with wave functions that are well approximated by energy eigenstates with a trivial time dependence proportional to @xmath351 .",
    "consequently , @xmath352 is almost independent on @xmath3 , which makes ( [ appb2 ] ) and ( [ appb2 ] ) practically indistinguishable .",
    "now let us assume that particles have trajectories @xmath353 where @xmath354 is such that @xmath355 are such trajectories compatible with the probabilistic predictions studied in sec .",
    "[ secappb1 ] ?",
    "clearly , they are compatible with ( [ appb1 ] ) because @xmath356 but are they compatible with ( [ appb2 ] ) ? to answer this question , it is useful to eliminate @xmath41 from ( [ appb7 ] ) by introducing velocities @xmath357 in general , ( [ appb7 ] ) implies that @xmath358 inequality ( [ appb10 ] ) shows that , _ a priori _ , ( [ appb7 ] ) is not compatible with ( [ appb2 ] ) ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the compatibility restores when the theory of quantum measurements is also taken into account .",
    "namely , we extend ( [ appb7 ] ) and ( [ appb7 ] ) such that @xmath359 also satisfies a bohmian equation of motion compatible with @xmath340",
    ". for ideal quantum measurements , ( [ appb6 ] ) implies that the probability that @xmath33 will take a value from the support of @xmath339 is equal to @xmath337 .",
    "this means that the statistics of measurement outcomes is given by ( [ appb1 ] ) .",
    "thus , ( [ appb2 ] ) emerges from ( [ appb1 ] ) as a conditional probability within the statistical ensemble of measurement outcomes .",
    "similarly , in a more realistic measurement based on ( [ appb6 ] ) , the probability that @xmath33 will take a value from the support of @xmath350 is given by ( [ appb2 ] ) .",
    "thus we see that the space probability density ( [ appb2 ] ) does not necessarily need to be correct . instead",
    ", the space probability density depends on how exactly it is measured .",
    "however , the important points are ( i ) that the space probability density can in principle be predicted from the fundamental axiom ( [ appb1 ] ) when the measuring procedure is well defined , and ( ii ) that the probabilistic predictions of the bohmian interpretation agree with those of the `` standard '' ( pure probabilistic ) interpretation for ideal measurements based on ( [ appb6 ] ) , as well as for more realistic measurements based on ( [ appb6 ] ) .",
