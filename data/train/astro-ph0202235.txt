    "the sdss uses a ccd camera ( gunn et  al .",

    "1996 ; stoughton et  al .",
    "2002 ) ; the images of all three of these quasars have extremely red colors in the sdss system .",
    "all three quasars are luminous and , by the eddington argument ( see  1.2 of frank , king , & raine 1992 ; fan et  al .",
    "2001 ) , have central black holes with masses of several times @xmath12  @xmath13 that formed within a billion years of the big bang .",

    "thus far we have mostly been making short , exploratory observations designed to define the basic x - ray properties of these quasars and to identify good candidates for future x - ray spectroscopy . aside from addressing the scientific issues mentioned above , this project is also laying groundwork for future x - ray observatories focused on studying the high - redshift x - ray universe ( e.g. , , , and ) .",
    "after the discoveries of , , and , we requested director s discretionary time in 2001 august for exploratory  observations of these quasars .",
    "this request was approved , and the observations were performed in 2002 january . here",

    "the basic properties of the observed quasars , along with the observation dates and exposure times , are given in table  1 .",

    "the other quasars lack radio detections and could be either radio quiet or radio intermediate ( see table  1 for their @xmath23 parameters ) .",

    ", in preparation )",
    ". given previous x - ray studies of quasars and the superb source detection capability of , these quasars were expected to be detectable with relatively short 68  ks  observations .",
    "faint mode was used for the event telemetry format , and  grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 6 were used in all analysis ; this grade set choice is a standard one that , in general , optimizes signal - to - noise ratio . we have searched for background flares that occurred during the observations and found none .",
    "we have inspected the photon arrival times for the x - ray sources described below , and there is no evidence for transient spurious phenomena affecting the data .",
    "we created images around the quasar positions in each of the four standard bands defined in table  2 , and we show adaptively smoothed full - band images for each of the quasars in figure  1 .",
    "note that in the rest frame we are probing the @xmath24  260  kev emission from these quasars .",
    "source detection was performed with wavdetect ( freeman et  al . 2002 ) . for each image , we calculated wavelet transforms ( using a mexican hat kernel ) with wavelet scale sizes from 14 pixels .",
    "those peaks whose probability of being false were less than the threshold of @xmath25 were taken as real .",
    "all of the quasars were detected in at least two of the standard bands ( see table  2 ) .",
    "the photometry in table  2 was performed using circular apertures with radii of @xmath26 ; errors on the photometry due to background subtraction are negligible . in all cases ,",
    "the full - band x - ray centroid positions lie within @xmath27 of the precise optical positions of the quasars ; this is within plausible errors considering the limited number of counts . given the positional coincidence , the probability of an unrelated , confusing counterpart for even our x - ray faintest quasar ( ) is only @xmath28 .",
    "since our observations do not have sufficient counts for spectral fitting , we have calculated the quasars fluxes and luminosities adopting a nominal power - law model with a photon index of @xmath29 ( at energy @xmath30 the photon density @xmath31 ; e.g. , reeves & turner 2000 ) and the galactic absorption column densities in table  1 .",
    "this spectral model is consistent with the observed hardness ratios of our targets , although the constraints on the hardness ratios are poor due to the limited numbers of counts . using the  x - ray center portable interactive multi - mission simulator ( pimms ; mukai 2001 ) , we find the absorption - corrected 0.52.0  kev fluxes given in table  2 . in table  2",
    "we also present the derived luminosities in the 3.514.0  kev rest - frame band ; this rest - frame band is well matched to the observed 0.52.0  kev band for our objects .",
    "note that for a @xmath29 power law the rest - frame 3.514.0  kev and 0.52.0  kev luminosities are the same .",
    "we have calculated , the slope of a nominal power law between 2500    and 2  kev in the rest frame [ @xmath32 ) where @xmath33 is the flux density at 2  kev and @xmath34 is the flux density at 2500   ] , for each of our targets ( see table  2 ) .",
    "we again adopt @xmath29 for the x - ray continuum , and we use an optical power - law slope of @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ; e.g. , schneider et  al .",
    "2001 ; vanden  berk et  al .",
    "2001 ) to estimate the flux density at 2500    in the rest frame .",
    "we have used the observed soft - band fluxes to find @xmath33 in the  calculations , so the derived  values are actually based on the relative amount of x - ray emission in the @xmath24  3.514.0  kev rest - frame band ; 2  kev in the rest frame corresponds to @xmath37  kev in the observed frame for these quasars , and this energy is poorly sampled by acis for these faint sources .",
    "these three short  observations provide the highest redshift x - ray detections to date , demonstrating the power of  for probing the high - redshift x - ray universe efficiently .",
    "figure  2 shows a redshift histogram of the known quasars ; the x - ray detections are indicated in the figure.george/z4.qsos and http://www.astro.psu.edu/users/niel/papers/highz-xray-detected.dat . ]",
    "together with , the highest redshift x - ray detection obtained previously , the quasars studied here form a small but complete @xmath19 color - selected sample that should be representative of the luminous , optically selected quasar population at @xmath3 ( we recognize that optically selected @xmath3 quasars may not be representative of the entire @xmath3 quasar population , but these quasars are the only ones available for study at present ) .    in figure  3",
    "we plot the galactic absorption - corrected 0.52.0  kev flux versus @xmath38 magnitude for the quasars in table  1 as well as for other @xmath39 quasars ( e.g. , kaspi et  al .",
    "2000 ; vignali et  al . 2001 ; silverman et  al .",
    "while the bal quasar  is notably x - ray weak ( probably due to intrinsic x - ray absorption ; see brandt et  al . 2001 ) , the @xmath3 quasars observed by  appear to lie within the locus of points for other @xmath39 quasars .",
    "the spectral region around the c  iv line at rest - frame 1549    has been observed in both  and ; neither shows evidence for bals ( fan et  al .",
    "2001 ; pentericci et  al .",
    "the integrated column density of the intergalactic medium to these quasars , including both ionized and neutral material , is almost certainly too small to produce significant x - ray absorption ( e.g. , weinberg et  al .",
    "1997 ; miralda - escud 2000 ) .",
    "this is especially true given the intergalactic medium s low metallicity .",
    "figure  4 shows that there is no strong evolution in  for optically selected , radio - quiet quasars ( rqqs ) out to @xmath3 ( despite the strong changes in quasar number density over the redshift range shown in this figure ; see  5.3 of fan et  al .",
    "2001 and references therein ) .",
    "the central x - ray power sources of quasars do not appear to evolve strongly out to this redshift , and there is no indication that strong intrinsic obscuration of the x - ray emission generally occurs at @xmath3 .",
    "this result bodes well for attempts to detect the first massive black holes to form in the universe ( @xmath40  820 ) with deep x - ray surveys ; our data suggest that these objects are likely to be luminous x - ray emitters .",
    "furthermore , this result helps to validate the bolometric correction factor adopted by fan et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) when estimating the black hole masses of these objects via the eddington argument .",
    "some studies have found evidence that  depends upon quasar luminosity , with more luminous quasars generally having larger negative values of  ( e.g. , green et  al .",
    "1995 and references therein ) .",
    "the @xmath3 quasars under study here have comparable luminosities at 2500    to those of the typical @xmath40  45 quasars studied by vignali et  al .",
    "( 2001 ; see their figure  5 noting the different cosmology ) .",
    "therefore , we do not expect luminosity effects upon  to affect our conclusions materially ( see  4.2 of vignali et  al .",
    "2001 for further discussion ) .",
    "the observations presented here are consistent with the statement that the majority of optically selected quasars at redshifts of near six possess similar x - ray properties to those of their low - redshift counterparts .",
    "x - ray observations have now reached what appears to be the redshift regime of the reionization of the intergalactic medium ( becker et  al .",
    "2001 ; djorgovski et  al . 2001 ) .",
