    "in nature , organisms whose sizes differ by many orders of magnitude have been observed to switch between different modes of movement .",
    "for instance , the bacterium _ escherichia coli _ changes the orientation of one or more of its flagella between clockwise and anticlockwise to achieve a _ run - and - tumble _ like motion @xcite . as a result , during the runs , we see migration - like movement and during the tumbles , we see resting or local diffusion behaviour . to add to this complexity , it should be noted that the direction of successive runs are correlated . on a larger scale",
    "one could consider migratory movements of vertebrates where individuals often travel large distances intermittent with stop - overs to rest or forage .",
    "an example , used in this paper , is the lesser black - backed gull ( _ larus fuscus _ ) .",
    "individuals of this species that breed in the netherlands migrate southwards during autumn .",
    "even though the scales involved in these two processes differ by many orders of magnitude , one can use a similar mathematical framework to model the observed motion .    the use of mathematical models to describe the motion of a variety of biological organisms , including bumblebees @xcite , plants @xcite and zebra @xcite has been the subject of much research interest for several decades .",
    "early approaches were predominantly centred on the position jump model of motion @xcite , where agents instantaneously change position according to a distribution kernel and are interspersed with waiting periods of stochastic length .",
    "the position jump framework suffers from the limitation that correlations in the direction of successive runs are difficult to capture , this correlation however is present in many types of movement @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the diffusive nature of the position jump framework results in an unbounded distribution of movement speeds between successive steps . a related framework that is arguably more realistic for modelling",
    "the motion of organisms is the velocity jump ( vj ) model @xcite , in which organisms travel with a randomly - distributed speed and angle for a finite duration before undergoing a stochastic reorientation event .    in most formulations of the velocity jump process",
    ", there is an assumption that events occur as a poisson process , which is manifested as a constant rate parameter in the resulting differential equation . in the position",
    "jump framework , non - exponentially distributed wait times and non - gaussian kernel processes have been formulated , although this led to fractional diffusion equations @xcite .",
    "recently , it has become clear how to extend the velocity jump framework to allow for more general distributions of interest @xcite .    in many velocity jump models",
    ", it is assumed that resting states are largely negligible @xcite , this can be attributed to a focus on organisms with only momentary resting states , this has the benefit of alleviating some mathematical complexity whilst not changing the result significantly @xcite .",
    "however , in the work by othmer @xcite and erban @xcite , it was shown that resting states can be included and are sometimes required in order to obtain adequate fits to experimental data @xcite .",
    "our goal in this paper is to extend the work by friedrich _ et .",
    "@xcite to allow for resting states - which are non - negligible - following the methodology of othmer @xcite .",
    "the mathematical complexity of friedrich s model is such that finding solutions analytically or numerically is , in general , impractical . in the original paper , simplifications",
    "were made which led to a fractional kramers - fokker - planck equation , which has a known analytic solution @xcite .",
    "however , the simplifications relevant to a physical system are seldom relevant to a biological one .",
    "for instance , the original formulation related to non - gaussian kinetics in a weakly damped system ; however , we are considering self - propelled particle models where biological agents generate their own momentum . in the absence of such obvious simplifications for our system ,",
    "we instead exploit methods to extract summary statistics from the governing equations , which may in turn be compared with experimental data .    after presenting the model of interest",
    "we derive the mean squared displacement ( msd ) .",
    "as we have high - quality data available relating to the movement of _ e. coli _ and _ l. fuscus _ , we show that the msd for the model and experimental data align .",
    "what is novel about our approach is that , provided the two discrete modes of operation constitute a good model , the parameters can be extracted on a microscopic scale prior to any numerical solution and then macroscopic behaviour can be derived _ without _ optimising or trying to fit data _",
    "a posteriori_.    since the dynamics of the experimental data and those of the generalised velocity jump model achieve a close match , we explore numerically tractable simplifications to the equations of interest .",
    "most notably , we investigate the cattaneo approximation , following the work by hillen @xcite .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the model presented does not take into account interactions between biological agents or even interactions with the environment .",
    "whilst such effects are beyond the scope of the current study , it should be possible to extend the theory to incorporate these phenomena .",
    "in particular , the velocity jump process has roots in kinetic theory and as such , similar to how atoms attract and repel one another , models have been developed for biological agents to act comparably @xcite .",
    "equally , there is similar work detailing interactions between a biological agent and its environment , both fixed environments and signalling via diffusing chemical gradients @xcite .",
    "consider a biological agent that switches stochastically between running and resting behaviour . during a running phase",
    ", the organism travels with constant velocity ; during a resting phase , it remains stationary . upon resuming a run following a rest ,",
    "a new velocity is selected randomly .",
    "this motion is governed by three primary stochastic effects .",
    "we specify these by probability density functions ( pdfs ) , as given below .",

    "we can write down coupled differential equations for these states . we define @xmath22 to be the density of particles at position @xmath23 , with velocity @xmath24 at time @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the density of those particles resting at @xmath27 , having just finished a jump of velocity @xmath9 .",

    "a full analytic or numerical solution is impractical without first making simplifications .",
    "we therefore first consider how to estimate the second spatial moment , i.e. the mean squared displacement @xcite .    for the test function @xmath42 , we consider for arbitrary density @xmath43 , @xmath44 this gives the expected value of @xmath45 over the space @xmath46 at time t , weighted by density @xmath47 . by using test functions",

    "we can then obtain a closed system of integro - differential equations for these quantities .",
    "it first requires however , that we make some assumptions on the turning kernel @xmath53 . by considering that the mean post - turn velocity has the same orientation as the previous velocity , we define the index of persistence @xmath54 via the relation @xmath55 informally",

    "in this study , we consider experimental data relating to the bacterium _",

    "there is a large collection of work relating to studying the run - and - tumble motion as exhibited in many flagellated bacteria @xcite . a case of particular interest to many is _ e. coli _ , perhaps due to the fact that its internal signalling pathways are less complex than those of other chemotactic bacteria @xcite .",
    "most available literature points to both the running and resting times being exponentially distributed @xcite .",
    "this exponential parameter can change as a response to its environment and has led to a multitude of papers showing that this mechanism leads to chemotaxis either towards nutrients or away from toxins @xcite .",

    "it is possible to extract the angle changes observed between running phases and parameters for the exponential running and waiting pdfs along with speed distributions .      in figure [ vonmises_ecoli ] , we see that from run - to - run , the distribution of angles is approximately a wrapped normal distribution . for mathematical ease ,",

    "figure2.pdf ( 3,10 ) ( 44,0)time ( s )    it should be noted that from the literature , _ e. coli _ is thought to have a bi - modal distribution around the previous direction @xcite , the validity of this is hard to confirm as previous data was hand annotated and it is hard to specify the state of the bacterium when diffusion effects are also in place . whilst we had more data available to us and used automated tracking methods , it could well be that our method heavily biases walks towards normally distributed reorientation .    through the hmm technique",
    "as outlined in @xcite , estimates for the exponential parameters were found to be @xmath74 and @xmath75 . the mean squared speed whilst running was also calculated to be @xmath76 . in figure",

    "e. coli _ along with the size of the viewing window , one can stipulate that by only considering the msd before 4 seconds , we can achieve a good estimate .",
    "note that we lose a small amount of data over time as bacterium swim out of the observation window , at later times this ruins the validity of the msd curve .",
    "in this section we consider lesser black - backed gulls that breed on texel ( the netherlands ) . during their non - breeding period ( august to april ) , these birds interchange between localised movements ( or resting ) and long distance movements ( migration ) @xcite . during the resting mode birds travel up to 50 km but",
    "return to a central place every day , whereas during the migration mode birds do not return to the central place and can travel several hundreds of kilometers per day .",
    "one point of interest is that whilst the resting periods can last months on end , the migrations may only last for a few days on end .",

    "this signal is sampled @xmath77 times a day .",
    "if the value of this signal is low , points are clustered together ( local resting behaviour ) otherwise they are spread apart ( migratory behaviour ) . at the cost of including some erroneous",
    "exceptionally short rests , we can set a low threshold value of @xmath78 ; the presence of short rests is then fixed by discarding any resting phases shorter than 2 days . in comparison ,",
    "the running periods can virtually be of any length as there have been instances of a bird flying exceptionally long distances over a week .",
    "figure4.pdf ( 5,12 ) ( 39,0)time ( days )    as we only had the data for @xmath77 birds available , we divided their sample paths up into @xmath79 day intervals after approximating distributions of interest , leading to calculation of the msd over 62 sample paths .",
    "in contrast to the _ e. coli _ dataset , we see that running and waiting times are non - exponentially distributed .",
    "the distribution of running and waiting times were approximated by inverse gaussian distributions @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the speed distribution gave an estimate for the mean squared running speed as @xmath82 and again using a von mises distribution in angle , we find @xmath83 .    in figure [ msd_gulls ]",
    ", we plot the mean squared displacement in kilometres squared against time in days .",
    "as there were fewer sample paths available , the empirical mean square displacement curve is not very smooth and as a result the agreement with the theoretical curve is less good than in the bacterial case .",
    "however as the majority of the gulls were in a resting state to begin with , we do capture the initial delay before a linear growth stage . as the gulls are frequently resting as opposed to migrating , we see the data for the gulls ( in blue ) undergoing a style of step function where a small number of gulls undergoing fast movement quickly changes the msd for the whole population . as the number of sample paths increases ,",
    "this effect will smooth out .",
    "with both examples , as time passes , we see that @xmath84 for large @xmath85 .",
    "it is well known that linear mean squared displacement corresponds to the solution of the diffusion equation , or at least diffusive - like behaviour .",
    "it would now be pertinent to see if a diffusion approximation could be found for large time .",
    "we now construct a large time effective diffusion equation . by first considering equations ( [ p_forward])([r_forward ] )",
    ", we transform into laplace space , where large values of @xmath85 correspond to small values of the laplace variable @xmath86 .",
    "we then carry out a taylor expansion of the delay kernels to remove the convolutions in time ( see equations ( [ p_laplace])([r_laplace ] ) in appendix [ appa ] for details ) .    converting back to the time domain , one obtains @xmath87 and @xmath88    there are now two further steps to obtain an effective diffusion equation .",
    "first , by considering successively greater monomial moments in the velocity space , one obtains a system of @xmath89-equations where the equation for the time evolution of moment @xmath89 corresponds to the flux of moment @xmath90 .",
    "it therefore becomes necessary to ` close ' the system of equations to create something mathematically tractable .",
    "we use the cattaneo approximation for this purpose @xcite .",
    "once a closed system of equations has been found , we then carry out an asymptotic expansion where we investigate the parabolic regime to obtain a single equation for the evolution of the density of particles at large time .",
    "note that it would be possible to carry out a similar process for smaller time behaviour by taylor expanding the spatial delays in the convolution integrals .",
    "asymptotic analysis would then have to be carried out to simplify the remaining convolution .",
    "we can multiply equations ( [ large_time_p_for])([large_time_r_for ] ) by monomials in @xmath10 and integrate over the velocity space to obtain equations for the velocity moments @xmath91 the equations relating the terms @xmath92 are given below . for initial integration over the velocity space ,",

    "this was demonstrated in section [ compexptheo ] , in which different approaches were taken to obtain the required parameters .",
    "nonetheless , such methods are the focus of much current research effort @xcite , and we therefore believe that approaches such as ours will become increasingly relevant in the future . as far as the authors are aware , there has been no unified approach to tackling this problem .",
    "finally , we demonstrated the novel result that for the underlying stochastic process of interest , the variance of the running time contributes to the large time diffusion constant .",
    "this raises the key question : when does the parabolic regime emerge ?",
    "our results also act as a warning against using the exponentially distributed running times as an approximation for other distributions , as whilst their mean values may align , the underlying dynamics can change drastically as shown with the link between figures [ comp_1 ] and [ comp_2 ] .",
    "regarding the accuracy of this generalised velocity jump framework , it should be realised that the underlying models for the examples given could be improved by making the model more specific to the agent of interest .",
    "below we discuss some possible alterations to the model - however at the cost of species generality .      for _ e. coli _ ,",
    "the bacterium is always subject to diffusion ; in theory , this should add to its mean squared displacement while resting and may also affect running phases via rotational diffusion @xcite .",
    "if one wanted to incorporate a small fix to the resting state , it would be simple to add a diffusion term in space to equation ( [ r_forward ] ) .",
    "however , for a more comprehensive solution to the problem , to retain the correlation effects with turning kernel @xmath53 , the equation ( [ p_forward ] ) would have a rotational diffusion term added , which is achieved via a laplacian in the velocity space @xcite .",
    "furthermore , equation ( [ r_forward ] ) would have to have to retain its defunct velocity field for orientation but also to include another velocity variable to allow for movement due to diffusion .",
    "a particularly interesting result would be to explore whether the gaussian - like reorientation were a resultant effect from this rotational diffusion . by testing differing viscosities of fluid for the swimming _",
    ", one could undoubtedly make headway using this approach , work already initiated by rosser _ et .",
    "_ @xcite .    for the _ l. fuscus _",
    ", there are many physical and ecological phenomena which could to be built into the model ; these range from the day - night cycles , in which the bird is reluctant to fly long distances through the night , to geographical effects , where the bird may follow the coastline for navigation .",
    "one could also consider environment factors , such as wind influence and availability of food resources . in the work by chauviere _",
    "@xcite , the authors consider the migration of cells along an extra - cellular matrix . using a similar formulation to ours , but only considering exponentially distributed waiting times , cells are modelled to preferentially guide themselves along these extra - cellular fibres .",
    "it would not be difficult to imagine modifying this work to show how gulls may align their trajectory along coastlines , or using other geographical markers .",
    "we can motivate the set of equations ( [ p_forward]-[r_forward ] ) by considering the temporary variables :    * @xmath170 the density of particles at position @xmath171 , with velocity @xmath172 at time @xmath173 , _ having just started a jump_. * @xmath174 the density of particles at position @xmath171 , _ having just finished a jump _ of velocity @xmath172 at time @xmath173 and _ just started a rest_.    this leads to densities :    * @xmath175 the density of particles at position @xmath171 , with velocity @xmath172 at time @xmath173 , being in a running state .",
    "we should note that we can relate @xmath120 to @xmath176 via the equation @xmath177 for @xmath178 being the probability that a jump lasts longer than @xmath85 , clearly @xmath179 .",
    "* @xmath180 the density of particles at position @xmath171 , having just finishing a jump of velocity @xmath172 at time @xmath173 in a resting state .",

    "@xmath195 reverting back to the temporal variable @xmath85 , we obtain equations ( [ p_forward][r_forward ] ) .",
    "the integro - differential equations for mean squared displacement , or indeed any other differential equation above , can now be easily solved by a variety of methods for numerical integration . however , in the case where one of the waiting times is exponentially distributed , @xmath38 has been shown to become a multiple of the delta - function at the origin .",
    "it can be seen that many other distributions also have a numerical impulse at the origin , numerically integrating over an impulse is often difficult if not impossible so we carry out asymptotic analysis to evaluate the magnitude of said impulse .    to investigate the small time behaviour of @xmath196",
