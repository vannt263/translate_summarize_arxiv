    "consider a maladapted population such as a bacterial colony in a glucose - limited environment , or a viral population in a vaccinated animal cell . in such harsh environments ,",
    "the less fit members of the population are likely to perish and only the highly fit ones can survive to the next generation . in this manner , the fitness of the population increases with time and the initially maladapted population evolves to a well - adapted state . in the last century",
    ", there has been a concerted effort to put this verbal theory of darwin @xcite on a solid quantitative footing by performing long - term experiments on microbial populations and studying theoretical models of biological evolution .",
    "one of the questions in evolutionary biology concerns the mode of evolution . in the experiments on microbes , it is found that the fitness of the maladapted population can increase with time in either a smooth continuous manner @xcite or sudden jumps @xcite .",
    "the latter mode is consistent with evolution on a fitness landscape defined on genotypic space with many local peaks separated by fitness valleys .",
    "on such a rugged fitness landscape , a low fitness population initially climbs a fitness peak until it encounters a local peak where it gets trapped since a better peak lies some mutational distance away . in a population of realistic size , it takes a finite time for an adaptive mutation to arise and the fitness stays constant during this time ( stasis ) .",
    "once some beneficial mutants become available , the fitness increases quickly as the population moves to a higher peak where it can again get stuck .",
    "such dynamics alternating between stasis and rapid changes in fitness go on until the population reaches the global maximum .",
    "this punctuated behavior of fitness is also seen in deterministic models that assume infinite population size .",
    "an example of such a step - like pattern for average fitness is shown in fig .",
    "[ avgq ] . a neat and unambiguous way of defining a step is by considering the fitness of the most populated genotype also shown in fig .  [ avgq ] .",
    "since large but finite populations evolve deterministically at short times @xcite , it is worthwhile to study the punctuated evolution in models with infinite number of individuals . in this article",
    ", we will briefly describe some exact results concerning the dynamics of an infinitely large population on rugged fitness landscapes @xcite .",
    "we will find that the mechanism producing the step - like behavior is not due to `` valley crossing '' as in finite populations but when a fitter population `` overtakes '' the less fit one as described in the subsequent sections .     and mutation probability @xmath0 .",
    "we consider an infinitely large population reproducing asexually via the elementary processes of selection and mutation .",
    "each individual in the population carries a binary string @xmath1 of length @xmath2 where @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath5 sequences are arranged on the multi - dimensional hamming space .",
    "the information about the environment is encoded in fitness landscape defined as a map from the sequence space into the real numbers and is generated by associating a non - negative real number @xmath6 to each sequence @xmath7 .",
    "fitness landscapes can be simple possessing some symmetry properties such as permutation invariance , or complex devoid of any such symmetries @xcite .",
    "fitness functions with single peak are an example of simple fitness landscapes while rugged landscapes with many hills and valleys belong to the latter class .",
    "the average population fraction @xmath8 with sequence @xmath7 at time @xmath9 follows mutation - selection dynamics described by the following discrete time equation @xcite ( , t+1)=  .",
    "[ quasi ] the last two factors in the numerator of the above equation give the population fraction when a sequence @xmath10 copies itself with replication probability @xmath11 since fitness is defined as the average number of offspring produced per generation .",
    "after the reproduction process , point mutations are introduced independently at each locus of the sequence @xmath10 with probability @xmath12 per generation .",
    "thus , a sequence @xmath7 is obtained via mutations in @xmath10 with probability p_ = ^d(, ) ( 1 - ) ^l - d(, ) [ mut ] where the hamming distance @xmath13 is the number of point mutations in which the sequences @xmath7 and @xmath10 differ .",
    "the denominator of ( [ quasi ] ) is the average fitness of the population at time @xmath9 which ensures that the density @xmath8 is conserved .",
    "the stationary state of the quasispecies equation ( [ quasi ] ) has been studied extensively in the last two decades for various fitness landscapes .",
    "these numerical and analytical studies have shown that for most landscapes , there exists a critical mutation rate @xmath14 below which the population forms a quasispecies consisting of fittest genotype and its closely related mutants while above it , the population delocalises over the whole sequence space .",
    "this _ error threshold _ phenomenon can be easily demonstrated for a single peak fitness landscape defined as w()=w_0 _ , _",
    "0+(1-_,_0 )  ,  w_0 > 1 where @xmath15 is the fittest sequence . in the limit @xmath16 keeping @xmath17 fixed , the frequency of the fittest sequence in the steady state of ( [ quasi ] ) is given by ( _ 0)= which is an acceptable solution provided @xmath18 .",
    "for @xmath19 , selection is unable to counter the delocalising effects of mutation and the population can not be maintained at the fitness peak .",
    "for a discussion of error threshold phenomenon on other fitness landscapes and generalisations of the basic quasispecies equation ( [ quasi ] ) , we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "we now turn our attention to the dynamical evolution of @xmath20 on rugged fitness landscapes .",
    "we consider maximally rugged fitness landscapes for which the fitness @xmath6 is a random variable chosen independently from a common distribution .",
    "it is useful to introduce the unnormalised population defined as ( , t)=x(,t ) _",

    "we have ( , 1 ) ~^d(,^(0 ) ) w(^(0 ) )  .",
    "one - gen thus in an infinite population model , each sequence gets populated in one generation obviating the need for `` valley crossing '' which is required for finite populations . although an exact solution of ( [ linear ] ) for @xmath24 is not available , it is possible to obtain several asymptotically exact results concerning the most populated genotype using a simplified version of the quasispecies dynamics .",
    "numerical simulations of @xcite showed that dynamical properties involving the most populated genotype are well described by a simplified model which approximates the population @xmath25 in ( [ linear ] ) by ( , t ) ~^d(,^(0 ) ) w^t ( )  ,  t > 1  .",
    "shell this model ignores mutations once each sequence has been populated and allows the population at each sequence to grow with its own fitness . however , a recent perturbative analysis in the small parameter @xmath12 shows that this approximation holds for highly fit sequences and at short times @xcite .",
    "writing @xmath26 and rescaling time by @xmath27 in ( [ shell ] ) , we find that the logarithmic population @xmath28 obeys the following linear equation : e(,t)=-d(,^(0 ) ) + f ( )  t  .",

    "[ talklines]b , the sequences at distance @xmath42 and @xmath36 from the initial sequence are records but the sequence at @xmath43 does not become a most populated genotype . in order to qualify as a _ jump _ , it is not sufficient to have a record fitness ; the population should also be able to overtake the current winner in minimum time .",
    "due to the overtaking time minimization constraint , the records and jumps have different statistical properties which we describe briefly in the next subsections .      although the record statistics for independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d .",

    "we have a situation in which @xmath44 is a maximum of @xmath45 i.i.d . random variables .",

    "k=  ,  k < l/2  .",
    "ptildeshell the meaning of the above distribution is intuitively clear : as it is easier to break records in the beginning , the probability to find a record is near unity for @xmath49 and it vanishes beyond @xmath50 because the global maximum typically occurs at this distance .",
    "the average number @xmath51 of records can be obtained by simply integrating @xmath52 over @xmath35 to yield @xmath53 .",
    "it is also possible to find the typical spacing @xmath54 between the @xmath55th and @xmath56th record where we have labeled the last record ( i.e. global maximum ) as @xmath57 .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that the typical inter - record spacing falls as a power law given by @xcite ( j ) , j 1 .",
    "interrecshell the above expression indicates that the spacing between the last few records ( i.e @xmath58 ) is of order @xmath59 , while most of the records are crowded at the beginning which is consistent with the behavior of the record occurrence probability ( [ ptildeshell ] ) .",
    "the calculation of jump statistics @xcite is more involved than that of records because a jump event requires a minimization of the overtaking time .",
    "this constraint imposes a condition on the fitnesses of the squences that can possibly overtake the current leader in a time interval between @xmath9 and @xmath60 . the sequence at distance @xmath61 can overtake the @xmath35th one ( with fitness @xmath62 ) at time @xmath9 if the fitness @xmath63 and at time @xmath60 , @xmath64 if f(k)== f+- dt+o(dt^2 )",
    ". then the total collision rate @xmath65 with which the @xmath35th sequence is overtaken by the @xmath61th one is given as w_k,k(f , t )  p_k ( f+ )  ,  k > k   coll where @xmath66 is the distribution of the maximum of @xmath47 i.i.d .",

    "using this collision rate , we can write the probability @xmath69 that the sequence at distance @xmath61 overtakes the @xmath35th one at time @xmath9 as _ k,k(t)= _ f_^f _ df  w_k,k(f , t )  p_k(f , t ) [ basic ] where the probability @xmath70 that the @xmath35th sequence has the largest population at time @xmath9 is given by p_k(f , t)=p_k(f )   _ ^l _ f_^f+ df  p_j(f )  . max note that unlike the records , the jump properties depend on the underlying distribution of the random variables . below we present some results when the distribution @xmath71 .    integrating ( [ basic ] ) over time , the probability distribution @xmath72 that @xmath35th sequence is overtaken by @xmath61th sequence is obtained , p_k,k  ( )  e^-  ,  k < k < l/2  .",
    "this form of the distribution implies that the overtaking sequence @xmath61 is located within @xmath73 distance of the overtaken sequence @xmath35 .",
    "thus the typical spacing between successive jumps for large @xmath35 is roughly constant and goes as @xmath59 unlike in the case of records discussed in the last subsection .",
    "the jump distribution @xmath74 for a jump to occur at distance @xmath35 is obtained by integrating over @xmath61 and we have @xcite p_k  _ h ( -k ) where @xmath75 is the heaviside step function which takes care of the fact that the record distribution ( [ ptildeshell ] ) vanishes at distance @xmath50 . instead of integrating over time , by summing over the space variables @xmath76 in ( [ basic ] ) , the probability @xmath77 that a jump occurs at time @xmath9 can be obtained and is given by @xcite p(t)=    ( )  .",
    "jt - shell the heavy tail distribution @xmath78 can be understood using a simple argument @xcite and implies that mean overtaking time is infinite .",
    "finally , by either summing @xmath74 over @xmath35 or integrating @xmath77 over time , the total number of jumps @xmath79 are found to be @xmath80 which is much smaller than the number of records @xmath81 .",
    "in this article , we discussed the steady state and the dynamics of the quasispecies model which describes a self - replicating population evolving under mutation - selection dynamics .",
