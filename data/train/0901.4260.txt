    "two models have been used extensively to analyze gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) and their afterglows ( ags ) : the fireball ( fb ) model and the cannonball ( cb ) model . despite their similar names ,",
    "the two models were and still are entirely different , hence only one of them , if either , may provide a faithful physical description of grbs . until recently , the fireball ( fb ) model has been widely accepted as that model .",
    "however , the rich and accurate data that have been accumulated in recent years from space- and ground - based observations have challenged this prevailing view on grbs ( for details see [ 1 ] and references therein ) : synchrotron radiation ( sr ) can not explain simultaneously their prompt optical emission and their hard x - ray and @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "the prompt hard x - ray and @xmath0-ray pulses can not be explained by sr from internal shocks generated by collisions between conical shells .",
    "neither can sr explain their typical energy , spectrum , spectral evolution , pulse - shape , rapid spectral softening during their fast decay phase and the established correlations between various observables .",
    "moreover , contrary to the predictions of the fb model , the broadband afterglows of grbs are highly chromatic at early times , the brightest grbs do not show jet breaks , and in canonical grbs where breaks are present , they are usually chromatic and do not satisfy the ` closure relations ' expected from fb model ` jet breaks ' .    in spite of the above ,",
    "the grb community is not so critical and many authors believe that the grb data require only some modifications of the standard fb model in order to accommodate the observations .",
    "other authors simply ignore the failures of the fb model and continue the interpretation of the observations with the fb model taxonomy ( ` colliding conical shells ' , ` internal and external shocks ' , ` forward and reverse shocks ' , ` continuous energy injection ' , ` refreshed shocks ' ) and parametrize the data with freely adopted formulae ( e.g. , ` segmented power laws ' , exponential - to power - law components ) which were never derived explicitly from any underlying physical assumptions ( for recent examples , see , e.g. [ 2],[3],[4 ] ) .",
    "the situation of the cb model is entirely different . in a series of publications , which were largely ignored by the rest of the grb community",
    ", it was demonstrated repeatedly that the model correctly predicted the main observed properties of grbs and reproduces successfully the diverse broad - band light - curves of both long grbs ( [ 1 ] and references therein ) and short hard bursts ( shbs ) [ 5 ] .",
    "here we highlight this success of the cb model for long grbs .",
    "in the cb model [ 6,7 ] , _ long - duration _ grbs and their ags are produced by bipolar jets of highly relativistic plasmoids of ordinary matter [ 8,9 ] ejected in core - collapse supernova ( sn ) explosions [ 10 ] .",
    "it is hypothesized that an accretion disk or a torus is produced around the newly formed compact object , either by stellar material originally close to the surface of the imploding core and left behind by the explosion - generating outgoing shock , or by more distant stellar matter falling back after its passage [ 11 ] . as observed in microquasars ,",
    "each time part of the accretion disk falls abruptly onto the compact object two jets of cannonballs ( cbs ) made of _ ordinary - matter plasma _ are emitted with large bulk - motion lorentz factors in opposite directions along the rotation axis , fromwhere matter has already fallen back onto the compact object due to lack of rotational support .",
    "the prompt @xmath0-ray and x - ray emission is dominated by inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of photons of the sn glory - light scattered and/or emitted by the pre - supernova wind blown from the progenitor star .",
    "the cbs electrons compton up - scatter the glory photons to @xmath0 and x - ray energies and collimate them into a narrow beam along the cbs directions of motion .",
    "a second mechanism besides ics that generates radiation by a cb is synchrotron radiation ( sr ) .",
    "the emitted cbs , which initially expand in their rest frame with the speed of sound in a relativistic plasma , merge within a short ( observer ) time into a few leading cbs .",
    "the beamed radiation of the cbs ionizes the wind / ejecta blown by the progenitor star and the interstellar medium ( ism ) in front of them . in the cbs rest frame , the ions continuously impinging on a cb generate within it a turbulent magnetic field , which is assumed to be in approximate energy equipartition with them . in this field",
    "the fermi accelerated cb electrons and ism intercepted electrons emit synchrotron radiation .",
    "the initial expansion of a cb produces a rapidly rising sr light - curve that begins to decline and traces the circumburst density of the pre - supernova wind / ejecta blown by the progenitor star into the roughly constant ism density .",
    "only when the cb has swept a mass comparable to its rest mass , does the continuous collision with the medium begin to decelerate it effectively .",
    "this results in a gradual steepening ( break ) of the sr light - curve into an asymptotic power - law decay .",
    "a grb is a sum of pulses beginning at different times .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the time after the beginning of such a pulse .",
    "its light - curve produced by inverse compton scattering of glory photons with a thin bremsstrahlung spectrum by the bulk of the cb s electrons which are comoving with it , is generally well approximated by [ 1 ] @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a constant that depends on the cb s baryon number , on its lorentz and doppler factors , on the density of the glory light and on the grb s redshift and distance , and @xmath4 with @xmath5 being the time when the ics contribution to @xmath6 reaches its peak value .",
    "it satisfies @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the peak energy of the time - integrated spectrum .",
    "thus , in the cb model , each ics pulse in the grb light - curve is described by four parameters , @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 and the beginning time of the pulse which is set to be 0 .",

    "in particular , it correctly describes the rapid spectral softening during the fast decline phase of the prompt emission in grbs and xrfs .",
