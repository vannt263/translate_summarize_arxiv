    "infectious diseases spread through media such as air , water , direct contact or carriers such as insects , flies , and mosquitoes @xcite .",
    "the dynamics may well be understood by modeling causes or carriers of the disease .",
    "it is not possible all the time to control the media or carriers involved in spread of the infection and sometimes it may even be beyond determination .",
    "many a time , we may not even recognize the presence of an infection until it becomes predominant .",
    "mathematical modeling is a tool that has been popularly employed in prevention and control of infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) @xcite , human immunodeficiency virus infection / acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( hiv / aids ) @xcite , h5n1 ( avian flu ) @xcite and h1n1 ( swine flu ) @xcite .",
    "also , they have been useful in studying some of the drug resistant strains of malaria @xcite , tuberculosis @xcite , methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mrsa ) @xcite and marine bacteriophage infection @xcite .",
    "simple deterministic models are based on dividing the population into compartments such as susceptible , exposed , infected and recovered .",
    "the susceptible - infective ( si ) model is useful in understanding diseases such as feline infectious peritonitis ( fip ) @xcite as the host remain infected till they die .",
    "the susceptible - infective - susceptible ( sis ) model is employed in studying infections such as gonorrhea @xcite as there is a possibility of host becoming susceptible to infection once again .",
    "the susceptible - infective - recovered ( sir ) model is employed to understand diseases such as syphilis @xcite , wherein , immunity lasts for a limited period before waning such that the individual is once again susceptible .",
    "dynamics of such systems are generally studied from two perspectives , ( i ) stability of disease - free equilibrium , and ( ii ) stability of endemic equilibrium . in the former case conditions under which pathogens",
    "suffer extinction leaving individuals as susceptible are studied , whereas in the later , conditions in which infective and susceptible populations coexist are established .",
    "interactions among populations in compartments such as the susceptible @xmath0 and infected @xmath1 is the key to understand the rate at which the infection can spread in the population",
    ". models with bilinear interaction among populations @xmath2 tend to disease free equilibrium or endemic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "researchers have considered various interactions of non - linear type such as @xmath3 @xcite , @xmath4 @xcite , or @xmath5",
    "@xcite for further understanding dynamics of infectious diseases .",
    "it is observed that solutions of periodic nature do exist even without periodic forcing term in the model .",
    "the existence of periodic solutions are usually attributed to the presence of time delays in the system even in case of bilinear incidence .",
    "delays do exist in disease transmission , known as the latency period of infection , from inception to an identifiable state .",
    "for some interesting studies on infectious disease models , readers are referred to @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , fluctuations in populations may also be attributed to changes in environment , especially , in open systems .",
    "these perturbations are influenced by the environment and may be treated as noise in the system .",
    "dynamic models of competing species under the influence of a noise are extensively studied in @xcite .",
    "predictive models based on both clinical , incidence data pertaining to infectious diseases and epidemics in general are discussed in @xcite .    in the earlier studies on infectious disease models , the identification of basic reproduction number gave an idea on the stability of the system either in terms of disease free environment or disease prevalence .",
    "the reproduction number represents the number of secondary cases that are caused by a primary case when introduced into a wholly susceptible population .",
    "also , it is observed that if reproduction number is less than unity , the disease free equilibrium is stable , otherwise , the disease prevails @xcite . when the nature of interaction is not known or the basic reproduction number is more than unity , one needs to find ways to restrict the disease to a minimum , manageable level , if the disease free environment can not be provided .",
    "when it comes to the control of a disease , vaccination or preventive strategies could be a good choice during the early stages of the disease provided the population is not large enough .",
    "emergence of vaccine resistant strains is one of the drawbacks of frequent or long term vaccination .",
    "when massive vaccination is not possible , the second stage of defensive mechanism could be medical treatment .",
    "this adds a new sub category of population called recovered class representing the population recovered by treatment .",
    "basing on the above observations , we consider the following three compartmental system in the present paper , @xmath6 wherein , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote susceptible , infected and recovered ( by treatment ) populations at any time @xmath10 respectively , @xmath11 denotes the time derivative of a function , @xmath12 is the growth rate of susceptible population , @xmath13 denotes the non - linear incidence or infection function showing how susceptibles @xmath14 are converted into infected @xmath15 @xmath16 denotes the rate of contact or interaction of infected with susceptible and @xmath17 is the rate of removal of such susceptible individuals from the system who are naturally immune to the infection and in no way get infected , @xmath18 is the vaccination function ( depends on susceptible population ) , @xmath19 is the rate of successful vaccination and @xmath20 is the rate of conversion of susceptible into infected .    in case , @xmath21 we may expect the infection to be at its helm and spreading @xmath22 .",
    "if @xmath23 we may infer that the disease is not that effective or the missing @xmath24s are no more susceptible and may be removed from the system .",
    "the time delay @xmath25 implies that @xmath14 when gets in contact with @xmath26 takes time ` @xmath27 ' to become infected and is called the temporary immunity parameter .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 is the removal / death rate of the infected population - either not at all treated or inadequately treated or beyond the treatment .",
    "it may also be viewed as the rate at which infected population is kept in a quarantine , away from susceptible population avoiding any sort of contact between infected and exposed , @xmath29 is the recovery ( by treatment ) function of the infected , @xmath30 denotes the rate of treatment and also the recovery rate .",
    "however , the infected by a treatment procedure may recover after a time gap @xmath31 the parameter @xmath32 is the rate at which a recovered ( non - vaccinated ) individual may be re - exposed to infection and become susceptible again .",
    "this case arises when the individual appears to be recovered by treatment but is prone to infection again .",

    "@xmath35 @xmath36 3 .",
    "@xmath37    the first condition ( non - negativity ) is a minimum requirement for any function representing biological systems and for dynamics to make sense , the second condition arises out of the situation when there are no susceptible , i.e. , @xmath26 has no more influence on them and the third condition is required to create a disease - free environment . necessity for such condition",
    "is described in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "in addition , a non - negativity condition is to be satisfied by @xmath38 as it represents the recovery ( by treatment ) function .",
    "thus , we assume @xmath39 @xmath40 with strict inequality holding for @xmath41 as we are interested in studying the influence of treatment on spread of disease . in the absence of infected population",
    ", we have @xmath42 as no treatment effort is required .",
    "depending on the reproduction number of an epidemic and its availability , we need to initiate vaccination .",
    "the following are the probable cases , ( i ) a uniform constant supply @xmath43 ( ii ) a fixed constant or proportional to susceptible population @xmath44 ( linear ) , ( iii ) sub - linear @xmath45 or @xmath46 ( have a saturation limit ) , and ( iv ) @xmath18 may be a periodic function when the infection is fluctuating , season - dependent or cyclic",
    ". however , in case of a new infectious disease , system may not be ready with vaccines to prevent its spread , the recent case being the spread of ebola @xcite .",
    "thus , a time gap is required to start the vaccination procedure until a vaccine is invented and supplied .",
    "so , we may have @xmath47 @xmath48 , such that , @xmath49 and @xmath50 @xmath51 a delay is also warranted in this section which we shall discuss in the final section .",
    "a basic motivation for this study stems from observations in @xcite that vaccination alone is not sufficient to contain disease effectively and treatment plays an important role in the disease management .",
    "we shall analyze the model ( [ eqn1 ] ) keeping in view the following concerns which are important in handling infectious disease :    1 .   the influence of treatment or recovery rate _",

    "in example [ ex53 ] , it is noticed that the equilibrium @xmath363 is locally stable as long as the time delay in infection @xmath402 thereafter this equilibrium becomes unstable as predicted by the theory ( see results in sections [ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] ) . at the same time , simulations show that for @xmath403 the system is behaving very wild and large fluctuations are observed in infected and recovered populations .",
    "this situation is more vulnerable than having a stable endemic equilibrium where the situation may not be much beyond control .",

    "study in section [ subsec34 ] may provide an estimate but for other types of delays , more explicit estimates are required .",

    "@xmath404 + this has both disease free @xmath345 and endemic @xmath405 equilibria . but neither theorem [ th42 ] nor theorem [ th41 ] holds for this case . also system ( [ eqn55 ] ) in example [ ex55 ] allows no possibility for existence of a disease free equilibrium , and hence , no scope for disease free environment .",
    "comments made in section [ subsec21 ] are aimed at such situations . in such cases",

    "how to control @xmath26 ? can we find a small @xmath406 such that @xmath407 for some @xmath408 can we create an inactive state ( a zone of no activation ) for the spreading of the disease ?",
    "that means can we identify and keep the infected people in a quarantine ( at least till vaccination is effective or treatment available is sufficient to meet the requirements ) ?",
    "this would be the point of contention in our future exposition .",
    "+    it is observed in @xcite that for diseases like chagas , the effort of vaccination is not adequate to control the disease and treatment is recommended in both acute and chronic stages of diseases .",
    "system ( [ eqn21 ] ) through examples [ ex51 ] to [ ex57 ] illustrates such cases .",
    "our examples conclude that when the treatment rate is high , a disease - free environment is created ( stability of @xmath338 - example [ ex51 ] to stability of @xmath345 - example [ ex52 ] ) . in the presence of improved vaccination effort alone , the infected and hence ,",
    "recovered populations are lowered ( stability of @xmath338 - example [ ex51 ] to stability of @xmath363 - example [ ex53 ] ) . under the influence of better vaccination in addition to high treatment rate , we notice a considerable decrease in susceptible population due to increased rate of infection ( stability of @xmath345 - example [ ex52 ] to stability of @xmath372 - example [ ex54 ] ) .",
    "it would be interesting to see how far our model explains the dynamics of chagas disease .",
    "+ on the whole , our common expectations on the model really come true and this prompts us to analyze this model further with regard to its applicability for understanding various infectious diseases - this would be our scope of future study .",
    "we need to present simpler conditions on parameters and provide results for global asymptotic stability for general infection functions @xmath409 + also , global stability analysis of the model with general interaction , vaccination and recovery functions is in the offing .",
    "infection rate , treatment rate and vaccination are the three important parameters that essentially decide the dynamics of the spread of a disease .",
    "an effort has to be made for estimation of these parameters in order to decide the measures of control of disease .",
    "our investigation on these lines will be made open soon .",
    "we shall now propose some modifications to ( [ eqn1 ] ) taking into consideration some realistic phenomena .",
    "we present the following cases as open research problems that would form a part of our further research ,    1 .",
    "we have assumed the growth rate of susceptible population @xmath410 in ( [ eqn1 ] ) as a fixed constant .",
    "this assumption holds good when the susceptible population receives input from a large society and the disease visits for a limited period during which the reproduction of susceptible , infected and/or recovered population is not significant .",
    "however , in case of chronic diseases such as aids , chagas e.t.c .",
    ", offspring of all three populations may make sizeable contribution to the system .",
    "thus , we may consider , + @xmath411 + here @xmath412 denotes the growth function of susceptible population .",
    "2 .   vaccination well before an attack by the disease is rare . may be it is possible in a well prepared society ?",
    "but in most of the cases , vaccine is not readily available and a delay in its preparation or supply is natural .",
    "this may be viewed in two directions . 1 .",
    "vaccine takes time @xmath413 to develop immunity so that susceptible population vaccinated at time @xmath414 are immune at time @xmath311 hence , such population may be removed from the system .",
    "thus , we have + @xmath415 + notice that we have taken @xmath416 in ( [ eqn1 ] ) for this case .",
    "vaccination effort being carried out at time @xmath10 depends on a previous estimation of population .",
    "that is , we choose @xmath417 in ( [ eqn1 ] ) .",
    "we have + @xmath418 3 .   recovered population may take time to become susceptible again .",
    "that means , they could retain health for some time , say , @xmath419 this may be represented in ( [ eqn1 ] ) as , + @xmath420 4 .   though mathematical models can describe many plausible realistic phenomena , their usefulness is acceptable only if they stand the test on the real time data .",
    "thus , it would be interesting to test the results of this article with available real time data so that necessary modifications or improvement of ( [ eqn1 ] ) may be taken up suitably . 5 .",
    "consider the influence of sudden environmental changes or other measures taken up to control the spread of disease ( may be described as noise in the system ) .",
    "introducing such term in ( [ eqn1 ] ) , we have + @xmath421 + here @xmath422 for all @xmath423 may be understood as the rate at which infected population is decreasing owing to changes in environment that are non - conducive for infection or measures taken up to keep the infected away from the system ( isolation ) or measures taken up by society for controlling the spread of the disease .",
