    "there is an ever - growing theoretical and observational evidence that the dark masses present in some galactic nuclei and x - ray binaries are black holes ( rees 1998 ) .",
    "several ways have been suggested of how to deduce the properties of these black holes .",
    "the first rough estimates of their mass were based on energy considerations and limits implied by the shortest variability timescale ( e.g.  begelman , blandford , & rees 1984 ) .",
    "more precise methods became possible with modern observational techniques like hst , vlbi and x - ray satellites .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to propose and further discuss a method to determine the parameters of a black hole in a system with two periodic components in the observed signal which are due to orbital motion of a stellar object and its passages through the accretion disk of the hole .",
    "we start with a brief summary of the subject .    in galactic nuclei , the existence and size of the dark central mass are deduced from the curve of the central surface brightness of the nuclei and from the spatial distribution and dynamics of surrounding gas and stars ( see kormendy & richstone 1995 for a review and references ) . in particular , the standard model for active galactic nuclei ( agns ) with a black hole and an accretion disk ( e.g.  rees 1984 ; blandford & rees 1992 ) has been further supported when the nuclear gas in several active galaxies was found to be in a gravity - dominated nearly circular motion in a disk ( e.g.  jaffe et al .",
    "1993 ; gallimore , baum , & odea 1997 ) .",
    "rotation curves of the observed nuclear gas disks indicate a central compact dark mass of some ( 2.03.5)@xmath0@xmath1 in m87 ( ngc 4486 ) ( merritt & oh 1997 ; macchetto et al .",
    "1997 ) , of about 4.9@xmath0@xmath2 in ngc 4261 ( ferrarese , ford , & jaffe 1996 ) , and of 3.6@xmath0@xmath3 in ngc 4258 ( miyoshi et al .  1995 ; maoz 1995 ) .",
    "the observed excess of quasars at high redshifts has stimulated a search for black holes in quiescent galaxies , since they may have been both the engine and then the residue of a former activity ( haehnelt & rees 1993 ) . in this case",
    "the most reliable present data come from the observations of stellar motion ( van den bosch & de zeeuw 1996 ) .",
    "velocity profiles of several stellar nuclear disks offer strong evidence for black holes  of 2.6@xmath0@xmath4 in our own galaxy ( genzel et al .  1997 ;",
    "mezger , duschl , & zylka 1996 ) , of 2@xmath0@xmath1 in ngc 3115 ( kormendy et al .",
    "1996a ) , of 1@xmath0@xmath1 in ngc 4594 ( the sombrero galaxy ) ( kormendy et al .",
    "1996b ) , of 3@xmath0@xmath4 in m32 ( van den marel et al .",
    "1997 ) , and probably also of 6@xmath0@xmath2 in ngc 4486b ( kormendy et al .",

    "however , current optical and radio studies still probe only regions above @xmath5 gravitational radii of the putative holes which is by far not enough to resolve any imprints of the relativistic effects due to the collapsed centre , and in particular to deduce the rate of its rotation .",
    "information from within the region of a few tens of gravitational radii have been brought by x - ray satellite observations of a sample of seyfert 1 galaxies ( nandra et al .",
    "1997 and references therein ; see also fabian 1997 for a survey , and tanaka et al .",
    "1995 for the best - quality measurement from mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ) .",
    "these observations yielded the profiles of the fluorescent iron k@xmath6 emission line which is likely to be induced by illumination of the very inner parts of an accretion disk by a source off the disk plane ( e.g.  matt , perola , piro , & stella 1992 ; petrucci & henri 1997 ) .",
    "indeed , the observed broad profile skewed to lower energies is best explained in terms of the doppler and gravitational redshifts ( fabian et al .",
    "1995 ) ; the exact origin of the illuminating source remains unclear .",
    "evidence for smallness of the emitting regions also comes from the resolved rapid variability of the k@xmath6 lines ( nandra et al .",
    "1997 , and references therein ) .",
    "note that recently bao et al .",
    "( 1997 ) reminded another unique ( and measurable ) feature of black hole sources involving accretion disk : the energy - dependent variability of polarization of their x - rays , originally discussed by stark & connors ( 1977 ) .    a way to estimate parameters of the central black hole",
    "is strongly related to the source variability .",
    "it is assumed , in fact , that a time delay between variations of the emission line strength of the agn and that of the continuum can be due to the time travel between the central source and the surrounding line - emitting gas .",
    "radial distance and velocity of propagation of the disturbances impose limits on the black - hole mass ( blandford & mckee 1982 ; krolik et al .",
    "1991 ) , but the resulting estimates inherit uncertainties of the underlying assumptions .",
    "alternatively , it has been proposed to deduce the masses of the central nuclear bodies from temporal changes of the observed emission lines ( stella 1990 ) , while rotational parameters from the position , intensity , width ( hameury , marck , & pelat 1994 ; martocchia & matt 1996 ) , and profile of the lines ( bromley , chen , & miller 1997 ; dabrowski et al.1997 ; reynolds & begelman 1997 ; rybicky & bromley 1998 ; cf .",
    "also bao , hadrava , & stgaard 1994 and 1996 ) .",
    "the x - ray photometric light - curve profile from a hot spot orbiting not far from the horizon also reflects rotation of the black hole ( asaoka 1989 ; karas 1996 ) .",
    "similar research has been focused on galactic x - ray binaries where a central engine was also proposed , namely an accretion disk fed by overflow from a secondary star . here",
    "the evidence for a black hole involves non - stellar appearance ( `` invisibility '' ) of one of the components , the presence of x - radiation , variability , spectral features ( mainly the presence of relatively strong ultrasoft component and of hard x - ray tail ) , and of course a large lower limit on mass of the dark component ( @xmath7 ) , deduced from the orbital parameters of the ( stellar ) companion ( namely from the mass function of the system ) .",
    "( see the surveys in lewin , van paradijs , & van den heuvel 1995 ; the reviews of black - hole binaries with a thorough list of references have also been given by barret , mcclintock , & grindlay 1996 ; charles 1997 .",
    "later results are due to beekman et al .",
    "1996 and 1997 ; orosz & bailyn 1997 . )",
    "it has been proposed recently to infer the parameters of the dark component from observable behaviour of the disk .",
    "an observable modulation of the x - ray emission may be caused by disk vibrations whose lowest frequency depends on the mass and rotation of the hole ( nowak et al .",
    "1997 and references therein ) .",
    "zhang et al .",
    "( 1997 ) proposed , also on the basis of the standard thin accretion disk model , how the angular momentum ( spin ) of the black hole in an x - ray binary could be inferred from the strength of an ultrasoft x - component . very recently",
    "cui , zhang , & chen ( 1998 ) have proposed `` that certain types of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) observed in the light - curves of black - hole binaries are produced by x - ray modulation at the precession frequency of accretion disks , because of relativistic dragging of inertial frames around spinning black holes '' .",
    "given the mass of the hole , they are able to derive its spin by comparing the computed disk precession frequency with that of the observed quasi - periodic oscillations .",
    "this mechanism requires a warped accretion disk , the assumption that clearly calls for further investigation ( markovi & lamb 1998 ) .",
    "scheme for the source variability discussed in the present paper is different from that which has been proposed for qpos in the above - mentioned papers . here ,",
    "an orbiting companion of the black hole is involved  the assumption which restricts variability time - scales relevant for the model .",
    "narayan , mcclintock , & yi ( 1996 ) , and narayan , garcia , & mcclintock ( 1997 ) argued that the black - hole x - ray binaries could also be recognized according to a larger variation in luminosity between their bright and faint states than is expected in the sources with neutron stars .",
    "this way of identifying black holes follows from the low radiative efficiency of advection - dominated accretion flows which could occur around black holes ( with greater `` sucking - in '' power and no solid surface ) rather than around other compact objects .",
    "various under - luminous accretion - powered astrophysical systems , mainly quiescent transient x - ray sources and low - luminosity galactic nuclei , could be interpreted as black holes with advection - dominated accretion disks ( see lasota & abramowicz 1997 for a survey ) ; reynolds et al .  ( 1996 ) suggested that advection - dominated mode of the final stages of accretion could also account for the `` quiescence '' of the black hole in m87 .",
    "the lack of a hard surface of a black hole also plays crucial role in an alternative explanation by king , kolb , & szuszkiewicz ( 1997 ) of x - ray transients which are dynamical black - hole candidates , namely in terms of a weaker ( stabilizing ) irradiation of the disk by the central accreting source .    in the present paper",
    "we propose a method applicable , under certain assumptions , to the black - hole sources with periodic components of variability .",
    "it provides , unambiguously , _ both the mass and the specific angular momentum of the black hole in physical units_. we start from the model of possible periodic variability of black - hole sources which considers a thin accretion disk lying in the hole s equatorial plane , and an object ( a `` star '' ) which intersects the disk periodically while orbiting about the centre .",
    "such a system is characterized by two angular frequencies  that of azimuthal revolution of the star and that of its latitudinal oscillation about the equatorial plane .",
    "both frequencies are in principle measurable at infinity , the azimuthal one from spectrophotometry , while the latitudinal one from photometry provided that the passages of the star produce a strong enough modulation of the source .",
    "karas & vokrouhlick ( 1994 ) illustrated , by fourier analysis of simulated photometric data , how the respective two peaks can be recognized in the power spectrum . this model was cultivated notably in connection with the ngc  6814 galaxy whose putative variability , however , was later recognized as being due to a source in our galaxy .",
    "other possible targets are discussed in the current literature .",
    "for example , optical outbursts in the blazar oj  287 have recently been modelled in terms of a black - hole binary system by villata et al.(1998 ) .",
    "( the source exhibits several time - scales : feature - less short - term variability , 12-yr cycle , and , possibly , a 60-yr cycle . ) these authors , however , presume both components to be of comparable masses while in our calculation frequencies are determined under assumption that the secondary is much less massive than the primary ( cf . also sundelius et al .",
    "1997 ) . as another example ,",
    "a 16-hr periodicity in the x - ray signal from the seyfert galaxy iras 18325 - 5926 was described by iwasawa et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "let us suppose that the disk has only a weak dynamical influence on the star and that stellar tides are negligible ( the star is assumed much smaller than the typical curvature radius of the field around ) as well as gravitational radiation and self - gravity both of the disk and of the star itself .",
    "then the worldline of the star is very close to a geodesic in a pure gravitational field of the central rotating black hole .",
    "this is described by the kerr metric which reads ( misner , thorne & wheeler 1973 , p.  878 ) , in boyer - lindquist spheroidal coordinates ( @xmath8 ) , in geometrized units ( in which @xmath9 , @xmath10 being the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath11 the gravitational constant ) and with the ( @xmath12+++ ) signature of the metric tensor ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote mass and specific rotational angular momentum of the source and @xmath17 @xmath18    it has been demonstrated ( syer , clarke , & rees 1991 ; vokrouhlick & karas 1993 , 1998 ) that under the above - described circumstances the stellar orbit undergoes three secular changes : a decrease of the semi - major axis ( the star spirals towards the centre due to the loss of energy in collisions with the disk ) , circularization ( the orbit becomes spherical , @xmath19 ) , and a decrease of the amplitude of precession of the orbital plane about the equatorial plane of the centre ( the orbit gradually declines into the disk plane ) . since the time scale for circularization is typically found shorter than , or of the same order as , the time scale necessary to drag the orbit into the disk , one can expect that at late stages of evolution of the hole - disk - star system the star follows a nearly equatorial spherical geodesic .",
    "this stage is also the one in which the star stays for a relatively long time .    in the next section",
    "we discuss relevant properties of a precessing orbit in the kerr spacetime .",
    "then , in sect",
    ". [ eqset ] , we derive simple relations which appear to be appropriate for practical study of the relevant objects .",
    "equations further simplify if the object orbits not very close to the black hole , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ simple ] .",
    "our method employs also the observed emission - line profiles which were vastly studied in recent literature ; we summarize the relevant formulae and results in appendix  a.",
    "for a general spherical geodesic in the kerr spacetime , the frequencies of the azimuthal and latitudinal motion are given by rather complicated formulas involving elliptic integrals ( wilkins 1972 ; karas & vokrouhlick 1994 ) .",
    "however , the formulas simplify considerably in the case of a nearly equatorial geodesic",
    ". the azimuthal angular velocity @xmath20 ( with respect to an observer at rest at radial infinity ) can be approximated by that of the equatorial circular geodesic ( bardeen , press , & teukolsky 1972 ) , @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the corresponding values of the `` reduced frequency '' , in general defined by @xmath23 ( de felice 1994 ) , and the upper / lower sign corresponds to prograde / retrograde orbit . )",
    "cases for completeness , but solely the prograde trajectory can be considered : the accretion disk is more likely to be corotating with the central black hole and it has been shown that the interaction with the disk makes also the star corotate eventually . ]",
    "the angular frequency @xmath24 of ( small ) harmonic latitudinal oscillations about the equatorial plane is given , for a spherical orbit with _",

    "the expression ( [ omega ] ) was obtained by de felice & usseglio - tomasset ( 1996 ) , in studying the behaviour of a gedanken apparatus baptized `` pharaoh s fan '' ( de felice & usseglio - tomasset 1992 ) , as a result of the analysis of the equation of relative deviation ; for a simpler derivation by perturbation of the equatorial circular orbit , see semerk & de felice ( 1997 ) .",
    "we will briefly describe the `` pharaoh s fan '' because the equations describing its behaviour are relevant also for the present work .",
    "the device consists of a monopole test particle in a non - friction short narrow pipe which constrains the particle s motion in two spatial dimensions but leaves it free in the remaining direction .",
    "it was considered with the purpose to provide a space traveller with a measurement which , together with several other quasi - local experiments , yields a complete and non - ambiguous information about spacetime and about the orbit ( semerk & de felice 1997 ) . when the observer is moving on a ( generally non - keplerian ) equatorial circular trajectory in the kerr field and has the pipe turned to latitudinal direction , symmetrically to the orbital ( i.e.  equatorial ) plane , the centre of the pipe is the particle s stable equilibrium position .",
    "if released after being perturbed slightly off the equilibrium , the particle harmonically oscillates ( `` the fan waves '' ) about the equatorial plane , with the proper frequency @xmath24 .",
    "this can not be made vanish by any choice of the angular velocity @xmath28 , since , in kerr spacetime , it is not possible to orbit freely on circular orbits at a constant non - equatorial latitude ( de felice 1979 ) . except for the case",
    "@xmath29 ( the schwarzschild spacetime around a nonrotating centre ) , @xmath30 is _ not _ equal to the square of the proper azimuthal frequency , @xmath31 , as a result of the `` dragging '' effect of mass currents existing within the rotating source ( lense & thirring 1918 ; wilkins 1972 ) .",
    "while the problem itself of the astronaut s orientability in black - hole fields is yet of a limited practical usefulness , a question was raised ( de felice & usseglio - tomasset 1992 ; semerk & de felice 1997 ) whether some kind of correspondence could be established between the local experiments and the data which can be measured `` at infinity '' . in the case of the agns or stellar - size x - ray sources , such a link",
    "is provided by the orbiting star as discussed above since it plays the role of the `` pharaoh s fan '' ; in fact , the frequency of disk crossing would just be twice the fan s frequency @xmath24 .",
    "( since the star is free also in the radial direction , no pipe is necessary to constrain it . )",

    "note that also the star may be affected by the collisions and tidal forces considerably  it may lose its outer layers or even become disrupted ( frank & rees 1976 ; marck , lioure , & bonazzola 1996 ; diener et al .",
    "1997 ; loeb & ulmer 1997 ) .",
    "a stripped stellar core is an intense source of ( ir)radiation which may survive for many orbital periods ( rees 1998 ) . in any case",
    ", we assumed here that the star is only _ weakly _ affected by the disk , i.e.  that its orbit may well be approximated by a nearly equatorial spherical geodesic .",
    "radiation from the presumed accretion disks can be modulated by their precession , vibrations and various instabilities .",
    "it is also very well possible that the disks are covered by numerous irregularities ( phenomenologically designated as bright spots ) , contributing to the featureless short - term x - ray variability which is indeed observed ( abramowicz et al .",
    "1991 ; mangalam & wiita 1993 ) .",
    "then our scheme must anticipate that well - separated , profound irregularities develop on the disk surface ( due to stellar passage ) and survive several orbital periods .",
    "although no agn or black - hole x - ray binary with clear periodic variability is currently known , the cases of rapidly variable k@xmath6 line ( iwasawa et al .",
    "1996 ; yaqoob et al .",
    "1996 ) , and that of quasi - periodic agns ( papadakis & lawrence 1993 ; lehto & valtonen 1996 ; stothers & sillanp 1997 ; valtonen & lehto 1997 ) and x - ray sources ( callanan et al .  1992 ; pavlenko et al.1996 ; belloni et al .  1997 ; steiman - cameron & scargle 1997 ; iwasawa et al .",
    "1998 ) suggest that some periodic components are present in the signal .",
    "thus we conclude with m.  j.  rees ( 1998 ) : _ `` there is a real chance that someday observers will find evidence that an agn is being modulated by an orbiting star , which would act as a test particle whose orbital precession would probe the metric in the domain where the distinctive features of the kerr geometry should show up clearly .
