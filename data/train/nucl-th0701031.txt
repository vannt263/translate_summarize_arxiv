    "the properties of the relativistic fermi gas ( rfg ) model of the nucleus @xcite have inspired the idea of superscaling . in the rfg model , the responses of the system to an external perturbation",
    "are related to a universal function of a properly defined scaling variable which depends on the energy and the momentum transferred to the system . with the adjective universal",
    "we want to indicate that the scaling function is independent of the momentum transfer , and also of the number of nucleons .",
    "these properties are respectively called scaling of first and second kind .",
    "furthermore , the scaling function can be defined in such a way to result in independence also of the specific type of external one - body operator .",
    "this feature is usually called scaling of zeroth kind @xcite .",
    "one has superscaling when the three kinds of scaling we have described are verified .",
    "this happens in the rfg model .",
    "the theoretical hypothesis of superscaling can be empirically tested by extracting response functions from the experimental cross sections and by studying their scaling behaviours .",
    "the responses of the nucleus to electroweak probes can be extracted from the lepton - nucleus cross sections by dividing them by the single - nucleon cross sections properly weighted to account for the number of protons and neutrons .",
    "in addition , one has to divide the obtained responses by the appropriate electroweak form factors .",
    "inclusive electron scattering data in the quasi - elastic region have been analyzed in this way @xcite .",
    "the main result of these studies is that the longitudinal responses show superscaling behaviour . to be more specific , scaling of second kind , independence of the nucleus ,",
    "is better fulfilled than the scaling of first kind , independence of the momentum transfer .",
    "the situation for the transverse responses is much more complicated .",
    "the presence of superscaling features in the data is relevant not only by itself , but mainly because this property can be used to make predictions . in effect , from a specific set of longitudinal response data @xcite , an empirical universal scaling function has been extracted @xcite and has been used to obtain neutrino - nucleus cross sections in the quasi - elastic region @xcite .",
    "we observed that this universal scaling function is quite different from that predicted by the rfg model .",
    "this indicates the presence of physical effects not included in the rfg model , but still conserving the scaling properties .",
    "we have investigated the superscaling behaviour of some of the effects not considered in the rfg model .",
    "they are : the finite size of the system , its collective excitations , the short - range correlations ( src ) , the meson exchange currents ( mec ) and the final state interactions ( fsi ) .",
    "the inclusion of these effects produce scaling functions rather similar to the empirical ones .    before presenting our results , we recall in sec . [",
    "sec : formalism ] the basic expressions of the superscaling formalism .",

    "our universal empirical and theoretical scaling functions are used to calculate electron and neutrino inclusive cross sections .",
    "these results are compared with those obtained by calculating the same cross sections with our nuclear model .",

    "[ fig : fexp ] .    a second remark regarding fig .",
    "[ fig : ee_xsect ] , is about the fact that our results underestimate the data .",
    "probably this is because the excitation of the @xmath83 resonance is not considered in our calculations .",
    "the behaviour of the data of the figure in the higher energy part , show the presence of the @xmath83 resonance .",
    "the low energy tail of the excitation of this resonance affect also the quasi - elastic peak .",
    "the situation for the double differential cross sections is well controlled , since all the kinematic variables , beam energy , scattering angle , energy of the detected lepton , are precisely defined , and , consequently , also energy and momentum transferred to the nucleus .",
    "the situation changes for the total cross sections which are of major interest for the neutrino physics .",
    "the total cross sections are only function of the energy of the incoming lepton , therefore they consider all the scattering angles and the possible values of the energy and momentum transferred to the nucleus , with the only limitation of the global energy and momentum conservations .",

    "the calculation with the scaling functions fails in reproducing the results of the full calculation in the region of low energy and momentum transfer , where surface and collective effects are important .",

    "we have seen that these effects strongly violate the scaling . at @xmath99 = 200 mev the cross section obtained with @xmath100 is about 20% larger than those obtained with the full calculation . this difference becomes smaller with increasing energy and is about 7% at @xmath99 = 300 mev .",
    "this is an indication that the relative weight of the non scaling kinematic regions become smaller with the increasing neutrino energy .",

    "we can summarize the main points of this first part of our investigation by saying that the effects beyond the rfg model we have considered , strongly modify the scaling functions , but do not destroy their scaling .",
    "this explain the good scaling properties of the experimental longitudinal electromagnetic responses , which are not affected by the excitation of the @xmath83 resonance , an effect not included in our calculations .",
    "after studying the scaling properties of the various responses we have investigated the reliability of the cross sections predicted by using the scaling functions .",
    "the idea is to assume that superscaling is verified , i.e. all the three kinds of scaling we have considered , and then to use the scaling functions to predict the cross sections .",
