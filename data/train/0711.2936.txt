    "existence of a considerable amount of cold dark matter in the present universe has been regarded as a robust ingredient in recent astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "several hypothetical particles were suggested in order to solve the problem of the cold dark matter . some of them are bosons : axions , q - balls  the others are fermions : neutralinos , axinos , gravitinos , quintessino ",
    "(one can read a good summary about the non - barionic dark matter candidates in @xcite . )",
    "we study some general features of the degenerate fermionic matter here .",
    "degeneracy means that every energy states are occupied , that is such a system is spherical symmetric and does not rotate .",
    "our aim is to determine the maximal possible mass of _ static _ degenerate fermion balls .",
    "first we make a naive non - relativistic estimation because the non - relativistic system has been studied in the literature for decades .",
    "several papers were devoted to the non - relativistic degenerate fermionic dark matter with or wihtout barionic component ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "papers whose topic is some aspect of the relativistic behaviour of these systems are rare ( @xcite ) .",
    "we devote the second part of this paper to giving an exact relativistic mass limit for these systems . in the third part of the paper we study the influence of the annihilation of the particles on this mass limit .",
    "in non - relativistic case we use polytropic equation of state , in relativistic case we do not use such approximation but the exact equation which one can get for degenerate fermions .    if we assume that the dark matter consists of neutral , weakly interacting fermions , their spatial distribution is driven by gravity and fermi distribution .",
    "@xmath0 is valid for such kind of particles today , that is if the density is sufficiently high , the degenerate ( @xmath1 k ) fermi distribution approximates the real distribution well .",
    "@xmath2 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath3 is their temperature , @xmath4 is their rest mass and @xmath5 is the speed of light .",
    "one can write that @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mass density of particles , @xmath8 is their fermi momentum and @xmath9 is the planck constant . if the particles are majorana spinors , the @xmath10 factor is 8 .",
    "if dirac spinors , then 16 .",
    "we dispense with barionic matter and deal only with one component dark matter .",
    "this assumption is not good for cosmological scales but probably suitable for smaller scales .",
    "we derive the equations of the system first .",
    "we can obtain @xmath11 from ( [ fermi ] ) : @xmath12 the energy density for non - relativistic case is @xmath13 we can integrate it easily @xmath14 @xmath15 is valid for ideal gases .",
    "we know the equation of state now : @xmath16    navier  stokes equations are very simple for spherical symmetric matter distribution in hydrostatic equilibrium : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the distance from the origin and @xmath19 is the gravitational potential .",
    "one needs also the poisson equation @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the gravitational constant .",
    "it can be reformulated for spherical symmetric case : @xmath22    if one substitutes @xmath23 in ( [ navierstokes ] ) from ( [ allegy ] ) and integrates it , then gets relation between @xmath7 and @xmath19 : @xmath24^{3/2}$ ] , where @xmath25 is the constant of integration . with this",
    "the navier  stokes equation is : @xmath26 .",
    "if we introduce the following variables @xmath27 ( where @xmath28 ) and @xmath29 , then it becomes very simple : @xmath30 it is the well known emden equation for @xmath31 . when one solves this equation , has only one free parameter , @xmath32 , because @xmath33 must be 0 in order to avoid singularity at @xmath34 .",
    "in the non - relativistic case we can make a raw estimation of upper limit of the mass of such a fermion ball .",
    "the mass density can be calculated from the previous relations @xmath35 . if we put this into the common expression of total mass , we get the following @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote the radius of this object , where the mass density drops to zero",
    ". we can introduce @xmath40 notation for the integral and @xmath41 for the constant factor excluded the @xmath4 .",
    "then we have @xmath42 .",
    "we know the general scaling feature of this equation @xmath43 ( see @xcite for example ) , that is @xmath44 , where the numerical value of @xmath45 is approximately 132.384 .",
    "if the mass reaches the schwarzschild mass limit , we get a black hole with @xmath46 . after some algebra",
    "one can write relation between @xmath47 and @xmath4 @xmath48 if @xmath47 is measured in solar masses and @xmath4 in gev , it means @xmath49 in dirac case and @xmath50 in majorana case .",
    "for spherical symmetric case the metric can be written in the form    @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the function of @xmath18 and @xmath54 .",
    "we study the static case here , that is @xmath55 , @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "one can obtain the einstein equations from this and the stress - energy tensor of the ideal gas for static case : @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 where @xmath23 is the pressure and @xmath60 is the energy density of ideal gas .",
    "prime denotes the differentiation along @xmath18 .",

    "the best choice is to use @xmath11 as an independent variable instead of @xmath23 or @xmath7 .",
    "one needs an equation for @xmath11 now .",
    "it can be derived from the feature of stress - energy tensor @xmath65 : @xmath66 if one substitutes @xmath23 and @xmath7 in ( [ rho1 ] ) , he obtains for @xmath11 : @xmath67    the system ( [ nu2 ] ) , ( [ pf ] ) contains two unknowns and two ordinary differential equations , that is it can be solved .",
    "( ( [ density ] ) , ( [ pressure ] ) are only implicite auxiliary equations in technical sense . )",
    "the calculations themselves follow closely oppenheimer and volkov s calculations @xcite .",
    "this system has a scaling feature which can be seen without solving the equations .",

    "we need initial conditions .",
    "@xmath52 does not occur explicitely in the equations , only its derivatives .",

    "one of them ends at @xmath90 and the other at @xmath91 .",
    "the curve ending at @xmath91 spreads to larger volume than its dirac counterpart because there is no so many energy states in the phasespace as in dirac case , that is the central density is lower in this case .",
    "the curve ending at @xmath90 contains more mass than its dirac counterpart because this higer mass can `` press '' the majorana matter to the smaller volume .",
    "it is the qualitative reason why the majorana curve in fig.[fig : mr ] is shifted to the right and up .",
    "quantitatively one can get the majorana curve in fig.[fig : mr ] from the dirac one if @xmath18 and @xmath87 are multiplied by a factor @xmath92 .",

    "we can conclude that this @xmath83 is the mass limit which we have been looking for . if we take into account the scaling feature , we have @xmath94 in dirac case and @xmath95 in majorana case ( @xmath87 is in units of solar mass and @xmath4 in gev ) .",

    "one can read a good review about this topic in bertone s report @xcite ( see also the references therein ) .",
    "we study the effect of the annihilation on the upper mass limit now .",
    "we can expand the velocity averaged cross section in a taylor series : @xmath96 we do not know the value of the factors .",
    "one can only estimate upper limits of the total @xmath97 in a given range of @xmath4 .",
    "we use beacom s estimations @xcite .",
    "we calculate the final mass of such objects after 13.7 gyear ( age of the universe ) with these upper limits started from the @xmath83 obtained in the previous section .",
    "it gives lower bound on the limit mass .",
    "( we have to note that it is not a lower bound on the mass of these objects because it is , of course , zero . )",
    "we do not make big error in the calculations of the decaying time and the final mass probably if we use the @xmath98 non - relatvistic approximation .",
    "it is known that @xmath99 in non - relativistic case @xcite , where @xmath100 is the initial mass and @xmath101 is the characteristic time of the decaying ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "it means that the decaying is very fast at the beginning and slower later .",

    "the upper two curves show the upper limit of the limit mass if there is not annihilation .",
    "the lowest two curved lines show the mass limit after @xmath111 year annihilation started from the upper curves , two curved lines above these two belong to @xmath112 year annihilation . we depict them because beacom s estimations of @xmath97 give values for the cross section in the late universe .",
    "one can observe that even after this shorter time the mass limit is well below the limit without annihilation .",
    "we know further that if the @xmath97 is larger than the natural limit , two horizontal lines , then the dark matter can not be thermal relic .",
    "unfortunately the lower limit not strict but we can state this now . probably the real cross section is much below the limits given by beacom .",

    "we studied self - gravitating systems of weakly interacting fermions .",
    "we determined the limit mass above which systems undergo gravitational collapse .",
    "we could see that this limit mass is a function of the rest mass of the particles : @xmath113 .",
    "however , this relation was known before we give the exact value of this @xmath114 which depends on the type of fermions , namely whether they are dirac or majorana spinors . in majorana case",
    "the central density can not be as high as in dirac case at same total mass .",
    "one can conclude from this that the value of this @xmath114 is higher in majorana case than in dirac case .",
    "it is an upper or absolute masslimit of such objects .",
    "we calculated the lower limit of the limit mass used the recent upper bound on annihilation cross section of dark matter particles .",
    "we could see that this limit is not strict but we can not state more on the base of the recent knowledge .",
    "further investigations are needed to answer the question what is the probability that such objects gather mass above the mass limit and undergo gravitational collapse or how much dark matter they could `` burn '' if they could not collapse .    00",
