    "columnar structures are ubiquitous throughout biology : examples range from viruses , flagella , microtubules , microfillaments , as well as certain rod shaped bacteria @xcite .",
    "however , they are also increasingly recognised in the physical sciences , particularly in nano - physics @xcite in the form of nanotubes and nanowires .",
    "other notable examples include the helical self - assembly of dusty plasmas @xcite , asymmetric colloidal dumbbells @xcite and particles trapped in channels @xcite .",
    "more recently such columnar arrangements have also been found as components of exotic crystal structures @xcite .    ; and , ( b ) a related line - slip structure @xmath0 . the gaps in ( b ) correspond to a loss of contact compared to ( a ) - the loss of contacts can also be seen clearly in the skeleton diagrams . ]",
    "columnar structures arise in their most elementary form when we seek the densest packing of hard spheres inside ( or on the surface ) of a circular cylinder @xcite .",
    "a wide range of structures have been identified and tabulated @xcite , depending on the ratio of cylinder diameter @xmath1 to sphere diameter @xmath2 .",
    "for each of a set of discrete values of @xmath3 , a uniform structure is found , and may be labelled with the traditional phyllotactic indices @xmath4 - see @xcite . between these values ,",
    "the structure is best accommodated by the introduction of a _ line slip _ , which shears two adjacent spirals with a loss of contacts , as shown in fig ( [ bubblespheres ] ) .",
    "these features were first identified by pickett _ et .",
    "@xcite , but not termed `` line slip '' .    we have become accustomed to thinking of line slips as being a property of _ hard _ spheres , and therefore of limited relevance to real physical systems .",
    "that point of view is reconsidered here : we experimentally demonstrate the existence of line - slip arrangements in foams with high liquid fraction ( see section [ sec : experiment ] ) .",
    "these observations constitute the first conclusive experimental evidence of such structures ( discounting the trivial case of packing ball - bearings in tubes @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , our experiments with foams demonstrate that line - slip structures can be stable in _ soft _ systems , a hitherto unexpected outcome .",
    "the results presented below improve on our previous attempts with small bubbles in capillaries under gravity , which proved difficult and in which line slips were not clearly seen @xcite .    our work is stimulated in part by the observation of line slips ( albeit rather indistinctly ) in some simulations , which use points interacting by ( the relatively complex ) lennard - jones type potentials @xcite . here",
    "we numerically investigate the stability of structures formed by soft ( elastic ) repelling spheres in cylindrical channels subject to an applied pressure .",
    "it has often been noted that the attractive tail of a pair potential acts rather like an applied pressure , so our simple model should have some generality in qualitative terms and could be compared fruitfully with these earlier simulations .",
    "our approach enables us to partially map out a rich phase diagram , consisting of a sequence of continuous and discontinuous transitions between uniform structures and line - slip arrangements .",
    "we show that in such soft systems line slips gradually vanish with an increasing pressure , while at high pressures only uniform structures remain stable . while it may seem obvious that line slips must disappear at higher pressures , the true scenario is complex , as we shall see .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe our numerical model and present the computed phase diagram .",
    "this is compared with our experimental results in section iii ( for further experimental details see the appendix ) .",
    "the discussion of these results is in section iv , followed by a brief concluding paragraph in section v.",
    "and dimensionless pressures @xmath5 .",
    "seven different structures are in the plotted range . with",
    "increasing pressure the widths of the line slips decrease and end in triple points .",
    "discontinuous transitions are displayed as solid black lines and continuous transitions are represented as dashed lines .",
    "the diamond symbols at @xmath6 correspond to the hard sphere symmetric structures @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite . accounting for the possible metastability",
    "( see below ) of the observed structure , a rough estimate of the experimentally observed line - slip structure is indicated by the ellipse on this phase diagram .",

    "we adopt an elementary approach that has proved useful for the description of foams and emulsions @xcite .",
    "it consists of spheres of diameter @xmath2 , whose overlap @xmath20 leads to an increase in energy according to @xmath21 here the overlap between two spheres @xmath22 and @xmath23 is defined as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the centers of two contacting spheres in cylindrical polar coordinates . a similar harmonic energy term @xmath27 accounts for the overlap between the @xmath22th sphere and the cylindrical boundary .",
    "the spring constant @xmath28 determines here the softness of the spheres .",
    "we conduct simulations using a simulation cell of length @xmath29 and volume @xmath30 . on both ends of the simulation cell",
    "we impose _ twisted _ periodic boundary conditions ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "stable structures are found by minimizing the enthalpy @xmath31 for a system of @xmath32 soft spheres in the unit cell , where @xmath33 is the internal energy due to overlaps as described before and @xmath34 the pressure .",
    "the natural units of this simulation are the spring constant @xmath28 and the sphere diameter @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , enthalpy and pressure have to be rescaled accordingly to obtain non - dimensional quantities . in the following",
    "we will use the dimensionless enthalpy @xmath35 and dimensionless pressure @xmath36 .    a part of the resulting phase diagram is shown in fig [ phasediagram ] , where for a given value of the diameter ratio @xmath3 and pressure @xmath37 the enthalpy is minimised by varying the sphere centres , as well as the twist angle and the volume of the simulation cell .",
    "this is done for several values of @xmath32 and the structure with the lowest enthalpy is chosen .    for low pressures",
    "the minimization was performed with a very general search algorithm ( similar to that used previously for the densest packing of hard spheres @xcite ) .",
    "we found that the results from these preliminary simulations could be used as initial guesses for a much simpler code ( based on conjugate gradient techniques ) to map out the higher pressure regions of the phase diagram .",
    "starting with an initial structure ( with @xmath38 ) we steadily increased the pressure and minimized enthalpy .",
    "as a further check we also ran the procedure in the orthogonal direction - i.e. we start with a seed structure with a high value of @xmath3 , keep the pressure constant while reducing @xmath3 in discrete steps and minimize the enthalpy at each step . in either case the structure with the lowest enthalpy for a given value of @xmath39 and @xmath37 is given in the phase diagram .",
    "we plot the phase diagram for the range @xmath40 and pressures below @xmath41 , as shown in fig [ phasediagram ] . along the horizontal axis ( i.e. @xmath42 )",
    "the red diamonds indicate the symmetric hard sphere structures @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "intermediate between them are the associated line - slip arrangements ( see also table [ exp : vf_table ] ) .",
    "the general trend is that increasing the pressure gradually eliminates the line slips which end up in a triple point and are forced into uniform structures .",
    "this transformation equates to a @xmath43 compression of the hard sphere packings , in the range shown .",
    "we now discuss the features of the phase diagram in detail .",
    "continuous transitions , where the structure changes gradually due to the loss or gain of a contact , are shown in fig [ phasediagram ] as dashed lines .",
    "discontinuous transitions , where the structure changes abruptly into another , are indicated with a solid line .",
    "transitions between uniform structures and a corresponding line slip are continuous .",
    "this is echoed by the sequence of hard sphere packings ( i.e. the structures along the horizontal axis ) as listed in table [ exp : vf_table ] .",
    "an explanation for the connections between a symmetric structures and a line slip for the hard sphere packing can be found in fig 10 and 12 of @xcite .     as @xmath39 is varied at a constant pressure @xmath44 .",
    "the plot shows a horizontal cut through the phase diagram of fig [ phasediagram ] .",
    "bottom : compression ratio @xmath45 of the soft packings as a function of the diameter ratio @xmath39 .",
    "only the transition from @xmath7 to @xmath46 is continuous and does not involve a change in the slope of @xmath47 at the phase boundary . ]     as @xmath37 is varied at a constant @xmath48 .",
    "the plot shows a vertical cut through the phase diagram of fig [ phasediagram ] .",
    "bottom : compression ratio @xmath45 of the soft packings as a function of the applied pressure .",
    "all the transitions shown are discontinuous , however for the enthalpy the change in the slope at the phase boundaries can only be detected by numerically computing the derivative . ]    a typical example of a discontinuous transition is given by the solid line separating the @xmath49 and @xmath0 line - slip regions .",
    "we find in the case of soft spheres that with increasing pressure the @xmath0 line slip is first to disappear at a triple point followed by the @xmath49 line slip at a slightly higher pressure . at still higher pressures",
    "only the @xmath8 and @xmath9 uniform structures remain stable , separated by a discontinuous phase transition .    on first glance on our phase diagram",
    ", the case @xmath50 seems to be exceptional , in that only a single line slip , the @xmath0 line slip , is visible . from table [ exp : vf_table ] we would also have expected to see two line slips separating the uniform structures ( as in the previous case ) .",
    "however , the line - slip structure of the @xmath11 exists only in the narrow range @xmath51 for the hard spheres ( see table [ exp : vf_table ] ) and is not resolved in fig [ phasediagram ] .",
    "the distinction between continuous and discontinuous transitions can be illustrated directly via the enthalpy @xmath52 .",
    "an example of @xmath52 in terms of @xmath39 at constant pressure @xmath44 is given in fig [ enthalpydd ] .",
    "continuous transitions , such as @xmath53 uniform ( indicated in green ) to @xmath0 line slip ( indicated in light green ) , are not apparent in the variation of @xmath52 .",
    "however , discontinuous transitions such as the @xmath0 line slip to @xmath54 uniform ( yellow ) show a change in slope of @xmath52 at the transition .    also shown for comparison in fig [ enthalpydd ] is the compression of the packing subject to the applied pressure .",
    "we define the compression as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the volume of the unit cell of the soft sphere packing ( for the chosen @xmath37 and @xmath39 ) and @xmath57 is the volume of the corresponding hard sphere structure . in the case of uniform structures",
    "the volume of the unit cell in the hard sphere case has a unique value @xcite .",
    "however , for the line - slip structures this is not the case ( since the length of the unit cell depends on @xmath3 ) and instead we compare against the smallest volume of the unit cell for a given hard sphere arrangement of this type @xcite .",
    "it is illustrative to also consider the orthogonal trajectory , i.e. variation in the enthalpy @xmath52 in terms of @xmath37 at constant diameter ratio . as an example of this",
    "we show in fig [ enthalpyp ] a vertical cut through fig [ phasediagram ] , where we hold the diameter ratio at a constant @xmath48 and vary the pressure .",
    "the corresponding compression ratio is also shown .",
    "the trajectory passes through a transition from @xmath0 to @xmath8 and then from @xmath8 to @xmath9 - both of these are discontinuous transitions ; while the change in the slope can not be determined by inspection from fig [ enthalpyp ] it nevertheless can be clearly observed by taking the derivative of @xmath52 with respect to @xmath37 along the trajectory .    in due course we shall use the methods developed here to investigate the phase diagram for higher @xmath3 up to @xmath58 , beyond which the nature of the hard sphere packings changes @xcite , and to higher pressure .",
    "we now describe our experimental procedure and results ( for further details of the set - up see the appendix ) . for a convenient experimental counterpart ,",
    "we choose to observe structures of columns of bubbles under _ forced drainage _ that is , a steady input of liquid from above @xcite . in the past",
    "this has been extensively studied for columns of bulk foam where @xmath39 was very large .",
    "it was found that this results in convective instabilities for flow rates that gave rise to higher liquid fractions , confining experiments on static foam structures to relatively dry foam @xcite .",
    "the corresponding theory was therefore developed using approximations appropriate in the dry limit , that is , in terms of liquid flow in a network of narrow plateau borders .",
    "the present work leads us to consider columns of wet foams , that is , with the drainage rate high enough to produce near - spherical bubbles .",
    "we find no such instability in the case of the confined columnar structures of large bubbles considered here ; hence the wet limit can be reached at a certain flow rate . below that point ,",
    "the liquid fraction can be varied , producing ordered columnar structures closely analogous to those described above .    for the experimental set - up @xcite ,",
    "monodisperse bubbles are produced by blowing air through a needle into a commercial surfactant fairy liquid .",
    "the surfactant solution contains 50% of glycerol in mass to increase the viscosity , smooth the transition between structures and to allow us observe more easily unstable bubble arrangements .",
    "tuning the gas flow rate ( @xmath59 ) allows us to produce monodisperse bubbles of controlled size ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "when released into a vertical cylinder , the bubbles are observed to self - organise into ordered structures ( we used a glass tube for which the diameter is @xmath61 and the length is @xmath62 ) .",
    "the resulting foam column is put under forced drainage by feeding it with surfactant solution from the top ( liquid flow rate @xmath63 up to @xmath64 ) .",
    "we estimate the capillary pressure for the bubbles to be of the order of approximately @xmath65 , which is an order of magnitude smaller than the hydrostatic pressure - thus the bubbles are in the regime whereby they can easily be deformed and the foam can be treated as a packing of relatively soft objects - see appendix .",
    "uniform structure occurring at a relatively low flow rate .",
    "right : bubbles adopt the @xmath66 line - slip structure at a relatively high flow rate .",
    "it is similar to the line - slip structure of fig ( [ bubblespheres]b ) .",
    "the coloring highlights the two interlocked spirals of the ( 3,2,1 ) and @xmath66 structures .",
    "the ellipse marked on fig [ phasediagram ] corresponds roughly to its estimated position on the phase diagram . ]",
    "we show in fig [ bubblespheresx ] an example of the observation of the @xmath0 line - slip structure in accord with expectations based on the soft sphere model , described above .",
    "note that the bubbles are distorted into smooth ellipsoids by the flow .",
    "the extent of the loss of contact in the observed line - slip structure is roughly equal to that of the simulated structure at the position marked with an ellipse in the phase diagram .",
    "this is also consistent with our estimates of equivalent pressure @xmath37 and equivalent @xmath39 , where the equivalent pressure is determined from the local packing fraction .    while the boundaries plotted in fig 2 demarcate the borders between the lowest enthalpy structures , preliminary simulations indicate that the such structures can be metastable .",
    "hence we indicate by an ellipse on fig [ phasediagram ] the possible range over which the experimentally observed structure can exist ( where we also have accounted for possible sources of experimental error ) .",
    "we are currently in the process of examining the metastability of soft sphere columnar structures by performing further experiments and simulations    the shape distortion due to liquid flow , together with that due to the forces between bubbles , and hence the equilibrium structure itself , will be analysed in a subsequent paper , together with a wide range of observations .",
    "those forces are only very crudely modelled in the present paper .",
    "the necessary theory of drainage of stable structures of wet foam has not previously been formulated .",
    "considering that our original study of hard - sphere arrangements in a cylinder was motivated as a packing problem @xcite , it may have seemed plausible that the structures described above would only be of importance close to the incompressible athermal limit .",
    "recently , however , these original findings have been found to be relevant in the _ self - assembly _ of hard spheres in cylindrical channels @xcite .",
    "remarkably , it is found that at finite temperature and pressure both uniform and line - slip arrangements can be observed : a steadily increasing pressure can induce transitions between structures , while at a high compression rate some arrangements are found to be dynamically inaccessible @xcite , these results are illustrated in terms of a phase diagram that bears a resemblance to the results presented here .",
    "this is due to the fact that the thermally agitated hard spheres have an effective radius that scales with the mean free path , this leads to an effective interaction reminiscent of a soft potential .",
    "these results only indirectly hint at the manner in which the hard sphere results are modified in the presence of soft interactions .",
    "the present results have the advantage of directly addressing the stability of line - slip arrangements in softly interacting systems .",
    "these results may also be fruitfully compared with previous studies employing the lennard - jones potential , where both uniform structures and line - slip arrangements are observed @xcite . on the other hand , in the case of very soft potentials , such as the yukawa interaction , line - slips have not been either predicted to exist @xcite or indeed observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "determining the robustness of the phase diagram presented in fig [ phasediagram ] as a function of the hardness / softness of the interaction potential remains an open question    another related study is that of rivier and boltenhagen @xcite who observed structural transitions in cylindrical _ dry _ foam under pressure , well outside of the range of our investigation .",
    "in conclusion , questioning the relevance of hard - sphere properties to physical systems , consisting of _ soft _ spheres has led us into a new territory , not previously explored .",
    "we have shown that line - slip arrangements are a feature of soft systems ( even in the absence of thermal agitation ) , thus extending their usefulness to encompass a range of commonly encountered substances including dusty plasmas , foams , emulsions and colloids .",
    "it is of direct relevance to some physical systems ( foams , emulsions ) and offers qualitative interpretation in others .",
    "it extends into another dimension ( that of pressure ) the elaborate table of hard - sphere structures previously found .",

    "here we briefly discuss the experimental set - up used to produce the columnar arrangement of bubbles .",
    "we begin by describing a method for generating monodisperse foams in a column .",
    "we then discuss how the liquid ( or packing ) fraction and its effect on the morphology of the foam can be controlled .",
    "as shown in fig ( [ setup]a ) , a steady stream of monodisperse bubbles is produced by blowing air through a needle dipped in a surfactant solution . tuning the gas flow rate ( @xmath59 ) allows us to produce monodisperse bubbles for a range of diameters .",
    "the bubbles are collected in a cylindrical tube , where they form a columnar foam .",
    "the bubbles are approximately of diameter @xmath67 with a standard deviation of @xmath68 .",
    "the bubble diameter is determined by squeezing a small amount of foam between two horizontal , parallel plates , separated by a controlled gap to obtain a monolayer of bubbles and image analysis of the top view .    for a bubble in our experiments",
    "the capillary pressure is @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the surface tension and @xmath71 is the radius of the bubble . the hydrostatic pressure , @xmath72 for a given bubble depends on the height @xmath73 of the bubble in the column , as measured from the liquid / air interface ( see fig ( [ setup]b ) , as well as the density of the liquid @xmath74 and gravity @xmath75 . by balancing @xmath76 with @xmath77 ,",
    "@xmath73 can be determined to @xmath78 .",
    "the column used for experiments is approximately @xmath62 .",
    "thus , we can safely assume that the hydrostatic pressure dominates in the experiments and the foam can be regarded as _ soft _ packing of bubbles .",
    "the resulting foam column is put under forced drainage by feeding it with surfactant solution from the top with a liquid flow rate @xmath63 up to @xmath79 . as shown in fig ( [ setup]b ) ,",

    "the local packing fraction ( as defined in the appendix ) from the experiment is directly comparable to the packing fraction @xmath86 in the simulation , which depends on @xmath37 .",
