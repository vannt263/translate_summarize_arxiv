    "turbulence is one of the most important topics in modern physics .",
    "turbulence in classical fluids has been studied for a long time @xcite , but turbulence is also observed in diverse fields such as low - temperature physics , plasma physics , and astronomy , @xmath0 .",
    "kolmogorov studied turbulence in classical fluids in 1941 @xcite and significantly advanced the study of turbulence .",
    "he found that the kinetic energy spectrum obeyed a @xmath2 power law , which became known as the kolmogorov @xmath2 power law .",
    "several methods have been used for generating turbulence in classical fluids .",
    "reynolds performed a famous experiment in 1883 in which he created turbulence by using flow through a circular pipe .",
    "another method uses hydrodynamic instabilities , which have been investigated for a long time .",
    "there are many kinds of instabilities such as kelvin ",
    "helmholtz ( kh ) and rayleigh  taylor ( rt ) instabilities @xcite which can lead to turbulence .",
    "hydrodynamic instability has recently been studied in atomic bose  einstein condensates ( becs ) .",
    "atomic becs exhibit different dynamics from classical fluids because they are quantum fluids .",
    "quantized vortices occur in becs ; these vortices are nucleated through the hydrodynamic instability .",
    "kh and rt instabilities have been studied in two - component atomic becs . for kh instability ,",
    "quantized vortices nucleate at the boundary layer between the two components @xcite , whereas rt instability generates the shape of mushroom in the condensate winded by the quantized vortex ring @xcite .",
    "moreover , counterflow instability in two - component atomic becs results in vortices that nucleate by the collapse of solitons @xcite .",
    "thus , hydrodynamic instability has been extensively investigated in two - component atomic becs .    unlike two - component atomic becs , spinor becs have spin degrees of freedom and exhibit phenomena characteristic of spin .",
    "collisions of spin-1 spinor becs have been investigated numerically and show different results from one- and two - component becs @xcite . the hydrodynamic equation for spinor becs",
    "has recently been studied @xcite .",
    "however , hydrodynamic instability in spinor becs has been investigated less than in two - component becs .",
    "we expect that hydrodynamic instability in spinor becs will exhibit unique behavior due to their spin degrees of freedom and form turbulent states in which the spin density vector has different directions .",
    "quantum turbulence has been investigated for a long time in superfluid @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite , being currently studied in atomic becs too @xcite .",
    "numerical studies predict that the kolmogorov @xmath2 power law , which was first observed in classical fluids , also holds in atomic becs @xcite .",
    "turbulence in two - component becs has been investigated @xcite .",
    "we expect that the turbulent state in a spin-1 spinor bec will exhibit properties characteristic of the spin degrees of freedom , which one- and two - component becs do not show .",
    "this is one of the major themes of this paper .    in this paper , we focus on counterflow instability in spin-1 spinor becs in a homogeneous two - dimensional system .",
    "there are three reasons for studying the instability in this system .",
    "the first reason is that the dynamics of spin-1 spinor becs induced by counterflow exhibit characteristic behaviors .",
    "dynamics peculiar to counterflow have been observed in two - component becs @xcite . however , there are distinct differences between two - component becs and spinor becs .",
    "a spinor bec has spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the number of particles of each component is conserved in a two - component bec , whereas it is not conserved in a spinor bec because of the spin - dependent interaction .",
    "therefore , we expect that a spin-1 spinor bec will exhibit dynamics characteristic of not only the counterflow but also the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the second reason for studying counterflow instability in spin-1 spinor becs is that counterflow instability can generate turbulence in spin-1 spinor becs .",
    "as stated above , one aim of this study is to investigate the behavior of turbulence in spin-1 spinor becs .",
    "the third reason is that counterflow in two - components becs has been experimentally investigated @xcite .",
    "we expect that it may be possible to experimentally study counterflow of spin-1 spinor becs . hence , we study the counterflow instability of spin-1 spinor becs using the gross  pitaevskii ( gp ) equation and the bogoliubov  de gennes ( bdg ) equation .",
    "we consider counterflow between the @xmath5 and @xmath6 components , where @xmath7 is the magnetic quantum number .",
    "our main purposes are to investigate phenomena characteristic of the spin degrees of freedom induced by the counterflow instability and the properties of a turbulent state in spin-1 spinor becs . for the instability",
    ", we investigate the pattern of the particle number density and the time dependence of the magnitude of the spin density vector , @xmath0 . for the turbulence of a spin-1 spinor bec , we focus on statistical quantities such as the probability density function ( pdf ) of the magnitude of the spin density vector and the spectrum of the spin - dependent interaction energy .",
    "the results obtained reveal that the behaviors of the instability and the turbulent state induced by the counterflow depend greatly on the sign of the spin - dependent interaction .",
    "we calculate the dispersion relation obtained from the bdg equation , the pdf of the magnitude of the spin density vector and the spectrum of the spin - dependent interaction energy ; these quantities exhibit different behaviors depending on whether the spin - dependent interaction is ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic . as for the spectrum of the spin - dependent interaction energy , the @xmath1 power law is clearly found in the ferromagnetic case , but not in the antiferromagnetic case .",
    "the @xmath1 power law can be understood by the scaling analysis of the time development equation of the spin density vector .",

    "the dynamics induced by the counterflow in the spin-1 spinor bec was investigated by performing analytical calculations using the bdg equation and numerical calculations using the gp equation .",
    "we obtain the dispersion relations of eqs . ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) from the bdg equation ; these relations show the dynamical instability .",
    "the dispersion relations depend on the spin - dependent interaction , so that @xmath216 $ ] and @xmath217 $ ] for the antiferromagnetic case differ from those for the ferromagnetic case ( figs . 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the numerical calculations reveal that , in the early stages of the instability , the dynamics can be understood in terms of the dispersion relations . the stripe width of the density modulation in fig .",
    "5(a ) and 9(a ) is approximately equal to the most unstable wavelength obtained by the dispersion relations .",
    "in addition , the isotropy and anisotropy of the density modulation in figs .",
    "3(b ) and 5(a ) can be explained in terms of the dispersion relations .",
    "the distinct difference between the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cases appears in the magnitude of the spin density vector , as shown in figs .",
    "3 @xmath218 10 .",
    "this is very important for the spectrum of the spin - dependent interaction energy in the turbulence , as pointed out in sec .",
    "v. these results reveal dynamics peculiar to the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "we studied the turbulence generated by the counterflow in spin-1 spinor becs by performing numerical calculations using the gp equation and scaling analysis . in the ferromagnetic case",
    ", the spectrum of the spin - dependent interaction energy obeys the @xmath1 power law ( fig .",
    "the power exponent @xmath1 is obtained by the scaling analysis of eq .",
    "( 31 ) when we make the following three assumptions : the wave functions @xmath219 are approximately expressed by eq .",
    "( 26 ) , eq .",
    "( 31 ) are invariant under the scale transformation , and the flux of the spin - dependent interaction energy is independent of the wave number .    on the other hand , for the antiferromagnetic case , the spectrum does not exhibit the @xmath1 power law .",
    "this is probably attributable to the breakdown of the validity of eq .",
    "( 26 ) . in this case ,",
    "the pdf of the magnitude of the spin density vector ( fig .",
    "16 ) differs from that for the ferromagnetic case ( fig .",
    "12 ) , so that such scaling analysis used for the ferromagnetic case is not applicable .",
    "however , in the narrow range of the wave number , the spectrum in fig .",
    "15 may show a power law , which can not be estimated by the scaling analysis .",
    "these results are characteristic of the spin degrees of freedom and are thus not exhibited by turbulence in one - component becs and classical fluids .",
