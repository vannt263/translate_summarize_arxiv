    "previous results of the epos and orange collaborations at the unilac accelerator of gsi have revealed unexpected lines in the sum - energy spectra obtained in heavy - ion collisions at bombarding energies near the coulomb barrier  @xcite .",
    "no viable explanation could be found for these experimental results . at the beginning it was tempting to interpret these lines as being due to the decay of a previously unknown neutral particle with a mass around 1.8 mev / c@xmath2 , a conjecture which was definitely ruled out by subsequent conclusive bhabha - scattering experiments  @xcite . after this time",
    "it was become clear that internal pair conversion ( ipc ) from excited nuclear transitions , which can in principle lead to narrow lines in the sum - energy spectra , was less well understood than previously assumed , such that some of reported weak lines might be due to this process .",
    "the motivation of the present work was indeed a search for discrete ipc transitions , excited in heavy - ion collisions at energies close to the coulomb barrier , as possible candidates for previously observed weak -sum - energy lines with cross sections of the order of a few @xmath3b for the system and some tenth of @xmath3b for @xmath4u + @xmath5pb collisions  @xcite . particularly for the last system , two sum - energy lines at ( 575 @xmath6 6 ) kev and at ( 787 @xmath6 8) kev",
    "have been observed at a beam energy of 5.9 mev / u  @xcite .",
    "the 787 kev line appeared in both quasielastic central ( r@xmath7 20 fm ) and rather peripheral ( r@xmath8 2026 fm ) collisions , whereas the 575 kev line occurred only in coincidence with central collisions .",
    "both lines were seen without a doppler - shift correction and only in the opening - angle region @xmath9= @xmath10 , for which doppler broadening is expected to be small for similar energies of both leptons .    in order to test the response and sensitivity of our experimental setup to ipc pairs from a moving emitter we investigated a known transition in @xmath11pb populated via coulomb excitation , using a @xmath4u beam and a @xmath11pb target . on the other hand ,",
    "since the number of combined nuclear charge ( z@xmath12174 ) is the same for the collision systems and , the lines seen previously in the last system  @xcite should also appear in the present experiment , if their origin is closely connected with the strong electromagnetic fields available in the collision .",
    "here we report the first results from these improved investigations , being performed at the unilac accelerator of gsi .",
    "a dedicated doppler - shift technique is exploited at the double - orange setup  @xcite , which allows to reveal narrow lines in the measured sum - energy and @xmath0-ray spectra  @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned here that , from their experimental results reported most recently , the apex collaboration  @xcite at anl and the epos ii  @xcite and orange  @xcite collaborations at gsi have all failed to find evidence for the previously reported sum - energy lines .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "1 , leptons emitted from a target placed between two toroidal magnetic field spectrometers with their axis parallel to the beam direction were momentum analyzed by the toroidal magnetic field and detected with two arrays of high - resolution si detectors .",
    "the toroidal @xmath13)-field is generated by 60 iron - free coils .",
    "electrons with emission angles @xmath14 and positrons with @xmath15 relative to the beam axis are accepted by the spectrometers .",
    "the lepton detectors consist each of 72 si pin diodes ( chips ) of trapezoidal shape ( base : 24 mm , top : 16 mm , height : 16 mm , thickness : 1 mm ) arranged in a pagoda - like form  @xcite .",
    "each chip is subdivided into three segments .",
    "a pagoda roof consists of six pin diodes , i.e. 18 segments .",
    "one detector array is composed of 12 such roofs .",
    "thus , we get a position sensitive detector with 216 segments read out in a matrix mode . at a given field setting only particles with a certain sign of charge are focused onto the corresponding detector arrays .",
    "thus , a very clean separation of electrons and positrons is achieved . for further lepton identification the lepton",
    "energy and momentum is determined simultaneously .",
    "the deposited energy is measured by the pin diodes , and the lepton momentum is calculated from the deflection and the field setting .",
    "only events for which the energy - momentum relation is fulfilled are accepted , with the result that the remaining e@xmath16 misidentification is small and can be determined reliably ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the spectrometer accepts lepton pairs with opening angles , @xmath17 , from 40@xmath18 to @xmath19 in the laboratory system .",
    "this range can be subdivided into 10 bins of width @xmath20 . for reconstruction of the reaction kinematics",
    "both scattered heavy ions are detected by 19 parallel plate avalanche counters ( ppacs ) which accept ions scattered under polar angles of @xmath21 and @xmath22 with a resolution of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the azimuthal - angle resolution of all ( ion and lepton ) detectors is @xmath25 .",
    "+ for the detection of @xmath0 rays we used a high resolution 70%-ge(i ) detector placed at @xmath26 relative to the beam axis at a distance of 40 cm from the target .",
    "an ionization chamber installed at @xmath27 measures the energy of scattered particles and thus controls the effective target thickness .",
    "it is also used for current normalization .",
    "extensive measurements carried out with radioactive @xmath28sr and @xmath29bi sources proved that our setup is capable of detecting ipc pairs and of determining their opening - angle distribution from an emitter at rest  @xcite .",
    "the measured fwhm of these sum - energy lines is @xmath3016 kev , consistent with the sum - energy resolution of the lepton detectors .",
    "data were taken for the collision system @xmath4u + @xmath11pb using @xmath4u beams and 800 @xmath3g / cm@xmath2 thick @xmath11pb targets mounted on a rotating target wheel . the projectile energy ( 5.93 mev / u ) is slightly below the coulomb barrier ( 6.06 mev / u ) .",
    "the @xmath32-level at 2.65 mev in @xmath11pb is populated via coulomb excitation and deexcites for the most part into the lower lying @xmath33-level with a @xmath0-transition energy of  @xcite .",
    "following an event - by - event doppler - shift correction to the pb - like recoiling ion , a pronounced @xmath0 line with a total excitation cross section of @xmath34 appears at ( 1844 @xmath6 1 ) kev in the measured energy spectrum ( fig.2a ) .",
    "the excitation probability , p@xmath35(r@xmath1 ) , was determined as a function of distance of closest approach , r@xmath1 , by normalizing the @xmath0 yield in certain r@xmath1 intervals with the corresponding number of elastically scattered ions . at large r@xmath1 values",
    ", p@xmath35 shows an exponential decrease , whereas at small r@xmath1 values p@xmath35 is cut off abruptly at r@xmath36 17 fm , where the nuclei come into contact .",
    "such a behaviour is typical for coulomb excitation ( fig .",
    "the results are in accordance with measurements of the epos collaboration who investigated the same collision system at a bombarding energy of 5.82 mev / u and @xmath30400 @xmath3g / cm@xmath2 thick targets .",
    "they report recently a measured cross section of @xmath34 ( 44 @xmath6 7 ) mb  @xcite .    from the 1844 kev transition we expect ipc pairs with a sum energy of multiplying the measured @xmath0",
    "cross section with the theoretically predicted ipc coefficient of @xmath37 , for an electromagnetic transition with multipolarity e1 , z=82 and energy 1850 kev  @xcite , we expect a total cross section for ipc of @xmath38(22 @xmath6 2 ) @xmath3b . in order to optimize the peak - to - continuum ratio in the e@xmath16e@xmath39-sum - energy spectra",
    ", we eliminated very positive energy differences @xmath40e = e@xmath41 e@xmath42 175 kev and accepted only rather peripheral collisions with r@xmath43 23 fm .",
    "thus , we could reduce the contribution of the continuum pairs produced by the large time changing coulomb field . the event - by - event doppler - shift corrected sum - energy spectrum obtained under these conditions is shown in fig .",
    "the spectrum is integrated over the whole range of lepton opening angles covered experimentally .",
    "as shown , the continuous part of the measured spectrum is well reproduced by a reference distribution ( smooth solid curve ) , being gained by an event - mixing procedure .    from the ipc cross section quoted above , a total of about 35 ipc pairs",
    "is then expected in the spectrum shown in fig .",
    "2c , using an ipc detection efficiency of @xmath44 ( 1.6 @xmath6 0.2 ) @xmath45 . they should result in a line at an energy of @xmath30820 kev with a fwhm of @xmath30 20 kev , superimposed on the continuum .",
    "the ipc detection efficiency has been obtained by a monte carlo simulation , which assumes isotropically emitted e@xmath16e@xmath39 pairs and theoretically - calculated lepton energy distributions for z @xmath46 82 and e1 multipolarity  @xcite .",
    "the width of the doppler - shift corrected line depends on the emitter velocity and on the angular resolution of the detectors .",
    "for the case of a rather slow emitter ( i.e. @xmath470.05c ) , we expect line widths near the limit given by the detector sum - energy resolution , i.e. fwhm @xmath30 16 kev  @xcite . as can be seen in fig .",
    "2c , at an energy of ( 815 @xmath6 10 ) kev an excess of ( 34 @xmath6 12 ) counts is observed , in accordance with our estimate of 35 counts .",
    "we found an additional line in the @xmath0 spectra , when corrected on the pb - like scattered ion , at an energy of ( 1770 @xmath6 1 ) kev .",
    "this line appears only in central collisions with r@xmath7 20 fm ( fig.3.a ) . in the r@xmath1 parameter range selected",
    "( 17 fm @xmath48 r@xmath1 @xmath48 20 fm ) , the @xmath0 lines at 1770 kev and at 1844 kev have comparable intensities .",
    "the excitation probability for the 1770 kev line as a function of r@xmath1 , is shown in fig .",
    "it peaks within a narrow r@xmath1 interval , typical for transfer reactions , for which the transfer probability is expected to become large when the nuclei come into contact .",
    "this also means that the excitation function should exhibit a rather narrow structure at energies close to the coulomb barrier with a width of about 0.3 mev / u .",
    "similar narrow structures in the r@xmath1 dependence were observed for a two - neutron transfer reaction , leading to the known 3.71 mev @xmath49 level in @xmath5pb  @xcite .",
    "the line at 1770 kev is assigned to a known m1 transition in @xmath29pb from the @xmath50 ( 2.34 mev ) to @xmath51 ( 0.57 mev ) state  @xcite , populated by neutron transfer from @xmath4u to @xmath11pb , with a total cross section of @xmath34(1.1 @xmath6 0.3 ) mb .",
    "the corresponding ipc production cross section is expected to be @xmath38(0.3 @xmath6 0.1 ) @xmath3b with @xmath52  @xcite , which should lead to a weak -sum - energy line at @xmath30750 kev with a fwhm of @xmath30 40 kev , and an intensity of about 10 counts .",
    "this is also weakly indicated in the corresponding doppler - shift corrected sum - energy spectrum , shown in .",
    "3c , although one can not distinguish its appearance from the expected statistical fluctuations , which are of the same order .",
    "the situation is similar for the line at @xmath30820 kev , which is expected to have comparable intensity .",
    "note that the 1770 kev @xmath0 line was not observed by the epos collaboration , who investigated the same collision system at a beam energy of 5.82 mev / u and a @xmath30 400 @xmath3g / cm@xmath2 thick @xmath11pb target  @xcite .",
    "this may also be taken as an indication for a strong beam energy dependence of transfer reactions at the coulomb barrier of heavy collision systems .",
    "the results discussed in the previous section show that ipc processes after coulomb excitation appear with typical cross sections of some @xmath3b in the e@xmath16e@xmath39sum - energy spectra .",
    "corresponding @xmath0 lines resulting from coulomb excitation have cross sections of some 10 mb .",
    "this is expected for ipc coefficients of the order of @xmath53 .",
    "the observed cross sections of the @xmath0 lines , following nucleon transfer , show a peaked r@xmath1 dependence and are in the order of 1 mb .",
    "they suggest corresponding e@xmath16e@xmath39line cross sections of some 0.1 @xmath3b , in agreement with the measurement .",
    "previously reported e@xmath16e@xmath39sum - energy lines , showing partially the characteristics of ipc transitions in the ta - like nucleus  @xcite , reveal cross sections of a few @xmath3b . from this limit , @xmath0 transitions of at least 10 mb cross section are suggested . however , none of the corresponding doppler - shift corrected @xmath0-ray spectra exhibited lines with cross sections @xmath54 1 mb , thus excluding electromagnetic transitions with multipolarity @xmath55 0 in the ta - like nucleus as the source of the lines .",
    "however , transitions without a @xmath0 decay branch , namely @xmath56 transitions , can not be excluded by the @xmath0 measurements .    recently , a search for monopole transitions in collisions at a beam energy of 6.0 mev / u was conducted at gsi using conversion electron spectroscopy  @xcite . from these investigations , a limit of 0.3 mb for the production cross section of a k - conversion line in @xmath57ta at an energy around 1.7 mev is derived .",
    "this limit can be transformed into an upper limit of @xmath58 @xmath59 for the production of corresponding pairs , when an ipc - conversion - electron coefficient of @xmath60  @xcite for @xmath57ta at an energy of 1.8 mev is taken into account . in the case of our previously reported lines",
    "@xcite , this limit is not quite sensitive enough to exclude an e0 transition definitely .    in context with",
    "the 575 kev and 787 kev sum - energy lines , observed previously in @xmath4u + @xmath5pb collision at 5.9 mev / u  @xcite , one would expect @xmath0 lines at 1.595 mev and 1.807 mev energy with cross sections of about 1 mb , assuming the @xmath5pb - like nuclei as emitters .",
    "unfortunately , the corresponding @xmath0-ray spectra were taken at that time with a low - resolution nai detector  @xcite , which was not sensitive enough for detection of such weak @xmath0 lines .",
    "consequently , no exclusion of electromagnetic transitions of any multipolarity is possible at this stage for this collision system .    in summary",
    "we conclude that ipc pairs from discrete nuclear transitions of a moving emitter can be observed with production cross sections down to the tenth @xmath3b level in heavy collision systems , in which the continuous distributions due to uncorrelated emission and nuclear background are dominating .",
    "apart from the observed weak ipc lines , no other lines could be found in the measured sum - energy spectra of this collision system .",
    "the present sensitivity achieved is at the level of statistical fluctuations or weak sum - energy lines observed in previous experiments .",
