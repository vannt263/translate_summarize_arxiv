    "eversince david kazhdan introduced property ( t ) in @xcite , it has been a challenge to prove that particular groups have this property or not .",
    "moreover , it has become an intriguing task to provide explicit bounds ( in case of particular groups such as @xmath4 ) for the associated kazhdan constants or the spectral gap , see @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for general information on kazhdan s property ( t ) .    in @xcite , narutaka ozawa has found a new necessary and sufficient criterion of property ( t ) for discrete groups , using a sum - of - squares approach inspired by the solution to hilbert s 17th problem , and a systematic study of its generalizations to a non - commutative context , see for example @xcite .",
    "let @xmath5 be a group and @xmath6 be a symmetric finite generating set and define @xmath7 the group @xmath5 has property ( t ) if and only if @xmath2 has a spectral gap at zero , i.e. , if and only if there exists some @xmath8 , such that @xmath9 in every unitary representation of @xmath5 on a hilbert space .",
    "ozawa showed in @xcite that this happens if and only if there exists @xmath10 $ ] such that @xmath11 for some @xmath8 . whereas the sufficiency is obvious",
    ", the proof of necessity of this criterion involved some observations in the context of so - called non - commutative real algebraic geometry of the group ring associated with the group  inspired in part on previous work by the authors @xcite .",
    "even though sufficiency was easy to establish , ozawa s work has been an eye - opener and triggered the concrete attempt to find explicit certificates  that means solutions to equation  for groups well - known to have property ( t ) . in this short paper , we have achieved this goal for the group @xmath12 and its natural generating set consisting of elementary matrices .",
    "using matlab , yalmip , sedumi and finally mathematica , we could improve all previous bounds on the spectral gap by a factor of about @xmath13 . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the best previously known bound for the kazhdan constant was @xmath14 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 12.1.14 ) , and this leads to a spectral gap for unnormalized laplace operator of at least @xmath15  for example using the estimate from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 3 ) .    in our solution to equation",
    ", we have that @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and each @xmath18 a sum of at most @xmath19 monomials in the real group ring and supported on elements of length @xmath20 with respect to the generating set .",
    "even though the length of the elements in the support is rather low and it appears that we have been extremely lucky , it seems unlikely that this sum - of - squares representation ( and maybe any other ) could have been found without computer assistance .",
    "our result also shows that the spectral gap is significant in the sense that the resulting bounds on the mixing time of the product replacement algorithm for abelian groups ( see @xcite and the references therein ) is actually useful for practical purposes .",
    "any attempt like this for groups like @xmath21 and related groups has failed so far due to lack of computational power  and maybe our limited programming skills .",
    "anyhow , the challenge and the desire to understand _ why _ a group has property ( t ) and _ why _ the product replacement algorithm for general groups works so well ( see @xcite ) would remain untouched by any such computational result .",
    "let @xmath22 be a ( non - commutative ) @xmath23-algebra over @xmath24 and let @xmath25 be a finite dimensional subspace .",
    "checking whether some @xmath26 belongs to @xmath27 can be done with the so - called _ gram - matrix method_. fix a basis @xmath28 of @xmath29 .",
    "a matrix @xmath30 is called a _ gram matrix for @xmath31 _ , if @xmath32 holds .",
    "note that any @xmath33 admits a gram matrix , and in general different ones .",
    "indeed the set of all gram matrices for @xmath31 is an affine subspace of @xmath34 .",
    "the element @xmath31 is _ hermitian _",
    "( i.e. fulfills @xmath35 ) if and only if it admits a symmetric gram matrix .",
    "the crucial ( and straightforward ) observation is that @xmath36if and only if @xmath31 admits a _ positive semidefinite _ symmetric gram matrix . now",
    "this condition can be checked with semidefinite programming . indeed ,",
    "equation ( [ gram ] ) boils down to finitely many affine - linear conditions on the entries of @xmath37 , and looking for a positive semidefinite matrix fulfilling these conditions is the feasibility check of a semidefinite programm ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "there exist numerical software for such problems , in our case the matlab plugin yalmip @xcite , employing the sdp - solver sedumi @xcite . with these solvers we were able to find a suitable sums of squares representation for our problem .",
    "let us go into more details .",
    "we consider the group @xmath38 and its real group algebra @xmath39,$ ] which is a @xmath23-algebra via @xmath40 we use @xmath41 generators @xmath42 for @xmath5 , obtained from @xmath43 by closing up under transposing and taking inverses .",
    "we then form all products of length @xmath20 in these generators . after removing multiples , this results in @xmath44 group elements , including the identity matrix .",
    "we let @xmath29 be the linear span of these group elements in @xmath45 $ ] and take @xmath46 to be the natural basis .",
    "now let @xmath47 be the _",
    "unnormalized _ laplace operator , and set @xmath48 with @xmath49 we used the matlab plugin yalmip with sdp - solver sedumi to find a positive semidefinite matrix @xmath50 satisfying ( [ gram ] ) in the group algebra @xmath45 $ ] . from the numerical result",
    "@xmath37 we computed a square - root , rounded to rational entries , and multiplied with a common denominator @xmath51 .",
    "the resulting integer matrix is stored in the attached file `` rootofp.txt '' .    now certifying that the result is correct",
    "is done as follows ( and can be reproduced with the attached mathematica @xcite file `` sl3zcomment.nb '' ) .",
    "we take the matrix @xmath52 stored in `` rootofp.txt '' and change it slightly to make all rows sum to zero .",
    "we then compute @xmath53 .",
    "thus @xmath37 is a positive semidefinite matrix with rational entries , and the total sum over all entries equals zero . with @xmath28 as above we",
    "compute the sum of squares @xmath54 in the group algebra .",
    "since the sum over all entries of @xmath37 is zero , @xmath55 will lie in the augmentation ideal @xmath56:=\\left\\ { \\sum_g c_g g\\mid \\sum_g c_g=0\\right\\}\\subseteq \\r[\\gamma].\\ ] ] we next compare @xmath55 to @xmath57 the difference @xmath58 is hermitian and belongs again to the augmentation ideal @xmath59 $ ] . furthermore , each group element in the support of @xmath60 is a product of at most four of our generators @xmath61 , since each @xmath62 is a product of at most two of them .",
    "we compute @xmath63 . from lemma [ estimate ] below applied when @xmath64 we know that @xmath65 is a sum of squares , and so is    @xmath66    since @xmath67 , this finishes the proof .",
    "note that all computations in this final step are done with mathematica and involve rational numbers only  and are therefore exact .",
    "the missing lemma is a quantitative version of lemma 2 in @xcite :    [ estimate]let @xmath5 be a group with finite generating set @xmath68 , and let @xmath69\\ ] ] be the unnormalized laplace operator .",
    "let @xmath70^h$ ] be such that whenever @xmath71 , then @xmath72 is a product of at most @xmath73 elements from @xmath74",
