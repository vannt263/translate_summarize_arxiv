    "understanding the dynamics of polymers at the nanoscale is a great challenge , which is not only interesting from the conceptual viewpoint , but also because it is useful for applications in nanotechnology .",
    "the challenge stems from the fact that even single polymers can display a complex dynamical behavior .",
    "a popular example is translocation through a nanopore , a process which has attracted quite some attention in the past years ( see panja et al . and palyulin et al .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . in polymer translocation",
    ", the molecule is set into motion by an applied field at the pore side which acts as a linear pulling force .",
    "while the dynamics of pulled polymers has been thoroughly studied , less attention has been devoted to the properties of polymers performing rotational motion , which can be induced by applying a torque .",
    "there are several examples in which the rotational motion of a polymer is of relevance .",
    "for instance , in the dna double helix melting the two strands have to unwind from each other to separate .",
    "another example is the transcription process , where rna polymerase performs a rotational motion along the dna axis wrapping the emergent mrna molecule along the dna  @xcite .",
    "the torque caused by relative rotation of the nascent rna and dna during transcription induces dynamic supercoiling in the transcribed dna ( `` twin supercoiled domains '' ) which have a number of biological implications @xcite .",
    "also the closure of dna bubbles involves rotational dynamics  @xcite and rotational friction is involved in supercoil formation in dna  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the torque - induced dynamics on a flexible polymer using a theoretical model based on torque - balance equations and computer simulations .",
    "we find a rich dynamical behavior where the polymer conformation is characterized by three different regimes , illustrated in  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "in general the theoretical predictions are in very good agreement with the simulation results and there are many analogies with the steady state motion of a polymer pulled by a force . in addition , the rotational motion is characterized by a `` thinning '' regime , which has no analogous counterpart in the dynamics of pulled polymers .",
    "an isolated polymer in equilibrium is characterized by a single length scale , its flory radius @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 is the number of monomers and @xmath2 the monomer - monomer distance ) . in a polymer",
    "subject to confinement or to some external forces , instead , new length scales appear and the aforementioned global scaling generally breaks down . in these cases ,",
    "the polymer can be described as being composed of blobs  @xcite of characteristic size @xmath3 .",
    "depending on the system considered , the blobs can have constant size or their size may vary along the chain . according to the blob picture , the equilibrium scaling governed by the flory exponent @xmath4 , still holds at distances below @xmath3 , while the effect of the external perturbation becomes apparent at higher distances .",
    "a classical illustration of the blob model is a polymer in equilibrium stretched by forces applied at the two end monomers and pointing in opposite direction  @xcite . here",
    "blobs have a characteristic homogeneous size @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the applied force .",
    "the blob model has been applied to many other equilibrium problems in polymer physics , for instance in modeling dense melts  @xcite , polyelectrolytes stretched by an applied force  @xcite , polymers and biopolymers confined in nano - channels  @xcite and polymers adsorbed to surfaces  @xcite .",
    "the blob model also provides a powerful tool to study polymer dynamics , a paradigmatic example being a polymer pulled by one end  @xcite ( briefly reviewed in the following section ) .",
    "other out - of - equilibrium cases where the blob model has been applied include the already mentioned polymer translocation  @xcite , the dna hairpin folding  @xcite , the dna compression in a nanochannel  @xcite and the unwinding relaxation of a polymer from a fixed axis  @xcite .",
    "this paper discusses the steady state dynamics of a flexible polymer performing a rotational motion around a fixed and impenetrable rod  @xcite .",
    "this motion is induced by a constant torque applied at the one end monomer that is attached to the rod .",
    "hence it is different from the case in which the torque is applied to induce an internal twist dynamics on the polymer  @xcite .",
    "we consider polymers containing simple single covalent bonds without twisting energy .    after an initial transient regime",
    "the polymer performs a steady rotation with a constant angular velocity @xmath7 , which is the rotational counterpart of the steady linear velocity of a polymer pulled by a constant force . to explain the steady state dynamics",
    ", we develop a blob model in which _ torsional _ blobs have a rotational origin .",
    "they have different scaling properties from the _ tensile _ blobs arising in stretched or dragged polymers .",
    "our theory shows that , depending on the torque ( or angular velocity ) , the polymer can assume different conformations . for low torques",
    "one finds an equilibrium regime ( [ fig:1](a ) ) , followed by a trumpet regime at intermediate torques ( [ fig:1](b ) ) and a stem - trumpet regime at high @xmath7 ( [ fig:1](c ) ) . because of these regimes",
    ", the torque grows monotonically but not always linearly with the angular velocity .",
    "the theory is supported by langevin dynamics computer simulations .",
    "it is convenient to recall a few basic properties of polymers pulled at constant force , a case which has been well studied in the past  @xcite .",
    "this will allow us to establish some useful scaling relations , which will be compared to those for polymers under torque .",
    "the comparison will be made through the introduction of torsional  @xcite blobs . using the blob model we derive the relation between torque and rotational velocity .",
    "finally the elongation of a self - avoiding polymer along the rod is investigated .",
    "part of the theory of a stationary rotating polymer has already been developed in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we extend this theory to self - avoiding polymers and compute new quantities as the polymer elongation along the rod , which was not considered previously .",
    "consider a polymer , consisting of @xmath1 monomers , pulled by a constant force at one end . to label the monomers along the chain a coordinate @xmath8",
    "is used : the polymer is pulled at @xmath9 , while @xmath10 is the free end . after a transient phase",
    ", the polymer arrives in the steady state , moving with a constant velocity @xmath11 .",
    "the force difference between two closely lying points @xmath8 and @xmath12 is then fully compensated by the friction . the force balance yields @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the friction per monomer .",
    "note that we focus here to the rouse dynamics case , to which the simple relation applies . with hydrodynamic interactions , the effect of the conformation dependent friction should be taken into account @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic case is briefly discussed at the end of this section .",
    "the differential equation has solution @xmath15 , where we used the boundary condition @xmath16 .",
    "we obtain the following relation between the pulling force @xmath17 and the velocity : @xmath18 the force is related to the blob size as @xmath19 where we introduced a monomer - scale characteristic time @xmath20 ( throughout the paper we use the symbol @xmath21 to indicate a  quasi - equality \" between two quantities , meaning that numerical prefactors of the order unity are neglected ) .",
    "weak forces do not significantly perturb the shape of the polymer .",
    "the threshold force which produces a perturbation can be obtained from the requirement that the size of the initial blob , @xmath22 , exceeds the equilibrium radius of the polymer : @xmath23 .",
    "this leads to @xmath24 for stronger forces the polymer consists of blobs of varying size and distributed from the free end according to , i.e. the blob size grows towards the free end .",
    "this so - called trumpet regime ends when the smallest blob has a size comparable to the monomer - monomer distance , i.e. @xmath25 . the trumpet regime appears for forces in the following range : @xmath26 at higher forces , @xmath27 part of the polymer close to the pulled monomer is stretched , while the end part still has the trumpet shape . for simplicity the boundaries between the three regimes were obtained using static criteria .",
    "we note that they can also be obtained from dynamic criteria involving the drift velocity of the polymer . for instance",
    "the equilibrium regime can be characterized from the requirement @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the longest relaxation time . in the relation",
    "we require that the distance covered by the polymer in a time equal to @xmath30 is smaller than its equilibrium radius , i.e. the polymer moves sufficiently slow so that it equilibrates while leaving a region of the size of its radius .",
    "it can be easily seen that is identical to ) .",
    "analogous arguments can be used to derive and ) .",
    "the three regimes characterized by the inequalities - are the tensile counterparts of those shown in  [ fig:1 ] for polymers under torque . for comparison with the rotating polymer it is useful to compute the end - to - end extension of a polymer pulled by a force . in the trumpet regime , where the scaling applies to the whole polymer ,",
    "the end - to - end distance is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the number of monomers per blob .",
    "note that at the threshold of the equilibrium regime @xmath33 the force - velocity relation yields : @xmath34 substituting this expression in we recover the equilibrium result @xmath35 .",
    "consider now the rotational counterpart of a pulled polymer , where a torque @xmath36 is applied to the monomer attached to the rod  @xcite",
    ". for weak torques we expect that , analogous to the case of a pulled polymer , the polymer will perform a rotational motion while maintaining its equilibrium shape . using the threshold value for the polymer pulled by a constant force , an upper bound for the torque in the equilibrium regime is found : @xmath37 here @xmath6 is the characteristic value of the applied force and @xmath38 the equilibrium radius . using @xmath39 , which relates linear to rotational velocity , together with the force - velocity expression , the inequality can be rewritten : @xmath40 this establishes the threshold value for the equilibrium regime for given @xmath1 and @xmath7 ( the characteristic monomer - scale time , @xmath41 , is defined in ) .",
    "note the similarities of the previous inequality with : the inequality in requires the relaxation of the rotating polymer while performing a fraction @xmath42 of a turn .",
    "it should be stressed that the condition for the equilibrium regime @xmath43 is correct up to logarithmic terms which , because they are dimensionless , can not be extracted from scaling considerations",
    ". a more accurate handling of these terms is reported in the section discussing the dependence of the torque on @xmath7 .",
    "we now use a torque balance argument to set up a differential equation for @xmath44 , the torque @xmath36 as a function of the monomer coordinate @xmath8 .",
    "this is the rotational version of , which related the force to @xmath8 in the tensile case .",
    "consider a torsional blob of size @xmath45 which rotates around the rod at fixed angular velocity @xmath7 .",
    "the infinitesimal torque difference is @xmath46 , while the friction @xmath47 .",
    "the force balance then gives @xmath48 unlike in the pulling case , , the blob size @xmath45 appears in the previous equation , reflecting the fact that the rotational friction is conformation - dependent even without the hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "to close , we thus need to know the local relation between the torque and the torsional blob size . to this end",
    "we consider the equilibrium properties of a polymer wound around a rod .",
    "the winding angle @xmath49 of a polymer attached to a rod is defined as @xmath50 times the number of turns the polymer performs around the rod , starting from the fixed end . in equilibrium",

    "the boundary between the trumpet and stem - trumpet regime is obtained when @xmath67 , which yields @xmath68    in summary : we expect three distinct regimes , with boundaries given by the analysis above .",

    "there is an overall quite satisfactory quantitative agreement between theory and simulations , keeping into account that we use no adjustable parameters in , and ( we used @xmath188 as estimated from our simulations units ) .",
    "comparing the simulations with the torsional blob theory predictions , we find that the differences are at most within a factor three .",
    "we recall that the torque - balance arguments in the blob theory are based on quasi - equalities which ignore unknown numerical prefactors which are expected to be of the order of unity . a more detailed test of the dependence of @xmath36 on @xmath7 in the trumpet regime ( as predicted by )",

    "the crossover between these two regimes around @xmath198 is indeed observed in [ fig : elongation ] , where the data belonging to polymers of different lengths collapse into a single curve .",
    "in this paper , we gave a full description of the _ stationary _ rotation of a flexible polymer induced by a torque . using a local torque - balance equation",
    ", we computed the polymer shape as a function of the curvilinear coordinate @xmath8 .",
    "we identify three regimes as the angular velocity increases ( or equivalently , when the torque applied to the monomer attached to the rod increases ) .",
    "( i )  the equilibrium regime , where the polymer is not perturbed from its equilibrium configuration .",
    "( ii )  the trumpet regime , in which the polymer is composed of blobs of decreasing size , starting from the free end .",
    "here the blob size decays as @xmath199 , which is much slower than the case of a constant force applied at one end ( @xmath200 ) .",
    "finally ( iii ) the stem - trumpet regime is defined when a part of the polymer close to the attached monomer is tightly wound around the axis while the free end still displays a trumpet shape .",
    "one of the central results of this paper is the characterization of the response of the total torque @xmath36 to a change of the angular velocity @xmath7 or the number of monomers @xmath1 . in the equilibrium and the stem - trumpet regime ,",
    "the torque is proportional to the angular velocity @xmath201 .",
    "the torque friction , @xmath202 , has a different scaling behavior with the polymer length in equilibrium @xmath203 compared to the stem - trumpet regime @xmath204 .",
    "more surprisingly , in the trumpet regime the torque has a very weak ( logarithmic ) dependence on @xmath7 .",
    "this dependence stems from the fact that when the torque is increased the polymer gets closer to the central axis hereby reducing the resistance to the rotational motion .",
    "non - power law , and specifically logarithmic , behavior has already been predicted , simulated and observed in the case of polymer stretching.@xcite however , in that case a situation where both ends are subjected to a force is studied and the logarithmic dependence represents an increase of resistance for high forces due to short - scale dna crumpling .",
    "the setup we consider is different : the resistance decreases in an intermediate torque regime , due to the decrease in distance between the polymer and the rod .",
    "the torque - torsional blob relation is an analogue of the well - known force - tensile blob relation in the pulling problem @xcite , and is expected to play an essential role to further explore the rotational dynamics",
    ". it would be interesting to check experimentally the predictions of the theory .",
    "the experimental protocol could be achieved with excitable cylinders in an optical torque wrench  @xcite .",
    "a polymer could be attached to the cylinder and the other end of the polymer labelled with a fluorescent molecule , allowing , e.g. , to test the dependence of spacing of the free end from the axis of rotation with respect to the angular velocity .",
