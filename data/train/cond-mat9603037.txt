    "computational methods for interacting electrons in a strong magnetic field have been developing rapidly in the last decade.@xcite they employ different geometries which suggest different sets of single - electron wave functions and quantum numbers of many - electron states .",
    "the toroidal geometry was advanced by yoshioka , halperin , and lee.@xcite the symmetry classification of the many - electron functions in this geometry was proposed by haldane.@xcite afterwards most of the finite - size computations were performed in the framework of the spherical geometry proposed and developed by haldane and rezayi.@xcite    landau functions , eigenfunctions of angular momentum , and localized functions called coherent states@xcite are usually used in the plane geometry .",
    "localized functions have obvious advantages as applied to the wigner crystal theory and also to some systems with strongly inhomogeneous potential distribution .",
    "we expect that these functions may also be effective as the basis functions for numerical diagonalization .",
    "since the matrix size increases exponentially with the number of particles , @xmath7 , this number is strongly restricted by computational facilities , e.g. , by @xmath8 for the filling factor @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , it seems tempting to develop some procedure for a strong reduction of the dimension of the hilbert space by eliminating functions which make only a small contribution to the low - energy states .",
    "we believe that the prospects for such an approach are promising since the correlation energy , @xmath10 , which can be evaluated by the magnitude of the laughlin gap or by the energy difference between the liquid and solid phases , is small compared with the characteristic coulomb energy , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the magnetic length .",
    "the inequality @xmath13 implies that the subspace chosen for diagonalization can be restricted by the electron configurations with low hartree - fock energies .",
    "such an approach has been recently developed and successfully applied to electrons on a lattice.@xcite    as a first step in developing a low - energy states selecting procedure , one should construct a basis of localized , particle - like functions with a characteristic size about @xmath5 .",
    "however , some general requirements exclude the existence of a complete system of single - electron states which are both exponentially localized and linearly independent .",
    "this point should be explained in more detail .",
    "the coherent states@xcite on a von neumann lattice are the most localized eigenfunctions for an electron in a magnetic field .",
    "for such a lattice , with a single flux quantum per a unit cell , the area of a unit cell equals @xmath14 .",
    "the set of coherent states , @xmath15 , of the lowest landau level ( lll ) can be obtained by the magnetic translations of the function @xmath16 from the origin to all lattice sites , @xmath1 .",
    "the set @xmath15 is complete , i.e. , an arbitrary function belonging to the lll can be expanded in functions @xmath15 .",
    "this statement is physically appealing and is supported by a rigorous mathematical proof.@xcite the functions @xmath15 are obviously non - orthogonal .",
    "a straightforward way to orthogonalize such a set is to transform it into the bloch representation , and then go back to the site representation .",
    "wannier applied this procedure to a one - dimensional chain of gaussians.@xcite if the functions @xmath15 were linearly independent , this orthogonalization procedure would result in a set of exponentially localized functions .",
    "however , perelomov@xcite has established a non - trivial fact that the set @xmath15 is actually overcomplete by exactly one function and presented the explicit form of the linear equation relating these functions ; see eq .",
    "( [ eqoc ] ) below .",
    "the overcompleteness of the set @xmath15 imposes hard restrictions on the localization of wannier functions .",
    "zak and collaborators@xcite have shown that the exponential localization and the orthogonality of magnetic orbitals are incompatible .",
    "thouless@xcite proved even a stronger result by relating the localization of magnetic orbitals to the existence of the hall current .",
    "he showed that in systems supporting a hall current the orbitals should fall off with distance no faster than by the inverse - square law , hence , @xmath6 is a critical exponent .",
    "having in mind these restrictions on the falloff of magnetic orbitals , one can question whether particle - like orbitals suitable for restricted - basis finite - size calculations do exist .",
    "it is the main result of this paper that a set of two - scale orbitals @xmath0 , which satisfy the above requirements exists.@xcite in the small @xmath17 region , @xmath18 , the orbital @xmath2 is very close to the gaussian @xmath19 , and this region contributes about 95% to the normalization integral . for @xmath20 ,",
    "the function @xmath2 falls off as @xmath6 in exact correspondence with the thouless criterion and shows an oscillatory behavior which ensures orthogonality to the different orbitals @xmath0 .",
    "the term wannier functions is usually applied only to the orbitals which fall off exponentially .",
    "since the functions @xmath0 are normalizable and have a well localized gaussian core , we shall term them as wannier functions in what follows .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
