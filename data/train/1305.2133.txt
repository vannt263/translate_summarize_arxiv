    "the new massive gravity ( nmg )  @xcite theory has deserved special attention due to its remarkable physical properties . since lower - dimensional gravity has been an active field of research in order to shed some light on the behavior of classical and quantum aspects of this interaction , models in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions",

    "this action gives rise to field equations with a second order trace .",
    "its linearized version is equivalent to the fierz - pauli action for a massive spin-2 field in three dimension , so it is a unitary model  @xcite .",
    "this theory admits black hole - type solutions asymptotically lifshitz , characterized by the metrics  @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a @xmath11-dimensional vector .",
    "these space - times present invariance under the rescaling @xmath12 .",
    "many investigations have addressed to find black hole solutions which asymptote the metrics given by ( [ ansatz0 ] ) .",
    "a four - dimensional topological black hole which is asymptotically lifshitz with dynamical exponent @xmath13 was found in  @xcite .",
    "other lifshitz black hole solutions were investigated in  @xcite . a black hole solution for @xmath13 in @xmath14",
    "was found in  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "our aim is to investigate the geodesic structure of black hole space - time which is a solution of the three - dimensional nmg theory and is asymptotically lifshitz with @xmath0 and @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "similar studies have been made for topological lifshitz black hole in @xmath15 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "we investigate all the possible movements allowed in this space - time by means of a detailed analysis of the effective potentials .",
    "we find the exact solutions describing the path of massive particles and photons . in order to obtain a direct visualization of the allowed motions , we plot the orbits found .    in section",
    "ii , we derive the geodesic equations of motion using the variational problem associated with the metric of the black hole space - time found in  @xcite . for both massive particles and photons",
    "the following issues are investigated : i ) the effective potential of the equivalent one - dimensional problem , which allows us to restrict the motions if they are radial or presents a non - zero angular momentum , ii ) the exact solution for radial geodesics in terms of the proper and coordinate time , and iii ) exact solutions for the polar equation in motions with angular momentum .",

    "besides , these function take the value @xmath23 when @xmath24 , which means that the metrics are asymptotically lifshitz . in order to have a single horizon",
    "it was required that these functions present a single - zero at location of the horizon ( @xmath25 ) . for the case",
    "@xmath0 the equations of motions are solved choosing the following form for the functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an integration constant and @xmath28 is the length associated to the three - dimensional cosmological constant .",
    "this solution corresponds to the static asymptotically lifshitz black hole , whose metric can be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 . the kretschmann scalar associated to this metric",

    "was first studied in  @xcite and a general study of its structure geodesic was explored in  @xcite .",
    "let us mention some differences of the space - time described by the metric ( [ e.1 ] ) and the btz black hole .",
    "contrary to our intuition in @xmath15 dimensions where gravity increases as the distance to the center of force diminishes ( and so does the curvature ) , which is a property of the schwarzschild metric ; in the btz black hole the curvature is constant and negative .",
    "nevertheless , the lifshitz black hole solution has a variable curvature as eq.([kresh ] ) shows . for",
    "the btz black hole @xmath27 is the conserved charge associated with asymptotic invariance under displacement , so it can be identified with the black hole mass . in the case of lifshitz black hole",
    ", its mass has been evaluated in  @xcite , using the euclidean action approach  @xcite with the action given in  @xcite .",
    "the expression found for the mass , @xmath40 , is @xmath41 indicating the relationship between the constant of integration which appears in the metric ( [ e.1 ] ) and the black hole mass .    in order to compute the geodesic structures of the lifshitz black hole , we start from the lagrangian given by @xmath42 where a dot corresponds to the derivative with respect to an affine parameter , @xmath43 , along the trajectory , and @xmath44 for massless particles and @xmath45 for massive particles . considering that the lagrangian ( [ gs1 ] ) is independent of @xmath46 , their corresponding conjugate momenta , @xmath47 ,",
    "are conserved , and are given by @xmath48 respectively . using these constants of motion in the radial equation",
