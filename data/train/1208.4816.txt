    "the principal goal of this paper is a quadrature designed for the integration of bandlimited functions of a specified band limit @xmath8 .",
    "a function @xmath9 is bandlimited of band limit @xmath10 , if there exists a function @xmath11 $ ] such that @xmath12 in other words , the fourier transform of a bandlimited function is compactly supported .",
    "while defines @xmath13 for all real @xmath14 , one is often interested in bandlimited functions , whose argument is confined to an interval , e.g. @xmath15 .",
    "such functions are encountered in physics ( wave phenomena , fluid dynamics ) , engineering ( signal processing ) , etc .",
    "( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    by quadrature",
    "we mean a set of nodes @xmath16 and weights @xmath17 if @xmath18 is a bandlimited function , we use the quadrature to approximate the integral of @xmath13 over the interval @xmath19 by a finite sum ; more specifically , @xmath20 about half a century ago it was observed that the eigenfunctions of the integral operator @xmath21 \\to l^2\\left[-1,1\\right]$ ] , defined via the formula @xmath22 ( x ) = \\int_{-1}^1 \\varphi(t ) e^{icxt } \\ ; dt , \\label{eq_intro_fc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] provide a natural tool for dealing with bandlimited functions , defined on the interval @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "moreover , it was observed ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) that the eigenfunctions of @xmath24 are precisely the prolate spheroidal wave functions ( pswfs ) of band limit @xmath0 , well known from the mathematical physics ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , when designing a quadrature for the integration of bandlimited functions of band limit @xmath10 , it is natural to require that this quadrature integrate several first pswfs of band limit @xmath0 with high accuracy .",
    "we formulate the principal objective of this paper in a more precise manner , as follows .",
    "suppose that @xmath10 is a real number .",
    "for every integer @xmath25 , we define a quadrature of order @xmath1 ( for the integration of bandlimited functions of band limit @xmath0 over @xmath19 ) by specifying @xmath1 nodes and @xmath1 weights ( see , ) .",

    "we require that , for sufficiently large @xmath1 , the quadrature of order @xmath1 integrate the first @xmath1 pswfs of band limit @xmath0 up to the error @xmath27 .",
    "more specifically , we find the integer @xmath28 such that , for every integer @xmath29 and all integer @xmath30 , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the @xmath33th pswf of band limit @xmath0 ( see section  [ sec_pswf ] ) .",
    "quadratures for the integration of bandlimited functions which satisfy have already been discussed in the literature , for example :    _ * quadrature 1 . * _ suppose that @xmath34 is an integer .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of @xmath1 nodes and weights , such that holds for @xmath35 and all @xmath36 , was first observed more than 100 years ago ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) for all chebyshev systems , of which pswfs are a special case ( see @xcite ) .",
    "although numerical algorithms for the design of this optimal quadrature were recently constructed ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , they tend to be rather expensive ( require order @xmath37 operations with a large proportionality constant ) .",
    "_ * quadrature 2 . * _ another quadrature was suggested in @xcite .",
    "the pswf @xmath38 has @xmath1 roots @xmath39 in the interval @xmath19 ( see theorem  [ thm_pswf_main ] in section  [ sec_pswf ] ) ; the idea is to use these roots as the quadrature nodes , solve the linear system of @xmath1 equations @xmath40 for the unknowns @xmath41 , and use the resulting weights and nodes to define a quadrature for the integration of functions of band limit @xmath42 .",
    "this approach is justified by the generalization of the euclid s division algorithm for pswfs ( see @xcite ) , and is less expensive computationally than the previous one ( its cost is dominated by the cost of solving the linear system ) . the same quadrature can be used to integrate functions of band limit @xmath0 , since implies that holds with @xmath35 , for all @xmath43 . in this paper , we describe another quadrature whose nodes are the @xmath1 roots of @xmath38 in @xmath44 . however , its weights differ from the solution of , and can be evaluated in @xmath45 operations ( see section  [ sec_quad ] and section  [ sec_numerical ] below ) .    thus , the quadratures of this paper are much faster to evaluate than those described above",
    ". moreover , ensures that their accuracy is similar to that of quadrature 2 .",
    "also , their nodes and weights can be used as starting points for the scheme that computes the optimal quadrature 1 .    in order to define the weights , to make sure that holds and to be able to compute them efficiently , we need to analyze the pswfs in a somewhat detailed manner .",
    "this analysis will be preceded by a heuristic explanation , which provides some intuition as well as prevents one from the danger of not seeing the forest for the trees ( see section  [ sec_intuition ] below ) .",

    "it is easy to verify that , for every @xmath54 , the polynomial @xmath55 is defined via the formula @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the polynomial of degree @xmath1 whose roots are precisely @xmath39 .",

    "the basis functions are the pswfs and not the polynomials .",
    "suppose that the roots @xmath39 of @xmath38 in the interval @xmath19 are chosen to be the nodes of the quadrature .",
    "if we choose the weights @xmath50 such that the resulting quadrature integrates the first @xmath1 pswfs exactly , this will lead to the linear system , and hence to quadrature 2 from section  [ sec_outline ] .",
