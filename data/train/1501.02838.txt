    "type  ia supernovae have a well - defined luminosity , permitting their use as standard candles under the assumption that the luminosities of nearby and distant sources are similarly related to color and light - curve shape .",
    "the use of such events has thus  far produced the most reliable measurement of the expansion history of the universe ( perlmutter et  al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ; garnavich et  al .  1998",
    "; schmidt et  al .  1998 ; riess et  al .  1998 ) , leading to the discovery of dark energy .    in recent years",
    ", several samples of type  ia supernova events have been assembled , and several of these have been merged to form even larger compilations , such as the union2.1 sample ( kowalski et  al .  2008 ;",
    "suzuki et  al .",
    "2012 ) , which currently contains 580 supernova detections , including events at redshift @xmath5 observed with the _ hubble _ space telescope ( see , e.g. , kuznetsova et  al .  2008 ; dawson et  al .  2009 ;",
    "riess et  al .",
    "2011 ) . however , while such merged samples offer several advantages , the fact that each sample has its own set of systematic and intrinsic uncertainties makes it difficult to fit a cosmological model to any merged sample .",
    "as we shall discuss , and as kim ( 2011 ) and others have already pointed  out , it is questionable whether the model parameters can be estimated by simply minimizing a  @xmath6 , since parameters characterizing error dispersion(s ) must be estimated simultaneously .",
    "one commonly used method estimates error dispersion(s ) by constraining the reduced  @xmath6 , i.e. , the @xmath6 per degree of freedom , to equal unity .",
    "we shall find that the method of maximum likelihood estimation ( mle ) is to be preferred ; but in any method , the presence of multiple dispersion parameters is a complication .    fortunately , some of the homogeneous samples are themselves quite large , and perfectly suited to the type of comparative analysis we wish to carry  out in this paper . in  fact ,",
    "almost half of all the type  ia sne in the union2.1 compilation were derived from the single , homogeneous sample assembled during the first three years of the supernova legacy survey ( snls ; guy et  al .",
    "this catalog contains 252 high redshift type  ia supernovae ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the multi - color light - curves of these sne were measured using the megaprime / megacam instrument at the canada  france ",
    "hawaii telescope ( cfht ) , using repeated imaging of four one - square degree fields in four bands .",
    "the vlt , gemini and keck telescopes were used to confirm the nature of the sne and to measure their redshifts . very importantly ,",
    "since the same instruments and reduction techniques were employed for all 252 events , it is appropriate to include a _ single _ intrinsic dispersion in the analysis of the hubble diagram ( hd ) constructed from this sample .",
    "the study of catalogs such as this has led to a general consensus that @xmath0cdm offers the best explanation for the redshift ",
    "luminosity relationship , and observational work is now focused primarily on refining the fits to improve the precision with which the model parameters are determined .",
    "this is one of the principal motivations for attempting to merge samples to create catalogs with broader redshift coverage and better statistics .",
    "but as successful as this program has been , several drawbacks associated with the use of type  ia supernovae have made it necessary to seek alternative methods of probing the cosmic spacetime .",
    "it is quite difficult to use supernova measurements in unbiased , comparative studies of competing expansion histories , since at  least three or four ` nuisance ' parameters characterizing the standard candle must be optimized simultaneously with each model s free parameters , rendering the data compliant to the underlying theory ( kowalski et  al .  2008 ; suzuki et  al .",
    "2012 ; melia 2012a ) .",
    "several notable attempts have been made to mitigate the impact of this model dependence , e.g. , through the use of kinematic variables and geometric probes that avoid parametrizing the fits in terms of pre - assumed model components ( shafieloo et al .",
    "in the end , however , even these models require the availability of measurements based on standard candles .",
    "unfortunately , type ia sne may be used for this purpose only as long as the nuisance parameters characterizing their lightcurves are known .",
    "the application of such methods to the union2.1 type ia sn sample uses nuisance parameters optimized for the concordance model , so the current results are not completely free of any biases .",

    "in contrast to the perception based on type  ia sne that @xmath0cdm can best account for the observed expansion of the universe , the conclusion from these other studies is that the cosmic dynamics is better described by a cosmology we refer to as the @xmath8 universe ( melia 2007 ; melia & abdelqader 2009 ; melia & shevchuk 2012 ) .",
    "for example , a comparative analysis was recently carried out of the @xmath0cdm and @xmath2 cosmologies using the grb hubble diagram ( wei et  al .",
    "this study found that once the various parameters are estimated for each model individually , the @xmath2 cosmology provides a better fit to the data .",
    "and although about @xmath9 of the grb events lie at  least @xmath10 away from the best - fit curves ( in both models ) , suggesting either that some contamination by non - standard grb luminosities is unavoidable , or that the errors and intrinsic scatter associated with the data are being underestimated , various model selection techniques applied to the grb data show that the likelihood of @xmath8 being the correct model rather than @xmath0cdm is @xmath3 versus @xmath4",
    ".    moreover , although the redshift  distance relationship is essentially the same in @xmath0cdm and the @xmath2 universe ( even out to @xmath11 ) , the redshift  age relationship is not .",
    "this motivated a recent examination of whether or not the observed growth rate of high-@xmath1 quasars could be used to test the various models .",
    "quasars at @xmath12 are now known to be accreting at , or near , their eddington limit ( see , e.g. , willott et  al .  2010a , b ; de  rosa et  al .",
    "2011 ) , which presents a problem for @xmath0cdm because this makes it difficult to understand how @xmath13 supermassive black holes could have appeared only 700900 myr after the big  bang . instead , in @xmath2",
    ", their emergence at redshift @xmath14 corresponds to a cosmic age of @xmath15 gyr , which was enough time for them to begin growing from @xmath16 seeds ( presumably the remnants of pop  ii and  iii supernovae ) at @xmath17 ( i.e. , _",
    "after _ the onset of re - ionization ) and still reach a billion solar masses by @xmath18 via standard , eddington - limited accretion ( melia 2013a ) .    in light of this apparent conflict between the implications of the type  ia supernova work and the results of other studies ,",
    "we have begun to look more closely at the possibility of directly comparing how @xmath0cdm and @xmath2 account for the supernova measurements themselves .",
    "this is not an easy task , principally because of the enormous amount of work that goes into first establishing the sn magnitudes , and then carefully fitting the data using the comprehensive set of parameters available to @xmath0cdm ( see , e.g. , suzuki et  al .",
    "2012 ) . in a previous paper ( melia 2012a ) , the redshift  distance relationship in @xmath0cdm was compared with that predicted by @xmath2 , and each with the union2.1 sample .",
    "it was shown that the two theories produce virtually indistinguishable profiles , though the fit with @xmath2 had not yet been fully optimized .",
    "that  is , despite the fact that this previous analysis simply used @xmath2 to fit the data optimized with @xmath0cdm , the results were quite promising , suggesting that a full optimization procedure  followed separately for @xmath2 and @xmath0cdm  ought to be carried  out .",
    "the principal goal of this paper is to complete this study .",
    "a direct comparison of @xmath0cdm with @xmath2 using type  ia sne is also motivated by recent theoretical work suggesting that the friedmann  robertson  walker ( frw ) metric is more specialized than was previously thought ( melia 2013b ) .",
    "a close examination of the physics behind the symmetries incorporated into this well - known and often employed solution to einstein s equations showed that the frw metric applies only to a fluid with zero active mass , i.e. , a fluid in which @xmath19 , where @xmath20  is the _ total _ pressure and @xmath21 the _ total _ energy density .",
    "this is consistent with the equation - of - state used in @xmath2 , but not in @xmath0cdm , except that when one averages the pressure , @xmath22 , over the age of the universe , one does get @xmath23 for the estimated @xmath0cdm parameters .",
    "@xmath0cdm therefore appears to be an empirical approximation to @xmath8 , asymptotically approaching the requirements of the zero active mass condition consistent with the frw metric .    in   2 of this paper",
    ", we briefly summarize the contents of the snls sample , and explain the model parameters ( including those associated with the data ) that are to be estimated .",
    "we present the fits to the supernova data in    3 , and a direct comparison between @xmath0cdm and the @xmath8 universe",
    "is made in    4 .",
    "we  end with a discussion and conclusions in    5 .",
    "the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) sample contains 252 high - redshift ( @xmath24 ) type  ia sne discovered during the first three years of operation ( guy et  al .",
    "one of the most important features of this catalog is that it constitutes a single , homogeneous sample .",

    "] when corrected for shape and color , type  ia sn luminosities have a dispersion of only  @xmath35 . the coefficients @xmath36 are thus the parameters of a luminosity model , though it is not a full statistical model , since it lacks an explicit error dispersion parameter . in the present context , @xmath36 and  @xmath30",
    "are ` nuisance ' parameters , as they can not be estimated independently of an assumed cosmology .",
    "they must be optimized simultaneously with the cosmological parameters , as will be explained in   3 .    the theoretical distance modulus @xmath37 is calculated for each  sn from its measured redshift @xmath1 by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the model - dependent luminosity distance .",
    "a  determination of  @xmath40 requires the assumption of a particular expansion scenario .",
    "both @xmath0cdm and @xmath2 are frw cosmologies , but the former assumes specific constituents in the density , written as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 are , respectively , the energy densities of radiation , matter ( luminous and dark ) , and the cosmological constant  @xmath0 .",
    "these are often expressed in  terms of today s critical density , @xmath43 , where @xmath44  is the hubble constant , by @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 . in  a flat universe with zero spatial curvature ,",
    "the total scaled energy density is @xmath48 . since @xmath49 , @xmath50 . in @xmath2 , on the other hand , whatever constituents are present in  @xmath21 , the principal constraint is the total equation - of - state @xmath51 , which as we mentioned in   1 , is in  fact required by the use of the frw metric .",
    "when dark energy is included with an unknown equation - of - state , @xmath52 , the general form of the luminosity distance in @xmath0cdm is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the speed of light .",

    "in this paper , we shall use two methods for calculating point and interval estimates of cosmological model parameters : one a method commonly used in past analyses ( e.g. , kowalski et  al .",
    "2008 ; guy et  al .  2010",
    "; suzuki et  al .",
    "2012 ) , and one more recently proposed , which is based on maximizing the likelihood function ( e.g. , kim 2011 ; melia & maier 2013 ; wei et  al .  2013 ) .",
    "as we shall see , the latter allows us to estimate all parameters , including the unknown intrinsic dispersion .",
    "but we shall find that under some circumstances , the manner in which this latter method works offers some justification for the former , which instead , minimizes  @xmath6 subject to the condition that the reduced  @xmath6 equal unity . in either method , however , nuisance parameters characterizing the sn  luminosities , and free parameters of the cosmological model , must be fitted simultaneously .    _ initial remark on free parameters . _",
    "before we begin the actual fitting of the various models , we take a moment to summarize the free parameters available in each .",
    "as alluded to earlier , it is now understood that the symmetries incorporated into the frw metric require a zero active mass condition ( i.e. , @xmath67 ) in the cosmic fluid ( melia 2013b ) .",
    "one can understand this even without a formal proof , by using the following reasoning .    in spherically symmetric spacetimes , which include the special frw case , a proper mass emerges from the introduction of the metric into einstein s field equations .",
    "we call this the misner  sharp mass ( misner & sharp 1964 ) , which is defined as @xmath68 , in terms of the gravitational radius @xmath69 .",
    "this proper mass is a consequence of birkhoff s theorem ( birkhoff 1923 ) , which states that none of the mass - energy beyond  @xmath70 contributes to the spacetime curvature within a shell at this radius . the gravitational radius must therefore be defined as written here , although the cosmos itself may be infinite .",
    "but since @xmath71 is a proper mass defined in  terms of the proper density  @xmath21 and proper volume , @xmath70  must therefore be a proper radius as  well .",
    "thus , by weyl s postulate ( weyl 1923 ) , this gravitational radius must have the form @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the universal expansion factor and @xmath74  is a constant comoving distance .",
    "one can therefore easily show from the first friedmann equation ( see , e.g. , melia & shevchuk 2012 ) that @xmath75 , where @xmath56  is the spatial curvature constant .",
    "in other words , the expansion rate  @xmath76 must be constant , which then leads , via the second friedmann ( or ` acceleration ' ) equation , to the condition @xmath51 .",
    "the equation - of - state @xmath77 is therefore required in this cosmology , and can not be adjusted to optimize fits to the data .",
    "further , since @xmath78 , one can easily see that the hubble radius @xmath79 must be given as @xmath80 in this cosmology .",
    "but in general relativity , we recognize such a surface moving at proper speed  @xmath54 relative to an observer in the co - moving frame as an event horizon .",
    "so if the misner ",
    "sharp mass gives rise to the gravitational radius  @xmath70 , which is identified with @xmath81 , then from the friedmann equation we must also have @xmath82 .",
    "the @xmath2 universe is therefore flat and has a unique , fixed equation - of - state @xmath77 .",
    "it  has only one free parameter : the hubble constant  @xmath44 .    in @xmath0cdm",
    "there is some flexibility in choosing our free parameters for the analysis of type  ia sne , depending on how we characterize dark energy . at the very minimum ,",
    "we may adjust @xmath83 , @xmath56 ( or , equivalently ,  @xmath84 ) , @xmath85 and  @xmath44 .",
    "( note that additional free parameters , such as the baryon density , may be relevant to fits involving the cmb , but are not necessary for constructing the sn hubble diagram . ) and though inflation is not yet a fully self - consistent model , we may include it as a foundation for @xmath0cdm , in which case we could reasonably argue that @xmath82 .",
    "however , even inflation does not specify the equation - of - state for dark energy . and",
    "using priors from other kinds of observations is not really appropriate for this work , because their values change from observation to observation  and from instrument to instrument .",
    "for example , note that the values of @xmath85 and  @xmath83 from wmap ( bennett et  al .",
    "2003 ) are quite different from those inferred by _ planck _",
    "( ade et  al .  2014 ) .",
    "the most basic @xmath0cdm model we may use for supernova work thus has three free parameters .",
    "below , we shall choose the parameters @xmath83 , @xmath85 and  @xmath44 to represent the standard model , since these are the three that produce the most favorable fits when using @xmath0cdm , based on what is currently known .",

    "( 2010 ) , determines the best - fit cosmology by ( iteratively ) minimizing the @xmath6 function @xmath86 over a joint parameter space , thereby optimizing both the nuisance parameters @xmath87 and the cosmological parameters .",
    "here @xmath88  ranges over the serial numbers of the sne in the snls catalog , and @xmath89 depends on  @xmath87 according to equation  1 ; and of  course , @xmath90 depends on the cosmological parameters .",
    "the sn - specific dispersion @xmath91 is defined by @xmath92 where @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 are the standard errors of the peak magnitude and light - curve parameters of the  sn .",
    "the term @xmath96 comes from the covariances among @xmath34 , and likewise depends quadratically on  @xmath36 .",
    "the quantity @xmath97 is an intrinsic ( i.e. , sn - independent ) dispersion , the value of which is set by requiring that the reduced @xmath98 equal unity .",

    "we then repeat this process until the established convergence accuracy can be satisfied . for each markov chain , we generate @xmath111 samples consistent with the likelihood function .",

    "it is only subdominant terms that are affected by such considerations as the choice of a bayesian prior ( kuha 2004 ) , or the extent of the model nonlinearity if  any ( haughton 1988 ) .",

    "more importantly , we have found that , when the parameter optimization is handled via the joint likelihood function , both @xmath0cdm and @xmath8 fit their individually optimized data very well .",

    "the fact that the fits to the data using @xmath0cdm often come very close to those of @xmath2 ( see figure  5 ) lends weight to our suspicion that the standard model functions as an empirical approximation to the latter , since it has more free parameters and lacks that essential ingredient in @xmath2 : the equation - of - state @xmath51 . in attempting to identify the reasons why @xmath0cdm produces phases of acceleration and deceleration ,",
