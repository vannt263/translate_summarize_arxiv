    "for a polytope @xmath6 of dimension @xmath4 , the _ face vector _ of @xmath6 is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number of @xmath9-dimensional faces of @xmath6 .",
    "it is an ongoing investigation to describe the face vectors for @xmath4-dimensional convex polytopes .",
    "the case @xmath10 are the only cases where this description is complete . a nice theorem by steinitz  @xcite states that an integer vector @xmath11 is a face vector for a three dimensional polytope @xmath6 if and only if ( i ) we have the euler relation @xmath12 , ( ii ) @xmath13 and ( iii ) @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , the first inequality is tight if and only if @xmath6 is simplicial , the second one is tight if and only if @xmath6 is simple .",
    "the only linear equation satisfied by the entries of the face vector is the euler - poincar relation @xmath15 , that holds for all polytopes of dimension @xmath4 . for higher dimensions",
    "@xmath16 no such nice description of face vectors has been found yet . in the hope of obtaining a description of a polytope in terms of parameters / entries of a vector",
    ", there is the _ flag vector _ @xmath17 , containing @xmath18 entries where for each @xmath19 the entry @xmath20 denotes the number of strict chains ( or _ flags _ ) @xmath21 of faces of @xmath6 where @xmath22 .",
    "the entries @xmath20 do satisfy the generalized dehn - sommerville equations which , together with the existence of matching polytopes , implies that the linear span of flag vectors of @xmath4-dimensional polytopes is precisely @xmath23 , the @xmath4-th fibonacci number , as shown in the seminal paper  @xcite .",
    "one way to encode the information contained in the flag vector of a @xmath4-polytope @xmath6 is to define the @xmath24-index , a linear combination of non - commuting monomials in @xmath25 and @xmath26 of degree @xmath4 in the following way : for @xmath27 let @xmath28 , where @xmath29 if @xmath30 and @xmath31 if @xmath32 .",
    "the _ @xmath24-index _",
    "@xmath33 for @xmath6 is then defined as @xmath34 , where the sum is over all @xmath27 and @xmath35 .",
    "an elegant consequence of the generalized dehn - sommerville equations for the entries @xmath20 is that each @xmath24-index can be written as a non - commuting polynomial in @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the resulting polynomial called the _",
    "@xmath38-index _ , also denoted @xmath33 and first appeared in  @xcite . within the free non - commuting @xmath39-algebra @xmath40 in two variables @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the degree of @xmath41",
    "is set to be 1 and the degree of @xmath42 is set to be two . in this way",
    "the number of all homogeneous monomials of degree @xmath4 in @xmath41 and @xmath42 is precisely @xmath23 .",
    "hence , the @xmath38-index is the most compact way to encode all the entries of the flag vector of a polytope @xmath6 w.r.t .",
    "linear relations of the coefficients of the monomial in @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "a lot of current research is therefore directed toward understanding the @xmath38-index for polytopes .",
    "although the @xmath38-index is an elegant and compact way to encode the flag vector for a polytope @xmath6 , it can be at times difficult to handle in many explicit computations since algebraic manipulation in @xmath43 can become particularly cumbersome .",
    "the purpose of this article is to do the opposite of the above : namely , instead of attempting to compactify the encoding of the flag vector further , then we shall instead relax the constrictions and allow some redundancies among coefficients in order to facilitate direct computations .",
    "this will in certain cases allow us to write down explicit ( albeit involved ) formulae from which the entries of the flag vector can be obtained .",
    "we will define the _ flag polynomial _ for a polytope , a polynomial in commuting variables that will behave reasonably well when constructing polytopes by known methods i.e.  prisms , pyramids , products , free joins and minkowski sums .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : basic ] we present our basic definitions and write some direct consequences . in section  [ sec : flag - poly ] we state ( but do not prove ) theorem  [ thm : flag - main ] , the main result of the section ; a formula for the flag polynomial of a minkowski sum of @xmath0 standard simplices .",
    "we then parse through an explicit application of theorem  [ thm : flag - main ] and note some consequences .",
    "section  [ sec : join ] is devoted to the derivation of theorem  [ thm : p - acts - flag ] ; a formula for the flag polynomial of a polytope @xmath44 , a polytope obtained when the geometric polytope @xmath6 in @xmath45 acts on the polytopes @xmath46 .",
    "this action generalizes the notion of the free join of two polytopes .",
    "finally , we note that theorem  [ thm : flag - main ] is a corollary of theorem  [ thm : p - acts - flag ] . in the last section  [ sec : f - poly-2 ] we present two examples on the application of the flag polynomial . in the first example we compute the maximum number of faces of an arbitrary minkowski sum of two simplices . in the latter example",
    "we compute the maximum discrepancy between the number of @xmath5-chains of faces of a minkowski sum of two simplices and the number of @xmath5-chains of faces of a simple polytope of the same dimension and on the same number of vertices as the minkowski sum .",
    "this article can be viewed as a self contained continuation of  @xcite . for related references and history of the significance of minkowski sums of simplices",
