    "understanding of the physical origins and systematics underlying the variations of materials properties with size , form of aggregation , and dimensionality are some of the main challenges in modern materials research , of ever increasing importance in the face of the accelerated trend toward miniaturization of electronic and mechanical devices .",
    "@xcite    interestingly , it has emerged that concepts and methodologies developed in the context of isolated gas - phase clusters and atomic nuclei are often most useful for investigations of finite - size solid - state structures . in particular , it has been shown most recently @xcite through first - principles molecular dynamics simulations that as metallic ( sodium ) nanowires are stretched to just a few atoms in diameter , the reduced dimensions , increased surface - to - volume ratio , and impoverished atomic environment , lead to formation of structures , made of the metal atoms in the neck , which can be described in terms of those observed in small gas - phase sodium clusters ; hence they were termed @xcite as supported _ cluster - derived structures ( cds)_. the above prediction of the occurrence of `` magic - number '' cds s in nanowires , due to characteristics of electronic cohesion and atomic bonding in such structures of reduced dimensions , are directly correlated with the energetics of metal clusters , where magic - number sequences of cluster sizes , shapes and structural motifs due to electronic and/or geometric shell effects , have been long predicted and observed .",
    "@xcite    these results lead one directly to conclude that other properties of nanowires , derived from their energetics , may be described using methodologies developed previously in the context of clusters . indeed , in a previous letter , @xcite we showed that certain aspects of the mechanical response ( i.e. , elongation force ) and electronic transport ( e.g. , quantized conductance ) in metallic nanowires can be analyzed using the local - density - approximation ( lda ) -based shell correction method ( scm ) , developed and applied previously in studies of metal clusters .",
    "@xcite specifically , we showed that in a jellium - modelled , volume - conserving , and uniform in shape nanowire , variations of the total energy ( particularly terms associated with electronic subband corrections ) upon elongation of the wire lead to _ self - selection _ of a sequence of stable `` magic '' wire configurations ( mwc s , specified by a sequence of the wire s radii ) , with the force required to elongate the wire from one configuration to the next exhibiting an oscillatory behavior .",
    "moreover , we showed that due to the quantized nature of electronic states in such wires , the electronic conductance varies in a quantized step - wise manner ( in units of the conductance quantum @xmath2 ) , correlated with the transitions between mwc s and the above - mentioned force oscillations .    in this paper , we expand our lda - based treatment to wires of variable shape , that is allowing for a constricted region . from this investigation , we conclude that the above self - selection principles and the direct correlations between the oscillatory patterns in the energetic stability , forces , and stepwise variations of the quantized conductance maintain for the variable - shaped wire as well , with the finding that underlying these oscillatory patterns and correlations are the contributions from the narrowmost region of the wire .",
    "furthermore , this finding is analyzed and corroborated through a semiclassical analysis .",
    "prior to introducing the model studied in this paper , it is appropriate to briefly describe certain previous theoretical and experimental investigations , which form the background and motivation for this study .",
    "atomistic descriptions , based on realistic interatomic interactions , and/or first - principles modelling and simulations played an essential role in discovering the formation of nanowires , @xcite and in predicting and elucidating the microscopic mechanisms underlying their mechanical , spectral , electronic and transport properties .",
    "these predictions @xcite [ particularly those pertaining to generation of nanowires through separation of the contact between two materials bodies ; size - dependent evolution of the wire s mechanical response to elongation transforming from multiple - slips for wider wires to a succession of stress accumulation and fast relief stages leading to a sequence of structural instabilities and order - disorder transformations localized in the neck region when its diameter shrinks to about 15  ; consequent oscillations of the elongation force and the calculated high value of the resolved yield stress ( @xmath3 4 gpa for au nanowires ; which is over an order of magnitude that of the bulk ) , as well as anticipated electronic quantization effects on transport properties @xcite ] have been corroborated in a number of experiments using scanning tunneling and force microscopy , @xcite break junctions , @xcite and pin - plate techniques @xcite at ambient environments , as well as under ultrahigh vacuum and/or cryogenic conditions . particularly pertinent to our current study",
    "are experimental observations of the oscillatory behavior of the elongation forces and the correlations between the changes in the conductance and the force oscillations ; see especially the simultaneous measurements of force and conductance in gold nanowires in ref .",
    ", where in addition the predicted `` ideal '' value of the critical yield stress has also been measured ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "the lda - jellium - based model introduced in our previous paper @xcite and extended to generalized wire shapes herein , while providing an appropriate solution within the model s assumptions ( see section ii ) , is devoid by construction of atomic crystallographic structure and does not address issues pertaining to nanowire formation methods , atomistic configurations , and mechanical response modes [ e.g. , plastic deformation mechanisms , interplanar slip , ordering and disordering mechanisms ( see detailed descriptions in refs .   and , and a discussion of conductance dips in ref .",
    ") , defects , mechanical reversibility , @xcite and roughening of the wires s morphology during elongation @xcite ] , nor does it consider the effects of the above on the electron spectrum , transport properties , and dynamics .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , as shown below , the model offers a useful framework for linking investigations of solid - state structures of reduced dimensions ( e.g. , nanowires ) with methodologies developed in cluster physics , as well as highlighting certain nanowire phenomena of mesoscopic origins and their analogies to clusters .    in this context",
    ", we note that several other treatments related to certain of the issues in this paper , but employing free - electron models , have been pursued most recently .",
    "@xcite in both of these treatments an infinite confining potential on the surface of the wire is assumed and only the contribution from the kinetic energy of the electrons to the total energy is considered , neglecting the exchange - correlation and hartree terms , and electrostatic interactions due to the positive ionic ( jellium ) background .",
    "a comprehensive discussion of the limitations of such free - electron models in the context of calculations of electronic structure and energetics ( e.g. , surface energies ) of metal surfaces can be found in ref .   .",
    "in section ii.a . , we outline the lda - based shell correction method , describe the jellium model for variable - shaped nanowires , and derive expressions for the energetics of such nanowires ( density of states , energy , and force ) .",
    "numerical results pertaining to energetics , force , and electronic conductance , calculated as a function of elongation for variable - shaped sodium nanowires , are given in section ii.b .",
    ", including a discussion on the main finding that the contribution from the narrowmost part of the constriction underlies the properties of these quantities and the correlations between them .",
    "these correlations between the energetic and transport properties and their dependence on the narrowmost part of the nanowire are further analyzed in section iii , using a semiclassical treatment .",
    "we summarize our results in section iv .",
    "consider a jellium nanowire with circular symmetry about the axis of the wire ( @xmath4 axis ) .",
    "the wire may contain a constricted region ( see fig .  1 ) , that is a section of length @xmath5 where the cross - sectional radius @xmath6 varies along the axis as @xmath7 with @xmath8 ( the @xmath9 plane passes through the middle of the wire ) and @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is the uniform radius outside the constricted section , and @xmath12 . in this paper , we take a parabolic shape @xmath13 for the description of the constricted region [ a wire of uniform cross section throughout corresponds to @xmath14 .",

    "identification of the latter class of features ( several of which are marked by arrows ) is facilitated through comparison with the density of states for the corresponding uniform wire [ fig .",

    "these variations are also portrayed in the energetics of the wire ( shown in fig .",

    "when added to the smooth contribution , these shell - correction features lead to local minima of the total energy toward the end of the elongation ( and consequently , narrowing ) process , while for thicker wires ( i.e. , @xmath115 in fig .",
    "4 ) they are expressed as inflection points of the total energy ( in this context , see the total - force curve , @xmath116 , in fig .  5 , where the local minimum in @xmath114 corresponds to the point with @xmath117 marked by an arrow ) .",
    "we note here that the occurrence of local minima in the total energy results from a balance between @xmath57 and @xmath113 , with the latter increasing ( that is acquiring less negative values ) as the constriction elongates due to the increasing contribution from the surface of the constriction .",
    "comparison of the magnitudes of the shell corrections in a variable - shaped wire and in a uniform one [ i.e. , one with @xmath118 in eq .",
    "( [ az ] ) , whose case was discussed in ref .  ]",
    "shows that the amplitudes of the oscillations in the latter case are much larger ( over an order of magnitude ) .",
    "the reason for this difference is that in the constant - radius wire the quantization into the transverse subbands is uniform along the wire , while in the variable - shaped case the subband spectrum is different in various parts of the constriction .",
    "while the oscillatory pattern is dominated by the spectrum at the narrowmost region ( see also section iii below ) , the amplitudes are influenced by the transverse - mode spectra from other parts of the constriction .",
    "consequently , the number of local minima in the total energy , @xmath114 , ( and thus the number of wire configurations , i.e. , lengths , for which the total force , @xmath116 , vanishes ) is larger for a uniform wire than for a variable - shaped one .",
    "additionally , we suggest that for materials with relatively smaller surface energies a larger number of local minima may occur .    from the total energy , and the smooth and shell - correction contributions to it , we obtain the total `` elongation force '' ( ef ) , @xmath116 , and the corresponding components of it , @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "these results are displayed in fig .  5 , along with the conductance of the wire evaluated , in the adiabatic approximation ( i.e. , no mode mixing @xcite ) and neglecting tunneling effects ( assuming unit transmission coefficients for all the conducting modes ) , using the landauer expression , @xcite @xmath121~ , \\label{land}\\ ] ] where @xmath122 , and the spectrum of the transverse modes is evaluated ( for each constriction length ) at the narrowmost part of the constriction , @xmath9",
    ". tunneling contributions ( see e.g. , ref .  ) , mode - mixing and non - adiabaticity may affect the sharpness of the conductance steps , and/or introduce some interference related features , particularly near the transitions between the conductance plateaus .",
    "these effects , which can be included in more elaborate evaluations of the conductance , @xcite do not modify the conclusions of our study .    also included in this figure is a plot describing the variation of the minimal cross - sectional radius @xmath106 with the length of the constriction [ see eq .",
    "( [ a0 ] ) ] .    as evident from fig .  5 , the oscillations in the force resulting from the shell - correction contributions are prominent .",
    "in @xmath120 , we observe that the locations of the zeroes of the force situated at the right of the force maxima occur for values of @xmath123 which coincide with the locations of local minima in the shell - correction contribution to the energy of the wire ( i.e , for a sequence of minimal cross - sectional radii corresponding to mwc s ) . in the total force , @xmath116 , only one of these points ( where @xmath117 ) remains [ i.e. , the one corresponding to the local minimum in the total energy towards the end of the elongation process ( see fig .",
    "4 ) ] , for the reasons discussed above in connection with the energetics of the wire . nevertheless , the oscillations in the total force correlate well with those in the total energy of the wire , which as discussed above originate from the subband spectrum at the narrowmost part of the constriction ( see also section iii ) .",
    "also , the locations of the local maxima in the total force correlate with the stepwise variations in the conductance signifying the sequential decrease in the number of transverse subbands ( calculated at the narrowmost section of the wire ) below @xmath93 ( i.e. , conducting channels ) as the constricted part of the wire elongates ( and thus narrows ) . additionally , we note that the magnitude of the total force is comparable to measured ones ( i.e. , in the nanonewton range ) .",
    "the magnitude of the total force in sodium nanowires ( not measured to date ) is expected to be smaller than that found for gold nanowires , @xcite due mainly to differences in the electron densities and surface energies of the materials .",

( [ gsem ] ) ] , the direct correlation between the two is immediately evident , and both depend on the spectrum of transverse modes ( conducting channels ) at the narrowmost part of the wire .",
    "this is in agreement with the results shown in fig .",

    "in this paper , we extended our investigations @xcite of energetics , conductance , and mesoscopic forces in a jellium modelled nanowire ( sodium ) using the local - density - functional - based shell correction method to variable - shaped wires , i.e. , containing a constricted region modeled here by a parabolic dependence of the cross - sectional radii in the constriction on @xmath4 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the results shown above , particularly , the oscillations in the total energy of the wire as a function of the length of the variable - shaped constricted region ( and correspondingly its narrowmost width ) , the consequent oscillations in the elongation force , the corresponding discrete sequence of magic wire configurations , and the direct correlation between these oscillations and the stepwise quantized conductance of the nanowires , originate from quantization of the electronic states ( i.e. , formation of subbands ) due to the reduced lateral ( transverse ) dimension of the nanowires .",
    "these results are in correspondence with our earlier lda - scm investigation of jellium - modeled uniform nanowires .",
    "@xcite moreover , in the current study of a wire with a variable ( adiabatic ) shaped constriction , we found that the oscillatory behavior of the energetic and transport properties are governed by the subband quantization spectrum ( termed here electronic shells ) at the narrowmost part of the constriction .",
    "this characteristic is supported and corroborated by our semiclassical analysis ( section iii ) .",
    "we reiterate here that such oscillatory behavior , as well as the appearance of `` magic numbers '' and `` magic configurations '' of enhanced stability , are a general characteristic of finite - size fermionic systems and are in direct analogy with those found in simple - metal clusters ( as well as in @xmath0he clusters @xcite and atomic nuclei@xcite ) , where electronic shell effects on the energetics @xcite ( and most recently shape dynamics @xcite of jellium modelled clusters driven by forces obtained from shell - corrected energetics ) have been studied for over a decade .",
    "while these calculations provide a useful and instructive framework , we remark that they are not a substitute for theories where the atomistic nature and specific atomic arrangements are included @xcite in evaluation of the energetics ( and dynamics ) of these systems ( see in particular refs .",
    ", where first - principles molecular - dynamics simulations of electronic spectra , geometrical structure , atomic dynamics , electronic transport and fluctuations in sodium nanowires have been discussed ) .",
    "indeed , the atomistic structural characteristics of nanowires @xcite ( including the occurrence of cluster - derived structures of particular geometries@xcite ) , which may be observed through the use of high resolution microscopy , @xcite influence the electronic spectrum and transport characteristics , as well as the energetics of nanowires and their mechanical properties and response mechanisms . in particular , the mechanical response of materials involves structural changes through displacement and discrete rearrangenent of the atoms .",
    "the mechanisms , pathways , and rates of such structural transformations are dependent on the arrangements and coordinations of atoms , the magnitude of structural transformation barriers , and the local shape of the wire , as well as possible dependency on the history of the material and the conditions of the experiment ( i.e. , fast versus slow extensions ) .",
    "further evidence for the discrete atomistic nature of the structural transformations is provided by the shape of the force variations ( compare the calculated fig .",
    "3(b ) in ref .   and fig .  3 in ref .   with the measurements shown in figs .  1 and 2 in ref .",
    ") , and the interlayer spacing period of the force oscillations when the wire narrows .",
    "while such issues are not addressed by models which do not include the atomistic nature of the material , the mesoscopic ( in a sense universal ) phenomena described by our model are of interest , and may guide further research in the area of finite - size systems in the nanoscale regime .",
    "such further investigations include the occurrence of magic configurations ( i.e. , sequences of enhanced stability specified by number of particles , size , thickness or shape ) in clusters , dots , wires , and thin films of normal , as well as superconducting metals , and the effect of magnetic fields which can influence the energetics in such systems ( e.g. , leading to magnetostriction effects ) through variations of the subband spectra , in analogy with magnetotransport phenomena in nanowires @xcite .",
    "several directions for improving the model ( while remaining within a jellium framework ) are possible .",
    "these include : ( i ) consideration of more complex shapes .",
    "for example , in our current model the elongation is distributed over the entire constriction throughout the process , while a more realistic description should include a gradual concentration of the elongation , and consequent shape variation , to the narrower part of the constriction as found through molecular - dynamics simulations ; @xcite ( ii ) use of a stabilized - jellium description @xcite of the energetics of the nanowire in order to give it certain elements of mechanical stability . in this context ,",
    "note also that from the total energy shown in fig .",
    "4(c ) , and the corresponding total force [ fig .",
    "5(c ) ] , it is evident that in our current model , except for the region of large elongation close to the breaking point ( i.e. , @xmath165 ) , the wire is unstable against spontaneous collapse ( that is shortening ) , i.e. , there are no energetic barriers against such process , while both experiments @xcite and md simulations @xcite show that compression of such wires requires the application of an external force .",
    "improvements of the model in these directions are most desirable in light of the aforementioned experimental @xcite and md - simulations @xcite observations that the total oscillating forces for elongation and compression of nanowires are of opposite signs ( i.e. , negative and positive , respectively ) , while our current ( equilibrium model ) is limited to certain aspects of the tensile part of an elongation - compression cycle ; ( iii ) inclusion of bias voltage effects in calculations of the energetics and conductance of nanowires . @xcite",
    "while such effects may be expected to have little influence ( particularly on the energetics ) at small voltages , they could be of significance at larger ones .",

    "<S> the oscillatory patterns in the energetics and forces , and the correlated stepwise variation in the conductance are shown , numerically and through a semiclassical analysis , to be dominated by the quantized spectrum of the transverse states at the narrowmost part of the constriction in the wire .    </S>",
