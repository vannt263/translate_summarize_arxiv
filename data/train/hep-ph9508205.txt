    "the remarkably successful application of the quark  parton model in the description of deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) data over a very large kinematic domain has propelled this simple picture of the nucleon at high energies into becoming part of the common language employed by medium and high energy physicists . furthermore , the qcd - improved parton model provides a framework in which one can quantitatively understand the scaling violations seen in dis experiments in the perturbative region of large photon virtualities ( @xmath2 gev@xmath3 ) .",
    "nevertheless , what we have learned from the more recent dis data on both polarized and unpolarized targets is that even the qcd - improved parton model can not , by itself , give a complete description of the structure of the nucleon at high energies .",
    "it is unable to ( nor was it intended to ) explain the spectrum of the nucleon s non - perturbative features . here one has traditionally invoked effective degrees of freedom , for example in the form of a pionic cloud of the nucleon , to describe the long range structure of the nucleon .    a very good example of this is the deviation from the qcd - parton model prediction for the gottfried sum rule @xcite seen in the recent high - precision nmc data @xcite .",
    "the most natural explanation of this result is that there exists an excess of @xmath4 quarks over @xmath5 in the proton  something which is clearly impossible to obtain from perturbative qcd alone .",
    "a non - perturbative pionic cloud , on the other hand , offers a simple explanation of this su(2 ) flavor symmetry breaking in the proton sea @xcite .",
    "the more recent na51 drell - yan experiment @xcite also strongly suggests a suppression of the @xmath5 sea in the proton relative to the @xmath4 sea .",
    "similarly in polarized dis , the small value for the first moment of the proton s spin - dependent structure function , @xmath6 , obtained initially by the emc @xcite , and confirmed by later measurements at cern @xcite and slac @xcite , is widely interpreted as evidence of the breakdown of the simple quark  parton model of nucleon structure .",
    "the two most common interpretations of this result are that either the strange sea of the proton is significantly polarized , or that subtle anomaly effects ( perhaps in the form of highly polarized gluons ) lead to a strong violation of the ozi rule in the flavor singlet channel @xcite . the simplest way to model a polarized strange sea would be in terms of a polarized hyperon accompanying a non - perturbative cloud of kaons @xcite .",
    "dis from a @xmath7 or @xmath8 component of the nucleon would be a natural mechanism leading to a violation of the ellis - jaffe sum rule @xcite .",
    "while strongly suggesting that non - perturbative effects play an important role in nucleon dis , the results of these experiments do not rule out mechanisms other than those involving meson clouds as those responsible for the deviations of these sum rules from the parton model predictions . indeed , despite the various phenomenological successes of nucleon models which incorporate mesonic degrees of freedom , as yet there is no direct experimental evidence unambiguously pointing to the existence of a pion ( or kaon ) cloud in high energy reactions .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to identify experiments which could give clear and unique signals of the presence of mesonic degrees of freedom in nucleon dis .",
    "the role of pions in inclusive dis from nucleon has been investigated in a number of previous studies @xcite .",
    "following thomas @xcite , it was realized that upper bounds on the average pion number per nucleon could be extracted by comparing with dis data on the momentum fractions carried by sea quarks in the proton .",
    "controversy as to whether all or just part of the gottfried sum rule violation can be accounted for by the pion cloud could be resolved by obtaining a _ lower _ bound on the pion multiplicity . however , to obtain a lower bound one would need to extract a clear pionic signal from beneath the background arising from the perturbative sea .",
    "since the pion contribution to the nucleon structure function appears at relatively small bjorken @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , its signal may be submerged beneath the perturbative background",
    ". therefore it seems a formidable challenge to seek direct experimental confirmation of pionic effects in inclusive dis .",
    "the problem is worse for the case of the @xmath11 cloud since , being heavier , those contributions lie at even smaller @xmath9 .    the pertinent question to ask",
    "is whether pions leave any unique traces at all in other processes , which can not be understood in terms of perturbative quark and gluon degrees of freedom alone .",
    "recently in the literature several suggestions have been made regarding the measurement of the pion cloud in other experiments .",
    "pirner and povh @xcite have proposed to identify the size of the constituent quark ",
    "pion vertex through exclusive leptoproduction of fast pions in the current fragmentation region .",
    "dieperink and pollock @xcite have argued that one could obtain information on the @xmath12 form factor in dis from a @xmath13 nucleus by detecting the recoiling @xmath13 nucleus in the final state . in the present paper",
    "we propose a series of analogous experiments in semi - inclusive dis on polarized protons , where a hadron is detected in the final state in coincidence with the scattered electron @xcite .",
    "we will demonstrate that dis from the nucleon s pion cloud ( fig.1 ) does in fact give rise to rather characteristic fragmentation distributions in comparison with the predictions of parton model hadronization .",
    "these differences are significantly enhanced when initial and final state polarization effects are considered .",
    "we focus on semi - inclusive production of polarized @xmath0 baryons from a polarized proton , @xmath14 .",
    "because the @xmath6 structure function of a pion is zero , an unpolarized electron beam will suffice for this purpose .",
    "the choice of the @xmath0 for the final state baryon , rather than , say , a nucleon , reduces the backgrounds that one would have to consider due to the decay of @xmath15s themselves . furthermore , the decay products of @xmath16 or @xmath17 would include neutral hadrons whose detection would be more difficult , thus increasing the overall experimental uncertainties . for the case of the @xmath11 cloud ,",
    "the relevant reaction to observe is @xmath18 . determining the polarization of the @xmath1 hyperon is considerably easier because the @xmath1 is self - analyzing .    in the next section we outline the basic kinematics pertinent to semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering . in section",
    "iii we present the predictions for the polarization asymmetries in the pion cloud model of the nucleon .",
    "a condensed summary of the results in this section can also be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "possible backgrounds to the pionic signal are analyzed in section iv . in section v the strangeness content of the nucleon is studied in the @xmath11 cloud and diquark fragmentation models .",
    "a brief overview of other experiments suggested recently to measure the pion cloud of the nucleon is given in section vi , while section vii is reserved for some concluding remarks .",
    "experimentally it is known that the yield of baryons is about one order of magnitude higher in the backward hemisphere of the @xmath19 center of mass frame ( `` target fragmentation region '' ) than for forward hemisphere baryons ( `` current fragmentation region '' ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , baryons produced by current fragmentation have predominantly large momenta in the target rest frame ( @xmath20 several gev ) , while those in the backward center of mass jet are generally slow . since our concern here is with low momentum baryons ( @xmath15s and @xmath1s ) produced in the target fragmentation region , we shall neglect the quark @xmath21 baryon fragmentation process which gives rise to the forward baryons .    for studies of the spin dependence of the fragmentation process",
    ", we require the target proton polarization to be parallel to the photon direction , with the spin of the produced baryon quantized along its direction of motion .",
    "experimentally , the polarization of the produced @xmath22 can be reconstructed from the angular distribution of its decay products ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) , while because it is self - analyzing , polarization of the @xmath1 can be determined automatically .    with the high luminosity beam available at cebaf , for example",
    ", the rate of @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) production will generally be high .",
    "even though the efficiency with which low momentum baryons can be accurately identified is lower than for fast baryons in the forward center of mass hemisphere @xcite , their detection will still be feasible , for example with the cebaf large acceptance spectrometer .",
    "alternatively , with polarized internal targets soon available at hermes , one could also in principle perform this experiment there provided the @xmath25 detectors will be capable of capturing slow moving baryons as well as the fast mesons , which will be the focus of the first stage of the hermes program .",
    "such a program would also be ideally suited for the proposed european electron facility , elfe , or the new hadron muon collaboration at cern , which will be designed specifically for semi - inclusive measurements .",
    "we define our variables in the target rest frame as follows : @xmath26 are the four - momentum vectors of the initial and final leptons ; @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 are the momentum vectors of the target proton and recoil baryon , respectively ; and @xmath31 denotes the photon four - momentum , defined to lie along the positive @xmath32-axis . then @xmath33 is the energy transferred to the target , @xmath34 is the fractional energy transfer relative to the incident energy , and @xmath35is minus the four - momentum squared of the virtual photon , with @xmath36 . with the possible",
    "cebaf upgrade to @xmath3710 gev , values of @xmath380.14 can be reached in the deep - inelastic region for @xmath39 gev and @xmath40 gev@xmath3 , corresponding to a center of mass energy squared of the @xmath19 system of @xmath41 gev@xmath3 . at hermes , with a 30 gev electron beam , one will comfortably probe the @xmath42 region , which is relevant for the pionic contribution , up to @xmath43 gev@xmath3 and @xmath44 gev@xmath3 .",
    "the four - momentum transfer squared between the proton and baryon is @xmath45,which is bounded from above by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 , @xmath48  is the light - cone fraction of the target proton s momentum carried by the baryon , and @xmath49 is the recoiling baryon s mass . in terms of @xmath50 , the three - momentum of the produced baryon",
    "is given by : @xmath51 so that in the target rest frame the slowest baryons are those for which @xmath50 is maximized , which occurs when @xmath52 .",
    "as the upper limit on @xmath53 is @xmath54 , slow baryon production also corresponds to the @xmath55 limit , and the slowest possible particles produced at @xmath56 ( at @xmath57 ) will have momentum @xmath58 mev for @xmath59 , and @xmath60 mev for @xmath61 . for the pion - exchange process considered here , the peak in the differential cross section occurs at @xmath62 mev , which , for @xmath63 , corresponds to a missing mass of @xmath64 gev@xmath3 for @xmath65 gev@xmath3 at cebaf energies , and @xmath66 gev@xmath3 for @xmath67 gev@xmath3 at hermes .    in terms of the polar angle @xmath68 ( in the target rest",
    "frame ) , @xmath69 between the @xmath70 and @xmath71 momenta , production of baryons will occur between @xmath72 and @xmath73 which for @xmath52 is @xmath74 for @xmath59 and @xmath75 for @xmath61 .    for a given angle @xmath68 ,",
    "the pion four - momentum will be constrained to lie within the limits given by : @xmath76 at small angles baryons will be produced over essentially the entire range of @xmath50 ( and therefore @xmath53 ) , however the number will fall off rapidly as @xmath77 because of the fast convergence of the upper and lower bounds on @xmath50 , until no particles are produced beyond the kinematic boundary at @xmath78 @xmath79 .",
    "the importance of the above kinematic limits was demonstrated in two experiments @xcite in which slow proton production was studied in @xmath80-nucleon and @xmath80-nucleus scattering .",
    "the softening of the cross section for protons with momentum less than @xmath81 ( equal to several hundred mev in the experiments ) , was shown @xcite to be precisely due to the absence of interactions at @xmath82 , where@xmath83 .",
    "the role of pions was also investigated in this process , however due to the large perturbative sea component of the nucleon structure function at @xmath84 , no definite pionic signal could be identified .",
    "we may hope , however , that by including polarization degrees of freedom we can more efficiently isolate any pionic signal from behind the fragmentation background .",
    "the pion model is a dynamical model of the nucleon where the dissociation of a physical nucleon into a pion and an `` undressed '' nucleon or @xmath15 is explicitly witnessed by the probing photon .",
    "the possible relevance of the process illustrated in fig.1 , where a @xmath85 emitted by the proton is hit by a photon , to dis was recognized some time ago @xcite , and has since had several important and interesting applications , most notably in providing a mechanism to break su(2 ) and su(3 ) flavor symmetries in the proton sea . in the pion - exchange model",
    "the differential cross section is : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the lepton tensor , and @xmath88 describes the @xmath89 vertex , with @xmath90 denoting the virtual pion four - momentum .",
    "the quantity @xmath91 is the amplitude for a nucleon of spin @xmath92 to emit a pion of four - momentum squared @xmath50 , leaving a @xmath15 with spin @xmath93 .    since in the final analysis we will be dealing with lorentz - invariant cross sections as a function of the lorentz - scalars @xmath9 and @xmath53 ,",
    "we can , without loss of generality , formulate the problem in any frame which will simplify the analysis .",
    "here we note that factorization of the @xmath94 cross section into @xmath95 and @xmath96 ( or @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) cross sections does not hold in all frames of reference @xcite . indeed , such factorization , or convolution , can only be achieved by eliminating antiparticle degrees of freedom , which can formally be done only in the infinite momentum frame ( imf ) or on the light - cone @xcite .",
    "therefore for the @xmath99 form factor in eq.([ope5 ] ) we take the form suggested in earlier imf studies of the pionic content of the proton in inclusive dis @xcite :    @xmath100    where @xmath101 . since the form factor in the imf is not yet very well constrained , other forms for its shape @xcite",
    "are also possible ( it has been suggested in ref.@xcite to use semi - inclusive @xmath102 scattering data as a means of obtaining an upper bound on @xmath1 , although here one also has to deal with contributions from competing reggeized meson exchanges @xcite ) .",
    "however , the precise shape of the form factor is not important here , since , as we shall see , the bulk of the effect is given entirely by the proton  pion spin correlations . indeed , covariant formulations with @xmath50-dependent form factors @xcite : @xmath103    give very similar results to those with the @xmath104-dependent forms in eq.([ff ] ) .",
    "the formulation in the imf also allows one to use the on - mass - shell structure function of the pion in eq.([wpi ] ) @xcite , without the need to model the extrapolation of the off - shell pion structure function into the @xmath105 region @xcite .",
    "( although , in principle , there could be effects in the virtual pion structure function due to the off - energy - shell dependence . ) for the pion structure function we use therefore the most recent parametrization @xcite of data extracted from drell - yan experiments @xcite .",
    "the main uncertainty in the covariant calculation is in fact the off - mass - shell extrapolation of the virtual pion structure function , for which there still does not exist consensus in the literature @xcite .",
    "the @xmath99 coupling constant , @xmath106 , in eq.([ope5 ] ) is the physical coupling constant , defined at the pion pole ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "note that there is no renormalization factor , @xmath108 , multiplying the pion - exchange cross section , as has been used recently in refs.@xcite .",
    "this factor , which to first order in @xmath106 is written @xmath109 , with the pion number @xmath110 being essentially the integrated cross section in eq.([ope5 ] ) , is usually introduced to normalize the total nucleon inclusive cross section in the presence of pions @xcite . for the physical , semi - inclusive process , however , its use would lead to an artificial suppression of the pion - exchange contribution , especially when the form factor is hard .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite also use convolution formulae within a covariant framework , which , as mentioned above , inherently makes use of the assumption of factorization as well as the @xmath111-independence of the off - shell pion structure function , the justification of which has not yet been demonstrated .",
    "the function @xmath112 in eq.([ope5 ] ) is obtained by evaluating the trace over the target nucleon spinor and the rarita - schwinger spinor - vector @xmath113 for the recoil @xmath15 : @xmath114 ( p - p)^{\\alpha } ( p - p)^{\\beta},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xcite    @xmath115    is constructed from the spin-1/2 dirac spinor @xmath116 and spin-1 vectors @xmath117 , and normalized such that @xcite : @xmath118 @xmath119    because it is emitted collinearly with the pion , production of @xmath15 baryons with helicity @xmath120 is forbidden , which leads to the selection rule : @xmath121 this is confirmed by explicit evaluation of the trace if we recall that for polarized fermion spinors the spin projection is @xmath122 .",

    "firstly , interference from quasi - elastic @xmath0 production will be eliminated by charge conservation .",

    "a measurement of this ratio would thus be particularly useful in testing the relevance of non - perturbative degrees of freedom in high energy processes .",
    "semi - inclusive leptoproduction of polarized @xmath1 hyperons from polarized protons can also be used to test the relevance of a kaon cloud in the nucleon , fig.5 .",
    "the advantage of detecting @xmath1s in the final state , as compared with @xmath15 baryons lies in the fact that the @xmath1 is self - analyzing .",
    "it has , in fact , been suggested recently ( see ref.@xcite ) that measurement of the polarization of the @xmath1 in the target fragmentation region could discriminate between models of the spin content of the nucleon , in which a large fraction of the spin is carried either by ( negatively polarized ) strange quarks or ( positively polarized ) gluons .",
    "the latter would imply a positive correlation of the target proton and @xmath1 spins , while the spin projection of the @xmath1 along the target polarization axis should be negative in the former model .",
    "( similar effects would also be seen in the reaction @xmath228 @xcite . )",
    "a kaon cloud would be the natural way to obtain a polarized strange sea of the proton .    although some data do exist for @xmath1 production in the region @xmath189 @xcite",
    ", the large errors and limited range of @xmath182 do not permit one to unambiguously discern the presence of @xmath11 effects .",
    "a direct test of the presence of a kaon cloud of the nucleon would be to observe the differential @xmath1 production cross section at large @xmath53 , and in particular the relative polarization yields .",
    "the formalism for the dis off the kaon cloud @xcite is very similar to that for the pion exchange model in section iii .",
    "included in the observed @xmath1 cross section will be contributions from direct @xmath1 production via @xmath229 exchange , as well as those from @xmath230 recoil states , which subsequently decay to @xmath231 .",
    "the differential hyperon @xmath232 ( @xmath233 ) production cross section is similar to that in eq.([ope5 ] ) , with the trace factor here given by : @xmath234 using the rest frame parametrizations of the individual momentum and spin vectors , we find for a proton initially polarized in the positive @xmath32 direction : @xmath235    the @xmath1 production cross section is shown in fig.6 , as a function of @xmath53 , for the two possible polarizations ( the kinematics are as in fig.2a ) .",
    "the @xmath11-exchange predictions are calculated for the form factor in eq.([ff ] ) with cut - offs of @xmath236 ( smallest ) , 0.8 and 1.0 gev ( largest ) .",
    "the @xmath11-exchange model predicts very strong correlations between the target and recoil polarizations , so that the asymmetry shown in fig.7 for the cross sections @xmath237 , where @xmath238 , is almost unity .",
    "the @xmath11-exchange ratios are very similar to the @xmath226-exchange results in fig.4 , indicating the similar spin transfer dynamics inherent in the meson cloud picture of the nucleon .",
    "this is in strong contrast with the expectation from the @xmath239 diquark fragmentation picture , in which the target  recoil spin correlation is much weaker .",
    "in fact , to a first approximation the @xmath240 yields in the quark - parton model are equal . assuming an su(6 ) symmetric wave function for the @xmath1 , namely @xmath241 ,",
    "the leading fragmentation function will be @xmath242 , so that the relevant component of the su(6 ) proton wave function is @xmath243 . since one has equal probabilities to form a @xmath244 and @xmath245 , in the leading fragmentation approximation the asymmetry will be zero .",
    "of course , su(6 ) symmetry breaking effects , as well as non - leading fragmentation contributions , will modify this result , as will contributions from the production and decay of @xmath246 hyperons ( from the su(6 ) wave function one can see that a @xmath247 is more likely to form from a @xmath158 than is a @xmath248 ) .",
    "however , the qualitative result that the asymmetry is small should remain true .",
    "therefore the observation of a large polarization asymmetry in the large-@xmath53 region of the target fragmentation region will be evidence for a kaon - exchange fragmentation mechanism .",
    "in addition to the above described process which may be tested in upcoming experiments , several other novel ideas have been proposed to identify a pionic component of the nucleon wave function . in this section",
    "we will briefly outline a couple of them .      in a recent detailed analysis @xcite , it has been suggested that measurements of fast pions in the final state in coincidence with the final electron could be sensitive to a pionic component of the nucleon . extending the exclusive analysis of gttner et al .",
    "@xcite in the imf , pirner and povh @xcite work within a constituent quark picture in which the probability to find a pion in the nucleon is expressed in terms of the pion distribution function inside a constituent quark .",
    "the differential pion - production cross section for the `` leading pion '' ( integrated over transverse momenta ) is written as : @xmath249 where @xmath250 is the fraction of the photon s energy carried by the pion , and where the @xmath251 and @xmath70 terms describe soft and hard fragmentation , respectively .",
    "the function @xmath252 reflects coherent scattering from the pion cloud of the constituent quark .",
    "each term in eq.([piprod ] ) gives a characteristic @xmath146-dependence , namely @xmath253 , @xmath254 and @xmath255 , respectively . to isolate the coherent scattering from the pion one therefore has to restrict oneself to the a region of not too high @xmath146 , where the form factor suppression has not yet eliminated the pion signal .",
    "the useful observation in this analysis is that each of the three processes has a quite distinct @xmath32-dependence .",
    "the hard - fragmentation process gives a differential cross section which is constant in @xmath32 , and is important in the intermediate @xmath32 region ( @xmath256 ) .",
    "the soft fragmentation mechanism is dominant at small @xmath32 , @xmath257 , but dies out rather rapidly at larger @xmath32 .",
    "this fact may enable one to detect the pion - exchange process , which dominates the region @xmath258 , where it predicts a contribution that is several times larger than the constant-@xmath32 , hard fragmentation mechanism .",
    "the conclusion that the pion - exchange process is dominant is consistent with our results above .",
    "another novel idea was recently put forward by dieperink and pollock @xcite , where the suggestion was to measure the recoiling @xmath13 nucleus in deep - inelastic scattering from a @xmath13 target at @xmath259 . unlike the exclusive experiments , one would not need to restrict oneself to the small @xmath146 region .",
    "because of the rather small probability for the nucleus to remain intact after a hard interaction with a parton in one of the constituent nucleons , backgrounds due to parton fragmentation would be virtually eliminated .",
    "therefore the most likely mechanism responsible for the final state @xmath13 nucleus would be dis from a non - nucleonic component in the target , the typical candidate being a pion .",
    "other non - nucleonic constituents could also give rise to the same final state , such as dis from a pomeron in the diffractive region .",
    "however , in practice these could be eliminated by restricting oneself to the specific kinematic region of not too small @xmath9 .",
    "an additional problem here in obtaining unambiguous information about the @xmath260 vertex from the @xmath261 vertex would be nuclear effects in the @xmath13 nucleus .",
    "furthermore , any final state interactions , leading to the break up of the @xmath13 nucleus , could decrease the apparent number of pions seen in the reaction , thus leading to an underestimate of the pion multiplicity in the nucleon .",
    "nevertheless , this is an interesting idea , and a detailed study should be performed with a view to determining the feasibility of conducting this experiment in future .",
    "we have outlined a series of semi - inclusive experiments on polarized proton targets that may for the first time enable one to unambiguously establish the presence of a pion and kaon cloud of the nucleon at high energies .",
    "the most difficult part of the calculation is the estimate of the size of the competing diquark fragmentation process .",
    "while we have used as much experimental data and theoretical guidance as possible , in order to make that calculation reliable , it could undoubtedly benefit from further study into the polarized diquark @xmath21 polarized baryon fragmentation process . even bearing this caution in mind ,",
    "our results ( especially figs.4 and 7 ) are extremely encouraging .",
    "while the experiments proposed here are difficult , requiring all the intensity and duty factor one can obtain with modern electron accelerators , it does seem that they will provide quite clear information on the role of the pseudoscalar mesons in the nucleon .",
