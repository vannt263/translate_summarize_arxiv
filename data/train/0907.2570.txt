    "in general relativity , there are two famous conjectures concerning the gravitational collapse .",
    "one is the cosmic censorship conjecture @xcite which states collapse driven singularities will always be clothed by an event horizon and hence can never be visible from the outside .",
    "the other is the hoop conjecture @xcite which states that black - holes will form when and only when a mass @xmath2 gets compacted into a region whose circumference @xmath3 in every direction is @xmath4 .",
    "these two conjectures have been extensively studied in various methods , among them we believe the numerical works by shapiro and teukolsky @xcite showed the most exciting results ; ( a tendency of ) the appearance of a naked singularity .",
    "this was reported from the fully relativistic time evolution of collisionless particles in a highly prolate initial shape ; and the results of time evolutions are agree with the predictions of the sequence of their initial data @xcite .    in recent years , on the other hand , gravitation in higher - dimensional spacetime is getting a lot of attention .",
    "this is from an attempt to unify fundamental forces including gravity at tev scale , and if so , it is suggested that small black - holes might be produced at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the lhc experiments are expected to validate several higher - dimensional gravitational models . in such an exciting situation ,",
    "the thoretical interests are also in the general discussion of black - hole structures .",
    "our discussion is one of them : in what circumstances black - holes are formed ?",
    "new features of higher - dimensional black - holes and black - objects are reported due to additional physical freedoms .",
    "the four - dimensional black - holes are known to be @xmath5 from the topological theorem .",
    "also in the asymptotically flat and stationary space - time , four - dimensional black - holes are known to be the kerr black - hole from the uniqueness theorem . on the other hand , in higher - dimensional spacetime , quite rich structures are available , such as a torus black - hole (  black ring \" ) with @xmath1 horizon @xcite or black saturn @xcite , black di - ring@xcite ( see a review @xcite for references ) .",
    "the uniqueness theorem of axisymmetric spacetime in higher - dimension is known to be violated .",
    "so far , the black - hole studies in higher - dimensional spacetime are mainly proceeding using analytic stationary solutions",
    ". there are also many numerical attempts to seek the higher - dimensional black - hole structures ; e.g. collider - oriented dynamical features @xcite , a new stationary solution sequence @xcite , ( here we selected the works with asymptotically flat spacetime ) .",
    "however , fully relativistic dynamical features , such as the formation processes , stabilities , and late - time fate of the black - objects are left unknown .",
    "we plan to investigate such dynamical processes numerically , and this is the first report on the constructions of the sequences of initial data for time evolution .",
    "the hoop conjecture tries to denote  if \" and  only if \" conditions for the formation of the horizon in the process of gravitational collapse . the  only if \" part of the statement would be replaced with the so - called gibbons - penrose isoperimetric inequality @xcite , @xmath6 , where @xmath2 is the total mass and @xmath7 is the area of the trapped surface . this inequality is based on the cosmic censorship conjecture , so that its proof or disproof is the important issue ( see a precise formulation in @xcite and a recent review @xcite ) .",
    "the higher dimensional versions of the hoop conjecture and the isoperimetric inequality have been discussed so far @xcite .",
    "while there are differences in their coefficiencies , the hoop conjecture in @xmath8-dimensional spacetime would be basically expressed as follows : a black - hole with horizons form when and only when a mass @xmath2 gets compacted into a region whose @xmath9-dimensional area @xmath10 in every direction is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the gravitational constant in @xmath8-dimensional theory of gravity . here",
    "@xmath10 means the volume of @xmath9-dimensional closed submanifold of a spacelike hypersurface .",
    "that is , the hoop @xmath3 in four - dimensional space - time is replaced with the _ hyper - hoop _ @xmath10 ; if @xmath13 , then the _ hyper - hoop _ would be an area @xmath14 .",
    "however , in five - dimensional spacetime , black - holes are not restricted to have a simply - connected horizon , therefore the applicabilities of the hyper - hoop and the isoperimetric inequality to various black - objects are left unknown .",
    "the validity of ( [ 1.1 ] ) was investigated in several idealized models by ida and nakao @xcite and yoo et al .",
    "@xcite , who solved momentarily static , conformally flat , five - dimensional axisymmetric homogeneous spheroidal matter and @xmath15-function type ring matter .",
    "our purpose is to investigate the generality of the hyper - hoop conjecture and the cosmic censorship conjecture in more general situations .    in this article , we present two kinds of initial data ; spheroidal and toroidal matter configurations .",
    "we solve the hamiltonian constraint equation numerically , and then search apparent horizons .",
    "this study is the generalization of @xcite and @xcite ; we reproduce their results as our code checks , and present also finite - sized ring cases .",
    "the definition of the hyper - hoop is not yet definitely given in the community , so that we propose to define the hyper - hoop as a local minimum of the area by solving the euler - lagrange type equation .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we explain how to set initial data for five - dimensional space - time and how to search @xmath0 and @xmath1 apparent horizons and hoops . in sec .",
    "iii , we show numerical results .",
    "the final section is devoted to the summary and discussion .",
    "we use the unit @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the speed of light , @xmath19 is the gravitational constant of the five - dimensional spacetime .",
    "we consider the initial data sequences on a four - dimensional space like hypersurface .",
    "a solution of the einstein equations is obtained by solving the hamiltonian constraint equation if we assume the moment of time symmetry .",
    "we apply the standard conformal approach@xcite to obtain the four - metric @xmath20 . as was discussed in @xcite , in @xmath21 space - time decomposition ,",
    "the equations would be simplified with a conformal transformation , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the trial base metric which we assume conformally flat , @xmath24    the hamiltonian constraint equation , then , becomes @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the effective newtonian mass density , @xmath27 is the gravitational constant in five - dimensional theory of gravity .",
    "we numerically solve eq.([hamiltonian ] ) in the upper - half coordinate region ( @xmath28 ) with setting the boundary conditions as @xmath29 and , @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be interpreted as the adm mass of the matter .",

    "the presenting results are the sequences of the constant @xmath32 within the error o(@xmath52 ) .",
    "we model the matter by non - rotating homogeneous spheroidal and toroidal configurations with effective newtonian uniform mass density .",
    "our first model is the cases with homogeneous spheroidal matter , which are expressed as @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are parameters .",
    "this is the @xmath21 dimensional version of the earlier study of nakamura et al .",
    "@xcite , and also the numerical reproduction of ida - nakao @xcite and yoo et al .",
    "@xcite .",

    "nevertheless we consider this is the first step for toroidal configuration , since this is the generalization of @xcite to the finite - sized matter cases .",
    "after obtaining the initial data , we evaluate the kretchmann invariant , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the four - dimensional riemann tensor , in order to measure the strength of gravity .",

    "first , we show the cases with spheroidal matter configurations . in figure 2 , we display matter distributions and the shape of the apparent horizon ( if it exists ) . when the matter is spherical , @xmath117 @xmath35the cases of ( a ) , ( d ) in fig.2@xmath36 $ ] , the horizon is also spherically symmetric and locates at the schwarzschild radius , @xmath118 .",
    "the horizon becomes prolate as the value @xmath119 increases .",
    "we can not find the apparent horizon when length @xmath55 is larger than @xmath120 for @xmath121 and @xmath122 for @xmath123 .",
    "we see from ( b ) and ( e ) of fig.2 that the matter configurations can be arbitrarily large but the apparent horizon does not cover all the matter regions . this behavior is the same with @xmath124 dimensional cases @xcite and our numerical results reproduce the results in @xcite . if we compare our 5-dimensional results with 4-dimensional ones ( ref.[4 ] ) , the disappearance of the apparent horizon can be seen only for the highly prolate cases .",
    "( e.g. , for the eccentricity 0.999 cases , the disappearance of the apparent horizon starts at the prolate radius 0.7 @xmath2 in 4-dimensional case , while 2.0 @xmath118 in our case . )",
    "therefore we expect that an appearance of a singular behaviour is  relaxed \" in 5-dimensional case , and this tendency would be the same for the higher - dimensional cases .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     we show the surface area of the apparent horizons @xmath88 in fig.[a2 ] . in fig.[a2 ] , typical two horizon monotonically decrease with @xmath125 , the largest one is when the matter is in the spheroidal one ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "we also observe that the common - horizon area is always larger than @xmath1 horizon area and two are smoothly connected in the plot .",
    "if we took account the analogy of the thermodynamics of black - hole , this may suggest that if the black - ring evolves to shrink its circle radius then the ring horizon will switch to the common horizon at a certein radius .",
    "fig.[hh2 ] shows the hyper - hoop @xmath107 , @xmath109 , and @xmath114 for these matter configurations .",
    "we plot the points where we found hyper - hoops .",
    "we note that @xmath127 is the switching radius from the common apparent horizon to the ring apparent horizon , and that @xmath107 and @xmath109 are sufficiently smaller than unity if there is a common apparent horizon",
    ". therefore , eq.([sufficient_condition ] ) is satisfied for the formation of common horizon . on the other hand , for the ring horizon",
    ", we should consider the hoop @xmath114 in eq.([sufficient_condition ] ) . in fig.[hh2 ] , in the region @xmath128 , @xmath114 exists only a part in this region and becomes larger than unity .",
    "hence , for @xmath1 apparent horizon , the hyper - hoop conjecture , ( [ sufficient_condition ] ) , is not a proper indicator .",
    "we conclude that the hyper - hoop conjecture , ( [ sufficient_condition ] ) , is only consistent with the formation of common horizon in toroidal case as far as our definition of the hyper - hoop is concerned .",
    "with the purpose of investigating the fully relativistic dynamics of five - dimensional black - objects , we constructed sequences of initial data and discussed the formation of the apparent horizons , the area of the horizons , and the validity of the hoop conjecture .",
    "we modeled the matter in two cases ; non - rotating homogeneous spheroidal shape , and toroidal shape under the momentarily static assumption .",
    "two models are still highly simplified ones , but the results are well agreed with the previous semi - analytic works ( both with 3 + 1 and 4 + 1 dimensional studies ) and we also obtained new sequences for finite - sized matter rings .",
    "we examined the so - called _ hyper - hoop _ conjecuture , where the hoop is the _ area _ in 4 + 1 dimensional version .",
    "we defined the hyper - hoop @xmath14 as it satisfies @xmath129 , and searched the hoops numerically .",
    "for the spheroidal matter cases , our results are simply the extensions of the previous studies .",
    "the horizon is not formed when the matter is highly thin - shaped , the hyper - hoop conjecture using our @xmath14 is properly satisfied , and the maximum of the kretchmann invariant @xmath130 appears at the outside of the matter .",
    "as was shown in the 3 + 1 dimensional case @xcite , this suggests also the formation of a naked singularity when we start time evolution from this initial data .    while for the toroidal matter cases",
    ", both horizons and hoops can take two topologies , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , so that we considered both .",
    "the apparent horizon is observed to switch from the common horizon ( @xmath0 ) to the ring horizon ( @xmath1 ) at a certain circle radius , and the former satisfies the hyper - hoop conjecture , while the latter is not .",
    "this is somewhat plausible , since the hoop conjecture was initially proposed only for the 3 + 1 dimensional gravity where only the simply - connected black - hole is allowed .    from the area of the horizon and from the thermo - dynamical analogy of black holes",
    ", we might predict the dynamical feature of the black - ring . as we showed in fig.[a2 ] , the common horizon has larger area than the ring horizon , so that if the dynamics proceed to shrink its circle radius , then a black - ring will naturally switch to a single black - hole .",
    "however , if the local gravity is strong , then the ring might begin collapsing to a ring singularity , that might produce also to the formation of ` naked ring ' since @xmath130 appears on the outside of the ring ( actually double - rings , both on the top and the bottom of matter may be formed ) for a certain initial configuration .",
    "this is still a speculation and requires full dynamics in the future .",
    "the initial - data sequences we showed here do not include rotations in matter and space - time , which is one of our next subjects .",
    "we now began studying the generalization of our models including the known exact solutions , that we hope to report elsewhere soon .",
    "we are also developing our code to follow the dynamical processes in five - dimensional spacetime , there we expect to show the validity of the cosmic censorship and hyper - hoop conjecture for various black objects .",
