    "pyragas introduced an alternative in which the perturbation is proportional to the first difference of the system value ( difference between current and previous values ) , and therefore does not depend on the unstable fixed point.@xcite this delayed feedback control ( dfc ) method successfully controls chaotic behavior in a variety of cases.@xcite here we apply dfc to a chaotic finite difference return map and derive the mathematical form of the transient response and verify it experimentally with an analog electronic circuit .",
    "the system whose chaotic behavior is to be stabilized is a 1-dimensional finite difference map for system value @xmath0 with system parameter @xmath1 @xmath2 stabilization is accomplished using dfc by perturbing parameter @xmath1 by an amount proportional to the first difference , @xmath3 .",
    "thus when stabilization is turned on we have a system of two first order nonlinear finite difference equations    [ eq : system ] @xmath4    @xmath5 is the gain for the feedback that perturbs system parameter @xmath6 from @xmath1 .",
    "the first difference can be written in terms of the error term @xmath7 where the error is @xmath8 and the fixed point is @xmath9 .",
    "thus dfc has the desired property of the perturbation vanishing when the system value attains the fixed value .",

    "we perform a linear stability analysis to determine the conditions for stabilization of the chaotic behavior and to calculate the form of the transient response .",
    "the control algorithm is implemented in an analog electronic circuit .",
    "measurements from the circuit compare well with predictions .",
    "a variety of transient responses are found depending on the gain of the feedback .",
    "some show a steady convergence of the system value to the fixed value , while other cases appear to converge somewhat erratically .",
    "the behaviors are distinctly different from the transient responses obtained when using spf control based on the error @xmath11 .",
    "the electronic circuit provides a real - world system for testing implementation of the control algorithm .",
    "here we do linear stability analysis in order to determine the conditions under which chaotic behavior can be stabilized and we find the form of the transient response when stabilization is turned on .",
    "we use the first difference @xmath12 as our variable of interest since the perturbation of system parameter @xmath6 is @xmath13",

    "we point out that knowledge of the fixed point is required to evaluate the partial derivatives .",
    "however during the attempt to control chaotic behavior it is not necessary to monitor and update a potentially drifting fixed point , as long as the partial derivatives do not change too much . in contrast , a feedback method based on the difference from the system value to the fixed point requires monitoring and updating if the system s fixed point can drift .",
    "the trace and determinant of the jacobian are @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",

    "we are interested in situations when the fixed point is unstable , so @xmath22 .",

    "this is reasonable since the error @xmath110 can be expected to typically be about half of the first difference @xmath111 , so that the spf method needs a gain about twice that of the dfc gain in order to get a similar perturbation @xmath97 .",
    "we have shown that there are a variety of transient responses when applying delayed feedback control to a chaotic system governed by a finite difference 1-dimensional map .",

    "knowledge of this variety is important in situations in which the system s response to application of a control algorithm is being closely monitored since erratic and non - steady convergence could be mistaken for a faulty control mechanism .",
