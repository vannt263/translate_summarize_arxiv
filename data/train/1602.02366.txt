    "<S> achievable degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) of the _ large - scale _ interfering two - way relay network is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the network consists of @xmath0 pairs of communication nodes ( cns ) and @xmath1 relay nodes  ( rns ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is assumed that @xmath2 and each pair of cns communicates with each other through one of the @xmath1 relay nodes without a direct link between them . </S>",
    "<S> interference among rns is also considered . </S>",
    "<S> assuming local channel state information  ( csi ) at each rn , a distributed and opportunistic rn selection technique is proposed for the following three promising relaying protocols : amplify  forward , decode  forward , and compute  forward . as a main result </S>",
    "<S> , the asymptotically achievable dof is characterized as @xmath1 increases for the three relaying protocols . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , a sufficient condition on @xmath1 required to achieve the certain dof of the network is analyzed . through extensive simulations </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that the proposed rn selection techniques outperform conventional schemes in terms of achievable rate even in practical communication scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> note that the proposed technique operates with a distributed manner and requires only local csi , for practical wireless systems .    </S>",
