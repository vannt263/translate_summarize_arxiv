    "( 2000 ) investigated the effects of clumping and the presence of stars embedded in dust clumps on the total / surface photometry of disks , but only for the v band .",

    "conversely , clumps have a doubly exponential distribution and decreasing extinction optical depths as a function of the galactocentric distance in the models of kuchinski et al . ( 1998 ) and matthews & woods ( 2001 ) . on the other hand , matthews & woods considered , in addition to the diffuse dust distribution , a two - phase , clumpy dust distribution where the clumps have a smaller filling factor and a lower density contrast than those assumed here .",
    "they also made computations for b , r , h , and k bands and for edge - on disks only .",
    "finally , this study complements also the analytical description of radiative transfer presented by tuffs et al .",
    "in fact , these authors describe the dependence of the attenuation function on the hubble type , the inclination , and the total dust mass of a late - type galaxy , for 12 wavelengths ranging from 0.091 to 2.2 @xmath0 .",
    "they consider a dust - less stellar bulge , a disk of old stars with associated diffuse dust plus a thin disk of young stars with associated diffuse dust , and a clumpy dust component associated with star - forming regions in the thin disk ( e.g. silva et al . 1998 ) .",
    "their description of the clumpiness approximates the star - forming regions with porous spheres , where the local absorption of photons is given by geometry ( the solid angle of a parent cloud subtended at an offspring star of given age ) , since the optical depths of the individual clouds are assumed to be extremely large at all wavelengths .",
    "furthermore , tuffs et al .",
    "( 2004 ) adopt values of the albedo and , especially , the scattering phase function asymmetry parameter for milky way - type dust that are sensitively different from those adopted here ( witt & gordon 200 ) .",
    "for the calculations presented in this paper we employed the dirty radiative transfer code ( gordon et al .",
    "the code applies to any arbitrary spatial distribution of stars and dust .",
    "here we consider its application to the bulge and disk components of late - type galaxies separately .",
    "with monte carlo techniques ( witt 1977 ; audic & frisch 1993 ) , photons are followed through a dust distribution and their interaction with the dust is parameterized by the optical depth , the albedo , and the scattering phase function asymmetry parameter , as defined in e.g. whittet ( 2003 ) . _",
    "the optical depth determines the probability distribution for where a photon of given wavelength interacts ; the albedo gives the probability that the photon is scattered from a dust grain ; the scattering phase function gives the probability distribution for the angle at which the photon scatters_.    for this application , the dirty code considers a dust - less stellar bulge , penetrated by a dusty , stellar disk , as customary ( see ferrara et al . 1999 and",
    "tuffs et al .",
    "the stellar bulge is modeled as a sphere with a stellar luminosity density decreasing exponentially with radial distance .",
    "this is at variance with the models of both ferrara et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and tuffs et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who considered bulges with @xmath2 radial profiles ( de vaucouleurs 1948 ) .",
    "de vaucouleurs bulges are more typical of early - type spiral galaxies ( andredakis , peletier , & balcells 1995 ; graham 2001 ; hunt , pierini , & giovanardi 2004 ) . the outer radius of the bulge model is assumed to be 4 kpc , with an exponential scale length of 1 kpc , independent of the wavelength of the tracing photons .",
    "the attenuation effects seen in the bulge are caused by a doubly exponential dust disk , which extends from the center of the bulge to the outer edge of the galactic disk component and is described later on .",
    "the stellar disk is modeled as a doubly exponential distribution of sources with a disk radius of 12 kpc and a scale length of 3 kpc , independent of the wavelength of the tracing photons ( see tuffs et al .",
    "2004 for a different description ) .",
    "its total height is 2.1 kpc ( measured from the galactic plane ) but its scale height is assumed to increase with increasing wavelength of the tracing photons ( see mihalas & binney 1981 ) , as summarized in table 1 .",
    "this variation in the stellar scale height is necessary to account for the different types of stars that dominate the flux of a galaxy at different wavelengths : the youngest stars , emitting mostly at far - uv wavelengths , are more embedded in the dusty medium than the older ones , emitting mostly in the optical / near - ir .",
    "other models of radiative transfer deal with this aspect in different ways ( see charlot & fall 2000 ; popescu et al .",
    "2000 ; tuffs et al . 2004 ) .",
    "we note that the dust - to - star scale - height ratio has a larger impact on the attenuation function of a disk than the dust - to - star scale - length ratio ( ferrara et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "dust is present only in a doubly exponential disk with a full radius of 12 kpc , a scale length of 3 kpc , a scale height of 110 pc , and a total height of 2.1 kpc ( measured from the galactic plane ) , that pervades both the stellar disk and the stellar bulge .",
    "it is assumed to consist of dust similar to that found in the average diffuse ism of the milky way ( mw ) ( witt & gordon 2000 ; see valencic , clayton , & gordon 2004 for a recent study ) , its extinction characteristics also summarized in table 1 .",
    "it is locally distributed either in a homogeneous medium or in a two - phase clumpy one , following the algorithm of witt & gordon ( 1996 ) .    in the latter case ,",
    "_ the clump production process is stochastic with respect to the spatial coordinates of individual clumps and the smooth 3-d distribution of the bluest stars_. in particular , the volume is divided into cubic cells with sides of 44 pc , the typical diameter of a galactic giant molecular cloud ( see blitz 1991 ) , each individual cell being assigned randomly to either a high - density state or a low - density state by a monte carlo process .",
    "the high - density - to - low - density medium contrast is set equal to 100 .",
    "the filling factor of the clumps determines the statistical frequency of the bins in the two states ; it is set equal to 0.15 all over the dust disk . since the smooth medium has an exponential distribution , clumps close to the galactic center have a higher extinction optical depth than those in the outskirts of the dust disk . in addition , the filling factor of the clumps sets the likelihood that spatially adjoining cells are occupied by clumps , which leads to the appearence of complex cloud structures composed of one or more connected clumps .",
    "two clumps are considered connected when they share one entire side .",
    "the combination of the percolation approach ( see e.g. stauffer 1985 ) of generating clouds with the filling factor selected does lead to a power - law distribution of cloud sizes , as discussed by witt & gordon ( 1996 ) .",
    "models are parameterized according to the value of @xmath3 , _ the central face - on extinction optical - depth from the surface to the mid - plane of the disk in the v band_. hence the opacity of the disk ( or the total central column density of the dust ) is equal to @xmath4 . for models with the two - phase clumpy dust distribution ,",
    "@xmath3 is formally somewhat ill - defined ( see witt & gordon 1996 ) .",
    "for the two - phase clumpy models , @xmath3 is the value of the face - on extinction optical depth from the surface to the center of the disk in the v band for the homogeneous model with the same total dust mass .",
    "homogeneous and two - phase clumpy models are computed for @xmath5 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 .    the large - scale distribution of the dust within the disk coupled to the parameterization of its clumpiness on the small scale makes the disk models more optically thick in their inner regions than at their outskirts ( see kuchinski et al .",
    "1998 ) , whatever the wavelength .",
    "in fact , any photon traveling in a given direction through the dust disk will face at any step scattering and/or absorption according to the _ local _ value of the optical depth , which changes along both the radial and vertical coordinates as previously described .",
    "for an evaluation of the effects on the attenuation function for a bulge@xmath1disk galaxy caused by a different dust / stars configuration or a different characterization of the clumps , we refer the reader to ferrara et al .",

    "the dusty bulge@xmath1disk system is projected onto the plane of the sky , 10 different inclinations ( 0 , 18 , 36 , 50 , 65 , 70 , 75 , 80 , 85 , and 90 degrees ) being considered .",
    "in addition , 25 wavelengths ( from 0.1 to @xmath6 ) are included , with a decimal logarithmic spacing that puts special care to sampling finely the far - uv domain accessible through _ galex _ ( milliard et al .",

    "@xmath14 , we define the color excess @xmath15 as the difference between the values of the attenuation function ( in magnitudes ) at @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .    here",
    "we stress that , as a result of the radiative transfer of photons with different wavelengths through a realistic dusty medium , the attenuation function @xmath16 ( or @xmath10 ) will be different from the extinction curve assumed for the individual dust grains .",
    "the reason is twofold .",
    "first , radiative transfer determines both absorption and scattering , for a given extinction curve ( see e.g. gordon et al .",
    "2003 ) , taking into account the relative distribution of stars and dust within the system and with respect to the outside observer , and the structure of the dusty medium ( see witt & gordon 1996 ) .",
    "second , the transfer of radiation is investigated throughout the whole system , so that even lines of sight different from the observer s one may contribute to the observed radiation . for a more extensive explanation ,",
    "we refer the reader to calzetti ( 2001 ) .",
    "in sect . 3.1 , we investigate how the attenuation by internal dust of photons of a given wavelength , produced by stars either in the bulge or in the disk and received by the outside observer , depends on both the opacity ( or total central dust column density ) of the disk ( given by @xmath4 ) and the structure ( two - phase clumpy vs. homogeneous ) of the dusty ism of the disk . to this purpose",
    ", we choose one specific value of the inclination @xmath11 of the bulge@xmath1disk galaxy ( i.e. , @xmath17 ) and let @xmath3 increase from 0.25 to 8 .",
    "conversely , in sect .",
    "3.2 , we show how much the dust attenuation for either bulge or disk , and , thus , the observed photometry of either component , depend on the view angle of the galaxy and the structure of the dusty ism of the disk , once the total amount of dust of the system and the extinction law of the mixture of dust grains are fixed .",
    "we will discuss models corresponding to @xmath18 and @xmath11 equal to 0 , 70 or 90 degrees , since the variation of dust attenuation as a function of @xmath11 is rather slow between @xmath19 and @xmath20 but very fast for @xmath21 ( see e.g. ferrara et al .",
    "1999 and masters , giovanelli , & haynes 2003 ) .",
    "two different effects are expected to play a role in shaping @xmath16 , when the inclination of the galaxy increases .",
    "one effect is the `` geometrical '' increase of the line - of - sight optical depth that a photon produced either in the bulge or in the disk faces once it is inside the dust disk on its journey towards the outside observer ( see e.g. kylafis & xilouris 1996 for the case of edge - on exponential disks ) .",
    "the other effect is the variation of the fraction of bulge / disk light which is not affected by the dust disk owing to projection effects .",
    "this variation is different for the bulge and disk structures .",
    "the balance between these two competing effects depends on the wavelength , since both the extinction curve and the disk stellar distribution ( at least in our models ) depend on @xmath7 ( see sect . 2 and table 1 ) .",
    "there is no need to assign any spectral energy distribution to either bulge or disk in order to determine the corresponding attenuation function , since for either component @xmath16 expresses a differential effect .",
    "specification of the bulge and disk spectral energy distributions is needed when one investigates how attenuation by internal dust affects the integrated photometry of a bulge@xmath1disk system as a whole ( e.g. pierini et al .",
    "2003 ; see also tuffs et al .",
    "in fact , in this case one needs to count the photons produced either in the bulge or in the disk .",
    "finally we note that the different curves reproduced in the following figures are not completely smooth and monotonic , from one wavelength included in the models to the next one , because of photon noise in the monte carlo simulations .",
    "1 reproduces the attenuation function calculated for the bulge of a late - type galaxy ( like our own ) seen face on , as a function of @xmath3 ( half the total central dust column density of the disk ) and the structure of the dusty ism .",
    "it also shows the extinction function expected for a homogeneous , non - scattering mw - type dust screen foreground to the light source with total v - band extinction optical depth equal to the total attenuation optical depth at v band of the face - on bulge model with a homogeneous dust disk reproduced in each panel .",
    "this normalization is chosen in order to better show the difference in shape between the curves reproduced in fig .",
    "1 . the comparison between these different curves reminds the non - specialized reader , if needed , that the dust obscuration for an extended object like a bulge is conceptually different from the dust extinction of stars ( see footnote 1 and e.g. calzetti 2001 ) .",
    "2 reproduces the same set of attenuation functions displayed in fig .",
    "1 , each one normalized to the value of the attenuation at 0.55 @xmath0 ( i.e. , @xmath22 ) . in origin , this normalization allowed the comparison of the shapes of extinction curves with different columns of dust at any wavelength . here",
    "it is used to emphasize two aspects of the attenuation function : its slope in the far - uv spectral region and the presence of the so - called `` extinction bump '' at @xmath23 , which is a signature of the average mw - type dust ( see whittet et al .",
    "2004 for a recent discussion ) that is used in our models .",
    "in addition , in fig .",
    "2 we reproduce the extinction function normalized to its v - band value expected for a homogeneous , non - scattering mw - type dust screen foreground to the light source , whatever the total v - band extinction optical depth .",
    "this normalized extinction function is equal to the mw extinction curve normalized to its v - band value listed in table 1 .",
    "the difference in shape between the curves reproduced in fig",
    ". 2 is evident .    from the visual inspection of fig .",
    "1 and 2 , the following characteristics emerge .    *",
    "the average slope of the attenuation function for a face - on bulge increases together with the opacity , for @xmath24 , whatever the structure of the dusty ism .",
    "hence , for the face - on bulge , dust reddening increases together with the disk opacity within the wavelength range where at least the inner region of the dust disk is optically thin . * the average slope of the attenuation function flattens ( steepens ) at wavelengths shorter ( larger ) than @xmath25 when the opacity increases , for @xmath26 , whatever the structure of the dusty ism .",
    "hence , for the face - on bulge , dust reddening tends to a constant value within the wavelength range where at least the inner region of the dust disk becomes optically thick , owing to an increase in opacity .",
    "* for a fixed @xmath7 , @xmath27 increases with increasing opacity , the rate of increase diminishing rapidly at wavelengths shorter than @xmath28 for @xmath29 , whatever the structure of the dusty ism . as a consequence , from the optical through the far - uv spectral range",
    ", @xmath27 is almost the same for @xmath30 , so that the maximum attenuation ( at @xmath31 ) increases only from 0.5 to 1.4 mag when @xmath3 increases from 0.25 to 8 .",
    "hence , for the face - on bulge , the increase in dust attenuation as a function of the disk opacity is strongly non - linear .",
    "* for a fixed value of @xmath32 ( especially for @xmath33 ) , the structure of the dusty ism does not affect to zeroth order the shape of the attenuation function for the face - on bulge . *",
    "nevertheless , a homogeneous dust distribution produces a larger attenuation than a two - phase clumpy one , whatever @xmath32 ( for @xmath34 ) .",
    "this difference reaches a maximum factor of @xmath35 1.6 for @xmath36 . * for very low values of the opacity ( i.e. , for @xmath37 ) , the dust distribution , be it homogeneous or two - phase clumpy , has an almost negligible impact on the attenuation function for the face - on bulge . slight discrepancies ( of the order of 0.15 magnitudes or less ) are present only shortward of @xmath38 ( i.e. , rightward of @xmath39 ) . * at wavelengths shorter than @xmath28 , the discrepancy between the homogeneous case and the two - phase clumpy case increases with increasing opacity , for @xmath29 , but decreases with increasing opacity , for @xmath40 . *",
    "conversely , at wavelengths longer than @xmath25 ( i.e. , leftward of @xmath41 ) , the discrepancy between the homogeneous case and the two - phase clumpy case increases with increasing opacity along the whole range of @xmath3 explored by the models . * the relative prominence of the @xmath42-extinction",
    "bump diminishes when @xmath3 increases .",
    "thus , radiative transfer effect may weaken this feature in far - uv spectra of face - on bulges of nearby galaxies .",
    "this behavior may be explained as follows .",
    "first we recall that , by construction ( see sect . 2 ) , the face - on projection of the bulge is almost coincident with the face - on projection of the dustiest region of the disk ( within one scale length ) , where the _ local _ optical depths are thus the largest .",
    "for this projection , almost half of the bulge stands between the dust disk and the outside observer .",
    "the light produced in the face - on bulge is effectively removed from the observer s line of sight when the amount of dust increases , especially when it is emitted at @xmath43",
    ". however , the increase of @xmath27 together with @xmath3 slows down when a _",
    "local _ optical depth of order 1 is approached across the disk region corresponding to the face - on projection of the bulge ( first at the shortest wavelengths and then at progressively larger ones ) . in the ideal case of a bulge bisected by an opaque dust layer",
    ", we expect that this dust blocks _ exactly _ half of the light emitted by the bulge towards the outside observer ( i.e. , @xmath44 for any @xmath7 ) , when we look at it from a direction perpendicular to the dust layer .",
    "obviously , this is not the dust distribution of our models , so that the shape of the attenuation function for the face - on bulge changes as a function of @xmath3 , while @xmath27 approaches a sort of asymptotic value , when @xmath3 increases from 0.25 to 8 .",
    "this causes the simultaneous flattening of the attenuation function , from the shortest wavelengths towards progressively longer ones , for @xmath26 , whatever the structure of the dusty ism of the disk .",
    "the asymptotic value is larger than 0.75 since the dust / stars configuration of our model does not resemble the ideal case previously described .    the simulations for the face - on bulge confirm that both absorption and scattering diminish in a two - phase clumpy medium , in comparison with a homogeneous medium having the same total mass and type of dust ( see witt & gordon 1996 for a detailed analysis ) .",
    "it is for this reason that the attenuation of the light produced in the face - on bulge at a given wavelength becomes `` grey '' ( i.e. , tends to an asymptotic value ) at slightly lower values of @xmath3 for a homogeneous dust distribution than for a two - phase clumpy one .",
    "_ however , the structure of the dusty ism of the disk produces only negligible effects on the observed colors of a face - on bulge .",
    "_    as a further result of the radiative transfer calculations , we find that the absorption excess represented by the @xmath42-extinction bump ( calzetti et al .",
    "1995 ) is washed out when @xmath3 increases .",
    "this effect was noted first by cimatti et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for a different dust / stars configuration from that assumed here .",
    "what happens in fig .",
    "1 and 2 is that , for photons of the bulge emitted at neighbouring wavelengths with respect to @xmath42 , chances for both ( multiple ) scattering and the eventual absorption increase together with @xmath3 , so that the attenuation reaches an asymptotic value at and around @xmath42 .",
    "fig . 3 and 4",
    "reproduce the attenuation function and the normalized attenuation function , respectively , for the disk of a late - type galaxy seen face on , as a function of the opacity and the structure of the dusty ism of the disk , in analogy with fig . 1 and 2 , respectively , for the bulge .    from the visual inspection of fig .",
    "3 and 4 , we draw the following conclusions .    * the average slope of the attenuation function for a face - on disk increases with increasing opacity , through the whole range of @xmath3 considered here , whatever the structure of the dusty ism . hence",
    ", for the face - on disk , dust reddening is a monotonically increasing function of the opacity .",
    "* however , the attenuation optical depth increases at a reduced rate , at least in the uv spectral region , when @xmath3 becomes larger than 1 , so that the maximum attenuation ( at @xmath31 ) increases from 0.2 to 2.6 mag ( for the homogeneous dust distribution ) when @xmath3 increases from 0.25 to 8 . *",

    "this time the discrepancy in the values of @xmath27 produced by the two very different structures of the dusty ism increases with increasing total central dust column density , whatever the wavelength . * the absorption - excess feature at @xmath23 can be easily identified , though its prominence diminishes with increasing opacity ( for @xmath34 ) .    in order to understand this behavior ,",
    "it is necessary to refresh first some properties of the dust / stars configuration of our disk models .",
    "the distribution of dust and stars along the radial coordinate of the disk is assumed to be described by the same exponential law , whatever the parent stellar population of the stars .",
    "conversely , the vertical distribution of the different stars of the disk depends on their parent stellar population .",
    "thus the scale height decreases together with the wavelength characterizing to zeroth order the age of the individual stars ( see sect . 2 and table 1 ) .",
    "as a consequence , the fraction of light which is produced in the disk at a given wavelength and is affected by the dust , depends even more on @xmath7 , with respect to the case of a vertical distribution with a unique scale height ( as e.g. in ferrara et al .",
    "1999 ) , for fixed extinction properties , total amount of dust , and structure of the dusty ism of the disk .",
    "having assumed the dust / stars configuration for the disk as in sect .",
    "2 , we note that the light produced by the stars in the outskirts of the disk will shine almost unattenuated for very low values of the disk opacity , whatever the wavelength",
    ". however , when @xmath3 increases , a _ local _ optical depth @xmath45 or larger will be eventually reached within a progressively thicker region , delimited by a progressively larger radius ; the longer @xmath7 the smaller this region .",
    "it is now straightforward to understand why , for the face - on disk , @xmath27 increases together with @xmath3 , at any given @xmath7 , and why this increase is so dramatic at @xmath46 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the best example of the importance of the dust / stars configuration for the result of the radiative transfer analyzed here is offered by the far - uv photons emitted at @xmath47 , since they are produced by the stars the most deeply embedded in the dust layer ( see table 1 ) .",
    "these photons might eventually never reach the outside observer if @xmath3 were allowed to increase indefinitely , whatever the height from the galactic plane and radius where they are produced .",
    "conversely , optical / near - ir photons may still reach the observer in large number even for @xmath48 .",
    "for photons emitted at a fixed wavelength , a constant value of the attenuation equal to 0.75 mag is expected when we see half the light from the face - on disk bisected by an opaque dust layer .",
    "since the dust / stars configuration matters , our face - on disk models produce an attenuation of less than 0.75 mag for photons emitted shortward of @xmath49 even for @xmath50 .",
    "we also note that the attenuation at uv wavelengths almost doubles its initial value when @xmath3 increase from 0.25 to 0.5 , and from 0.5 to 1 . at those wavelengths ,",
    "the increase of @xmath27 together with @xmath3 slows down for larger values of @xmath3 . despite that",
    ", the absorption - excess feature at @xmath23 may still be easily identified in the attenuation function for the face - on disk model with @xmath48 , though its prominence has become modest .",
    "information on this feature is carried by the light escaping from the regions of the disk where the _ local _ optical depth is low enough ( e.g. in the outskirts of the disk ) .",
    "finally , we note that the attenuation in the k band assumes a slightly negative value in the case of a face - on disk with @xmath37 ( or less ) .",
    "this means that the outside observer receives more k - band photons from the face - on disk than it would be in absence of dust .",
    "the reason for this excess is the contribution of those k - band photons initially traveling in different directions but scattered by the dust towards the outside observer .",
    "this effect has already been highlighted by baes & dejonghe ( 2001 ) .    from the visual inspection of fig . 1 through 4 it is clear that the solutions of the radiative transfer for bulge and disk of a late - type galaxy seen face on are different .",
    "the reason is the different distribution of stars and dust for either system with respect to the outside observer .",
    "the face - on projection of the bulge is always within the dustiest region of the disk ( by construction ) , and , if the opacity is large enough , the fraction of stars whose light is significantly affected by the dust is the same whatever the emission wavelength .",
    "conversely , for the same value of the opacity , the face - on projection of the disk will present regions almost unaffected by the dust at larger galactocentric distances the shorter the wavelength of the emitted photons . at the same time , the fraction of stars of the disk whose light is significantly affected by the dust is larger the shorter the emission wavelength , whatever the radial distance ( also by construction ) .",
    "of course , for both bulge and disk , geometry is convolved with the selective nature of absorption and scattering in the computation of the attenuation function .      here",
    "we discuss the behavior of the optical color excess @xmath51 and the near - ir color excess @xmath52 , as defined in sect .",
    "2 , as a function of the opacity and the structure of the dusty ism of the disk . this exercise offers a very useful example of how confusing the extinction law of the mixture of dust grains present in the dusty ism of a galaxy with the attenuation function of the galaxy itself may lead to extremely wrong conclusions regarding the color excess expected for this dusty stellar system .",
    "furthermore , we discuss whether the ratio of total to selective _ attenuation _",
    "@xmath53 for a dusty stellar system , like a late - type galaxy , represents a diagnostic of the total - to - selective _ extinction _ ratio of the mixture of dust grains that this system contains .",
    "the values of the attenuation function at the effective wavelengths of the filters b , v , j , and k ( i.e. , at @xmath54 0.44 , 0.55 , 1.25 , and @xmath55 , respectively ) are determined from the linear interpolation of the models displayed in fig . 1 and 3 .    for the face - on bulge , @xmath51 reaches an absolute maximum of about 0.1 mag for @xmath36 and decreases down to @xmath56 mag for larger values of the opacity in the homogeneous case , while it never exceeds @xmath57 mag ( for @xmath34 ) in the two - phase clumpy case ( see fig .",

    "this behavior is surprising only at first glance .",
    "in fact we can understand it when considering the results reproduced in fig . 1 and 2 .",
    "there it is shown that @xmath60 is slightly greater than @xmath22 and increases faster than @xmath22 for @xmath61 , especially in the homogeneous case .",

    "@xmath51 never reaches values larger than 0.1 mag when @xmath3 increases beyond @xmath63 since the attenuation function at optical wavelengths is rather flat for @xmath64 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the amount of reddening of a ( face - on ) bulge , as measured by @xmath51 , is not a measure of the opacity of the associated dust disk , except for low values of @xmath3 .",

    "a larger fraction of the bulge comes into the view of the outside observer unobstructed by the dust disk , when @xmath11 increases .",
    "in fact , the bulge model has a ( wavelength - independent ) scale height larger than that of the dust distribution by almost a factor of 10 , and a radial extension 3 times shorter than that of the dust disk ( cf .",
    "2 ) . fig .",
    "15 shows that the increase of the projected surface of the bulge which is unobstructed by the dust disk prevails over the competing increase of the _ local _ optical depth through the dust disk , for all wavelengths except the longest near - ir ones . at the same time , the attenuation function for the edge - on bulge is grey throughout almost the whole spectral region under consideration .",
    "for this reason , the absorption peak at @xmath23 , typical of the mw - type extinction law , is almost undetectable in the attenuation function of the edge - on bulge .    from the previous discussion ,",
    "it is clear that the blocking action of the dust disk must peak at some intermediate inclination , since almost half of the bulge stands between the dust disk and the observer , in the face - on case , and most of the projected surface of the bulge is unobstructed by the dust disk , in the edge - on case . the value of the inclination which maximizes the blocking action of the dust disk will depend on the wavelength of the emitted photons .",
    "in addition to the previous two geometric effects , the wavelength - dependence of the scattering phase function asymmetry parameter ( see table 1 ) plays a role in interpreting fig .",
    "15 and 16 .",
    "we recall that scattering is more forward directed the shorter the wavelength of the scattered photon .",
    "thus the near - ir photons emitted in the bulge and traveling through the dust disk will have a greater probability of being scattered out of the observer s line of sight than the optical / far - uv ones , in the edge - on case .",
    "this contributes to explaining why the attenuation by internal dust of the light produced in the bulge at near - ir wavelengths increases monotonically together with the inclination of the galaxy .",

    "this is explained in the following section .",
    "the dependence on inclination of the attenuation function for a disk with @xmath18 and mw - type dust is very dramatic , as shown in fig .",
    "in fact , the attenuation increases ( almost doubling its initial value ) at any @xmath7 , when @xmath11 increases from @xmath19 up to @xmath20 , owing to the increasing probability of absorption for a photon of any wavelength traveling through the dust disk towards the outside observer . for higher inclinations",
    ", the attenuation function becomes suddenly very steep , with the result that @xmath96 in the edge - on case .    for inclinations close to @xmath97 ,",
    "the photons produced in the dustiest region of the disk and traveling towards the outside observer will be eventually absorbed there , whatever their wavelength .",
    "the photons produced in the peripheral ( and less dusty ) regions of the disk and traveling towards the outside observer will experience significantly increased values of the line - of - sight optical depth with respect to the face - on case .",
    "they may be scattered out of the observer s line of sight , if their wavelength belongs to the optical / near - ir domain .",
    "conversely , photons produced at higher heights above the disk will have a greater probability to reach the outside observer . since the ratio of stellar disk scale - height and dust disk scale - height is an increasing function of the emission wavelength , by construction ( see sect . 2 and table 1 )",
    ", absorption will be even more dramatic the shorter the wavelength .",
    "in addition to the previous geometrical effect , the wavelength - dependence of the scattering phase function asymmetry parameter ( see table 1 ) predicts that ( multiple ) scattered photons will be eventually absorbed in larger fraction the shorter their wavelength , as already discussed .",
    "this explains the abrupt rise of @xmath27 at far - uv wavelengths for inclinations close to @xmath97 . as a consequence , for these inclinations , the @xmath42-bump , typical of mw - type dust , is almost undetectable ( see fig .",
    "17 and 18 ) .",
    "finally , we note that the impact of the structure of the dusty ism on the attenuation function , in terms of absolute values and shape , is almost negligible when the disk is seen at @xmath98 . for such high inclinations",
    ", the optical depth along the observer s line of sight may be much larger than unity for many if not most of the wavelengths just because many dust clumps line up in that direction .",
    "hence the eventual absorption of a photon of given wavelength happens just by virtue of the total cross section ( or blocking effect ) of the dust clumps .",
    "this result complements that of matthews & woods ( 2001 ) , who noted that differences in the structure of the dusty ism , for their edge - on models , impact sensitively on the values of the attenuation but not on the shape of the attenuation function .      for the bulge models associated with a dust disk having @xmath18 , fig .",

    "conversely , @xmath52 is a strongly non - linear function of the galaxy inclination : it increases from @xmath101 to @xmath59 mag , when @xmath11 increases from @xmath19 to @xmath102 ; it decreases for higher inclinations , whatever the dust distribution ( see fig .",
    "the initial increase of @xmath52 is a consequence of the steepening of the attenuation function for the bulge in the near - ir , when @xmath11 increases from @xmath19 to @xmath20 , which means that the dusty medium crossed by the photons emitted in the bulge and traveling towards the outside observer tends to become optically thick also in this wavelength domain .",
    "the decrease of both @xmath51 and @xmath52 for inclinations approaching @xmath97 is due to the fact that an increasing fraction of the light produced in the bulge reaches the outside observer without being affected by the dust ( within the disk ) .",

    "the reason why @xmath87 keeps on decreasing in the near - ir , for @xmath98 , although a larger fraction of the bulge comes into the view of the outside observer without being obstructed by the dust disk , is that both absorption and scattering out of the observer s line of sight become more effective in the near - ir , for @xmath18 .",

    "these aspects are discussed in sect .",
    "we recall that our models assume a purely stochastic distribution of the dust clumps , with respect to each other and the bluest stars .",
    "the dust clumps are simulated as cubic cells with a size of 44 pc , and a filling factor set equal to 0.15 all over the dust disk , while the clumpy - to - diffuse ism phase density ratio is set equal to 100 .",
    "this set of parameters was found by witt & gordon ( 1996 ) to be closest to that representing the structured ism of the galaxy . for a spherically symmetric geometry",
    ", it represents an intermediate case between the case where the interclump medium controls the optical depth of the system , with results very similar to the homogeneous case , and the case where the optical depth of the system is controlled by the blocking effect of the clumps and is then proportional to the filling factor ( see witt & gordon 1996 ) .",
    "since the diffuse ism of the disk models used here has a doubly exponential distribution , clumps close to the center of the galaxy have higher opical depths than those at the periphery of the disk .",
    "conversely , the dust clumps in the monte carlo simulations of bianchi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) are distributed mostly in a ring structure ( clemens et al .",

    "( 2000 ) corresponds to quite low global filling factors , for the three values of the fraction of the total gas mass attributed by the latter authors to the molecular component of the ism .",
    "bianchi et al . and misiriotis & bianchi ( 2002 ) have already discussed the differences in the behavior of the attenuation for the disk , which arise as a consequence of these two different parameterizations of the clumpy ism , as a function of the inclination of the galaxy .",
    "a low filling factor of the clumps ( equal to 0.06 ) and a density contrast of 20 seem to reproduce better the structured ism of low surface brightness galaxies like ugc 7321 ( matthews & wood 2001 ) .",
    "the different set of parameters describing the clumpiness of the dusty ism in the milky way ( witt & gordon 1996 ) and in the low rotational velocity sd galaxy ugc 7321 may reflect systematic changes in the turbulent velocities supporting the gas layer of a disk galaxy as a function of rotational velocity ( dalcanton , yoachim , & bernstein 2004 ) .",
    "finally , constant , large optical depths ( whatever the wavelength ) are assumed by tuffs et al .",
    "( 2004 ) to characterize the clumpy distribution of dust in their models , that is associated with the opaque parent molecular clouds of massive stars ( see also silva et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the attenuation produced by this clumpy component of the ism does not depend on the inclination of the galaxy ( tuffs et al .",
    "its wavelength dependence is due to the different blocking action of the clumps on the photons emitted by stars of different masses ( and , thus , ages ) .",
    "stars of different masses survive for different times , so that lower mass , redder stars can escape further away from the star - forming complexes during their longer lifetimes .",
    "the models under investigation here include only milky way - type dust ( witt & gordon 2000 ) , while ferrara et al .",
    "( 1999 ) consider also small magellanic cloud - type dust ( witt & gordon 2000 ) .",
    "the values of albedo and , especially , asymmetry of the scattering phase function for milky way - type dust given by witt & gordon and listed in table 1 differ sensitively from those adopted by tuffs et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "the doubly exponential disk models considered here assume that the stars emitting their bulk luminosity at a given wavelength have a larger scale height the longer the wavelength of the tracing photons ( see table 1 ) , but the same scale length whatever the wavelength .",
    "this is at variance with the doubly exponential disk models of ferrara et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and matthews & wood ( 2001 ) , where the dust - to - stars scale - height ratio is independent of the wavelength .",
    "conversely , tuffs et al .",
    "( 2004 ) assume that the old and young stellar populations of the disk are distributed with two different scale heights but with the same scale length , the latter increasing the shorter the wavelength .",
    "in addition , in their disk models old and young stars have different dust - to - stars scale - height ratios , independent of @xmath7 .",
    "these differences reflect the present ambiguous knowledge of the global structure of disks .",
    "structural studies of edge - on disk galaxies seem to reveal the ubiquity of thick disks with red , old stellar populations similar to the thick disk of the milky way ( e.g. de grijs & van der kruit 1996 ; dalcanton & bernstein 2002 ) , but the magnitude of the intrinsic vertical color gradients is uncertain ( e.g. de grijs & peletier 2000 ) . in addition , it is not established yet if the wavelength dependence of the scale lengths of a disk galaxy represents also the existence of stellar population gradients along the radial direction ( e.g. de jong 1996 ; kuchinski et al . 1998 ; xilouris et al . 1999 ) or is only due to dust attenuation ( e.g. de grijs 1998 ) .    finally ,",
    "the bulge models under investigation here have exponential radial profiles against the de vaucouleurs one included by ferrara et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and tuffs et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . in all three cases",
    "the typical scale of the bulge does not depend on the wavelength however .    in the previous sections ,",
    "we have illustrated how the attenuation function , the color excess , and the fraction of light scattered towards the outside observer behave as a function of the total central face - on extinction optical - depth at v band ( i.e. , the opacity , equal to @xmath4 in our models ) of the disk , the inclination of the galaxy , and the structure ( two - phase clumpy vs. homogeneous ) of the dusty ism of the disk .",
    "as a first result , we confirm that _ the attenuation function for either bulge or disk changes dramatically as a function of both the disk opacity _ ( see sect .",
    "3.1.1 ) , regulating the total amount of dust of the models , _ and the inclination @xmath11 of the galaxy , for fixed dust / stars configuration and structure of the dusty ism of the disk _ ( see sect .",
    "this has been already described by ferrara et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , pierini et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and tuffs et al .",
    "it is no surprise : it is a direct consequence of the definition of the attenuation function as the combination of the extinction curve with the geometry of a dusty stellar system .",
    "the extinction curve describes the combined absorption and out - of - the - beam scattering properties of a mixture of dust grains of given size distribution and chemical composition in a screen geometry as a function of wavelength .",
    "it is an intrinsic property of the system , together with the total amount of dust , the 3-d distribution of dust and stars , and the structure of the dusty ism .",
    "conversely , geometry depends also on the view angle of the system , since the aspect of the dust / stars configuration changes as a function of the observer s line of sight . for all these reasons",
    "the behavior of the attenuation as a function of the opacity and the inclination of a bulge@xmath1disk galaxy is expected to be different for bulge and disk . as a consequence ,",
    "we find , not surprisingly ( see e.g. calzetti 2001 ) , that the attenuation function for either bulge or disk is very different from the extinction function expected for a homogeneous , non - scattering mw - type dust screen foreground to the light source .",
    "the same applies to any color excess .    for the bulge of a face - on late - type galaxy , the attenuation at a fixed wavelength @xmath7 increases with increasing @xmath3 , while the attenuation function becomes increasingly flat ( or `` gray '' ) at those wavelengths where the line - of - sight optical depth is larger than unity across most of the region of the dust disk corresponding to the face - on projection of the bulge ( fig . 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the structure of the dusty ism induces larger differences in the absolute value of the attenuation at a fixed @xmath7 for intermediate values of @xmath3 , but it does not affect the shape of the attenuation function for @xmath64 . in an analogous way , the attenuation function for a bulge associated with a dust disk having fixed opacity ( e.g. the case of @xmath18 ) becomes increasingly `` gray '' and less affected by the structure of the dusty medium when @xmath11 increases .",
    "nevertheless , a bulge suffers less attenuation when the inclination of the galaxy approaches @xmath97 , since a larger fraction of its light is not intercepted by the dust disk .",
    "this , of course , depends on the bulge - to - dust disk scale - height ratio , as discussed by ferrara et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "for the disk of a face - on galaxy , the attenuation at a fixed @xmath7 increases when @xmath3 increases , but the attenuation function does not become as gray as for the face - on bulge .",
    "in fact the _ local _ optical depths may still be low in the outer regions of the disk .",
    "furthermore , for the face - on disk , the absolute values and shape of the attenuation function depend more on @xmath3 than on the structure of the dusty ism ( fig . 3 and 4 ) .",
    "also for a disk with fixed opacity ( e.g. the case of @xmath18 ) , the absolute values and shape of the attenuation function depend more on the inclination than on the structure of the dusty medium , especially for @xmath21 ( fig .",
    "15 and 16 ) , consistent with matthews & wood ( 2001 ) .",
    "this is at variance with the result of bianchi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) however .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is the different description of the distribution and the clumpiness of the dusty ism , as discussed by the latter authors .",
    "the previous results on the attenuation function allow us to understand the behavior of the color excess .",
    "for a face - on bulge , we find that @xmath51 reaches an asymptotic value of @xmath113 mag already for @xmath36 , while @xmath52 increases up to 0.20.3 mag along the whole range in disk opacity probed by the models .",
    "we remember that saturation of a color excess is reached when line - of - sight optical depths of the order of unity or more are reached for the effective wavelengths of both bands defining that color .",
    "conversely , for the face - on disk , both @xmath51 and @xmath52 increase monotonically up to @xmath114 mag when @xmath3 increases .",
    "the view angle of the galaxy affects the color excess , of course . for a bulge associated with a disk having @xmath18",
    ", @xmath51 stays constant up to @xmath115 and drops almost by half for higher inclinations , while @xmath52 increases from @xmath56 up to @xmath59 mag , when @xmath11 reaches @xmath116 and drops to 0.14 mag for @xmath117 .",
    "conversely , for a disk with @xmath18 , both @xmath51 and @xmath52 increase monotonically when @xmath11 increases . in general , a homogeneous dust distribution produces larger values of @xmath51 and @xmath52",
    ". however , for systems seen almost edge on , the structure of the dusty ism has no impact on the color excess for either bulge or disk , consistent with the result of matthews & wood ( 2001 ) for their edge - on disk models . in general ,",
    "the structure of the dusty ism of the disk has a larger effect on the observed magnitudes than on the observed colors of either bulge or disk component , according to our models .",
    "the study of the behavior of the optical and near - ir color excesses of bulge and disk , as a function of disk opacity and galaxy inclination has important consequences for the interpretation of the colors of galaxies spanning the whole sequence of late hubble types .",
    "for example , fioc & rocca - volmerange ( 1999 ) find that the observed total @xmath118 and @xmath119 colors of sa  sbc galaxies are redder than those of elliptical and lenticular galaxies by 0.04 and 0.05 mag , respectively .",
    "they comment that `` the differential internal extinction , negligible in the near - ir , is also unlikely to cause this phenomenon '' .",
    "our previous results clearly contradict their conclusion . _",
    "these results hint at a sensitive differential effect of the internal extinction in the near - ir , especially for the ( exponential ) bulge of a late - type galaxy_. in case of a galaxy with average inclination @xmath115 and @xmath120 , an exponential bulge may by reddened by @xmath121 mag ( fig .",
    "19 ) against a value of @xmath122 mag for its disk ( fig .",
    "these figures are consistent with the fact that observed , total @xmath123 colors of bulge - dominated , early - type spiral galaxies are redder than those of e / s0 galaxies by 0.09 mag , when taking into account that these galaxies have more @xmath2-like bulges ( see e.g. andredakis et al .",
    "1995 ; graham 2001 ; hunt et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "furthermore , we find that _ a measure of the total - to - selective attenuation ratio is not equivalent to a measure of the total - to - selective extinction ratio _ , that characterizes the dust mixture present in a dusty galaxy : the former ratio changes a lot as a function of the opacity and inclination of the system .",
    "this study focuses on the properties of the scattered light more than others , also including anisotropic multiple scattering , for bulge@xmath1disk systems .",
    "we find , not surprisingly ( e.g. witt & gordon 1996 ) , that a homogeneous dust distribution absorbs and scatters more light at any fixed @xmath7 than a two - phase clumpy one , whether this light was produced either in the bulge or in the disk , for almost all values of @xmath3 and @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , for the edge - on view of a spiral galaxy with @xmath18 , the fraction of light emitted by either the bulge or the disk towards the outside observer does not depend on the clumpiness of the dusty ism , whatever @xmath7 .    _",
    "the fraction of light produced either in the bulge or in the disk at a fixed @xmath7 and scattered towards the outside observer is also a function of @xmath3 and @xmath11 , and so is the color of the total scattered light_. in particular , for a given @xmath7 , this fraction increases with increasing disk - averaged optical depth along the observer s line of sight , up to the point that most of the single and multiple scattered photons get eventually absorbed or leave the system in a direction different from the observer s line of sight ( especially for optical / near - ir wavelengths ) .",
    "dust grains scatter more efficiently and in a more forward direction , as well as absorb , the shorter the wavelength of the photons ( see table 1 ) .",
    "thus , for a fixed inclination ( e.g. @xmath17 ) , the color of the light emitted from either the bulge or the disk and scattered towards the outside observer will turn from blue to red when @xmath3 increases .",
    "conversely , for a fixed value of disk opacity ( e.g. in the case of @xmath18 ) , the color of the light emitted by either bulge or disk and scattered towards the outside observer will stay almost the same when @xmath11 increases ( except for the edge - on disk ) .",
    "_ for the light received by the outside observer and produced either in the bulge or in the disk at a given wavelength , the fraction which is scattered by the dust corresponds up to 2030 per cent of the fraction which reaches the observer without being affected by the dust , for the face - on bulge , and up to 1095 per cent for the face - on disk , as a function of the opacity and the structure of the dusty ism_. for the outside observer , the ratio of scattered - to - directly transmitted light , @xmath88 , decreases ( increases ) with increasing @xmath3 for the face - on bulge ( disk ) , whatever the emission wavelength and whatever the structure of the dusty medium .",
    "this ratio decreases with increasing inclination for the bulge of a galaxy with @xmath3 equal to unity , whatever @xmath7 and whatever the structure of the dusty ism . for the disk of the same galaxy ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath88 as a function of @xmath11 is more complex .",
    "this time @xmath88 increases with increasing inclination , for @xmath111 @xmath11 @xmath112 , whatever @xmath7 and whatever the structure of the dusty ism ; it decreases with increasing inclination , for @xmath124 @xmath11 @xmath125 , when @xmath126 , whatever the structure of the dusty ism ; it increases ( stays almost constant ) with increasing inclination , for @xmath124 @xmath11 @xmath125 , when @xmath127 and the structure of the dusty ism is two - phase clumpy ( homogeneous ) .",
    "of course this result depends also on the wavelength dependence of the albedo and the scattering phase function asymmetry parameter assumed for the mixture of dust grains and on the relative distribution of photons of given wavelength and dust within the disk ( see table 1 ) .",
    "in general , the contribution of the scattered radiation to the total monochromatic light received by the outside observer is significant , especially at uv wavelengths , even for a two - phase , clumpy , dusty ism . hence understanding dust scattering properties ( see e.g. gordon 2004 for a discussion )",
    "is fundamental for the interpretation of e.g. the uv extragalactic observations made with _ galex _",
    "( milliard et al . 2001 ) .",
    "finally , our investigation confirms that _ radiative transfer effects may dilute the relative prominence of the extinction feature _ at @xmath42 , distinctive of the milky way - type dust present in our models , when the attenuation optical depth in the far - uv range is large enough , for either bulge or disk , whatever the structure of the dusty ism .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of cimatti et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and ferrara et al .",
    "the latter authors attributed the disappearence of this feature to scattering modulation due to geometry and multiple scattering of photons on dust grains .",
    "in fact the probability for events of ( multiple ) scattering increases when the disk - averaged optical depth along the observer s line of sight increases .",
    "however , multiple scattered photons emitted at neighboring wavelengths of the @xmath42-extinction bump will be eventually absorbed , owing to the wavelength - dependence of the scattering phase function asymmetry parameter .",
    "hence absorption will increase faster at neighboring wavelengths of @xmath42 .",
    "the models of a bulge@xmath1disk galaxy used here simulate structural characteristics of an sbc galaxy like our own , nevertheless the results of sect .",
    "3.1.2 and 3.2.2 may be qualitatively applied to spiral galaxies of earlier type ( cf .",
    "ferrara et al .",
    "1999 and tuffs et al .",

    "1995 ; graham 2001 ; hunt et al .",

    "<S> we present results of new monte carlo calculations made with the dirty code of radiative transfer of stellar and scattered radiation for a dusty giant late - type galaxy like the milky way , which illustrate the effect of the attenuation of stellar light by internal dust on the integrated photometry of the individual bulge and disk components . here </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the behavior of the attenuation function , the color excess , and the fraction of light scattered or directly transmitted towards the outside observer as a function of the total amount of dust and the inclination of the galaxy , and the structure of the dusty interstellar medium ( ism ) of the disk . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that dust attenuation produces qualitatively and quantitatively different effects on the integrated photometry of bulge and disk , whatever the wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find that the structure of the dusty ism affects more sensitively the observed magnitudes than the observed colors of both bulge and disk . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that the contribution of the scattered radiation to the total monochromatic light received by the outside observer is significant , particularly at uv wavelengths , even for a two - phase , clumpy , dusty ism . </S>",
    "<S> thus understanding dust scattering properties is fundamental for the interpretation of extragalactic observations in the rest - frame uv . </S>"
