    "the s2b model studied here is the standard s2b model from @xcite .",

    "the dynamically cool inner disk generates a bar instability separate from the one in the outer part , resulting in a double - barred structure . as shown in fig . 2 in @xcite , the morphology of the newly formed inner bar is quite rectangular , or even peanut - like .",

    "a unique advantage of simulations is that we can project the simulated galaxy to any desired orientation . to extract reliable kinematics , including the high - order gauss - hermite moments @xmath9 and @xmath4 @xcite , the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) @xmath32 is usually considered necessary . for simulations ,",
    "given that the number of particles follows poissonian statistics , the required s / n can be transformed into a requirement on the number of particles ( @xmath33 ) in each bin ( s / n=@xmath34 ) . here",
    "we apply the widely used voronoi - binning method @xcite to bin particles in such a way that each bin typically contains at least 2500 particles",

    "the other three panels show @xmath8 fields of the s2b model when the relative position angle of the two bars ( pa@xmath50 pa@xmath51pa@xmath52 ) is @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , respectively . for the s2b model ,",
    "@xmath8 fields are similar to those of the sb model in the large - scale bar regions , as the large - scale bars in the s2b and sb models rotate at nearly the same pattern speed . at the very central regions where the inner bar dominates",
    ", the isovelocity contours even break up , forming local minima and maxima , especially the inner bar is perpendicular to the lon ( the rightmost panel , pa@xmath55 ) . in the case of an inclined axisymmetric nuclear disk ,",
    "the kinematic axis must align with the lon .",
    "since stars in bar regions have significant radial streaming motions , the kinematic axis is expected to be misaligned from the lon . as shown in fig .",
    "[ meanv ] when pa@xmath56 , within the projected regions of the inner bar , the isovelocity contours are slightly distorted toward the opposite direction of the major axis of the inner bar , in agreement with @xcite",
    ". thus it might be because the twists are too weak that the kinematic axis of the observed galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : atlas3d ] and [ fig : ngc3384 ] ) does not exhibit a clear misalignment with the lon in the central regions .",
    "furthermore , as presented in section  [ section : atlas3d ] , and have a rotation - dominated nuclear disk which also significantly weakens the misalignment .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that previous observations @xcite did not find clear signs of the existence of decoupled inner bars in the form of central velocity twists .",
    "moreover , we also did not find significant kinematic misalignments at the central regions of the single - barred ( sb ) model at most inclinations and bar orientations , which is consistent with the ifu observations of early - type barred galaxies @xcite .",
    "the ifu observations show that the kinematic misalignment is always quite small ( @xmath57 level ) .",
    "we propose that such a result is because the bars in early - type galaxies have large random motions .",
    "although the velocity twists are insignificant in the central regions , we notice that the observed s2bs present consistent velocity twists at intermediate radii between the two bars . as shown in fig .",
    "[ meanv ] , for the s2b model , some isovelocity contours ( highlighted with white curves ) are significantly distorted toward the central regions at intermediate radii ( @xmath58 kpc ) of the transition zone between the two bars .",
    "independent of the relative orientation of the two bars and the inclination , such twists occur far from the photometric ends ( the isodensity contour at level 0.8 ) of the inner bar .",
    "the transition zone where @xmath8 twists occur is the region where the two bars are mixed and interacting . for , and , significant twists also appear at positions quite far from the end of the inner bar ( highlighted with white curves ) , which is consistent with the s2b model .",
    "it is also worth noticing that the twists can be significantly asymmetric with respect to the lon .",
    "for example , the asymmetric twists in can be clearly seen along the white isovelocity contours .",
    "on the upper side of the lon , the top - left arm is slightly distorted , while , on the lower side , the bottom - left arm has a nearly @xmath54 twist .",
    "the s2b model gives twists very consistent with those in .",
    ", which hosts only a weak inner bar , does not exhibit twists as significant as the model in their @xmath8 fields , and the weak twists occur at positions close to the end of the inner bar . without nuclear disk in the model ,",
    "such asymmetric twists may be caused by the non - axisymmetric motions in the transition zone of the s2b structure .",
    "the @xmath2 maps of the s2b model are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s2bsigma ] .",
    "because varying the orientation of the outer bar does not lead to a significant difference , we fix the outer bar on the lon ( the @xmath48-axis ) .",

    "when the inner bar is nearly perpendicular to the lon , @xmath2-humps are barely visible at intermediate inclinations ( @xmath64 ) .",

    "the physical origin of @xmath2-humps is still unclear .",
    "@xcite proposed that @xmath2-hollows might originate from a dynamically cold inner bar which is embedded in a relatively hotter ( classical ) bulge .",

    "@xmath8 is negative at @xmath79 and positive at @xmath80 .",
    "it is not surprising that widespread @xmath3 anti - correlation appears around the outer bar where losvds are dominated by circular motions of the disk . with increasing @xmath81 , the correlation between @xmath9 and @xmath8 expands to all over the projected regions of the outer bar .",
    "this result is consistent with the single - barred cases studied in @xcite .",

    "when the inner bar is nearly perpendicular to the lon ( e.g. @xmath82 gyr ) , @xmath3 changes to anti - correlation again at high inclinations @xmath83 , while when the inner bar is parallel to the lon ( e.g. @xmath84 gyr ) there is no significant @xmath3 anti - correlation .",
    "we propose that the @xmath3 anti - correlation , appearing in the projected inner bar regions , is caused by the significant streaming motions in the inner bar which compose the high velocity peak of the losvds , thus generating @xmath3 anti - correlation . in order to clarify the @xmath9 features clearly , we considered the non - gaussian losvds as bimodal profiles which are assumed to be composed by two independent gaussian components , i.e. , the high @xmath85 component and the low @xmath85 component . used to quantify the asymmetric deviation , @xmath9 is equal to zero in the cases that the two components have the exactly same distribution . in the cases that the low @xmath85 component is stronger than the high @xmath85 component ,",
    "the losvd is composed by a main peak dominated by low @xmath85 component and a high @xmath85 tail , in which case @xmath9 is correlated with @xmath8 .",
    "in contrast , if the high @xmath85 component is stronger , the losvd is composed by a high @xmath85 peak and a low @xmath85 tail , yielding an anti - correlation of @xmath9 and @xmath8 . in the outer bar regions ,",
    "the high - speed streaming motions in the outer bar generate the high @xmath85 tail in the losvds which peak at low @xmath85 , thus generating @xmath3 correlation . in the inner bar regions , because a large fraction of stars participate in the high - speed streaming motions in the inner bar , the high @xmath85 component dominates the losvds , thus @xmath9 can be anti - correlated with @xmath8 .",
    "especially when the inner bar is perpendicular to the lon , the elongated motions in the inner bar well overlap with the line - of - sight to some extent , leading to most prominent @xmath3 anti - correlations .",
    "because at @xmath63 the bars and the disk are superposed , the nuclear @xmath3 anti - correlation is weakened . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s2br3h4 ] , the s2b also has noticeable @xmath4 features . in nearly face - on views ,",

    "such positive @xmath4 rings around the inner bar were also noted by @xcite . with increasing inclination , positive @xmath4 rings become weaker and gradually disappear .",
    "such features suggest that , compared with their surroundings , bars are more tightly bound at the mid - plane , thus the vertical velocity distribution is more peaked . in the intermediate regions",

    "is widely distributed all over the disk . at the central regions where the resolution is highest",
    ", we can not identify a @xmath4 ring that is closely related to the inner bar , possibly because of the penalization on high - order gauss - hermite moments with the ` ppxf `  method , as mentioned in section  [ section : atlas3d ] .",
    "as shown above , s2b galaxies have very different nuclear kinematics from single - barred galaxies . the inner bar in s2bs exhibits many distinguishable properties that have never been found in a large single bar .",
    "do these results suggest that the inner bar is essentially a different structure to normal bars ? because of the superposition of different components along the line of sight , the structural information is tangled in complex losvds . to improve our understanding of s2bs",

    "[ fig : s2bcylob ] , the large - scale bars in the sb and s2b models have similar radial streaming motions , i.e. , butterfly - shaped radial motions ( @xmath87 ) extending to nearly half the length of the bars . as mentioned in section  [",
    "subsection : models ] , the rotation curve of the models here flattens at @xmath88 km / s .",
    "it is clear that the stars in the outer disk rotate at @xmath89 , and the disk thus dominated by nearly circular motions .",
    "the large - scale bars in both the sb and s2b models extend close to its corotation radius . at the ends of the large - scale bars stars rotate at roughly @xmath89 . in the inner regions of the large - scale bars , the tangential velocity decreases significantly .",
    "thus the random motions gradually become more important .",
    "we highlight the velocity dispersion contours at @xmath90 with thick white curves . for large - scale bars ,",
    "the radial velocity dispersion @xmath91 is always aligned with the bar ; the tangential velocity dispersion @xmath92 is perpendicular to the bar .",
    "we compare the case when the two bars are parallel ( the middle row ) with when they are perpendicular ( the bottom row ) .",
    "the relative orientation of the two bars has no significant effect on the intrinsic motions of the outer bar in the s2b model .",
    "compared with the large - scale bar in the sb model ( the top row ) , the outer bar in the s2b model has no distinguishable differences .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : s2bcylib ] , we zoom into the central regions of fig .  [",
    "fig : s2bcylob ] .",
    "as expected , the inner bar generates @xmath87 and @xmath93 features decoupled from the outer bar ( the middle and bottom rows ) , while the bar in the sb model ( the top row ) acts as a solid body . for the inner bar in the s2b model",
    ", @xmath93 shows significant local maxima along the minor axis .",
    "such features clearly show that along the minor axis stars participate in the high - speed elongated motions , which is consistent with the expectation from the @xmath3 anti - correlation discussed in section  [ subsec : h3h4 ] . in spite of the differences in their sizes and pattern speeds , the inner bar in the s2b model and the large - scale bar in the sb model present similar @xmath91 and @xmath92 enhancements along the major and minor axis , respectively . from this point of view , inner bars have qualitatively similar intrinsic motions as large - scale bars , being essentially scaled - down versions of normal large - scale bars .",
    "if that were the case , we would expect that the inner bar exhibits similar @xmath2 features as large - scale bars and lacking @xmath2-humps . however , as shown in the rightmost column in fig .",
    "[ fig : s2bcylib ] , the inner bar presents @xmath5-humps on its minor axis , while @xmath5 smoothly decreases outward in the sb model .",
    "therefore , the @xmath2-humps seen in fig .  [ fig : s2bsigma ] must be related to the @xmath5-humps , as they are the only difference with the sb model .    to better understand @xmath2-humps appearing in s2bs , because the bar is a symmetric structure , it is more convenient to analyse the contributions of the parallel ( @xmath94 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath95 ) components with respect to the inner bar . in fig .",
    "[ fig : s2bcart ] the inner bar is aligned with the @xmath48-axis ; thus @xmath94 and @xmath95 are equal to @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively .",
    "as shown here , @xmath95 humps are present on the minor axis , while the elliptical @xmath94 peak is aligned with the bar .",
    "when the inner bar is parallel to the lon , the line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath1 is mainly contributed by @xmath95 and @xmath5 , by @xmath98 . at small inclination ,",
    "@xmath1 is determined by @xmath5 , while @xmath95 becomes more and more important with increasing inclination . because both @xmath95 and @xmath5 have significant humps at the minor axis , @xmath2-humps are present at any inclination when the inner bar is parallel with the lon .",
    "when the inner bar is perpendicular to the lon , the @xmath1 is contributed by @xmath94 and @xmath5 , by @xmath99 . because the @xmath94 enhancement is aligned with the major axis of the inner bar ,",
    "while @xmath5 humps appear on the minor axis , the combination of @xmath94 and @xmath5 makes @xmath1 quite axisymmetric at intermediate inclinations .",

    "[ fig : s2bsigma ]",
    ".    therefore , the @xmath95 humps and @xmath94 peak appearing on the minor and major axis , respectively , are normal kinematics of stellar bars .",
    "the properties of observed @xmath1-humps can be explained by the superimposition between @xmath5-humps and such normal kinematics of bars .",

    ", we show that the existence of a inner bar alone can explain the observed kinematics of s2bs , especially @xmath2-humps / hollows and positive @xmath4 rings .",
    "our s2b model did not include the kinematic effect of a nuclear disk which is well known as a mechanism for reducing @xmath2 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is no doubt that a dynamically cooler nuclear disk , forming from the inflow of gas , can cause central @xmath2 drops .",
    "being embedded in a dynamically hotter bar or bulge , @xmath2 is lower over the projected regions of the nuclear disk , while beyond the nuclear disk @xmath2 is relatively larger . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : atlas3dno ] , is a prototypical example of the kinematics of a strong nuclear disk .",
    "@xcite compared this galaxy extensively with their @xmath0-body+gas simulation . within the projected nuclear disk ,",
    "the reduced @xmath2 value in is quite flat except for the very central regions , which is consistent with the @xmath0-body+gas simulation described in @xcite .",
    "the relatively larger @xmath2 on the minor axis may give an impression of `` @xmath2-humps '' perpendicular to the lon .",
    "without a nuclear disk , the kinematics of the s2b model are mainly dominated by the velocity dispersion . for and",
    ", the nuclear disk causes significant local minima and maxima in @xmath8 fields and an @xmath3 anti - correlation , while we can not see any clear effects of the nuclear disk in the @xmath2 maps .",
    "the @xmath2 features can be well matched by the s2b model without a nuclear disk , which suggests that such nuclear disks may not efficiently reduce the @xmath2 value in these s2bs .",
    "the nuclear disk in , if it exists , seems even weaker than in , thus it may not be sufficient for forming @xmath2-hollows ( or @xmath2-humps ) as large as 30 km / s . although we can not rule out the scenario that @xmath2-humps are caused by a nuclear disk , the s2b model does share similar kinematic features with .",
    "it is reasonable to consider as a potential s2b candidate .",
    "further numerical simulations are required to better quantify the kinematic effect of a dynamically cold nuclear disk , especially for nuclear - disk - bar systems .",
    "this study sheds new light on the kinematic properties of double - barred galaxies . using well - resolved , self - consistent simulations ,",
    "we have studied the kinematic properties of double - barred galaxies in comparison to single - barred galaxies . by quantifying the losvds with gauss - hermite moments",
    ", we find that many significant kinematic features are closely associated with the inner bar .",

    "generally , @xmath2-humps evolve and oscillate together with the inner bar .",
    "based on the analysis of intrinsic motions of bars , we show that the inner bar is essentially a scale - down version of normal large - scale bars from the kinematic point of view .",
    "the only difference is the @xmath5-humps appearing on the minor axis of the inner bar .",
    "combined with @xmath94 enhancements and @xmath95 humps produced in normal bars , @xmath5-humps are the key to generating the observed @xmath2-humps in s2bs . the isovelocity contours are significantly distorted . however , at the central regions , the kinematic major axis is only slightly distorted toward the opposite direction with respect to the inner bars .",
    "the most significant asymmetric twists are present at intermediate radii , in the transition region between the two bars instead of the photometric end of the inner bar . because of the elongated streaming motions in bars , some non - gaussian features appear .",
    "the outer bar exhibits an @xmath3 correlation , as expected .",
    "however , in the central regions , @xmath9 becomes anti - correlated with @xmath8 as a result of the increasing dominance of the inner bar .",
