    "the epoch of cosmological reionization , and the nature of the ionizing sources bear fundamental cosmological importance , but are yet unknown . in contrast , we have a better understanding of how the reionization might have happened : individual hii regions , whether around galaxies or quasars ( or sources of other nature ) , start out as isolated islands , eventually overlap to fill the universe and complete the reionization process ( aaron & wingert 1972 ; shapiro & giroux 1987 ; gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; haiman & loeb 1998 ; miralda - escud et al .",
    "1999 ) . in this _ letter _",
    "we suggest that it may be possible to directly probe the structure of an hii region around a bright quasar before the reionization is complete .",
    "although we do not necessarily have to identify the primary reionization sources with quasars , the existence of bright quasars at high redshift is supported by the recent discovery of the very bright quasar at @xmath1 in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; fan 2000 ; f00 hereafter ) .    to study the size and structure of an individual strmgren sphere",
    ", we propose to utilize the observed profile of the quasar s emission line .",
    "when a source is embedded in a neutral igm , its emission line suffers from strong absorption by the damping wing of the resonance absorption of the intervening neutral igm ( miralda - escud 1998 ) . as a result , the photons are absorbed and re  emitted multiple times in the igm , resulting in an extended , low ",
    "surface brightness line , which is difficult to observe ( loeb & rybicki 1999 ) .",
    "in contrast , if the source is surrounded by a large hii region , the photons can escape absorption , provided they redshift out of resonance before they reach the boundary of the hii region . in this _",
    "letter _ , we show that a sufficiently bright quasar placed at @xmath2 can produce a sufficiently large strmgren sphere to render its emission line detectable , using the _ next generation space telescope ( ngst ) _ , as well as high spectral resolution ground based telescopes such as keck and the hobby - eberly ( het ) telescopes . throughout this _ letter _",
    ", we adopt a flat @xmath3cdm background cosmology dominated by a cosmological constant and cold dark matter , with density parameters @xmath4 , and hubble constant @xmath5 .",
    "according to the classical definition in stellar astronomy , a strmgren sphere is an hii region around an individual , ionizing - photon - emitting o / b star , within which the rate of recombinations exactly balances the emission rate @xmath6 of ionizing photons from the star .",
    "the radius @xmath7 of the strmgren sphere is given by @xmath8^{1/3 } , \\label{eq : rs}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the hydrogen recombination coefficient at @xmath10k , and @xmath11 is the mean squared hydrogen density within @xmath7 .",
    "an analogous situation arises on much larger scales , for cosmological ionizing sources such as galaxies and quasars ( shapiro & giroux 1987 ) .",
    "there are , however , important differences between the stellar and cosmological case .",
    "the most important one for our purposes is that the hydrogen recombination time in the igm is longer than the hubble time at the relevant epochs ( @xmath12 ) and the quasar lifetime . as a result , the size @xmath7 of the _ equilibrium _ strmgren sphere is large , but is never reached in practice before the ionizing source turns off .",
    "the radius @xmath13 of the ionized region around a steady source of age @xmath14 is then simply @xmath15^{1/3 } , \\label{eq : rt}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the mean hydrogen density within @xmath13 .",
    "a second difference is that in the stellar case , the strmgren sphere is static if the luminosity of the source is constant , whereas in the quasar case the sphere around a long  lived quasar can evolve due to the evolution of density around a quasar ( both mean density and clumping factor ) as well as the accumulation of ionizing photons ( equation 2 and equation 4 below ) , even if the source luminosity remains constant . to fully take these effects into account , one needs to solve the equation of motion for the ionization front , @xmath17 , with the following equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the hubble constant at @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the mean clumping factor of ionized gas within @xmath17 .",
    "the three terms on the right side in equation  [ eq : ri ] account for the hubble expansion , the ionizations by newly produced photons , and recombinations ( shapiro & giroux 1987 ; haiman & loeb 1997 ) , respectively . note that equation  [ eq : ri ] predicts an initial phase of superluminal expansion for the i  front , i.e. when @xmath22 . ignoring any clumping or recombinations",
    ", this phase would last for @xmath23^{-3/2}$ ] years ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ eq : rt ] ) ; a potentially significant effect , since the quasar found by f00 in the sdss survey implies an intrinsic ionizing emissivity of @xmath24 . nevertheless , the ly@xmath25 photons emitted by the quasar lag behind the i ",
    "front during the phase of relativistic expansion , and will only see the opacity once the front slows down to be subluminal . as a result , for our purposes , the apparent size of the hii region is always given by equation  [ eq : ri ] .",
    "in practice , we find that the apparent size of a quasar strmgren sphere is primarily determined by the total number of ionizing photons emitted . assuming that the quasar luminosity @xmath6 is constant , the solution of equation  [ eq : ri ] is accurately described by @xmath13 given in eq .",
    "[ eq : rt ] .",
    "gas clumping is unlikely to significantly change this answer . as a specific example , with the ionizing photon emissivity of the sdss quasar , and for @xmath26 , we find that @xmath17 would be reduced by 10% at @xmath27 , and by 50% at @xmath28 .",
    "cosmological simulations indicate that the value of @xmath29 is likely to be significantly below @xmath30 ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) .",
    "the main purpose of this _ letter _ is to assess the effect of the quasar s hii region on the observed profile of its ly@xmath25 line . consider a source located at @xmath31 before reionization is complete , whose age is @xmath14 .",
    "the source is assumed to be surrounded by a spherical hii region of size @xmath32 , but is otherwise embedded in a neutral igm .",
    "the source is also assumed to emit a ly@xmath25 emission line , which is subsequently reprocessed by the opacity of the intervening neutral igm , as well as of the residual neutral hydrogen within the hii region itself .    the optical depth between the source and the observer at @xmath33 , at the observed wavelength @xmath34 , is given by @xmath35 , \\label{eq : dtaudz}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the line element in the assumed @xmath3cdm cosmology , @xmath37 is the neutral hydrogen density , and @xmath38 is the ly@xmath25 absorption cross  section .",
    "the reionization redshift is assumed conservatively to be @xmath39 , but the precise value ( as well as the details of the reionization process ) is irrelevant here , since we are only sensitive to the optical depth near the source redshift @xmath40 , where the igm is assumed to be still fully neutral .",
    "it is useful to divide the range of integration in equation  [ eq : dtaudz ] into two parts , to reflect the contributions to the optical depth from within ( @xmath41 ) and outside ( @xmath42 ) the hii region , where @xmath43 is the redshift somewhat below @xmath40 , corresponding to the boundary of the hii region ( @xmath44/r_h[z_s]$ ] , where @xmath45 $ ] is the size of the cosmological horizon at @xmath40 ) .",
    "the ly@xmath25 absorption cross ",
    "section is assumed to be described by a numerically computed voigt profile ( see eq .  6 of press & rybicki 1993 ) . the gas temperature for this profile",
    "is taken to be @xmath10k within the hii region , and @xmath46^{-2}~{\\rm k}$ ] outside it . , and cools adiabatically thereafter . ] outside the hii region , the neutral hydrogen density is assumed to follow the igm density , @xmath47^{3}~{\\rm cm^{-3}}$ ] . inside the hii region , the neutral hydrogen density depends on the ionized fraction .",
    "assuming photoionization equilibrium ( justified for the source lifetimes of @xmath48 yr considered here ) , and that the gas is highly ionized , the neutral hydrogen fraction @xmath49 at the quasar - centric radius @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 here @xmath52 is the intrinsic luminosity of the source in @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the ionization threshold and cross section of hydrogen , with the luminosity weighted cross section being @xmath56^{-1 } \\label{eq : sigeff}\\ ] ] and equal to @xmath57 for the elvis et al .",
    "( 1994 ) template spectrum ( the same value would be obtained for a power law spectrum with a slope of @xmath58 ) .",
    "the resulting neutral hydrogen fraction is @xmath59 this equation applies within the optically thin central region of the strmgren sphere where @xmath60 , and shows that for bright sources of interest here , this region is highly ionized . near the boundary of the hii region , the neutral fraction rapidly increases to unity , where the @xmath60 condition breaks down and equation",
    "[ eq : x2 ] becomes invalid .",
    "however , this does not affect the results shown below for the following reasons .",
    "first , the flux transmission shortward of the wavelength that we are concerned with occurs in regions with optical depth @xmath61 or @xmath62 .",
    "second , the optical depth longward of the wavelength is roughly @xmath63 for the cosmological parameters adopted here ( miralda - escud 1998 ) , and is dominated by neutral ( @xmath64 ) igm outside the strmgren sphere . therefore , the boundary region of the strmgren sphere does not affect the results in a sensitive way .",
    "we assume that the jump from @xmath65 to unity takes place as a step function at the radius @xmath32 .",
    "figure  [ fig : tau ] shows the optical depth around the line for a quasar at @xmath66 .",
    "the left panel shows that , for a bright quasar like that of f00 , the optical depth longward of the wavelength is nearly independent of the clumping factor , simply because the optical depth in that region is dominated by the damping wing of the neutral igm ( dotted curves in the left panel ) outside the strmgren sphere , whose radius is insensitive to @xmath29 as long as @xmath67 ( see  2 ) .",
    "the situation is dramatically different for a fainter quasar as shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : tau ] ; because the hii region is much smaller , the red damping wing produced by the neutral igm outside the strmgren sphere start to reflect the size of the sphere hence the age of the quasar .",
    "the dependence of the red damping wing on the clumping factor is very weak , because the contribution from the residual neutral hydrogen within the strmgren sphere is small .    on the other hand ,",
    "the optical depth shortward of the wavelength within the stretch of the strmgren sphere is always dominated by the residual neutral hydrogen inside the strmgren sphere ( dashed curves ) , and therefore is proportional to @xmath29 ( equation  [ eq : x2 ] ) , in sharp contrast with the situation at the longward of the wavelength . however , the optical depth shortward of the wavelength it is quite insensitive to @xmath14 ( equation  [ eq : x2 ] ) .",
    "let us now translate the theoretical illustration in figure  [ fig : tau ] to observable spectra of quasars around the emission line shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "a logarithmic ordinate is used to better show the flux over many orders of magnitude down to the expected noise level ( although the spectral line may appear misleadingly flat ) .",
    "we adopt the black hole ( bh ) mass and luminosity inferred from the quasar at @xmath1 observed by f00 and place it either at @xmath68 or @xmath66 in the top two panels ; another quasar with one tenth of this luminosity is used for the two bottom panels . in all cases ,",
    "the profile of the emission line is assumed to be gaussian with a half - width of @xmath69 km / s , and with a central flux that is twice the continuum . the random noise shown at the bottom of each panel in figure  [ fig : spectra ]",
    "is estimated assuming a @xmath70second integration with the _ ngst _ ( see http://augusta.stsci.edu for details on the expected backgrounds ) with a spectral resolution of r=10,000 . obviously , it is advantageous to use high resolution spectroscopy to maximize the number of pixels that probe the structure of the hii region on the blue side of the emission line ( especially for faint and/or very young quasars ) . at spectral resolutions",
    "this high , the dominant absolute ( _ not relative _ ) noise is either the poisson photon noise ( for bright sources with @xmath71 ) or the detector noise ( for fainter sources ) , rather than the zodiacal light or sky background ( see expressions for noise in gillett & mountain 1998 ) . a ground based telescope such keck or het with sufficient spectral resolution should therefore work just as well as _",
    "ngst_.    a rich amount of information is contained in the profile of the line .",
    "we see that the red side of the emission line is largely transmitted even for the fainter quasar adopted at the bottom panels , consistent with figure 1 showing an optical depth of @xmath72 there ( except near the wavelength for the case with @xmath73yr , where the radius of the strmgren sphere is sufficiently small that the damping wing of the neutral igm contributes an optical depth significantly above unity . ) for the brighter quasar shown in the top panels the transmission on the red side is insensitive to either @xmath14 or @xmath29 , whereas for the fainter quasar shown in the bottom panels the transmission on the red side is sensitive to @xmath14 but not to @xmath29 .",
    "it is therefore possible to measure the lifetime of a relatively faint quasar ( perhaps the majority of the quasars belong to this category ) before reionization is complete .",
    "the primary uncertain factor is the intrinsic emission profile .",
    "the blue side of the emission line is not completely absorbed .",
    "on the contrary , we see in the top panels of figure  [ fig : spectra ] that for a quasar observed by f00 with @xmath74 yr there is a large range @xmath75 where the flux is at least ten times above the noise ( s / n=10 ) .",
    "even if the quasar is ten times fainter , one should still be able to detect of order several tens of spectral pixels if @xmath76 yr ( assuming @xmath77 ) .",
    "more interestingly , the extent of the flux transmission @xmath78 on the blue side is a strong function of @xmath29 but a very weak function of @xmath14 .",
    "the idealized case in figure  [ fig : spectra ] shows the mean flux processed through a relatively gently fluctuating medium , with no saturated lines [ so that @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is a known constant of order @xmath81 . an actual observed flux distribution on the blue side may contain numerous absorption features due to density fluctuations on small scales . in the limit when clumping is caused by highly overdense regions with a small volume filling factor ,",
    "the absorption lines saturate , and the mean transmission could increase , rather than decrease , for increasing values of @xmath29 ( since a larger fraction of the line of sight probes underdense voids ) . in order to adequately model the absorption profile and to make use of the additional available information , numerical simulations are needed , which we will explore in a subsequent paper . in either case , the blue side of the line will provide a potentially powerful tool to directly measure the small scale power at the quasar redshift .    since the intrinsic emission of a quasar",
    "is expected to be significantly broader than the width of the blue side of the absorbed spectrum , the latter should not sensitively depend on the exact intrinsic width of the unabsorbed emission line .",
    "since the red side of the profile traces the intrinsic profile well for a bright quasar , it is possible that fitting the entire observed profile significantly removes the uncertainty of the unknown intrinsic profile , as long as it is reasonably symmetric and sufficiently broad .",
    "hogan , anderson , & rugers ( 1997 ) and anderson ( 1999 ) have made the point that the quasar lifetime and ionizing background from the proximity effect for a heiii region around the quasar ( at lower redshift ) is related and showed that a large heiii region can be created by a bright quasar with a reasonable lifetime .",
    "they indicated that for a bright quasar of age @xmath82yr a large heiii region of size @xmath83  can be generated .    finally , we point out that the existence of a useful hii region around a quasar requires only that the reionization is not complete . when individual hii regions overlap , the universe is not yet completely reionized , due to the travel delay of ionizing photons from other sources . in other words ,",
    "the emission profile that we show above should exist even at times significantly later than the overlapping epoch , but before the average gunn  peterson optical depth of the igm is reduced to below unity ( note that the latter can take a significant time , see , e.g. gnedin 2000 ) .",
    "this could potentially significantly reduce the redshift of quasars that should show useful transmission profiles .",
    "a quasar one tenth as luminous as that recently reported by f00 , if placed in the neutral igm at @xmath84 before cosmological reionization , generates a large hii island ( a strmgren sphere ) .",
    "we show that for such a quasar a substantial fraction of the flux on both the blue and red sides of the emission wavelength can be transmitted . for the range of wavelengths around the wavelength where significant transmission of flux occurs",
    ", the red damping wing of the intervening neutral igm outside the strmgren sphere dominates the optical depth longward of the wavelength , whereas the residual neutral hydrogen inside the ( highly ionized ) strmgren sphere dominates the optical depth shortward of the wavelength .",
    "while the flux longward of the wavelength is not substantially suppressed to a large offset in wavelength ( @xmath85a ) , the blue side of the emission line is more absorbed than the red side and displays a distinct profile that drops sharply with decreasing wavelength .",
    "nevertheless , the flux on the blue side is clearly detectable even for a quasar 10 times fainter than that found by f00 .",
    "we show that _ ngst _ as well as large ground - based , high spectral resolution telescopes with a spectral resolution of @xmath77 should be able to provide such a detection .",
    "two applications of such a partially absorbed emission line are suggested .",
    "first , for a relatively faint quasar ( for example , one tenth as luminous as that found by f00 ) , the red side of the line profile depends mostly on the age of the quasar and therefore can be used to infer it .",
    "the main uncertainty is the unknown intrinsic profile .",
    "second , for bright quasars , the blue side of the line profile is also detectable , and depends only very weakly on the lifetime of a quasar but very strongly on the density fluctuations the gas around the quasar .",
    "therefore , one can use it to directly measure the fluctuation of gas on small scales at high redshift .",
    "this may provide a unique opportunity to probe the small - scale power at very high redshift , where competing cosmological models differ most .",
