    "the brownian motion of colloid particles and macromolecules is correlated through hydrodynamic interactions , i.e. , flows that the motion induces in the host liquid @xcite . in an unconfined suspension",

    "the so - called stokeslet approximation , equating the coupling mobility with the flow velocity per unit force , strictly holds only when @xmath4 is much smaller than _ both _ the inter - particle distance @xmath16 and the slab width @xmath7 , whereupon @xmath81 . if @xmath4 is much smaller than @xmath16 but comparable to @xmath7 then , no matter how large the inter - particle distance may be , we have @xmath82 .",
    "this is due to the second term in faxen s law , @xmath83 . in an unconfined liquid it contributes a negligible correction to the stokeslet limit , @xmath84 , whereas in q2d the newly introduced length @xmath7 leads to a significant correction of @xmath85 .",

    "the hydrodynamic coupling derived above implies that their motions be correlated according to equation ( [ d_exp ] ) , with @xmath91 .",
    "thus , the dimensionless couplings @xmath92 can be directly measured from the statistics of particle trajectories .",
    "these measurements for different area fractions @xmath14 are presented in figure [ fig_pair ] .",
    "the large - distance behaviour for all @xmath14 values fits well the @xmath93 dependence of equations ( [ delta_l ] ) and ( [ delta_t ] ) with @xmath94 .",

    "we find @xmath96 , which is only slightly smaller than the value for a vanishing confinement ratio , @xmath97 .",
    "as the area fraction @xmath14 is increased , the pair hydrodynamic interaction should become affected by the presence of other particles . in unconfined suspensions hydrodynamic screening sets in at distances much larger than the typical inter - particle distance and renormalizes the interaction by a concentration - dependent prefactor @xcite .",
    "similarly , one expects the pair interaction in q2d to have the form of equations ( [ delta_l ] ) and ( [ delta_t ] ) yet with a modified , @xmath14-dependent prefactor .",
    "we find , however , that this is not the case , as is clearly demonstrated in figure [ fig_pair](e ) .",
    "consider again particle 1 , located at the origin and exerting a force @xmath37 parallel to the confining surfaces .",
    "this creates a far flow velocity @xmath98 according to equation ( [ v_i ] ) which , in the absence of any other particle , entrains particle 2 at @xmath62 with velocity @xmath99 given by equation ( [ u2 ] ) .",
    "we now introduce particle 3 at @xmath100 .",
    "it obstructs the flow and thus modifies @xmath71 .",
    "the particle being force - free , the lowest force - distribution moment it can exert is a force dipole , @xmath101 where the integration is over the surface of particle 3 , and @xmath102 is a dimensionless factor of order 1 .",
    "the force dipole , located at @xmath103 , changes the flow velocity at @xmath104 by @xmath105 this holds regardless of confinement . in an unconfined system the far flows decay as @xmath2 , leading to @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "then , upon integration over the third - particle position @xmath103 , one gets a correction @xmath3 , which renormalizes the coefficient of the bare @xmath2 interaction . in q2d",
    ", however , the situation is different .",
    "first , we realize that , due to the vanishing of @xmath49 and the symmetry of the mid - plane , only the terms @xmath48 of @xmath108 in equation ( [ sij ] ) are non - zero .",
    "then , since the far flows decay as @xmath90 , one gets @xmath109 which , upon integration over @xmath110 , yields a correction @xmath111 . at large distances",
    "this is much smaller than the bare pair interaction ( @xmath112 ) and will be neglected .",
    "since the force dipole created by particle 3 has a negligible far - field effect in q2d , we proceed to the third moment of the force distribution , @xmath113 where @xmath114 is another dimensionless prefactor depending only on the confinement ratio @xmath46 . in principle , @xmath114 ( and @xmath102 ) could be calculated using the _ short - range _ hydrodynamics in a q2d geometry @xcite , yet we shall not pursue this technically complicated calculation here .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath49 and the mid - plane symmetry make all terms @xmath115 , for which one or three of the indices are @xmath64 , vanish .",
    "in addition , the terms with @xmath116 are negligible at large distances compared to those with two @xmath64 indices , since they involve two additional powers of @xmath117 .",
    "we are thus left with @xmath118 , @xmath119 , yielding through equations ( [ v_i ] ) and ( [ tijk ] ) @xmath120 in the integration we have assumed again a parabolic vertical profile , @xmath67 @xcite . note that within this assumption the similar leading terms in @xmath117 from all higher moments of the force distribution , involving higher @xmath64 derivatives , vanish .",
    "the moment @xmath121 changes the flow velocity at @xmath122 by @xmath123 combining equations ( [ v_i ] ) , ( [ faxen1 ] ) , ( [ tijk2 ] ) and ( [ deltavt ] ) , we find the correction to the velocity of particle 2 due to particle 3 , @xmath124 where the reference to @xmath11 is hereafter omitted for brevity .",
    "equation ( [ deltau2 ] ) yields the correction to @xmath71 given a certain position @xmath110 of particle 3 .",
    "we now wish to average this correction over all possible @xmath110 , @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the probability density of finding particle 3 at @xmath110 given that particle 2 is at @xmath122 and particle 1 is at the origin . employing the superposition approximation",

    "we have assumed that the monolayer of particles is a disordered 2d liquid , and thus the pair correlation has no angular dependence .",
    "using equations ( [ deltau2])([p ] ) , and specializing to the relation between @xmath131 and @xmath74 , we obtain the average corrections to the coupling mobilities , @xmath132[\\delta_{xx}(\\brho-\\brho')\\delta_{xx}(\\brho ' ) +   \\nonumber\\\\    & & \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\     \\delta_{xy}(\\brho-\\brho')\\delta_{xy}(\\brho ' ) ] , \\label{deltadelta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the longitudinal and transverse couplings are obtained , as in section [ sec_pair ] , by taking @xmath76 and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "[ note that equation ( [ deltadelta ] ) , for @xmath133 , has exactly the same form as the one used in @xcite based on a less detailed analysis . ]",
    "a brief examination of equation ( [ deltadelta ] ) raises two expectations .",
    "first , the integrand scales as @xmath134 which , upon integration over @xmath110 , is expected to yield a correction @xmath112 , i.e. , a renormalization of the prefactor of the bare coupling in accord with hydrodynamic screening .",
    "second , since the fields @xmath135 decay slowly with distance , one expects features ( oscillations ) in the static correlation function @xmath136 to be smoothed by integration and thus be manifest only weakly in the dynamic coupling . as is shown below , due to the unique shape of the far flow in q2d , both of these expectations turn out to be false .",
    "the convolution integral of equation ( [ deltadelta ] ) is worked out in the appendix .",
    "the result is @xmath137 , \\label{deltadelta2}\\ ] ] where @xmath138 , and the results for the longitudinal and transverse couplings are identical .",
    "equation ( [ deltadelta2 ] ) is the main result of the current work .",
    "it gives the leading three - body correction to the pair hydrodynamic interaction in q2d .",
    "if static pair correlations are neglected , @xmath133 , this correction _ vanishes _ , as was presented in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the correction for a nonzero @xmath136 , although finite , is short - range : since the suspension is disordered , the static pair correlation @xmath136 decays exponentially beyond an equilibrium correlation length .",
    "thus , the correction in equation ( [ deltadelta2 ] ) decreases with distance much faster than the @xmath90 decay of the bare interaction .",
    "this remarkable disagreement with the usual notion of hydrodynamic screening ( i.e. , concentration - dependent change of the prefactor at large distances ) , known from unconfined systems , is fully confirmed by our experimental measurements as is seen in figure [ fig_pair](e ) .    the first term in equation ( [ deltadelta2 ] )",
    "represents the leading correction to equations ( [ delta_l ] ) and ( [ delta_t ] ) as the inter - particle distance @xmath16 decreases .",
    "it scales as @xmath139 and , therefore , should be in phase with the oscillations of the static pair correlation .",
    "the second term is smaller , of order @xmath140 .",
    "higher - order corrections , which have not been treated here , come from several sources .",
    "corrections of @xmath141 arise from the integration in equation ( [ deltadelta ] ) ( see appendix ) , as well as the force - dipole terms ( @xmath142 ) discussed above .",
    "terms of @xmath143 come from the approximation employed in equation ( [ p ] ) .",
    "finally , as @xmath16 becomes comparable to @xmath7 , short - distance hydrodynamics set in and the far flow ( [ v_i ] ) , on which our entire analysis has been relying , should be corrected @xcite .",
    "thus , the expression formulated in equation ( [ deltadelta2 ] ) is relevant to suspensions of sufficiently high concentration , such that the static pair correlation @xmath136 is significant at distances @xmath144 where the far flow holds .    to compare equation ( [ deltadelta2 ] ) with experiment",
    "we need the static pair correlation function for the various values of area fraction .",
    "these functions are directly measurable from snapshots of the q2d suspensions such as the one shown in figure [ fig_system](a ) .",
    "( for more details , see @xcite . )",
    "the results are presented in figure [ fig_h ] .",
    "the measured @xmath136 are subsequently used in equation ( [ deltadelta2 ] ) to calculate the correction to the pair interaction .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig_wiggles ] . with the coefficient @xmath145 of",
    "the bare interaction already found , there is only one unknown coefficient , @xmath146 , fitted as @xmath147 .",
    "working back the definitions of the various coefficients introduced during the calculation , we find the coefficient of the third force moment for our experimental system ( @xmath59 ) to be @xmath148 .",
    "comparing the fits in figure [ fig_wiggles ] with those in figure [ fig_pair ] , we see that the introduction of the concentration - dependent correction leads to a good agreement between the theory and the measured longitudinal interaction not only at asymptotically large distances ( as was presented in @xcite ) but also at intermediate distances , @xmath149 .",
    "as anticipated , equation ( [ deltadelta2 ] ) is particularly successful for the high - concentration systems [ figure [ fig_wiggles](c , d ) ] , where oscillations related to @xmath136 are clearly observed ( compare with figure [ fig_h ] ) .",
    "the discrepancies seen in figure [ fig_wiggles ] between the theory and experiment for @xmath150 can be attributed to several factors , as discussed above , which have not been included in the current analysis .",
    "our calculation has yielded an identical correction to the transverse pair interaction , @xmath151 .",
    "this does not agree with the measured transverse interaction , which does not exhibit a wiggly behaviour similar to that of @xmath152 ( see figure [ fig_pair ] ) .",
    "thus , we can not currently offer an accurate analysis of the concentration effect on the transverse interaction at intermediate and short distances . a possible reason for the difference between the longitudinal and transverse modes may lie in the higher sensitivity of the latter to short - range hydrodynamics .",
    "to demonstrate this difference we show in figure [ fig_stokeslet ] the deviations of the longitudinal and transverse bare interactions from their large - distance behaviour in the limit of very small particles ( @xmath45 ) , as obtained from an exact solution @xcite .",
    "the departure of the transverse interaction from its asymptotic behaviour is found to be more pronounced than that of the longitudinal one .",
    "the correlated dynamics of particles in q2d suspensions are very different from those in unconfined systems .",
    "confinement affects the decay of the dynamic correlation with distance ( @xmath0 instead of @xmath2 ) as well as its sign ( the correlation transverse to the line connecting the particles becomes negative ) . in the current work we have focused on the effect of concentration , i.e. , the presence of additional particles , on the pair interaction . unlike unconfined suspensions , where the large - distance coupling changes with concentration , in q2d suspensions increasing the concentration has no effect at large inter - particle distances ( no hydrodynamic screening ) .",
    "the qualitatively different behaviour of q2d suspensions has been theoretically and experimentally corroborated .",
    "it stems from the dipolar shape of the far flow induced by particle motion . as argued in @xcite , the key property of this flow",
    "is that it is governed by the displacement of liquid mass rather than the diffusion of liquid momentum .",
    "concentration - dependent effects on the pair correlation do set in in q2d suspensions , yet only at intermediate and short distances .",
    "the range of these corrections is determined by the larger of two lengths : the range of the static pair correlation @xmath136 of the suspension and the confinement width @xmath7 . in the former case , which is valid for sufficiently high concentration ,",
    "the spatial dependence of the dynamic coupling reflects the features of the static pair correlation . in this case",
    "we have been able to provide a quantitative account for the concentration effect on the longitudinal interaction at intermediate distances , which is in good agreement with the experimental measurements . in the latter case ( range of @xmath153 shorter than @xmath7 )",
    ", the correction depends on short - range hydrodynamics whose analysis lies beyond the scope of the current work .",
    "we have not treated the effect of particle motion perpendicular to the bounding surfaces .",
    "such fluctuations must exist in practice , yet our results suggest that they have a minor effect at large and intermediate distances .",
    "this is expected since the flows produced by perpendicular fluctuations decay exponentially with distance and thus have only a short - range effect @xcite .",
