    "the positive scale factor @xmath10 can be interpreted as the three - cylinder s radius , but its role here is to provide the skyrme model with additional length scale that can be compared with the characteristic soliton size .",
    "this simple field - theoretical setup leads to a single equation for the skyrme hedgehog that can be solved exactly in three spatial dimensions .",
    "the analogous solution on the metric three - sphere ( @xmath3 ) can be found only by numerical integration .    by considering fields with appropriate asymptotics ,",
    "@xmath1(with attached two `` points at infinity '' ) may be topologically identified with @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath3case , the metric geometry of @xmath1is not isotropic  the sectional gauss curvature of @xmath1is direction dependent .",
    "nevertheless , these two geometries are conformally identical : @xmath11 ( length scales on @xmath1and on @xmath3are assumed equal ) .",

    "this conformal identification of metric geometries of @xmath1and @xmath3allows for identification of the translation symmetry killing vector @xmath13 on @xmath1with the conformal symmetry killing vector @xmath14 on @xmath3 .",
    "the conformal symmetry killing vector is related to bifurcations of static spherically symmetric hedgehogs on @xmath3at characteristic critical length scales . in particular , at the critical radius @xmath15 , the @xmath16-skyrmion ( @xmath17 ) on @xmath3separates from the identity map @xmath18@xmath19 by a conformal deformation of this map @xcite , namely , in the limit @xmath20 , the shape function of @xmath17 reads @xmath21 , @xmath22 . can be found with arbitrary accuracy by perturbations ( however , the resulting series seem to have finite radius of convergence in @xmath23 , presumably bounded by @xmath24 , therefore one can not reconstruct the energy of flat space 1-skyrmion by taking the limit @xmath25 ) . to the leading order this perturbative calculation confirms the discussed above conformal deformation of the identity solution @xcite . ] note that @xmath26 is also the eigenfunction corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue of the hessian evaluated at @xmath18 @xcite . the eigenvalue vanishes at @xmath27 and is negative for @xmath28 and positive for @xmath29 .",
    "the conformal deformation of @xmath18 generated by @xmath30 is thus energetically preferable for @xmath28 . for such @xmath28",
    "it is the @xmath17 which minimizes the energy functional .",
    "on @xmath1the situation is qualitatively different .",
    "a deformation of a solution generated by @xmath13 is simply a translation which is also a symmetry of the space",
    ". this deformation leaves energy of the 1-skyrmion on @xmath1and the boundary conditions at infinity unchanged .",
    "for that reason one should not expect bifurcations similar to that on @xmath3to occur on @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , by contrast with the @xmath3case , one may also expect that the 1-skyrmion on @xmath1should uniformly tend to a harmonic map of the related sigma model on @xmath1 .",
    "translation symmetry of skyrme equations on @xmath1enables one to use the conserved current associated with this symmetry as the first integral of these equations .",
    "in particular , it can be shown that static , spherically symmetric , finite energy and topologically nontrivial hedgehog solutions with topological charge other than @xmath31 can not exist on @xmath1 .",
    "one can also easily examine properties of the 1-skyrmion , calculate its energy , and analyze its stability .",
    "remarkably , all this can be done without knowing the exact form of the 1-skyrmion s shape function .",
    "next , we construct an approximate formula for the 1-skyrmion s shape function , and finally we find its exact form .",
