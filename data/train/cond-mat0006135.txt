    "recent experiments by s. inouye _ et al .",
    "_ at mit @xcite have demonstrated the formation of atomic matter waves in a cigar - shaped bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) pumped by an off - resonant laser beam , together with highly directional scattering of light along the major axis of the condensate .",
    "this emission has been interpreted as superradiant rayleigh scattering , and some theoretical work describing this experiment has been recently published @xcite . in particular , the work of moore and meystre @xcite describes the rayleigh scattering in a bec using a model which extends the collective atomic recoil laser ( carl ) model originally proposed by bonifacio et al .",
    "@xcite to include a quantum - mechanical description of the centre - of - mass motion of the atoms in the condensate @xcite .",
    "the conclusions of ref.@xcite were that the original carl theory , which treats the atomic centre - of - mass motion classically , fails when the temperature of the atomic sample is below the recoil temperature @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the recoil frequency , @xmath2 is the atomic mass , @xmath3 is the difference between the pump and scattered wavevectors and @xmath4 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "however , the cubic dispersion relation derived in ref .",
    "@xcite reduces to that of the original semiclassical carl model for large atomic densities : more specifically , the quantum corrections to the classical motion are negligibly small when the carl parameter @xmath5 in the free electron laser ( fel ) limit @xcite , roughly interpreted as the average number of photons scattered per atom , is greater than one .",
    "this suggests that a fully quantum - mechanical description of the atomic centre - of - mass motion may not be necessary in order to describe the main experimental results of ref.@xcite , i.e. the temporal evolution of the scattered light intensity and the spatial grating in the condensate .",
    "we are aware that a semiclassical theory is necessarily limited in its description of the radiation statistics and the quantum degenerate nature of the condensate , which require a full quantum analysis . nevertheless , we consider the semiclassical approach useful in order to give an intuitive description of the physical mechanism underlying the observed effects .",
    "we stress however that in spite of its simplicity , the semiclassical model produces good quantitative agreement with the experimental results of ref.@xcite .",
    "the model described is bidimensional and semiclassical .",
    "we represent the cigar - shaped atomic sample as an ellipsoid with length @xmath6 and diameter @xmath7 , where @xmath8 as shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the sample is exposed to a classical plane wave radiation electric field @xmath9 , polarised along the @xmath10 axis and incident along the axis @xmath11 , with @xmath12 real and constant and where @xmath13 .",
    "we assume that the scattered radiation consists of two radiation pulses propagating along the @xmath14 axis , with electric fields polarised as the incident field : @xmath15 , \\label{field}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 are slowly varying complex amplitudes .",
    "the dominance of the scattering along the @xmath17 axis over that in other directions is due to the geometry of the atomic sample .",
    "the atomic sample is described as a collisionless gas of atoms , each with two internal energy levels .",
    "the internal evolution of each atom is described by the density matrix elements @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) for the lower , ( 1 ) , and upper , ( 2 ) , levels .",
    "the off - diagonal elements @xmath20 describe the dipole moment induced by the radiation fields via the relation @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the dipole matrix element .",
    "the diagonal elements @xmath23 and @xmath24 describe the probability of an atom being in the lower or in the upper level , respectively .",
    "the off - diagonal elements may be described conveniently as a sum of three polarisation waves : @xmath25 the dipole moment of each atom contributes to the macroscopic polarisation of the atomic sample described by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the atomic density .",
    "this polarisation is a source for the radiation field via maxwell s wave equation which yields , in the usual slowly varying envelope approximation ( svea ) , @xmath28 where we have neglected the terms proportional to @xmath29 .",
    "we assume that the atomic sample can be described as a collection of @xmath30 point particles with positions @xmath31 , so that @xmath32 . multiplying both sides by @xmath33 and integrating over the @xmath14 axis from @xmath34 to @xmath35 , where @xmath36 , eq.([maxwell ] ) yields @xmath37 where the upper sign corresponds to the first subscript and we have assumed the field amplitudes @xmath38 are spatially slowly varying over @xmath39 . assuming also that @xmath38 are independent of @xmath40 and @xmath41",
    ", we can integrate on the plane @xmath42 over the section @xmath43 of the condensate , so that eq.([max2 ] ) becomes @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the average density and @xmath46 .    in this model the atomic centre - of mass motion",
    "is treated classically , with each atom described as a point particle with a given position and momentum .",
    "the radiation fields drive the centre - of - mass motion of the atoms via the force @xmath47 neglecting the fast - varying temporal terms , the equations for the atomic velocity components are : @xmath48\\label{vy}\\\\ m\\frac{dv_z}{dt}&=&ik\\mu\\left\\ {   s_1^*{\\cal e}_1 -s_2^*{\\cal e}_2 + s_2^*{\\cal e}_1e^ { 2ikz } -s_1^*{\\cal e}_2e^{-2ikz } + s_0^*\\left [               { \\cal e}_1e^{ik(z - y ) }              -{\\cal e}_2e^{-ik(y+z ) }        \\right]-c.c .",

    "moreover , assuming that the scattering time scale is much longer than the relaxation time @xmath53 , we can adiabatically eliminate the atomic polarisations , i.e. @xmath54 , where @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the rabi frequency for the field @xmath57 and @xmath58 . with these approximations , eqs.([vy ] ) and ( [ vz ] ) yield : @xmath59\\label{vy:2}\\\\ m\\frac{dv_z}{dt}&=&i\\hbar k(\\omega_0/4\\delta ) \\left[\\omega_1 e^{ik(z - y)}+\\omega_2^ * e^{ik(z+y)}-c.c\\right ] + i(\\hbar k/2\\delta ) \\left[\\omega_1\\omega_2^ * e^{2ikz}-c.c\\right ] .",
    "\\label{vz:2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is seen that the interference between the pump and the scattered fields forms two bidimensional periodic potentials @xmath60 $ ] in the plane @xmath61 , where @xmath62 are the phases of the complex amplitudes @xmath38 .",
    "a weaker 1d potential @xmath63 $ ] forms along the @xmath14 axis due to the interference of the two counterpropagating scattered fields .",
    "if the pump intensity is large enough , we can assume @xmath64 and neglect the ponderomotive potential @xmath65 .",
    "then , eqs.([vy:2]),([vz:2 ] ) and ( [ max3 ] ) can be conveniently written in the following dimensionless form @xcite : @xmath66 , \\label{f2}\\\\ \\frac{\\partial a_{1,2}}{\\partial \\overline t}&\\pm & \\frac{\\partial a_{1,2}}{\\partial\\overline z}=\\langle e^{\\mp i\\theta_{1,2}}\\rangle \\label{f3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are scaled atomic position , atomic momentum and field amplitude variables respectively . the dimensionless time and space coordinates , @xmath70 and @xmath71 ,",
    "are scaled in terms of the collective recoil bandwidth , @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the single - atom recoil frequency and @xmath74 is the dimensionless carl parameter @xcite . at @xmath75 ,",
    "the atoms are assumed to be randomly distributed in position and have zero momentum , and the amplitudes of the scattered fields are set to zero .",
    "in this simple model the two scattered fields are uncoupled and symmetric . for each field ( 1,2 ) individually , eqs.([f1])-([f3 ] ) are formally identical to those which describe pulse propagation in a high gain free electron laser ( fel ) @xcite .",
    "it is already known that they admit a self - similar solution of the form @xmath76 , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 is the solution of a set of ordinary differential equations @xcite .",
    "this self - similar solution describes the superradiant emission of radiation pulses whose duration decreases in proportion to the fourth root of the peak intensity .",
    "the pulse shape can be approximated by a hyperbolic secant function , followed by some non - linear ` ringing ' , similar to that which occurs in superfluorescence from inverted two - level atoms @xcite .",
    "a simpler model can be obtained by approximating the spatial derivative in the field equation ( [ f3 ] ) by a damping term@xcite i.e. @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 is the transit time of the photon along the major axis of the condensate . in this approximation , the finite interaction time due to the escape of radiation from the atomic sample is represented by an incoherent decay of the field amplitude in the sample at a rate @xmath82 , half the inverse of the radiation ` lifetime ' in the atomic sample .",
    "a more general treatment where the radiation is scattered in a direction making an angle @xmath83 with respect to the @xmath14 axis should give @xmath84 $ ] @xcite .",
    "as @xmath8 , the radiation is least strongly damped along the major axis of the sample .",

    "a third - order analysis of the equations in the mean - field limit ( i.e. with radiation propagation modelled by the damping term ) gives the following approximate solution : @xmath88 \\label{sech}\\ ] ] and @xmath89 \\right\\ } , \\label{tanh}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is the delay time of the peak and @xmath91\\rangle$ ] is the initial bunching , which can be assumed to be @xmath92 for a condensate of @xmath30 atoms . in the linear regime",
    "the exponential gain is @xmath93 whereas the peak value of the scattered intensity is @xmath94 ^ 2 i_0 , \\label{peak}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 is the pump intensity , @xmath96 is the cross sectional area of the condensate and @xmath97 is the natural decay rate of the atomic transition .",
    "in the mit experiment , a sodium bec was exposed to a single off - resonant laser pulse red - detuned by @xmath98 ghz from the @xmath99 transition , with @xmath100 and natural width @xmath101 s@xmath102 .",
    "the recoil frequency is @xmath103 s@xmath102 .",
    "we assume that the condensate had a diameter of @xmath104 and a length of @xmath105 , approximately @xmath106 atoms participate in the emission of a scattered radiation pulse .",
    "the dimensionless parameters are @xmath107 and @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the pump intensity in mw/@xmath110 . as @xmath111 and consequently @xmath112 , the results of ref .",
    "@xcite indicate that quantum effects due to atomic diffraction should be negligibly small for this experiment , even though @xmath113 . as @xmath85 ,",
    "the atoms emit two superradiant pulses along the major axis of the condensate .",
    "the gain is approximately @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is given in ms@xmath102 , whereas the peak occurs after a time @xmath116 , in good agreement with the measured values of ref.@xcite .",
    "furthermore , from eq.([tanh ] ) the modulus of the average atomic velocity is @xmath117 .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the temporal evolution of the main peak of the scattered intensity , as given by the approximate formula ( [ sech ] ) , for the parameters of the mit experiment and three different values of the incident intensity , 3.8 mw/@xmath110 ( solid line ) , 2.4 mw/@xmath110 ( dashed line ) and 1.4 mw/@xmath110 ( dotted line ) .",
    "in addition to the temporal evolution of the scattered radiation pulses , there are other predictions of this semiclassical model which are consistent with the results of the mit experiment : firstly , superradiance is observable only if the doppler broadening of the atomic resonance is sufficiently small that @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the rms spread of the gaussian spectral distribution and @xmath120 is the superradiant time @xcite .",
    "the observed spectral width of the bragg resonance of the bec of approximately @xmath121 khz @xcite ( corresponding to a velocity spread of few mm s@xmath122 ) yields @xmath123 . we observe that , using @xmath124 , a temperature of only @xmath125 ( approximately the bec transition temperature for the mit experiment ) would increase the frequency spread by a factor of @xmath126 , enough to destroy the superradiant emission .",
    "this explains why superradiant emission was observed only at the extremely low temperatures below the threshold for bose - einstein condensation @xcite .",
    "secondly , superradiant emission parallel and antiparallel to the @xmath14 axis induces an average atomic velocity @xmath127 $ ] , respectively at 45@xmath128 degree with respect to the negative ( positive ) direction of the @xmath14 axis , as observed in the mit experiment .",
    "we assume the existence of two distinct families of atoms interacting with the two independent superradiant pulses @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "however different orders of atomic velocity , i.e. @xmath131 , with @xmath132 integers , have also been observed .",
    "more precisely , the orders @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 other than the usual @xmath138 and @xmath139 , have been clearly observed in the experiment after increasing the exposure time to the laser source and letting the atomic cloud expand ballistically after the interaction @xcite .",
    "the formation of this momentum grating can be explained as a sequential superradiant scattering process in which the atoms emit @xmath2 pulses along the positive @xmath14 and @xmath140 pulses along the negative @xmath14 axis , acquiring a total recoil velocity @xmath141 .",
    "the extremely narrow resonance line allows the atoms to emit up to three sequential superradiantly scattered pulses before @xmath142 , which is consistent with the observation of the atomic momentum distribution .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a semiclassical model describing the superradiant rayleigh scattering from a bose - einstein condensate observed in ref .",
    "the model is much simpler than those previously used to explain the results of @xcite as the atomic centre - of - mass motion is treated classically .",
    "the evolution of the scattered intensity and the atomic motion due to recoil as calculated from this simple model are in quantitative agreement with the experimental results .",
    "the fact that quantum centre - of - mass effects such as atomic diffraction are negligible is a consequence of the high density of the condensate . in our model",
    "the bec is essentially described as a collisionless doppler - free atomic gas .",
    "the results presented here suggest that together with its high density , the most important property of the condensate with regard to superradiant light scattering is its very low temperature rather than its quantum degenerate nature . in this respect",
    "the situation is similar to that of ultraslow propagation of light in a bec @xcite .",
    "subsequent observations of ultraslow propagation in a hot vapour @xcite demonstrated that the significant property of the bec was that it was a doppler - free optical medium rather than a quantum degenerate one .",
