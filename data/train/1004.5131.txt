    "<S> a new method for solving the time - dependent two - center dirac equation is developed . </S>",
    "<S> the time - dependent dirac wave function is represented as a sum of atomic - like dirac - sturm orbitals , localized at the ions . </S>",
    "<S> the atomic orbitals are obtained by solving numerically the finite - difference one - center dirac and dirac - sturm equations with the potential which is the sum of the exact reference - nucleus potential and a monopole - approximation potential from the other nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> an original procedure to calculate the two - center integrals with these orbitals is proposed . </S>",
    "<S> the approach is tested by calculations of the charge transfer and ionization cross sections for the h(1s)proton collisions at proton energies from 1 kev to 100 kev . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained results are compared with related experimental and other theoretical data . to investigate the role of the relativistic effects , the charge transfer cross sections for the ne@xmath0(@xmath1)ne@xmath2 ( at energies from @xmath3 to @xmath4 mev / u ) and u@xmath5(1s)u@xmath6 ( at energies from 6 to 10 mev / u ) collisions are calculated in both relativistic and nonrelativistic cases . </S>"
