    "the unification scheme of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) requires an anisotropic obscuring structure that surrounds the central accreting black hole ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in this picture ,",
    "the bulk of the radiation from the central engine is absorbed by the obscuring structure ( commonly referred to as the torus ) and re - emitted mainly in mid - infrared ( mir ) wavelengths .",
    "a component of very hot dust at the innermost edge of the torus has been suggested in the past ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in recent years is increasingly being supported by observations .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "other studies fitted the nir - mir spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of agns using a blackbody spectrum to represent emission from hot dust in the inner region of the torus ( e.g. , @xcite , hereafter m09 ; @xcite ) .",
    "more recently @xcite found similar results by fitting only the optical - nir sed of 23 agns .",
    "the modeled temperature of this component is found to be high , @xmath3 , regardless of the agn luminosity and consistent with pure - graphite dust composition ( m09 ) .",
    "several studies have shown that the luminosity of the nir excess emission correlates with that of the central engine ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) with a slope close to unity . however , it is yet unclear whether this hot - dust component is related to other agn properties such as its mass ( m_bh @xmath4 ) or normalized accretion rate ( l / l_edd @xmath5 ) .",
    "although hot dust seems to be a common feature of agns , several recent studies have suggested that a certain fraction of the agn population lacks such a component .",
    "@xcite found two z@xmath66 qsos without any detectable emission from hot dust ( using  mir photometry ) .",
    "these were dubbed `` hot - dust free '' qsos . @xcite and",
    "more recently @xcite found a sizable amount of type - i agns with unusually weak nir emission in several large samples of type - i agns .",
    "these were dubbed `` hot - dust - poor '' ( hdp ; hereafter we adopt this notation ) agns .",
    "these authors found that the fraction of hdp agns increases with redshift from 6% at low redshift ( @xmath7 ) to 20% at higher redshift ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "we note that all the studies mentioned here are limited to relatively small samples , and use highly simplified emission models .    in this letter",
    "we use the recently published preliminary data release of the wide infrared survey explorer ( wise ; * ? ? ?",

    ", the emission from the `` standard '' torus becomes significant ( see fig .  4 in m09 ) .",
    "thus , we select from the sdss only high confidence `` qso '' sources ( i.e. ` zconf`@xmath13 ) at @xmath1 .",
    "this query returned 20231 sources within the area covered in the wise preliminary dr .",
    "cross - matching this sample with the wise catalog , using a 3  search radius , yielded 19116 matched sources .",
    "the remaining 1115 sources ( @xmath14 ) probably lie below the flux limit defined for the wise preliminary dr , of @xmath15 in the 3.4  band .",
    "these sources have a similar range of l_bol @xmath10  to that of the whole parent sample , and are further discussed in  [ sec_results ] .",
    "thus , our analysis of the wise data provides useful information regarding @xmath16 of optically selected , @xmath1 , type - i agn ( see more criteria below ) .",
    "we further filtered the resultant cross - matched catalog to include only the 17920 sources which have @xmath17 in each of the @xmath03.4 , 4.6 & 11.6  wise bands .",
    "our analysis ignores the @xmath12  band .",
    "the wise cataloged magnitudes and associated uncertainties were translated to @xmath18 through the published ( `` iso '' ) wise zero points .",
    "the sdss spectra of all these qsos were modeled by a comprehensive procedure that is aimed at fitting the broad ii2798 mgii@xmath19  emission line and the adjacent emission complexes .",
    "the procedure is identical to that used in @xcite , and similar to other studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most importantly , it allows a robust determination of fwhm ( ) and of the monochromatic luminosity at ( rest - frame ) 3000  ( @xmath20@xmath21 $ ] , hereafter @xmath22 ) .",
    "further 1571 sources , for which the  fitting procedure failed to provide high - confidence results , were excluded .",
    "we also excluded 421 sources with @xmath23 , which might contain some host - galaxy contribution to their rest - frame nir sed , and often have sdss spectra with low s / n . finally , our sample consists of 15928 qsos with @xmath24 , which correspond to about 78% of all sdss selected @xmath1 , type - i agn covered by wise observations . from these measurements ,",

    "these values are lower , by a factor of @xmath26 , than those of @xcite or @xcite , since they avoid the double - counting of the re - processed ir emission ( see the detailed discussion in * ? ? ?",

    "we estimated the accretion rate as @xmath29 .",
    "the sdss / wise sed of each source in our sample is fitted to constrain the properties of the hot - dust component that dominates the nir wavelength range . to focus on continuum emission ,",
    "every sdss spectrum was sampled at several continuum bands , around the ( rest frame ) wavelengths : @xmath30   ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our models include two different components : a source of uv - optical continuum emission ( e.g. , an accretion disk ) and very hot - dust clouds with pure graphite composition .    to model the central - source continuum emission we assume a power - law function , @xmath31 .",
    "this component has two free parameters , the power - law index and the normalization factor .",
    "the power - law index , @xmath32 , is changed in steps of 0.1 between -1.5 to 1 .",
    "the second component represents a collection of dusty clouds of gas with a pure - graphite grain composition .",
    "the sed of this component is taken from the models of @xcite , which provide a full discussion of all model assumptions and parameters . in short",
    ", this study adopts the `` cloud model '' of the broad - line region ( blr ) and considers the graphite - containing gas to be the extension of the blr .",
    "the model assumes gas composition of 2 , standard ism - type dust depletion , gas density in the range @xmath33 and column density in the range @xmath34 at the graphite sublimation radius . while the local emission of the graphite dust depends only on the grain properties , the dust temperature inside the cloud varies by a large factor because of the local grain opacity .",
    "thus a single cloud spectrum appears as a combination of many modified blackbodies .",
    "the results of the calculations provide a grid of seds that are used in the fitting procedure . for this component",
    "there are two free fitting parameters , the distance to the cloud ( given a source luminosity ) and a normalization factor which determines its luminosity ( hereafter l_hd @xmath35 ) .",
    "for example , the range of distances for an agn with @xmath36 is 1.3 to 3.5 pc .",
    "the fitting procedure uses a standard  minimization to determine the best fit combination of power - law and hot - dust model .",
    "figure  [ fig : fit_example ] demonstrates the fitting procedure for a representative case .",
    "the hot pure - graphite dust component dominates the sed between @xmath02 and 5 .",
    "the main caveat of the fitting procedure is the ( unknown ) contribution to the sed from cooler dust in the torus . as shown in @xcite , neglecting this component may lead to an overestimation of l_hd @xmath35  by merely @xmath37% . in the following analysis , we do not correct for this systematic uncertainty .    ) using a combination of power - law ( red line ) and hot , pure - graphite dust ( blue line ) components .",
    "the original sdss spectrum is shown in gray and the continuum bands selected for the fitting procedure are highlighted in black .",
    "the best fit model is shown in red .",
    "the quality of the fit is demonstrated by the ratio between the data and the model ( bottom).,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the chosen redshift range , and thus typical agn luminosities , securely omits any host galaxy dominated seds from our sample . to minimize the effect of the ( unknown ) host - related extinction , we further limit our sample to include only sources for which the best - fit slope of the power - law component satisfies @xmath38 .",
    "this choice is comparable to those made in other studies of the optical to nir sed of agns .",
    "for example , the @xcite composite has @xmath39 over the relevant wavelength range , while @xcite show that @xmath32 ranges between about -0.8 and 0.6 , based on the @xcite seds . in any case",

    "figure  [ fig : lhd_lbol ] shows a prominent correlation between l_hd @xmath35  and l_bol @xmath10 .",
    "we also highlight a sub - sample of sources with extremely blue continua , which are defined as those with @xmath42 , and correspond to the bluest third of the sample ( following * ? ? ?",
    "these sources are presumably less affected by extinction .",
    "the distribution of these blue sources in the @xmath43 plane is similar to that of the entire sample , suggesting that host extinction plays only a minor role in our analysis .",
    "results for the quest sample ( pg qsos studied in m09 ; red squares in fig .  [",
    "fig : lhd_lbol ] ) were calculated by employing the m09 procedure ( using the pure - graphite models ) to the @xmath02 to 35  seds .",
    "assuming that the rest - frame nir sed is due to reprocessed agn radiation by the hot - dust clouds , we can deduce the covering factor ( _ hd @xmath41 ) of the central source by these clouds , defined by @xmath44 ( * ? ? ?",
    "[ fig : lhd_lbol ] clearly indicates that _ hd @xmath41  of the entire population spans a relatively limited range .",
    "indeed , the distribution of _ hd @xmath41  ( figure  [ fig : hist_cf ] ) appears to be fairly concentrated around a peak value of 0.13 ( median value is 0.1 with a standard deviation of 0.4 dex ) . this value is smaller than the one found for the lower luminosity , lower redshift , quest sample ( @xmath00.23 ) .",

    "[ fig : cf_lbol ] presents a clear anti - correlation between _",
    "hd @xmath41  and l_bol @xmath10 .",
    "this trend is further confirmed by both pearson s and spearman s rank correlation tests ( p value @xmath48 for both tests ) .",
    "in particular , the typical _",
    "hd @xmath41  decreases from @xmath49 for sources with @xmath50 to @xmath51 for sources with @xmath52 .",
    "we verified that a similar relation is recovered even if one calculates l_bol",

    "several earlier studies suggested a similar trend ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however these were based on the total mir emission which translates to the covering factor of the entire dusty structure , and not just the hot dust .",
    "@xcite suggest that this @xmath53 anti - correlation may be a manifestation of dust extinction .",
    "we therefore verified that this trend persists for the sub - sample of blue sources , defined above .",
    "we further checked whether the _",
    "hd @xmath41-l_bol @xmath10  relation is due to the higher abundance of more luminous agns towards higher redshifts , using a sub - sample of 3837 sources which reside in a narrow luminosity range ( 0.2 dex ) around @xmath54 .",
    "although this sub - sample spans almost the entire redshift range of the original sample , no correlation is found between _",
    "hd @xmath41  and redshift .",
    "the physical mechanism responsible for the decrease of covering factor with l_bol @xmath10  is still undetermined .",
    "one possibility is a `` receding torus '' scenario @xcite , where higher luminosity implies larger dust sublimation distance , and hence an obscuring structure that is located farther away from the center . in this scenario ,",
    "however , the geometry of the hot - dust clouds must be toroidal and have a constant height .",
    "another possibility is that the _ hd @xmath41-l_bol @xmath10  anti - correlation is analogous to the anti - correlation found between the equivalent width of different blr lines (  and ) and agn luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the correlations between _",
    "hd @xmath41  and m_bh @xmath4  and l / l_edd @xmath5  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cf_lbol ] , middle and right panels ) are much less significant .",
    "we interpret these as the result of the marginal dependence of both m_bh",
    "@xmath4  and l / l_edd @xmath5  on the source luminosity .",
    "this is further confirmed by the fact that these marginal correlations disappear completely in the @xmath54 sub - sample mentioned above .",
    "however , the large scatter makes it difficult to securely determine which correlation is more fundamental .",
    "we suggest that the apparent _ hd @xmath41  is sensitive to the immediate irradiating flux from the central source , but does not depend on the evolutionary stage of the accreting super - massive black hole ( smbh ) .    for a certain fraction of the sources , the hot - dust",
    "a component is much less prominent .",
    "first , as noted above , @xmath45 of the sources have @xmath46 and thus @xmath47 .",
    "these sources spread the entire range of l_bol @xmath10 .",
    "second , there is a non negligible population of sources with significantly lower _",
    "hd @xmath41  values than the main locus of sources ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cf_lbol ] ) .",
    "there is no corresponding population of high-_hd @xmath41  outliers .",
    "[ fig : cf_lbol ] illustrates this using the boundaries of the 99th percentiles of the _ hd @xmath41  distribution .",
    "the percentiles are calculated by assuming that the _",
    "hd @xmath41  distribution should be symmetrical around the peak and mirroring the high-_hd @xmath41  side of the distribution .",
    "this is done in each ( 0.2 dex ) luminosity bin separately .",
    "we suggest that all the points which lie below the lower dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : cf_lbol ] can be regarded as hdp agns .",
    "thus , we are able to provide an hdp criterion which depends on l_bol @xmath10 . for example , for @xmath55 all sources with @xmath56 may be considered as hdp agns .",
    "the total fraction of hdp agns in our sample is @xmath57 ( 2439 sources out of 15077 , including the 258 sources with @xmath47 ) .",
    "this number is in rough agreement with that reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we do not find a significant dependence of this fraction with either luminosity or redshift .",
    "we stress that using a hdp criterion that is independent of agn luminosity can result in false correlations of the fraction of hdp agns with either luminosity or redshift .",
    "the latter may be a consequence of selection biases of high luminosity sources towards higher redshifts . as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec_sample ] , 1115 sources ( @xmath14 of the total sdss detections ) probably lie below the flux limit defined for the preliminary dr of wise .",
    "these sources may also represent hdp agns , thus should be added to the total fraction mentioned above ( @xmath57 ) .    as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec_intro ] , @xcite suggested that a significant fraction of @xmath58 agns are hot - dust free , i.e. lacking any emission from a hot , dusty component .",
    "moreover , these authors claim that such systems are not observed at lower redshifts .",
    "taken at face value , our @xmath47 sources can be regarded as the @xmath7 counterparts of the @xmath58 hot - dust free agns .",
    "these are indeed rare at low redshifts .",
    "however , the hot - dust free agns of @xcite have only upper limits in the ( rest - frame ) ir bands , which place them in our hdp agn regime ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cf_lbol ] ) .",
    "thus , our sample might offer many more @xmath7 sources that correspond to the hot - dust free notion of @xcite , from both the wise - undetected sub - sample ( @xmath14 ) and the hdp agn sub - sample ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "we also note that variability between the sdss and wise observational epochs would not effect the estimation of the fraction of hdp agns for large samples .",
    "it may , however , account for some of the scatter observed in the symmetric part of the _ hd @xmath41  distribution .",
    "we have demonstrated that the rest - frame nir emission of the vast majority ( @xmath59% ) of type - i agns in our unprecedentedly large sample can be explained by emission from hot , pure - graphite dust clouds .",
    "these clouds reside at distances greater by a factor of about @xmath60 than the blr clouds , and have a typical _ hd @xmath41  of @xmath61 . the lack of a significant correlation between _",
    "@xmath41  and m_bh @xmath4   stands in contrast to the result of @xcite , who suggested that such a relation only exists at very high redshifts ( @xmath58 ) , where dusty structures around agns were not yet fully developed .",
    "interestingly , we do not find any significant correlation between _",
    "hd @xmath41  and either l / l_edd @xmath5  or redshift , despite the fact that our sample effectively covers a wide range in these properties ( @xmath62 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "we suggest that previous reports of a decrease in _",
    "hd @xmath41 , and an increase in the fraction of hdp agns , with increasing redshift , may be due to a combination of the selection of high - luminosity sources at high redshifts and the _ hd @xmath41-l_bol @xmath10  anti - correlation reported here .",
    "however , the small overlap in l_bol @xmath10  between the low - z quest sample and the sdss / wise sample , and the limited range of l_bol @xmath10  for sdss / wise sources , at a chosen redshift , inhibits us from testing this issue further . to fully understand the _ evolution _ of hot dusty structures around accreting smbhs",
    ", all these trends should be tested in large samples of high redshift type - i quasars , for which l_bol @xmath10 , m_bh @xmath4  and l / l_edd",
