    "the use of the effective lagrangian does not necessarily stem from our ignorance of the full dynamics .",

    "@xcite , the effective field theory framework is not only simpler and more transparent , but it actually provides a deeper insight into the relevant physics .",
    "commonly , the effective field theory approach is applied for estimating the size of higher order corrections @xcite-@xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider an effective field theory approach to electroweak radiative corrections and show how it can conveniently relate various radiative corrections important for testing the standard model ( sm ) in a rather elegant and clear way .",
    "more importantly , this approach is shown to clearly identify observables which are sensitive to the symmetry - breaking sector of the electroweak theories .",
    "the strong evidence @xcite-@xcite for the presence of a heavy top quark motivates many studies on various scenarios in which new physics shows up in the top quark sector .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite , we studied the general ( nonstandard ) couplings of the top quark to the electroweak ( ew ) gauge bosons in an effective chiral lagrangian formulated electroweak theory with the spontaneously broken symmetry @xmath1 .",
    "the question regarding the origin of such nonstandard interactions is of a great importance , and was discussed to some extent in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we shall not repeat that discussion but to recall our conclusion that the previously announced lep data @xcite constrained somewhat the left - handed neutral current interaction . on the other hand , the right - handed neutral current and the charged currents were not usefully constrained by the data .",
    "in this paper we will concentrate on two main points .",
    "the first point is to study the leading corrections of @xmath2 to low energy observables arising from some nonstandard couplings of the top quark to the ew gauge bosons , parameterized in the chiral lagrangian .",
    "is the cutoff scale at which the effective lagrangian is valid . ]",
    "an earlier study was done in ref .",
    "@xcite by considering a gauge invariant set of feynman diagrams in which massive gauge bosons appeared as external or internal lines .",
    "the goldstone bosons and top quark only appeared as internal lines .",
    "because the leading radiative corrections ( in powers of @xmath3 ) are closely related to the spontaneous symmetry - breaking ( ssb ) sector , we expect that such corrections can be derived entirely from considering the interactions between the top quark and the scalar bosons ( e.g. , goldstone bosons and possibly the higgs boson ) . in this paper",
    "we develop a different formalism to calculate these leading corrections , using only the pure scalar boson and the top - bottom fermionic sectors in the chiral lagrangian .",
    "we show how to reproduce the results obtained in ref .",

    "the second point is to update the constraints on the nonstandard couplings of the top quark to the ew gauge bosons using the new lep @xcite and slc data @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",

    "3 we update the constraints on the nonstandard couplings of the top quark to the ew gauge bosons .",
    "( previous constraints were given in ref .",

    "the relation between the linear and the nonlinear realization of @xmath6 corresponds to some fixed nonlinear gauge transformation @xcite .",
    "the chiral lagrangian approach has been used in understanding the low energy strong interactions because it can systematically describe the phenomena of spontaneous symmetry - breaking @xcite .",
    "recently , the same technique has been widely used in studying the electroweak sector @xcite to which this work has been directed .",
    "a chiral lagrangian can be constructed solely based upon the broken symmetry of the theory , and it is not necessary to specify the detailed dynamics of the actual breaking mechanism .",
    "hence , it is the most general effective lagrangian that can accommodate any underlying theory with that pattern of symmetry - breaking at the low energy scale .",
    "furthermore , to study the low energy behavior of such a theory using the chiral lagrangian approach , an expansion in powers of the external momentum is usually performed @xcite . in this approach",

    "there are three goldstone bosons , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , generated by this breakdown , which are eventually eaten by @xmath13 and @xmath14 gauge bosons and become their longitudinal degrees of freedom .",

    "( [ eq4 ] ) can be expanded as @xmath73 at the tree - level , the mass of @xmath32 boson is @xmath74 and the mass of @xmath14 boson is @xmath75 .",
    "the above identity implies that the radiative corrections to the mass of the gauge bosons can be related to the wavefunction renormalization of the goldstone bosons , cf .",
    "( [ wzmass ] ) , and therefore sensitive to the symmetry - breaking sector .",
    "fermions can be included in this context by assuming that each flavor transforms under @xmath76 as @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the electric charge of @xmath79 .    out of the fermion fields",

    "our goal is to study the large yukawa corrections to the low energy data from the chiral lagrangian formulated electroweak theories .",

    "@xcite , where the gauge bosons were considered as classical fields so that the full gauge invariance of the sm lagrangian was maintained , and a set of ward identities was derived to relate the green s functions of the goldstone bosons and the gauge bosons . hence",
    ", large @xmath91 corrections can be easily obtained from calculating feynman diagrams involving only fermions ( top and bottom quarks ) and scalar bosons ( e.g. , goldstone bosons and possibly the higgs boson ) but not gauge bosons .",
    "the same conclusion can be drawn using the chiral lagrangian approach in a far more elegant and clear way , as shown below in this section .",
    "why is the chiral lagrangian formulation useful in finding large @xmath91 corrections beyond the tree - level ?",

    "thus , there is no need to fix a gauge and the full gauge invariance of the effective lagrangian is maintained . because the chiral lagrangian possesses the @xmath65 invariance ( nonlinearly ) and the @xmath22 invariance ( linearly ) at any given order of the perturbative expansions , and all the loop corrections can be reorganized using the composite fields @xmath94 , and @xmath47 in a gauge invariant form , therefore , it is the most convenient and elegant way to find @xmath91 corrections beyond the tree - level .",
    "this is obvious because the leading radiative corrections ( in powers of @xmath3 ) are products of the ssb and therefore independent of the weak gauge coupling @xmath0 .",
    "we note that in the expansion of the field @xmath95 there is always a factor @xmath0 associated with a weak gauge boson field .",
    "hence , loop corrections independent of the gauge coupling @xmath0 can be obtained by simply considering the scalar and the fermionic sectors in the theory . in the following",
    "we shall show how this is done .      to obtain the large contributions of the top quark mass ( in powers of @xmath3 ) to low energy data ,",
    "we need only to concentrate on the top - bottom fermionic sector ( @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) in addition to the bosonic sector .",
    "the most general gauge invariant chiral lagrangian can be written as @xmath98 where @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 parameterize possible deviations from the sm predictions  @xcite , and @xmath103 indicates possible higgs boson interactions and other higher dimensional operators .",
    "here we have assumed that new physics from the ssb sector might modify the interactions of the top quark to the ew gauge bosons . on the other hand ,",

    "one can also enlarge the set of observables used in the analysis by including all the lep data and the slc measurement of the left - right cross section asymmetry @xmath253 in @xmath14 production with a longitudinally polarized electron beam , where @xcite @xmath254 for @xmath255    following the same analyses carried out in ref .",

    "@xmath264 @xmath265 from a global fit @xcite using all the new lep and slc data .",
    "for reference , we list here some of the relevant data , taken from @xcite , @xmath266    we find that within @xmath267 the allowed region of these three parameters exhibits the same features as that obtained using the old set of data ( see ref .",
    "these features can be deduced from the two - dimensional projections of the allowed parameter space , as shown in figs .  2 , 3 , and 4 .",
    "they are briefly summarized as follows :    * as a function of the top quark mass , the allowed parameter space shrinks as the top quark mass increases .",
    "* data do not exclude possible new physics coming through the top quark couplings to the ew gauge bosons .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "2 , @xmath101 and @xmath100 are not yet constrained by the current data .",
    "furthermore , no conclusion can be drawn about @xmath102 because @xmath102 does not contribute to the lep or the slc observables in the limit of taking @xmath268 .",
    "* @xmath99 is almost constrained .",
    "new physics prefers positive @xmath99 , see figs .  3 and 4 .",
    "for example , @xmath99 is constrained within ( @xmath269 to 0.5 ) for a 175 gev top quark . *",
    "new physics prefers @xmath270 .",
    "this is clearly shown in fig .  2 .",
    "as compared with the old set of data from lep and slc , new data tighten the allowed region of the nonstandard parameters @xmath240 s by no more than a factor of two .",
    "this difference is due to the slightly smaller errors on the new measurements as compared with the old ones .",
    "the largest impact of these new data on our results comes from the more precise measurement of @xmath190 which turns out to be about @xmath267 higher than the sm prediction and implies a lighter top quark . for a much heavier top quark ,",
    "new physics must come in because all the @xmath240 s can not simultaneously vanish .",
    "if the large discrepancy between lep and slc data persists , then our model of having nonstandard top quark couplings to the gauge bosons is one of the candidates that can accommodate such a difference .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to the minimum set of observables , which give @xcite @xmath271 @xmath272 we reach almost the same conclusion .",
    "the main difference is that @xmath99 shifts slightly to the right , due to the fact that the central value of @xmath5 in this case is larger than its global fit value .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we discussed an effective model incorporated with an additional approximate custodial symmetry ( responsible for @xmath273 at the tree - level ) , and concluded that @xmath274 as long as the tree - level vertex is not modified . from eq .",
    "( [ rhotau ] ) , we find for this model @xmath275 and @xmath276 using this effective model , we span the plane defined by @xmath99 and @xmath100 for top quark mass 150gev and 175gev , respectively . figs .",
    "5 and 6 show the allowed range for those parameters within @xmath267 . as a general feature one observes that the allowed range forms a narrow area aligned close to the line @xmath277 . for @xmath278gev ( 175 gev )",
    "we see that @xmath279 ( @xmath280 ) .",
    "as the top quark mass increases this range shrinks and moves downward to the right , away from the origin @xmath281 , although positive @xmath240 s remain preferred .",
    "the reason for this behavior is simply due to the fact that as @xmath3 increases , the sm value for @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) increases in the positive ( negative ) direction . to summarize this behaviour , we show , respectively , in figs .  7 and 8 the allowed ranges for @xmath101 and @xmath282 as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "an interesting point to mention is that in the global fit analysis the sm ceases to be a solution for @xmath283gev .",
    "however , with new physics effects , e.g. , @xmath284 , @xmath3 can be as large as 300 gev .",
    "in this analysis we concentrated on physics at the @xmath14 resonance , i.e. , at lep and slc .",
    "other low energy observables may as well be used to constrain the nonstandard couplings of the top quark to the gauge bosons . in ref .",
    "@xcite a constraint on the right - handed charged current , @xmath102 , was set using the cleo measurement of @xmath285 .",
    "the authors concluded that @xmath102 is well constrained to within a few percent from its sm value ( @xmath286 ) .",
    "this provides a complementary information to our result because lep and slc data are not sensitive to @xmath102 as compared to @xmath101 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 .",
    "because the top quark is heavy ( close to the symmetry - breaking scale ) it will be more sensitive than the other light fermions to new physics from the ssb sector . concentrating on effects , to low energy data , directly related to the ssb sector",
    ", we took the chiral lagrangian approach to examine whether the nonstandard couplings , @xmath240 s , of the top quark to the gauge bosons ( @xmath32 and @xmath14 ) were already strongly constrained by the old ( 1993 ) data from lep and slc  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , we found that to the order of @xmath287 only the left - handed neutral current , @xmath99 , was somewhat constrained by the precision low energy data , although data did impose some correlations among @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 .",
    "since @xmath102 does not contribute to the lep or the slc observables in the limit @xmath268 , @xmath102 can not be constrained by these data .",
    "however , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath102 was already constrained by the complementary process @xmath288 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we obtained our results by considering a set of feynman diagrams , derived form the nonlinear chiral lagrangian , whose external lines were the massive gauge boson lines . the leading corrections ( in power of @xmath3 ) to the low energy observables",
    "were found not to vanish in the limit of vanishing @xmath0 ( the weak coupling ) because they originate from strong couplings to the ssb sector , e.g. , through large yukawa coupling @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , our previous results should in principle be reproduced by considering an effective lagrangian which involves only the scalar ( the unphysical goldstone bosons and probably the higgs boson ) and the top - bottom fermionic sectors .",
    "this was shown in sec .",
    "we discussed how to relate the two corresponding sets of green s functions for the low energy observables of interest .",
    "we showed that by considering a completely different set of green s functions ( without involving any external gauge boson line ) from that discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite we obtained exactly the same results .",
    "our result for @xmath5 is different from that given in ref .",
    "@xcite where the wavefunction correction to the bottom quark was not included .    in sec .",
    "3 we used the new ( 1994 ) lep and slc data to constrain the nonstandard interactions of the top quark to the ew gauge bosons . as compared with the old ( 1993 ) data from lep and slc , the new data tighten the allowed region of the nonstandard parameters , @xmath240 s , by no more than a factor of two .",
    "this difference is mainly due to the more precise measurement of @xmath190 which turns out to be about @xmath267 higher than the sm prediction and favors a lighter top quark .",
    "if the large discrepancy between lep and slc data persists , then our model of having nonstandard top quark couplings to the gauge bosons is one of the candidates that can accommodate such a difference .",
    "positive values for @xmath240 s are preferred for the special model discussed in ref .",
