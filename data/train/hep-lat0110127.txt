    "the spectral function @xmath3 of hadrons includes information such as masses and decay constants for various bound states and the continuum spectrum for multi - particle states .",
    "recently the maximum entropy method  @xcite ( mem ) has been employed in order to extract the spectral function from lattice qcd data  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we apply the mem to the quenched lattice qcd data for pseudoscalar(ps ) and vector(v ) mesons previously calculated at @xmath4 5.90 , 6.10 , 6.25 , and 6.47  @xcite .",
    "we present the corresponding spectral functions for the case of a point source , and check the reliability of the mem by comparing the masses and decay constants from the spectral function with those from the exponential fit .",
    "we then extract the masses and decay constants for the first excited state in the continuum limit . for details",
    "we refer to ref .  @xcite .",
    "in the mem the spectral function is determined by maximizing the quantity p[@xmath5 , which is the conditional probability of the spectral function @xmath6 for a given data @xmath7 and all prior knowledge @xmath8 such as @xmath9 . by bayes",
    "s theorem this probability is replaced with @xmath10{\\mathrm p}[f|h],$ ] where p[@xmath11 is proportional to exp@xmath12 with @xmath13 the standard chi - squared , and p[@xmath14 to exp@xmath15 with @xmath16 a real positive parameter . here",
    "the entropy @xmath17",
    "@xcite is defined by @xmath3 and a positive function called model . combining these two factors",
    ", we can determine the most probable spectral function as the solution of the equation @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",
    "finally the result is averaged over @xmath16 with a weight factor p[@xmath20 .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : spec ] a typical result for the spectral functions of @xmath21 meson is presented at @xmath4 5.90 and 6.47 for three different values of @xmath22 .",
    "the parameters of the mem analysis are compiled in ref .",
    "@xcite . at each @xmath23 one observes , as expected , that the peaks move to smaller @xmath24 as quark mass decreases .",
    "as @xmath23 increases , the peaks of the ground and the first excited state also move to smaller @xmath24 as expected .",
    "in addition the number of peaks increases , since higher excited states appear below the cutoff @xmath25 at larger @xmath23 .",
    "while the peak of the ground state is very narrow , the peaks for the higher states have larger widths , the reason for which is not understood at present .",
    "the mass of a state is determined from the position of the peak in the spectral function . to check the reliability of this analysis ,",
    "the masses of the ground and the first excited state obtained in this way are compared with those from the double exponential fit of propagators for the point and smeared sources . at @xmath26 for @xmath21 meson , the two results for the ground state agree , and those for the first excited state are consistent within errors , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] .",
    "the first excited state masses for pseudoscalar and vector mesons in the chiral limit at each @xmath23 are extrapolated to the continuum limit in fig .",
    "[ fig : masscon ] . the error for the vector meson at @xmath27 is smaller than that obtained by the exponential fit(open square ) , and our result is consistent with that of ref .",
    "@xcite(open triangle ) . in the continuum limit",
    "we obtain @xmath0 mev and @xmath1 mev , which are consistent with the experimental values , though the errors are large .",
    "= 6.4 cm    = 6.2 cm      the decay constant is related to the area of the peak in the spectral function  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath28 for pseudoscalar meson and @xmath29 for vector meson .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dec0 ] , the ground state decay constants for both mesons in the chiral limit are consistent with the results obtained by the exponential fit at each @xmath23 and in the continuum limit .",
    "the decay constants are determined also for the first excited state . for the excited @xmath30 meson the decay",
    "constant vanishes in the chiral limit , since @xmath31 by definition . on the other hand , in fig .",
    "[ fig : decr1 ] , the decay constant for @xmath21 meson is finite in this limit , and we obtain @xmath2 in the continuum limit .",
    "= 6.2 cm    = 6.3 cm      we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] that there is a peak at @xmath32 almost independent of @xmath23 .",
    "a similar peak is also present in the pseudoscalar channel .",
    "apparently the masses of these states in physical units diverge in the continuum limit , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : unmass ] . here",
    "we interpret these states as bound states of two fermion doublers  @xcite : in free theory the mass of a two doublers system , each with a spatial momentum @xmath33 , is @xmath34 , which is interestingly close to @xmath32 .",
    "the difference may be ascribed to its binding energy .",
    "we note that the bound state of a physical quark and a doubler can not appear at zero spatial momentum .",
    "we have applied the maximum entropy method to our precision quenched lattice qcd data  @xcite to extract the spectral functions for pseudoscalar and vector mesons .",
    "the masses and the decay constants extracted from the spectral functions for the ground state are consistent with the ones determined by the exponential fit , while those for the first excited state are new . in future",
    "it will be interesting to apply the mem analysis to full qcd , qcd at finite temperature and a study of decay and scattering ."
