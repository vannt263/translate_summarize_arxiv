    "simulation studies of the structure and dynamic properties of complex liquids are often complicated by the fact that typical energy scales are on the order of the thermal energy and the characteristic structural length scales are in the range of nanometers to micrometers . the resulting large number of degrees of freedom and disparate length and time scales require the use of `` mesoscale '' simulation techniques which achieve high computational efficiency by `` averaging out '' irrelevant microscopic details while retaining the essential features of the microscopic physics on the length scales of interest .",
    "the fact that the properties of these systems are strongly influenced by a delicate interplay between thermal fluctuations , hydrodynamic interactions , and possible spatio - temporally varying forces , places additional stringent requirements on the simulation protocol .",
    "a recently introduced particle - based simulation technique @xcite  often called stochastic rotation dynamics ( srd ) @xcite , multi - particle collision dynamics @xcite , or real - coded lattice gas  @xcite  is a promising algorithm for mesoscale simulations of this type . srd solves the hydrodynamic equations of motion by following the path of fluid point - particles in discrete time and continuous space .",

    "the fluid is therefore very compressible , and the speed of sound , @xmath8 , is low .",
    "however , this collision rule is not unique and other choices of collision rules can lead to nonideal behavior . in this paper",
    "we consider one such collision rule and discuss in detail the conditions which must be fulfilled in order to guarantee thermodynamic consistency .",
    "there are , however , several subtleties associated with collision rules of this type , such as phase space contraction and semi - detailed balance in this reduced phase space , which are not addressed here . in systems with explicit interparticle potentials  such as the hard sphere fluid  this behavior can be analyzed in considerable detail .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , there are no non - trivial models with multi - particle interactions of the type we consider for which this has been done .",
    "the thermodynamic consistency of such models is not ensured a priori , and the aim of this paper is to provide guidelines for the construction of consistent models and to point out possible pitfalls .",
    "a more realistic modeling of dense gases and liquids can be achieved by introducing generalized excluded volume interactions between the fluid particles .",
    "the resulting algorithm can be thought of as a coarse - grained multi - particle collision generalization of a hard sphere fluid , since , just as for hard spheres , the kinetic energy is conserved .",
    "there is no potential energy , so that the internal energy is the same as that of an ideal gas .",
    "thermodynamic consistency therefore requires that @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the spatial dimension .",

    "the coordinates , @xmath22 , of the solvent particles at time @xmath23 are updated according to @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the velocity of particle @xmath26 at time @xmath23 and @xmath0 is the value of the discretized time step . in order to define the collision , we introduce a second grid with sides of length @xmath27 which ( in @xmath28 ) groups four adjacent cells into one `` supercell '' . for simplicity , we restricted ourselves to two dimensions , but the algorithm can be easily extended to three dimensions .    as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a random shift of the particle coordinates before the collision step is required to ensure galilean invariance .",
    "all particles are therefore shifted by the _",
    "same _ random vector with components in the interval @xmath29 $ ] before the collision step .",
    "particles are then shifted back by the same amount after the collision . to initiate a collision , pairs of cells in every supercell",
    "are randomly selected . as shown in fig . 1 , three distinct choices are possible : a ) horizontal ( @xmath30 ) , b ) vertical ( @xmath31 ) , and c ) diagonal collisions ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) .",
    "in every cell , we define the mean particle velocity , @xmath34 , where the sum runs over all particles , @xmath35 , in the cell with index @xmath36 .",
    "the projection of the difference of the mean velocities of the selected cell - pairs on @xmath37 , @xmath38 , is then used to determine the probability of a collision . if @xmath39 , no collision will be performed . for positive @xmath40",
    ", a collision will occur with an acceptance probability which depends , in principle , on @xmath40 and the number of particles in the two cells , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "indeed , the choice of acceptance probability , @xmath43 , determines both the equation of state and values of the transport coefficients , and the requirement of thermodynamic consistency imposes severe restrictions on the choice of @xmath43 . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the choice @xmath44 , with @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the unit step function and a is a ( small ) constant leads to an equation of state of the required form . in this paper",

    "@xcite .",
    "the collisions should conserve the total momentum and kinetic energy of the cell - pairs participating in the collision , and in analogy to the hard - sphere liquid , they should primarily transfer the component of the momentum which is parallel to the connecting vector @xmath49 .",
