    "radon - type transforms that assign to a given function its integrals over various sets of ellipses / ellipsoids arise in migration imaging under an assumption that the medium is acoustic and homogeneous .",
    "the aim of migration is to construct an image of the inside of the earth from seismic reflections recorded at its surface  @xcite .",
    "a graphical approach called classical migration was developed systematically by hagedoorn @xcite .",
    "classical migration had been abandoned after the wave - equation method was introduced by claerbout  @xcite in 1971 .",
    "gazdag and sguazzero pointed out that the classical migration procedures that existed at that time were not based on a completely sound theory  @xcite .",
    "however , a correct construction for the wave - equation method was often difficult to find because the experiment data did not fit into a single wave equation .",
    "to adapt the diffraction stack to borehole seismic experiments , a new approach to seismic migration was found .",
    "this approach gave classical migration a sound theory .",
    "after that discovery , classical migration has attracted many researchers in the field .",
    "the underlying idea is that seismic data in the far field can be regarded as if the data are coming from integrals of the earth s acoustic scattering potential over surfaces determined by the velocity model  @xcite .",
    "these radon - type transforms relate to migration imaging as well as bistatic synthetic aperture radar ( bisar ) @xcite , ultrasound reflection tomography ( urt ) @xcite , and radio tomography @xcite .    because of these applications",
    ", there have been several papers devoted to the topic of elliptical radon transforms .",
    "the family of ellipses with one focus fixed at the origin and the other one moving along a given line was considered in  @xcite . in the same paper ,",
    "the family of ellipses with a fixed focal distance was also studied .",
    "the authors of  @xcite dealt with the case of circular acquisition , when the two foci of ellipses with a given focal distance are located on a given circle .",
    "a family of ellipses with two moving foci was also handled in  @xcite .",
    "radio tomography , which uses a wireless network of radio transmitters and receivers to image the distribution of attenuation within the network , was discussed in  @xcite .",
    "they approximated the obtained signal by the volume integral of the attenuation over this ellipsoid .",
    "one work @xcite derived two inversion formulas of this volume integral of the attenuation over this ellipsoid and studied its properties .",
    "many works found an approximate inversion for elliptical radon transforms .",
    "here we consider migration imaging and introduce a new type of an elliptical radon transform obtained by restricting the position of the source and receiver in migration imaging .",
    "we find an explicit inversion formula for this elliptical radon transform arising in migration imaging which is the line / area integral of the function over the ellipse / ellipsoid with foci restricted to a hyperplane .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the problem of interest is stated precisely and the elliptical radon transform is formulated in section  [ formulation ] . in section 3 , we show how to reduce the elliptical radon transform to the regular radon transform . the numerical simulation to demonstrate the suggested 2-dimensional algorithm is presented in section 4 .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent 3-dimensional source and receiver positions , respectively . for fixed points @xmath5 , an isochron surface",
    "@xmath6 is a surface consisting of image points @xmath7 associated by the travel time function @xmath8 , which gives the travel time @xmath9 between two points @xmath10 and @xmath11 with a known velocity @xmath12 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "mathematically , @xmath6 can be described as the set of the image points @xmath13 satisfying the constraint that the total travel time from the source @xmath14 though the image point @xmath13 to the receiver @xmath15 is constant and equal to @xmath16 .",
    "the isochron surface @xmath6 can be represented as@xmath17    seismic experiments yield data @xmath18 which are functions of the source position @xmath14 , receiver position @xmath15 , and time @xmath16 . assuming an object function @xmath19 on @xmath20 , the data @xmath21 is modelled by the integral of @xmath22 over @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath23 the two detectors have nonzero sizes and time is also passing , so it is reasonable to assume that what we measure is the `` average''-concentrated near the location of the detectors and nearly zero sufficiently far away from the detectors - over a small region of space and a small time interval preceding the time @xmath16 . in mathematical terms , our data can be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the dirac delta function .",
    "( most works  @xcite dealing with an elliptical radon transform consider the arc length measure instead . )",
    "miller , oristaglio , and beylkin suggested this model and approximately recovered the object function @xmath22 by appropriately weighted back projection of the data in @xcite .",
    "however , we present the explicit formula for reconstructing @xmath22 using the specific minimum data of @xmath21 by changing the variables of positions of the two detectors .",
    "the total dimension of the data @xmath21 is 7 . to reduce the overdeterminacy , we assume that @xmath14 and @xmath15 are located on a hyperplane , say @xmath26 and also that the difference vector @xmath27 is parallel to a given line , say the @xmath28-axis .",
    "( in 2 dimensions , the difference vector @xmath27 is automatically parallel to the @xmath28-axis because the hyperplane is the line . ) hence , for any @xmath29 , we write @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "also , assuming a velocity @xmath12 is set to a constant 1 , @xmath8 becomes the distance @xmath32 between @xmath13 and @xmath33 .",
    "since @xmath34 satisfies @xmath35 , a point @xmath34 can be described by the ellipsoid equation @xmath36 let us choose a constant @xmath37 between 0 and 1 .",
    "we consider the fixed value of @xmath38 satisfying the equation @xmath39 , which is a new additional requirement .",
    "then a point @xmath34 can be also described by the equation @xmath40 if we set @xmath41 , then our data become @xmath42 where @xmath43 . here , we restrict the positions of the source and receiver in migration imaging , say , @xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath46 . in general , reducing the space of positions for two devices is more useful and economical .",
    "if the function is odd with respect to @xmath47 , then @xmath48 is equal to zero .",
    "we thus assume the function @xmath22 to be even with respect to @xmath47 : @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "we call @xmath48 an elliptical radon transform , since this is the surface area integral of @xmath22 over the set of these ellipsoids .",
    "we generalize this @xmath51-dimension setup to @xmath52-dimension and define a more general form of an elliptical radon transform .",
    "let @xmath53 be given numbers , let @xmath54 denote the @xmath55 diagonal matrix with diagonal entries @xmath56 , and let @xmath22 be a locally integrable function on @xmath0 , even with respect to @xmath57 .",
    "the elliptical radon transforms of @xmath22 is defined by @xmath58    note that we do not need the condition @xmath59 any more . if all @xmath56 , @xmath60 , are equal to 1 , the elliptical radon transform @xmath61 becomes the spherical radon transform with the centers of the sphere of integration located on the hyperplane , a well - studied transform ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "here we assume that the object function @xmath22 does not touch the detectors ; that is , the support of @xmath22 does not intersect the hyperplane @xmath62 where the two detectors are located .    to obtain an inversion formula for the elliptical radon transform ,",
    "we manipulate @xmath61 . by changing the variables @xmath63 , we can write @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 . here",
    "@xmath67 is the area measure of the unit sphere .",
    "let @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we define a map @xmath70 by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the @xmath73 diagonal matrix .",
    "[ prop : property ]    * the map @xmath74 is a bijection with the inverse map @xmath75 defined by @xmath76 * we have @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "the map @xmath79 transforms an ellipsoid into a hyperplane. changing variables using this map @xmath80 plays a critical role in reducing the elliptical radon transform to the regular radon transform .",
    "we can easily check that @xmath81 for @xmath82 and @xmath83 for @xmath84 , so @xmath85 is a bijection .",
    "consider @xmath86 for @xmath84 with @xmath87 : @xmath88    we define the function @xmath89 on @xmath0 by @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "this is equivalent for @xmath92 , to @xmath93 where @xmath94 . by the evenness of @xmath22 ,",
    "we have @xmath95 let the regular radon transform @xmath96 be defined by @xmath97 where @xmath98 and for @xmath99^{n-2},$ ] @xmath100 this can be represented by @xmath101 for @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the following theorem shows the relation between @xmath61 and @xmath104 .",
    "[ thm : mainrelation ] let @xmath105 be even in @xmath57 and have compact support in @xmath106 .",
    "then we have @xmath107 again , @xmath78 .",
    "combining two equations ( [ eq : defiref ] ) and ( [ eq : ffromk ] ) , we have @xmath108 let us consider the variable change @xmath109 the jacobian of this transformation is @xmath110 , so @xmath111 since @xmath112 has compact support in @xmath113 , we have @xmath114 we recognize the right hand side as the integral along the hyperplane perpendicular to @xmath115 with ( signed ) distance @xmath116 from the origin . in this case",
    ", the measure for the hyperplane becomes @xmath117 setting @xmath118 in equation   we have the desired formula from equation  .    using the projection slice theorem for the regular radon transform",
    ", we obtain an analog of the projection slice theorem for the elliptical radon transform @xmath61 :    [ thm : projectionslice ] let @xmath119 be even in @xmath57 and have compact support in @xmath106 .",
    "then we have for @xmath120 , @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the @xmath52-dimensional fourier transform of @xmath112 .",
    "the projection slice theorem implies @xmath123 to use this theorem , we multiply equation   by @xmath124 and integrate @xmath125 from @xmath126 to infinity : @xmath127 since @xmath112 has compact support in @xmath128 , the plane perpendicular to @xmath129 with distance from the origin less than @xmath130 does not intersect the compact support of @xmath112 .",
    "hence , @xmath131 is equal to @xmath132 where in the second line , we used theorem  [ thm : mainrelation ] .",
    "setting @xmath133 and @xmath134 completes our proof .    taking the inverse fourier transform of a function @xmath112 and using equation ( [ eq : ffromk ] )",
    ", we have the following inversion formula :    let @xmath119 be even in @xmath57 and have compact support in @xmath106 .",
    "then @xmath19 can be reconstructed as follows : @xmath135 where @xmath136    we get for @xmath92 , @xmath137 where in the first line , we used equation ( [ eq : ffromk ] ) and in the last line , we used theorem  [ thm : projectionslice ] and @xmath138 the evenness of @xmath22 in @xmath57 gives us @xmath139 changing the variables @xmath140 , @xmath19 is equal to @xmath141 by definition of @xmath142 , @xmath19 can be determined through @xmath143    when @xmath1 , equation becomes @xmath144 since in the distribution sense , @xmath145",
    "here we discuss the results of 2-dimensional numerical implementations . in 2-dimension , equation   becomes @xmath146 setting @xmath147 and @xmath148 in equation  ( [ eq : refrk2 ] ) , we have @xmath149 where @xmath150 ( while @xmath151 is used in theorem  [ thm : mainrelation ] , @xmath152 is used to utilize the built - in function in matlab . hence a small change is required . ) again , since @xmath112 has compact support in @xmath153 , the plane perpendicular to @xmath154 with distance from the origin less than @xmath155 does not intersect the compact support of @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath156 first of all , @xmath157 and @xmath158 were set to be 0.8 and 1 , respectively . in the experiments presented here",
    "we use the phantom shown in figure  [ fig : spherical ] ( a ) .",
    "the phantom , supported within the rectangle @xmath159\\times[-1,1]$ ] , is the sum of eight characteristic functions of disks .",
    "notice that it has to be even with respect to the @xmath160-axis and there are four characteristic functions of disks centered at @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , and @xmath164 with radii 0.2 0.15 0.05 and 0.05 , whose values are 1 , 0.5 , 1.5 , and 2 above the @xmath28-axis .",
    "hence we also include their reflection below the @xmath28-axis .",
    "( actually , our phantom has support in @xmath165 this implies that @xmath112 has support in the unit ball and this makes it sufficient to consider the range @xmath159 $ ] in @xmath166 . )",
