    "in order to clarify the nature of the gapped phases , we seek to formulate topological invariants for the various phases of the network model . a standard way to characterize gapped 3d phases is to calculate a triplet of chern numbers obtained by integrating the berry flux across sections of the 3d brillouin zone corresponding to the @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 planes @xcite .",

    "this phenomenon is unique to floquet systems , and can not occur with static hamiltonians . as we now argue , a similar phenomenon occurs in the 3d network model ,",
    "so that there are actually four topologically distinct gapped phases which can not be distinguished using chern number triplets .    to characterize these gapped phases , we introduce a `` topological pumping '' process @xcite . as originally introduced by brouwer _",

    "the idea is to roll a lattice into a cylinder with tunable phase slip @xmath0 along the azimuthal direction , and attach scattering leads to the ends of the cylinder .",

    "this concept can be applied directly to 2d network models , and has been used to experimentally distinguish between topological phases of a microwave network @xcite .",

    "this follows from the earlier observation that a weyl point with topological charge @xmath124 produces a phase singularity with winding number @xmath130 ( on the @xmath13 surface ) .",
    "a similar sort of winding behavior was previously noted by murakami and kuga @xcite , in the context of 3d quantum spin hall systems . they found that crossing a weyl phase between two spin hall insulators , such as a weak and strong topological insulator , produced a @xmath0-space motion of _ two _ pairs of weyl points .",
    "rather than wrapping around the brillouin zone , as in the present network model , the weyl points encircled a time - reversal invariant momentum point , and the net winding could be linked to a @xmath131 topological number @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have described a 3d network model exhibiting weyl , conventional insulator , and @xmath1-broken weak topological insulator phases .",
    "the 3d model is closely related to previously - studied 2d network models @xcite ; specifically , the weak topological insulator phases can be adiabatically continued to a stack of decoupled 2d anomalous floquet insulators ( which are `` anomalous '' because their bandstructures are topologically non - trivial despite all bands having zero chern number @xcite ) .",
    "our study relied in part on the `` topological pumping '' invariant , which relates bandstructure topology to reflection coefficients @xcite .",
    "though this method was originally developed with topological insulators in mind , we have shown that it has interesting applications to weyl phases : the weyl points produce phase singularities in the reflection spectrum , associated with the fermi arc surface states @xcite . from this",
    ", we found an intriguing correspondence between the topology of the insulator phases , and the @xmath0-space topology of weyl point trajectories as they wind around the brillouin zone . in this view , the various insulator phases are generated through the creation and annihilation of weyl point pairs with different @xmath0-space windings .    a promising route to realizing the network model is to use coupled microwave components , similar to the experiment reported in ref .   which realized a 2d topological pump acting on an anomalous floquet insulator .",
    "the network links would be microwave lines ( e.g.  coaxial cables ) , with line delays fixed at @xmath132 or @xmath5 ( the weyl point quasienergies ) .",

    "rather than implementing a large slab , tunable phase - shifters can simulate bloch boundary conditions @xcite , using two sets of phase - shifters corresponding to ( e.g. ) @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the key experimental signatures would be the phase singularities , and their @xmath0-space trajectories , as discussed in section [ sec : topological invariants ] .",
    "although an electromagnetic weyl phase has previously been realized @xcite , that photonic crystal - based experiment was unable to probe the topological features of the weyl points .",
    "our proposed approach would demonstrate the topological robustness of the weyl points through their association with phase singularities .",
    "this requires measuring complex wave parameters ( i.e. , including phase information ) , which is achievable with microwave vector network analyzers @xcite .",
    "the network model that we have chosen to study is , in a sense , the simplest non - trivial design that generalizes the chalker - coddington 2d network model to 3d , while maintaining similar network topology in the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 directions .",
    "we have focused on studying various interesting properties of the disorder - free network ; however , it is worth noting that the original motivation of network models was to provide a computationally efficient method for studying the effects of disorder @xcite . in future work , we intend to investigate whether such 3d network models can be used to model disordered weyl semimetals .",
    "3d network models with more complicated network topologies may also exhibit other topological phases remaining to be explored .",
