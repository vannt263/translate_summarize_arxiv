    "many physical processes can be described in terms of a random walker evolving in the phase space  @xcite , and one is often interested in assessing the portion of time @xmath0 that the system spends in a given region @xmath1 of the explored space , when observed up to time @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "this is key to understanding the dynamics of radiation transport , gas flows , research strategies or chemical / biological species migration in living bodies , only to mention a few , the time spent in @xmath1 being proportional to the interaction of particle with the target medium  @xcite .    for",
    "brownian motion , a celebrated approach to characterizing the probability density of the residence time @xmath0 has been provided by kac ( based on feynman path integrals ) in a series of seminal papers , and later extended to markov continuous - time processes  @xcite . for a review ,",
    "see for instance  @xcite",
    ". feynman - kac formalism basically allows writing down the evolution equation for the moment generating function of @xmath0 for arbitrary domains , initial conditions and displacement kernels .",
    "this approach has recently attracted a renovated interest  @xcite , and has been also extended to non - markovian processes  @xcite . as a particular case , imposing leakage boundary conditions leads to the formulation of first - passage problems  @xcite .",
    "however , for those physical systems that are intrinsically discrete , the natural variable is the number of hits @xmath3 in @xmath1 when the process is observed up to the @xmath4-th step , rather than time @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath3 is large , we can approximate the number of events falling in @xmath1 by @xmath5 ( the so - called diffusion limit ) , but this simple proportionality breaks down when @xmath1 is small with respect to the typical step size of the walker , and/or the effects of absorption are not negligible , so that the diffusion limit is not attained  @xcite .    in this paper , we derive a discrete feynman - kac equation for the evolution of the probability generating function of @xmath3 for a broad class of stochastic processes with scattering and absorption , and we illustrate this approach by explicitly working out calculations for some significant examples , such as the gambler s ruin problem , or the arcsine law . for the arcsine law , in particular , the feynman - kac formulae allow generalizing the well - known sparre andersen results to random walks with absorption . our analysis of the counting statistics is then completed by examining the moments of @xmath3 , which can also be obtained by building upon the feynman - kac formalism , and their asymptotic behavior when @xmath4 is large . in particular , we show that the asymptotic moments can be expressed as a function of the particle equilibrium distribution , which generalizes analogous results previously derived in terms of survival probabilities  @xcite .",

    "consider the random walk of a particle starting from an isotropic point - source @xmath6 located at @xmath7 . at each collision , the particle can be either scattered with probability @xmath8 , or absorbed with probability @xmath9 ( in which case the trajectory terminates ) .",

    ", we assume that scattering is isotropic , and that displacements are equally distributed .",
    "suppose that a particle emitted from @xmath7 is observed up to entering the @xmath4-th collision .",
    "our aim is to characterize the distribution @xmath13 , where @xmath3 is the number of collisions in a domain @xmath1 .",
    "we can formally define @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the marker function of the region @xmath1 , which takes the value @xmath16 when the point @xmath17 , and vanishes elsewhere .",
    "we adopt here the convention that the source is not counted , i.e. , the sum begins at @xmath18 .",
    "clearly , @xmath3 is a stochastic variable , depending on the realizations of the underlying process , and on the initial condition @xmath7 . the behavior of its distribution , @xmath13 , is most easily described in terms of the associated probability generating function @xmath19 which can be interpreted as the discrete laplace transform ( the transformed variable being @xmath20 ) of the collision number distribution .",
    "the derivation of an evolution equation for @xmath21 is made simpler if we initially consider trajectories starting with a particle entering its first collision at @xmath22 .",
    "random flights are semi - markovian ( i.e. , markovian at collision points ) , which allows splitting the trajectory into a first jump , from @xmath23 to @xmath24 ( the displacement @xmath25 obeying the jump length density @xmath26 ) , and then a path from @xmath24 to @xmath27 , conditioned to the fact that the collision at @xmath22 was a scattering event .",
    "if the collision is an absorption , the trajectory ends and there will be no further events contributing to @xmath3 .",

    "indeed , by construction the probability generating function @xmath37 is a polynomial in the variable @xmath20 , the coefficient of each power @xmath38 being @xmath39 . in particular , it follows that the probability that the particles never touch ( or come back to , if the source @xmath40 ) the domain @xmath1 is obtained by evaluating @xmath37 at @xmath41 , i.e. , @xmath42 .",
    "direct calculations based on the discrete feynman - kac formulae , eqs .   and  , are in some cases amenable to exact results concerning @xmath13 , at least for simple geometries and displacement kernels . in this section , we shall discuss some relevant examples .",
    "= 9.0 cm    consider a gambler whose initial amount of money is @xmath43 .",
    "at each ( discrete ) time step , the gambler either wins or loses a fair bet , and his capital increases or decreases , respectively , by some fixed quantity @xmath44 with equal probability",
    ". one might be interested in knowing the probability that the gambler is not ruined ( i.e. , that his capital has not reached zero , yet ) at the @xmath4-th bet , starting from the initial capital @xmath45 .",
    "this well - known problem  @xcite can be easily recast in the feynman - kac formalism by setting a particle in motion on a straight line , starting from @xmath45 , with scattering probability @xmath46 and a discrete displacement kernel @xmath47 .",

    "is the survival probability of the gambler : the first passage probability @xmath64 , i.e. , the probability that the gambler is ruined exactly at the @xmath4-th bet , can be obtained from @xmath65 . as a particular case , for @xmath66 and @xmath67 even , we recover the result in  @xcite , namely @xmath68    = 9.0 cm      consider a walker on a straight line , starting from @xmath45 .",
    "we are interested in assessing the distribution @xmath69 of the number of collisions @xmath3 that the walker performs at the right of the starting point , when observed up to the @xmath4-th collision .",
    "this amounts to choosing @xmath70 , @xmath71 being the heaviside step function , in eq .  .",
    "to fix the ideas , without loss of generality we set @xmath54 , and we initially assume that @xmath46 , i.e. , the walker can not be absorbed along the trajectory . this is a well known and long studied problem , for both markovian and non - markovian processes  @xcite : for brownian motion , the average residence time in @xmath1 is simply @xmath72 , whereas @xmath0 itself is known to obey the so called lvy s arcsine law @xmath73 , whose u shape basically implies that the particle will most often spend its time being always either on the positive or negative side of the axis  @xcite .",

    "when @xmath46 the distribution approaches a u shape , as expected .",
    "as soon as @xmath84 , the shape again changes abruptly , and in particular @xmath75 becomes strongly peaked at @xmath85 when absorption dominates scattering . when @xmath8 is small , @xmath75 decreases exponentially at large @xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath4 is large , @xmath75 approaches the asymptotic curve @xmath86 for @xmath87 , and @xmath88 .",

    "finally , the factorial moments @xmath103 for particles emitted at @xmath7 are obtained from @xmath104    when trajectories are observed up to @xmath105 , we can set @xmath106 , and from eq .",
    "we find @xmath107 for @xmath100 , provided that @xmath108 is finite .",
    "it turns out that the asymptotic moments @xmath108 are related to the equilibrium distribution of the particles  @xcite . to see this , we introduce the incident propagator @xmath109 , i.e. , the probability density of finding a particle emitted at @xmath7 entering the @xmath4-th collision ( @xmath53 ) at @xmath12 .",
    "we have @xmath110 with @xmath111 .",

    "now , by making use of the formal neumann series  @xcite , from eq .",
    "it follows that the collision density satisfies the stationary integral transport equation @xmath113 the transport equation   can be understood as follows : at equilibrium , the stationary particle density entering a collision at @xmath12 for a source emitting at @xmath7 is given by the sum of all contributions entering a collision at @xmath114 , being scattered and then transported to @xmath12 , plus the contribution of the particles emitted from the source and never collided up to entering @xmath12 .",
    "now , by resorting to the relation between @xmath26 and its adjoint @xmath115 in eq .  , and observing that at equilibrium ( for isotropic source and scattering ) @xmath116 then eq .   can be inverted ( see appendix  [ appendix_integral ] ) , and gives @xmath117 for @xmath100 , where @xmath118 is the solution of eq .  .",

    "we choose an exponential displacement kernel @xmath127 , with @xmath48 , which is often adopted as a simplified random walk model ( the so - called exponential flights ) to describe gas dynamics , radiation propagation or biological species migration  @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "the average @xmath125 is a measure of the passage of the particles through the region @xmath1 ( the deposited energy , for instance ) , whereas the second moment @xmath126 is proportional to the incertitude on the average  @xcite .    the calculations stemming from eqs .   and   are rather cumbersome , so that it is preferable to visually represent our results instead of writing down the explicit formulas . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we display the behavior of the moments @xmath125 and @xmath126 for the volume @xmath1 being the interval @xmath128 $ ] , with @xmath129 .",
    "when @xmath46 , the moments diverge as @xmath4 increases , since exponential flights in one dimension are recurrent random walks , and revisit their starting point infinitely many times .",
    "when @xmath130 , they converge instead to an asymptotic value , which can be computed based on eq .   by observing that the collision density for this example is @xmath131 as discussed in  @xcite",

    "[ fig6 ] shows that the moments decrease as the distance of the source @xmath45 from the region @xmath1 increases , as expected . as we have chosen here a symmetric interval , we have @xmath132 , so that we can plot the moments only for positive values of @xmath45 .",

    "other kinds of boundary conditions ( leakage , for instance , which implies that particles are lost upon crossing the frontier of @xmath1  @xcite ) have also been successfully tested , but will not be presented here .",
    "to conclude our analysis , in this section we comment on the scaling limit of the discrete feynman - kac equation , which is achieved when @xmath3 is large , and at the same time the typical jump length @xmath133 is vanishing small .",

    "we conclude by observing that a generalization of the present work to more realistic transport kernels , including anisotropic source and scattering , would be possible , for instance by resorting to the formalism proposed in  @xcite .",
    "moreover , while in this paper we have focused on counting statistics , and therefore chosen @xmath155 to be the marker function of a given domain in phase space , the feynman - kac formalism can be adapted with minor changes to describing the statistics of other kinds of functionals , such as for instance hitting probabilities  @xcite .",
