    "the np formalism  @xcite consists in an explicit expansion of the ricci and bianchi identities in a _",
    "null tetrad _ ,",
    "yielding a set of equations ( henceforth called np equations ) for the _ spin coefficients _ and _ curvature scalars_. under certain restrictions ( vacuum , algebraic type of the weyl and/or ricci tensors , etc ) one can choose a null tetrad in which some curvature scalars vanish bringing a simplification to the np equations . in some cases it is possible to perform a complete study of the consistency conditions of the constraints and their higher order differentials , thus enabling the classification of the family of solutions abiding by the restrictions imposed .",
    "the ghp formalism  @xcite further exploits the invariance of the null tetrad directions under the group of boost and spin transformations in order to work with those variables which are _ covariant _ under this group .",
    "this reduces the number of variables and simplifies the equations . from these considerations",
    ", we deduce that the ghp formalism is best suited for situations in which the boost - spin group is the natural invariance group in the geometric set - up .",
    "an important example of this can be found in the case of petrov type d solutions , where the two principal null directions of the weyl tensor are naturally invariant under boosts , and their orthogonal 2-plane is invariant under spins ( see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "the techniques described in the previous paragraph have been developed for the case of a four - dimensional ( 4d ) space - time , but the ideas are general for any dimension as explained in @xcite . in our work",
    "we analyse these ideas for the particular case of a 5d space - time . in this particular case ,",
    "one can still rely on spinor calculus to introduce the essential quantities of the formalisms , in the same way as in the 4d case .",
    "the basics of spinor calculus in a 5d space - time can be found in @xcite and we stress that the rationale behind many of our definitions lies in the use of spinors , even though this will not be made explicit in the present work .",
    "we start by introducing a _ semi - null pentad _ defined as follows @xmath1 the _ frame derivations _ associated to each element of this frame are denoted as follows : @xmath2 next we need to define the _ spin coefficients _ and the _ curvature scalars_. some of them coincide with the quantities appearing in the standard 4d np formalism ( this is to be expected as we work in a frame obtained from the np null tetrad by just adding the element @xmath3 ) . here",

    "@xmath63    the procedure is now to expand the ricci and bianchi identities in the semi - null pentad ( [ eq : semi - null - pentad ] ) and write them out in terms of the scalar quantities just introduced .",
    "the resulting equations are referred to as the 5d np equations and they can be regarded as an _ extension _ of the well - known 4d np equations .",
    "one can also compute the commutation relations of the operators defined in ( [ eq : frame - derivations ] ) in terms of the spin coefficients and again a set of equations is obtained which extends to dimension five the known commutation relations of the np formalism .    under the action of the boost - spin group",
    "the semi - null pentad transforms according to @xmath64 for some complex number @xmath65 . a scalar quantity @xmath66",
    "is said to be _ weighted _ if under ( [ eq : spin ] ) it transforms as @xmath67 for some integers @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( the pair @xmath70 being called the weight of @xmath66 ) .",
    "it is not difficult to check that all the curvature scalars are weighted quantities whereas only a subset of the spin coefficients is weighted .",
    "now , we can follow a procedure similar to the one presented in @xcite and introduce new derivations _",
    "covariant _ under boosts and spins .",
    "these new derivations turn out to be uniquely defined and are given by  @xcite @xmath71 where @xmath66 is a quantity with weight @xmath70 as in ( [ eq : scalar - weight ] ) .",

    "this implies a generalization of the 4d _ petrov types_. these are characterised by the _ weyl aligned null directions _ ( wands ) and their _",
    "alignment order_. the wands generalise the notion of _ principal null direction _ of a 4d weyl tensor .",
    "an important difference lies in the fact that the number of wands might be infinite or zero ( the latter being in fact the generic case ) in higher than four dimensions , whereas it is exactly four ( counting multiplicity ) in the 4d case .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for further details .    in view of the complete classification of the 4d petrov type d vacuum space - times ( containing the well - known vacuum black hole solutions )",
    "@xcite it is natural to endeavor the classification of 5d petrov type d vacua ( or _ einstein spaces _ ) . by definition , these are space - times ( possibly admitting a cosmological constant @xmath62 ) with vanishing trace - free ricci tensor and exhibiting a pair of double wands spanned by @xmath74 and @xmath75 at each point . taking these as the first two vectors of a semi - null pentad , the only surviving components of the weyl tensor are the zero boost - weight weyl scalars @xmath76 it turns out that the resulting ghp equations and its consequences are rather unmanageable , although some general properties ( even in general dimensions ) were deduced in @xcite . in order to simplify the computations further , we restricted ourselves to the class @xmath77 , defined by the property that the riemann ( or weyl ) tensor is isotropic in a plane orthogonal to @xmath74 and @xmath75 . taking the pentad vectors @xmath78 and @xmath79 along the complex null directions of this plane and @xmath3 along its normal , only the @xmath80-weighted weyl scalars @xmath50 and @xmath81 are possibly non - zero .",
