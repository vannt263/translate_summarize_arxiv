    "an optical vortex is a light field exhibiting a pure screw phase dislocation along the propagation axis ; i.e. , an azimuthal phase dependence @xmath0 .",
    "the integer @xmath1 plays the role of a topological charge : the phase changes its value by @xmath1 cycles of @xmath2 in any closed circuit about the axis , while the amplitude is zero there  @xcite .",
    "one of the most intriguing properties of vortices is that they carry orbital angular momentum ( oam ) .",
    "this was first realized by allen and coworkers  @xcite for the important instance of laguerre - gauss ( lg ) laser modes .",
    "furthermore , they demonstrated that these modes carry an oam of @xmath3 per photon along the propagation direction .",
    "a useful feature of optical oam is that it can be easily manipulated and transferred ; this has opened new horizons in various fields , ranging from mechanical micro - manipulation  @xcite to imaging sciences  @xcite , as well as potential astronomical  @xcite and communication applications  @xcite . beyond optical wavelengths ,",
    "oam now plays a major role in electron  @xcite , x - ray  @xcite and radio frequency engineering  @xcite .",
    "the core observation that individual photons also carry oam brings the most exciting possibilities for employing this variable in the quantum regime , and a number of uses has already been demonstrated  @xcite    despite this intense activity , very little attention has been paid thus far to the radial index @xmath4 of the lg modes .",
    "usually , it is stated that for @xmath5 , the modes are multiringed with @xmath6 radial nodes . beyond this short mention",
    ", no physical meaning is attached to this quantity .",
    "two recent papers , however , have presented challenging and interesting insights into this issue  @xcite . our purpose here is to present a simple comprehensive analysis of this variable .    the two aforementioned papers considered optical modes , governed by the paraxial wave equation .",
    "these modes are ultimately suitably rescaled wave functions of the stationary states of a two - dimensional quantum oscillator , under the schrdinger equation  @xcite . since",
    "this latter system can properly model other interesting vortices arising in different media ( as in plasmas  @xcite , superfluids  @xcite , and bose - einstein condensates  @xcite ) , the oscillator will serve as our thread , bearing in mind that the results can be immediately translated to the optical case .",
    "to be as self - contained as possible , we briefly review the example of an isotropic two - dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator of mass @xmath7 and natural frequency @xmath8 , with coordinates in two orthogonal axes , say @xmath9 and @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian can be compactly written as @xmath11 , where the total number operator @xmath12 is @xmath13 and the annihilation and creation operators fulfil the canonical commutation relations @xmath14",
    "= \\delta_{jk } { \\hat{\\openone}}$ ] , with @xmath15 .",
    "since the spectrum of @xmath16 is composed of all non - negative integers @xmath17 , the energies are given by @xmath18 and these eigenvalues are @xmath19-fold degenerate .",
    "elements of the fock basis are the common eigenvectors of @xmath20 and @xmath21 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the ground state .",
    "the stationary states of the oscillator are the product of hermite - gauss modes , as the oscillations in each axes are kinematically independent : @xmath24 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath25 .",
    "to recover the equivalent beam solutions , one needs to take @xmath26 , since the paraxial wave equation ( in adimensional coordinates ) coincides with the schrdinger equation for the oscillator when @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    for our purposes ,",
    "the solution at @xmath29 is enough .",
    "the wave function at any other time can be obtained in a simple way by using the explicit form of the propagator . for beams , where the role of time is played by the coordinate @xmath30 along the symmetry axis",
    ", this propagation brings about additional interesting points , such as the gouy phase .",
    "the axes @xmath9 and @xmath10 do not enjoy a privileged role in the problem .",
    "since the energy is invariant under rotations in the @xmath31 plane , we could as well have chosen any other rotated reference frame . to take a better advantage of this symmetry , we consider the @xmath30-component of the angular momentum , @xmath32 , with @xmath33 , and use the rotated bosonic operators  @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 = \\delta_{jk } { \\hat{\\openone}}$ ] , with @xmath36 .",
    "we can then check that @xmath37 whose interpretation is direct : the system can be envisioned now as consisting of `` quanta '' with positive ( counterclockwise rotation around @xmath30 ) and negative ( clockwise rotation around @xmath30 ) orbital angular momentum .",
    "the fock basis @xmath38 of the common eigenvectors of @xmath39 and @xmath40 can be constructed much in the same way as in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) . however , it will prove useful to consider instead the continuous set @xmath41 parametrized by the complex number @xmath42 . the states @xmath43 constitute an orthonormal basis , whose properties have been reviewed in depth in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the representation",
    "they generate [ @xmath44 , the action of the basic operators is @xmath45 while for the adjoints we have @xmath46 since the exponential acting on the vacuum in eq .",
    "is not unitary , the creation and destruction operators are not conjugates one of the other under the usual boson conjugation .    given the above , @xmath12 and @xmath47 act in this space as @xmath48    as @xmath49 = 0 $ ] , the basis @xmath50 can be reinterpreted as common eigenvectors of @xmath12 and @xmath47 , with eigenvalues @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "the stationary states in this basis can be readily obtained using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nldif ] ) ; the final result is @xmath53 where the normalized amplitude is @xmath54 @xmath55 are the generalized laguerre polynomials and we have written @xmath56 .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath57 shows @xmath4 dark concentric rings .",
    "since the number of dark rings is @xmath58 , the operator @xmath59 seems to be a sensible definition for the radial - number operator of the laguerre - gauss modes . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : nldif ] ) , in differential form it reads @xmath60 incidentally , it coincides with the operator found in ref .",
    "@xcite by setting @xmath61 .    to simplify the following discussion ,",
    "let us , for the time being , relabel the stationary states @xmath62 as @xmath63 , where @xmath4 indicates the radial mode eigenvalue ; i.e. , @xmath64 as heralded in the introduction , we are interested in exploring the hilbert space associated with the radial number @xmath4 , while keeping the oam @xmath1 fixed . at first sight , one might look for the canonical conjugate variable to @xmath65 . since , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : defp ] ) , @xmath66 or @xmath39 ( depending on the sign of @xmath1 ) , such a variable would be a phase @xmath67 or @xmath68 .",
    "this means that if we denote by @xmath69 the exponential of such a putative phase , the corresponding commutation relation will read  @xcite @xmath70 = { \\hat{e } } \\ , .\\ ] ] this immediately implies @xmath71 so that @xmath72 whereas the spectrum of @xmath47 is unbounded , including all the integer numbers , the spectrum of @xmath65 is semibounded , as it comprises only non - negative integers .",
    "this indicates that the action of @xmath73 as a ladder operator fails at @xmath74 , and consequently it can not be unitary : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the projector on the `` vacuum . ''",
    "all these problems thus place this interpretation on shaky grounds . for this reason",
    ", we prefer to follow an alternative route . to this end",
    ", we observe that to increase ( decrease ) the radial number by one unit , with @xmath1 unchanged , we need to create ( annihilate ) one positive quantum and one negative quantum , namely @xmath77 one can check that @xmath78   =   - 2 { \\hat{k}}_{z } \\ , ,    \\quad    [ { \\hat{k}}_{z } , { \\hat{k}}_{+ } ] = { \\hat{k}}_{+ } \\ , ,    \\quad    [ { \\hat{k}}_{z } , { \\hat{k}}_{- } ] = - { \\hat{k}}_{- } \\ , , \\ ] ] with @xmath79 .",
    "this means that if we define @xmath80 , we have @xmath81   =   - i { \\hat{k}}_{z } \\ , ,    \\quad    [ { \\hat{k}}_{y } , { \\hat{k}}_{z } ] = i { \\hat{k}}_{x } \\ , ,    \\quad    [ { \\hat{k}}_{z } , { \\hat{k}}_{x } ] = i { \\hat{k}}_{y } \\ , , \\ ] ] that is , they are the generators of the su(1 , 1 ) algebra , as first noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite .      to explore the issue in more detail , it is convenient to give some basic background on some well - known irreducible representations ( irreps ) of su(1,1 ) , which are excellently reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite and whose role in quantum optics is difficult to underestimate  @xcite .",
    "the casimir operator for this group is @xmath82 , which can be expressed as @xmath83 , where the bargmann index @xmath84 labels the different irreps ( this index plays the role of spin for rotations ) . in our case",
    ", a simple calculation shows that @xmath85 , so that @xmath86 , which corresponds to the so - called positive discrete series , for which @xmath87 is diagonal and has a discrete spectrum . in the fock basis @xmath38 , the basis states of the irrep @xmath84 are @xmath88 , with @xmath89 , and hence @xmath90 while the ladder operators act as @xmath91 note that we can make the identification @xmath92 , provided @xmath93 .    since @xmath94",
    ", this state can be taken as the vacuum .",
    "indeed , @xmath95 are truly displacement operators , so according to perelomov prescription  @xcite , the set @xmath96 constitutes a family of _ bona fide _ coherent states parametrized by the pseudo - euclidean unit vector @xmath97 , with @xmath98 and @xmath99 .    by expanding the exponential and employing the disentangling theorem",
    ", we get the decomposition @xmath100 and by projecting over the complete basis @xmath101 we get the corresponding wave function @xmath102 in the transverse parameters .",
    "the expression can be simplified into an exponential form using the identity @xmath103 so the final result is @xmath104^{\\frac{|\\ell|+1}{2 } } \\!\\ !",

    "they are also eigenstates of the oam , and shape invariant in the time evolution .     for a coherent state @xmath105 with @xmath106 as as a function of @xmath4 and the ring average number @xmath107 . ]",
    "the average number of sharp rings in the state @xmath108 is @xmath109 and the statistical distribution of rings @xmath110 is @xmath111 in fig .  1 we have plotted this distribution for a coherent state with @xmath106 and different values of @xmath107 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : trans1 ] , we have plotted @xmath112 for a coherent state with @xmath106 and @xmath113 , and the corresponding distribution for the laguerre - gauss eigenstate with @xmath114 .",
    "the striking differences can be appreciated at a glance .",
    "it is worth mentioning that there is an alternative definition of coherent states , due to barut and girardello  @xcite : @xmath115 which appears as a reasonable generalization of the standard coherent states as eigenstates of the annihilation operator .",
    "this equation can be solved in the @xmath116 basis , yielding @xmath117 this set of coherent states are thus realized as bessel - gauss modes .",

    "according to the standard definition , squeezing occurs whenever  @xcite @xmath121 intelligent states are those for which ( [ eq : ur ] ) holds as an equality .",
