    "hence , each cohomology class in @xmath0 can be represented by a @xmath6-form @xmath7 where the @xmath8 are polynomial functions on @xmath1",

    "it is a long standing open question in algorithmic real algebraic geometry to find a single exponential time algorithm for computing the betti numbers of a semialgebraic set .",
    "single exponential time algorithms are known , e.g. , for counting the connected components and computing the euler characteristic of a semialgebraic set ( for an overview see  @xcite , for details and exhaustive bibliography see  @xcite ) .",
    "the best result in this direction states that for fixed @xmath9 one can compute the first @xmath9 betti numbers of a semialgebraic set in single exponential time  @xcite .    over the complex numbers , one approach for computing betti numbers is to compute the algebraic de rham cohomology . in  @xcite the de rham cohomology of the complement of a complex affine variety",

    "this algorithm is extended in @xcite to compute the cohomology of a projective variety",
    ". however , the complexity of these algorithms is not analyzed , and due to their use of grbner bases a good worst - case complexity is not to be expected . in  @xcite a single exponential time ( in fact",

    "namely , this paper shows how to compute the de rham cohomology of a smooth projective variety in parallel polynomial time . in terms of structural complexity , these results are the best one can hope for , since the problem of computing a fixed betti number ( e.g. , deciding connectedness ) of a complex affine or projective variety defined over the integers is @xmath11-hard  @xcite .    besides being relevant for algorithms , our question also has connections to the theory of ordinary differential equations .",

    "it seems that their proof can be considerably generalized to solutions of certain linear systems of pfaffian differential equations .",
    "examples of such systems are provided by period matrices of polynomial maps , once the corresponding gauss - manin connexion can be explicitly constructed . for this construction",
    "one needs degree bounds for generators of the cohomology of the generic fibers of the polynomial map .",
    "it follows from the results of  @xcite that if @xmath1 has no singularities at infinity , i.e. , the projective closure of @xmath1 in @xmath12 is smooth , then each class in @xmath5 can be represented by a differential form of degree at most @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the maximal codimension of the irreducible components of @xmath1 .",
