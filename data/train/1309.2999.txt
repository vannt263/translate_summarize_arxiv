    "[ sec : intro ]    dense cores and clouds are the birthplaces of stars and their planetary systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and it is therefore important to know their composition .",
    "gas phase abundances are strongly reduced in these environments as species freeze out onto grains ( co , cs ; @xcite ) , and new molecules are formed by grain surface chemistry ( e.g. , h@xmath1o , ch@xmath17 , co@xmath1 , @xcite ) .",
    "infrared spectroscopy of the vibrational absorption bands of ices against the continuum emission of background stars is thus a powerful tool to determine the composition of dense media @xcite .",
    "the taurus molecular cloud ( tmc ) is the first cloud in which frozen h@xmath1o @xcite , co @xcite , and co@xmath1 @xcite were detected using background stars .",
    "this is also the case for the 6.85 @xmath0  band @xcite , whose carrier is uncertain ( possibly nh@xmath18 ) .",
    "recently solid ch@xmath6oh was discovered toward several isolated dense cores @xcite .",
    "these and follow up studies showed that the ice abundances depend strongly on the environment .",
    "the extinction threshold for h@xmath1o ice formation is a factor of two higher for the ophiuchus ( oph ) cloud than it is for tmc ( @xmath1910 - 15 versus 3.2 mag ; @xcite ) .",
    "these variations may reflect higher local interstellar radiation fields ( e.g. , hot stars in the oph neighborhood ) , which remove h@xmath1o and its precursors from the grains either by photodesorption or sublimation at the cloud edge @xcite .",
    "deeper in the cloud , ice mantle formation may be suppressed by shocks and radiation fields from young stellar objects ( ysos ) , depending on the star formation rate ( sfr ) and initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "the latter may apply in particular to the freeze out of the volatile co species , and , indirectly , to ch@xmath6oh .",
    "co freeze out sets the gas phase h / co ratio , which sets the ch@xmath6oh formation rate @xcite .",
    "high ch@xmath6oh abundances may be produced on time scales that depend on dust temperature and other local conditions ( e.g. , shocks ) .",
    "this may well explain the observed large ch@xmath6oh abundance variations : @xmath20(ch@xmath6oh)/@xmath20(h@xmath1o)@xmath21% toward tmc background stars @xcite and @xmath22% toward some isolated dense cores @xcite .    the number of dense clouds and the number of sight - lines within each cloud observed with mid - infrared spectroscopy ( @xmath23 @xmath0 ) is small .",
    "ice and silicate inventories were determined toward four tmc and one serpens cloud background stars @xcite",
    ". many more lines of sight were recently studied toward isolated dense cores @xcite .",
    "these cores have different physical histories and conditions , however , and may not be representative of dense clouds .",
    "their interstellar media lack the environmental influences of outflows and the resulting turbulence often thought to dominate in regions of clustered star formation ( clouds ) .",
    "their star formation time scales can be significantly larger due to the dominance of magnetic fields over turbulence and the resulting slow process of ambipolar diffusion @xcite . over time , the ice composition likely reflects the physical history of the environment .",
    "this , in turn may be preserved in the ices in envelopes , disks and planetary systems .",
    "quiescent cloud and core ices are converted to more complex organics in yso envelopes @xcite .",
    "2d collapse models of ysos show that subsequently all but the most volatile envelope ices ( co , n@xmath1 ) survive the infall phase up to radii @xmath24 au from the star @xcite .",
    "they are processed at radii @xmath25 au , further increasing the chemical complexity .",
    "for this reason , it is required to determine the ice abundances in a larger diversity of quiescent environments . a spitzer spectroscopy program ( p.i . c. knez ) was initiated to observe large samples of background stars , selected from 2mass and spitzer photometric surveys of the nearby lupus , serpens , and perseus molecular clouds .",
    "this paper focuses on the lupus cloud .",
    "upcoming papers will present mid - infrared spectroscopy of stars behind the serpens and perseus clouds .",
    "the lupus cloud complex is one of the main nearby low mass star forming regions .",
    "it is located near the scorpius - centaurus ob association and consists of a loosely connected group of clouds extended over @xmath2620 degrees ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the lupus i , iii , and iv clouds were mapped with spitzer / irac and mips broad band filters , and analyzed together with 2mass near infrared maps @xcite . in this paper , only stars behind the lupus i and iv clouds will be studied .",
    "this is the first study of lupus background stars .",
    "compared to other nearby clouds , the lupus clouds likely experienced less impact from nearby massive stars and internal ysos . while ob stars in the scorpius - centaurus association may have influenced the formation of the clouds , they are relatively far away ( @xmath27 pc ) and their current impact on the lupus clouds is most likely smaller compared to that of massive stars on the oph , serpens , and perseus clouds @xcite .",
    "likewise , star formation within the lupus clouds is characterized by a relatively low sfr , 0.83 m@xmath28/myr / pc@xmath29 , versus 1.3 , 2.3 , and 3.2 for perseus , ophiuchus and the serpens clouds , respectively @xcite .",
    "in addition , the mean stellar mass of the ysos ( 0.2 m@xmath28 ; @xcite ) is low compared to that of other clouds ( e.g. , serpens 0.7 m@xmath28 ) as well as to that of the imf ( 0.5 m@xmath28 ) .",
    "lupus also stands out with a low fraction of class i ysos @xcite . within lupus ,",
    "the different clouds have distinct characteristics . while herschel detections of prestellar cores and class 0 ysos indicate that both lupus i and iv have an increasing sfr , star formation in lupus iv has just begun , considering its low number of prestellar sources @xcite .",
    "the lupus iv cloud is remarkable in that the spitzer - detected ysos are distributed away from the highest extinction regions .",
    "extinction maps produced by the c2d team show that lupus iv contains a distinct extinction peak , while lupus i has a lower , more patchy extinction ( @xmath30=32.6 versus 26.5 mag at a resolution of 120@xmath31 ) .",
    "it is comparable to the serpens cloud ( 33.5 mag at 120@xmath31 resolution ) , but factors of 1.5 - 2 lower compared to the perseus and ophiuchus clouds .",
    "both volatiles and refractory dust can be traced in the mid - infrared spectra of background stars .",
    "this paper combines the study of ice and silicate features with line of sight extinctions .",
    "the ice formation threshold toward lupus is investigated as well as the relation of the 9.7 @xmath0  band of silicates with the continuum extinction .",
    "the 9.7 @xmath0  band was extensively studied toward background stars tracing dense clouds and cores .",
    "while no differences were found between clouds and cores , its strength and shape are distinctly different compared to the diffuse ism .",
    "the peak optical depth of the 9.7  @xmath0  band relative to the k - band continuum extinction is a factor of @xmath262 smaller in dense lines of sight @xcite .",
    "the short wavelength wing is also more pronounced .",
    "grain growth can not explain these effects simultaneously @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the same spectra of background stars show grain growth by increased continuum extinction at longer wavelengths ( up to at least 25  @xmath0 ; @xcite ) , in agreement with broad band studies @xcite .",
    "the selection of the background stars is described in  [ sec : sou ] , and the reduction of the ground - based and _ spitzer _ spectra in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] . in ",
    "[ sec : cont ] , the procedure to fit the stellar continua is presented , a crucial step in which ice and silicate features are separated from stellar features and continuum extinction .",
    "subsequently , in ",
    "[ sec : col ] , the peak and integrated optical depths of the ice and dust features are derived , as well as column densities for the identified species . then in  [ sec:60 ] , the derived parameters @xmath9 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are correlated with each other .  [ sec : thresh ] discusses the lupus ice formation threshold and how it compares to other clouds .",

    "[ sec : complex ] .",
    "the @xmath9 versus @xmath33 relation , and in particular the transition from diffuse to dense cloud values , is discussed in  [ sec : tauak ] .",

    "the @xmath15 ratio in lupus is slightly less than that of isolated dense cores for lines of sight with @xmath14 mag , i.e. , it is a factor of 2 lower compared to the diffuse medium . below 1.0 mag values scatter between the dense and diffuse medium ratios .",
    "the absence of a gradual transition between diffuse and dense medium - type dust indicates that local conditions matter in the process that sets the @xmath15 ratio .",
    "it is found that the reduction of @xmath15 ratio in the lupus dense clouds is most likely related to grain growth , which occurs in some sight - lines and not in others .",
    "it is , however , not directly related to ice mantle formation .",
    "conversely , ice mantles may form on grains before the process of grain coagulation has started .",
    "future work needs to study the @xmath15 ratio at @xmath191 mag in more detail in both the dense and diffuse ism to address the conditions that set the transition between the two environments .",
    "all aspects of this work will benefit from improved stellar models .",
    "current models often do not simultaneously fit the strengths of the 2.4 @xmath0  co overtone band , the co fundamental near 5.3 @xmath0 , and the sio band near 8.0 @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , the search for weak ice bands , such as that of ch@xmath6oh at 3.53 @xmath0  band , is limited by the presence of narrow photospheric lines .",
    "correction for photospheric lines will become the limiting factor in high s / n spectra at this and longer wavelengths and higher spectral resolution with new facilities ( sofia , jwst , tmt ) .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for detailed comments that improved the presentation of the results .",
