    "the dressing process does not distinguish between u and d quarks at high momentum transfers since in the description of perturbative qcd the gluon couplings are flavor blind .",
    "in the conventional perturbative picture the only difference between the proton and neutron production arises from the different electric charges of the primary quark - antiquark pairs .",

    "the reaction @xmath18 at energies around the @xmath11 threshold is highly nonperturbative , hence the problem must be tackled in a nonperturbative manner . in this work we model the reactions by the nonperturbative @xmath19 quark dynamics which describes quark - antiquark annihilation and creation .",
    "it was shown that the @xmath19 approach is phenomenologically successful in the description of hadronic couplings  @xcite .",
    "the reaction @xmath18 may arise from two different processes : ( 1 ) the primary @xmath2 pair is dressed directly by two additional quark - antiquark pairs created out of the vacuum to form a baryon pair ; and ( 2 ) the primary @xmath2 pair forms a virtual vector meson first , then the virtual vector meson decays into a baryon pair .",
    "we expect that the second process is dominant over the first because of the considerable success of the vector dominance model .",
    "the importance of the second process is also discussed in the work @xcite .",
    "our work is arranged as follows : we study the reaction @xmath18 in the one - step and two - step processes in sec . ii and iii , respectively .",
    "we give our conclusions in sec .",
    "the reaction @xmath18 may arise from the following process : the @xmath21 pair annihilates into a virtual time - like photon , the virtual photon decays into a @xmath2 pair , and finally the @xmath2 pair is dressed by two additional quark - antiquark pairs created out of the vacuum to form a nucleon - antinucleon pair , as shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
