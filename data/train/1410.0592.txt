    "a _ tiling _ of @xmath1 is a collection of tiles @xmath2 that is a covering ( i.e. @xmath3 ) as well as a packing ( i.e. the intersection of the interiors of two distinct tiles @xmath4 and @xmath5 is empty ) .",
    "the @xmath4 are called _ tiles _ of the tiling . for our purposes",
    "it is fine to think of the tiles as nice compact sets like squares or triangles .",
    "if all tiles in the tiling belong to finitely many congruence classes @xmath6 , \\ldots , [ t_m]$ ] then we call the representatives @xmath7 _ prototiles _ of the tiling . any finite subset of a tiling is called a _ patch_. examples of patches of a tiling are obtained by intersecting a tiling @xmath8 with a ball @xmath9 , i.e. with an open ball of radius @xmath10 with centre @xmath11 .",

    "one can formalise this by considering pairs @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is some tile and @xmath15 encodes the additional attribute . in order to keep notation simple we keep in mind to distinguish a black unit square from a red unit square when necessary without writing down the additional label @xmath15 .    a vector @xmath16 such that @xmath17 is called _ period _ of @xmath8 .",
    "( if @xmath18 then @xmath19 means @xmath20 . )",
    "a tiling @xmath8 is called _ periodic _ if it has a nontrivial period , i.e. a period @xmath21 .",

    "a tiling @xmath8 is called _ nonperiodic _ if its only period is the trivial period @xmath22 .    a _ substitution rule _",
    "@xmath23 is a simple method to generate nonperiodic tilings .",
    "the basic idea is to substitute each prototile @xmath24 with a patch @xmath25 consisting of congruent copies of some of the prototiles @xmath26 .",
    "the penrose tilings can be generated by a substitution rule with two prototiles , see @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "a simpler example using just one prototiles is shown in figure [ fig : subst - bsp ] : a substitution rule for the _ chair tiling_. the chair tiling is nonperiodic , even though it contains large 2-periodic subsets @xcite .    , width=377 ]    given a substitution @xmath23 with prototiles @xmath26 a patch of the form @xmath25 is called _ supertile_. more generally , a patch of the form @xmath27 is called _",

    "before we give a more precise description let us first illustrate the idea of the construction .",
    "we start with a square @xmath30 of edge length two centred in the origin , see figure [ fig : gen0 - 3 ] left .",
    "( we may imagine this and further squares cut out of cardboard or similar . ) in the next step we remove @xmath30 ( but keep its position in mind ) ; we take four translates of @xmath30 , and we place the first one one unit to the left with respect to @xmath30 .",

    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : gen0 - 3 ] second from the left .",
    "let us call this constellation of four overlapping squares @xmath34 .",
    ", width=415 ]    we proceed in similar way : we take four translates of @xmath34 and put one translate two units to the left with respect to @xmath34 , a second translate ( rotated by @xmath31 ) two units up with respect to @xmath34 and below the first translate , a third translate ( rotated by @xmath35 ) two units to the right with respect to @xmath34 and below the second translate , and a fourth translate ( rotated by @xmath36 ) two units down with respect to @xmath34 and below the third translate .",
    "the result @xmath37 , as seen from above , is shown in figure [ fig : gen0 - 3 ] second from the right .",
    "the next generations are constructed analogously , just replace @xmath34 by @xmath38 and 2 by @xmath39 in the last paragraph . in this way",
    "we can cover arbitrary large parts of the plane . in order to translate this covering into a tiling we consider only the visible ( parts of ) squares .",
    "thus the tiling has four prototiles : a large square with edge length two , a small square with edge length one , a @xmath40 rectangle , and a `` chair '' , i.e. a non - convex hexagon that is the union of three small squares . the more subtle question how this sequence of finite patterns yields an infinite tiling of the plane",
    "is answered below .",
    "briefly , we use the fact that the central patches of the @xmath41 are fixed under the iteration .",
    "these patches yield a nested sequence @xmath42 of patches with a well defined limit which is an infinite tiling .",
    "now we give a more precise description of the construction of the sequence of patches .",
    "let @xmath43 denote a rotation through @xmath44 about the origin . start with a square @xmath45 ^ 2 $ ] . in the following we need to keep track about which squares",
    "lie `` above '' ( parts of ) other squares . in order to achieve this",
    "we may equip each square with an additional label .",
    "one may write @xmath46 and consider the label @xmath15 as the `` height '' of @xmath47 in some orthogonal direction . anyway",
    ", this idea leads to a tedious description of the construction that we omit here . for our purposes",
    "it is sufficient just to keep track which squares are higher respectively lower than other squares .    let @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath49 where the first square is on top of the other squares , the second square is below the first one but above the third and the fourth square , and the fourth square is on bottom . in the @xmath50th step",
    "let @xmath51 consist of four congruent copies of @xmath52 : @xmath53 all squares in the first set are on top of the squares in the other three sets , the squares in the second set all are below the squares in the first set but on top of all squares in the third set and the fourth set , and the squares in the fourth set are all below the squares in the other three sets .",
    "two squares within one of the sets @xmath54 inherit their above - below relation from the preceding steps in the iteration .",
    "note that the centres of the squares are contained in the lattice translate @xmath55 hence , by the construction , the centre of each of the congruent copies of @xmath56 ( i.e. the single point that is the intersection of the four squares in the copy of @xmath56 ) is contained in @xmath57 . since each",

    "any @xmath64 with exactly one integer coordinate is covered by three squares in @xmath51 ( the interior of one square and some common edge of two further squares ; again if @xmath50 is large enough ) , and any @xmath64 with two integer coordinates is covered by four squares ( midpoints of edges ) if @xmath65 is even , and by five squares ( the centre of one square and the common vertex of four further squares ) if @xmath65 is odd .",

    "we will mainly consider one particular tiling : the _ arrowed tiling _",
    "@xmath68 that is obtained by decorating the underlying square @xmath69 with arrows and colours as shown in figure [ fig : arrow ] ( left ) .     applied to squares with certain decorations .",
    "a single square @xmath69 is shown on the left : the decoration divides @xmath69 into four unit squares of distinct colours , where each unit square carries an arrow in addition .",
    "these decorated unit squares yield the tiles of the tiling @xmath68 .",
    "[ fig : arrow],width=415 ]    the tiling @xmath68 is obtained by considering what we see viewing @xmath51 from `` above '' , where @xmath51 now consists of congruent copies of the decorated square @xmath69 .",

    "we want to consider @xmath68 as a tiling by unit squares with decoration as prototiles where the unit squares carry an arrow as well as a colour ( here : black , dark grey , light grey , white ) . from now on the term `` tile '' always denotes such a unit square with decoration , if not mentioned otherwise .",
    "regarding the point how to obtain a tiling of the entire plane from the finite patches @xmath51 , a very natural approach and a very useful one  is considering the limit @xmath73 , where the limit is taken with respect to the local topology @xcite .",
    "in particular , in this topology two tilings are @xmath74-close if they agree in a ball of radius @xmath75 centred in the origin .",
    "for our purposes we may define the distance @xmath76 between two tilings @xmath77 by @xmath78 where @xmath79 denotes the open ball of radius @xmath10 centred in 0 . in order to make @xmath80 into a metric , i.e. in order to ensure transitivity , we define @xmath81 compare @xcite .",
    "we will see in the sequel that the central parts @xmath82 of @xmath51 for @xmath83 form a nested sequence @xmath84 where @xmath82 has support @xmath85 , hence the sequence @xmath51or any sequence of tilings @xmath86 where @xmath87 contains @xmath51 as its central patch",

    "a tiling @xmath8 is _ repetitive _ if for each @xmath123 there is @xmath187 such that each patch of radius less than @xmath10 is contained in each patch of radius @xmath188 . if @xmath189 then @xmath8 is called _",
    "linearly repetitive_.    moreover , a tiling @xmath8 has _ uniform patch frequencies _ if the frequencies of all patches are well - defined .",
    "more precisely : if @xmath158 is a patch in @xmath8 then let @xmath190 denote the number of congruent copies of @xmath158 in @xmath191 , where @xmath9 denotes the open ball of radius @xmath10 centred in @xmath11 .",
    "if for all patches @xmath158 in @xmath8 the limit @xmath192 exists uniformly in @xmath11 then @xmath8 has _ uniform patch frequencies_. for a more thorough discussion of repetitivity or uniform patch frequencies see @xcite or @xcite .",
    "we omit it here since we need the terms only to state the following result .",
    "all @xmath185 are linearly repetitive and have uniform patch frequencies .    by a result of solomyak ( * ? ? ? * lemma 2.3 ) each primitive substitution tiling in @xmath1 with finite local complexity is linearly repetitive .    by a result of lagarias and pleasants (",
    "* theorem 6.1 ) linear repetitivity implies uniform patch frequencies .    the fact that our tilings possess the particular structure ( union of periodic packings ) described by remark [ rem : limper+diag ] is a hint that they are possibly _ limitperiodic_. in this particular case this means that they can be generated by a certain cut - and - project method using a lattice in @xmath193 , where @xmath194 denotes the field of 2-adic numbers .",
    "structures of this kind are called _ model sets ( with 2-adic internal space)_. model sets are relevant since by a result of hof @xcite all models sets show pure point diffraction .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to give details on this , but we may formulate the result and prove it using a simple to check sufficient condition .",
    "properly speaking , model sets are discrete point sets , not tilings .",
    "hence our tilings are not model sets , but they are strongly related : they are mutually locally derivable ( mld ) with model sets , meaning that there is a local rule transforming one into the other ( see @xcite ) .    all @xmath185 are limitperiodic .",
    "consequently , all @xmath185 are mutually locally derivable with model sets , hence pure point diffractive .",
    "since @xmath68 is a primitive substitution tiling with integer scaling factor ( in this case 2 ) and @xmath23 is a _ block substitution _",
    "( since each unit square is mapped to four unit squares in a @xmath195 grid ) we can apply a result in @xcite and @xcite : we need to show that @xmath23 has a modular coincidence . by a result in @xcite",
    "this is the case if there is a _ coincidence _ in the supertiles . for this",
    "it suffices to note that the upper right tile in @xmath196 and @xmath197 is a black tile @xmath153 with its arrow pointing down right , compare figure [ fig : subst ] .",
    "( the lower left tile in all four cases is @xmath163 , yielding a second coincidence . ) for further details see @xcite .",
    "the fact that @xmath68 is pure point diffractive has consequences if one imagines @xmath68 as a physical solid : assume that in such a solid the four different types of atoms ( or molecules ) are arranged in the same pattern as the four different tiles in @xmath68 . a diffraction experiment",
    "would then show a diffraction image with bright spots ( `` bragg peaks '' ) and ( ideally ) no diffuse parts .",
    "now that we have obtained several results on the arrowed tiling @xmath68 we turn our attention to the naked tiling using no decoration at all , compare figure [ fig : gen0 - 3 ] .",
    "let us called the tiling obtained by the same construction but with undecorated squares @xmath198 .",
    "a tiling @xmath199 is called _ locally derivable _ from a tiling @xmath200 if there is a local rule transforming @xmath200 into @xmath199 .",
    "two tilings @xmath201 are called _ mutually locally derivable _",
    "if @xmath199 is locally derivable from @xmath200 and vice versa @xcite .",
    "the naked tiling @xmath198 is locally derivable from the arrowed tiling @xmath68 .",
    "it suffices to give a local rule to transform @xmath68 into @xmath198 .",
    "considering that in the arrow decoration of @xmath68 the arrows point always away from the centre of the large square , the arrows determine locally the edges of the large ( overlapping ) squares in a unique way .",
    "the edges of the overlapping squares determine @xmath198 .",
    "two tilings that are mutually locally derivable share a lot of properties ( aperiodicity , repetitivity , pure point diffraction , uniform patch frequency ... ) thus it would suffice to give a local rule that transforms @xmath198 into @xmath68 .",
    "we probably found such a rule , but unfortunately we were yet unable to prove that it really works .",
    "* problem : * are @xmath68 and @xmath198 mutually locally derivable ?    as an intermediate step , one may consider whether @xmath68 is mutually locally derivable with the tiling obtained from @xmath68 by deleting the colours .",
    "it is a simple exercise to see that this is indeed true .",
    "the original construction of inductive rotation tilings found by the second author used to place the origin close to the leftmost part of the patches @xmath51 .",
    "hence the `` limit '' of this sequence fills only a quarter plane .",
    "four copies of this limit could be used to fill the entire plane .",
    "the resulting tilings are the same as the ones described in this paper .",
    "the construction in this paper is more adapted to the notion of convergence of sequences of tilings used here .",
    "here we showed that the tiling @xmath68 is nonperiodic by showing that @xmath68 is a substitution tiling and then applying the result of solomyak that a substitution tiling is nonperiodic if @xmath202 is unique .",
    "we found an alternative proof of nonperiodicity by direct means , using only the limitperiodic structure of @xmath68 .",
    "for the sake of briefness we omit the alternative proof here .",
    "the construction presented here uses squares and rotations by @xmath203 .",
    "the second author found similar constructions for triangles and rotations by @xmath204 as well as for hexagons and rotations by @xmath205 .",
    "for an artistic application of these constructions see http://hofstetterkurt.net/ip , see also @xcite .",
    "the substitution rule @xmath23 used to generate the tiling @xmath68 uses four prototiles , but @xmath206 .",
    "probably one of these tiles is redundant and everything works for a substitution for three prototiles as well .",
    "we prefer to use the four - colour version since it carries more information , so it might make some arguments more clear .",
    "we studied the tilings @xmath68 and @xmath198 .",
    "we have good evidence ( but no proof so far ) that @xmath68 and @xmath198 are mutually locally derivable .",
    "what about other decorations ?",
    "there are decorations of the large square @xmath47 leading to 2-periodic tilings .",
    "so the construction yields at least two distinct mld classes ( one aperiodic , one 2-periodic ) .",
    "are there more mld classes ?",
    "the tilings @xmath198 and @xmath68 are obtained by looking on @xmath89 from `` above '' .",
    "are the tilings obtained by looking from below congruent to @xmath198 respectively @xmath68 ?",
    "are they at least mutually locally derivable with @xmath198 respectively @xmath68 ?",
    "we may realise the sets @xmath89 also with tiles with `` thickness '' in @xmath207 .",
    "now above and below have a precise meaning .",
    "the construction for the sets @xmath89 now has to be described in three dimensions .",
    "is there such a construction such that the height of all @xmath89 is bounded by a common constant ?",
    "are there arbitrary high stairs ?",
    "the second author wants to express his gratitude to the many people from mathematics , art , computer science and textile technology who are supporting the work on inductive rotation tilings , enabling new applications of aperiodic tilings in arts and science .",
