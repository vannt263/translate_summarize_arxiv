    "<S> this minimum occurs when the fermi energy of the tip lines up with the dirac point . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the location of the minimum changes more quickly when the dirac point is near zero tip voltage which is consistent with the linear band structure of graphene . </S>",
    "<S> there is also a dark ridge that occurs at decreasing tip voltage as the gate voltage is increased . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the effect of the voltage on the tip acting as a local gate and changing the density of electrons in the graphene@xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> angle mismatch and the red curve has -10.9@xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> [ fermivelocity ] ]    our local spectroscopy measurements indicate that there is no band gap induced in graphene on hbn , not even locally . </S>",
    "<S> these results disagree with earlier theoretical calculations which predicted the opening of a band gap of order 50 mev when graphene is placed on hbn , because of the breaking of sublattice symmetry@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy is explained by the 1.8% mismatch between the graphene and hbn lattices and the different orientations of the two lattices , which were both neglected in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . taking them into account </S>",
    "<S> , one expects that , while one of the carbon atoms may sit over a boron ( nitrogen ) atom at one location , this alignment gets lost a few lattice constants away . in large enough systems , carbon atoms should therefore have the same probability to have a boron or a nitrogen atom as nearest neighbor in the hbn layer , regardless of their sublattice index . </S>",
    "<S> we numerically checked the validity of this hypothesis by calculating the interlayer hopping potential @xmath13 $ ] from a carbon atom at @xmath14 in the graphene layer to a boron or nitrogen atom at @xmath15 in a rotated hbn layer . </S>",
    "<S> we restricted ourselves to nearest- and next - nearest - neighbor interlayer hopping and chose the parameters @xmath16 ev and @xmath17 nm to fit known values for these hoppings in graphene bilayers@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the 1.8% lattice mismatch alone is sufficient to make the hopping strength from a carbon atom to a boron or a nitrogen atom independent of the graphene sublattice index for systems of a few hundred unit cells , going down to a few tens of unit cells when the lattices are misaligned by about one degree . </S>",
    "<S> we incorporated the fourier transform of this hopping potential into the low - energy hamiltonian for graphene on hbn to find the energy - momentum dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> the inter - layer coupling is nonzero only for @xmath18 as well as for six additional vectors @xmath19 associated with the moir pattern . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , we found that the coupling between the a and b atoms in the graphene lattice with the boron and nitrogen atoms in the hbn are almost identical . </S>",
    "<S> thus sublattice symmetry is restored and a gapless dirac spectrum is recovered , albeit at slightly shifted values of @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fermivelocity]d . </S>",
    "<S> while @xmath21 depends in principle on whether hopping occurs between a carbon and a boron or nitrogen atom , we note that this does not break sublattice symmetry , and we checked that the spectrum remains gapless , even when this discrepancy is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> more details of our numerical approach are given in the supplementary information .    by determining the energy of the dirac point as a function of gate voltage , we can measure the fermi velocity of electrons and holes in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fermivelocity]c shows the energy of the dirac point as a function of gate voltage . </S>",
    "<S> graphene has a linear dispersion relation such that @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the fermi velocity . </S>",
    "<S> since it is a two - dimensional material , the density of electrons is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the spin and valley degeneracy which are both 2 for graphene . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the dirac point should depend on gate voltage as @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the red curve is a fit to the data from which we can extract the fermi velocity . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath28 m / s for the electrons and @xmath29 m / s for the holes . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we observe an asymmetry between the fermi velocity for electrons and holes of about 25% depending on the moir pattern observed . </S>",
    "<S> the shorter moir pattern has a higher fermi velocity for holes while the longer one has a higher fermi velocity for electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of this asymmetry is unclear but may arise due to next - nearest neighbor coupling which are not taken into account in our model .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the main advantages to using hbn as a substrate for graphene as compared to sio@xmath0 is the improvement in electronic properties of the graphene which is believed to be due to the lack of charge traps on the hbn surface . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ spatialmap]a shows the topography of graphene on hbn over a range of 100 nm . </S>",
    "<S> note that the height variation is less than 0.1 nm over the range of the image as compared to typical values of nearly 1 nm for graphene on sio@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we have performed di / dv measurements at 1 nm intervals over the entire area of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ spatialmap]a . for each of these di / dv curves , </S>",
    "<S> we have found tip voltage of the minimum which corresponds to the dirac point . </S>",
    "<S> the results are plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ spatialmap]b . </S>",
    "<S> we have done a similar analysis for a 100 nm area of graphene on sio@xmath0 and the results are plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ spatialmap]c . </S>",
    "<S> the red and blue regions correspond to electron and hole puddles respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear from these two images that the variation in the energy of the dirac point is much smaller on hbn . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial extent of each puddle is also much smaller in the graphene on sio@xmath0 consistent with an increased density of impurities@xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) topography of graphene on hbn . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) tip voltage at the dirac point as a function of position for graphene on hbn . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) tip voltage at the dirac point as a function of position for graphene on sio@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the color scale is the same for ( b ) and ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( d ) histogram of the energies of the dirac point from ( b ) as well as a gaussian fit . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows the same data but also includes the histogram for sio@xmath0 shown in red . </S>",
    "<S> the scale bar in all images is 10 nm . </S>",
    "<S> [ spatialmap ] ]    we can further quantify the disorder in the graphene by looking at a histogram of the energy of the dirac point , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ spatialmap]d . </S>",
    "<S> the main part of the histogram for the dirac point energy on hbn is well fit by a gaussian distribution ( red line ) with a standard deviation of @xmath30 mev . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , there is a small extra bump in the distribution from the hole doped region near the bottom right of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ spatialmap]b . in comparison , </S>",
    "<S> the distribution on sio@xmath0 is much broader with a standard deviation of @xmath31 mev . </S>",
    "<S> these distributions in energy can be converted to charge fluctuations using @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the charge fluctuations in graphene on hbn are @xmath33 @xmath34 while they are more than 100 times larger for graphene on sio@xmath0 , @xmath35 @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> our measurements for the charge fluctuations on sio@xmath0 are consistent with previous single electron transistor@xcite and stm@xcite measurements which established the presence of electron and hole puddles in graphene on sio@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , our measurements for the charge fluctuations in graphene on hbn show a very similar value to values extracted from electrical transport measurements in suspended graphene samples@xcite implying that using hbn as a substrate provides a similar benefit to suspending graphene without the associated fabrication challenges and limitations .    we have demonstrated that graphene on hbn provides an extremely flat surface that has significantly reduced electron - hole puddles as compared to sio@xmath0 . by reducing the charge fluctuations , </S>",
    "<S> the low density regime and the dirac point can be more readily accessed . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , hbn allows this low - density regime to be reached in a substrate - supported system which will allow atomic resolution local probes studies of the dirac point physics . </S>"
