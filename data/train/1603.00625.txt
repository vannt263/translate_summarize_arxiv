    "nearby resolved dwarf galaxies in the local group ( lg ) constitute a compelling sample to address fundamental open questions about galaxy evolution .",
    "the variety of properties in terms of mass , luminosity , surface brightness , gas content , chemical evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , together with the possibility to resolve them into individual stars , offer a large number of observables to investigate how small systems evolved since their formation to the present time .",
    "in particular , the ability to derive quantitative star formation histories ( sfh ) based on deep photometry reaching below the oldest main sequence turn - off ( to , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) allows us to put firm constraints on the time of the onset and of the end of star formation , which opens the possibility to constrain the physical mechanisms directly affecting the early stages of dwarf galaxy evolution .",
    "on the one hand , it is expected that both internal ( supernova feedback , e.g. , @xcite ) and external mechanisms ( e.g. , ionizing photons from the first sources ; @xcite ) affect the star formation activity , terminating it at an early epoch . on the other hand ,",
    "the environment is also expected to play a significant rle on small systems orbiting massive primaries ( tidal stirring : @xcite ; ram pressure : @xcite ; resonances : @xcite ) , which may have a substantial effect in stripping mass from small systems , again leading to an early cessation of the star formation .    in a series of papers , based on deep hst / acs photometry within the framework of the lcid collaboration @xcite",
    ", we have shown that star formation generally continues well past @xmath3 in the mass regime @xmath4 .",
    "however , during the last ten years , our knowledge of the lg has been deeply influenced by photometric surveys that have brought about unexpected discoveries and new questions .",
    "first , the number of known lg galaxies has more than doubled in a few years only . starting with the discovery of the first faint dwarf ( also called  ultra - faint dwarfs ",
    "* ) the known satellites of the milky way ( mw ) jumped from 11 ( 9 bright dsph plus the magellanic clouds ) to 37 today .",
    "these faint dwarfs extend the spectrum of galactic properties to a regime of very low mass , low luminosity , and typically low mean metallicity .",
    "they are thought to have formed stars very early on and for a very short period of time @xcite , possibly because cosmic reionization might have inhibited further star formation in this low mass regime .",
    "all currently known local group faint dwarfs fit well within this general trend , apart from one exception .",
    "leo t , discovered as a stellar over - density in the sloan data release 5 , immediately presented a peculiar combination of low mass ( @xmath5 , @xcite ) and young stellar populations ( @xmath6 200 myr , @xcite ) , together with a large fraction of hi gas @xcite .",
    "deeper hst data confirmed the extended star formation activity from the oldest epochs to the present day ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) , which revives the question of whether cosmic reionization is the actual cause of thee star formation quenching in the faintest dwarfs .",
    "remarkably , two more galaxies recently discovered have stellar mass smaller than that of leo t but their cmd show hints of extended star formation until intermediate epoch : eridanus ii @xcite and hydra ii @xcite , detected in the dark energy survey and in the survey for the magellanic stellar history footprints .",
    "similarly to what occurred in the mw , the number of known satellites of m31 has increased considerably in the last few years @xcite .",
    "this was mainly thanks to the effort of the pandas project @xcite .",
    "the discovery of and xvi was reported in @xcite , from megacam / cfht observations of the m31 surroundings that later would be folded in the pandas survey @xcite . and",
    "xvi is located @xmath7 kpc from m31 in the south - east direction .",
    "the initial estimate of its luminosity ( @xmath8 = -9.2 mag , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggested a relatively bright object .",
    "however , more recent estimates ( martin et al . 2016 , submitted ) revised this value to a significantly fainter value , @xmath8 = 7.6 mag .",
    "first estimates based on the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb ) indicated a distance ( @xmath9)@xmath10=23.60@xmath20.2 mag , corresponding to 525@xmath250 kpc , though smaller values have been suggested ( 23.39@xmath11 , * ? ? ?",
    "spectroscopic follow - up supports a low mean metallicity , close to [ fe / h ] = 2 @xcite .",
    "however , the most distinctive characteristic of and xvi is its extended sfh , which continued to @xmath06 gyr ago @xcite .",
    "the present work is part of the island project ( initial star - formation and lives of the andromeda satellites ) , which obtained a total of 111 hst orbits to study six satellites of m31 ( go 13028 , 13739 ) : and i , and ii , and iii , and xv , and xvi , and and xxviii . in this paper",
    "we present a detailed reanalysis of the data from @xcite , adding information on the properties of the variable stars population and on the spatial variation of the stellar populations .",
    "in particular ,  [ sec : data ] presents a brief summary of the acs data used in this work and a detailed presentation of the and xvi cmd . in  [ sec : vars ] we present the discovery and analysis of rr lyrae ( rrl ) stars , and we derive a new distance for and xvi in  [ sec : distance ] .  [ sec : sfh ] is devoted to the derivation of the detailed sfh , while  [ sec : radial ] presents an analysis of the variation of the properties of and xvi as a function of radius , both in terms of sfh and cmd morphology .",
    "the discussion of these results (  [ sec : discussion ] ) and a summary of the conclusions (  [ sec : conclusions ] ) close the paper .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,>,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : tab03 ]    figure [ fig : sfr_comparison ] presents a comparison between the sfh recovered using different photometry sets and stellar evolution libraries .",
    "in particular , together with the previous daophot+basti solution ( black lines ) , we show the sfh obtained with daophot+girardi ( red lines , @xcite ) and dolphot+basti ( grey lines ) , the figure presents both the sfr as a function of time ( top panel ) as well as the normalized cumulative sfh ( bottom ) .",
    "the plots disclose a general very good agreement .",
    "in particular , the three solutions confirm the fundamental results that the star formation in and xvi did extend to @xmath0 6 gyr ago , and that there is no dominant initial event as in other dsph such as cetus and tucana .",
    "we exclude that this can be an artifact due to photometric errors , as they are too small to affect the to morphology causing the age spread , in either photometry .",
    "moreover , the three solutions confirm an initial star formation followed by a less intense activity .",
    "in particular , the use of either photometry set together with the basti models provide a minimum at 12 gyr , while the subsequent maximum is 1 gyr younger in the dolphot+basti solution than in the daophot+basti one .",
    "interestingly , while the basti solution provides a strong peak at such ages , the solution based on the girardi library is characterized by a flatter sfr , though the age of the peaks agrees very well with the basti solutions .",
    "the consistency between the three solutions is clear in the bottom panels , where the cumulative sfhs agree at the 1-@xmath12 level .    1.38 , left ) and outer regions ( 1.3@xmath13 r@xmath145.00 , right ) of and xvi .",
    "colors symbols show the rrl stars in each region .",
    "the separation between the inner and outer region is such that the two cmds contain the same number of sources within the _ bundles_. two not - too - old isochrones are over - plotted ( z=0.0003 , t=6,8 gyr ) .",
    "the number of stars in the to region comprised by the two curves is large in the inner than in the outer region , suggesting stronger star formation at this age in the closer to the center of the galaxy .",
    ", width=340 ]",
    "in this section we investigate how the properties of and xvi change as a function of the distance from its center .",
    "first , we note that we do not have a symmetric spatial sampling of the galaxy .",
    "in fact , due to a bright field star next to the innermost regions of and xvi , we were forced to point the telescope such that the center of the galaxy is next to the edge of the acs camera , at ( x , y)@xmath15(566,1847 ) px ( see the black cross in figure [ fig : map ] ) .",
    "second , we estimate that the current acs data cover @xmath1523% of the galaxy area .    for the following analysis , we take advantage of a homogeneous derivation of the structural parameters of all m31 dwarf spheroidal galaxies that fall in the pandas footprint @xcite and use the following , updated values for the centroid ( 0:59:30.3 + -0.4;+32:22:34 + -0.4 ) , ellipticity ( 0.29@xmath20.08 ) , position angle ( 98@xmath29 ) , and half - density radius ( 1.0@xmath20.1).we calculated the elliptical distance for each star from the galaxy center , and we used it to select three regions .",
    "the two panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : grad_cmd ] show the cmd of the inner and outer regions , selected such that they have a similar total number of sources _ in the bundles used for the sfh derivation _",
    "( @xmath02,300 ) .",
    "this occurs at r=1.38@xmath16 .",
    "interestingly , the overall morphology of the cmd does not change strongly as a function of radius . in the following we analyze in detail the differences in the sfh , and",
    "how these reflect in the variation of the cmd morphology .",
    "the cdm of the outer regions , already presented in the right panel of figure [ fig : cmd ] , clearly demonstrates that there is marginal evidence for the presence of and xvi stars beyond 5r@xmath17 ( r@xmath18=5.0 ) .      to guide the eye , we over - plotted on figure [ fig : grad_cmd ] two isochrones from the basti database , assuming z=0.0003 and ages= 6,8 gyr . comparing the two panels we found that the region between two curves is slightly more populated in the inner ( 276 stars ) than in the outer region ( 191 stars ) , suggesting that the star formation rate @xmath06 gyr ago was higher in the inner than in the outer region .",
    "it also may indicate that the star formation was slightly more prolonged toward the center of and xvi , as commonly found in nearby dwarf galaxies , though the effect looks small .",
    "it is remarkable that and xvi was able to sustain star formation for at least 6 gyr over a vast fraction of its main body .    to support this finding ,",
    "we derive the sfh in the two elliptical regions , in identical way as for the full galaxy .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : grad_sfh ] , where the calculated sfrs vs time are over - plotted .",
    "the figure shows that the main features are consistent in the inner , outer , and the global solutions .",
    "the sfr in both the central and external region presents an initial peak followed by a decreased activity .",
    "the main peak is recovered at similar age ( @xmath010 gyr ago ) , and star formation continues to 6 gyr in both regions . however , at the most recent epochs , it presents stronger activity in the central part compared to the outskirts , with a secondary peak occurred @xmath07 gyr ago .",
    "it must be stressed that the uncertainties are large , mostly due to the small number of stars used to derive both solutions , and therefore such detailed comparison should be treated cautiously .",
    "however , the fact that and xvi was able to sustain star formation for at least 6 gyr over its entire body remains a solid result .",
    "this is significantly different from what was found in other dwarfs .",
    "for example , the spatial variation of the sfh in lgs 3 and phoenix @xcite indicate the presence of a gradient in the age of the youngest populations , which are confined in the central regions only .",
    "similar conclusions have been reached also in the case of the mw satellites fornax and carina @xcite , which are dominated by intermediate - age populations in the center and by purely old populations in the outskirts .",
    "given its size and luminosity , and xvi is somewhat at the boundary between classical and faint dwarfs .",
    "figure [ fig : relations ] shows the absolute @xmath8 magnitude of local group dwarfs as a function of their size ( half light radius , @xmath16 ) and metallicity .",
    "the data are from the compilation paper by @xcite , and the plots partially replicate his figures 6 and 12 ( see also @xcite , their figure 1 ) .",
    "different symbols indicate lg dwarf galaxies of different morphological types , as labeled .",
    "we updated here the position of and xvi , shown as a black diamond , using the luminosity from martin et al 2016 ( submitted ) . and xvi occupies the faint tail of the m31 satellites sequence , being @xmath01 mag brighter than m31 dwarfs of similar size , such as and xi and and xx .",
    "with respect to previous estimates @xcite , the absolute @xmath8 magnitude increased by @xmath01.7 mag , moving and xvi significantly closer to the faint dwarfs region ( @xmath8 = @xmath197.5 mag ) , but nonetheless it is still @xmath202 - 3 mag brighter than galactic faint dwarfs of similar size such as leo v and ursa major ii .    and",
    "xvi is thus a small mass satellite of m31 , located relatively far from both its host ( @xmath0279 kpc ) and the mw ( @xmath0575 kpc ) .",
    "the most striking feature of its evolution is that it was able to sustain star formation for @xmath07 gyr and , as proven in the previous section , over most of its body , with only a small spatial gradient in the sense that the youngest star formation ( 6 - 8 gyr ago ) was stronger in the inner regions .",
    "this occurrence is an interesting and peculiar feature among lg dwarfs .",
    "in fact , broadly speaking , it is something intermediate between the two typical observed behaviors . following the nomenclature introduced by @xcite",
    ", we identify that the majority of dsph galaxies are _ fast _ systems , i.e. , they have formed stars for a short amount of time at the oldest epochs ( e.g. , draco , ursa minor , cetus , tucana ) . on the other extreme , _ slow",
    "_ dwarf galaxies which present current or recent star formation are characterized by continuous activity from the oldest to youngest epochs ( e.g. , leo a : @xcite ; leo t : @xcite ; ddo210 : @xcite ; the fornax dsph : @xcite ; the magellanic clouds : @xcite ) . within this scheme ,",
    "the dominant old peak of star formation makes and xvi similar to a _ fast _ system , but nonetheless the extended activity is typical of _ slow _ galaxies , though the quenching occurred @xmath0 6 gyr ago .",
    "what mechanisms influenced the evolution of and xvi ?",
    "what favored the extended star formation , and what caused its termination ?",
    "we derived that the mass formed in the surveyed area during the first two gyr is of the order of @xmath21 ( 15% of the total mass ) . therefore , and xvi would have properties comparable to a typical faint dwarf , if star formation had been truncated at a similar epoch .",
    "this suggests that , despite the similar stellar mass back then , and xvi was not strongly affected by reionitazion , which is thought to be the strongest mechanism shutting down star formation in low mass milky way satellites @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the properties of the old population in and xvi are reminiscent of those of the old population in the low - mass dirr isolated galaxies , leo a and leo t , at least in terms of integrated quantities .",
    "on the one hand , the mean star formation rate of leo a between 13.5 and 11.5 gyr ago was @xmath02.@xmath22 , implying that this dirr formed in the first 2 gyr a mass of stars of the order of 4@xmath2310@xmath24 m@xmath25 .",
    "this is within a factor of 2 of what was produced by and xvi2 - 3 , thus not affecting the following discussion ] .",
    "moreover , the number of rrl stars is very similar in both systems ( 8 @xmath26 10 , @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , figure [ fig : relations ] also shows that , in both planes , and xvi is located remarkably close to leo t , the lowest mass star forming galaxy known in the lg .",
    "in particular , and xvi is @xmath200.5 mag fainter than leo t which , despite its low mass ( total mass @xmath27 , @xcite , @xmath28 @xcite , thus comparable to that of and xvi ) , was able to form stars over a hubble time @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the initial properties of and xvi , leo a , and leo t were similar to those of a faint dwarf progenitor . nonetheless , if the initial masses were similar , and xvi , leo t , and leo a would have been equally vulnerable as faint dwarfs to the quenching effect of reionization .",
    "this clearly does not seem to be the case , since in the sfh there is no trace of a strong damping effect during the early evolution , contrary to what occurs in faint dwarfs . _",
    "possibly , this is indicating that the different evolution is dictated by the environmental conditions_. at present , leo t is located in relative isolation quite similar to and xvi , at @xmath0400 kpc from the mw and more than @xmath0900 kpc from m31 .",
    "interestingly , the negative radial velocities of both leo t and and xvi with respect of both spirals and the lg barycenter is compatible with them approaching the lg for the first time .",
    "leo a is remarkably one of the most isolated systems at the fringes of the lg .",
    "together with ddo210 and vv124 it belongs to the restricted group of dwarf galaxies that did not ever strongly interact with either the mw and m31 all along their history @xcite . _",
    "the similarity of and xvi and these dirrs may also indirectly support the idea that and xvi was initially located in a lower density environment , far from both the ionizing radiation and the gravitational effect of the growing mw and m31 , thus explaining the prolonged star formation despite the initial low mass .",
    "this has been proposed to be generally the case for _ slow _",
    "systems @xcite .",
    "_    moreover , it has been suggested that and xvi is among the least dark matter dominated of the m31 satellites @xcite . this as well might be an indication of a slower mass assembling history maybe related to the formation in a low - density environment .",
    "although such small systems are expected to be strongly affected by reionization , the subsequent evolution may be driven by a complex interplay of mass assembly history , effect of the reionization and effect of stellar feedback .",
    "theoretical models by @xcite suggest that the stellar feedback acts as regulator of the evolution of small galaxies after the reionization epoch : in those systems where the star formation started before the reionization , the stellar feedback contributes to sweep out the gas , causing a definitive termination in the star formation . in those systems where no stars formed before the reionization epoch , this contributes to heat up and disperse the gas , but is not strong enough to permanently remove the gas from these systems .",
    "this gas is later recollected by the central halo and can start producing stars mostly at intermediate to young ages .",
    "leo a , leo t and and xvi may fit in this scheme , and therefore they may be galaxies with mass below threshold for star formation before the reionization .",
    "we have presented a detailed analysis of the and xvi dsph galaxy , satellite of m31 , based on deep cmd obtained from acs data .",
    "the main conclusions can be summarized as follows : + @xmath29 we have derived three sfh of and xvi using two different photometric reduction ( daophot and dolphot ) and two stellar evolution libraries ( basti and girardi ) , obtaining a very good agreement independently on the assumptions ; + @xmath29 the sfh of and xvi at the oldest epochs seems different from both the mw and isolated dsph , as the dominant peak occurred relatively late , around 10 gyr ago , is preceded by an initial peak at the oldest ages , followed by a period of decreased activity ; + @xmath29 despite the low stellar mass ( m@xmath010@xmath30m@xmath25 ) , and xvi presents an extended star formation activity , which begun at the oldest epochs and was maintained until @xmath06 gyr ago ; + @xmath29 we detected 9 variable stars , all rrl stars .",
    "eight of them belong to and xvi , while one is compatible with being a more distant , m31 halo field star ; + @xmath29 we provided a new estimate of the distance of and xvi , @xmath1= 23.72@xmath20.09 mag , based on the properties of rrl stars .",
    "we found that different methods ( luminosity - metallicity relation , period - luminosity - metallicity relation ) provide values slightly larger than previous estimates based on the rgb tip ; + @xmath29 we discussed the properties of and xvi in comparison with other lg dwarfs .",
    "and xvi occupies the faint end of the dsph sequence .",
    "however , we found that if its star formation would have been truncated 12 gyr ago , today it would closely resemble a faint dwarf galaxy in stellar mass .",
    "+ @xmath29 the sfh of and xvi is consistent with a formation and early evolution in a low - density environment , which favored a slow mass assembly and prolonged star formation .",
    "a late arrival in the inner region of the lg may have been the cause of the termination in star formation occurring @xmath07 gyr ago .",
    "new data available for more m31 satellites , collected within the framework of this project , will allow us to build a fundamental sample to compare the mw , m31 , and isolated dwarfs in the lg .",
