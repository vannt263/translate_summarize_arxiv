    "flagella constitute the means of propulsion for a large variety of swimming microorganisms and for bio - inspired robots targeted to medical applications @xcite . in eukaryotes these long and flexible appendages",
    "are typically actuated by distributed internal forces .",
    "mammalian spermatozoa , for example , propagate bending waves along their tails to achieve propulsion @xcite .",
    "others , like the bi - flagellate _ chlamydomonas _ , perform a rhythmical breaststroke - like routine leading to a rocketing forward motion @xcite .    on the other hand , passive elastic flagella , when actuated only at one extremity ,",
    "can also constitute a simple but effective swimming device .",
    "a biological example is the bacterium _",
    "e. coli _ ,",
    "whose passive helical tail is actuated at one end by a rotary motor inducing a cork - skew like propulsion @xcite .",
    "locomotion at very small scales is subject to the so called `` scallop theorem '' @xcite , which states that the body of a swimmer must undergo time - irreversible shape changes to produce net advancement .",
    "interestingly , the hydroelastic coupling between a passive elastic filament and the surrounding fluid constitutes , by itself , a source of time - irreversibility .",
    "much has been done on this topic . besides the pioneering work by machin @xcite , the problem has been explored extensively in more recent years . in @xcite wiggins _ et al .",
    "_ demonstrated that , apart from axial rotations , also the planar beating of an elastic filament with one oscillating end can produce axial propulsive force .",
    "these findings have been put in the swimming context by lauga in @xcite , who analysed the locomotion capabilities of an internally actuated swimmer as the one in figure [ fig1](*b * ) .",
    "numerical experiments also focused on externally actuated swimming of microrobots , inspired by the geometry of sperm cells , consisting of a cargo with a clamped passive elastica @xcite like the one depicted in figure [ fig1](*a * ) .",
    "both externally and internally actuated elastic swimmers were also analysed through discrete models by or _",
    "_ in @xcite to grasp the essentials of their motility mechanism .",
    "however , in all the aforementioned studies flagellar beating is always restricted to sinusoidal actuations ; the swimmers move `` head - first '' and , on average , on a straight line .",
    "many questions remain unanswered .",
    "for instance , what is the direction of motion for a generic ( non - sinusoidal ) periodic actuation ? does swimming always take place head - first , or can the sign of swimming velocity be controlled ? in this paper",
    "we provide an answer to these questions .",
    "our analysis is based on a small - compliance assumption as in @xcite , which leads to a simplification of the governing equations and allows for analytic asymptotic approximation . within this limit",
    "we provide explicit formulas whose results are expressed through motility maps @xcite , a visual approach that yields the displacement produced by a given actuation without the need to actually solve the dynamics on a case - by - case basis .",
    "the results of the asymptotic analysis are further validated by the comparison with numerical simulations .",
    "our main finding is the following : modulation in the velocity of actuation can provide a mechanism to select different directions of motion , for both model swimmers .",
    "in particular , a flagellar oscillation composed by a fast down - beat and slow up - beat produces generally a deviation from the symmetry axis around which beating takes place . with these oscillatory inputs , the externally actuated swimmer of figure [ fig1](*a * ) can translate laterally with respect to this symmetry axis , while the internally actuated one of figure [ fig1](*b * ) is able to move along curved trajectories .",
    "moreover , for the externally actuated swimmer , we find a sign reversal in the average velocity for large enough actuation amplitudes .",
    "dependence on the velocity of actuation is not surprising since previous investigations on this kind of model swimmers @xcite reported a non - linear dependence between displacements and frequency of oscillation . with our analysis",
    "we can look deeper into the relations between i ) given ( generic ) actuation , ii ) shape changes of the swimmers , and iii ) displacement after one actuation cycle .",
    "in fact , we demonstrate how the actuation velocity can be considered as a motion control parameter .",
    "take first the internally actuated swimmer . in order to obtain a net displacement",
    ", the swimmer must undergo non - reciprocal shape changes to overcome the scallop theorem . here the shape of the swimmer is determined by the angle @xmath0 between the head and the tail , see figure [ fig1](*b * ) , and by the geometry @xmath1 of the tail itself .",
    "we find that , as a result of the dynamics , @xmath1 depends at first approximation on only two parameters : the internal angle @xmath0 and its velocity @xmath2 .",
    "this last two quantities , then , can be interpreted then as the shape parameters of the swimmer .",
    "non - reciprocal cycles in the shape space @xmath3 , result in different displacements and rotations of the swimmer , and the resulting net motions can be inferred with the aid of the motility maps provided in section [ mm_int ] .    a similar analysis is carried out in section [ ext ] for the swimmer of figure [ fig1](*a * ) . because of the presence of an external torque , in this case the scallop theorem does not apply , see @xcite .",
    "non - reciprocity is , on the other hand , still crucial .",
    "interestingly , in this case the tail geometry is , at first approximation , a standing wave ( i.e. , a fixed function of space multiplied by a time - dependent amplitude ) and it is completely determined by only one parameter : the velocity @xmath4 .",
    "net displacements arise , as a result of external activation , when the angle @xmath5 , see figure [ fig1](*a * ) , and the the geometry of the tail ( which is determined by @xmath4 ) undergo a non - reciprocal cycle .",
    "modulating loops in the space @xmath6 leads to different resulting displacements that can be inferred from the motility maps of section [ mm_ext ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ gov ]",
    "we set up the governing equations for both models , following closely the derivation in @xcite , and we formalize the assumptions on the dynamical parameters . in section [ ext ]",
    "we derive an explicit asymptotic solution for the externally actuated swimmer of figure [ fig1](*a * ) , we derive and comment the motility maps , and we confront the asymptotic solutions with numerical simulations .",
    "a similar analysis is carried out in section [ int ] for the internally actuated swimmer of figure [ fig1](*b * ) .",
    "we consider planar motions of the model swimmers illustrated in figures [ fig1](*a * ) and [ fig1](*b * ) ( although the analysis we present here can be carried out also for fully three dimensional motions ) and we suppose that the plane of locomotion is spanned by two orthonormal vectors @xmath7 .",
    "both models consist of a spherical cargo of radius @xmath8 attached to a passive elastic filament of length @xmath9 , the `` flagellum '' .",
    "both swimmers are surrounded by a newtonian fluid , moving at low reynolds number .        in the case of figure [ fig1](*a * )",
    "the swimmer s flagellum is clamped orthogonally to the cargo , and propulsion is achieved due to an external torque acting on the sphere .",
    "we suppose that such a torque modulates the angle @xmath5 formed by the horizontal line and the line joining the centre of the cargo and the point of attachment .",
    "we define the angle @xmath5 for the swimmer of figure [ fig1](*b * ) in the same way . here , however , we suppose that the flagellum is connected to the sphere by a joint , and that the relative angle @xmath0 between the flagellum and the cargo at the point of attachment can vary , under the action of an internal torque .    in both cases the elastic flagellum",
    "is supposed to be inextensible and slender , that is @xmath10 where @xmath11 the radius of its cross - section .",
    "as in @xcite we model the dynamics of interaction between the fluid and such a slender filament using `` resistive force theory '' . the relationship between forces and velocities is local , and the viscous drag coefficients @xmath12 and @xmath13 are , respectively , the force exerted by the fluid per unit length of the flagellum for motion parallel and perpendicular to its length . for classical reviews on resistive force theory",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "we neglect here hydrodynamic interactions between flagellum and cargo .",
    "the interaction between the fluid and the cargo is given by classical stokes drag formulas .",
    "the mass of the swimmers is also neglected as viscous and elastic forces dominate the dynamics .",
    "our analysis relies on yet another hypothesis , previously stated in the introduction : we assume that the flagellum ( in both cases ) has a large bending resistance compared with the viscous forces applied to it .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath14 is the bending stiffness of the flagellum and @xmath15 the frequency of actuation ( either internal or external ) , then we assume that the ratio between the typical normal viscous force @xmath16 and the typical elastic force @xmath17 acting on the flagellum @xmath18 is small . as a consequence ,",
    "the flagellum does not deviate much from a straight line . in view of this",
    ", we take as resistive drag coefficients the ones calculated for straight slender bodies in @xcite , that is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid , while @xmath21 and @xmath22 are constant of the order @xmath23 depending on the cross - sectional shape of the flagellum . in the following",
    "we shall refer to @xmath24 as the `` machin number '' and always assume @xmath25 assumption is satisfied , for example , for a magnetic permalloy flagellum with @xmath26 and young modulus @xmath27 , as in @xcite .",
    "indeed , if we consider such a flagellum beating in water @xmath28 , using the formula @xmath29 we have @xmath30 which satisfies for a reasonable range of frequencies .",
    "we point out that this is not the case for all flagellar swimmers of interest : for the artificial swimmer in @xcite @xmath31 , while for sperm cells @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion for our systems have been derived already in previous investigations , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite . to write them in non - dimensional form",
    "we scale the space variables by @xmath9 , forces by @xmath17 , moments by @xmath33 , and time @xmath34 by @xmath35 .",
    "the balance of viscous and elastic forces on the flagellum , for both the externally and the internally actuated case , gives @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the arc - length parametrized curve ( on the plane ) describing the position of the flagellum , and @xmath38 is the viscous anisotropy ratio .",
    "equation is accompanied by that for the lagrange multiplier @xmath39 imposing the inextensibility condition @xmath40 , see @xcite .",
    "we omit here this equation since @xmath41 will drop out from the equations governing the dynamics thanks to the approximations we make in the following .",
    "the ( normalized ) elastic force @xmath42 and the elastic moment @xmath43 are given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the unit vector normal to the plane of locomotion and @xmath46 is the curvature of @xmath47 .",
    "at the free end ( @xmath48 ) we assume that no forces or torques are acting on the flagellum , thus @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the force balance for the cargo , for both the externally and the internally actuated case , reads @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the ( normalized ) coordinate of the centre point of the cargo and @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the normalized radius of the cargo . for the externally actuated swimmer",
    "the balance of moments ( with respect to @xmath52 ) for the cargo gives @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the ( normalized ) external torque acting on the cargo and @xmath57 for the internally actuated swimmer the moment balance reads @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the ( normalized ) internal torque acting on the flagellum modulating the angle difference @xmath0 .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , we restrict our analysis to the case in which the flagellum bends mildly away from a straight moving reference axis ( the dotted line in figures [ fig1](*a * ) and [ fig1](*b * ) ) .",
    "we assume that the direction of the reference axis is given at time @xmath34 by the normal vector @xmath60 where @xmath61 in the externally actuated case and @xmath62 in the internally actuated one .",
    "following @xcite , we represent the curve @xmath47 as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the unit vector orthogonal to the reference axis .",
    "we suppose @xmath65 so that , in particular , the orientation of the flagellum at the point of attachment is determined by @xmath66 . moreover , we assume the scalar function @xmath1 to be small , along with all its derivatives .",
    "in fact , as we can validate a - posteriori , @xmath1 and its derivatives can be assumed to be of order @xmath67 . in this regime",
    "the variable @xmath68 can be considered as the arc - length coordinate of the curve @xmath47 , instead of @xmath69 . using the approximation",
    "@xmath70 we obtain @xmath71 therefore we can write @xmath72 the boundary conditions at the free edge ( @xmath73 ) read then @xmath74 while , projecting on @xmath75 and @xmath76 , we have @xmath77 the moment balance for the cargo for the externally actuated swimmer becomes @xmath78 while for the internally actuated swimmer we have @xmath79 finally , we rewrite the force balance equations on the flagellum with @xmath47 given by .",
    "notice first that @xmath80 where @xmath81 using and we express the left hand side of equation in terms of @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath66 , and @xmath1 .",
    "we make here a simplification : we drop terms of this expression involving powers of @xmath1 and its derivatives , as they are negligible within our small bending assumption . projecting on @xmath75 and @xmath76",
    "we obtain    align & ( ( u^x - y ) + ( -1 ) ( u^y + x ) ) = [ flag1 ] + & ( u^y + x + + ( - 1)u^x ) = - + ( ) [ flag2 ]    in sections [ ext ] and [ int ] , further simplifications of these equations are derived .",
    "we end this section with a comment .",
    "the simplification scheme we adopted here follows very closely the one proposed in @xcite . in @xcite , however , small bendings of the flagellum come from the hypothesis of small actuation amplitude , while here they arise as a consequence of small compliance . while the orientation of the axis of reference ( the dotted line in figures [ fig1](*a * ) and [ fig1](*b * ) ) of the flagellum is considered fixed in @xcite , here we allow large amplitude oscillations of this axis .",
    "moreover , we drive our system with periodic yet generic inputs , while only sinusoidal actuations are considered in @xcite .",
    "the natural problem for the externally actuated swimmer is that of finding the motion given the external actuation torque @xmath84 .",
    "we study here first the problem in which @xmath5 is given rather than @xmath84 , for two reasons : first , it simplifies the asymptotic calculations ; second , the mechanism generating propulsion is better understood when treated in terms of the configurational parameter @xmath5 .",
    "observe that , in this case , the moment balance equation is only used a - posteriori , to determine the external torque @xmath85 needed to impose the prescribed oscillations of @xmath5 .",
    "we first simplify further the system of equations . as mentioned in the previous section",
    ", we can assume that @xmath1 and its derivatives are of order @xmath67 .",
    "in addition , since @xmath61 , from , , and we have @xmath86 which implies @xmath87 , and therefore @xmath88 . the terms multiplied by @xmath82 and @xmath41 in are of order @xmath89 , and can be dropped from the equation . the transversal force balance on the flagellum then reads @xmath90 notice that the variables @xmath1 and @xmath41 are now decoupled . integrating @xmath41 from and using definitions",

    "the system is solved numerically with a finite difference scheme , based on the one proposed in @xcite . here , and in all the numerical simulations presented in the paper , we take @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .    in the next section",
    "we derive a perturbation scheme to obtain a formal asymptotic solution for the system of equations . in section [ mm_ext ]",
    "we compare numerical solutions and analytical approximations , and we discuss physical interpretations of the results .",
    "we now proceed formally in finding an asymptotic solution of our problem , applying standard perturbation techniques .",
    "we look for solutions in the form of a power series in the machin number @xmath97 for @xmath5 we take @xmath98 , where @xmath99 and @xmath100 for @xmath101 . substituting these expression in - and expanding all members of the equations in power series of @xmath24 , we equate coefficients of like powers of @xmath24 .",
    "we obtain a series of equations to be solved successively .",
    "equation becomes @xmath102 for @xmath101 , while gives @xmath103 for @xmath101 .",
    "these equations come with the following boundary conditions @xmath104 notice that @xmath82 is completely decoupled from @xmath83 and @xmath1 , as it appears only in",
    ". we can then solve ( formally ) for @xmath83 and @xmath1 from and , and subsequently recover the asymptotic expression for @xmath82 though the equality .",
    "observe also that equations come from the expansion of an equation in which the only derivative with respect to time is multiplied by @xmath24 . as a consequence",
    ", we can not impose the initial condition @xmath93 on the asymptotic solution of @xmath1 .",
    "this is a well known aspect of this kind of perturbation schemes , in which solutions approximate the unperturbed ones apart from an initial `` boundary layer '' .    in the following",
    "we calculate explicitly the asymptotic solution up to order @xmath105 .",
    "clearly , at order zero we must have @xmath106 equation for @xmath105 then reads @xmath107 the unique solution for @xmath108 satisfying the previous equation and the boundary conditions can be written as @xmath109 substituting in we have @xmath110 which gives @xmath111 plugging the above expression for @xmath112 back in we obtain @xmath113 is a polynomial in @xmath68 whose coefficients can be calculated explicitly .",
    "notice that , at leading order , the shape of the flagellum @xmath114 is completely determined by the actuation _",
    "this is not entirely surprising , since the bending of the flagellum must be proportional to the total moment applied to it , which itself depends on the velocity of the swimmer .",
    "we will return on this observation in the next section .",
    "we now find an explicit solution for @xmath116 by considering the @xmath117 order problem in , which reads @xmath118 following the same arguments as in the case of @xmath108 we obtain the integral formula @xmath119 which , substituted in for @xmath117 , gives @xmath120 from the above equation we have @xmath121 we can now find the solution for the first orders of @xmath82 . if we replace the asymptotic expansion of @xmath1 in we get @xmath122 from which we obtain the expressions for the orders @xmath123 and @xmath105 of the @xmath82 asymptotic expansion @xmath124      we now consider the motion of the swimmer given a ( generic ) periodic actuation @xmath5 .",
    "the resulting trajectories of the coordinate @xmath52 of the cargo are obtained by integrating the expression @xmath125 where @xmath91 and @xmath83 are either the numerical or the asymptotic solutions of - .",
    "notice that , if @xmath5 is periodic , then the approximated asymptotic solutions for @xmath82 and @xmath83 are also periodic .",
    "numerical solutions of - , while depending on the initial condition @xmath93 , converge after very few oscillations ( @xmath126 for most simulations ) to a periodic orbit which turn out to be independent from @xmath93 .",
    "asymptotic solutions provide a good approximation of numerical solutions past this short time transient .",
    "this is the time range to which we restrict our analysis in the following .",
    "an important consequence of the periodicity of solutions is that , since @xmath82 and @xmath83 converge to periodic functions , implies that @xmath127 is also periodic .",
    "if we consider the net displacement of the cargo after the @xmath128 period @xmath129 , then @xmath130 for every @xmath131 and @xmath132",
    ". the definition of @xmath133 is well posed , and it gives the net displacement of the cargo after _ any _ period of the actuation .",
    "the displacement @xmath133 is the main focus of this section .    without loss of generality",
    "we can restrict our analysis to the case in which the angle @xmath5 oscillates around @xmath134 ( i.e. the flagellum is beating around the horizontal axis ) . as it is intuitive",
    ", an oscillation about a given angle produces the same kinematics of swimming , up to a rotation , as when the same oscillation is performed about the horizontal .",
    "we discuss first the asymptotic solution of , based on the results we obtained in the previous section .",
    "we expand @xmath127 into a power series in the machin number up to the first order @xmath135 . from , ,",
    "and we have @xmath136 from this expansion we obtain a formula for the displacement @xmath137 . at order zero",
    "we have @xmath138 notice that @xmath139 can be seen as the trajectory of a swimmer with a rigid straight flagellum , since for @xmath140 equations - describe precisely this system .",
    "equation then says that a rigid swimmer , whose periodic orientation is controlled externally , always undergoes reciprocal motions , and it is incapable of net advancements .",
    "now , the equation for @xmath141 in has the following form @xmath142 where @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "it can be easily shown that the right hand side of gives , in general , a non - zero result when integrated over one period of @xmath5 .",

    "we show some examples of this estimating procedure , illustrating motility maps for different actuations .",

    "the projection @xmath167 is an odd function of the variable @xmath5 .",

    "the authors analyse a two - link swimmer with a passive elastic joint .",
    "they conclude that , to achieve propulsion , the orientation of one arm of the swimmer and the internal angle between the links ( the `` shape '' of the swimmer ) must undergo non - reciprocal cycles , thus breaking the time - reversibility of the interaction with the stokes fluid . focusing on sinusoidal oscillations ,",
    "they demonstrate that the elastic joint `` makes it happen '' .",
    "in fact , the competition between elastic restoring forces and viscous drag generates a phase lag in the shape response , and hence non - reciprocal motion .",
    "the exact same mechanism holds for our swimmer , as we can deduce from formula . as we mentioned in section [ asym_ext ] , at leading order the bending of the flagellum @xmath176 is fully described by the angle velocity .",
    "this is because of the forces bending the flagellum are of viscous nature , hence proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "formula tells , in particular , that we have a finite displacement , at least at leading order , only if the measure of the set @xmath148 is non - zero : that is , only if @xmath5 and @xmath4 , and therefore the orientation @xmath5 and the `` shape '' @xmath1 , undergo non - reciprocal cycles .",
    "a sinusoidal actuation leads to @xmath5 and @xmath4 out of phase and it is sufficient to produce locomotion along the symmetry axis of beating .",
    "however , we show that not only the model _ can _ swim , but the actuation velocity @xmath4 can be as well used as a control parameter to obtain lateral motion with respect to this axis .    we can push this analogy further , by putting our results in the context of geometric control theory @xcite .",
    "indeed , problems of motion control arising in different fields such as wheeled robot locomotion @xcite and crawling @xcite all lead to systems of equations similar to .",

    "our model lies within this general framework , with @xmath183 , and one major peculiarity . unlike all the aforementioned studies , here",
    "the control parameters can not be chosen independently .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath184 , since @xmath150 .",
    "however , the key requirement for obtaining a net motion is not the independence of controls , but rather their non - reciprocal evolution .",
    "since the controls one the time derivative of the other , non - reciprocity happens `` naturally '' .",
    "the simple actuations considered before are an example of that .",
