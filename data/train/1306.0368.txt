    "it is still not clear , whether massive stars form preferentially by accretion of material through a circumstellar disk or by coagulation of lower mass stars in a multiple system .",
    "maybe , both ways of formation are possible , then it is still unknown , how often each of the two channels is chosen by nature .",
    "high and intermediate mass stars very often are multiple with a binary fraction of 70 to 90 % . yet , for many high and intermediate mass stars , no deep and sensitive multiplicity survey has been done . in particular , only few of these stars have been observed so far by ao imagers , which can find very faint , maybe sub - stellar , companions also at a separation range ( roughly 0.1 to few arc sec , i.e. long orbital periods ) , which is not reachable for spectroscopic surveys ( short periods ) .",
    "this object is part of our study of multiplicity of b - type stars in european southern observatory ( eso ) archival adaptive optics ( ao ) imaging data . with this project we can study the statistical aspects of multiplicity among intermediate mass stars ,",

    "@xcite identified hr3672 as a possible member of the open cluster hip45189 ( no probability of membership given ) with an age of @xmath11 ( for details , see secion[mass_age_a ] ) .",
    "the spectral type of hr3672 is b6iv according to simbad , but as reported in the literature by different authors ( and summarized e.g. by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , mainly yielded spectral types between b4v and b7v ( see sec.[spec_class ] and sec.[mass_age_a ] ) . the star is also suspected to be variable with an amplitude in v of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "+ we also use this object exemplary to introduce an alternative method for the astrometric calibration ( self - calibration of pixel scale and detector orientation ) of data by using the science images instead of extra recorded calibration binaries or clusters .",
    "+ the order of this paper is as follows . in sec.[obs ] the observations and data reduction are presented .",
    "a detailed description of the self - calibration for astrometry is given in sec.[calib ] .",
