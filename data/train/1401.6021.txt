    "this is exemplified by the content of the so called scallop theorem : a sequence of deformations in the body of a microswimmer will lead to the same displacement , irrespective of the speed at which each deformation is carried on .",
    "a `` microscopic scallop '' could not propel itself by quickly closing its valves , and then slowly opening them up to recover its initial configuration @xcite . in order for propulsion to be achieved",

    "progress in the field of nanotechnology has opened the way to the possible realization of artificial microswimmers @xcite .",
    "one of the issues that will have to be solved is clearly that of the energy supply .",
    "this entails the optimization problem of finding the minimum energy strategy to propel the swimmer at the given velocity . over the years",

    "most of the effort has been directed to the study of `` deterministic '' microswimmers @xcite .",
    "if the microswimmer is sufficiently small , however , thermal fluctuations will start to play a role , and the optimization problem will turn from deterministic to stochastic @xcite .",
    "this aspect is of relevance to the new field of nanometer - scale swimming , in which propulsion is achieved by chemical unbalance in the environment , or on the surface of the nanodevice @xcite . on the other hand , noise is expected to play a role also at larger scales , as the molecular motors responsible for propulsion , in a microswimmer , work in and out of equilibrium condition , and are likely to be characterized by fluctuations of larger amplitude than in thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the presence of noise will affect the swimmer performance in several ways .",
    "noise will induce a random component in the swimming strokes , and therefore , also in the migration velocity @xcite . to this ,",
    "global diffusion induced by thermal noise in the fluid , must be added .",
    "an optimal design is likely to require some minimization of these effects . at the same time",
    ", noise is likely to contribute to the energetics of the process . here , things become less clear : it is well known that there are situations in which noise can play a constructive role .",
    "most molecular motors , indeed , exploit thermal noise in some way or another to improve their efficiency @xcite .",
    "this is precisely the question we want to ask : can thermal noise be exploited to improve the swimmer efficiency , and do part of the job of pushing the device along its desired path ?",
    "the answer is yes , and we shall see that minimal dissipation , for given values of the mean swimming velocity , and of the swimming stroke amplitude , is achieved in correspondence to a minimum of the swimming velocity fluctuation . this does not correspond to a minimum of the random component in the swimming strokes , rather , it is realized through optimal control of their correlations .",
    "we shall discuss the nature of the internal forces in the swimmer that can produce this result .    to study the problem , we shall consider a swimmer design that has received much attention recently , namely , an ensemble of three identical spherical beads connected by extendable links that do not interact with the fluid @xcite .",
    "models in this class have been utilized to elucidate the properties both of individual swimmers @xcite and ensemble of swimmers @xcite , and have found experimental realization , with optical tweezers used to drive the beads @xcite .    in order to proceed , we shall make a number of simplifying assumption on the structure of the swimmer , on the stroke amplitude and on the nature of the fluctuations .",
    "we shall assume that the swimmer moving parts and the stroke amplitude are small on the scale of the swimmer body , and that the dynamics of the system is slow .",
    "the first two assumptions allow a quasilinear description of the dynamics , in which the feedback of the fluid perturbation on the swimmer dynamics , is disregarded .",
    "this corresponds to the lowest order in the description based on the kirkwood - smoluchowski equation , utilized in @xcite .",
    "the last assumption of slow dynamics guarantees that the response of the system to the deformation forces obey standard steady - state fluctuation - dissipation relations .",
