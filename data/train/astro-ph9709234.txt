    "on scales of 510 arcseconds ( @xmath18 kpc ) , the optical morphology is complicated by prominent dust lanes , and several distinct regions of strong emission , the two most prominent of which ( along a north - southwest line ) are separated by @xmath19 arcsec ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the relatively low astrometric precision of hst ( @xmath20 arcsec ) precludes accurate registration with our other data sets . nor is it possible to accurately match strong features in the optical and nir , probably because the optical data are much more severely confused by patchy dust extinction .",
    "the morphology of the central kpc region of mrk  273 is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the three dominant sources of emission have been labeled n ( north ) , se ( southeast ) , and sw .",
    "component n is the brightest radio and nir peak .",

    "at 50 mas resolution ( 5 ghz , fig .",

    "is resolved into two peaks , which we call ne ( east ) and nw ( west ) ( fig .",
    "these `` twin peaks '' are separated by @xmath0 mas ( @xmath1570 pc ) spatially ( fig .  3 ,",
    "the signal to noise ratio of the twin peaks gives a positional accuracy of a few mas , so they are a robust detection .",
    "the @xmath8 image also shows a double - peaked feature ( inset in fig .",
    "3 ) , at the same position but with a slightly different ( @xmath21 ) position angle .",
    "this double @xmath8-peak has been confirmed in a keck image ( e.ye .",
    "khachikian , private communication ) .",
    "component se is a strong radio continuum source ( condon et al .",
    "we detect it clearly in our two independent merlin data sets , but it has no counterpart in nir or optical images ( figs .  1 , 2 , 3 ) .",
    "we do not confirm the tentative detection at 2.2 @xmath10 m by majewski et al .",
    "3 shows that at 50 mas resolution component se is resolved into a strong , peaked , component with two separate regions of emission at 4@xmath22 level .",
    "component sw is the second strong nir source , almost 1 arcsec ( 700 pc ) southwest of the main emission region , n. it may have a counterpart in the optical image , possibly distorted or displaced due to the effects of dust extinction , but the astrometry of the optical image is not accurate enough to confirm this .",
    "component sw is extended and relatively weak in both the 5 ghz ( fig .  2 ) and 8.4 ghz maps ( fig .  1 of condon et al .",
    "peak and integrated radio fluxes for the different components are shown in table  1 , and radio positions and @xmath8-band magnitudes and luminosities in table  2 .",
    "we have determined spectral indices from our combined radio continuum images , and confirmed these with direct derivations from the peak fluxes . comparing the 1.6 and 5 ghz images , both at 150 mas resolution , gives a spectral index ( @xmath23 ; @xmath24 ) for the twin peaks area in component n of @xmath25 ( ne and nw are not resolved at 150 mas ) .",
    "the surrounding emission has a significantly different spectral index of @xmath260.7 @xmath16 0.1 ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "the radio spectral index of component se is @xmath261.0 @xmath16 0.2 .",
    "the diffuse radio emission detected at 1.6 , 5 and 8.4 ghz for component sw has a spectral index of @xmath27 .",
    "the flat spectrum in the twin peaks region in component n suggests that it may be the compact synchrotron core of a seyfert radio source .",
    "this is consistent with n being the strongest radio and nir component .",
    "a flat spectrum would also be expected if the radio emission is dominated by nebular free - free emission , the strongest source of which is likely to be the seyfert narrow line region . taking the h@xmath28 flux measured by koski ( 1978 ) and correcting it for the extinction ( @xmath29 mag ) inferred from the balmer decrement , we estimate that for a typical nebular temperature of @xmath30k , the free - free continuum emitted by the narrow line region can contribute at most 1% of the measured 5ghz flux density of component n. if a dusty molecular torus is present ( as we suggest in section 5 ) , another possibility is that some fraction of the observed radio flux is due to free - free continuum emission from a hidden emission line region .",
    "however , it is unlikely that all of the radio emission from component n can be explained in this way , since the corresponding h@xmath28 luminosity ( @xmath31ergs@xmath5 ) would suggest a quasar broad - line region and such a source would be unresolved at the spatial resolution of our radio maps .",
    "the spectral index of the emission surrounding the twin peaks is significantly steeper ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "given the morphology of this region , the radio emission may trace supernova remnants in regions of star formation around the agn , at a radius of a few hundred pc .",
    "the origin of both components se and sw is unclear .",
    "se was interpreted by condon et al .",
    "( 1991 ) as the nucleus of a merging galaxy .",
    "however , given the absence of an nir or optical counterpart and its negative spectral index , which suggests optically thin synchrotron emission , component se may well be a background source , presumably a distant radio galaxy .    the flat spectrum and diffuse morphology of the relatively weak radio source corresponding to component sw suggests optically thin free - free emission .",
    "the integrated 8.44ghz flux density would then imply an h@xmath28 flux comparable with that measured by koski ( 1978 ) .",
    "it is plausible , therefore , that component sw is the site of a starburst triggered by the merger , with the observed radio flux arising as free - free emission from the associated  regions .",
    "one might then expect the emission line spectrum to exhibit a mixture of seyfert and starburst characteristics , but the hst image ( fig .",
    "1 ) suggests that component sw is at least partially obscured and hence line emission from the starburst may suffer heavy extinction .",
    "indeed , while there is little evidence for spectral features related to star formation in the optical spectrum , such features do become apparent in the nir ( goldader et al .",
    "we have combined state - of - the - art radio , nir and optical imaging observations , all at resolutions of around 150 mas , to study the nuclear region of the ulirg mrk273 .",
    "our images have revealed three main radio components , two of which , n and sw , have bright nir counterparts .",
    "small - scale ( @xmath32mas ) structure is also present in component n and , possibly , se .",
    "mrk 273 has a double nucleus which is detected at both nir and radio wavelengths and whose components ( n and sw ) are separated by @xmath33 arcsec , supporting the hypothesis that this system formed in a recent merger .",
    "condon et al .",
    "( 1991 ) reached a similar conclusion on the basis of their radio data , but identified radio components n and se as the double nucleus .",
    "the lack of a nir counterpart to component se , however , suggests that it is in fact a background source unrelated to mrk  273 .",
    "component n is probably the site of the active galactic nucleus which produces the seyfert 2 emission line spectrum : it is the brightest source at both radio and ir wavelengths , and the radio continuum , which has a flat spectral index consistent with a compact synchrotron source , is too strong to be attributed to nebular free - free emission . at a resolution of 50 mas ,",
    "the radio source within component n resolves into a twin - peaked structure whose `` lobes '' are separated by @xmath34 mas ( @xmath35pc ) .",
    "a similar double structure is detected in our @xmath8-band image .",
    "the two peaks ne and nw could represent distinct merger remnants each harbouring a compact synchroton radio source .",
    "@xmath8 magnitudes for components n and sw , and even ne and nw ( table  2 ) , are consistent with those of bright galactic nuclei ( e.g. , forbes et al .",
    "however , we suggest the alternative interpretation that the double nir structure is actually an artifact of obscuration by an edge - on dusty molecular torus .",
    "the corresponding radio structure can then be explained as a compact double - lobed radio source similar to those present in other seyfert galaxies , which is fed by synchrotron - emitting plasma ejected from the ( hidden ) active nucleus . the presence and orientation of the torus should be confirmed by forthcoming merlin observations of the oh megamaser emission associated with mrk  273 .",
    "the radio flux from component sw is relatively weak and can plausibly be attributed to nebular free - free emission .",
    "this leads us to propose that component sw harbors a heavily obscured starburst which may have been triggered by the merger .",
