    "is established which is characterized by time - independent macroscopic properties , provided a suitable reference frame is chosen .",
    "generically , detailed balance is broken by the incident particle flux @xcite , so that this steady state can not be described by a boltzmann distribution ; instead , its statistical properties have to be determined directly from its dynamical evolution . if one is primarily interested in universal , large scale , long time characteristics , the dynamical evolution can often be cast as a langevin equation which can be analyzed using techniques from renormalized field theory .    here , we extend a model @xcite due to marsili _ et al .",

    "requires the addition of a stochastic term to the growth equation .",
    "since the particle beam selects a preferred ( `` parallel '' ) direction in the substrate plane , the resulting langevin equation is necessarily anisotropic .",
    "the interplay of interatomic interactions and kinetic effects , such as schwoebel barriers , generates an anisotropic effective surface tension which can become very small or even vanish . due to the anisotropy ,",
    "this leads to four different regimes with potentially scale - invariant behaviors .",
    "we analyze these four regimes , identify the scale - invariant ones , and compute the associated anisotropic roughness exponents .",
    "models with oblique particle incidence have been investigated previously .",
    "focusing on vapor - deposited thin films , meakin and krug @xcite considered the ballistic deposition of particles under near - grazing incidence . under these conditions , columnar patterns form which shield parts of the growing surface from incoming particles .",
    "the large scale properties of these structures can be characterized in terms of anisotropic scaling exponents , differentiating parallel and transverse directions @xcite .",
    "following marsili et al.@xcite , our model differs from krug and meakin s approach in two important respects .",
    "first , surface overhangs and shadowing effects are neglected so that our results are restricted to near - normal incidence .",
    "second , our model is designed for `` ideal mbe''-type growth so that it falls outside the kardar - parisi - zhang universality class @xcite for mass non - conserving growth .",
    "however , extending the work of marsili _ et al _ @xcite , we include a possibly anisotropic _ effective _ surface tension and investigate its effects systematically ( see further comments in the following section ) .",
    "due to the anisotropy , this contribution actually consists of two terms , one controlling relaxation parallel and the other transverse to the beam direction , with coupling constants @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively . depending on which of these two couplings , @xmath0 or @xmath1 , vanishes first , ripple - like surface structures are expected , aligned transverse to the soft direction .",
    "the roughness properties near these two instabilities , characterized respectively by @xmath2 while @xmath3 , and @xmath4 while @xmath5 , are discussed in this paper for the first time .",
    "the original theory of marsili _ _ et al__@xcite is recovered only if both couplings , @xmath0 _ and _ @xmath1 , vanish simultaneously . since the latter requires the careful tuning of _ two _ parameters , it is much less likely to be experimentally relevant than either of the other two instabilities in which only a _",
    "parameter must be adjusted . referring all technical details to a separate publication @xcite",
    ", we will point out very briefly that the fixed point and the roughness exponents reported in marsili _ _ et al__@xcite must be significantly revised .",
    "an important aspect discussed in this article is how to translate surface data into roughness exponents , for inherently anisotropic surface models such as the one analyzed here . if we generalize the standard definitions familiar from isotropic problems , we arrive at _ four different _ roughness exponents .",
    "@xcite two of these characterize real - space scans along and transverse to the beam direction , and the remaining two are needed to describe scattering ( i.e. momentum space ) data with parallel or transverse momentum transfer .",
    "all four are related by simple scaling laws , but possess distinct numerical values . when analyzing experimental data , it is therefore essential to be aware of these subtleties .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first present the underlying langevin equation for a single - valued height field and briefly review the physical origin of its constituents .",
    "we then present a careful definition of the roughness exponents , based on height - height correlation functions and their structure factors . turning to the renormalization group ( rg ) analysis",
    ", we first discuss a simple scaling symmetry of our model which allows us to identify a set of effective coupling constants .",
    "the invariance of our model with respect to _ tilts _ of the surface is much more powerful .",
    "since this symmetry is continuous , it gives rise to a ward identity which relates different vertex functions .",
    "this simplifies the renormalization procedure considerably .",
    "we then present our main results for the scaling properties of correlation and response functions for the four different cases : ( o ) both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are positive ; ( i ) @xmath0 remains positive while @xmath1 vanishes ; ( ii ) @xmath0 vanishes while @xmath1 remains positive ; and finally , ( iii ) both @xmath0 and @xmath1 vanish simultaneously .",
    "roughness and dynamic critical exponents are derived .",

    "nevertheless , we still obtain testable predictions for this case , namely , the general scaling form of the height - height correlations as well as the scaling laws relating different exponents .    needless to say , in the absence of an infrared stable fixed point , the renormalization group gives us no information about possible roughness exponents for case ( ii )  ( @xmath42 , @xmath44 ) .",
    "in fact , if the scenario of a first order transition line applies , the whole concept of scaling exponents would be misplaced .",
    "to summarize , we have analyzed the long - time , large distance scaling properties of a surface growing under ideal mbe - type conditions , subject to an incident particle beam tilted away from the surface normal .",
    "this selects a particular ( `` parallel '' )  direction in the substrate plane , so that the resulting growth equations for the ( single - valued ) height field are spatially anisotropic .",
    "in particular , an _ effective _ surface tension becomes anisotropic , contributing the terms @xmath237 to the right hand side of the langevin equation .",
    "if both of these parameters , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , are positive , the surface is described by the edwards - wilkinson model . however , depending on experimental control parameters such as temperature , incident flux rate and angle , or particle size , either @xmath27 or @xmath28 or both can vanish , generating significantly different surface properties .",
    "each of these three possibilities leads to a distinct field theory with different upper critical dimension .",
    "we find @xmath138 if @xmath43 at finite @xmath27 , @xmath155 if @xmath44 at finite @xmath28 , and @xmath163 if both vanish . only the first and the third case lead to scale - invariant behavior ; the second one may in fact trigger a first - order phase transition whose properties lie outside the scope of our rg techniques . focusing on the first and third case , we find two distinct , novel surface universality classes . for both ,",
    "we compute the scaling behavior of the two - point height - height correlation function and carefully extract four different roughness exponents .",
    "two of these characterize the height fluctuations of the surface in real space , scanned either along the parallel or the transverse directions ; the remaining two characterize scattering data with momentum transfer either along the parallel or the transverse directions . when analyzing experimental data , care must be taken in identifying the correct exponent .",
    "clearly , the third case requires the careful tuning of two parameters , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "if we can substantiate the presence of a first - order line for @xmath44 at finite @xmath238 , the point @xmath239 would in fact be a critical endpoint , since it separates a line of second order transitions from a line of first order ones . in order to access it in a typical experiment ,",
    "at least two control parameters have to be tuned very carefully , making it difficult to observe .",
    "for this reason , either the second or the first order lines should be more accessible experimentally . from the rg perspective ,",
    "even if @xmath27 is set to zero initially , it will be generated under rg transformations , resulting in a non - zero value ; this is not the case for the @xmath240 contribution . in that sense , we believe that the most physically relevant theory ( apart from edwards - wilkinson behavior ) is the one with @xmath41 and @xmath241 . amongst our key results for this model are the roughness exponents for real - space surface scans . for the physically most interesting case of a two - dimensional surface , we find @xmath228 if the fluctuations are measured along the transverse direction , and @xmath242 for scans along the parallel direction .",
    "while the value for @xmath61 may be modified by higher - order contributions in perturbation theory , the result for @xmath243 is exact .",
    "finally , we turn to possible experimental evidence for these exponents .",
    "thin films of vapor - deposited gold on smooth glass surfaces @xcite were previously proposed @xcite as possible realizations of our theory .",
    "the deposit surfaces were imaged by scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) , and their mean - square width was measured as a function of stm  scan length , resulting in a roughness exponent of @xmath244 @xcite .",
    "the temperature is sufficiently low ( @xmath245 k ) so that desorption is negligeable .",
    "even at small angles of incidence ( between @xmath246 and @xmath247 ) , the growth is anisotropic .",
    "the stm images @xcite show some evidence for striped pattern formation , if larger sample areas ( @xmath248 nm on each side ) are imaged .",
    "it is encouraging that a growth exponent close to 1/3 is observed since this matches our prediction for the transverse direction ; unfortunately , there seems to be no evidence for the much smaller exponent ( @xmath249 ) which should control the parallel direction . a final resolution of these issues has to await a more detailed analysis of the experimental data .",
