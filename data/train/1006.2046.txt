    "if we regularize massless fermions naively on a lattice , it is unavoidable that species doublers appear .",

    "however , species doublers of chiral fermions on a lattice are usually considered as unwanted particles , the so called doubling problem , although the enlarged degree of freedom ( d.o.f . )",
    "is customarily identified as a flavor ( taste ) d.o.f",
    "..    the equivalence of the above naive fermion formulation and the staggered fermion formulation can be shown by a spin diagonalization procedure  @xcite and the staggered fermion can be transformed into the kogut - susskind type fermion formulation  @xcite by considering double size lattice structure , where the flavor d.o.f .",
    "was identified  @xcite .",
    "this double size structure makes it possible to have a correspondence with differential forms and then the equivalence of the staggered fermion and dirac - khler fermion on the lattice can be proved by introducing a noncommutativity between differential forms and fields  @xcite . therefore all these lattice fermion formulations are exactly equivalent .    in the link approach of lattice supersymmetry  @xcite ,",
    "the super charges are expanded on the basis of dirac matrices by the dirac - khler twisting procedure  @xcite . the corresponding d.o.f . of the super charges",
    "are then exactly the same as those of fermionic species doublers and the geometric correspondence between the particles as species doublers and super multiplets is expected from the equivalence of the naive fermion and dirac - khler fermion formulations on the lattice . in other words",
    "the species doublers are necessary fields to construct the super multiplets of extended supersymmetry : @xmath0 in two dimensions and n=4 in four dimensions .",
    "the flavor ( taste ) d.o.f . of chiral fermions",
    "are thus expected to be identified as extended supersymmetry d.o.f .. in this paper we explicitly show how the species doublers for both fermions and bosons can be identified as super multiplets of extended supersymmetry for the simplest model of @xmath0 in one dimension .",
    "we propose to introduce lattice counter parts of bosonic and fermionic `` superfields '' where species doublers are accommodated .",
    "the one dimensional @xmath0 model was proposed as a supersymmetric quantum mechanics by witten  @xcite and the lattice version has been investigated by several authors  @xcite as the simplest model to clarify the fundamental problems of lattice supersymmetry .",
    "it was shown that a species doubler of the wilson fermion term , having a mass proportional to the inverse lattice constant , breaks supersymmetry and a bosonic counter term is needed to remove the unwanted contribution  @xcite .",
    "numerical evaluation of boson and fermion masses show that they approach the same value in the continuum limit , suggesting the recovery of supersymmetry , only when the counter term is introduced  @xcite . in this model",
    "the species doubler interferes with supersymmetry and its influence has to be removed by the bosonic counter term .",
    "it has also been recognized that only one exact supersymmetry of the type @xmath2 , which can be identified as the scalar part of a twisted supersymmetry for this supersymmetric quantum mechanics , is realized when interaction terms are included  @xcite .",
    "this system also provides a nice arena for a numerical method for detecting spontaneous supersymmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "one dimensional @xmath0 lattice supersymmetric model of this paper is constructed in parallel to the continuum superspace formulation  @xcite and is slightly different from the supersymmetric quantum mechanics model .",
    "the lattice model we propose in this paper is exactly supersymmetric for two supersymmetry charges even with interaction terms and the counter term is not necessary to fulfill ward - takahshi identity since the bosonic and fermionic species doublers are identified as physical particles in supermultiplets . in the momentum representation",
    "this model has , however , a lattice counter part of trigonometric momentum conservation , which was first proposed by dondi and nicolai  @xcite in the very first paper of lattice supersymmetry . in the coordinate space",
    "we introduce a new star product which makes the lattice difference operator satisfy leibniz rule and then the exact lattice supersymmetry is realized .",
    "the model has mildly nonlocal interactions which approach local interactions in the continuum limit .",
    "there is a long history of attempts to realize exact sypersymmetry on a lattice .",
    "see @xcite for some references .",
    "however exact lattice supersymmetry with interactions for full extended supersymmetry has never been realized except for the nilpotent super charge .",
    "this difficulty is essentially related to the lattice chiral fermion problem and to the breakdown of the leibniz rule for the lattice difference operator . instead of formulating an exact supersymmetry for local interactions in the coordinate space",
    ", there has been several attempts that approach the problem from momentum representation point of view  @xcite .",
    "this may be related to the following claim : if one tries to include the difference operator in a supersymmetry algebra , one can not avoid introducing nonlocal interactions  @xcite .",
    "the momentum representation can take care the nonlocal nature of the formulation . in this paper",
    "we first establish a formulation of exact lattice supersymmetry in the momentum representation .",
    "then we reformulate the momentum space version into the coordinate space by introducing a new non local `` star '' product .    in the link approach for lattice supersymmetry  @xcite the claim that exact lattice supersymmetry had been realized for all super charges",
    "was questioned by several authors  @xcite .",
    "in fact it was stressed that all the extended supersymmetry are broken when the shift parameter of the scalar super charge is non zero @xmath3  @xcite while it exactly coincides with the orbifold construction of lattice supersymmetry when @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "it was however shown later on that lattice supersymmetry can be formulated consistently within the framework of a hopf algebra , accounting for the breaking of the leibniz rule for the difference operator , and of the mild noncommutativity between fields carrying a shift .",
    "thus exact lattice supersymmetry holds within the hopf algebraic symmetry  @xcite .",
    "one of the important aims of the present paper is to clarify the fundamental nature of the link approach within a simple one - dimensional model .",
    "since we find a new exact lattice supersymmetry formulation , it would be interesting to compare the algebraic structure of the link approach with this new formulation .",
    "we point out the interesting possibility , supported by several arguments , that the star product formulation of current model and the link approach formulation are equivalent .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we explain the basic ideas of the formulation in section 2 .",
    "we then briefly explain the continuum version of the model which we investigate in this paper in section 3",
    ". then it will be explained in section 4 how the species doublers can be naturally accommodated into supersymmetry transformations together with trigonometric momentum conservation . in section 5 an exact supersymmetry invariant action with interaction terms in momentum representation on the infinite lattice will be proposed . in section 6",
    "the recovery of the translational invariance of this model in the continuum limit is investigated .",
    "it will be confirmed that supersymmetric ward - takahashi identities are satisfied . in section 7",
    "we propose a new star product which makes lattice difference operator satisfy leibniz rule and exact lattice supersymmetry be realized in the coordinate space .",
    "a close connection with the link approach will be discussed .",
    "we then summarize the result of this paper and discuss remaining problems in the final section . in the appendix 1-loop radiative corrections of propagators in ward - takahashi identity",
    "are summarized .",
    "one of the most distinctive features of the so called link approach to lattice supersymmetry is the introduction in place of the usual hyper cubic lattice of extended lattices that account for the underlying supersymmetry algebra .",
    "the idea is the following : on the lattice infinitesimal translations are replaced by finite displacements , or shifts , represented typically for an hyper cubic lattice by orthogonal vectors @xmath5 of length equal to the lattice spacing @xmath6 .",
    "the vectors @xmath5 generate the whole lattice and each point of the lattice can be reached from a given point by means of a finite number of such displacements .",
    "it follows that a translationally invariant field configuration , or vacuum , is a constant field configuration on the lattice . in the link approach a shift @xmath7",
    "is associated also to each supersymmetry charge @xmath8 , in the same way as @xmath5 is associated to the generator @xmath9 of translations .",
    "the shifts @xmath7 are not arbitrary , but they are constrained by the supersymmetry algebra : consistency with the algebra requires that the constraint @xmath10 must be satisfied for each non - vanishing anticommutator @xmath11 of the superalgebra .",
    "only a limited number of supersymmetry algebras , in particular the @xmath0 susy algebra in @xmath12 dimensions and the @xmath13 susy algebra in @xmath14 dimensions , are compatible with these constraints .",
    "the extended lattices introduced in the link approach are generated by the displacements @xmath7 and @xmath5 and hence contain , with respect to the standard hyper cubic lattices , new links of the type @xmath15 which we will call `` fermionic '' and new points .",
    "the key remark now is that not all points of the extended lattices can be reached from a given one simply by translations .",
    "an extended lattice will consist in general of more copies of the hyper cubic lattice connected by `` fermionic '' links , and translations will only make us move within each copy .",
    "so for a field configuration to be invariant under translations it is not necessary to be constant over the whole extended lattice but only separately over each copy of the hyper cubic lattice .",
    "in other words the number of field configurations which are invariant under translations in an extended lattice is equal to the number of hyper cubic sublattices contained in it .",
    "consider as an example the @xmath0 superalgebra in @xmath12 dimensions .",
    "this superalgebra contains four supersymmetry charges @xmath8 besides the generators of translations in two dimensions . in its discrete lattice version ,",
    "described in detail in ref  @xcite , four shifts @xmath7 are associated to the four supesymmetry charges , constrained by the non - vanishing anticommutators of the superalgebra , as discussed above . the constraints do not determine @xmath7 completely : one of them is arbitrary .",
    "however if we further require the resulting extended lattice to be invariant under @xmath16 rotations , then the solution is unique and given by _ a = ( , ) , [ aa ] where @xmath6 denotes the lattice spacing .",
    "the vectors ( [ aa ] ) , together with the shifts associated to translations , namely @xmath17 and @xmath18 , generate the extended lattice of the @xmath0 , @xmath19 susy algebra .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : lattice ] ) .",
    "the points @xmath20 of the lattice have coordinates : = ( , ) , [ vecx ] where @xmath21 is even ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 both even or both odd ) .",
    "takes the same value @xmath24 in both @xmath25 and @xmath26 points , while @xmath27 takes the value @xmath28 in the @xmath25 points and @xmath29 in the @xmath26 points . adjoining @xmath25 and @xmath26 points",
    "are joined by the fermionic links which are not shown in the figure . ]",
    "the extended lattice is then made by two copies of the cubic lattice , in fact by the original lattice ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 even ) and its dual ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 odd ) connected by the `` fermionic '' links @xmath30 .",
    "it is clear that there are two independent field configurations on the extended lattice that are invariant under translation , namely : _ 1 ( ) = c_1  ,  _ 2 ( ) = ( -1)^n c_2 , [ vcconf1 ] with @xmath24 and @xmath31 constant .",
    "it is interesting to note that this phase remind us of the phase of staggered fermion  @xcite this is relevant because we expect the degrees of freedom of the theory in the continuum limit to be associated to small fluctuations around translationally invariant vacua , so that fluctuations around the two configurations of eq .",
    "( [ vcconf1 ] ) will correspond to two distinct degrees of freedom in the continuum limit .",
    "hence one degree of freedom on the extended lattice will absorb two degrees of freedom of the continuum theory .",
    "this fact , namely that the extended lattice implies a correspondingly reduced number of independent fields , was not fully appreciated in the original formulation of the link approach and is one of the key points of the present paper .",
    "it is clear that since the different copies of the hyper cubic lattice in an extended lattice are generated by the extra links associated to supersymmetry charges it is natural to expect the different continuum degrees of freedom associated to a single lattice degree of freedom to be part of a supersymmetric multiplet .",
    "it is instructive to look at the previous example from the point of view of the momentum space representation , which will play a crucial role in what follows .",
    "the first brillouin zone associated to the lattice ( [ vecx ] ) is the square defined by @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "that means that in the momentum space fields will be periodic with period @xmath34 in the variables @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the translationally invariant field configurations ( [ vcconf ] ) correspond respectively to the center of the square , namely @xmath37 , and to the four vertices ( which are all equivalent due to the periodicity ) , namely @xmath38 or @xmath39 .",
    "the latter is exaclty the species doubler .",
    "a solution of the fermion doubling problem becomes now possible .",
    "fermion doubling originates from the fact that the fermionic kinetic term has a simple zero at @xmath37 and hence has to vanish somewhere else in the brillouin zone due to the lattice periodicity . within the extended lattice scheme",
    "if the second zero occurs in correspondence of the other translationally invariant vacuum the would be doubler can be interpreted as a physical field , in fact as a supersymmetric partner of the original one at @xmath37 .",
    "we have used the example of the extended lattice of the @xmath0 , @xmath19 supersymmetry to illustrate the ideas that we are going to develop in this paper . however the explicit example that we are going to study is a simpler one , @xmath0 supersymmetric model in one dimension ( @xmath1 ) . before going into that we are going to consider an even simpler example , that has been considered in the present context in ref .",
    "this is a one dimensional model with an @xmath40 supersymmetry .",
    "it is described in terms of a superfield : ( x,)= ( x ) + i ( x ) , [ superfield-0]with a supersymmetry charge given by : q = + i , [ susycharge]and q^2 = i .",
    "[ qsquare]on the lattice derivatives are replaced by finite shifts of length @xmath6 , hence consistency with the algebra ( [ qsquare ] ) requires that the supercharge @xmath41 is associated to a shift @xmath42 .",
    "the extended lattice is then a one dimensional lattice with spacing @xmath42 , which can be thought of as the superposition of two lattices with spacing @xmath6 each invariant under translations and separated by a an @xmath42 shift associated to the susy charge .",
    "again there are two field configurations invariant under translations , namely : _",
    "1(x ) = c_1  ,  _",
    "2(x ) = ( -1)^ c_2 [ vcconf ] with @xmath43 . according to the previous discussion fluctuations around @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    "will describe in the continuum limit two distinct degrees of freedom .",
    "however we have just two degrees of freedom in this model , one bosonic and one fermionic , so the natural thing is to associate the bosonic degree of freedom to fluctuations around @xmath44 and the fermionic one to fluctuations around @xmath45 .    to understand the origin of the hyper lattice structure of half lattice step and the alternating sign states , let us look at the algebraic relation of the superfield and the supercharge from a matrix point of view  @xcite .",
    "we now introduce the following matrix form of the super coordinate and its derivative as : =    0 & 1 + 0 & 0    ,   =    0 & 0 + 1 & 0    , which satisfy the following anticommutation relation : \\",

    "with respect to this internal structure the boson @xmath46 is considered as a field which commutes with @xmath47 and @xmath48 and the fermion @xmath49 as a field which anticommutes with them . the component fields of boson and fermion with respect to this internal structure has then the following form : ( x)=    \\(x ) & 0 + 0 & ( x )    , [ boson - matrix ] ( x)=    \\(x ) & 0 + 0 & -(x )    .",
    "[ fermion - matrix ] in the matrix formulation of fields the coordinate dependence can be introduced by diagonal entries of a big matrix as direct product to the internal matrix structure  @xcite . from the degrees of freedom point of view for n=1 model in one dimension",
    "two fields of boson and fermion on the same lattice site have this internal matrix structure ( [ boson - matrix ] ) and ( [ fermion - matrix ] ) .",
    "if we consider the @xmath0 model in one dimension , which we will consider later in this paper , there are four independent fields on one site we may then consider that the four fields of internal matrix structure may be identified with the four independent d.o.f . of fields .",
    "we now ask a question : `` how do we interpret this internal space time structure on the lattice ? ''",
    "a natural identification is an introduction of a half lattice step structure to make a correspondence with two translational invariant states in ( [ vcconf ] ) .",
    "we can then identify a constant field of @xmath50 in ( [ boson - matrix ] ) as @xmath44 in ( [ vcconf ] ) and a constant field of @xmath51 in ( [ fermion - matrix ] ) as @xmath45 in ( [ vcconf ] ) .",
    "one can then write a lattice `` superfield '' corresponding to ( [ superfield-0 ] ) as ( x ) = ( x ) + ( -1)^ ( x ) [ lattsup ] , where we have introduced a factor @xmath52 for later convenience and taken away the factor @xmath53 since the second term is not a product of two grassmann numbers to keep hermiticity . since @xmath47 and @xmath48 are not hermitian by them self in this matrix representation we have to take care the hermiticity separately . it is crucial to recognize at this stage that the super coordinate structure and fermionic nature of @xmath49 can be accommodated by the alternating sign factor of half lattice spacing if this simple lattice representation works as a superfield .",
    "we now introduce a matrix form of a fermionic super parameter by =    & 0 + 0 & -    , [ alpha - matrix ] where @xmath54 is a grassmann odd parameter .",
    "this parameter can then be expressed as @xmath55 in accordance with the representation of the lattice superfield in ( [ lattsup ] ) .",
    "we now propose lattice supersymmetry transformations as a finite difference over a half lattice spacing @xmath42 : ( x ) = a^- ( -1)^ ( ( x+ ) - ( x ) ) .",

    "however in the proof of the supersymmetry invariance of the kinetic terms and the mass terms in the coordinate representation leibniz rule has been used for the normal products and thus the relations ( [ q2-*leibniz ] ) and ( [ deriv-*leibniz ] ) should hold for the normal products , at least for the product of two fields , which seems to be inconsistent with the shifted leibniz rule of symmetric difference operator ( [ symm - diff - leip ] ) .",
