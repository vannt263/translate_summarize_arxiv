    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is believed to be the underlying theory of the strong interaction , which has three fundamental properties : asymptotic freedom , color confinement , approximate chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking . in the high energy regime",
    ", qcd has been tested up to @xmath1 level . in the low energy sector , qcd is highly nonperturbative due to the non - abelian su@xmath2(3 ) color group structure .",
    "it is very difficult to calculate the whole hadron spectrum from first principles in qcd . with the rapid development of new ideas and computing power",
    ", lattice gauge theory may provide the final solution to the spectrum problem in the future .",
    "but now , people have just been able to understand the first orbital and radial excitations of the nucleon with lattice qcd in the baryon sector @xcite .",
    "under such a circumstance , various models which are qcd - based or incorporate some important properties of qcd were proposed to explain the hadron spectrum and other low - energy properties . among them , it is fair to say that quark model has been the most successful one . it is widely used to classify hadrons and calculate their masses , static properties and low - energy reactions @xcite . according to quark model , mesons are composed of a pair of quark and anti - quark while baryons are composed of three quarks .",
    "both mesons and baryons are color singlets .",
    "most of the experimentally observed hadrons can be easily accommodated in the quark model .",
    "any state with the quark content other than @xmath3 or @xmath4 is beyond quark model , which is termed as non - conventional or exotic .",
    "for example , it is hard for @xmath5 to find a suitable position in quark model .",
    "instead it could be a kaon molecule or four quark state @xcite .",
    "however , besides conventional mesons and baryons , qcd itself does not exclude the existence of the non - conventional states such as glueballs ( @xmath6 ) , hybrid mesons ( @xmath7 ) , and other multi - quark states ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) .",
    "in fact , hybrid mesons can mix freely with conventional mesons in the large @xmath12 limit @xcite . in the early days of qcd , jaffe proposed the h particle @xcite with mit bag model , which was a six quark state .",
    "unfortunately it was not found experimentally .    in the past years there",
    "have accumulated some experimental evidence of possible existence of glueballs and hybrid mesons with exotic quantum numbers like @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "recently bes collaboration observed a possible signal of a proton anti - proton baryonium in the @xmath14 radiative decays @xcite . but",
    "none of these states has been pinned down without controversy until the surprising discovery of pentaquarks by leps collaboration @xcite .",
    "early last year leps collaboration at the spring-8 facility in japan observed a sharp resonance @xmath0 at @xmath15 gev with a width smaller than 25 mev and a statistical significance of @xmath16 in the reaction @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "this resonance decays into @xmath18 , hence carries strangeness @xmath19 . later , many other groups have claimed the observation of this state @xcite .",
    "all known baryons with @xmath20 carry negative or zero strangeness .",
    "such a resonance is clearly beyond the conventional quark model with the minimum quark content @xmath21 .",
    "now it s called @xmath0 pentaquark in literature .",
    "a compilation of @xmath0 mass and decay width is presented in figure ( [ mao ] ) .",
    "na49 collaboration announced evidence for the existence of a new narrow @xmath22 baryon resonance @xmath23 with mass of @xmath24 gev and width below the detector resolution of about 0.018 gev in proton - proton collisions at @xmath25 gev @xcite .",
    "the quantum number of this state is @xmath26 and its quark content is @xmath27 .",
    "they also observed signals for the @xmath28 member of the same isospin quartet with a quark content of @xmath29 in the @xmath30 spectrum .",
    "the corresponding anti - baryon spectra also show enhancements at the same invariant mass .",
    "h1 collaboration claimed the discovery of a heavy pentaquark around 3099 mev with the quark content @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "very recently , star collaboration at rhic observed a narrow peak at @xmath32 mev in the @xmath33 invariant mass which was interpreted as an @xmath34 pentaquark @xcite .",
    "however its antiparticle was not observed yet .",
    "there is preliminary evidence that the @xmath0 is an iso - scalar because no enhancement was observed in the @xmath35 invariant mass distribution @xcite .",
    "the third component of its isospin is @xmath36 .",
    "so the @xmath0 pentaquark is very probably an iso - scalar if it is a member of the anti - decuplet . at present , the possibility of this state being a member of another multiplet is not completely excluded .",
    "hence its total isospin is probably zero .",
    "most of the theoretical models assume that @xmath0 is in @xmath37 @xmath38 representation .",
    "all the other quantum numbers including its angular momentum and parity remain undetermined . however , most of theoretical work postulated its angular momentum to be one half because of its low mass . but",
    "the possibility of @xmath39 still can not be excluded completely .",
    "it is important to point out that many other experimental groups reported negative results @xcite .",
    "for example , the existence of @xmath23 is still under debate @xcite .",
    "compared with 1640 @xmath40 candidates produced in proton proton collisions in na49 s analysis , wa89 collaboration found no signal of @xmath41 pentaquark with @xmath42 @xmath40 candidates in their data sample @xcite .",
    "a long list of experiments yielding negative results including those unpublished can be found in ref .",
    "although the @xmath0 pentaquark has been listed as a three - star resonance in the 2004 pdg , its existence is still not completely established .",
    "one can use some textbook group theory to write down the pentaquark wave functions in the framework of quark model .",
    "because of its low mass , high orbital excitation with @xmath43 seems unlikely .",
    "pauli principle requires the totally anti - symmetric wave functions for the four light quarks .",
    "since the anti - quark is in the @xmath44_c$ ] representation , the four quark color wave function is @xmath45_c$ ] .",
    "with @xmath46 , hence @xmath47 , the 4q spatial wave function is symmetric , i.e. , @xmath48_o$ ] .",
    "their @xmath49 spin - flavor wave function must be @xmath50_{fs}^{210}$ ] which contains @xmath51_f^6 \\times [ 31]_s^3 $ ] after decomposition into @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "here 210 , 6 etc is the dimension of the representation . when combined with anti - quark , we get @xmath53_f^{10}+[21]_f^8\\right)\\times \\left([41]_s+[32]_s\\right)$ ] , which is nothing but @xmath54 in terms of more common notation . the total angular momentum of the four quarks is one .",
    "the resulting exotic anti - decuplet is always accompanied by a nearly degenerate octet .",
    "their angular momentum and parity is either @xmath55 or @xmath56 .    with @xmath57 and @xmath58 ,",

    ". only this representation can combine with @xmath45_c$ ] color wave function to ensure that the 4q total wave functions are anti - symmetric .",
    "the 4q orbital wave function is @xmath50_o$ ] .",
    "there are four @xmath49 wave functions @xmath48_{fs } , [ 31]_{fs } , [ 22]_{fs } , [ 211]_{fs}$ ] which allow the 4q total wave function to be anti - symmetric and lead to the octet and exotic anti - decuplet @xcite .",
    "we are still unable to solve the hadron spectrum starting from first principles of qcd analytically .",
    "lattice qcd simulation may play a very important role eventually .",
    "but right now , lattice simulation of pentaquarks by several groups has not converged yet .",
    "for example , one lattice calculation favors positive parity for pentaquarks @xcite while two previous lattice simulations favor negative parity @xcite .",
    "the most recent lattice simulation did not observe any bound pentaquark state in either @xmath60 or @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "we will not discuss lattice results in this review .",
    "interested readers are referred to the above references .    in the field of pentaquarks , there are three outstanding pending issues : the @xmath0 parity , the dynamical generation of its low mass and its narrow width . up to now theoretical papers in the literature",
    "can roughly be classified into two types according to their assumption of @xmath0 parity .",
    "theoretical approaches advocating positive parity include the chiral soliton model ( csm ) @xcite , the diquark model @xcite , some quark models @xcite , a lattice calculation @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , some other theoretical approaches tend to favor negative parity such as two lattice qcd simulations @xcite , qcd sum rule approaches @xcite , several quark model study @xcite , and proposing stable diamond structure for @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "there are many proposals to measure @xmath0 parity either through doubly polarized proton proton scattering @xcite or photo - production processes @xcite .",
    "now most of photo - production papers assume that pentaquarks are produced from the following four processes : s - channel , u - channel , t - channel through charged meson exchange and the contact seagull diagram .",
    "if such a mechanism is correct , then the production cross section of producing a positive parity @xmath0 pentaquark is one or two orders larger than that of producing a negative parity @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the inclusion of charge vector meson in the t - channel increases the cross section significantly @xcite .    since leps s first experimental paper , there have appeared more than two hundred theoretical papers on pentaquarks .",
    "it s both impossible and unnecessary to exhaust them in the present short review . in the following ,",
    "i focus on several models to illustrate these pending issues .",
    "theoretical study of pentaquark states dated back to the early days of qcd using mit bag model @xcite .",
    "the recent interest in the @xmath0 pentaquark started with the prediction of its mass , width and reaction channel from the chiral soliton model ( csm ) in ref .",
    "@xcite a few years ago .",
    "diakonov et al .",
    "proposed the possible existence of the @xmath62 @xmath63 resonance at @xmath64 mev with a width less than 15 mev using the chiral soliton model @xcite , which partly motivated the recent experimental search of this particle .",
    "the authors argued that @xmath0 is the lightest member of the anti - decuplet multiplet in the third rotational state of the chiral soliton model . assuming that the @xmath65 is a member of the anti - decuplet , @xmath0 mass is fixed with the symmetry consideration of the model .",
    "however this prediction is very sensitive to the model inputs @xcite .",
    "for example , either adopting the commonly used value @xmath66 mev for the @xmath67-term or identifying @xmath65 as a member of the anti - decuplet will lead to a @xmath68 pentaquark mass @xmath69 mev higher than that observed by na49 collaboration @xcite .",
    "an updated reanalysis indicates @xmath0 mass is really quite low within the framework of the chiral soliton model : 1430 mev @xmath70 1660 mev @xcite .",
    "for example , with the new larger value @xmath71 mev and @xmath72 mev from two recent analysis @xcite for the @xmath67-term , a fairly good description of both @xmath0 and @xmath41 masses is possible @xcite . in csm ,",
    "the narrow width comes from the cancellation between the coupling constants in the leading order , next - leading order and next - next - leading order large @xmath12 expansion .",
    "however , the theoretical foundation of the treatment of the pentaquarks in the chiral soliton model is challenged by the large @xmath12 formalism in refs .",
    "@xcite . from the large @xmath12 consistency consideration",
    ", cohen found that predictions for a light collective @xmath0 baryon state ( with strangeness + 1 ) based on the collective quantization of chiral soliton models are shown to be inconsistent with large @xmath12 qcd since collective quantization is legitimate only for excitations which vanish as @xmath73 .    in the large @xmath12 limit ,",
    "the mass splitting between the @xmath74 decuplet and the nucleon octet is @xmath75 while the excitation energy of the vibration mode of the hedgehog is @xmath76 .",
    "hence the rotational degree of freedom decouples from the vibration mode in the large @xmath12 limit .",
    "the collective quantization is valid for the octet and decuplet .",
    "the predictions for these two multiplets from the chiral soliton model is reliable .",
    "in contrast , the mass splitting between the anti - decuplet and octet is also @xmath77 . in other words ,",
    "the rotation and vibration motions are not orthogonal",
    ". they will mix with each other , which invalidates the collective quantization of the rotational degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , cohen concluded that the prediction of @xmath0 properties based on collective quantization of csm was fortuitous @xcite .",
    "large @xmath12 formalism does nt predict the existence of @xmath0 pentaquark .",
    "however , large @xmath12 formalism may still be a useful tool to relate properties of different pentaquarks such as their mass splitting and decay width once one _ assumes _ the existence of pentaquarks @xcite .",
    "if @xmath0 is established by experiments , then one may use large @xmath12 expansion technique to predict the existence of the other members and their properties within the same multiplet .",
    "the relationship between the bound state and the su(3 ) rigid rotator approaches to strangeness in the skyrme model was investigated in @xcite .",
    "it was found that the exotic state may be an artifact of the rigid rotator approach to the skyrme model for large @xmath12 and small @xmath78 .      since early last year",
    ", there appeared many theoretical papers trying to interpret these exotic states . among them , jaffe and wilczek s ( jw ) diquark model is a typical one @xcite . in their model ,",
    "the @xmath0 pentaquark is composed of a pair of diquarks and a strange anti - quark .",
    "the flavor anti - decuplet is always accompanied by an octet which is nearly degenerate and mix with the decuplet .",
    "jaffe and wilczek s ( jw ) proposed that there exists strong correlation between the light quark pair when they are in the anti - symmetric color @xmath79 , flavor @xmath80 , isospin @xmath81 and spin @xmath82 configuration @xcite .",
    "the lighter the quarks , the stronger the correlation , which helps the light quark pair form a diquark . for example",
    ", the ud diquark behaves like a scalar with positive parity .",
    "such correlation may arise from the color spin force from the one gluon exchange or the flavor spin force induced by the instanton interaction .",
    "they proposed that pentaquark states are composed of two scalar diquarks and one anti - quark .",
    "diquarks obey bose statistics .",
    "each diquark is in the antisymmetric color @xmath83 state .",
    "the spin wave function of the two quarks within each scalar diquark is antisymmetric while the spatial part is symmetric .",
    "pauli principle requires the total wave function of the two quarks in the diquark be anti - symmetric .",
    "thus the flavor wave function of the two quarks in the diquark must be antisymmetric , i.e , the diquark is in the flavor @xmath84 state .",
    "the color wave function of the two diquarks within the pentaquark must be antisymmetric @xmath85 so that the resulting pentaquark is a color singlet . in order to accommodate the exotic @xmath0 pentaquark , jaffe and wilczek required the flavor wave function of the diquark pair to be symmetric @xmath86 : @xmath87 ^ 2 $ ] , @xmath87[ds]_+$ ] , @xmath88 ^ 2 $ ] , @xmath88[ds]_+$ ] ,",
    "@xmath89 ^ 2 $ ] , and @xmath89[ud]_+$ ] .",
    "simple group theory tells us that @xmath90 . in other words ,",
    "the pentaquark anti - decuplet is always accompanied by an octet which is nearly degenerate and probably mixes with the anti - decuplet .",
    "bose statistics demands symmetric total wave function of the diquark - diquark system , which leads to the antisymmetric spatial wave function with one orbital excitation .",
    "the resulting anti - decuplet and octet pentaquarks have @xmath91 .    in general , the lower the angular mentum , the lower the mass .",
    "so the @xmath39 pentaquark will be heavier than its @xmath92 partner . but",
    "their mass difference is not expected to larger than @xmath93 mev if we could rely on the past experience with the @xmath74 and nucleon mass splitting .",
    "if the @xmath0 pentaquark does exist and the diquark model is correct , then its @xmath94 pentaquark partner should also be reachable by future experiments .",
    "the members of pentaquark anti - decuplet are @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "jaffe and wilczek pointed out that one of the decay modes @xmath105 observed by na49 @xcite signals the existence of an additional octet around @xmath106 mev together the anti - decuplet since the latter can not decay into a decuplet and an octet in the @xmath37 symmetry limit .",
    "if further confirmed , this experiment poses a serious challenge to the chiral soliton model because there is no baryon pentaquark octet in the rotational band in this model .",
    "but it may be hard to exclude it since there always exist excited vibrational octet modes .",
    "these modes can not be calculated rigourously within the chiral soliton model @xcite .",
    "however , in jw s model @xmath0 is not the lightest pentaquark as in the chiral soliton model .",
    "the ideal mixing between the octet and anti - decuplet will split the spectrum and produce two nucleon - like states . using the @xmath0 mass as input ,",
    "the higher one @xmath107 is around 1710 mev with a quark content @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the up or down quark .",
    "the lighter one @xmath110 is lower than the @xmath0 pentaquark with a quark content @xmath111 .",
    "jaffe and wilczek identified @xmath110 as the well - known roper resonance @xmath112 @xcite , which is a very broad four - star resonance with a width around @xmath113 mev .",
    "however , it will be very demanding to explain roper s large decay width and @xmath0 s extremely narrow width simultaneously in a natural way .",
    "the problem with the identification of the ideally mixed positive parity pentaquarks with the @xmath65 and @xmath112 is discussed extensively in @xcite .",
    "if jaffe and wilczek s diquark picture for @xmath114 pentaquark is correct , we pointed out @xcite that lighter pentaquarks can be formed if the two scalar diquarks are in the antisymmetric @xmath115 @xmath116 representation : @xmath87[su]_-$ ] , @xmath87[ds]_-$ ] , and @xmath88[ds]_-$ ] , where @xmath117[q_3q_4]_-=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}([q_1q_2][q_3q_4]-[q_3q_4][q_1q_2])$ ] .",
    "no orbital excitation is needed to ensure the symmetric total wave function of two diquarks since the spin - flavor - color part is symmetric .",
    "the total angular momentum of these pentaquarks is @xmath118 and the parity is negative .",
    "there is no accompanying @xmath39 multiplet .",
    "the two diquarks combine with the antiquark to form a @xmath115 pentaquark octet and singlet : @xmath119 @xmath120 @xmath121 .",
    "similar mechanism has been proposed to study heavy pentaquarks with negative parity and lighter mass than @xmath122 in @xcite .    because there is no orbital excitation within these nine pentaquarks , their masses are lower than the anti - decuplet and the accompanying octet with positive parity .",
    "their masses range between 1360 mev and 1540 mev according to our calculation using the same mass formula in @xcite .",
    "these states are close to the l=1 orbital excitations of the nucleon octet .",
    "the mixing between the pentaquark states and orbital excitations is expected to be small since their spatial wave functions are very different .    according to our calculation , two of the @xmath123",
    "octet pentaquark members @xmath124 lie 22 mev below the @xmath125 threshold and 228 mev below the @xmath126 threshold .",
    "the `` fall - apart '' decay mechanism forbids @xmath127 to decay into one nucleon and one pion .",
    "although their interaction is of s - wave , lack of phase space forbids the strong decays @xmath128 to happen .    for @xmath127 , the only kinematically",
    "strong decays are s - wave @xmath129 , p - wave @xmath130 and s - wave @xmath131 decays where @xmath132 is either a proton or neutron .",
    "all these decay modes involve the annihilation of a strange quark pair and violate the the `` fall - apart '' mechanism .",
    "hence the width is expected to be small .",
    "both @xmath127 and @xmath133 may be narrow resonances .",
    "it is interesting to note there are three negative - parity @xmath134 particles within the range between 1400 mev and 1540 mev if jaffe and wilczek s diquark model is correct .",
    "one of them is the well established @xmath135 .",
    "@xmath135 is only 30 mev below kaon and nucleon threshold .",
    "some people postulated it to be a kaon nucleon molecule @xcite .",
    "we propose that there is another intriguing possibility of interpreting @xmath135 as the candidate of @xmath123 pentaquark .",
    "the other @xmath123 pentaquark and the corresponding l=1 singlet @xmath134 particle may have escaped detection so far .",
    "the discovery of nine additional negative - parity baryons in this mass range will be strong evidence supporting the diquark model .",
    "then one has to consider the possibility of treating diquarks as an effective degree of freedom as constituent quarks when dealing with hadron spectrum .",
    "one possible consequence is the appearance of many exotic mesons and over - population of meson states with non - exotic quantum numbers below 2 gev . on the other hand ,",
    "if future experimental searches fail to find any evidence of these additional states with negative parity , one has to re - evaluate the relevance of the diquark picture for the pentaquarks .",
    "an even simpler picture came from karliner and lipkin s diquark triquark model @xcite . in their model",
    "the two color non - singlet clusters are kept apart by the p - wave angular momentum barrier .",
    "hence the color magnetic interaction occurs within two clusters only . between two clusters",
    "the color electric forces bind them into a color singlet .",
    "the angular momentum barrier prevents them from rearranging into the usual @xmath136 system .",
    "the presence of p - wave ensures the overall @xmath0 parity is positive .",
    "the two quarks in the triquark are in the symmetric @xmath137 representation .",

    "the two quarks are in the anti - symmetric flavor @xmath140 representation and the triquark is in the symmetric @xmath141 .",
    "thus the spin wave function of the two quarks is symmetric .",
    "the spin of the triquark is one half .    the direct product of the @xmath142 of diquark and the @xmath143 of triquark leads to @xmath144 and @xmath145 pentaquarks .",
    "there is one orbital angular momentum @xmath57 between the diquark and the triquark .",

    "it s very demanding to reproduce the low mass of the @xmath0 pentaquark !    shuryak and zahed s ( sz ) suggested that the pentaquark mass be lower by replacing one scalar diquark with one tensor diaquark in jw s model @xcite .",

    "@xcite hosaka emphasized the important role of the hedgehog pion in the strong interaction dynamics which drives the formation of the @xmath0 particle and the detailed energy level ordering .    in the adiabatic approximation , zhang et al employed the chiral quark model to make a systematic comparison study of the @xmath0 pentaquark mass with both parities @xcite .",

    "it is emphasized that the possibility of @xmath0 being a @xmath156 state has not been ruled out yet @xcite .    from previous quark model experience , one would naively expect the strange pentaquark mass with positive parity to be around @xmath157 mev , where @xmath158 mev and @xmath159 mev are roughly the up and strange quark constituent mass .",
    "the additional @xmath160 mev comes from one orbital excitation for the positive - parity @xmath0 .",

    "instead , qsr incorporates two basic properties of qcd as its starting point : confinement and approximate chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking .",

    "the @xmath0 pentaquark mass was first studied using the interpolating current @xcite @xmath161 \\ { u_e ( x)\\\\ \\times { \\bar s}_e ( x ) i\\gamma_5 d_c(x ) - \\left ( u\\leftrightarrow d\\right ) \\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath162 ensures the isospin of the up and down quark pair inside the first bracket to be zero .",
    "the anti - symmetrization in the second bracket ensures that the isospin of the other up and down quark pair is also zero .",
    "the following correlation function was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath163 where @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "the spectral density of @xmath166 reads @xmath167\\\\ \\nonumber + [ { 7\\over 432}\\langle \\bar q q\\rangle^3 \\langle \\bar s s\\rangle + { 1\\over 864}\\langle \\bar q q\\rangle^4 ] \\delta ( s)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after invoking the factorization approximation for the multi - quark condensates .",
    "the mass of @xmath0 pentaquark is @xmath168 with @xmath169 except that @xmath170 does not contain the last term in @xmath171 .    the variation of @xmath172 with the borel parameter @xmath173 and the continuum threshold @xmath174 is shown in figure ( [ zhuprl ] ) , which contributes to the errors of the extracted value , together with the truncation of the operator product expansion , the uncertainty of vacuum condensate values and the factorization approximation of the multiquark condensates . in the working interval of the borel parameter @xmath172 is reasonably stable with @xmath173 .",
    "numerically , @xmath175 where the central value corresponds to @xmath176 gev and @xmath177 gev@xmath178 .",
    "an important observation from ref .",
    "@xcite is that the low mass of @xmath0 pentaquark could be accommodated in qcd .    later , several groups used various forms of interpolating currents to study the mass and parity of pentaquarks @xcite .",
    "however , the continuum contribution to the resulting mass sum rule is always big because of the high dimension of the interpolating current , which may render qsr treatment of pentaquarks less convincing than in the case of conventional hadrons .",
    "moreover , the convergence of the operator product expansion is not so good in certain cases .",
    "it s a general result that any pentaquark interpolating currents can always be decomposed into some linear combinations of the product of a color - singlet baryon interpolating current and a color - singlet meson interpolating current .",
    "some examples of the decomposition were given in @xcite .",
    "when we calculate the correlation function , we will have two types of contributions to the spectral density .",
    "the first one corresponds to the diagonal case where a pair of baryon and meson propagate freely .",
    "the second case corresponds to the non - diagonal case when the quark lines of the baryon mix with those from the meson .",
    "i.e. , the meson and baryon pair resonates into a pentaquark which then decays into a pair of meson and baryon .",
    "it is pointed out that the first case is the background contribution only and has nothing to do with the pentaquarks @xcite .",
    "hence this kind of contribution should be removed .",
    "bicudo proposed an interesting alternate scheme for @xmath0 baryon @xcite . using the resonating group method",
    ", he found that the repulsion is increased by pauli principle whenever the two interacting hadrons have a common flavor quark .",
    "the attraction is increased by the quark anti - quark annihilation effect if there is a pair of quark and anti - quark with the same flavor .",
    "the exotic @xmath0 baryon is unbound if its quark content is @xmath21 . in order to increase the binding",
    ", a light pair of quark and anti - quark has to be added in order to make the system bound . since the pion is the lightest meson , bicudo proposed that @xmath0 is probably a @xmath179@xmath180@xmath132 molecule with binding energy of 30 mev @xcite .",
    "the decay width has not been calculated yet in this model .",
    "however , one would naively expect such a loosely bound @xmath179@xmath180@xmath132 system is quite broad .",
    "according to these positive - result experiments , both @xmath0 and @xmath23 are very narrow states .",
    "in fact , the @xmath0 pentaquark is so narrow that most of the experiments can only set an upper bound around @xmath181 mev .",
    "recent analysis of kaon nucleon scattering data indicates that the width of the @xmath0 pentaquark is less than several mev @xcite , otherwise they should have shown up in these old experiments .",
    "experience with conventional excited hadrons shows that their widths are around one hundred mev or even bigger if they lie 100 mev above threshold and decay through s - wave or p - wave . for comparison ,",
    "the @xmath182 hyperon @xmath183 @xmath184 state is in the same mass region as the @xmath0 pentaquark .",
    "its angular momentum and parity is @xmath55 .",
    "its dominant two - body decay is of d - wave with final states @xmath185 , @xmath186 . with a smaller phase space and higher partial wave , the width of @xmath183",
    "is @xmath187 mev @xcite .",
    "in contrast , @xmath0 lies above 100 mev @xmath188 threshold and decays through either s - wave or p - wave with a total width less than several mev , corresponding to negative or positive parity respectively . if these states are further established and confirmed to have such a narrow width , the most challenging issue is to understand their extremely narrow width in a natural way .",
    "is there a mysterious selection rule which is absent from the conventional hadron interaction ?    in the case of pentaquark decays , if symmetry and kinematics allow , the most efficient decay mechanism is for the four quarks and anti - quark to regroup with each other int o a three - quark baryon and a meson .",
    "this is in contrast to the @xmath189 decay models for the ordinary hadrons .",
    "this regrouping is coined as the `` fall - apart '' mechanism in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently there have been several attempts to explain the narrow width of the @xmath0 pentaquark @xcite .",
    "carlson et al . constructed a special pentaquark wave function which is totally symmetric in the flavor - spin part and anti - symmetric in the color - orbital part in ref .",
    "@xcite . with this wave function",
    "they found that the overlap probability between the pentaquark and the nucleon kaon system is @xmath190 .",
    "taking into account of the orbital wave function in jw s diquark model further reduces the overlap probability to @xmath191 @xcite",
    ". the small overlap probability might be responsible for the narrow width of pentaquarks .",
    "karliner and lipkin proposed that there might exist two nearly generate pentaquarks @xcite .",
    "both of them decay into the kaon and nucleon .",
    "hence these two states mix with each other by the loop diagram via the decay modes .",
    "diagonalization of the mass matrix leads to a narrow @xmath0 pentaquark which almost decouples with the decay mode .",
    "the pentaquark with the same quantum number is very broad with a width of around 100 mev , which has escaped the experimental detection so far .    in ref .",
    "@xcite buccella and sorba suggested that the four quarks are in the @xmath57 state and the anti - quark is in the s - wave state inside the @xmath0 and @xmath23 pentaquarks .",
    "there are four anti - symmetric four quark @xmath49 wave functions @xmath48_{fs } , [ 31]_{fs } , [ 22]_{fs } , [ 211]_{fs}$ ] .",
    "the third one corresponds to jaffe and wilzcek s diquark model .",
    "the difference is the four quarks are not completely anti - symmetric in the diquark model .",
    "it was pointed out that the narrow width of @xmath0 pentaquark may favor the last two four - quark spin - flavor wave functions @xcite .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "when the anti - quark picks up a quark to form a meson , two of the other three quarks remain in the @xmath192 totally anti - symmetric states @xmath193_{fs } , [ 111]_{fs}$ ] .",
    "these representations are orthogonal to the @xmath49 totally symmetric representation @xmath194_{fs}$ ] for the nucleon octet .",
    "if @xmath49 symmetry is exact , the @xmath195 pentaquarks will not decay at all .",
    "this selection rule is exact in the symmetry limit .",
    "the narrow widths of the @xmath0 and @xmath23 pentaquarks come from the @xmath37 symmetry breaking .    using the picture of the flux tube model",
    ", we proposed that the @xmath196 pentaquark as the first candidate of the three - dimensional non - planar hadron with the extremely stable diamond structure .",
    "the up and down quarks lie at the corners of the diamond while the anti - strange quark sits in the center .",
    "various un - excited color flux tubes between the five quarks bind them into a stable and narrow color - singlet .",
    "such a configuration allows the lowest state having the negative parity naturally .",
    "the decay of the @xmath196 pentaquark into the nucleon and kaon requires the breakup of the non - planar diamond configuration into two conventional planar hadrons , which involves some kind of structural phase transition as in the condensed matter physics . despite",
    "that it lies above the kaon nucleon threshold , the width of the @xmath0 pentaquark should be narrow because of the mismatch between the initial and final state spatial wave functions .",
    "such a mechanism may be tested by future lattice qcd simulation using non - planar interpolating currents .",
    "the flavor wave functions of diquarks are listed in table [ tab - diquark ] .    .diquark flavor wave functions .",
    "@xmath197 , @xmath198 and @xmath199 are hypercharge , isospin and the third component of isospin respectively .",
    "the subscripts 1 and 2 represent two quarks inside the diquark . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the diquark is very similar to an anti - quark in many aspects except charge and baryon number .",
    "this feature leads to deep connection between pentaquarks and dibaryons which are composed of three diquarks @xcite .    for the @xmath47 dibaryons composed of three scalar diquarks with @xmath57 , its color wave function is anti - symmetric .",
    "its spin wave function is symmetric since diquarks are scalars .",
    "bose statistics requires the total wave function is symmetric .",
    "hence the product of the flavor and orbital wave function is anti - symmetric .",
    "suppose there is one orbital excitation between two diquarks : a and b. the flavor wave function of the diquark pair a and b must be symmetric , which is the same as in the @xmath58 pentaquarks . when the orbital wave function is mixed symmetric ( or anti - symmteric )",
    ", the flavor wave function must be mixed anti - symmteric ( or symmetric ) .",
    "this situation is very similar to the @xmath57 baryon multiplet in the @xmath49 @xmath200 representation .",
    "the only difference is that the diquark is a scalar .",
    "simple group theory tells us that the resulting @xmath47 dibaryons are in the @xmath201 representation . using the @xmath0 mass as input ,",
    "the negative baryons are estimated to be slightly above two baryon threshold @xcite .",
    "let s move on to those dibaryons which are composed of three diquarks and have no orbital excitation .",
    "three @xmath202 diquarks combine into a color singlet so their color wave function is antisymmetric .",
    "diquarks are scalars .",
    "they obey bose statistics .",
    "their total wave function should be symmetric . since there is no orbital excitation between scalar diquarks , their spin and spatial wave functions are symmetric .",
    "hence their flavor wave function must be totally anti - symmetric .",
    "i.e. , the resulting dibaryon is a @xmath115 singlet with positive parity , which is nothing but the h dibaryon proposed by jaffe long time ago @xcite .",
    "it s interesting to note that the @xmath123 pentaquark singlet is very similar to the h dibaryon . from the available experimental constraint on the h dibaryon binding energy ,",
    "one may estimate the singlet mass to be around @xmath203 mev , which is very probably low - lying in the framework of diquark model @xcite .",
    "the surprising discovery of pentaquarks shall be a milestone in the hadron spectroscopy , if these states are further established experimentally .",
    "perhaps , a new landscape is emerging on the horizon , of which we have only had a first glimpse through the above experiments .",
    "theorists have to answer the following fundamental questions :    * is the world composed of quarks and gluons as we are familiar with or a bunch of chiral solitons as indicated by the chiral soliton model ?",
    "* why are pentaquarks so different from conventional hadrons ?",
    "does @xmath0 carry positive or negative parity ?",
    "why is its width extremely small ? how to generate the low mass of @xmath0 pentaquark ?",
    "* does there exist strong correlation between light quarks ? does it play an essential role in lowering the mass of the pentaquark system ? *",
    "if so , what s the underlying dynamics leading to the strong correlation ? is such a dynamics and correlation particular to the pentaquark system or universal ? * are there other `` genuine '' hadrons with valence quark ( anti - quark ) number @xmath204 , in which quarks do not form two or more color - singlet clusters such as hadronic molecules or nuclei ? * is there an upper limit for @xmath132 ? in our universe , there may exist quark stars where the quark number is huge .",
    "is there a gap in @xmath132 from pentaquark states to quark stars ?",
