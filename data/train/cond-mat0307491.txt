    "semiclassical gravity has played a central role in theoretical physics .",
    "phenomena such as the hawking effect or cosmological particle production are commonly considered to be crucial first steps on the way to building up a consistent fully - quantum theory of gravity ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "however a fundamental limit to these investigations is imposed by the fact that their most basic description is based on linear qft on a fixed ( classical ) continuum spacetime .",
    "several theoretical approaches have been developed to overcome this limitation : in a fashion that we can call `` top - down '' , string models [ brane models ] have in some special situations developed a high energy description of the hawking effect  @xcite , while `` bottom - up '' approaches , based on stochastic gravity and the einstein  langevin analysis of particle creation by a gravitational field , have in recent years provided further insight @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the physics community has so far lacked any possibility for direct experimental tests of these ideas .",
    "indeed this lack of experimental guidance is a severe hindrance with respect to further developments in semiclassical gravity ( or full - fledged quantum gravity for that matter ) .",
    "in particular we have no _ experimental _ guidance regarding the manner in which the predictions of curved spacetime quantum field theory are changed once the hypotheses of non - discreteness and/or a non - fluctuating background are relaxed . in this regard",
    "the analogue models of gravity developed in recent years can be considered a first attempt to create an arena which can serve as a theoretical , and possibly observational , laboratory to test aspects of these scenarios .",
    "no experimental set up has yet been realized in which the predictions of analogue models can be observationally tested .",
    "nevertheless theoretical analyses of analogue models  @xcite have been so far remarkably successful in teaching us how semiclassical gravity phenomena are sensitive to possible quantum gravity effects , such as , for example , modified ( lorentz violating ) dispersion relations  @xcite .",
    "( see for example the trans - planckian problem in the hawking effect @xcite and in cosmology @xcite . )",
    "what we intend to discuss in this article is a particular class of experiment that we hope could be realized in the very near future wherein certain analogue gravity model predictions could be tested .",
    "the interest in doing so would not just be that of confirming a now well - established theoretical prediction , but mainly trying to evince deviations from the naive theoretical predictions due to the intrinsic discrete nature of the experimental system and/or to the possible role of non - linearities .",
    "we shall focus our attention on the analogue gravity system established by the propagation of linearized phase perturbations in a bose - einstein condensate  @xcite .",
    "in particular we shall consider an experiment where a time - varying scattering length is used to simulate the cosmological expansion of the universe , and its associated quantum creation of particles .",
    "it is interesting to note that in reference  @xcite the authors proposed an explanation of the so called `` bosenova '' phenomenon  @xcite ( a controlled instability of the bulk condensate induced by a sign variation of the scattering length ) through a particular implementation of a version of analog cosmological particle production . in that approach the entire bulk of the condensate",
    "is rendered unstable and suffers catastrophic breakdown .",
    "our current paper takes a complementary approach : instead of trying to explain an observed phenomenon via analog cosmological particle production , we shall instead consider the most favourable conditions to observe it  preferably without violent disruption of the entire condensate",
    ".    the scheme of the paper will be as follows : in the next section we will review the physics of becs regarding its analogue gravity features .",
    "section iii will be devoted to the discussion of how to simulate a frw universe within a bec .",
    "there exist two main routes to do this .",
    "one considers an explosive expansion of the condensate ; the other makes use of the possibility of tuning the strength of the interaction between the different bosons in the condensate .",
    "this latter route will be the main concern of this paper .    in section iv we",
    "will first qualitatively describe how the modification of the interaction strength ( encoded in the value of the scattering length ) yields cosmological particle creation .",
    "next , in subsection a we will discuss [ in the context of current bec technology ] whether there exists a regime in which this particle creation process can actually be reproduced .",
    "we will see that there is a limit on the rapidity of change of the background configuration , associated with the need to enforce a `` markov approximation '' , in order for the whole construction to make sense .",
    "however , this bound still leaves a lot of parameter space available to look for the particle creation effect .",
    "subsection b reviews the cosmological particle creation process , emphasizing the particular features of bec systems .",
    "then , subsection c discuss the actual observability of the effect .",
    "finally , we conclude with a short summary and discussion .",
    "bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) have recently become subject of extensive study as possible analogue models of general relativity @xcite .",
    "in particular it was shown that the propagation of phase perturbations in a bec can under certain conditions closely mimic the dynamics of quantum fields in curved spacetimes . in previous papers we noted that a varying scattering length in the bec system corresponds to a varying speed of light in the `` effective metric '' @xcite .",
    "recent experiments have indeed achieved a controlled tuning of the scattering length in rubidium 85 @xcite .",
    "the effect is powerful enough to lead to large non - perturbative changes in the effective metric .",
    "let us start by very briefly reviewing the derivation of the acoustic metric for a bec system .    in the dilute gas approximation , one can describe a bose gas through a quantum field @xmath0 satisfying @xmath1 here @xmath2 parameterizes the strength of the interactions between the different bosons in the gas",
    ". it can be re - expressed in terms of the scattering length as @xmath3 as usual , the quantum field can be separated into a macroscopic ( classical ) condensate and a fluctuation : @xmath4 , with @xmath5 .",
    "then , by adopting the self - consistent mean field approximation @xcite @xmath6 one can arrive at the set of coupled equations : @xmath7 @xmath8 here @xmath9 the equation for the classical wave function of the condensate is closed only when the back - reaction effect due to the fluctuations are neglected .",
    "( this back - reaction is hiding in the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 . )",
    "this is the approximation contemplated by the gross - pitaevskii equation . in general one will have to solve both equations simultaneously .    adopting the madelung representation for the wave function of the condensate @xmath12,\\ ] ] and defining an irrotational `` velocity field '' by @xmath13 ,",
    "the gross - pitaevskii equation can be rewritten as a continuity equation plus an euler equation : @xmath14 these equations are completely equivalent to those of an irrotational and inviscid fluid apart from the existence of the so - called quantum potential @xmath15 , which has the dimensions of an energy .",
    "note that @xmath16 = \\nabla_j \\left [   -{\\hbar^2\\over4 m } \\ ; n_c \\ ; \\nabla_i \\nabla_j \\ln n_c   \\right],\\ ] ] which justifies the introduction of the so - called quantum stress tensor @xmath17 this tensor has the dimensions of pressure , and may be viewed as an intrinsically quantum anisotropic pressure contributing to the euler equation .",
    "if we write the mass density of the madelung fluid as @xmath18 , and use the fact that the flow is irrotational then the euler equation takes the form @xmath19   + \\rho \\ ; \\bnabla \\left[\\frac{v_{ext}(t,\\x)}{m } \\right ] + \\bnabla   \\left[{\\g \\rho^2\\over 2 m^2}\\right ] + \\bnabla \\cdot \\sigma^{\\rm quantum } = 0 .",
    "\\label{e : euler2}\\ ] ] note that the term @xmath20 has the dimensions of specific enthalpy , while @xmath21 represents a bulk pressure .",
    "when the gradients in the density of the condensate are small one can neglect the quantum stress term leading to the standard hydrodynamic approximation . because the flow is irrotational ,",
    "the euler equation is often more conveniently written in hamilton ",
    "jacobi form : @xmath22    apart from the wave function of the condensate itself , we also have to account for the [ typically small ] quantum perturbations of the system ( [ quantum - field ] ) .",
    "these quantum perturbations can be described in several different ways , here we are interested in the `` quantum acoustic representation '' @xmath23 where @xmath24 are real quantum fields . by using this representation equation ( [ quantum - field ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath25 here @xmath26 represents a second - order differential operator obtained from linearizing the quantum potential . explicitly : @xmath27\\ ; \\widehat n_1 + \\half   n_c^{-1/2 } \\;\\nabla^2 ( n_c^{-1/2}\\ ; \\widehat n_1 ) . % \\nonumber\\\\&&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the equations we have just written can be obtained easily by linearizing the gross - pitaevskii equation around a classical solution : @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "it is important to realize that in those equations the back - reaction of the quantum fluctuations on the background solution has been assumed negligible .",
    "we also see in those equations , ( [ pt1 ] ) and ( [ pt2 ] ) , that time variations of @xmath30 and time variations of the scattering length @xmath31 appear to act in very different ways .",
    "whereas the external potential only influences the background equation  ( [ e : hj ] ) [ and hence the acoustic metric in the analog description ] , the scattering length directly influences both the perturbation and background equations .    from the previous equations for the linearized perturbations it is possible to derive a wave equation for @xmath32 ( or alternatively , for @xmath33 ) .",
    "all we need is to substitute in equation  ( [ pt1 ] ) the @xmath33 obtained from equation  ( [ pt2 ] ) .",

    "then , the solution for @xmath63 can be obtained from ( [ e : hj ] ) @xmath64 and it requires an external potential of the form @xmath65 one could certainly construct such a potential in a `` sufficiently large '' region around @xmath66 ; this would correspond to a `` sufficiently large '' part of a homogeneous and flat frw universe . outside this region",
    ", the potential will have in practice some confining walls .",
    "the final effective metric can be written as @xmath67 with @xmath68 so finally we end up with a frw universe whose proper friedmann time , @xmath69 , is related to the laboratory time , @xmath57 , by @xmath70 .",
    "although this explosion route seems promising , one should note that this analog models has substantial drawbacks .",
    "in particular it is easy to see from equation  ( [ eq : theta - ex ] ) that one would get for the condensate a linearly rising velocity field @xmath71 .",
    "hence this particular realization of a frw effective geometry is guaranteed to possess an apparent horizon , a spherical surface in which the speed of the fluid surpasses the speed of sound . from a dynamical point of view",
    ", this might introduce many practical problems not intrinsically inherent to the type of geometries we are trying to reproduce .",
    "because of this , we view the use of an exploding medium as not being the preferred route for building an analogue for an expanding frw universe .",
    "( for an alternate view , where the explosion route is the primary focus of attention , see  @xcite . )",
    "another way to reproduce cosmologically expanding configurations in , we think , a cleaner fashion is by taking advantage of the possibility to change the value of the scattering length offered by some becs  @xcite .",
    "let us note that in reference @xcite , the authors already used the existence of time dependence on the scattering length , in combination with a time dependent external potential , to create explosive configuration of the type described in previous subsection . here",
    ", we are going to use this variability with a different strategy .",
    "let us again start from ( [ fluid - geometry ] ) but now with @xmath72 at all times : @xmath73 then , it is not difficult to envisage a situation in which @xmath74 is constant in a `` sufficiently large '' region ( think of a `` sufficiently large '' close - to - hard - walled box ) .",
    "then , the continuity equation is directly satisfied and the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation tells us that with a fixed external potential the phase function @xmath63 will depend only on @xmath57 adapting itself to the changes of @xmath75 . changing",
    "the scattering length with time directly causes changes in the value of the propagation speed @xmath76 .",
    "( that temporal changes in the velocity of sound can be interpreted as a cosmological expansion without invoking any sort of velocity in the medium has already been suggested in  @xcite in the context of superfluid helium . )",
    "we now define @xmath77^{1/2 } dt$ ] and write @xmath78 where @xmath79 in this model an expansion corresponds to a decrease of the scattering length and vice versa .",
    "the hubble function for this spacetime is @xmath80 ( the prime represents derivative with respect friedmann time , the dot derivative with respect laboratory time ) .",
    "this is the model we will consider in the following discussion .",
    "let us now present a qualitative explanation of how is that we can closely simulate cosmological particle creation within this model",
    ". we can start with a condensate in a stationary state described , in a sufficiently large volume , by a constant background density @xmath74 and a phase function linear in time , @xmath81 .",
    "this is a solution of the gp equation . for this",
    ", one needs to have a potential that reproduces a large enough close - to - hard - walled box and that satisfies the condition @xmath82 .",
    "apart from this classical background , there will be some quantum fluctuations over it . at temperatures",
    "much below the critical temperature these quantum fluctuations are very small and can be described by the bogoliubov equations .",
    "( these quantum fluctuations are present even at zero temperature owing to the so - called quantum depletion phenomenon , see for example  @xcite . )",
    "let us consider that these quantum fluctuations are in their vacuum state .",
    "if one now decreases the value of the scattering length in a sufficiently slow manner ( this issue will be discussed bellow ) , all the individual bosons ( this is only an approximate concept in an interacting theory ) will be affected in the same way .",
    "this means that the value of the background magnitudes these are the coherent magnitudes will be slowly modified .",
    "the gp equation tells you that the density function @xmath74 will be kept fixed while the phase function will develop a non - trivial dependence with time . at the same time",
    "the value of the speed of sound will decrease .",
    "now , apart from the background configuration , what happens with the additional quantum fluctuations ?",
    "the equation satisfied by the quantum fluctuations is , in the acoustic approximation ( that is , for long wavelengths ) that of a massless minimally coupled scalar field over an expanding background and therefore , it will yield cosmological pair production of particles .    an interesting point to notice",
    "is that varying the external potential by this we mean changing with time the value of the external potential , @xmath83 , in the central homogeneous region changes the background configuration in the same manner as varying the scattering length does .",
    "however , as the speed of sound does not depend on the external potential , its variations will not lead to cosmological particle creation .",
    "now , what can we say about the observability of the particle production process ?",
    "the standard technique to `` see '' phonons is tomographic imaging .",
    "one opens the trap and looks at the expansion of the condensate .",
    "phonons correspond to distributions for the momentum of the atoms in the trap and different momenta correspond to different travel distances of the atoms after you switch of the trap .",
    "taking snapshots of this evolution shows the density contrasts and then the original momentum distribution .",
    "if the wave function @xmath84 is split into the condensate wave function @xmath85 plus quantum excitations @xmath86 ( in this situation , we mean atoms ) then , the density you observe is @xmath87 as @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , the observability of the effect will depend on the value of the ratio @xmath89 or more simply on the spatially integrated ratio @xmath90 if this quantity is of order unity ( say 1/2 or 1/10 ) then phonons can probably be `` seen '' ; if it is 1/100 then seeing phonons is technologically difficult . if the particle production process was so strong that the calculation of @xmath91 resulted on values close to unity or higher , this would indicate that the bogoliubov mean field approximation would have been violated , and the bec itself disrupted .",
    "let us now perform some explicit calculations of the particle production expected in realistic situations with present - day becs in which the scattering length @xmath31 is changed in time from some initial value to a different final value .",
    "we first have to know how quickly we can drive these temporal changes while still ensuring that the different approximations involved in the analysis remain valid .",
    "the previous analysis shows that in order to consider particle creation driven by a time - varying scattering length we must be sure to work in a regime where the background is `` instantaneously '' reacting to the changes in @xmath31 .",
    "moreover the very derivation of the effective metric description is based on the gp equation which we then want to make sure holds at each instant of time .",
    "so we must first determine the upper bound on the rapidity of the change in the scattering length @xmath31 which still permits the gp equation to hold .",
    "this will also give an upper bound for the frequencies of the quasi - particles that might be created ( if @xmath69 is the shortest timescale over which we can drive the system then @xmath92 is the largest frequency of the quasi - particle we can create ) .",
    "the validity of the gp in describing the bose - einstein condensate is related to the validity of several crucial assumptions which permit us to perform certain approximations on the fundamental multi - particle hamiltonian description .",
    "the relevant approximations are generally stated to be the `` mean - field '' approximation and the dilute gas approximation .",
    "it is nevertheless important to note that in a dynamical situation a third approximation , which we can call `` markovian '' approximation , is implicitly assumed .",
    "let us review the meaning and implications of these approximations : the mean field approximation is based on the assumption that most of the atoms are in the condensate phase and that the influence of the non condensed fraction can be neglected .",
    "this implies that significant creation of quasi - particles with excessive energies can be dangerous .",
    "in particular from the bogoliubov dispersion relation  @xcite @xmath93 we can deduce that excitation of quasi - particles with wavelengths comparable to the healing length would led to free particle states ( for @xmath94 ; @xmath95 ; @xmath96 ) .",
    "this argument seems to imply that one should require the typical timescale for the change in @xmath31 to be no shorter than the healing time .",
    "( which is the analogue in this situation of the planck time in quantum gravity . )",
    "the dilute gas approximation is instead related to the way the interaction potential is simplified in the gp equation .",
    "this approximation is valid if @xmath97 , so we shall have to keep the amplitude of the changes in @xmath98 small in order to satisfy this bound .",
    "we wish to emphasise that the dilute gas approximation does not appear to be a crucial approximation for the analog gravity picture to hold .",
    "as long as the interaction term @xmath99 can be generalized to be some higher order ( but still local ) term @xmath100 an analog gravity description is not precluded ( see , for example  @xcite ) .",
    "finally the markovian approximation is related to the fact that in dynamical situations the two - body time - dependent scattering matrix can have a complicated form due to the `` memory '' of the system ( see e.g. section iv - a of the paper by khler and burnett  @xcite ) .",
    "basically in these situations the system is described by a gp - like equation where the interaction term includes a `` delay term '' described by an integration over different times . the necessary assumption in order to have a markovian description of the dynamics ( which together with the two previous approximations leads to the gp equation ) is then that the timescales on which external parameters are changing are longer that the two - body collisional duration .",
    "that is , longer than the timescale over which a single interaction happens .",
    "( reduced to the bare bones , we are asking that the scattering length does not change significantly during the period when a pair of atoms are interacting . )",
    "we can estimate the two - body collisional time by a simple calculation .",
    "all we need is the typical size of the region of strong interaction of two atoms in the condensate and the typical speed with which they move .",
    "the first quantity can be assumed to be of the order of the van der waals scale length : the inter - atomic potential @xmath101 is characterized by a short - range region of strong chemical bonding and a long - range van der waals potential , @xmath102 this leads to a van der waals scale length  @xcite , @xmath103 this length is basically the size of the region of strong interaction : for @xmath104 the scattering wave function oscillates rapidly due to the strong interaction potential . in alkali ground state interactions , @xmath105 is the same for all hyperfine states of a given atomic pair ; consequently , @xmath106 is the same for all collision channels .",
    "for example in the case of na@xmath107 , it is about 2.4 nm . we shall assume here generically @xmath108 nm .    regarding the typical speed of the atoms ,",
    "this is set by the de broglie momentum generated by the trap confinement : @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "we shall assume a trap of typical size of ten microns .",
    "we then get @xmath111 we now confront this quantity with the timescale we have to be faster than in order to create modes with wavelengths shorter than the condensate size @xmath112 .",
    "this is @xmath113 .",
    "so @xmath114 for typical bec systems @xmath115m@xmath116 m ( assuming that the scattering length ranges from one to a hundred nanometers ) so @xmath117 note that @xmath118 can be computed to be @xmath119 so a microsecond is the shortest timescale allowed for the change in @xmath31 .",
    "note that this interaction time is shorter than the healing time @xmath120@xmath121 which plays the role of the `` planck time '' in this system .",
    "thus the gp equation is valid in the entire `` sub - healing '' regime , which is the primary regime of interest , and continues to hold well into the `` trans - healing '' regime ( although the previous comments regarding the breakdown of the mean - field approximation in this regime remain valid ) .",
    "now that we have estimated how fast the change in the scattering length can be driven , we can propose a particular time dependence and derive an estimate for the relative production of phonons .",
    "particle production in an expanding universe has been extensively studied in the framework of semiclassical gravity  ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in this regard",
    "the scope of this subsection will be to present an example of these calculations to non specialists as well as to evaluate the experimental feasibility of an experimental test .    as a test - bed we shall choose a slightly simplified version of parker s model  @xcite .",
    "the frw metric with flat spatial sections can be alternatively written as @xmath122 in which we are using for convenience a special type of pseudotime @xmath123 with @xmath124 .",
    "the scale factor is independent of @xmath125 hence the mode decomposition for the quantum scalar field can be written as @xmath126 where the @xmath127 are solutions of the equation @xmath128 that satisfy the normalization condition @xmath129 imagine now that the scale factor @xmath130 undergoes a finite amount of expansion in a monotonic fashion .",
    "this means that the scale factor passes from and initial value @xmath131 at @xmath132 to a final value @xmath133 at @xmath134 ( or what is the same , that the scattering length passes from and initial value @xmath135 to a final value @xmath136 ) .",
    "spacetime can be approximated at early times and at late times respectively by two different minkowski spacetimes . as is standard",
    ", we will assume that the quantum scalar field is initially in the vacuum state associated to the initial minkowski spacetime .",
    "then , we want to calculate the particle content of this state in the final minkowski spacetime .",

    "after a brief discussion of these regimes we shall deal with the full intermediate case .",

    ", this means that the change is so fast that the entire acoustic regime is excited ( the time rate is trans - healing ) , but sufficiently slowly that the gp equation still continues to hold ( the time rate is still sub - interaction ) .",
    "however we shall still have to put in `` by hand '' a high momentum cut off , given by the healing length @xmath161 , because beyond this point we can not trust the dispersion relation to remain on the acoustic branch implicit in our calculation .",
    "the relevant calculation can be preformed by simply considering the mathematical @xmath162 limit in parker s model .",
    "indeed the @xmath163 and @xmath164 coefficients are now momentum independent and @xmath165 @xmath166 as should be expected , particle production in this sudden limit depends only on the change in the scale factor .",
    "the particle production spectrum is now flat ( more precisely , phase space limited ) all the way up to the healing frequency .",
    "a rigorous result is that for _ any _ monotonic change in @xmath137 from @xmath131 to @xmath133 the magnitudes of the @xmath163 and @xmath164 coefficients are less than or equal to those calculated for the sudden approximation  @xcite  consequently the sudden approximation provides an absolute upper bound on particle production .",
    "the number of phonons produced is @xmath167 that is @xmath168 the good news for current purposes is that this scales as @xmath169 . now",
    "the trap size @xmath112 is of order 10 microns , while the healing length is in the range from 1 to 0.1 micrometers ; thus @xmath170 to @xmath171 .",
    "a prefactor this big is desirable in terms of producing an observable effect . as for @xmath31 ( scattering length ) , this can range from 100  nm to 1  nm , so the ratio @xmath172 is up to @xmath173 .",
    "since @xmath174 ( scale factor ) is @xmath175 we have @xmath176 up to @xmath177 .",
    "therefore @xmath178 which is of order one",
    " so there is no enormous suppression coming from the bogoliubov factor .",
    "all in all , we estimate that @xmath179 to @xmath180 phonons can be produced in the sudden approximation .",
    "in contrast , when the parameter @xmath181 is large compared with unity ( that is , for large enough momenta ) , and provided @xmath182 , we have @xmath183 this is a correctly normalized planckian [ black body ] distribution .",
    "we can associate a temperature @xmath184 to the final phonon content produced by the expansion . before doing that ,",
    "let us write down some useful relations between the frequencies associated with the pseudotime @xmath185 and with the laboratory time @xmath57 .",
    "asymptotically ( either in the infinite past or in the infinite future ) the relation between the times @xmath57 and @xmath185 is given by @xmath186 so that @xmath187 here , the upper indices indicate with respect to which time a frequency is defined , and the sub - scripts @xmath188 and @xmath189 identify whether a particular magnitude is evaluated in the initial or in the final configuration .",
    "now it is easy to see that the laboratory temperature that we would associate to the final configuration in the adiabatic approximation is @xmath190 in order to estimate this temperature we need to convert the time scale over which the scattering length changes , @xmath191 from the pseudo time to the laboratory time . to do this",
    "we define @xmath192 for the particular profile , equation  ( [ eq : prof ] ) , that associated with this model equation  ( [ t - eta - rel ] ) evaluates to @xmath193 if we use this relation between @xmath194 and @xmath158 , the temperature would be @xmath195 in this way we check the intuitive idea that in the expansion process one would create phonons with frequencies inversely related with the temporal scale of change of the configuration in laboratory .",
    "the number of phonons in the final state is @xmath196    contrary to what happens in the sudden approximation , the adiabatic approximation is taking into account the rapidity with which the configuration changes .",
    "thus , the total number of phonons calculated by trusting the adiabatic approximation throughout the whole range of frequencies is suppressed with respect to the sudden approximation calculation by a factor of @xmath197 times @xmath198 ^ 3 $ ]  this factor consisting of a dimensionless number coming from the detailed expression for the integral , times the cubed ratio of the healing time in the condensate to the time over which the scattering length is forced to change .",
    "with @xmath199 we still get somewhere between @xmath200 and @xmath201 phonons .",
    "once @xmath202 this is reduced to somewhere between @xmath203 and @xmath200 phonons ; but in this case we will also run into problems from finite volume effects  @xmath194 is then comparable to the sound crossing time for the condensate and the momentum space delta functions appearing above are smeared out due to the finite volume of the condensate .",
    "( this point is carefully addressed in a rather different physical context in  @xcite , though many of the mathematical manipulations appearing therein are very similar to the present situation . )",
    "note that as @xmath204 the adiabatic approximation calculation still results in one order of magnitude less than the equivalent calculation with the sudden approximation .",
    "moreover , in this case , the whole range of observable phonons ( with frequencies between the healing frequency and the trap frequency ) is beyond the strict range of applicability of the adiabatic approximation ( remember that @xmath205 ) .",
    "therefore , to be more precise one will have to make an intermediate analysis , in between the sudden and the adiabatic regimes .",
    "let us estimate the value of the temperatures associated with the adiabatic approximation for temporal scales of change within the observable window . from equation ( [ temperature ] )",
    "we can see that this temperature will be @xmath206 , and so , for @xmath194 between @xmath207  s ( associated with the condensate size ) and @xmath208  s ( the shortest timescale compatible with the acoustic approximation associated with the initial configuration ) will range from @xmath38  nk to @xmath209  nk . from this estimate",
    "we can already see that , by modifying the scattering length on time scales close to the healing time , one could produce a bath of ( almost ) thermal phonons so energetic that even the mean field approximation might break down ( causing the complete disruption of the condensate ) .",
    "when the peak frequency tends toward the healing frequency we see that the low frequency part of the observable spectrum will develop important departures from thermality .",
    "we shall now turn to the general intermediate case and describe the full spectrum of phonons created in our toy model . then",
    ", we will discuss the observability of the cosmological particle creation effect in terms of the ratio @xmath91 defined in equation ( [ c - ratio ] ) .",

    "this can be reasonably be varied in the proximity of a feshbach resonance from 1  nm to 100  nm . for an experiment with heavy alkali atoms ( e.g. rubidium ) the speed of sound will then typically range from few mm / s to 10  mm / s .",

    "therefore , by implementing in laboratory an expansive process with @xmath194 in an intermediate regime , in between the healing times @xmath251 associated with the initial configuration ( @xmath252 seconds ) and the final configuration ( @xmath253 seconds ) , one should be able to observe the effect .",
    "in this work we have discussed the possibilities that becs offer for simulating lorentzian geometries of the cosmological type in the laboratory .",
    "there are two inequivalent paths one can follow in this task . the first one is based on provoking an expansive explosion in the condensate by changing with time the characteristic frequency of an isotropic and harmonic confining potential .",
    "this option implies that the velocity profile of the condensate acquires arbitrarily high values at large distances from the center .",
    "so there is always a sphere at which the velocity of the expanding bec would surpass its sound velocity : a sonic horizon would be formed . in practice , due to the fact that physically realizable becs are finite systems , one can only reproduce on them a portion of an expanding universe .",
    "therefore one might argue that the sonic horizon would be formed outside the bec .",
    "however , the velocity of sound in becs is so small ( a few mm / s ) that in practical situations the sonic horizon will be formed well inside the system . now",
    "the existence of sonic horizons is certainly interesting in its own right , but is not inherent to the simulation of cosmological spacetimes .",
    "moreover , the plausible dynamical instabilities associated with their formation could mask the observation of purely cosmological effects .",
    "the alternative path to simulating a cosmological geometry that we have pursued in this article is to take advantage of the possibility of varying the scattering length or , what is the same , the interaction strength between the atoms in the condensate . in this case",
    ", what we need is a confining potential with a sufficiently large almost flat minimum in which a portion of the condensate stays at rest . in this configuration",
    ", there is no formation of sonic horizons and thus we think it is ( both conceptually and technically ) a much cleaner path to follow .",
    "the description of the condensation phenomenon naturally involves the separation of the system into a `` classical '' wave function ( the condensate part ) and quantum fluctuations . in the acoustic approximation",
    "we can think of these quantum fluctuations as phonons over a classical background geometry , in this case , the analogue of a cosmological spacetime .",
    "therefore , we can use the tuning of the scattering length to simulate not only a classical cosmologically expanding universe , but the quantum phenomenon of cosmological particle creation .",
    "we have analyzed this well known process by using a minor variant of parker s model for a finite amount of expansion  @xcite .",
    "then , by working with numerical estimates appropriate to currently accessible becs in dilute gases , we have presented an analysis of the feasibility of observing the effect in real experiments .",
    "we have seen that there is a more than plausible window for the observability of the effect with current technology . in current becs",
    "the scattering length can easily be varied from a 100  nm to 1  nm .",
    "this produces an expansion in the geometrical scale factor of about three times .",
    "the temporal scale of change of the scattering length can not be arbitrarily short .",
    "it has to be slower than the time scale in which the interaction between two atoms proceeds .",
    "we have calculated this time scale to be of the order of microseconds .",
    "however , we have also seen that , by driving the previous finite amount of expansion in a temporal scale of change of about fractions of millisecond , one could start to detect the presence of cosmological particle creation . from here",
    "one could shorten the time scale down to tens of microsecond progressively amplifying the expected effect . by the time one reaches tens of microseconds the effect would have been amplified by a factor of a hundred , ( with timescale still above the interaction time ) , opening even the possibility of totally disrupting the condensate .",
    "the relevant temporal scales of change for the effect to be observable are of the order of the healing time in the condensate .",
    "therefore we expect that apart from the phonon spectrum calculated by neglecting the modified dispersion relations at high energies , there will be also some production of quasiparticles . to observe the purely cosmological effect one would have to keep this quasiparticle production under a certain level ; thus , the temporal scale of change should not be driven significantly beyond the healing time .    in our analysis",
    "we have neglected finite volume effects .",
    "however we shall now show that these effects are insignificant for the typical condensate we considered here .",
    "the fractional change in the number of particles produced due to finite volume effects is expected to be of order @xmath254=(cutoff wavelength)/(@xmath255size of the condensate ) .",
    "the ratio between the healing length and the bec thomas  fermi radius can be expressed as a ratio between the harmonic trap length and the scattering length .",
    "@xmath256 for a harmonic oscillator length of about @xmath257 microns , @xmath258 atoms and a scattering length of 1 nanometer one gets @xmath259 . for a scattering length ten",
    "times larger ( easily achievable with a feshbach resonance and still compatible with @xmath260 ) and @xmath261 m one would get @xmath262 .",
    "this implies that @xmath263 and hence finite volume effects are negligible .    to conclude ,",
    "our analysis suggest that it should be already possible to observe the process of cosmological particle creation in bec analogue systems , by changing the scattering length from an initial value of about 100  nm to a final value of about 1  nm on times scales shorter than milliseconds but larger than tens of microseconds .",

    "<S> bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) have recently been the subject of considerable study as possible analogue models of general relativity . in particular it was shown that the propagation of phase perturbations in a bec can , under certain conditions , closely mimic the dynamics of scalar quantum fields in curved spacetimes . in two previous articles [ gr - qc/0110036 , gr - qc/0305061 ] we noted that a varying scattering length in the bec corresponds to a varying speed of light in the `` effective metric '' . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments have indeed achieved a controlled tuning of the scattering length in rubidium 85 . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we shall discuss the prospects for the use of this particular experimental effect to test some of the predictions of semiclassical quantum gravity , for instance , particle production in an expanding universe . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that these effects are generally much larger than the hawking radiation expected from causal horizons , and so there are much better chances for their detection in the near future .    </S>",
