    "the nature of the dark energy has been seen as one of the principal puzzles in cosmology , and in theoretical physics as a whole , ever since the supernova observations @xcite in 1998 confirmed the mounting suspicion that the expansion rate of the universe is accelerating .",
    "one of the leading contenders is the cosmological constant , for which the equation of state @xmath2 equals @xmath7 , both on theoretical grounds and because no confirmed deviations from @xmath5 have come from cosmological observations .",
    "however , the current phase of accelerated expansion is most likely not the only one in the history of the universe : it is thought that a much earlier epoch of accelerated expansion called inflation created the initial fluctuations that led to large - scale structure and solved several problems of the standard big bang cosmology .",
    "the spectrum of fluctuations that we observe today , particularly in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , indicates that they were created by a mechanism that was able to act outside the normal causal horizon @xcite .",
    "it is commonly believed that the structure we see in the cmb and in the distribution of galaxies arose from quantum fluctuations that were stretched outside the hubble horizon by a phase of accelerated expansion , not dissimilar to the one that is being observed today .",
    "we know that inflation ended early in cosmic history , before the epoch of big bang nucleosynthesis : an inflating universe is nearly empty of matter and does not form galaxies . as a consequence , inflation could not have been driven by a pure cosmological constant . since the universe apparently began to inflate again several billion years ago",
    ", it is natural to ask whether hypothetical observers present during primordial inflation would have been able to distinguish between a cosmological constant and an alternative model such as a scalar field by studying the expansion history quantified by @xmath2 . in this paper",
    ", we will link the usual inflationary observables to @xmath2 and provide constraints on @xmath2 during the period when the observable scales left the horizon .",
    "we assume that inflation started well before the observable scales left the horizon , i.e. , that it lasted longer than about 60 e - folds of expansion , so that the only significant contribution to the energy density @xmath8 is the one from the inflaton itself and that the universe can be taken to be spatially flat .",
    "this implies that the friedmann and energy conservation equations are h^2 & = & , + & = & -3 h(1+w ) .",
    "here we used the reduced planck mass , @xmath9 in our units where @xmath10 , and the hubble parameter @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the scale factor .",
    "we can compute the equation of state parameter @xmath13 once we know the expansion rate @xmath14 , 1+w = - .",
    "[ eq : wh ] it is of course equally possible to compute @xmath2 directly from the pressure and the energy density of the inflaton .",
    "however , the form given above is especially useful in the case of single - field inflation , in which case the perturbations generated are linked to @xmath14 as there is only a single degree of freedom present ( exemplified by the potential of the inflaton field ) .",
    "this allows us to connect the expression for @xmath2 directly to quantities related to the perturbations .",
    "this turns out to be especially simple when working with the slow - roll parameters in the so - called hamilton ",
    "jacobi formalism , see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite for detailed derivations .",
    "the first two slow - roll parameters are defined as _ h & = & 2 m_^2()^2 , + _ h & = & 2 m_^2 . here @xmath15 denotes a derivative with respect to the scalar field @xmath16 . since @xmath17 and @xmath18 , we find together with eq .",
    "( [ eq : wh ] ) that 1+w = _ h .",
    "the equation of state during inflation is therefore directly given by the first slow - roll parameter .",
    "to lowest order in slow - roll this is also related to the tensor to scalar ratio by @xmath19 . without any further work we can deduce that ,",
    "since primordial gravitational waves have not been observed , there is no observational requirement for a deviation from @xmath5 during inflation .",
    "the upper limit on @xmath1 from the five - year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data for a flat @xmath20cdm model without running is about @xmath21 @xcite , corresponding to a maximum deviation from @xmath5 of @xmath22",
    ". we will derive precise numerical constraints in the next section .",
    "decreases only slightly to @xmath23 . ]",
    "this result is at first glance a bit puzzling : an equation of state @xmath5 leads to de sitter expansion which in turn creates a scale - invariant harrison ",
    "zeldovich ( hz ) spectrum .",
    "however , the wmap five - year data paper also claims a 2.5 sigma deviation from a hz spectrum .",
    "the explanation is that the deviation of the scalar spectral index @xmath0 from the hz case ( @xmath6 ) can be caused by the second slow - roll parameter @xmath24 , given to lowest order in slow roll by 2_h = ( n_s-1 + 4_h ) .",
    "[ eq : ns ] thus even if at a given time @xmath25 , it is still possible to obtain @xmath26 through a non - zero @xmath24 .",
    "a non - zero @xmath24 implies that @xmath2 will evolve away from @xmath7 .",
    "how quickly will it do that ?",
    "possibly fast enough to lead to measurable deviations during the observable number of @xmath27-foldings ?",
    "we find = = 2 ( _ h-_h ) [ eq : wconst ] where @xmath28 is the number of @xmath27-foldings .",
    "since the rate of change of @xmath29 is proportional to @xmath29 itself , it can become very small if @xmath29 is very small .",
    "close to de sitter the field freezes and moves only very slowly , but even this slow motion leads to observable effects in the power spectrum of the perturbations .",
    "this is unfortunately an observational channel that is not available for the contemporary dark energy .",
    "indeed , the ways in which we probe inflation and today s dark energy are very different : we have no way to constrain directly the expansion history during inflation , but we can see the spectrum of the curvature perturbations generated during this epoch . on the other hand , while we can observe directly the recent expansion history of the universe and infer the equation of the state of the dark energy , the fluctuations generated during the current bout of accelerated expansion are impossible to observe both because of their tiny predicted amplitude and because they become classical only when outside the current horizon .    the likelihood of a tiny value of @xmath29 has been hotly debated in the inflation literature ( e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) , since it would prevent direct detection of inflationary gravitational waves , e.g.  by a cmb polarization satellite mission @xcite . within the framework of the early large - field inflation models , such as monomial potentials ,",
    "a tiny @xmath29 and large @xmath24 would look rather unnatural , and hence the observed @xmath30 would suggest @xmath31 and @xmath32 , both well within current experimental bounds .",
    "however by contrast the paradigm of small - field models , such as hybrid inflation , motivated by the need to keep the field values small in a supergravity context , does suggest that @xmath29 must be extremely small at horizon crossing , thus indicating @xmath2 very close to @xmath7 .",
    "in order to obtain numerical constraints on @xmath2 during inflation , we need to link it to observational quantities . in this paper",
    "we will use the spectrum of the primordial fluctuations , as observed in the cmb .",
    "the link between @xmath2 and @xmath14 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wh ] ) is fundamental , failing to hold only if either the universe was very different from friedmannian during inflation or if there were other contributions to the expansion rate present .",
    "the first would invalidate the whole inflationary framework , while in the second case our @xmath2 would correspond to an effective total @xmath2 .    to go from @xmath14 to",
    "the primordial power spectrum requires a specific model .",
    "here we assume that inflation was due to a single canonical scalar field , though without making the common assumption of slow - roll .",
    "an interesting future project is to relax this condition by investigating a range of other models , for example k - inflation models with a different sound speed @xcite .",
    "while this may change quantitative limits on @xmath2 , we do not expect it to change the qualitative results .",
    "we also note that our model imposes the dominant energy condition @xmath33 by construction .    in order to compute @xmath14 during the observable range of scales",
    ", we use the module provided by lesgourgues and valkenburg ( lv ) @xcite which takes the slow - roll parameters at the pivot scale as an input .",
    "the pivot scale is fixed to be @xmath34/mpc ( roughly in the center of the observable range ) ; this is the scale at which the hubble parameter @xmath14 is expanded as a taylor series in @xmath35 , with the scale factor set to @xmath36 .",
    "we then approach the problem from two slightly different angles . to reconstruct the evolution of @xmath2 from the time when the observable scales left the horizon up to the end of inflation , we use the flow - equation formalism @xcite to derive the evolution of @xmath29 from the end of inflation to the observable scales . in this",
    "we proceed similarly to ref .",
    "@xcite by selecting ",
    "initial \" values for the first four slow - roll parameters at the end of inflation ( in fact we only choose three of them since @xmath29 is always equal to 1 ) and flowing them back 60 @xmath27-foldings using the flow equations .",
    "the values obtained at @xmath37 are then used to compute the observables using the lv module . the appropriate value of @xmath38 changes with the inflationary energy scale , and may be smaller in low energy scales models .",
    "but this does not impact our conclusions , since we are interested in the experimental constraints on @xmath2 around the scales that are directly probed by observations , and additionally , as our later results show , the constraints remain fairly constant over a range of @xmath38 .",
    "this allows us to avoid more sophisticated approaches to treating this uncertainty , as given for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", we do not really know what happened after the observable scales left the horizon , as we do not have any observations concerning that period .",
    "based on this reasoning , lesgourgues and valkenburg @xcite argued that considering only the observable scales makes it possible to work with a relatively low - order expansion of the scalar field potential without introducing artificial constraints .",
    "we use the module provided by lv to compute the observables in their framework and to compare the results with those from the flow - equation formalism .    in both cases we use cosmomc @xcite to perform a markov chain monte carlo exploration of the parameter space , which includes , depending on our method :    * the slow - roll parameters at @xmath39 , i.e. at the end of inflation , for our first approch ; the useful parameters at the pivot scale ( fixed at @xmath37 ) are computed by solving numerically the flow equations ; * the slow - roll parameters at the pivot scale directly for the second method .",
    "here we used the first four slow - roll parameters @xmath29 , @xmath24 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xcite with the following ranges ( at @xmath39 for the first method , and at the pivot scale for the second ) : @xmath42 $ ] ( fixed to 1.0 for the first method ) , and @xmath24 , @xmath43 , @xmath41 @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "cosmomc works together with camb @xcite to compute the cmb power spectrum and then uses the wmap five - year likelihood code @xcite .",
    "the inflationary power spectrum is calculated using the lesgourgues ",
    "valkenburg module which solves the perturbation mode equation .",
    "this setup allows us to compute chains of acceptable expansion histories during inflation .",
    "these were then mapped into chains of @xmath45 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : w_phi ] ) .    in principle fig .",
    "[ fig : w_phi ] already shows the constraints on the equation of state parameter during inflation .",
    "but , as is easily seen in the figure , @xmath16 moves more and more slowly as we approach @xmath5 , which makes the constraints difficult to interpret .",
    "a better representation is @xmath46 in terms of the number of @xmath27-foldings @xmath38 before the end of inflation , see fig .  [",
    "fig : w_n ] .",
    "however , in the lv formalism the field is never evolved until the end of inflation , so that @xmath38 is not defined .",
    "an alternative way to plot the results in this situation is to map them instead to the horizon scale at that epoch , @xmath47 . since the perturbations freeze in outside the horizon and",
    "turn into conserved curvature perturbations , this scale corresponds to the one that they have when they re - enter the horizon .",
    "we plot our constraints in this way in fig .",
    "[ fig : w_k ] .",
    "> from the full evolution in fig .",
    "[ fig : w_n ] we see that @xmath2 approaches @xmath7 rapidly as we move into the past",
    ". the precise rate at which @xmath7 is approached depends on the range of models chosen at the end of inflation ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) . nonetheless ,",
    "as shown in the inset , strong deviations from @xmath5 are expected in the last few e - folds .",
    "to illustrate the scales involved : if we were to arbitrarily place today at @xmath48 ( the right - hand limit of the inset ) and reverse time then @xmath39 would roughly correspond to last scattering ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the current experimental uncertainty on the dark energy @xmath2 is about @xmath50 , comfortably enclosing @xmath5 , and in the future will reach a precision of @xmath22 or better .",
    "we find that the current limits on @xmath2 during inflation are comparable , with a 95% limit of @xmath51 at @xmath52/mpc , see fig .",
    "[ fig : w_k ] .",
    "this agrees well with the arguments in the previous section , but the figure shows also the precise shape of the constraints .",
    "there is no lower limit on @xmath2 ( apart from @xmath53 enforced by the model construction ) .",
    "however , the tentative observation of a deviation from a scale - invariant primordial power spectrum implies through eq .",
    "( [ eq : ns ] ) that @xmath29 and @xmath24 can not both be zero .",
    "together with eq .",
    "( [ eq : wconst ] ) this disfavours a constant @xmath5 . but",
    "as discussed in section [ sec : eos ] , @xmath54 can remain small over the observable range of scales and we find that this deviation is not visible in the figures",
    ".    the limits on @xmath2 can be improved by extending the lever arm of the measurements , for example by adding galaxy survey data on smaller scales .",
    "we show the impact of using both wmap 5-year cmb data and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7 luminous red galaxy data ( dr7 lrg ) @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmbsdss ] .",
    "the shape of the constraints have not changed by much , but the limits have become somewhat tighter .",
    "we can achieve another small increase in precision by adding further cmb data on smaller scales , but again the improvement is small so we do not show those constraints .",
    "we also notice that the prescription of lv allows for a stronger variation of @xmath2 . the flow - equation formalism with the number of parameters and priors used here leads to very little evolution of @xmath2 during the observable period .",
    "this does not mean that one of the two approaches is wrong , but rather that they impose different additional conditions .",
    "as always , it is important to be aware of these effective ( and somewhat hidden ) priors .",
    "it seems very likely that there have been at least two periods of accelerated expansion during the evolution of the universe . during the first period , called inflation ,",
    "the perturbations that led to today s structure were generated , while the second one has started only recently and is attributed to a mysterious dark energy . in this paper",
    "we ask what a similar physical origin would imply for the dark energy .",
    "one point that is immediately clear is that since inflation ended , there is reason to assume that it was not due to a cosmological constant .",
    "this is supported by the tentative detection of a deviation from an exact harrison - zeldovich spectrum with @xmath6 @xcite : a period dominated by a ( possibly effective ) cosmological constant would either result in no perturbations at all or in perturbations with an exactly scale - invariant spectrum , depending on how precisely the de sitter state is reached .",
    "the former possibility is clearly excluded , and while current observations are not yet conclusive on whether @xmath6 is excluded , the planck satellite should settle the question within the next few years , since it is expected to reach a precision of @xmath55 @xcite . a clear detection of @xmath26 would require either @xmath56 or @xmath57 , with a constant @xmath5 being ruled out in both cases .",
    "however , there is also no requirement for the equation of state parameter @xmath2 to differ appreciably from @xmath7 during inflation as @xmath2 is directly proportional to the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations , and no primordial gravitational waves have been detected so far .",
    "thus , even though it may be possible that planck demonstrates that inflation was _ not _ due to a cosmological constant , this does not imply that @xmath2 was measurably different from @xmath7 .",
    "indeed , we find that current data allows @xmath2 to be arbitrarily close to @xmath7 as long as it changes just slightly during its evolution .",
    "this direct link between @xmath2 and the gravitational wave background reinforces the importance of the latter as a probe of early universe physics : if it is detected then we know immediately that @xmath2 was measurably different from @xmath7 during inflation .",
    "we have also found that the current experimental limits on @xmath2 during inflation imply @xmath58 at a scale of @xmath52/mpc . if we take seriously the idea that early and late - time acceleration are based on similar mechanisms , then this might suggest that dark energy probes need to reach at least this precision in order to have a reasonable chance of detecting any deviation from @xmath20 . following the arguments from the end of section",
    "ii , one could argue for a target precision of about @xmath59 for measuring @xmath2 , beyond which there may well be a `` @xmath2 desert '' extending to very low values of @xmath54 .",
    "this precision also roughly leads to a decisive bayes factor in favour of @xmath20cdm if no deviation from @xmath7 is detected ( when looking at constant @xmath2 , see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite for the methodology ) .",
    "however , the absence of an observational lower limit on @xmath2 during inflation should not be taken as argument against measuring the recent expansion history and evolution of perturbations .",
    "firstly , there is no direct evidence that the two periods of accelerated expansion are due to the same underlying physical mechanism . secondly , even if that is so , it is likely that we are observing a very different epoch of the inflationary phenomenon today than in the early universe .",
    "the acceleration became observationally relevant only very recently , less than one @xmath27-folding ago .",
    "if the onset of acceleration coincides with it becoming visible , then we could expect strong deviations from @xmath5 , since also at the end of inflation @xmath2 deviated strongly from @xmath7 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : w_n ] . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also possible that the dark energy has been present much longer but was buried beneath the matter and has but surfaced recently . in this case",
    "inflation indicates that it is natural for a scalar field dark energy to have an equation of state close to @xmath60 .",
    "finally , inflation and the current epoch are accessible in very different ways : from inflation we observe the curvature perturbations generated out of quantum fluctuations , while for the recent history of the universe we instead observe directly the evolution of the expansion history as well as possibly the impact of the dark energy perturbation or of deviations from general relativity onto light deflection and the distribution of galaxies . if the physics underlying the accelerated expansion of inflation and dark energy are related , then the two sets of observations are complementary and mutually reinforcing , and observational results for either period of accelerated expansion may help to shed light on the other one as well .",
