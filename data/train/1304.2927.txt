    "however , most of experimental methods can detect only the amplitude of the pair potential , whereas a few are phase sensitive .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to look for new methods capable of detecting the phase of the pair potential .    in this paper , we theoretically investigate the quasiparticle scattering rate @xmath0 inside a vortex core and show that it can be used as a phase sensitive probe when changing the direction of applied magnetic field .",
    "the field - angle dependences of the thermal conductivity and the specific heat have been discussed so far @xcite .",

    "we consider a single vortex core in a system in which non - magnetic impurities are distributed randomly . the quasiparticle scattering rate @xmath0 is obtained from the imaginary part of the impurity self energy @xmath3 .",
    "we calculate @xmath4 on the basis of the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity @xcite . for the vortex bound states around a vortex core , analytic solutions of the quasiclassical green s functions",

    "we consider a coordinate system fixed to crystal axes characterized by orthogonal unit vectors @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "first , let us start with the situation where the two coordinate systems coincide ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) , and then rotate the vector @xmath27 ( i.e. , the direction of @xmath24 ) by the polar angle @xmath45 around the @xmath40 axis ( thus , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) .",
    "next , we rotate @xmath27 ( @xmath48 ) by the azimuth angle @xmath49 around the @xmath41 axis ( see fig .  1 ) . in this case , we have the relation @xmath50 in this paper , we consider a single - band superconductor with an isotropic spherical fermi surface , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 , for clarity . using the above relation ( [ eq:8 ] )",
    ", one can express @xmath53 in the coordinate system fixed to the magnetic field , then evaluate @xmath29 , and finally obtain the relations @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "thus , all quantities are represented in the coordinate system fixed to the crystal axes .",
    "we have now reached to a position where we can calculate eq .",

    "the following three types of cooper pairing are considered on the isotropic spherical fermi surface .",

    "the anti - node directions correspond to the @xmath61 ones .    in figs .",
    "[ fig:2][fig:4 ] , we show the scattering rate @xmath0 of the vortex bound states as a function of the field - angle @xmath49 ( see also fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "each curve corresponds to different energies @xmath13 of the quasiparticle . in the case of the line - node @xmath1-wave pair ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) , @xmath0 exhibits its minimum around the gap - node direction @xmath62 . while similar behavior is seen also in the case of the point - node @xmath1-wave pair ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) at the low energy @xmath63 , a difference appears at higher energies .",
    "the minimum appears also around the anti - node direction in the case of the point - node pair , which is in contrast to the case of the line - node s - wave pair .",
    "more prominent difference appears between the line - node @xmath1-wave and the @xmath2-wave pair ( compare figs .",
    "[ fig:2 ] and [ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "@xmath0 always exhibits its maximum at the gap - node direction in the case of the @xmath2-wave pair and the ratio of the maximum value to the minimum one increases with increasing the energy @xmath13 , which quite contrasts to the case of the line - node @xmath1-wave pair .",
    "these two pair potentials , ( i ) and ( iii ) above , have the same form in the amplitude @xmath64 .",
    "the only difference is that the pair potential exhibits a sign change for the @xmath2-wave pair ( iii ) , and not for the @xmath1-wave one ( i ) . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) of @xmath0 , the only part that reflects the sign of the pair potential is the coherence factor @xcite , @xmath65 \\cos\\theta$ ] . owing to this factor , arises the prominent difference in the field - angle dependence of @xmath0 between the @xmath1-wave and the @xmath2-wave pair state .",
    "as seen in the preceding section , the field - angle dependence of the scattering rate @xmath0 of the vortex bound states reflects the cooper pairing symmetry .",
    "this suggests that its measurements can be considered as a new phase - sensitive probe .",
    "@xmath12 of the vortex bound states is related to the flux flow resistivity @xmath66 in moderately clean systems @xcite even when the superconducting gap has nodes on a fermi surface @xcite .",
    "the field - angle dependence of @xmath67 may be measured by rotating an applied magnetic field within a plane normal to a driving current ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "the microwave surface impedance measurement is a promising experimental method to estimate @xmath67 avoiding the vortex pinning effect at low temperatures @xcite if it is possible to rotate an applied magnetic field there .",
    "we have investigated the quasiparticle scattering rate @xmath0 inside a vortex core under the existence of non - magnetic impurities .",
    "the expression of @xmath0 is derived in a form where the applied magnetic field can be rotated in a plane .",
    "we find that the behavior of @xmath0 as a function of the applied - field direction reflects the sign of the cooper pairing .",
    "the difference in @xmath0 between the @xmath1-wave and the @xmath2-wave pair is especially prominent despite the same gap amplitude anisotropy they have .",
    "that difference arises because of the coherence factor which depends on the sign of the pair potential .",
    "therefore , the field - angle dependence of @xmath0 is sensitive to the phase of cooper pair in contrast to the field - angle dependence of the specific heat , which is known to be phase insensitive .",
    "elucidation of more detailed mechanism of the field - angle dependences in @xmath0 is left for future studies .",
    "@xmath0 is related to the flux flow resistivity , the field - angle dependence of which would be experimentally explored by microwave surface impedance measurements if the direction of an applied magnetic field can be changed there .",
