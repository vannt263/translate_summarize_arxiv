    "during recent years , the physics of single electron tunneling through a quantum dot ( qd ) under the conditions of strong coulomb blockade has been at the focus of intense investigation@xcite .",
    "the number of electrons @xmath3 in a dot can be regulated by a suitable gate voltage @xmath4 applied to an electrode coupled capacitively to the dot .",
    "the coulomb blockade suppresses the tunneling through the dot unless the resonance between its energies filled by @xmath0 and @xmath5 electrons occurs at certain values of @xmath4 , when it compensates the charging energy , i.e. @xmath6 . the differential conductance @xmath7 of a qd forms a diamond - like patterns in the plan @xmath8 where the non - conducting  windows  are separated by a network of coulomb resonance lines ( here @xmath9 is the source - drain voltage ) .",
    "accurate low - temperature experiments demonstrated the existence of kondo resonances in the windows corresponding to _ odd _ occupation of the dot @xcite ( o - diamonds ) .",
    "these resonances are seen as zero - bias anomalies ( zba ) , i.e. as bridges of finite conductance connecting two opposite vertices of o - diamond - shape window at @xmath10 besides , it was predicted theoretically @xcite and observed experimentally @xcite that kondo resonances can appear also in the even occupation windows ( e - diamonds ) at strong enough magnetic fields .",
    "this unconventional magnetic field induced kondo effect arises because the spectrum of the dot possesses a low - lying triplet excitation when the electron at the highest occupied level is excited with spin flip .",
    "the zeeman energy compensates the energy spacing between the two adjacent levels , and the lowest spin excitation possesses an effective spin 1/2 , thus inducing a kondo - like zba in the differential conductance .",
    "similar effect is possible in vertical quantum dots for which the singlet and triplet states may be close in energy both at even and odd occupation .",
    "the influence of an external magnetic field on the orbital part of the wave functions of electrons in vertical quantum dots is , in general , more pronounced than the zeeman effect .",
    "hence , singlet - triplet level crossing are induced by this field , causing the emergence of kondo scattering at even filling or its enhancement at odd filling @xcite .",
    "the theory of kondo tunneling through vertical quantum dots in external magnetic field is developed in refs .    in the present paper",
    "we explore yet another device which manifests the kondo effect in qd with even electron number @xmath0 , namely , a qd with two wells which is refereed to as double quantum dot ( dqd ) .",
    "a systematic treatment of the physics of dqd with even n coupled to metallic leads is presented below .",
    "special attention is given to the symmetry properties of dqd and its representation as a quantum spin rotator .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the tunneling hamiltonian for a qd can be mapped on the kondo hamiltonian in the o - diamond window of the qd . in the e - diamond window , the same procedure of eliminating the charged virtual states results in the four - state hamiltonian of doubly occupied dot where the singlet @xmath11 and triplet @xmath12 levels are intermixed by second - order tunneling . as is shown in ref .",
    ", this effective hamiltonian possesses the dynamical symmetry @xmath1 of a spin rotator . as a kondo scatterer ,",
    "spin rotator possesses new properties in comparison with localized spins obeying su(2 ) symmetry .",
    "the magnetic field induced kondo effect mentioned above is a manifestation of a `` hidden symmetry '' which is a footprint of the @xmath1 group .    in ref .",
    "a special case was considered , namely , an asymmetric dqd formed by two dots of different radii in a parallel geometry coupled by tunneling interaction with even occupation @xmath13 ( @xmath14 stands for left and right respectively ) .",
    "moreover , it has been assumed that the strong coulomb blockade exists in one dot whereas tunneling contact with the metallic leads exists in the other dot . here",
    "we will address more general situations and compare several representations in terms of effective spin hamiltonians .",
    "it will be shown that unusual zba can arise in generic dqd structures .",
    "in particular , the kondo effect induced by quantum dots with @xmath1 spin rotational properties exists in asymmetric dqd also when both the @xmath15 and @xmath16 dots are coupled with the leads and the coulomb blockade is strong enough in both of them .",
    "the main precondition for the emergence of the kondo effect in this case is the sizable difference in ionization energies of the two dots .",
    "this quantity can , in fact , be tuned by an application of a suitable gate voltage to one of them .",
    "the same effect can be achieved also in a symmetric dqd with even occupation in a parallel geometry provided the axial symmetry of the system is broken by the difference in gate voltages applied to the right and left dot ( @xmath17 , respectively ) .",
    "dqd oriented parallel to the lead surfaces were fabricated several years ago @xcite .",
    "two main resonance effects were noticed in such electric circuit .",
    "first , one of the dots ( say , right ) can be used as an electrometer @xcite .",
    "scanning @xmath18 at fixed @xmath19 , coulomb oscillations can be induced both in the right and left dot because the interdot capacitive coupling changes the positions of coulomb resonance in both of them . as a result , the step - wise structure of the conductance acquires more complicated form .",
    "the coulomb blockade windows between the resonances in the coulomb energy of the dot @xmath20 form an  egg - carton",
    " pattern @xcite where the vertices connect the windows with charge configurations @xmath21 .",
    "the lines @xmath22 are the regions where the coulomb resonance induced by @xmath18 allows tunneling through the left dot .",
    "second , the resonance @xmath23 allows cotunneling through the right and left dots , which is the precondition for the kondo effect due to appearance of pseudospin - like configuration of the dqd @xcite .",
    "then , manipulating with @xmath18 , one can induce the third transition @xmath24 thus closing the loop and organizing the  electron pump  which transfer single electron from one dot to another ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the picture becomes even richer if the tunneling between the right and left wells of the dqd is taken into account .",
    "then the dot can be treated as an artificial molecule where the interdot tunneling results in formation of complicated manifold of bonding and anti - bonding states @xcite which modifies its charge degrees of freedom .",
    "besides , it induces an indirect exchange , thus modifying the kondo resonances when the dots are placed in series @xcite",
    ". it will be shown below that the interdot tunneling in _ parallel _ geometry results in the appearance of kondo precursor of coulomb resonance along the lines @xmath25 provided there exists direct tunneling coupling @xmath26 between the left and right dot .",
    "we consider the simplest case of @xmath27 in a neutral ground state of dqd .",
    "it will be shown that unconventional kondo resonance occurs under condition @xmath28\\ll 1 $ ] . moreover",
    ", this kind of kondo resonance can appear also in the middle of the coulomb window for the right dot , provided the capacitance of the left dot exceeds essentially that of the right dot@xcite . in both cases , the dqd possesses the symmetry of a spin rotator .    in section 2",
    "the various setups of dqd are introduced and the hamiltonian describing the dqd is written down within the framework of a generalized anderson model .",
    "the phase diagram of charging states in the left and right gate voltages plan is schematically drown , and the regions of kondo resonance are indicated . in the first part of section 3 the spectrum of the isolated dot with even occupation",
    "is discussed .",
    "the second part is devoted to the derivation and solution of renormalization group ( rg ) equations for the dqd .",
    "the central result of this sub section is a demonstration of possible singlet triplet level crossing due to tunneling . when the renormalized energies are below the reduced band edge , renormalization stops , and charge fluctuations are suppressed .",
    "this is the schrieffer - wolff regime , and a derivation of an effective spin hamiltonian is executed in section 4 . in the first part , the spin hamiltonian is given in terms of two vector operators and is shown to have the @xmath1 symmetry of a spin rotator .",
    "it is followed by a short subsection in which the renormalization group flow of coupling constants is explained and the kondo temperature is derived .",
    "then , in the third subsection , a two spin representation is suggested , in which the occurrence of two spin 1/2 operators just reflects the fact that the algebra @xmath29 is a direct sum of two @xmath30 algebras . in the fourth subsection ,",
    "the possibility of arriving at the kondo effect in finite magnetic field is discussed , leading to a third representation of the spin hamiltonian .",
    "the question of whether a dqd with two electrons can be regarded as a real two site kondo system ( even if the dqd is highly asymmetric ) is discussed in section 5 .",
    "in particular , a stringent comparison is made with the two spin representation mentioned in section 4 .",
    "the paper is concluded in section 6 .",
    "some technical details of various calculations are relegated to the appendix .",
    "two models considered in this work are sketched in fig.1 .",
    "we will refer to a system ( a ) with zero gate voltages as a  symmetric  dqd . the same system with finite but unequal gate voltages @xmath31 will be called a  biased  dqd and the pair of dots with different radii shown in fig .",
    "1b will be referred to as  asymmetric  dqd .    in all cases",
    "the dqd is described by a generalized anderson tunneling hamiltonian which takes into account the internal structure of the dqd , @xmath32 the first term , @xmath33 is related to the lead electrons , @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes electrons from the source and drain electrodes @xcite and @xmath36 is the spin index . the second term , @xmath37 is the tunneling hamiltonian , @xmath38 here @xmath39 , and   @xmath40 the third term , @xmath41 describes the isolated dqd . in the present context ,",
    "the quantum dot is a  molecule  , containing @xmath42 electrons in a neutral ground state .",
    "the capacitive interaction _ between the two wells of the _ dqd is assumed to be strong enough to suppress the fluctuations of electron tunneling induced occupation in the windows between the coulomb resonances of tunneling amplitude .",
    "we consider dqd with even @xmath0 , so that , generically , the ground state of an isolated dqd is a spin singlet .",
    "the isolated dot is then described by the hamiltonian , @xmath43 in which @xmath26 is the inter - well constant tunneling amplitude .",
    "the capacitive interaction within the dqd is described by the term @xmath44 here @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the deviation of electron distribution from the neutral charge configuration @xmath47 for a given dqd .",
    "moreover , @xmath48 is the charging energy of the dot @xmath49 whose capacitance is @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the capacitive coupling between the left and right dots .",
    "the simplest configuration which contains in a nutshell all the complicated physics of many - body interactions arising in a course of tunneling is @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "this case , for which @xmath54 , will be given a special attention below . finally , the term @xmath55 represents the gate voltage energy .",
    "we consider symmetric and asymmetric dqds formed by wells of equal and different radii respectively ( fig .",
    "1 ) . hence , generically , the gate potential @xmath55 is asymmetric , @xmath56 it is , in fact , useful to include the gate potential ( [ 1.2b ] ) in the position of the one - electron energy levels , @xmath57 .",
    "then , by tuning the gate voltage one can change the energy difference @xmath58 or , in other words , redistribute the electron density between the left and right wells of the dqd .",
    "it is assumed that in equilibrium and at zero gate voltages , each dot is filled by one electron and the fermi level of the leads is in the middle of the coulomb blockade window .",
    "the energy levels of a symmetric dqd with uncoupled dots @xmath59 ) are shown in the upper panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "these levels may be shifted relative to each other and to the fermi level @xmath60 , and each level crossing @xmath61 corresponds to recharging of the dot @xmath49 .",
    "if electron exchange between the right dot and the leads is blocked @xcite , the charge transfer resonance between the states @xmath62 and @xmath63 occurs when @xmath64 ( see also @xcite ) . in the general case ( fig.1a )",
    ", additional electron appears in the dot @xmath49 when the levels @xmath65 and @xmath60 cross .    in the absence of interdot tunneling , @xmath66",
    ", one can easily obtain the effective spin hamiltonian for the dqd with @xmath52 in the ground state far deep in the coulomb blockade windows .",
    "this is the two - site kondo hamiltonian in the window @xmath62 and the single site kondo hamiltonians in the windows @xmath67 and @xmath68 . in the latter case of charged dqd occupied by odd number of electrons , tunneling through the left ( right ) dot",
    "is blocked , but a kondo - type resonance compensates for the coulomb blockade and opens a tunneling channel through the right ( left ) dot . in the former case of neutral dqd with even occupation the possibility of kondo tunneling is determined by the relative strength of the on - site indirect exchange @xmath69 between the spins @xmath70 of singly occupied dots and conduction electrons in the reservoir on the one hand , and the sign and magnitude of the intersite rkky exchange @xmath71 on the other hand @xcite .",
    "both these parameters are predetermined by the tunnel coupling constants @xmath72 with the band electrons in the reservoir , but one can modify them by varying the gate voltages and interdot distance .",
    "the interdot coupling significantly modifies this picture .",
    "it favors the singlet spin state in the middle of the coulomb blockade window @xmath62 thus eliminating the kondo tunneling at zero gate voltages . at finite @xmath73 or @xmath74",
    ", one can bias the charge distribution in favor of left or right dot , respectively , without changing the total number of electrons . as a result , with increasing @xmath75",
    "one reaches the region of states with small charge transfer gap @xmath76 .",
    "the energy levels of such `` biased '' dqd are shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "these states occupy the upper right corner of the window @xmath62 hatched in fig.3a . here",
    "the zero energy configuration illustrated by fig .",
    "2a corresponds to the coordinate origin .",
    "the virtual charge transfer excitations ( dashed arrow in the upper panel of fig.2b ) significantly influence the tunneling through the dqd .",
    "it will be shown below that a novel type of kondo resonance arises in this area of the sector @xmath62 .",
    "the `` biased '' dqd in this sector behaves like a spin singlet at high temperatures and excitation energies , and demonstrates the properties of spin one triplet partially screened by the kondo tunneling at low energies and temperatures @xmath77 .",
    "the kondo temperature @xmath78 is a function of @xmath79 .",
    "the kondo `` isotherm '' @xmath80 is presented by the dashed line in fig .",
    "similar effect exists for the asymmetric dqd ( fig .",
    "1c ) where the two coupled dots have different radii @xmath81 and hence different blockade energies , @xmath82 .",
    "the energy levels of an isolated dqd are shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "2c , and the corresponding recharging map is presented in fig .",
    "the hatched area also marks the region of the map where kondo effect arises in spite of the even number of electrons in the dot .",
    "the kondo isotherms in this case are parallel to the coulomb resonance line .",
    "conventional approach for the description of the kondo effect in a two - site quantum dot starts with the _ two - center _",
    "hamiltonian @xmath83 and treats @xmath84 in terms of a two channel tunneling operator , @xmath85 the interdot interaction @xmath86 is considered as a coupling between two resonant anderson centers .",
    "if the left and right dot each contains an odd number of electrons ( as in our simplified model with @xmath87 ) , the kondo tunneling is possible through each dot separately .",
    "the exchange part of interdot coupling maps our hamiltonian onto the two - site kondo model .",
    "this coupling can be both of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic type . in the latter case",
    "the interplay between @xmath84 and @xmath86 results in suppression of kondo tunneling through the left and/or right well of the dqd .",

    ", the interdot interaction is represented by the term @xmath88 till we remain in the charge sectors @xmath89 of fig .",
    "it is obvious that this coupling suppresses kondo tunneling through the symmetric dqd at zero gate voltages ( point  0  in fig .",
    "3a ) because the effective indirect exchange interaction which arises due to virtual excitations of charged states @xmath90 is of antiferromagnetic sign , @xmath91 like in the heitler - london limit for a hydrogen molecule or in the half - filled hubbard model . as a result ,",
    "the ground state of a dqd is a spin singlet , and the gap @xmath92 which divides the triplet excitation from the singlet spin ground state prevents the formation of a kondo resonance",
