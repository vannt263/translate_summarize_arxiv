    "apart from the identification of dark matter , the most dominant question in cosmology today is that of what is responsible for the apparent acceleration of the universal expansion . assuming that the cause is a dominant energy component with negative pressure , current efforts are focused on establishing whether this dark energy ( de ) component can be described using a cosmological constant ( cc ) , i.e. an energy component with constant density and a fixed equation of state ( eos ) given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 , or whether dark energy is dynamical ( dde ) with a varying eos , @xmath4 .",
    "two main techniques are employed in these investigations : probing cosmological distances and probing the growth of cosmological structures , both of which are sensitive to the energy content of the universe .",
    "distances are most robustly probed via type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) , the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) peak @xcite and the last scattering surface of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite .",
    "structure growth is mainly probed by large galaxy surveys such as the 2df @xcite and the sdss @xcite but also via galaxy cluster counts @xcite and weak lensing @xcite . despite some claims to the contrary",
    ", there is a consensus that current data are perfectly consistent with having approximately 70% of the energy density in the universe in the form of a cc @xcite .",
    "however , cosmological distances only depend on the dark energy eos in the form of a double integral and it is thus very difficult to investigate the time evolution of the eos parameter , @xmath5 . though not demanding it , current data thus still allow for large deviations of @xmath5 from the cc value of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "even if the limits on @xmath5 will improve in the future , detecting such an evolution remains notoriously difficult , especially if the deviation from the cc value turns out to be small .",
    "it is thus of interest to look for alternative ways to detect or constrain any behaviour of the de that differs from that of a cc .",
    "one such possibility is to study not temporal evolution , but rather spatial variations in de properties .",
    "the cc value @xmath3 is special in the sense that it not only gives a constant energy density in time , but also that it prevents any spatial clustering of de .",
    "any deviations from this value inevitably cause the de to cluster , a clustering which  if detected  would refute the cc as the dominant energy component in the universe .",
    "the clustering properties of dde in different models and scenarios have been investigated in several recent articles ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . for values close to @xmath3 , such clustering is expected to be weak and take place mainly on very large scales , larger than the current hubble radius and thus inaccessible to observations . on smaller scales , it can be shown that the de density will tend to be anticorrelated with the matter density @xcite .",
    "although , again , the amount of clustering is expected to be small ( on the order of @xmath6 $ ] ) , it is nevertheless important to get observational confirmation that this is indeed the case , even if it is not expected from purely theoretical considerations . on a more speculative note , also in models where the apparent acceleration of the universe is explained in terms of the back - reaction of inhomogeneities in the universe , we expect to have spatial variations in , e.g. , cosmological distances @xcite .",
    "furthermore , cosmological observations can be used to put constraints on the degree of centricity in spherically symmetric inhomogeneous models @xcite and on anisotropic de models @xcite .    one way to probe models with inhomogeneous de or",
    "back - reaction is to look for anisotropies in the observed peak magnitudes of sne  ia .",
    "in general , we expect cosmological distances to be correlated on scales similar to the clustering scale of the de or the matter inhomogeneities responsible for the back - reaction effect .",
    "the detection of such correlations is demanding because of the intrinsic variation and observational uncertainties in sn  ia peak magnitudes .    since systematic effects connected to , e.g.",
    ", the observational properties of different telescopes , calibration issues and details of the light - curve fitting procedure can induce correlations in sn  ia magnitudes , it is important to minimize these effects by using as homogeneous a data set as possible in the analysis .",
    "also , physical effects such as peculiar motions @xcite , gravitational lensing @xcite and dust extinction @xcite will introduce correlations in the sn ia data and need to be controlled and , if possible , corrected for .    in kolatt & lahav @xcite ,",
    "an early data set consisting of a total of 79 sne  ia combined from the supernova cosmology project @xcite and the high-@xmath7 supernova search team @xcite was used to look for directional variations in the best fit cosmological parameters .",
    "the result is consistent with the expected statistical variations in a homogeneous universe .",
    "@xcite used a more homogeneous set of 157 sne  ia @xcite to look for directional variations in the statistical scatter around the best fit cosmological model , again with a result consistent with null variations .",
    "a slightly different technique was used in bochner @xcite to look for anisotropic scatter in 172 sne  ia @xcite with similar results .",
    "although current investigations have been mainly inconclusive , schwartz & weinhorst find an offset in the best fit calibration of low @xmath7 sne  ia , between the north and south equatorial hemispheres at the 95% confidence level .",
    "whether this hint of a north / south asymmetry is due to a statistical coincidence , observational systematic differences , or correlated peculiar motions or has a cosmological origin is not clear at the moment .    in this paper",
    "we devise a general methodology for detecting angular correlations in sn  ia magnitude residuals .",
    "we apply this method to current sn  ia data as well as simulated upcoming data sets .    in section  [ method ] ,",
    "we describe the method for analysing sn  ia magnitude residuals for angular correlations and define the detection limit for such correlations .",
    "two data sets from the literature are analysed for angular correlations in section  [ analyse ] . in section  [ future ] , we present different sn ia surveys and investigate the detection limits for each of them . in section  [ toymodel ] , we assume a toy model correlation function and illustrate how future data can put limits on such a correlation .",
    "the paper is concluded in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "in this paper we study angular correlations only , since the effect from possible de inhomogeneities is larger in the transverse direction than in the radial direction .",
    "moreover , a full three - dimensional study would require larger statistics than currently available .",
    "the data sets we investigate contain both nearby and distant sne  ia , for which we have redshifts , @xmath7 , observed peak magnitudes , @xmath8 , with uncertainties , @xmath9 , as well as positions on the sky , right ascension , @xmath10 , and declination , @xmath11 .",
    "the magnitude residual of a sn  ia on the hubble diagram is the difference between its observed magnitude and the magnitude predicted from its redshift in the best fit cosmology , @xmath12 we define a normalized and scaled residual , @xmath13 , by subtracting the mean and dividing by the uncertainty , @xmath14 note that the @xmath9 include both observational errors and the intrinsic dispersion of the sn  ia peak magnitudes .",
    "thus , for uncorrelated gaussian errors , we expect @xmath13 to follow a normal distribution with mean @xmath15 and dispersion @xmath16 .",
    "the angular correlation function of the magnitude residuals for a certain angular separation is defined as the expectation value of the product of the magnitude residuals of all sn pairs separated by that angle , @xmath17 where the angular separation , @xmath18 , between two sne ( denoted 1 and 2 ) is given by @xmath19 note that our definition of the correlation function is equivalent to the correlation coefficient for the original residuals , @xmath20 , @xmath21 if @xmath22 , the magnitude residuals are correlated , if @xmath23 they are uncorrelated and if @xmath24 they are anticorrelated .      under the assumption that the magnitude residuals follow a gaussian distribution with a mean of zero and a variance @xmath25 , their product will follow a probability density distribution given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the modified bessel function of the second kind and @xmath28 denotes all possible products between the magnitude residuals .",
    "the variance of this probability density distribution is @xmath29 .",
    "the correlation for a given angular separation is the expectation value of the product of the magnitude residuals for @xmath30 sn pairs , where @xmath30 is the number of unique pairs that can be defined from a set of @xmath31 sne , @xmath32 the dispersion in this expectation value is given by @xmath33 since @xmath25 , we can define the @xmath34-standard deviation ( @xmath34-@xmath0 ) detection limit of the angular correlation to be @xmath35",
    "in this section , we will apply the methodology described above to two current sn  ia data sets in order to search for possible angular correlations in the magnitude residuals .",
    "we again stress the importance of using as homogeneous a data set as possible in order to minimize the impact of systematic effects connected to , e.g. , the light - curve fitting method used when deriving the peak magnitudes .",
    "the first year supernova legacy survey ( snls ) data set in astier _ et al _ ( we will denote this data set as astier06 ) contains a total of 115 sne  ia , of which 71 are high @xmath7 snls sne ( @xmath36 ) and 44 are nearby ones ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : snmaps ] ( left panel ) shows the distribution of the sne in the sky in galactic coordinates .",
    "whereas the nearby sne  ia ( plus signs ) are scattered across the entire sky , the snls sne ( triangles ) are confined to four pencil - beam patches , each covering a one - square - degree area .",
    "these patches are referred to as d1-d4 and contain 14 , 8 , 31 and 18 sne , respectively .",
    "the salt light - curve model was used to fit all the sn  ia light curves in the data set .",
    "we add an intrinsic dispersion of @xmath38 to the uncertainties in the observed sn  ia magnitudes provided .",
    "the second data set is from davis _",
    "et al _ ( we denote this as davis07 ) and is a compilation of 192 sne  ia consisting of 60 essence sne , 57 snls sne , 30 hst ` gold ' sne and 45 nearby sne .",
    "figure  [ fig : snmaps ] ( right panel ) shows the distribution of the sne in the sky in galactic coordinates .",
    "most of the low @xmath7 sne ( plus signs ) are the same as in astier06 and thus fairly equally distributed across the sky .",
    "the 147 high @xmath7 sne ( diamonds ) are , on the other hand , very unevenly distributed .",
    "we use the peak magnitudes and uncertainties reported by davis07 , which were obtained using the mcls2k2 light - curve fitter on all photometric data .",
    "the uncertainties include both the observational and the intrinsic magnitude scatter .",
    "since the two data sets have many sne in common , e.g. , most of the nearby sne , the corresponding correlation functions will not be independent .",
    "comparison of the results will provide a useful check on the impact of the light - curve fitter used in deriving the sn  ia peak magnitudes on the angular correlation function .",

    "the values of the magnitude residuals and , consequently , the correlation function obviously depend to some degree on what cosmology we subtract .",
    "however , by varying the cosmological parameters of the subtracted model , we have verified that the impact on the correlation function is very small .",
    "the correlation functions for the 115 sne  ia in astier06 and 192 sne  ia in davis07 are presented in figure  [ fig : astierdavis ] .",
    "the error bars are obtained using monte carlo simulations where we generate 2000 new data sets by adding random numbers from a gaussian distribution with a mean of zero and a variance of @xmath42 to the magnitude residuals of the sne  ia .",
    "these data sets are then analysed to investigate the possible spread in the correlation function .",

    "the data is binned in such a way that each bin contains approximately the same number of sn pairs with an angular resolution of approximately @xmath43 .",
    "note that since each sn  ia is included in several bins , the data points will not be independent from each other , as seen clearly in the right panel of figure  [ fig : astierdavis ] , where almost all the data are below the line .",
    "thus , we do not expect about 1/3 of the points to lie more than 1@xmath0 away from the zero line , as would be the case for uncorrelated data points .",
    "the horizontal bars indicate the range of each bin and the points are placed at the average angular separation in each bin .",

    "therefore , we check the high @xmath7 sne  ia in both astier06 and davis07 for correlations separately , i.e. we exclude the low @xmath7 sne  ia in the analysis . the results are presented in figure  [ fig : highz ] .",

    ", the sne will be separated only by certain angles .",
    "we therefore do the binning at precisely these angles .",
    "the results are consistent with the sn magnitude residuals being uncorrelated .",
    "we note that there are differences in sn  ia brightness between the patches , e.g. , there is a difference in the mean scaled magnitude residual between patch d1 and d4 of @xmath46 ( where d4 is the brighter ) , corresponding to a difference of @xmath47 mag in the mean values of the original residuals .",

    "we now consider the expected detection limit for sn  ia magnitude residual angular correlations for four different survey geometries , corresponding to the complete sdss - ii , snls and snap surveys as well as an all - sky survey .",

    "they aim of the survey is to find roughly 500 sne  ia with @xmath54 in this area out of which 300 sne  ia are expected to be used to build the hubble diagram .      the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) is a pencil - beam survey , using four small square patches , each covering a one - square - degree area ( see figure  [ fig : snmaps ] in section  [ datasets ] for the patch configuration ) .",
    "this is an example of a survey geometry that limits the detection of possible correlations to certain angular scales .",
    "one can either look for correlations inside the patches or between patches ( six different combinations ) . around 500 sne  ia with redshifts up to @xmath55",
    "are expected to be used to build the final hubble diagram .",

    "the proposed lsst ( large synoptic survey telescope ) will search for faint astronomical objects across the entire sky and detect large amounts of sne ia . depending on the observational effort put into following up these detections in the future , it is not unreasonable to assume that this could result in up to 2000 sne ia being put on the hubble diagram at low and intermediate @xmath7 within the next decade .",
    "we generate random sn positions in the ranges defined by the survey geometries and compute the 1-@xmath0 detection limits @xmath57 for each of the four surveys described above . in the results presented in figure  [ fig : corrlimits ] , we have assumed that the magnitude residuals in each bin correlate in the same way , i.e. , the error bars do not reflect the fact that the correlation function may vary over the size of the bin .",
    "the amplitudes and detailed shapes of the individual curves depend on the desired resolution .",

    "we let the magnitude residuals be the sum of an uncorrelated part , @xmath81 , and a correlated part , @xmath82 , due to , e.g. , inhomogeneous de , @xmath83 our toy correlation function has the form of a gaussian , @xmath84 ^ 2\\}\\ , \\ ] ] where the amplitude , @xmath85 , is the variance of the correlated magnitude residuals , @xmath86 , @xmath87 is the angle where the correlation has its maximum value , and @xmath88 is the angular scale of the variation in the correlation function .",
    "we generate random sn positions and uncorrelated intrinsic magnitude residuals with a mean of zero and a variance of @xmath89 .",

    "the error bars represent the 68% confidence limit obtained from equation  ( [ clim ] ) for 300 sdss - ii sne ( triangles ) and 500 snls sne ( diamonds ) .",
    "we have neglected the fact that the correlation function varies over the range of each bin .",

    "the cosmological community is hard at work trying to constrain the behaviour of de .",
    "the most pressing question is whether de is a cc or something dynamical .",
    "a detection of temporal or spatial variations of de would answer this question and refute the assertion of the cc being the dominant energy component in the universe . at the same time",
    ", there are alternative attempts to explain the apparent acceleration of the universe without invoking de at all : instead as originating in the large scale inhomogeneities in the matter distribution . irrespective of their origin",
    ", large scale inhomogeneities would manifest themselves as anisotropies in the observed magnitudes of sne  ia .    in this paper",
    ", we have devised a methodology for detecting angular correlations in sn  ia magnitude residuals .",
    "the methodology was applied to two recently found data sets ( astier06 and davis07 ) , neither of which show any signs of correlations at angular scales @xmath100 .",
    "the uncertainties on the measured correlations , @xmath101 , are approximately 10% and 5% for the astier06 and davis07 data sets respectively , using an angular resolution of @xmath102 .",
    "note , however , that the two data sets are not independent , since they overlap partially for the high redshift sample , and include almost the same set of nearby sne .",
    "the main difference between the data sets is that different assumptions on sn  ia properties , such as intrinsic colour and dust extinction in the host galaxy , are used when deriving the sn  ia peak magnitudes .",
    "such assumptions are responsible for some of the most important systematic uncertainties in sn  ia cosmology .",
    "a comparison between the results for the two data sets allows us to keep the impact of these uncertainties on the measured correlation function under control .",
    "because systematic uncertainties are typically different at low and high redshifts , and we expect effects from de inhomogeneities to grow with redshift , we have applied the same analysis to the two sub - samples separately . at low @xmath7",
    ", we found an anticorrelation at the 2@xmath0 level at angular scales @xmath1 . due to the weak statistical significance of this detection , and the low redshifts",
    ", we can not draw any conclusions about the possible implications for de inhomogeneity .",
    "it is worth noticing that the nearby sne analysed are a collection of very inhomogeneous data samples , collected by different observers at various telescopes and thus , there could be systematic uncertainties involved which have not been included in the error bars ( see , e.g. , discussion in ) .",
    "we note that we see no signs of anisotropy on angular scales @xmath103 , corresponding to the north / south asymmetry detected in .",
    "our data sample , however , is only partially overlapping with that work , since we have only included sne in the hubble flow ( @xmath104 ) in our analysis in order to mitigate the effects from correlations arising from peculiar motions .",
    "gravitational lensing correlations will only be significant on small scales , where we expect the effects from de clustering to be negligible .",
    "using data from the proposed snap satellite , we should be able to detect the lensing correlations in sn  ia magnitudes with an angular resolution of @xmath80 .",
    "correlations induced by intervening galactic dust will also mainly take place on very small angular scales , whereas correlations from dust in the milky way could potentially be a problem for an all - sky survey .",
    "most surveys , however , observe in directions in the sky where the milky way dust extinction is well measured and understood .",
    "more sn data are needed if we are to detect presumably weak correlations and better constrain inhomogeneous / anisotropic models .",
    "our simulations of future data illustrate how the survey geometries govern on what scales , and to what precision , we will be able to detect possible angular correlations .",
    "we find that using data from the soon to be completed sdss - ii and snls surveys , we will typically be able to detect correlations in the magnitude residuals at the per cent level .",
    "any claim of a deviation of de properties from those of a cc will be subject to intense scrutiny from the cosmological community , and will need to be backed up by independent evidence in order to be generally accepted .",
    "it is therefore of utmost importance to pursue the study of de along multiple paths .",
    "although observationally demanding , the search for spatial variations in de properties is a useful complement to studies aiming at constraining the time evolution of de .",
    "specifically , for sne  ia , we expect systematic effects connected to the time evolution of de , such as temporal evolution of sn  ia properties , to be of less importance when studying spatial variations of de .",
    "since systematic effects constitute the limiting factor for future sn  ia surveys , we expect interesting results for the spatial correlations of sn magnitudes in the near future , irrespective of whether such correlations are found or not .",
