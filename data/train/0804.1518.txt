    "cygnus region , located between @xmath1 is a region of recent star formation activity in the milky way and is rich in massive early type stars concentrated in ob associations .",
    "the presence of nebulosity and massive stars indicate that the stars have been forming till very recently and the young clusters found here are the result of the recent star formation event .",
    "though the above fact is known , what is not known is that when this star formation process started and how it proceeded in the region .",
    "thus the aim of the paper is to understand the star formation timescale in this complex , using the recently formed young open clusters .",
    "though one assumes that all the stars in a cluster have the same age , this assumption is not valid when the candidate cluster is very young . in the case of young clusters ( @xmath2 10 myr ) , there is a chance for a spread in the age of the stars , depending on the duration of star formation .",
    "an estimation of this formation time - scale in the clusters formed in a star forming complex , will indicate the duration of star formation and its direction of propagation within the complex . in principle , duration of star formation is defined as the difference between the ages of the oldest and the youngest star formed in the cluster . in practice , the age of the oldest star is assumed as the age of that star which is about to turn - off from the main - sequence ( ms ) ( turn - off age ) and the age of the youngest star is the age of the youngest pre - ms star ( turn - on age ) .",
    "the turn - off age of many clusters are known , but the turn - on age is not known for most of the clusters . the estimation of turn - on age requires the identification of pre - ms stars in the cluster .",
    "hence the duration of star formation in young star clusters is not clearly understood .",
    "this quantity can not be estimated for older clusters where all the stars have reached the ms .",
    "the star clusters studied here are berkeley 86 , ngc 6910 , ic 4996 , berkeley 87 and biurakan 2 .",
    "we aim to combine the ages and the star formation duration in these clusters to understand how the star formation proceeded in the cygnus region .",
    "a number of stars are known to show h@xmath0 emission in this region .",
    "the photometric analysis of the clusters suggested the possible presence of a few emission line stars .",
    "as a followup , we searched , identified and studied these stars . since the estimation of cluster parameters will help in identifying the ages and spectral types of these stars , their emission properties can be linked to their evolutionary status .",
    "early type emission stars are broadly classified as classical be ( cbe ) stars and herbig ae / be ( haebe ) stars , which belong to intermediate mass pre - ms category .",
    "cbe stars are fast rotators whose circumstellar disk is formed through decretion mechanism ( wind / outflow ) ( porter & rivinius 2003 ) .",
    "haebe stars are found to possess a natal accretion disk which is a remnant of star formation ( hillenbrand et al .",
    "the emission is found to come from this equatorial disk as recombination radiation , mainly in balmer lines like h@xmath0 and h@xmath3 .",
    "we have used slitless spectroscopy to search for these emission stars .",
    "emission stars are found to show an ir excess , which is a combination of free - electron excess and dust excess .",
    "we combine the parent cluster parameters and the spectral properties of emission stars , and try to classify them .",
    "fabregat & torrejon ( 2000 ) suggested that emission stars found in clusters younger than 10 myr belong to the hbe type and cbe stars are found only in clusters older than 10 myr . on the other hand ,",
    "the haebe phenomenon is known to last only for a few myr ( hillenbrand et al .",
    "thus it will be interesting to identify and classify emission stars in clusters younger than 10 myr .",

    "spectroscopic identification of pre - ms stars could be done at the brighter end , but is inefficient for fainter stars . in the case of pre - ms stars , the dust grains in the circumstellar disk",
    "absorb a fraction of visible or ultraviolet photons emitted by the central star , heating it to a higher temperature . the disk re - radiates the absorbed energy in infra - red wavelengths .",
    "thus the presence of nir excess is used to distinguish between the pre - ms stars and field stars in the optical cmd .",

    "it is quite likely that the star formation in this region started around 5 myr and had a relatively low level star formation till 1 myr .",
    "the cluster region has experienced vigorous star formation in the last 1 myr .",
    "the duration of star formation is about 5 myr , which is similar to the cluster , biurakan 2 .",
    "star 9 lies on the 0.25 myr pre - ms isochrone and 26 is located on the 0.5 myr isochrone . thus these stars are could be younger than 1 myr , which makes them as candidate haebe stars .",
    "otherwise , these stars could be 5 myr old or slightly older , which would make them as candidate cbe stars .",
    "the pre - ms stars are found to be distributed throughout the cluster field , as shown in figure 15 .",

    "in the cygnus ob region , 5 clusters are studied .",
    "the estimation of the turn - off age and turn - on age of the clusters along with their distance provides a reasonable interpretation about the direction of propagation of star formation in the cygnus ob star forming complex .",
    "the longitude and distance to the cluster is used to derive their location in the cartesian coordinate system as shown in figure 20 .",
    "the estimated duration of star formation in the clusters studied are tabulated in table 5 .",
    "the location of clusters along with their age is used to understand the star formation .",
    "this region , located between the galactic longitudes @xmath29 , has eight more open clusters , for which reliable distance and age estimates are available .",
    "we include these clusters also , as shown in figure 21 , to understand the star formation .",
    "the clusters included are collinder 419 , collinder 421 , ruprecht 172 , ngc 6913 , ngc 6871 , biurakan 1 and ascc 111 .",
    "the first four clusters are located closer to us , closer than 1200 pc and the rest of the three clusters are located very close to be 86 , be 87 and biurakan 2 .",
    "the ages as given in webda for these three clusters are 9 myr , 18 myr and 11 myr , respectively .",
    "we interpret this figure keeping in mind that there may be significant error associated with the estimated distance .",
    "the clusters can be grouped into three groups , the first one is located around 1 kpc , the second group is located at @xmath13 1500 pc and the third group , beyond 2000 pc .",
    "the farthest group consists of two clusters , ngc 6910 and ic 4996 . both the clusters seem to have similar star formation history .",
    "the second group seems to indicate a vigorous star formation , where the relatively older clusters , biurakan 2 , ngc 6871 , biurakan 1 and ascc 111 could have formed first , then berkeley 86 and very recently , berkeley 87 . in both the groups ,",
    "the duration of star formation is about 5  7 myr .",
    "we estimate a short duration for the star formation , 2 myr , in the case of berkeley 87 .",
    "the three clusters studied here indicate an enhanced star formation in the last 1  2 myr . also , the major star forming region with 6 clusters is located at @xmath13 1500 pc , and this could be considered as the most active star forming region within the longitude range @xmath30 and located at @xmath13 1500 pc .",
    "no preferential location for the young pre - ms stars were found in the clusters .",
    "the emission line stars were found in 4 clusters and one was found to be devoid of such stars .",
    "therefore , all clusters in a star forming complex may not harbour emission line stars .",
    "thus , the recent star formation observed in the cygnus was started about 2  7 myr ago , depending on the location .",
    "this implies that the star formation in large complexes can last up to 7 myr .",
    "the main conclusions of the present study can be summarised as follows :    in the cygnus region , 93 candidate pre - ms stars and 9 stars with h@xmath0 emission spectra are identified in 5 clusters .",
    "the duration of star formation ( estimated as the difference between the turn - off and turn - on age ) is estimated for five clusters .",
    "this indicates that the star formation in the clusters were going on for 2  7 myr .",
    "the recent star formation in the cygnus region started @xmath13 7 myr ago .",
    "cbe phenomenon can be found in very young ms stars which are just a few ( 2  7 ) myrs old .",
    "this indicates that the cbe phenomenon need not be an evolutionary effect .",
