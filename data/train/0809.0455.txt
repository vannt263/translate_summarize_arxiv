    "such mixing conditions are not easy to fulfill due to the low reynolds number of the flow involved , which prevents turbulence from taking place .",
    "stirring , in addition to molecular diffusion , is needed to stretch and fold fluid elements , thus significantly increasing interfacial areas . whereas some strategies are based on complex channel geometry for flows in microchannels , active methods ( via external forcing ) ( see , e.g. @xcite )",

    "flows @xcite . in this paper as in @xcite , we concentrate on controlling both the size and the location of the mixing .",
    "indeed , we are interested in both complete and incomplete mixing within drops . while complete mixing should be useful for efficient reactions to occur uniformly , there are applications in which non - uniform mixing , when well - controlled , could be desired .",
    "the latter include the formation of inhomogeneous drops and particles , such as janus particles , whose properties have been shown , in certain cases , to be superior to their homogeneous counterparts . in this paper",

    "let us assume a newtonian liquid droplet of sperical shape suspended in an incompressible newtonian fluid .",
    "its motion consists of a translation and a slow rigid body rotation ( see @xcite ) . as in the previous reference",
    ", we assume that the interfacial tension is sufficiently large for the drop to remain spherical through its motion and that the reynolds number is very small compared to @xmath0 .",
    "thus , a reasonable approximation is to consider that both the internal and external flows are stokes flows .",
    "the boundary conditions at the droplet surface can be derived from the continuity of velocity and tangential stress conditions .",
    "+ the resulting internal flow is a superimposition of a steady base flow ( non - mixing flow ) and an unsteady rigid - body rotation . consider a cartesian coordinate system translating with the center - of - mass velocity of the droplet with the orientation of the axes such that the unit vector @xmath1 points in the direction of the translation and the unit vector @xmath2 lies in the @xmath3 plane .",

    "the rotation is characterized by a rotation with a maximum amplitude @xmath11 , a fixed orientation vector @xmath12 and a periodic amplitude of the rotation @xmath13 . in the present paper",
    "we study two time dependent functions for the amplitude of the rotation @xmath13 , one consisting of only one harmonic : @xmath14 and the other one consisting of a triangular function with an infinite number of harmonics : @xmath15 equations ( [ velot21]-[velot23 ] ) are the same as in @xcite except that the vorticity vector , that was constant in @xcite , is unsteady in our case .",
    "note that the internal flow is a solution of the ( time dependent ) stokes problem in which a time - dependent body force has been added on the right hand side of the momentum equation . in practice , this time - dependent forcing could be realized , e.g. by creating a time - dependent swirl motion in the external flow or by applying an electric field that exerts a torque on the drop ( see , e.g. @xcite or work on electrorotation @xcite ) .",
    "note that the surface of the droplet , @xmath16 is invariant under flow ( [ velot21]-[velot23 ] ) .",

    "in this paper , we have shown that a chaotic mixing region within a droplet is generated by adding a slow oscillatory rigid - body rotation to the translating drop motion .",
    "our strategy consists in using resonances between one of the frequencies of the base flow generated by the steady translation and the forcing frequency characteristic of the oscillatory rigid body rotation .",
    "this strategy allows for a direct control of both the location and the size of the mixing by judiciously adjusting the parameters of the time - dependent rotation , i.e. its amplitude and frequency .",
    "one the one hand , controlling the mixing location could be useful to manufacture inhomogeneous droplets and particles ( such as janus particles ) whose properties could be superior to homogeneous ones . on the other hand , controlling the size of the mixing zone could be important to control reaction rates .",
    "note that in this system , the total mixing state does not have islands of non - mixing zones , as is often the case with other mixing strategies .",
