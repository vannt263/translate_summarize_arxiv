    "however , while in normal fluids and gases these phenomena are fully understood , this is much less the case for their granular counterparts . in order to get a better understanding of the underlying physics , here",
    "we present an experimental overview of the various effects observed in a vibrated bed of glass beads , identifying the dimensionless control parameters that govern them .",
    "the main goal of the paper is to construct an experimental phase diagram in which all the observed phenomena are combined .    our experimental setup ( fig .",
    "[ intro_container ] ) consists of a quasi 2-d perspex container of dimensions @xmath0 mm ( with @xmath1 the container length , @xmath2 the depth , and @xmath3 the height ) , partially filled with glass beads of diameter @xmath4 mm , density @xmath5kg / m@xmath6 , and coefficient of normal restitution @xmath7 .",
    "the setup is mounted on a sinusoidally vibrating shaker with tunable frequency @xmath8 and amplitude @xmath9 .",
    "most of the experiments presented in this paper are performed by upsweep - experiments in which the frequency is linearly increased at @xmath10hz / min .",

    "mm are vibrofluidized .",
    "the length of the container is @xmath14 mm ; the bed height at rest ( @xmath15 ) is varied in our experiments such that the aspect ratio @xmath16 always remains large .",
    "the container depth is only five particle diameters , making the setup quasi two - dimensional.,width=226 ]    the natural dimensionless control parameters to analyze the experiments are ( i ) the shaking parameter , or froude number , @xmath17 ( with @xmath18 and @xmath19m / s@xmath20 ) , being the ratio of the kinetic energy inserted into the system by the vibrating bottom and the potential energy associated with a typical displacement of the particles @xmath21 , ( ii ) the number of bead layers @xmath22 , ( iii ) the inelasticity parameter @xmath23 , and ( iv ) the aspect ratio @xmath16 , where @xmath15 denotes the bed height at rest .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 is taken to be constant in this paper , since we ignore the velocity dependence and use the same beads throughout .",
    "the aspect ratio varies by changing the bed height @xmath15 ( i.e. , the number of layers @xmath22 ) but remains large in all experiments , @xmath25 .",
    "we will systematically vary the first two dimensionless parameters , by changing the amplitude @xmath9 , the frequency @xmath8 , and the number of layers @xmath22 .",
    "the most intriguing of the four parameters above is the first one , the shaking parameter , since the typical displacement of the particles @xmath21 is influenced in a non - trivial way by the vibration intensity and the number of particle layers . for _ mild",
    "_ fluidization the displacement of the particles is determined by the amplitude of shaking @xmath9 , since the bed closely follows the motion of the bottom .",
    "the energy ratio in this case becomes identical to the well known dimensionless shaking acceleration : @xmath26 for _ strong _ fluidization the particles no longer follow the bottom , so ( instead of @xmath9 ) some intrinsic length scale needs to be taken for @xmath21 , such as the particle diameter @xmath27 .",
    "this leads to the dimensionless shaking strength @xmath28",
    "@xcite : @xmath29 at intermediate fluidization , we will encounter phenomena in which there is a competition of length scales . in this region",
    "the transitions are affected by changing one of the competing length scales , meaning that the choice of the appropriate shaking parameter is not a priori clear .",
    "this will become an issue in particular for the transition from undulations to the granular leidenfrost effect described in section  [ sec_leidenfrost ] .    in the following sections , the various phenomena observed in our system",
    "are discussed one by one , in the order in which they appear as the fluidization is increased : bouncing bed ( section  [ sec_bouncing ] ) , undulations ( [ sec_undulations ] ) , granular leidenfrost effect ( [ sec_leidenfrost ] ) , convection rolls ( [ sec_convection ] ) , and granular gas ( [ sec_gas ] ) .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec_phasediagram ] all five phenomena will be combined in a phase diagram of the relevant shaking parameter versus the number of layers .",
    "for shaking accelerations @xmath30 ( and even for @xmath31 slightly above @xmath32 ) the granular bed behaves as a solid , co - moving with the vibrating bottom and never detaching from it . in order to detach ,",
    "the bottom must at some point during the cycle have a downward acceleration that overcomes gravity ( as for a single bouncing ball  @xcite ) _ plus _ the friction between the bed and the walls of the container .",
    "these walls carry a considerable portion of the bed weight , as described by the rayleigh - jansen model  @xcite .",
    "once the detachment condition is fulfilled , the bed bounces in a similar way as a single particle would do : we call this a bouncing bed , see fig .",

    "sano  @xcite was able to derive a theoretical form of the undulation modes , which qualitatively agrees with the form of the experimental ones in fig .",
    "[ und_modes_examples ] .",

    "the reason for this is that the necessary horizontal dilation ( of the lower layer ) upon impact with the bottom is more readily accomplished due to pressure from the extra layers on top .",
    "it is seen in fig .",
    "[ und_onset ] that the data for the three different shaking amplitudes coincide reasonably , except at the threshold value of @xmath67 layers .",
    "presumably , at this small value of @xmath22 the dilation can only become sufficient if the density is locally enhanced by a statistical fluctuation ; when the experiment would be repeated many times the agreement between the averaged data for various @xmath9 is expected to become better . for @xmath68 layers no undulations",

    "however , the sequence of modes is seen to be interrupted somewhere in the middle : here the undulation pattern gives way to the granular leidenfrost state  @xcite , in which a cluster of slow particles is floating on top of a dilute layer of fast particles .",
    "normally , this state appears at the end of the undulation regime ( see section  [ sec_leidenfrost ] ) , but when a certain standing wave pattern is energetically unfavorable the system chooses the leidenfrost state instead . in fig .",
    "[ und_onset_allmodes ] we see that this happens to the @xmath69 undulation , which is completely skipped from the sequence for @xmath70 layers .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that the @xmath69 mode has an antinode at the sidewall ( i.e. , a highly mobile region ) , whereas the friction with the wall tends to slow down the particles here .",
    "this inherent frustration gives rise to the appearance of the granular leidenfrost effect .",
    "likewise , the small leidenfrost region for @xmath71 below the onset line of the @xmath72 undulation may well be the result of a frustrated @xmath72 mode here .",

    "the bottom layer of the undulations is completely evaporated and forms the gaseous region on which the cluster floats .",
    "the phenomenon is analogous to the original leidenfrost effect in which a water droplet hovers over a hot plate on its own vapor layer , when the temperature of the plate exceeds a critical value  @xcite .",
    "the vaporized lower part of the drop provides a cushion to hover on , and strongly diminishes the heat contact between the plate and the drop , enabling it to survive for a relatively long time .    in fig .",

    "the leidenfrost state was reached directly from the solid , bouncing bed regime , without the intermediate stage of undulations .",
    "presumably this was due to the much smaller aspect ratio @xmath16 , which was in the order of @xmath32 ( against @xmath82 in the present leidenfrost experiments )  @xcite .",
