    "the circumnuclear matter surrounding the putative supermassive accreting black hole in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , thought to be responsible for obscuration of the primary continuum emission in type  2 agns , also plays a critical role in accounting for the shape of the cosmic x - ray background spectrum , or cxrb ( e.g. gilli , comastri & hasinger 2007 ; ueda et al .",
    "2014 ) . in recent years",
    ", much emphasis has been placed upon compton - thick agns , formally defined by an optical depth to electron scattering in the thomson limit that is greater than unity ( @xmath5 , or @xmath6 ) .",
    "although this value of @xmath7 is arbitrary in terms of the effects of photoelectric absorption , compton scattering , and the prominence of the ubiquitous fe  k@xmath0 emission line , the distinction separates sources in which the mean number of scatterings per photon is less than or greater than one ( for compton - thin and compton - thick sources respectively ) . strictly speaking",
    ", the compton - thick definition should also be energy - dependent , but the conventional use of the term in the literature ignores this , so the conventional use implicitly refers to the low - energy limit , when the klein - nishina cross - section is equal to the thomson cross - section . with these caveats , it is generally thought that compton - thick agns could constitute @xmath8 or more of the obscured agn population that contributes to the cxrb ( e.g. gilli et al .",
    "2007 ; ueda et al .",
    "2014 , and references therein ) .    in type  1 agns",
    "the same circumnuclear matter distribution can imprint signatures of compton scattering ( reflection ) and fluorescent line emission on the observed x - ray continuum .",
    "such a scenario is in line with agn unification schemes , in which the line - of - sight to type  1 agn is unobscured due to the geometry of the circumnuclear matter ( e.g. antonucci & miller 1985 ; antonucci 1993 ; urry & padovani 2005 ) . regardless of agn classification , the gas and dust can reprocess the impinging intrinsic x - ray continuum into infrared emission ( e.g. elitzur 2008 ; yaqoob & murphy 2011a ; georgantopoulos et al .",
    "hereafter , we refer to the circumnuclear matter as the x - ray reprocessor .",
    "using x - ray spectroscopy to infer the properties of the x - ray reprocessor in agns is thus important , yet it has not been fully exploited .",
    "this is because models used to fit the data have traditionally been over - simplistic , employing ad hoc components that do not self - consistently account for the fe  k@xmath0 line emission and compton - scattered continuum . instead of producing the fe  k@xmath0 line and reflection continuum in finite column density material ( such as that detected in the line - of - sight ) , material out of the line - of - sight was modeled using a slab with an infinite column density , with an inclination angle relative to the observer fixed at an arbitrary value .",
    "such models can not therefore be used to _ measure _ the average global column density out of the line - of - sight , because the starting premise is that it is compton - thick , without compelling justification .",
    "a good fit to the data with these models does not imply uniqueness .",
    "ideally , one would like to make no assumptions about the global column density of the reprocessor , and use the data to constrain the allowed values , including the `` pure reflection '' spectrum case ( i.e. reflection from infinitely - thick matter ) as a limiting form of a more general model .",
    "such physically - motivated models that self - consistently treat the compton - reflection and fe  k@xmath0 fluorescent emission - line for finite column density matter , and that can be directly fitted to x - ray data , have recently been introduced and applied ( e.g. ikeda , awaki , & terashima 2009 ; murphy & yaqoob 2009 ; brightman & nandra 2011 ; tatum et al .",
    "2013 ; liu & li 2014 ) . as well as",
    "fitting data from new x - ray observations ( e.g. lamassa et al .",
    "2014 ; brightman et al .",
    "2015 ) , it is fruitful to re - examine archival data to investigate to what extent previous conclusions change .",
    "compton reflection from finite column density matter produces a rich variety of possible spectra ( that depend on geometry and viewing angle , as well as column density ) , and can be very different to the x - ray reflection spectrum from an infinite column density slab ( e.g. see ikeda et al .",
    "2009 ; murphy & yaqoob 2009 ; brightman & nandra 2011 ; liu & li 2014 ) . in particular , the so - called `` compton hump , '' is no longer confined to the energy range of @xmath9  kev because the peak energy of the reflection spectrum depends on column density and geometry .",
    "in addition , the fe abundance , which is often inferred from comparison of the fe k edge in the reflection spectrum and the data , is subject to change , once the column density of the reflector is allowed to be finite and free .",
    "intrinsic inferred luminosities are also subject to revision .",
    "overall , the improved methodology allows one to probe the three - dimensional structure of the x - ray reprocessor in a unified way , as opposed to a disjoint view afforded by one - dimensional partial covering models , combined with reflection from an infinite column density slab with an arbitrary orientation relative to the observer .",
    "indeed , the term `` compton - thick '' now becomes even more ambiguous , as one should specify , for a particular agn , whether the term refers to the line - of - sight column density , or to the average column density of the global matter distribution out of the line - of - sight , or both .",
    "the seyfert  2 galaxy mkn  3 , which is nearby at @xmath10 ( tifft & cocke 1988 ) , has been well - studied across the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "it is prototypical of its class , in that the optical broad emission lines are only seen in polarized light ( miller & goodrich 1990 ; tran 1995 ) .",
    "mkn  3 has been a target of all major x - ray astronomy missions since _ exosat _ , and it is currently regarded in the literature as an archetypal compton - thick agn .    high spectral - resolution grating studies with _ chandra _ ( sako et al . 2000 ) , and _ xmm - newton _ ( pounds et al . 2005 ; bianchi et al .",
    "2005 ) have established an extremely complex soft x - ray spectrum ( below @xmath11  kev ) , rich with emission lines due predominantly to photoionized gas covering a broad range of ionization states .",

    "2011 ) were all interpreted using a similar model , consisting of line - of - sight absorption and scattering , along with an x - ray reflection continuum formed in an infinite column density slab of neutral material .",
    "the prominent fe  k@xmath0 line was modeled with an ad hoc gaussian component . _ chandra _ high spectral resolution grating data ( shu , yaqoob , & wang 2011 ) provided the best evidence that the fe  k@xmath0 line originates in neutral matter .",
    "shu et al . ( 2011 ) also measured a width of @xmath12  fwhm for the fe  k@xmath0 line , establishing the size of the line emitter to be @xmath13 times larger than the optical blr ( but smaller than the warm , photoionized region contributing to the soft x - ray spectrum ) .",
    "the line - of - sight column density was @xmath14 in all of the observations .",
    "thus , whilst the nearly compton - thick column density of the line - of - sight absorption was fairly robust because it does not depend on the geometry of the reprocessor , the compton - thick nature of the _ global _ matter distribution was an assumption , not an inference .",
    "the ad hoc treatment of the fe  k@xmath0 line in previous studies also lead to some anomalous results that were deemed `` puzzling . '' for example , guainazzi et al .",
    "( 2012 ) found in a variability study that the fe  k@xmath0 line flux was uncorrelated with the x - ray reflection continuum , yet the two emission components are physically related , implying that the model is incomplete .",
    "another example is the compton shoulder to the fe  k@xmath0 line ( due to scattered line photons ) , whose strength relative to the line core depends on the column density and geometry of the line emitter ( e.g. see matt 2002 ; yaqoob & murphy 2010 ) . using a nonphysical ( gaussian ) model of the compton shoulder , pounds et al .",
    "( 2005 ) forced insertion of a compton shoulder that would be expected from the infinite column density slab that produces the reflection continuum in their model , at the expense of distorting the centroid of the line core .",
    "they found that the peak of the fe  k@xmath0 line core increased by @xmath15  ev to @xmath16  kev , and they estimated the ratio of the flux in the compton shoulder to that in the core to be @xmath17 .",
    "however , they also stated that adding the compton shoulder did not result in a statistically significant improvement to the fit .",
    "this lack of a compelling compton shoulder is only puzzling if the reflection continuum is modeled as originating in compton - thick matter .",
    "however , such a choice for the reflection continuum is an assumption , not an inference . indeed",
    ", none of the above anomalies can ever arise if self - consistent , finite column density models of the x - ray reprocessor are employed , because the reflection continuum and the fe  k@xmath0 line , including its compton shoulder , are all self - consistently determined from the outset .",
    "moreover , the compton - thick limit can be included in such models .",
    "ikeda et al . (",
    "2009 ) did attempt to fit the _ suzaku _ mkn  3 spectrum with a self - consistent toroidal model .",
    "however , their model was based on monte carlo calculations with insufficient statistical quality to properly perform @xmath18 minimization and statistical error analysis , so they were not able to derive robust constraints on the global matter distribution .",
    "they obtained a line - of - sight column consistent with previous studies , and were able to fit the data with a compton - thick global matter distribution , but they could not rule out smaller column densities for the matter out of the line - of - sight .",
    "thus , it is in the context described above that we re - examine the _ suzaku _ x - ray spectrum of mkn  3 , using the x - ray reprocessor models of murphy & yaqoob ( 2009 ) , and brightman & nandra ( 2011 ) , which overcome the limitations of previous spectral - fitting analyses . amongst the historical x - ray data sets , the _ suzaku _",
    "data are best suited for studying the x - ray reprocessor because the instrumentation simultaneously covers the critical fe  k band ( @xmath19  kev ) with good spectral resolution and throughput ( due to the xis ccd detectors ) , and the hard x - ray band above 10  kev with good sensitivity .",

    "the present study pertains to an observation of mkn  3 made by the joint japan / us x - ray astronomy satellite , _ suzaku _ ( mitsuda et al .",
    "2007 ) in 2005 , october 22 .",
    "_ suzaku _ carries four x - ray imaging spectrometers ( xis  koyama et al .  2007 ) and a collimated hard x - ray detector ( hxd  takahashi et al .",
    "each xis consists of four ccd detectors at the focal plane of its own thin - foil x - ray telescope ( xrt  serlemitsos et al .",
    "2007 ) , and has a field - of - view ( fov ) of @xmath21 .",
    "one of the xis detectors ( xis1 ) is back - side illuminated ( bi ) and the other three ( xis0 , xis2 , and xis3 ) are front - side illuminated ( fi ) .",
    "the bandpass of the fi detectors is @xmath22  kev and @xmath23  kev for the bi detector .",
    "the useful bandpass depends on the signal - to - noise ratio of the source since the effective area is significantly diminished at the extreme ends of the operational bandpasses .",
    "although the bi ccd has higher effective area at low energies , the background level across the entire bandpass is higher compared to the fi ccds .",
    "the hxd consists of two non - imaging instruments ( the pin and gso  see takahashi et al .",
    "2007 ) with a combined bandpass of @xmath24  kev . both of the hxd instruments are background - limited , more so the gso , which has a smaller effective area than the pin . for agns ,",
    "the source count rate is typically much less than the background and in the present study we used only the pin data , as the gso data did not provide a reliable spectrum . in order to obtain a background - subtracted spectrum ,",
    "the background spectrum must be modeled as a function of energy and time .",
    "the background model for the hxd / pin has an advertised systematic uncertainty of 1.3% .",
    "however , the signal is background - dominated , and the source count rate may be a small fraction of the background count rate , so the net systematic error in the background - subtracted spectra could be significant .",
    "the observation of mkn  3 was optimized for the hxd in terms of positioning the source at the aim point for the hxd ( the so - called `` hxd - nominal pointing '' ) which gives a somewhat lower count - rate in the xis than the `` xis - nominal '' pointing , but gives @xmath25 higher hxd effective area .",
    "the principal data selection and screening criteria for the xis were the selection of only _ asca _ grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 , the removal of flickering pixels with the ftool cleansis , and exclusion of data taken during satellite passages through the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) , as well as for time intervals less than @xmath26  s after passages through the saa , using the t_saa_hxd house - keeping parameter .",
    "data were also rejected for earth elevation angles ( elv ) less than @xmath27 , earth day - time elevation angles ( dye_elv ) less than @xmath28 , and values of the magnetic cut - off rigidity ( cor ) less than 6 @xmath29 .",
    "residual uncertainties in the xis energy scale are on the order of 0.2% or less ( or @xmath30  ev at 6.4  kev  see koyama et al .",
    "the cleaning and data selection resulted in net exposure times that are reported in table  1 .",
    "we extracted xis spectra of mkn  3 by using a circular extraction region with a radius of 3.5. background xis spectra were made from off - source areas of the detector , after removing a circular region with a radius of 4.5 centered on the source , and the calibration sources ( using rectangular masks ) .",
    "the xis spectra from all four detectors ( xis0 , xis1 , xis2 , and xis3 ) were combined into a single spectrum for spectral fitting .",
    "instrument response matrix functions ( rmf ) and the ancillary response functions ( arf ) were made and combined into a single response file using standard procedures ( e.g. see appendix of yaqoob , 2012 ) .",

    "the source has no optical counterpart identification and its distance is unknown .",
    "it is too close to mkn  3 to exclude in the _ suzaku _ data , since the psf has a half - power diameter that is comparable to the separation of mkn  3 and ixo  30 .",

    "( 2005 ) , using _ xmm - newton _ data , established that ixo  30 is not variable and contributed only 7% of the total flux in the 0.42  kev band ( with a power - law photon index of 1.77 ) . since our spectral analysis for mkn  3 is not focussed on the soft x - ray spectrum , this level of contamination will not have an impact on our conclusions .",
    "the energy bandpass used for the spectrum from each instrument was determined by the systematics of the background subtraction .",
    "for the xis , the bandpass 0.539.3  kev was used , for which the background was less than 50% of the source counts in any spectral bin , and in the range 0.658.45  kev the background never exceeded 25% of the source counts in any spectral bin .",
    "the width of the bins for the xis data was 30  ev up to 8.0  kev , and 60  ev above 8 kev . with this spectral binning ,",
    "all bins in the 0.539.30  kev range had greater than 20 counts , enabling the use of the @xmath18 statistic for spectral fitting .",
    "( we avoid grouping spectral bins using a signal - to - noise ratio threshold because it can `` wash out '' absorption features . )",
    "in addition to omitting data on the basis of background - subtraction systematics , we also omitted some spectral data that are subject to calibration uncertainties in the effective area due to certain atomic features .",
    "it is known that the effective area calibration is poor in the ranges @xmath31  kev ( due to si in the detectors ) and @xmath32  kev ( au m edges due to the telescopes ) .",
    "the effective area also has a significant , steep change at @xmath33  kev ( due to al in the telescopes ) .",
    "given that the mkn  3 spectrum below @xmath11  kev is rich with line emission ( e.g. sako et al .",
    "2000 ; pounds et al . 2005 ; bianchi et al . 2005 ) , making interpretation of modeling in the regions of calibration uncertainties difficult , we took the conservative approach of omitting xis data in the 1.502.4  kev band for the purpose of spectral fitting .",
    "for the hxd / pin , negative counts in the background - subtracted spectral bins clearly indicate a breakdown of the background model .",
    "we found that the spectral data in the energy range 14.2545.0  kev produced greater than 20 counts per bin ( after background subtraction ) , for bin widths of 0.375  kev below 35.0  kev and 0.75  kev above 35  kev .",
    "this gives the most reliable hxd / pin spectrum with minimal binning whilst at the same time qualifying the spectrum for spectral fitting using the @xmath18 statistic .",
    "the final energy ranges selected for spectral fitting for each instrument are summarized in table  1 , along with the corresponding count rates .",
    "the calibration of the relative cross - normalizations of the xis and pin data involves many factors , and these have been discussed in detail in the appendix of yaqoob ( 2012 ) . for the present _ suzaku _ observation of mkn  3",

    "the line - of - sight column density from the mytorus model , @xmath39 , is @xmath2 , and the global column density out of the line - of - sight , @xmath40 , is @xmath1 ( see table  3 ) .",
    "these column densities are entirely consistent with the corresponding values obtained from the decoupled mytorus model fitted to the data above @xmath41  kev ( table  2 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath42 in table  3 is @xmath43 , or @xmath44 higher than the value obtained from the high - energy fits .",
    "however , it can be seen , by comparing the spectral decomposition for the two fits in fig .",
    "[ fig : highemytufspec](b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : fullbandufspec](a ) , that the absolute flux level of the compton - scattered continuum is essentially the same for the two fits .",
    "since @xmath42 is a parameter that controls the flux level of the compton - scattered continuum _ relative _ to the intrinsic continuum , the absolute flux of the compton - scattered continuum is controlled by the product of the normalization of the intrinsic continuum and @xmath42 .",
    "we see from table  2 and table  3 that the photon index , @xmath45 , of the intrinsic continuum for the broadband fit is significantly flatter than that for the high - energy fit , and the normalization at 1  kev of the intrinsic continuum for the broadband fit is consequently lower than that for the high - energy fit .",
    "thus , a higher value of @xmath42 is required in the broadband fit to maintain the same absolute flux level of the compton - scattered continuum , and the different values of @xmath42 have an insignificant impact on the inferred global column densities .",
    "the reason for the flatter intrinsic continuum for the broadband fit will be discussed below , in  [ continua ] .",
    "it is important to note that all of the column densities out of the line - of - sight that we have obtained for the x - ray reprocessor are _ compton - thin _",
    ", for both the bn11 spherical model and the mytorus model .",
    "( recall that for the coupled mytorus model , the equatorial column density obtained from the fit must by multiplied by @xmath46 to obtain the mean column density averaged over incident angles . )",
    "moreover , the values of the line - of - sight column density obtained from the various fits are either only just , or nearly compton - thick . in the broadband fit with the decoupled mytorus model , the global mean column density in mkn  3 is a long way ( a factor of @xmath3 ) from being compton - thick .",
    "reflection from compton - thin matter has a different spectral shape to that from a disc with infinite column density that is commonly used to model agn spectra .",
    "[ fig : fullbandufspec ] shows that the compton - thin reflection component that we infer in from the mytorus broadband fit for mkn  3 ( blue curves ) is not negligible , and in fact dominates the spectrum in the @xmath47  kev band , it being larger than both the zeroth - order ( line - of - sight ) absorbed continuum and the continuum from distant scattering .",
    "it is principally the fe  k@xmath0 emission line and the continuum curvature below @xmath48  kev that constrains this compton - thin reflection continuum .",
    "the excellent quality of the fit in the fe  k band shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fullbanddatzoom](c ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : fullbanddatzoom](d ) is particularly noteworthy , considering that the fe  k@xmath0 line , fe  k@xmath4 line , and fe  k edge are all determined self - consistently relative to the reflection continuum so they were not allowed to change independently of the reflection continuum .",
    "( note that the parameter @xmath42 varies the reflection continuum and fe  k@xmath0 and fe  k@xmath4 lines _ all together _ and does not allow the continuum and lines to be independent . ) in order to further illustrate the statistical significance of the result that the line - of - sight and global column densities in mkn  3 obtained from the decoupled mytorus fit are very different , in fig .",
    "[ fig : nhsvsnhzcontour ] we show the joint , two - parameter 68% , 90% , and 99% confidence contours of @xmath40 versus @xmath39 .",
    "it can be seen that the constraints on both column densities are robust even at the 99% confidence level .    in a clumpy medium",
    "the compton - scattered reflection continuum from individual clumps can take on a variety of shapes , depending on the average column density of the clump , the direction of the observer s line - of - sight relative to the direction of the illuminating intrinsic continuum , and the obscuration by other clumps .",
    "the shape of the reflection continuum will lie between the two extreme cases corresponding to the compton - scattered photons being observed from the same or opposite side of the clump relative to the illuminating continuum ( e.g. see yaqoob 2012 , liu & lu 2014 ) .",
    "considering the entire clumpy matter distribution , the first of the two extremes could correspond to a situation in which the reflection continuum is dominated by the reflection continuum from the back - side illumination of clumps on the opposite side of the x - ray source , relative to the observer , reaching the observer through unblocked patches , or `` holes , '' in the near - side of the matter distribution .",
    "the other extreme could correspond to the reflection continuum being dominated by compton - scattered photons escaping from the near - side of the matter distribution , from surfaces that are on the sides opposite to the illuminated surfaces .",
    "the latter scenario can be thought of as `` transmitted reflection . '' in the optically - thin limit that compton - scattered photons experience only one scattering and no further interaction with the clumpy matter distribution , the two extreme cases described above will result in reflection spectra that are indistinguishable .",
    "thus , as the column density of the distribution is varied from being compton - thick to compton - thin , the reflection continuum shape will depend less and less on the detailed geometrical distribution , filling factor , and size of the clumps . using the mytorus model",
    "we can approximately mimic the two extremes described above with a face - on inclination angle and an edge - on inclination angle , corresponding to clumps observed predominantly by back - side reflection and `` transmitted reflection '' respectively ( see fig .  6 in yaqoob 2012 , and the associated discussion ) .    in the decoupled mytorus fit to the broadband mkn  3 data described earlier ( see table  3 ) ,",
    "the inclination angle of the torus was set to face - on , corresponding to one of the two extremes outlined above . from this",
    ", we found a column density that is compton - thin , @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , in light of the earlier discussion , if we set the torus inclination angle to edge - on , we should expect to obtain a similar column density ( but note that compton - thin does not equate with optically - thin since the optical depth is energy - dependent ) .",
    "we performed such a fit ( torus inclination angle set to @xmath50 ) and indeed obtained a similar column density , @xmath51 .",
    "the fit was not as good as the face - on case but still acceptable ( @xmath52 , for 281 degrees of freedom , the same number as for the face - on case ) .",
    "we obtained a line - of - sight column density of @xmath53 , or @xmath25 higher than the face - on case .",
    "the value of @xmath42 was @xmath54 , or @xmath55 higher than the face - on case .",
    "the higher value is a result of the edge - on `` transmitted reflection '' spectrum being more suppressed relative to the intrinsic continuum than the back - side reflection spectrum for the face - on case .",
    "we conclude that the average global column density of the x - ray reprocessor in mkn  3 inferred from the mytorus fits is compton - thin and of the order of @xmath56 regardless of the detailed geometry and orientation of the reprocessor .",
    "table  3 shows that the fe  k@xmath0 line flux and ew were measured to be @xmath57 , and @xmath58  ev respectively , where the ew was calculated with respect to the total continuum at the line peak ( in the agn frame ) .",
    "the fe  k@xmath0 line is unresolved with the xis , and the upper limit obtained on the line width ( fwhm@xmath59 ) is consistent with the _ chandra _ heg measurement of @xmath12 reported in shu et al .",

    "( 2005 ) stated that inclusion of the shoulder did not result in a statistical improvement of the fit .",
    "we note that the expected ratio of the flux in the compton shoulder to that in the line core from compton - thick matter is @xmath68 , depending on the geometry and orientation of the line - emitting structure ( e.g. see george & fabian 1991 ; matt 2002 ; yaqoob & murphy 2010 ) .",

    "however , even if the fe  k@xmath0 line were formed in compton - thick matter , it has been shown in yaqoob & murphy ( 2010 ) that if the velocity broadening of the fe  k@xmath0 line , _ or _ the detector spectral resolution , is larger than @xmath69  fwhm , the compton shoulder will be rendered too smeared to be detectable , even in principle .",

    "amongst the high - energy fits described in  [ highenergyfits ] , only the pure spherical model gave an intrinsic continuum flatter than this ( table  2 , column 3 ) .",
    "the reason for the flatter intrinsic continuum in the broadband fit is that the steep rise in the observed spectrum below @xmath11  kev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fullbandufspec ] ) is accommodated by the thermal continuum emission ( apec model component ) and this forces the intrinsic continuum at low energies to be pushed down in flux . without the soft thermal component , a single , steeper power - law continuum can not simultaneously accommodate the soft low - energy spectrum and the hard high - energy spectrum .",
    "although statistical studies have shown that the average intrinsic photon index is characteristically @xmath72 for both type  1 and type  2 agn ( e.g. dadina 2007 , 2008 , and references therein ) , those results do show a range in @xmath45 of 1.52.5 , with a non - negligible number of outliers even outside this range .",

    "results for high statistical quality data for individual sources and small samples are now beginning to emerge ( e.g. see brightman et al . 2015 and references therein ) , but further work is required to establish robust parameter distributions .    from table  3 it can be seen that the fraction of the intrinsic power - law continuum required to produce the optically - thin , distant - matter scattered continuum is @xmath73 , which is within the range generally observed in seyfert 2 galaxies ( e.g. turner et al .",
    "the value of @xmath74 obtained from the broadband decoupled mytorus fit is nearly a factor of 2 larger than the corresponding value obtained from the decoupled mytorus high - energy fit ( @xmath75 , see table  2 ) .",

    "[ fig : fullbandufspec](a ) respectively , we see that the absolute flux of the distant - matter scattered continuum is essentially the same in both cases .",
    "since @xmath74 is a parameter that controls the flux level of the distant - matter power - law continuum _ relative _ to the intrinsic continuum , the absolute flux of the distant - matter continuum is controlled by the product of the normalization of the intrinsic continuum and @xmath74 .",
    "the situation is very similar to that of the parameter @xmath42 being different for the broadband and high - energy fits , and as we discussed earlier , the photon index , @xmath45 , of the intrinsic continuum for the broadband fit is significantly flatter than that for the high - energy fit . consequently , the normalization of the intrinsic continuum at 1  kev for the broadband fit is lower than that for the high - energy fit .",

    "these luminosities are sensitive to the value of @xmath45 , which complicates comparison with the corresponding luminosities in the literature that were obtained using the ad hoc models , which yield different values of @xmath45 . also , since the ad hoc models have an adjustable parameter for the compton - thick reflection continuum amplitude , a model that is globally compton - thin will not necessary yield an intrinsic luminosity that is smaller than previous analyses that assumed compton - thick reflection . in fact , using the same _ suzaku _ data as in the present study , awaki et al .",

    "the difference can be attributed largely to the smaller value of @xmath45 that we obtained from broadband mytorus fit .",
    "this can easily be demonstrated by calculating the luminosity of the intrinsic power law with @xmath90 ( closer to the value obtained by awaki et al .",

    "the latter corresponds to the increase in @xmath18 when the associated line is removed , and the model re - fitted .",
    "this gives some indication of the statistical significance of each line component . in this context",
    ", we note that a value of @xmath38 of 11.83 corresponds to a confidence level of @xmath96 for two interesting parameters .",

    "however , as stated earlier , due to the limited spectral resolution of ccd detectors , some of the gaussian model components may be blends of two or more features , or even artifacts of incorrect modeling of the soft x - ray spectrum .",
    "our intention is not to attempt a detailed analysis of the soft x - ray spectrum since this has already been done with higher spectral resolution instruments ( sako et al .",

    "2008 ) , have not reported the detection of any absorption lines at all , only emission lines .",
    "it is very likely that the absorption line reported in table  4 in the present study is an artifact of our overly simplistic modeling .",
    "in particular the combination of the optically - thin thermal continuum , in conjunction with other continuum components , could conspire to produce an artificial absorption trough .",
    "we note that the model used by awaki et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for the same _ suzaku _ data as in the present study , did not include an optically - thin thermal model component , but only gaussian model components .",
    "also , the observed energy of the line , @xmath100  kev , compared to the expected @xmath101  kev would imply a redshift , yet such photoionized gas in agn is characteristically observed in outflow ( e.g. laha et al .",
    "2014 , and references therein ) .",
    "it can be seen from table  4 that the ni  k@xmath0 fluorescent line energy measured from the _ suzaku _ data , namely @xmath102  kev , is consistent with the theoretical value of @xmath103  kev ( e.g. , bearden 1967 ) .",
    "the ew of the ni  k@xmath0 line is @xmath104  ev , a factor of @xmath11 larger than the calculated monte carlo value appropriate for the decoupled mytorus fit ( see yaqoob & murphy 2011b ) , suggestive of an overabundance of ni relative to the anders and grevesse ( 1989 ) solar value .",
    "we have revisited the _ suzaku _ x - ray spectrum of the seyfert  2 galaxy mkn  3 to investigate the distribution of circumnuclear matter ( the x - ray reprocessor ) , using models that self - consistently account for the `` neutral , '' narrow , fe  k@xmath0 emission line , and compton reflection of the continuum and line emission .",
    "our methodology is able to disentangle the column density in the line - of - sight from the global average column density .",
    "our conclusions are summarized below .    1",
    ".   we tested the data against a uniform spherical distribution using the model of brightman and nandra ( 2011 ) , and obtained a radial column density of @xmath105 .",
    "however , the fit was very poor and the model could not produce the correct continuum shape whilst simultaneously accounting for the fe  k@xmath0 line , even when we allowed the fe abundance to be a free parameter .",
    "the fit can be improved by adding additional continuum components and absorbers but the model is then no longer that of a uniform , spherically symmetric distribution .",
    "2 .   applying the mytorus model of murphy and yaqoob ( 2009 ) in `` coupled mode , '' yielded an equatorial column density of @xmath106 and an inclination angle of @xmath107 for the toroidal structure , but again , the fit was not satisfactory , due to the lack of a self - consistent solution for the continuum and fe  k@xmath0 line .",
    "3 .   applying the mytorus model in `` decoupled mode",
    ", '' gave an excellent fit , and the best description of the data , yielding a global column density , @xmath40 , of @xmath108 that is very different to the line - of - sight column density , @xmath39 , of @xmath2 .",
    "a physical picture consistent with this model is that of a patchy or clumpy distribution in which most lines of sight that intercept any material typically have a column density of @xmath40 , but the line - of - sight that is relevant for us happens to have a column density that is a factor of @xmath13 higher than the global average .",
    "this could be due to chance fluctuations of material migrating in and out of our line - of - sight , or to a systematic thickening of the distribution towards an equatorial plane that is observed edge - on or close to edge - on . in the former case",
    ", fluctuations in the line - of - sight column density should of the order of the average global column density or less , but in the latter case the fluctuations should be larger than the average global column density",
    ". detailed self - consistent modeling of the fe  k@xmath0 line and reflection continuum with future monitoring observations with _ astro - h _ could potentially distinguish between the two scenarios .",
    "4 .   in the above fit with the mytorus model ,",
    "the x - ray reflection continuum originates in compton - thin matter , and its shape is very different to the `` standard '' compton - reflection spectrum from an infinite disc with infinite column density , that is commonly used to fit agn x - ray spectra .",
    "our fits suggest that the reflected continuum and fluorescent line emission are observed from the back - side of matter on the `` far - side '' of the distribution , through `` holes '' on the side closest to the observer .",
    "5 .   in our compton - thin reflection model for mkn  3 ,",
    "the high - energy spectrum is _ not _ reflection dominated . above @xmath109",
    "kev , the reflection continuum is negligible and the spectrum is dominated by the line - of - sight absorption . therefore the high - energy spectrum is essentially the direct , intrinsic continuum .",
    "we applied the mytorus model described above in two energy bands , @xmath11045  kev , and @xmath2045  kev , the latter including additional soft x - ray model components .",
    "we obtained consistent results for the global and line - of - sight column densities for both fits .",
    "thus , considering agn x - ray spectra in general , one could expect to obtain reliable constraints on the line - of - sight and global column densities , at least to a reasonable approximation , without having to consider the often considerable complexities of the soft x - ray spectrum .",
    "( however , we note that the relative magnitude of the continuum from distant , optically - thin scattering _ is _ highly model - dependent . )",
    "the _ suzaku _ data are consistent with a solar abundance of fe .",
    "we note that the fe abundance can not trivially be deduced from the magnitude of the discontinuity at the fe  k edge since the `` edge - depth '' depends on the geometry and column - dependent radiative transfer of continuum photons .",
    "the mytorus model self - consistently calculates the compton shoulder of the fe  k@xmath0 and fe  k@xmath4 lines , so it is already included in the model .",
    "our best description of the _ suzaku _ data with the mytorus model indicates that the matter distribution is globally compton - thin so the flux of the compton shoulder is only @xmath66 of the fe  k@xmath0 line core and that the data are consistent in detail with the model . in previous works ,",
    "attempts to reconcile the fe  k@xmath0 line profile with a compton - reflection continuum that was assumed to originate in an infinite disc with an infinite column density resulted in the expectation that the ratio of the compton shoulder flux to that in the line core should be a factor of @xmath111 higher than was observed . 9 .",
    "the flux of the fe  k@xmath4 line in the mytorus is self - consistently determined by the model and is not adjustable .",
    "we obtained an excellent fit to the fe  k@xmath4 line in the data with the decoupled mytorus model , despite no empirical adjustments of its flux relative to the fe  k@xmath0 line .",
    "our analysis also addresses the `` puzzling '' lack of correlation between the fe  k@xmath0 line flux and the magnitude of the compton - reflection continuum reported by guainazzi et al .",
    "their analysis insisted that the reflection continuum is from compton - thick matter , which forced them to conclude that the fe  k@xmath0 line originates in a separate compton - thin medium , whilst the fe  k@xmath0 line from the compton - thick matter must be suppressed .",
    "however they were not able to offer an explanation for such suppression .",
    "guainazzi et al .",
    "( 2012 ) also stated that the reflection continuum from the compton - thin matter is unobservable .",
    "however , they did not fit compton - thin models of the reflection continuum and fe  k@xmath0 line to support that assertion .",
    "in contrast , we fitted self - consistent models that make no presumptions about the column density of matter producing the reflection continuum and the fe  k@xmath0 line .",
    "we found that the global matter distribution is compton - thin and its reflection continuum is observable .",
    "the situation of a lack of correlation between the fe  k@xmath0 line flux and compton - reflection can never arise in analyses using the self - consistent models that we applied because the physical relationship is built in from the outset .",
    "we also note that an argument sometimes used to support the assumption of a compton - thick reflection continuum is the observation of a high infrared to x - ray continuum ratio , and this was also invoked by guainazzi et al .",
    "( 2012 ) for mkn  3 .",
    "however , yaqoob & murphy ( 2011a ) have shown that the infrared to x - ray ratio is not uniquely determined by the column density of the reprocessor , but has just as important a dependence on its covering factor and on the hardness of the intrinsic x - ray continuum .",
    "they further showed that it is possible for a compton - thin reprocessor to produce an infrared to x - ray ratio that can be comparable to , or actually larger , than that produced by a compton - thick reprocessor .",
    "our analysis reveals the important role played by _ compton - thin _ x - ray reflection from finite - column - density matter in constraining the average global column density of the matter distribution responsible for producing the narrow fe  k@xmath0 emission line in agn .",
    "compton - thin reflection exhibits a richer variety of spectral shapes than the commonly - used , disc - reflection spectrum , which assumes an infinite column density .",
    "the x - ray reflection spectrum from finite - column - density material can peak at lower energies than the infinite - column - density counterpart .",
    "in mkn  3 , according to the spectral - fitting results with the mytorus model , the compton - thin reflection spectrum is the dominant continuum in the @xmath47  kev band .",
    "it is noteworthy that the mytorus fit to the fe  k@xmath0 line , fe  k@xmath4 line , and the fe  k edge region , is so good ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fullbanddatzoom ] ) that there is no suggestion that any more complexity is required , in addition to the mundane , nonrelativistic , physics of the model .",
    "the fit in the critical fe  k region was achieved without any free parameters that adjust the fe  k@xmath0 line , fe  k@xmath4 line , or the fe  k edge with respect to the compton - reflection continuum .",
    "our results are also relevant for the study of so - called `` changing - look '' agn , which are reported to change from being compton - thick to compton - thin , or vice - versa .",
    "the phenomenon has commonly been interpreted in terms of transits of clumpy material across the line - of - sight ( e.g. matt , guainazzi & maiolino 2003 ; risaliti et al .",
    "2010 , and references therein ) , but traditional modeling has been restricted by the assumption that the global matter distribution is compton - thick .",
    "this global distribution contributes an underlying reflection spectrum that is often non - varying whilst the line - of - sight absorption spectrum varies .",
    "the possibility that the global matter distribution is compton - thin then leads to a richer phenomenology that could be observable in changing - look agn .",
    "indeed , such a case has already been found from a _ suzaku _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and _ swift _ observation campaign of the type  2 agn , ngc  454 ( marchese et al . 2012 ) .",
    "spectral fitting with the mytorus model showed that a compton - thin reflection component ( from a global matter distribution with a column density of @xmath112 ) remained steady whilst the line - of - sight column density varied between @xmath113 and @xmath14 . in the `` transiting clumps '' scenario ,",
    "no `` shutting - down '' or `` powering up '' of the central engine is required to explain the apparent transitions : the average compton - thin or compton - thick global matter distribution remains steady over time , only the amount of matter in the line - of - sight fluctuates .",
    "this picture is also consistent with the findings of markowitz , krumpe , & nikutta ( 2014 ) , who investigated the properties of transient absorption events in agn , leading to constraints on clumpy torus models of the circumnuclear matter distribution . in the transiting clump model of spectral variability ,",
    "changing - look agn are not members of a special class of agn .",
    "rather , they are a loosely defined subset of agn in which the difference between the line - of - sight and global column densities happens to be large enough to cause transitions between two `` extremal '' spectral states , one that is compton - thick and the other compton - thin . other agn , which may constitute a majority , in which the contrast between the line - of - sight and global column densities is less severe , would exhibit more moderate spectral variability , insufficient to classify them as changing - look agn .",
    "nevertheless , the transiting matter interpretation of changing - look agn can not be universal , as lamassa et al .",
    "( 2015 ) have presented a detailed multiwaveband study of a type 1 quasar to type 1.9 agn transition that can not be explained by variable line - of - sight absorption , but instead is attributed to variable ionization of the matter surrounding the central source .",
    "the clumpy nature of the torus that is increasingly becoming apparent from x - ray observations has also been inferred from theoretical work on the infrared properties of agn ( e.g. elitzur 2008 ; nenkova et al .",
    "2008 , 2010 ) .",
    "in particular , nenkova et al .",
    "( 2008 ) note that observations imply a clumpy medium because it can produce `` isotropic infrared emission but highly anisotropic obscuration . ''",
    "nevertheless , it has been argued by feltre et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , based on a detailed study of smooth and clumpy models , that ambiguities still exist because the two types of model depend on very different assumptions . regardless of the clumpiness of the x - ray reprocessor , it will be important to determine for a larger sample of type  2 agn , how common it is for the mean global column density of the x - ray reprocessor to be very different to the line - of - sight column density .",
    "traditionally , simplistic , one - dimensional models have been fitted to derive column densities , with the implicit assumption that the global column density is the same as the line - of - sight column density . whether or not this is the case clearly has implications for the energy budget for reprocessing x - rays into infrared emission , and for population synthesis models of the cosmic x - ray background .",
