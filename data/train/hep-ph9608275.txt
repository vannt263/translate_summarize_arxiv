    "after the stunning confirmation of the standard model predictions at the tevatron and lep  1 , the field of contenders for the much anticipated ` new physics ' has , in the minds of most , been narrowed down to just one : supersymmetry . however , the many years elapsed since the invention of supersymmetry have produced abundant theoretical speculation as to the specific nature of supersymmetry , its origins , its breaking , and the spectrum of superparticles .",
    "recent observations at the tevatron , in the form of a puzzling @xmath0 event @xcite , appear to indicate that experiment may have finally reached the sensitivity required to observe the first direct manifestations of supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "if this event is indeed the result of an underlying supersymmetric production process , as might be deduced from the observation of additional related events at the tevatron or lep  2 , it will herald a new era in elementary particle physics .",
    "the _ prima facie _ evidence for supersymmetry contains the standard missing - energy characteristic of supersymmetric production processes , but it also contains a surprising hard - photon component ( as far as the minimal supersymmetry standard model is concerned ) , which eliminates all conceivable standard model backgrounds and may prove extremely discriminating among different models of low - energy supersymmetry .",
    "the present supersymmetric explanations of the cdf event fall into two phenomenological classes : either the lightest neutralino ( @xmath13 ) is the lightest supersymmetric particle , and the second - to - lightest neutralino decays radiatively to it at the one - loop level ( @xmath14 ) ; or the gravitino ( @xmath15 ) is the lightest supersymmetric particle , and the lightest neutralino decays radiatively to it at the tree level ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the former ` neutralino - lsp ' scenario requires a configuration of gaugino masses that precludes the usual gaugino mass unification relation of unified models , although it can occur in some restricted region of the mssm parameter space .",
    "the latter ` gravitino - lsp ' scenario requires only that the lightest neutralino has a photino component , as is typically the case in many supersymmetric models . the underlying process that leads to such final states",
    "has been suggested to be that of selectron pair - production ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) , with subsequent decay @xmath19 or @xmath20 in the neutralino - lsp and gravitino - lsp scenarios respectively . in the gravitino - lsp scenario ,",
    "the alternative possibility of chargino pair - production ( @xmath21,@xmath22 ) has also been briefly mentioned @xcite ( this possibility is not available in the neutralino - lsp scenario @xcite ) .",
    "of these two classes of explanations , only the gravitino - lsp one has generated model - building efforts that try to embed such a scenario into a more fundamental theory at higher mass scales .",
    "these more predictive theories include low - energy gauge - mediated dynamical supersymmetry breaking @xcite and no - scale supergravity @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study in detail the kinematics of the observed event in both the selectron and chargino interpretations in the context of our recently proposed _",
    "one - parameter _ no - scale supergravity model @xcite .",
    "we delineate the regions in parameter space that are consistent with the kinematical information , and then consider the rates for the various underlying processes that may occur within such regions of parameter space .",
    "non - observation of related signals ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath23 ) that are predicted to occur at significantly higher rates than the presumably observed one ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath0 ) imposes important constraints on the parameter space of the model .",
    "it should be noted that the possibility of observing supersymmetry at the tevatron via weakly - interacting production processes had been shown early on to be particularly favorable in the context of no - scale supergravity @xcite .",
    "we also consider the constraints from lep  1.5 and the prospects for supersymmetric particle detection at lep161 and lep190 .",
    "we show that one of the acoplanar photon pairs observed by the opal collaboration at lep  1.5 may be attributable to supersymmetry in the present model via @xmath7 .",
    "we should remark that because of the rather restrictive nature of our one - parameter model , our experimental predictions are unambiguous and highly correlated .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we review the basic model predictions and expand on the motivation for our model and its significance in the context of no - scale supergravity , flipped su(5 ) , and extended supergravities . in sec .  [",
    "sec : events ] we consider the cdf event from the perspective of the selectron and chargino interpretation , delineate the allowed regions in parameter space , and contrast the rates for related processes that might have been observed . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lep ] we determine the constraints from lep  1.5 , study in some detail the opal acoplanar photon events , and explore the prospects for particle detection at lep  2 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "supergravity models are described in terms of two functions , the khler function @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the khler potential and @xmath26 the superpotential ; and the gauge kinetic function @xmath27 .",
    "specification of these functions determines the supergravity interactions and the soft supersymmetry - breaking parameters that arise after spontaneous breaking of supergravity , which is parametrized by the gravitino mass @xmath28 . in standard supergravity scenarios the choices for @xmath29 and @xmath27 may follow from symmetry considerations or",
    "may be calculated in certain weakly - coupled heterotic string vacua ( such as orbifolds or free - fermionic constructions ) . in these cases",
    "one generically obtains soft - supersymmetry - breaking parameters ( _ i.e. _ , scalar and gaugino masses and scalar interactions ) that are comparable to the gravitino mass : @xmath30 , although the specific proportionality coefficients in these relations may vary in magnitude and may even be non - universal . in the context of unified models , such standard scenarios do not appear to be consistent with a supersymmetric explanation of the cdf @xmath0 event because , either the implied gaugino mass unification is violated ( neutralino - lsp scenario ) , or the required light gravitino mass ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath31 ) would render all supersymmetric particles comparably light ( gravitino - lsp scenario ) .    in the gravitino - lsp scenario ,",
    "the main issue is that of _ decoupling _ the breaking of local supersymmetry ( parametrized by @xmath32 ) from the breaking of global supersymmetry ( parametrized by @xmath33 ) . this decoupling is achieved _ naturally _ in the context of no - scale supergravity @xcite , where a judicious choice of the khler potential ( @xmath25 ) yields @xmath34 ( and also @xmath35 ) , which allows a very wide range of @xmath32 values .",
    "( no - scale supergravity is also obtained in weakly - coupled string models , as was shown early on by witten @xcite and has more recently been explored in great detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) without this ( scalar - sector ) decoupling , sizeable values of @xmath36 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath37 ) can not be obtained in the light gravitino scenario .",
    "as we discuss below , the selectron interpretation of the cdf event requires @xmath38 @xcite , but there is no such requirement for the chargino interpretation . in this connection",
    "we should add that in unified models the possible values of @xmath39 are constrained by the proton decay rate via dimension - five operators . in the minimal su(5 ) supergravity model one can show that @xmath40 is required @xcite , thus rendering this decoupling impossible .",
    "in contrast , in flipped su(5 ) such operators are naturally suppressed , and @xmath41 is perfectly allowed @xcite .      the remaining and crucial question is the decoupling in the gaugino sector , that depends on the choice of @xmath27 , at least in traditional supergravity models .",
    "the gaugino masses are given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 represents the hidden sector ( moduli ) fields in the model , and the gaugino mass universality at the planck scale is insured by a gauge - group independent choice for @xmath27 .",
    "as remarked above , the usual expressions for @xmath27 ( _ e.g. _ , in weakly - coupled string models ) give @xmath44 .",
    "this result is however avoided by considering the non - minimal choice @xmath45 , where @xmath46 are constants @xcite .",
    "assuming the standard no - scale expression @xmath47 , one can then readily show that @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the rescaled planck mass .",
    "the phenomenological requirement of @xmath50 then implies @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "note that @xmath53 gives the relation @xmath54 , which was obtained very early on in ref .",
    "@xcite from the perspective of hierarchical supersymmetry breaking in extended n=8 supergravity .",
    "the recent theoretical impetus for supersymmetric m - theory in 11 dimensions may also lend support to this result , as n=1 in d=11 corresponds to n=8 in d=4 .    more specifically , the needed decoupling between the local and global breaking of supersymmetry , that we have advocated above in order to insure a light gravitino , appears to be realized in strongly coupled heterotic strings @xcite , which are best understood in terms of 11-dimensional supergravity .",
    "moreover , the no - scale supergravity structure appears to also emerge in strongly - coupled strings @xcite and to take on a crucial role in suppressing the cosmological constant at the classical @xcite and quantum levels @xcite , as well as avoiding flavor - changing neutral currents @xcite .",
    "these general remarks should sufficiently motivate our present phenomenological study .",
    "our model effectively fits within the usual no - scale supergravity models with universal soft - supersymmetry - breaking parameters given by @xmath55 when the constraints from radiative electroweak symmetry breaking are imposed , the values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 are determined ( for the fixed value of @xmath58 ) .",
    "evolving the latter up to the planck scale , and demanding that it reproduce the boundary condition @xmath59 , determines the value of @xmath60 in terms of the single parameter of the model ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "one can show that the sign of @xmath62 is also determined by this procedure @xcite .",
    "the precise low - energy spectrum of the model further depends on the details of the evolution between the planck scale and the electroweak scale .",
    "one may envision a traditional scenario where unification occurs at the usual gut scale ( @xmath63 ) , while supersymmetry breaking is communicated to the observable sector at the planck scale .",
    "alternatively one may supplement the mssm spectrum with intermediate - scale particles that delay unification up to the planck scale @xcite .",
    "a third and perhaps more realistic scenario combines both approaches and has been recently realized in flipped su(5 ) @xcite , achieving a partial unification at @xmath64 [ su(2)@xmath65su(3)@xmath66su(5 ) ] and string unification at @xmath67 . however , this scenario depends on various parameters which make the analysis more complicated that needs to be at this stage . here",
    "we opt for the second scenario , where unification occurs in a single step at the planck scale .",
    "we expect that our numerical results will remain qualitatively unchanged in any of these three possible unification scenarios .",
    "the spectrum as a function of the lightest neutralino mass is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : light ] for the lighter particles ( sleptons , lightest higgs boson , lighter neutralinos and charginos ) and in fig .",
    "[ fig : heavy ] for the heavier particles ( gluino , squarks , heavy higgs bosons , heavier neutralinos and charginos ) .",
    "the calculated value of @xmath60 as a function of @xmath68 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : light ] . we also find that @xmath69 , which can then be obtained from fig .",
    "[ fig : heavy ] .",
    "these figures show that the lightest neutralino ( which is mostly bino ) is always the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nslp ) , followed by the right - handed sleptons ( @xmath70 ) , the lighter neutralino / chargino ( @xmath71 ) , the sneutrino ( @xmath72 ) , and the left - handed sleptons ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "( the order of the second and third elements on this list is reversed for very light neutralino masses . )",
    "note the splitting between the selectron / smuon masses and the stau mass due to the non - negligible value of the @xmath74 yukawa coupling .",
    "the lightest higgs boson crosses all sparticle lines and is in the range @xmath75 . also notable",
    "is that the average squark mass ( @xmath76 ) is slightly below the gluino mass ( @xmath77 ) and the lightest top - squark ( @xmath78 ) is somewhat lighter than both of these .",
    "as emphasized early on @xcite , the dominant decay of the lightest neutralino is via @xmath79 , which has partial a width of @xcite @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the square of the photino admixture of the lightest neutralino . in our model @xmath82 for @xmath83 , with a maximum value of 0.74 , attained asymptotically",
    "when the lightest neutralino approaches a pure bino .",
    "the decay @xmath84 , accessible for @xmath85 , is greatly suppressed by the @xmath86 threshold behavior @xcite ; we find @xmath87 .",
    "the decay @xmath88 may also be accessible ( for @xmath89 ) but it is completely negligible because of the above kinematical suppression and because of the gaugino nature of the neutralino . in sum , we expect @xmath90 throughout the whole parameter space .",
    "one can also consider the probability for @xmath13 ( with energy @xmath91 ) to travel a distance @xmath92 before decaying @xmath93 , where the decay length is given by @xcite @xmath94 the requirement @xmath95 ensures a visible neutralino decay within the cdf ( or any other such ) detector @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the implications of the observed cdf @xmath0 event , assuming that it is the result of an underlying supersymmetric production process in the context of our present model .",
    "the particulars of the event are listed in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "we consider two interpretations ( selectron and chargino pair production ) , in each case delineating the region in parameter space consistent with the observed kinematics of the event .",
    "we then determine the rate for such processes and for related processes with similar signatures that might have also been detected .      in this interpretation",
    "one assumes that the underlying process is @xmath96 or @xmath97 , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fd - sleptons](a ) and [ fig : fd - sleptons](b ) respectively .",
    "the selectrons subsequently decay via @xmath98 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fd - sleptons](e ) ] with @xmath99 branching ratio , ; @xmath100 . in the present model",
    "we find that @xmath101 is only accessible for @xmath102 ( and then suppressed by phase space ) , which is outside of the range of interest .",
    "also , @xmath103 may always decay in all three ways ( although @xmath104 has the largest phase space ) , but with an electron in the final state almost always ( unless the chargino in @xmath105 decays hadronically ) . ] and the neutralinos further decay via @xmath79 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fd - sleptons](g ) ] , also with @xmath99 branching ratio .",
    "the final state thus contains @xmath106 , with the ( essentially ) massless gravitinos carrying away the missing energy .",
    "the kinematical data shown in table  [ table1 ] constrain the possible masses of the selectron ( @xmath107 ) and neutralino ( @xmath68 ) . to obtain these constraints",
    "we perform a monte carlo simulation of the process in which we vary at random the three - momenta of the unobserved gravitinos , subject to the constraints of transverse momentum conservation ( up the @xmath108 ` vector ' given in table  [ table1 ] ) and equality of neutralino and selectron masses in each decay .",
    "we have considered the two possible pairings of the photons and electrons ( i.e. , which @xmath109 and @xmath110 go with @xmath111 and which go with @xmath112 ) but find that only one pairing satisfies all consistency constraints .",
    "we thus obtain a @xmath113dimensional solution space that parametrizes the two unknown masses .",
    "the resulting allowed region in @xmath114 ) space is found to be partially bounded , and with a sufficiently dense sample of monte carlo points one can determine its boundary , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : event1-sel ] .",
    "the region in principle continues onto larger sparticles masses , but we have cut it off ( vertical line ) at @xmath115 because the predicted rates at the tevatron become uninterestingly small beyond that point . within the closed region",
    "we see that underlying @xmath116 pair - production is disfavored . on the other hand ,",
    "underlying @xmath117 pair - production is perfectly consistent with the kinematics of the event , with the further constraints @xmath118 model mass relations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : light ] ) then imply @xmath119 .",

    "the angle @xmath126 between these two particles is the one free parameter , which is however restricted by momentum conservation .",
    "this angle takes its minimum and maximum values when the momenta of the photon ( @xmath127 ) and the gravitino ( @xmath128 ) are coplanar with the sum of the two photon momenta ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "this can be visualized by considering the plane formed by the two gravitino momenta ( @xmath130 ) and @xmath129 . on this plane",
    "all vectors and their directions are completely determined by momentum conservation .",
    "however , the plane defined by @xmath131 may rotate around the @xmath129 axis .",

    "we find @xmath139 and @xmath140 , giving @xmath141 and thus @xmath142 ( compared to the naive range @xmath143 obtained by neglecting momentum conservation ) .",
    "should candidate acoplanar photon pair events be identified at lep  2 , the above analysis would determine the range of consistent neutralino masses , with their most likely value very near @xmath144 ( _ i.e _ , when @xmath145 ) .",
    "motivated by the puzzling cdf @xmath0 event , we have studied two different interpretations within the context of our recently proposed one - parameter no - scale supergravity model with a light gravitino .",
    "we considered both a selectron pair - production interpretation and a chargino pair - production interpretation .",
    "the former is consistent with the kinematics and dynamics of the event only for @xmath146 , with some further constraints . in the context of this model",
    "we do not expect that more such events should turn up , unless many more similar events with a single lepton are also identified .",
    "the chargino interpretation can explain the cdf event with more ease and further predicts additional signals that may also be detectable at the same level ( including events with three leptons and two leptons plus two jets ) .",
    "possible observation of any of these accompanying signals will support the model .",
    "we also find that lep  2 is in an ideal position to confirm or disprove the model via the detection of an excess of acoplanar photon pair events .",
    "in fact , we have noticed that one such event with characteristics more of a signal than of a background may have already been detected by opal at lep  1.5    to conclude let us remark that in the case of light enough gravitinos , direct gravitino production at colliders ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath147 ) should provide an additional signal that would have a much greater kinematical reach @xcite .",
