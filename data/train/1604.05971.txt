    "we have argued in @xcite that such an isolation is possible as a result of string dipole - dipole interactions between the ordered water molecules in the interior of the mjt cavities and the neighboring dimer walls . in _ in vivo",
    "_ situations such strong interactions may overcome thermal losses and provide the necessary environmental isolation , as proposed to happen in the cavity model of mt  @xcite , in which a thin ( a few angstrom think ) cavity layer between the mt interior and the dimer wall acts like an isolated cavity , leading to relatively long decoherence time ( up to microseconds , for moderately ( micron long ) mt .    the role of ordered water , and other details of the structure of the mt have been ignored in our treatment above .",
    "it would be interesting to incorporate them in future studies of these systems .",
    "it may well be that once this is done , we can disover more realistic solitonic structures of _ helical shape _ that are responsible for information and signal transduction in a _ dissipation - free _ way . moreover , if such quantum effects are at play , there may be long distance correlations between parts of the mt system ( ` quantum wiring ' ) in analogy with such claimed long lasting ( femtoseconds ) effects in algae  @xcite , as mentioned previously .",
