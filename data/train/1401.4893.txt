    "so far , we have emphasized the fact that the mass - loss rates of sn iin progenitors may tend to increase as they get closer to the time of the explosion",
    ". however , there also exists an exception ( sn 2006jd , see also @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the number of sne iin we show here is small and we are still not at a stage of making a strong statement from them .",
    "more sn iin observations from which we can estimate bolometric lcs and apply our lc model are required to get a clearer view of the sn iin mass loss .",
    "the bolometric lc model we applied to estimate the mass - loss rates so far assumes the spherical symmetry .",
    "however , the deviation from the spherical symmetry is reported in many sne iin ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this section ,",
    "we briefly discuss the effect of the asphericity on the bolometric lcs and the mass - loss rates estimated in this paper .",
    "the significant effect of the csm asphericity on the bolometric lcs is in the reduction of the dense csm decelerating the sn ejecta .",
    "the dense part of the csm exists in all the directions in the spherically symmetric case while the dense part only exists in some directions in the aspherical case .",
    "if the thomson optical depth of the dense csm is less than unity , as is the case for the most sne iin we model here , the photons emitted from the shock will be directly observed .",
    "thus , the bolometric luminosity is presumed to be roughly proportional to the degree of the asymmetry for a given csm density . in other words ,",
    "the bolometric luminosity is expected to be reduced by the amount of the dense csm decreased by the asymmetry for a given csm density . if the dense csm with @xmath150 exists only at the @xmath151 direction out of @xmath152 , the average csm density decreases to @xmath153 . here",
    ", we assume that the density of the sparse part of the csm is significantly smaller than that of the dense part . the effect of the decrease in the average csm density caused by the asphericity on the luminosity is roughly included in the efficiency @xmath22 in our model",
    ". the efficiency will be decreased by @xmath154 by the asymmetry because of the reduction of the average csm density .",
    "this means that the mass - loss rate of the @xmath151 direction should be increased by @xmath155 to get the same luminosity as the spherically symmetric case so that the dense part of the csm will be @xmath156 .",
    "however , even though the mass - loss rate should be increased in the @xmath151 direction to get the same luminosity , the average mass - loss rate remains the same as the mass - loss rate obtained by the spherically symmetric model because the average density of the entire csm becomes @xmath157 .",
    "thus , although the mass - loss rate of a particular direction should be increased , the average mass - loss rate is expected to remain roughly the same as the spherically symmetric case to have the same luminosity in the aspherical case .",
    "if the dense part of the csm is optically thick , the effect of the diffusion in the aspherical csm is presumed to be significant and the aspherical csm can change the lcs more significantly , depending on the viewing angle of the observers .",
    "some bolometric lcs shown in this paper are found to decline much faster than those expected from the analytic model ( sne 2005kj , 2006aa , 1998s , and 2009ip ) . in the case of the optically thin csm",
    ", the deviation from the spherical symmetry is presumed to change the efficiency mainly without changing the lc shape significantly .",
    "in addition , an interesting common property of the fast - declining lcs is that their luminosities decline exponentially .",
    "the exponential decay is not naturally expected from the asphericity of the optically - thin csm . as we discussed earlier",
    ", the exponential decay is naturally expected from the diffusion in the shocked optically - thick dense csm .",
    "interestingly , the bolometric lcs of sne 1998s and 2009ip , whose lc declines are much faster than other sne iin , are suggested to have a large asymmetry @xcite .",
    "since the diffusion process is significantly affected by the asymmetry , these fast declines may be related to the asphericity and the viewing angle of the observers .",
    "we have discussed the possible effect of the deviation from the spherical symmetry assumed in the analytic lc model qualitatively in this section .",
    "however , the aspherical effect should be eventually investigated quantitatively .",
    "we leave this as our future work .",
    "we have presented the results of our systematic study of the csm around sne iin . to estimate the csm properties",
    ", we apply an analytic bolometric lc model for interacting sne formulated in m13 to 11 sn iin bolometric lcs .",
    "we have reconstructed the mass - loss histories of sn iin progenitors based on the estimated csm properties .",
    "as we typically use the bolometric lcs within 200 days since the explosion , we are able to trace the mass - loss histories within about 60 years before the explosion .",
    "we find that mass - loss rates of many sne iin are constantly high ( above @xmath158 @xmath1 ) for more than a decade before their explosion ( fig .",
    "[ masslosshistory ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the eruptive mass loss with shorter timescales observed in several sn iin progenitors is not always a mechanism to make the dense csm .",
    "there should be a mass - loss mechanism which sustains the high mass - loss rates at least for decades before the explosion .",
    "in addition , we find that sn iin progenitors may tend to increase their mass - loss rates as they get closer to the time of the explosion . if this is confirmed , the currently unknown mass - loss mechanism of sn iin progenitors may be related to the core evolution of them .",
    "however , the number of sne iin we modeled is still small and we need more sn iin observations from which we can construct bolometric lcs .",
    "revealing the progenitors of sne iin is important for the understanding of not only sne but also stellar evolution .",
    "sn iin progenitors provide us with a clue to find missing keys in the current stellar evolution theory . some progenitor and mass - loss properties are starting to be revealed as we show here in this paper .",
    "however , we need more efforts to reach a better understanding of them .",
