    "the stellar distributions in galaxies have played a valuable role in guiding our understanding of the galaxies themselves . in particular , the accessibility of high - resolution imaging offered by the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) substantially advanced our appreciation of the complexity of galaxy cores ( e.g.  crane et al .  1993 ; kormendy et al .  1994 ; jaffe et al .",

    "giant stellar evacuation zones are also observed .",
    "luminous galaxies with such shallow cores had of course long been known to exist from ground - based observations ( e.g.  king & minkowski 1966 , 1972 ; king 1978 ; young et al .  1978 ; binney & mamon 1982 ; see the review by graham 2012a ) but _ hst _ enabled us to accurately quantify these .",

    "( 1995 ) largely agreed with the division of galaxies presented in ferrarese et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , referring to them as ` core ' galaxies and ` power - law ' galaxies , respectively .",
    "they also advanced a double power law model which they dubbed the ` nuker law ' for fitting the ( underlying host galaxy ) surface brightness profiles of early - type galaxies .",
    "the nuker model had an additional fifth parameter to moderate the transition between the two power laws  as introduced by hernquist ( 1990 , his eq .",
    "43 ) for modelling the internal density profiles of galaxies .",
    "the physical process(es ) responsible for the observed difference between the inner surface brightness profiles of ` core ' galaxies and the fainter ` power - law ' galaxies ( nowadays referred to as ` srsic ' galaxies because these spheroids have srsic light profiles rather than power - law light profiles ) provide valuable clues about the galaxies past history . in bright galaxies , the widely advocated ` dry ' ( i.e.  gas poor ) galaxy merger hypothesis ( e.g. faber et al .",
    "1997 ) can result in the gravitational sling shot of central stars ( core scouring ) due to the coalescence of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) from the progenitor galaxies ( e.g.  begelman , blandford & rees 1980 ; makino & ebisuzaki 1996 ; merritt & milosavljevi 2005 ; merritt 2006 ) .",
    "it is possible that the sizes and mass deficits of such partially depleted cores may reflect the amount of merging and damage caused by the black holes ( after having eroded any pre - existing nuclear stellar components : bekki & graham 2010 ) .",
    "having an accurate quantification of the physical parameters defining the centers of galaxies is therefore important .",
    "moreover , reliable break radii @xmath10 , used to denote the sizes of the cores , may even be useful for predicting black hole masses ( lauer et al .",
    "2007a ) .    while investigating the lack of any connection between the double power - law model and the curved galaxy brightness profiles observed outside of the cores , graham et al .",
    "( 2003 , see their figures  24 ) revealed that the nuker model s break radius , and other parameters , were not robust quantities but are sensitive to the radial range of the surface brightness profile that is fitted . for example , the break radii @xmath10 were shown to vary by more than a factor of three .",
    "the parameters sensitivity was recognised to arise from the nuker model s efforts to fit an outer power - law to what is actually a curved brightness profile .",
    "the luminosity profiles of bright ( core ) galaxies ( @xmath11 mag )  which show a downward deviation from the inward extrapolation of their outer srsic ( 1963 , 1968 ) profile  were subsequently shown to be precisely represented by the core - srsic model ( graham et al .",

    "( 2003 ) have criticized the nuker @xmath12 as being sensitive to the domain over which the nuker law was fitted , particularly when the outer limit of the fit extends only slightly beyond @xmath12 . in practice , however , the nuker laws are fitted over a large radial range that extends well beyond @xmath12 . ''",

    "( 2007b ) refuted that their nuker break radii were biased `` in any way '' because their radii reportedly agreed very well with model - independent values of where the curvature in the surface brightness profile was a maximum .",
    "this was a surprising claim because these latter values should not be dependent on the radial extent of the data while the nuker model break radii _ are _ a strong function of the fitted radial extent ( graham et al .",

    "we are therefore modelling the largest sample of suspected ` core ' galaxies to date . for comparison s sake with the nuker model break radii ,",
    "we use exactly the same surface brightness profiles as lauer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , available at the previously mentioned nuker web - page .",
    "we first concentrate on measuring the core size using the core - srsic model ( see sections  [ sec_cs ] and [ sec_fit ] ) .",
    "we additionally take the nuclear excess , usually nuclear star clusters or agn emission , into account while modeling the underlying host galaxy light . in section  [ sec_rb ]",
    "we use two model - independent core size estimators and reveal that one of these can not be used while the other is consistent with our core - srsic break radii .",
    "furthermore , we confirm that the published nuker model break radii are typically 100% larger than the break in the surface brightness profile determined relative to the inward extrapolation of the outer srsic function ( trujillo et al .",
    "we additionally report that ` artificial ' break radii have been reported in what were alleged to be ` core ' galaxies but are actually srsic galaxies with no break in their srsic profile and which thus have no partially depleted core relative to their outer light profile ( section  [ sec_core ] ) . throughout this paper",
    "we use terms such as actual , ` true ' and ` real ' break radii and cores when referring to galaxies that have inner surface brightness profiles which break downward from ( i.e.  have lower flux than ) the inward extrapolation of the outer srsic model which describes their outer stellar distribution .    sets of structural parameter relations encompassing central as well as global properties are presented in section  [ sec_rel ] .",
    "in particular , equations involving the break radius and associated surface brightness , and the luminosity , are derived .",
    "we also investigate the ( core size)-(central black hole mass ) relation in section  [ sec_rb - bh ] .",

    "their sample lacks any characterizing selection criteria and comprises galaxies at distances of @xmath19 10100 mpc .",
    "while almost all of the ` core ' galaxies were imaged with the f555w filter ( similar to broadband _ v _ ) , two were not and we use their f606w data ( roughly broadband _ r _ ) instead .",

    "this sample selection enables a direct comparison with the ( published ) nuker model s estimation of the core size and related parameters , and to further achieve this direct comparison we have modelled the same published light profiles@xmath20 .",
