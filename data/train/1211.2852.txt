    "it is generally believed that for efficient nonthermal particle acceleration in various explosive cosmic events strong plasma turbulence play the essential role . for nonthermal particles to emerge from the pools of majority thermal particle populations , some selection mechanism(s )",

    "the most likely selection mechanism is due to resonance interaction which assures the efficient energy / momentum transfer from the turbulence to nonthermal particles . in this review",
    ", we will discuss the cyclotron ( and transit - time ) resonance interactions which would be viable in various space plasma environments .",
    "in usual space - plasma environments , the electromagnetic fields have the background components ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) and overlapping multi - wave components , ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) where @xmath4 are the mode i d numbers .",
    "the generalized ohm s law gives the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 as @xmath5 where we write the bulk velocity of the plasma as @xmath6 and neglect higher order terms caused by the spatial variations of @xmath1 and electron thermal pressure .",

    "[ eqn : eomev ] ) can be regarded as an oscillator equation of the eigen - frequency @xmath9 with the forcing term on the right hand side .",
    "when we integrate ( [ eqn : eomev ] ) , we evaluate @xmath2 and @xmath3 at the electron position @xmath11 which is affected by the existence of the waves .",
    "therefore the system of equations ( [ eqn : eomev ] ) and ( [ eqn : eomer ] ) have nonlinearity , from which mode coupling effects among the wave components can appear .",
    "however , if the amplitudes of waves are small enough , we can separately integrate ( [ eqn : eomev ] ) for each wave , @xmath12 and then superpose the results afterward ( the standard procedure in the quasi - linear treatment ) . from here",
    "we choose a single wave mode and drop the superfix @xmath13 . ) for the mode # , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are evaluated at the particle position @xmath11 , which is affected by @xmath2 and @xmath3 themselves .",

    "[ note : selfnonlinearity ] ]    for simplicity we consider electromagnetic waves in a cold uniform plasma consisting of electrons and ions ( protons ) of equal density @xmath14 .",
    "we define the frequency and wave number of the waves as @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "if not otherwise noted , the @xmath17 axis is taken along the background magnetic field @xmath1 , and the @xmath18 axis is so chosen that the wave vector @xmath16 is in the @xmath19 plane , @xmath20 .",
    "linear dispersion property is summarized in appendix a. we neglect the back reaction of electrons toward the electromagnetic field ( test - particle approach ) .",
    "the first case is for a parallel propagating whistler wave with @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and the relative wave amplitude @xmath23 .",
    "we inject @xmath24 electrons with the initial conditions of @xmath25 where ( @xmath26 are distributed uniformly in the two dimensional space , @xmath27 @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is fixed at @xmath30 .",

    "this is the most natural resonance , in which right - hand rotating electrons interact with right - hand polarized whistler waves .",
    "historically - famous kennel - petscheck theory ( @xcite ) for the loss - cone instability of whistler waves by the trapped electrons in the radiation belt mainly focused on this resonance .",
    "recently , @xcite applied this resonance condition to the electron injection process at shocks (  [ sec : amanohoshino ] ) .",
    "note that electrons in a monochromatic wave are ` trapped ' around @xmath40 and their pitch angle diffusion does not occur . in figure 1",
    "there is a dip at @xmath43 , which is the manifestation of the trapping effect ( appendix b ) . if , on the other hand , we superpose multi waves , the interaction between the electron and one particular wave component is limited within a finite coherent time @xmath44 , giving a contribution @xmath45 to the pitch - angle diffusion coefficient .",
    "the task of quasilinear theory from this point of view is to evaluate the coherent time @xmath44 for a given ensemble of wave components .",
    "since the literature on quasilinear theory is too vast , we should limit the reference to only a few articles ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] is for an oblique propagating whistler wave with @xmath21 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and the same relative wave amplitude @xmath23 as in  [ sec : parallelpropagatingwave ] .",
    "we inject @xmath49 electrons with the same initial condition as ( [ eqn : injection ] ) .",
    "peaks labeled with integer numbers ( @xmath50 ) correspond to the harmonic number @xmath51 in the resonance condition ( [ eqn : nrresonancecondtion ] ) .",
    "it is noted that there sometimes appear dips at the resonant velocities .",
    "again these dips are manifestation of the trapping effect already seen in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the resonance conditions for @xmath52 are illustrated in figure [ fig:3 ] .",
    "the highest peak with @xmath42 in figure [ fig:2 ] is for the fundamental cyclotron resonance condition , @xmath53 which is already discussed in  [ sec : parallelpropagatingwave ] for the purely parallel propagating case .",
    "the second highest peak in figure [ fig:2 ] is for the landau resonance or transit - time resonance condition , @xmath55 to see the origin of this resonance , we return to the @xmath17 component of the equation of motion ( [ eqn : eomevforsinglewave ] ) , @xmath56 where the second term in the parenthesis on the right hand side of ( [ eqn : eomevx ] ) is the @xmath57 term . from the numerical inspection of ( [ eqn : eomevx ] )",
    ", we find that the relative contribution of the @xmath58 term is less than 1% of the @xmath57 term .",
    "( the dependence of @xmath59 on @xmath60 is essentially unchanged , if @xmath58 is artificially set zero . )",
    "the @xmath61 term describes the mirror force exerted by the variation of the magnetic field magnitude , and this resonance is called ` transit - time ' resonance ( e.g. , @xcite ) .      the resonance corresponding to the peak with @xmath62 in figure [ fig:2 ] , @xmath63 is historically called ` anomalous cyclotron resonance ' ( or ` anomalous doppler effect ' : e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "( [ eqn : nrresonancecondtionanomalous ] ) is equivalent to @xmath64 which means that the wave is overtaken by the electron as @xmath65 exceeds the wave phase speed @xmath66 ( here we set @xmath67 ) .",
    "therefore , there is a reversal of the wave polarization from the background plasma frame to the electron comoving frame .",
    "the term ` anomalous ' stems from this reversal of polarization .",
    "it is noted that an oblique propagating whistler wave is elliptically polarized and consists of right - hand polarized ( r ) and left - hand polarized ( l ) subcomponents .",
    "when the resonance condition ( [ eqn : nrresonancecondtionanomalous ] ) applies , there are dual polarization reversals , namely r and l subcomponents in the background plasma frame respectively become left - hand and right - hand polarized in the electron comoving frame .",
    "what the electron efficiently exchanges energy and momentum at the @xmath62 condition is the l subcomponent in the background plasma frame resonance condition feels the whistler wave _",
    "left_-hand polarized in its own comoving frame and does not exchange energy and momentum with the wave efficiently . ] .",
    "@xcite utilized this resonance condition to excite oblique whistler waves by electron beams injected from the shock front .",
    "cyclotron higher - harmonic resonance phenomena for oblique and perpendicular propagating waves are well known ( see , e.g. , chapter 10 of @xcite ) .",
    "its application to bernstein wave observed in the jovian magnetosphere is one of the classical examples ( @xcite ) .      in figure",
    "[ fig:2 ] there are some minor structures at subharmonic numbers , @xmath69 where the dip structures ( trapping effects ) are seen to dominate over the small peak structures",
    ". these are manifestations of cyclotron sub - harmonic resonance interaction , which was first discussed by @xcite , and then followed by @xcite for perpendicular propagating magnetosonic waves .",
    "there are renewed interests on this particular resonance for oblique alfvn waves ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of this resonance is the self nonlinearity noted in the footnote@xmath70 of  [ sec : testparticleapproach ] .      as shown in figure 2",
    ", there are many possible resonance modes for oblique propagating waves .",
    "it is of interest to see how the relative importance of these mode depends on the propagation angle @xmath71 .",
    "figure 4 shows the dependence of @xmath59 on the propagation angle @xmath71 of whistler waves at three different resonance conditions ( @xmath52 ) . in the quasi - parallel propagation regime ( @xmath72 )",
    ", the fundamental resonance of @xmath42 dominates over others . on the other hand , in the quasi - perpendicular regime ( @xmath73 ) ,",
    "the transit - time resonance ( @xmath54 ) and the anomalous cyclotron resonance ( @xmath62 ) become progressively more important as @xmath74 , and exceed the fundamental resonance above @xmath75 .",
    "it has been known that the electron component of galactic cosmic rays is about 1% of the proton component ( e.g. , @xcite ) . while the origin of this percentage is not well understood , it is generally interpreted as the indication of smaller injection / acceleration efficiency for electrons than ions . for the case of ions , a part of their suprathermal component is reflected by shock fronts to form a beam .",
    "the beam ions then excite mhd waves through the ion - beam - cyclotron resonance condition and are subject to the pitch angle scattering process ( @xcite ) , which is the first step to the diffusive shock acceleration process for the ions .",
    "if we apply the same scenario to electrons , difficulty arises at the level of the wave excitation .",
    "figure [ fig : amanohoshino ] illustrate this difficulty ( @xcite ) : an oblique solid line running from the upper - left is the fundamental cyclotron resonance condition ( [ eqn : nrresonancecondtion1st ] ) for the electrons with the beam velocity , @xmath76 , @xmath77 the interaction point ` a ' between the beam electrons and the whistler wave is not available for the wave excitation since the beam electrons with purely parallel velocity _ absorb _ whistler wave energy at this point . the interaction point ` b ' is for the anomalous cyclotron resonance condition between the beam electrons and ion cyclotron wave ( left - hand polarized in the plasma rest frame ) .",
    "however , in the interplanetary and interstellar plasmas of typical temperature , there are a plenty of thermal ions which damp the ion cyclotron wave via fundamental cyclotron resonance interaction ( shaded region around ` b ' ) so that efficient pitch angle scattering of electrons is prohibited .    what @xcite proposed is to invoke the loss cone distribution of beam electrons , which is the natural consequence of the electron reflection process at the shock front ( shock drift acceleration process ) and can provide the free energy to the whistler wave excitation at the interaction point ` a ' if the damping effect by thermal electrons ( shaded region around the @xmath78 line , namely @xmath79 with the thermal velocity @xmath80 of background electrons ) is avoided .",
    "these considerations lead to the criterion for the shock alfvn mach number @xmath81 for the efficient electron acceleration , @xmath82 which agrees with the observational criterion for electron acceleration obtained at the earth s bow shock , where the hard spectral indices of suprathermal electrons ( @xmath83 ) are observed preferentially for high mach number bow shock satisfying @xmath84 ( figure [ fig : oka ] from @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite proposed a new type of surfing acceleration of ions resonating with a left - hand circularly polarized wave through the fundamental cyclotron resonance condition positive for the left - hand polarized waves . ] with @xmath85 , @xmath86 it is known that a particle trapped by a monochromatic circularly polarized wave oscillates around the resonant point in a phase space . during a trapped oscillation , a particle energy as well as a relative phase between the particle and the wave is bounded .",
    "however , if an external force is imposed to keep the relative phase constant , the particle can continue to gain energy from the wave electric field .",
    "such a forced resonance condition is realized , for instance , in the foreshock region of a quasi - parallel shock where an electrostatic potential acts as the external force .",
    "figure [ fig : kuramitsu ] shows completely resonant ( solid lines ) and near resonant ( dashed lines ) ion trajectories in @xmath87 ( a ) and @xmath88 ( b ) phase spaces in a given electrostatic potential whose spatial profile is represented with a dotted line in ( a ) .",
    "the two particles are accelerated monotonically in perpendicular direction while keeping the parallel velocities ( almost ) constant at @xmath89 . in their test particle simulation",
    "all the resonant particles are eventually accelerated regardless of their initial gyro phases due to the effect of phase synchronization which is shown in figure [ fig : kuramitsu ] ( c ) in which time evolution of @xmath90 of the resonant particles having a variety of initial gyro phases ( solid lines ) and @xmath91 component of the wave electric field ( dotted line ) are plotted .",
    "it has been known that heavy ions in the fast solar wind have faster flow velocity and hotter temperature ( especially in the direction perpendicular to @xmath1 ) than the proton population , the main population of the solar wind .",
    "@xcite have proposed a second - order fermi acceleration mechanism for the preferential perpendicular heating of heavy ions by counterstreaming left - hand circularly polarized waves . in figure",
    "[ fig : isenbergvasquez ] , the case for protons ( ( a ) and ( b ) ) is contrasted with that for heavy ions ( ( c ) and ( d ) ) : the second - order fermi process works rather slowly for protons .",
    "this is because the signs of the resonance velocities for parallel and anti - parallel propagating waves are different , and the acceleration of protons by these waves does not occur simultaneously . on the other hand , minor heavy ions",
    "whose cyclotron frequency @xmath92 is smaller than @xmath93 have multiple resonant interaction points if the condition @xmath94 is satisfied ( figure [ fig : isenbergvasquez ] ( c ) ) axis along @xmath1 .",
    "the limiting velocity @xmath95 for the multiple interactions corresponds to the condition tangential to the wave dispersion relation ( figure [ fig : isenbergvasquez](c ) ) . ] .",
    "therefore , heavy ions can be accelerated by multi waves simultaneously as indicated by the thick arrow in figure [ fig : isenbergvasquez](d ) .",
    "@xcite found a very efficient acceleration of relativistic particles in developing alfvn waves in an electron - positron pair plasma , where the wave number and frequency spectra of the waves are developing through parametric decay instabilities . figure [ fig : matsukiyohada ] ( a ) shows two examples of trajectories of electrons which are efficiently accelerated along the vertical line ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "the gray line denotes an accelerated electron in the course of the decay instability self - consistently reproduced in a one - dimensional full particle - in - cell simulation , while the black line is obtained from a test particle simulation in modeled electromagnetic fields .",
    "this acceleration is interpreted in the following scenario : in the developing turbulence , there exist waves propagating both directions parallel and anti - parallel to the background magnetic field .",
    "the fundamental cyclotron resonance condition ( @xmath42 ) for relativistic electrons is @xmath97 where @xmath40 satisfies @xmath98 with the four velocity @xmath99 @xmath100 , ( [ eqn : relaresonancecondtion ] ) is rewritten as ] ] , @xmath101 figure [ fig : matsukiyohada ] ( b ) shows the relation between @xmath102 and @xmath103 given by ( [ eqn : relaresonancecondtion2 ] ) , where the frequency @xmath104 and the parallel and anti - parallel wave numbers @xmath105 are chosen .",
    "it is remarkable that at @xmath106 the two resonance curves overlap so that an electron can interact with two counterstreaming waves at the same time and be efficiently accelerated .",
    "this scenario is similar to the one for heavy ions (  [ sec : solarwind ] ) except that the former is made possible by the relativistic reduction of the cyclotron frequency ( @xmath107 ) instead of the intrinsic difference in cyclotron frequencies for the latter ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "recently , it is suggested that relativistic electrons in the earth s radiation belt are coherently accelerated by large amplitude whistler waves satisfying the relativistic cyclotron resonance condition ( [ eqn : relaresonancecondtion ] ) ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "large amplitude whistler waves are actually observed as ` chorus ' emissions ( @xcite ) .",
    "the essence of the ` turning acceleration ' model ( @xcite ) is the relativistic reduction of the cyclotron frequency in ( [ eqn : relaresonancecondtion ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : omura ] shows two cases with @xmath109 ( with @xmath110 ) and @xmath111 ( with @xmath112 ) .",
    "an electron with @xmath113 and @xmath109 is assumed to start interacting with the ( counter - streaming ) chorus wave . since the chorus wave has a large amplitude ,",
    "the electron is trapped and accelerated to increase @xmath114 ( i.e. , reduce @xmath40 ) coming to the turning point with @xmath115 .",
    "after the turning point , the electron moves toward the same direction of the wave propagation , so that the wave - particle interaction to continue long enough to further accelerate the electron up to @xmath116 , where the electron is detrapped .",
    "we have given an overview on the importance of resonant wave - particle interaction processes in space plasmas .",
    "although each of elementary processes are well known one by one , there is a necessity to unify these processes .",
    "for example , as we see in  [ sec : obliquepropagatingwave ] to consider interaction process between particles and oblique propagating waves we need to take into account of all resonance interactions with harmonic numbers @xmath51=@xmath117 , and sometimes even with subharmonic numbers @xmath51=@xmath118 .    in  5.1 - 3",
    "we see the various roles of cyclotron resonant condition in the processes , shock injection , gyroresonant surfing , and ion heating in the solar wind .",
    "of course , the considerations for the elementary resonance processes alone do not suffice for comprehensive understandings of targeting physical processes : injected electrons at the shock front (  [ sec : amanohoshino ] ) or surfing - accelerated ions at the shock front (  [ sec : kuramitsukrasnoselskikh ] ) should be accelerated further in diffusive shock acceleration process , for example , to acquire relativistic energy . for the dynamics of heavy ions in the solar wind , the second - order fermi heating mechanism (  [ sec : solarwind ] )",
    "is incorporated into an inhomogeneous coronal hole model with the effects of gravity , charge - separation electric field , and mirroring force in the decreasing solar magnetic field ( @xcite ) .    in ",
    "[ sec : matsukiyohada ] and  [ sec : relativisticturningacceleration ] we further see that the relativistic resonance condition makes the interaction process very rich . note that these considerations are for the behavior of relativistic particles in _",
    "nonrelativistic _ turbulences .",
    "while there are a few pioneering studies in stochastic acceleration process in _ relativistic _ turbulences ( e.g. , @xcite ) , further works on relativistic turbulence are needed to get comprehensive understanding , for example , of the acceleration process of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    since we have limited the discussion to the waves in cold plasmas , wave modes raising from the finite temperature effect are outside of our scope . among these modes ,",
    "kinetic alfvn waves have been a focus of extensive investigation .",
    "here we refer the interested readers to a few representative papers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we would like to thank for valuable discussions and comments to t. hada , m. scholer , m. a. lee , and y. ohira .",
