    "the information contained in the `` phase image '' is essential in many applications such as magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) @xcite and interferometric synthetic aperture radar ( insar ) @xcite . in these techniques",
    "the phase is not observed directly but computed from a complex signal .",
    "therefore , the measured values are wrapped in the interval @xmath1 and the observed signal presents @xmath0 jumps .",
    "phase unwrapping is the procedure that allows us to practically remove these discontinuities to obtain the actual phase image .",
    "although , the modulo operation is quite trivial , its inversion can be very hard to solve .",
    "phase unwrapping techniques need to be able to overcome , among other problems , discontinuities , noise and under - sampling of the phase .    in one dimension ,",
    "the unwrapping process is straightforward since there is only one possible `` path '' and a simple integration can recover the actual phase .",
    "however , this only works when the itoh smoothness condition @xcite is satisfied , _ i.e. _ , when the absolute value of the phase gradient is lower or equal to @xmath2 .",
    "the presence of noise or discontinuities could violate this condition , causing some unwrapping errors .",
    "most existing methods extend this integration principle to two dimensions ( 2-d ) and are denominated path - following algorithms .",
    "the problem in 2-d is the error propagation when the smoothness condition is violated .",
    "this occurs because the integration results depend on the chosen integration path and on the start and end points .",
    "the challenge remains in distinguishing jumps due to phase wrapping from those due to noise and discontinuities in the actual function .",
    "several works have considered additional information such as pixel quality maps @xcite to appropriately update the integration path . however , such algorithms have some difficulties to deal with high levels of noise .",
    "in addition to these algorithms , several efforts have been made in the development of path - independent methods .",
    "state - of - the - art techniques rely on the global minimization of an energy function based on the classical @xmath3 norm of the error @xcite or on a generalized @xmath3 norm @xcite .",
    "when minimizing the classical @xmath3 norm of the error as in @xcite , the retrieved phase is generally smooth and sensitive to noise . in @xcite",
    "the authors prove that by minimizing a generalized @xmath3 norm using graph - cut techniques they are able to obtain an exact phase recovery ( in noiseless scenarios ) .",
    "the developed algorithm is denoted puma and is considered a state - of - the - art method in phase unwrapping without denoising .",
    "some works have included puma for unwrapping and they have added a denoising step either before @xcite or after @xcite the unwrapping step .",
    "both approaches have proved to outperform the classical @xmath3 norm minimization . while the approach of denoising before unwrapping @xcite deals better with high noise scenarios without discontinuities , it was reported that discontinuities are better preserved when the denoising is performed after the unwrapping @xcite .",
    "we aim at developing a general numerical reconstruction method that is able to simultaneously unwrap and denoise the observed phase .",
    "we propose a convex optimization approach based on the minimization of a sparsity prior on the phase image under a data fidelity constraint expressed in the phase derivative domain and adapted to gaussian distributed noise .",
    "moreover , to stabilize the algorithm , the first phase component is assumed to be zero .",
    "the problem is solved by means of the primal - dual algorithm proposed by chambolle and pock @xcite .",
    "the results are compared with the state - of - the - art technique puma , whose output is denoised in a post - processing step .",
    "although puma is faster and provides better results for the noiseless scenario , the proposed convex method provides better reconstruction quality for different noisy scenarios .",
    "our work is concerned by the reconstruction of a phase image @xmath4 discretized over @xmath5 pixels on a regular cartesian grid .",
    "the phase measurement process can be defined via the centralized modulo operator , or _ wrapping _ ,",
    "@xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 \\in [ -\\pi,\\pi ) $ ] represents the component - wise wrapping , @xmath9 is the observed wrapped phase and @xmath10 stands for an additive phase sensing noise .    because of the modulo operation , we know that the actual phase @xmath11 can be expressed as the sum of the observations @xmath12 with integer multiples of @xmath0 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath13 for some @xmath14 .    interestingly , if the itoh smoothness condition is satisfied and there is no noise in the measurement ( @xmath15 ) , the image gradient can be indirectly observed through the following relation @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the ( finite difference ) gradient operator .    in the presence of low levels of noise such that the noisy phase satisfies the smoothness condition ( @xmath18 ) , _ i.e.",
    "_ , when @xmath19 on every pixel @xmath20 , the relation in becomes : @xmath21 assuming an additive white gaussian noise model , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath22 , the itoh condition is satisfied on all pixels if @xmath23 since @xmath24 @xcite , we have @xmath25 and @xmath26 for some @xmath27 .",
    "this shows that the itoh condition is increasingly harder to satisfy mainly when @xmath28 increases .",
    "note that for any @xmath28 , the @xmath29 norm of @xmath30 can be bounded using the chernoff - hoeffding bound @xcite : @xmath31 which holds with high probability for @xmath32 .    when we encounter higher levels of noise and phase discontinuities , the relation in is no longer valid .",
    "the error between the indirect observations and the phase gradient occurs in the @xmath20 pixels where the itoh condition is not satisfied . since @xmath20 represents a small percentage of the total amount of pixels ( increasing with @xmath28 and with the discontinuities )",
    ", we can assume the error is sparse and it can be bounded using the @xmath33-norm : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the error bound . in this paper , we estimate this error by computing @xmath36 using the reconstruction @xmath37 obtained by the puma method @xcite .",
    "this algorithm is known for estimating @xmath38 without denoising .",
    "it is rather clear that the ensemble of images having the same wrapped observations @xmath12 forms a non - convex set : even when @xmath15 , if both @xmath39 and @xmath40 produce the same wrapped observation @xmath12 , there exist two integer vectors @xmath41 and @xmath42 such that @xmath43 and obviously @xmath44 does not satisfy such a relation for all @xmath45 $ ] since @xmath46 for most @xmath47 .",
    "in front of such a discrete formalism , several authors have proposed methods based on combinatorial optimization and graph - cut techniques @xcite .    in this paper , we follow a different approach .",
    "we propose to relax the problem and to solve it using convex optimization by leveraging the differential relation . despite the wrapping operation",
    ", we expect that holds for the phase signal @xmath11 given an appropriate value @xmath35 .    moreover , in order to circumvent the ill - conditioning of the problem in the presence of noise and `` non - itoh '' phase discontinuities , we also regularized our method by an appropriate wavelet analysis prior model based on the structure of the phase , _",
    "i.e. _ , a common tool used in many denoising methods @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we assume that the unwrapped phase image has a sparse or compressible representation in an orthonormal basis @xmath48 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the coefficients vector @xmath49 has few important values and its @xmath33-norm is expected to be small .",
    "the regularization process can then proceed by promoting a small @xmath33-norm in the wavelet projection of the phase image .",
    "the rationale of this is also to prevent fake phase jump reconstruction ( since these increase locally the wavelet coefficient values ) and to enforce the noise canceling .",
    "we also follow a common practice in the field which removes the ( unsparse ) scaling coefficients from the @xmath33-norm computation .",
    "since both the differential fidelity and the wavelet prior are blind to the addition of a global constant , there is an ambiguity to estimate the phase up to such addition . in order to avoid this incertitude and to stabilize the convex optimization",
    ", we arbitrarily enforce the first phase component to be zero .",
    "we should note that the initial problem is itself ill - posed since , even if we solve it using directly with a perfect data prior model , a `` good '' solution would be determined up to a global addition of a multiple of @xmath0 .",
    "this constraint also induces the uniqueness of the solution .",
    "finally , since the noise level is assumed to be known and the noise @xmath29-norm to be bounded , we also propose to explicitly recover the noise part in an additive model where the unknown phase and noise are summed up to faithfully satisfy  .",
    "gathering all these aspects , the proposed reconstruction program reads @xmath50    anticipating the scope of the next section , we may notice that by forming the vector @xmath51 , the convex minimization described above can be recast as@xmath52   + \\imath_{{\\mathcal}c_2}({\\boldsymbol}\\nabla\\,({{\\bf i } } , { { \\bf i}})\\,{\\boldsymbol}w ) + \\imath_{\\omega}({\\boldsymbol}w),\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 are the selection operators of the first and the last @xmath5 elements of a vector in @xmath54 , respectively ; @xmath55 is the identity matrix ; @xmath56 is the ( convex ) indicator function of a convex set @xmath57 , which equals to @xmath58 if @xmath59 and to @xmath60 otherwise ; and with the convex sets @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in the next section we present the algorithm to solve numerically .",
    "we are interested in finding the phase candidate that minimizes , a problem that contains the sum of four lower semicontinuous convex functions from @xmath64 to @xmath65 , _",
    "i.e. _ , they belong to the space @xmath66 for some dimension @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "in particular , we aim at solving the general optimization@xmath68 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 the number of convex functions . for this",
    ", we use the chambolle - pock primal - dual algorithm defined in a product space @xcite . as any other proximal algorithm @xcite ,",
    "this one relies on the definition of the proximal operator @xmath71 that is uniquely defined for any @xmath72 for some @xmath73 @xcite . by writing @xmath74 ,",
    "the cp iterations are @xmath75 with @xmath76 tending to a minimizer @xmath77 of with @xmath78 . to match the formulation with the problem at hand , we set @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 for @xmath82 ; @xmath83 for @xmath84 ; @xmath85 ; @xmath86 ; @xmath87 and @xmath88 .    in order to apply the algorithm in",
    ", we must compute the proximal operators of @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , the first three functions being the legendre - fenchel conjugate of their unstarred version .",
    "the proximal operator of @xmath93 is determined via the one of @xmath94 thanks to the conjugation property  @xcite:@xmath95 the proximal operator of @xmath96 is given by the soft thresholding operator  @xcite@xmath97}({\\boldsymbol}\\zeta ) = \\text{sign}({\\boldsymbol}\\zeta ) ( |{\\boldsymbol}\\zeta| - \\tfrac{1}{\\nu})_+.{\\vspace{-2mm}}\\ ] ]    the proximal operators of @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath92 are given by the projection onto the convex sets @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively : @xmath103}({\\boldsymbol}\\zeta - { \\boldsymbol}q),\\\\ \\operatorname{prox}_{\\mu",

    "i.e. _ , to ensure that @xmath108 converges to the solution of when @xmath109 increases , we need to set @xmath110 and @xmath111 such that @xmath112 @xcite . the induced norm of the operator ( @xmath113 ) is estimated using the standard power iteration algorithm @xcite .",
    "in this section , we validate our convex approach by studying the quality of the unwrapped phase with respect to the amount of `` wraps '' in the measurements , the noise level and the presence of non - itoh discontinuities in the original phase image .",
    "results are fairly compared with a post - denoised phase unwrapping obtained by the conjunction of the puma algorithm @xcite with an optimal soft thresholding denoising @xcite using the same wavelet basis as in .",
    "hereafter , the solutions of our convex approach and of the post - denoised puma are denoted as @xmath114 and @xmath115 , respectively .",
    "two kinds of discrete phase images are selected in our experiments .",
    "they are defined on a @xmath116 pixel grid ( @xmath117 ) . in the first image",
    "the phase is simulated by a 2-d gaussian function of height @xmath118 , and standard deviations of 40 pixels horizontally and 25 pixels vertically . in the second image ,",
    "the phase is simulated by a truncated version of the 2-d gaussian , where the image is masked by a side triangle . by truncating the gaussian image , we are able to simulate phase discontinuities .",
    "+    the robustness of our method is tested against three different noise levels , each characterized by a different `` input snr '' , @xmath119 , namely , 10 db , 25 db and @xmath120 db ( no noise ) .",
    "since there is no reliable estimation of the initial signal mean in any phase unwrapping method , all reconstruction qualities are measured with centralized reconstructions and ground truths , _",
    "i.e. _ , by mean subtraction .",
    "after such procedure , the quality of a given reconstruction @xmath121 is measured with the `` reconstruction snr '' : @xmath122 .    all algorithms were implemented in matlab and executed on a 3.2 ghz cpu , running a 64 bit linux system .    for the behavior of the algorithm with respect to the amount of `` wraps ''",

    "we noticed that for the noiseless scenario ( isnr = @xmath120 db ) , the reconstruction quality is not affected by the value of @xmath126 , since the itoh condition is always satisfied . however",

    "we can note that for the truncated gaussian the reconstruction quality decreases with rsnr = 16.7db , because the algorithm is not able to completely recover the phase due to the high discontinuity at the peak of the triangle .",
