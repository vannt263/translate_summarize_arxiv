    "a certain number of simplicial complexes and graphs have been very useful in the study of teichmller spaces , mapping class groups and hyperbolic @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "these include the curve , pants , and arc complexes and the related curve , pants and flip graphs .",
    "viewed as metric spaces , the large scale geometry of these spaces has been extensively investigated .",
    "they all have ( with the exception of some low complexity examples ) the mapping class group as set of simplicial automorphisms but their geometries are very different .",
    "we ll be interested in a topological property : the _ graph genus _ of the three graphs as well as the genus of their quotients by the mapping class group .",
    "the curve graph records the isotopy classes of curves on a fixed surface and their intersection properties .",
    "curve graphs have played a key role in the understanding of the geometry of teichmller space , hyperbolic @xmath0-manifolds and mapping class groups ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the geometry of the curve graph in particular has been studied in detail - it is a gromov hyperbolic metric space and quasi - isometric to an electrified version of teichmller space @xcite .",
    "more recently it was proved independently by aougab in @xcite , bowditch in @xcite , and clay , rafi and schleimer @xcite that the hyperbolicity constant is in fact uniform ( independent of the topology ) . in @xcite ,",
    "hensel , webb and przytycki prove that the constant is at most @xmath1 .",
    "the mapping class group of a surface acts naturally on the corresponding curve graph through its action on isotopy classes of curves .",
    "the quotient graph under the action of the mapping class group is what we will call the modular curve graph .",
    "it essentially follows from the classification of finite type surfaces that , at least for closed surfaces , this is a complete graph with additional loops attached to vertices . with this observation , the graph genus of the modular curve graph is equivalent to a well - known theorem of ringel and youngs @xcite about the genus of the complete graph . in some sense",
    "this is one of our starting points ; for the other two graphs we consider the question does not boil down to a well known theorem .",
    "pants graphs have pants decompositions as vertices and have edges between vertices if the two corresponding pants decompositions can be related by a so - called elementary move .",
    "although related to the curve graph , the pants graph has a very different geometry and is only gromov hyperbolic in a few low complexity cases , as proved by brock and farb in @xcite .",
    "brock also proved that it is quasi - isometric to teichmller space with the weil - petersson metric .",
    "the mapping class group acts on the pants graph as well and the quotient of this action , the modular pants graph , has a purely graph theoretic interpretation .",
    "vertices are homeomorphism types of pants decompositions and so can be encoded by isomorphism types of trivalent graphs .",
    "elementary moves on pants decompositions then correspond to natural transformation of these graphs ( sometimes called @xmath2-moves or whitehead moves ) .",
    "the final type of graphs that we consider is formed by the flip graphs .",
    "these are graphs of triangulations of punctured surfaces , which share an edge if they are related by a so called flip ( or equivalently if they differ by a single arc ) .",
    "these graphs are related to a number of different topics including cell decompositions of _ decorated _ teichmller space ( see for example @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "again , the mapping class group is generally the full automorphism group of the graph , a result of korkmaz and papadopoulos @xcite recently extended to injective maps between different flip graphs by aramayona , the first author and koberda in @xcite . in the particular case where the surface is a polygon with @xmath3 sides ,",
    "the geometry of these flip graphs was investigated by sleator , tarjan and thurston in @xcite .",
    "they proved that the diameter of these graphs was @xmath4 for large enough @xmath3 ( this was recently found to be true for @xmath5 by pournin @xcite ) .",
    "in general these graphs are nt finite though . however , the quotient of this graph by the mapping class group - the modular flip graph - is finite and every vertex in the flip graph has finite degree .",
    "the varc - milnor lemma then implies that the flip graph is a coarse model for studying the geometry of the mapping class group .",
    "when describing these three graphs , a first example is often the torus with a marked point or puncture .",
    "the pants graph and the curve graph coincide in this case and are isomorphic to a farey graph . via the relationship between curves and arcs on a once punctured torus",
    ", it is not too difficult to see that the corresponding flip graph is the dual graph to the farey graph ( with its usual disk embedding ) .",
    "this dual graph is an infinite trivalent tree .",
    "so in all three cases , the graphs are planar .",
    "our first observation is that in general these graphs are far from being planar .    except for in a limited number of exceptional cases , the curve graph ,",
    "the pants graph and the flip graph all have infinite genus .",
    "we treat the graphs separately so the above theorem is a combination of theorems [ thm_cg ] , [ thm_pg ] and [ thm_fg ] .",
    "once we quotient the graphs by their automorphisms , the resulting graphs are finite so they have finite genus .",
    "let @xmath6 be a closed genus @xmath7 surface and @xmath8 be a surface of genus @xmath7 with a single marked point . as mentioned above ,",
    "the theorem of ringel and youngs about the genus of complete graphs and some simple observations about topological types of curves imply that implies that the genus of the modular curve graph is exactly @xmath9 we re able to identify how the genus grows in function of the topology of the underlying surface for the other two graphs .",
    "the genus of the modular pants graph of @xmath6 grows like @xmath10 for @xmath11 .",
    "the genus of the modular flip graph of @xmath8 grows like @xmath12 for @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , what we prove is precise estimates on the growth rates with explicit constants .",
    "the more precise statements are those of theorems [ thm_mp ] and [ thm_mf ] .",
    "the upper bounds are obtained using standard techniques to bound the genus of a graph .",
    "the lower bounds are much more difficult and we use probabilistic arguments in both cases .",
    "to do so , we need to adapt results about the probability that a random graph has an automorphism . as a by - product of what we need to prove",
    ", we end up counting the number of isomorphism classes of cubic multigraphs ( by multigraph we mean a graph where one is allowed multiple edges between vertices and loops ) .",
    "since the first version of the paper was released , we found a result of wormald that can be used to do this count .",
    "however , our proof is different so we think it might be of independent interest .",
    "@xcite let @xmath13 denote the number of isomorphism classes of cubic multigraphs on @xmath14 vertices .",
    "then : @xmath15 for @xmath16 .",
    "wormald actually stated this theorem for general @xmath17-regular multigraphs and also the techniques in our proof generalize to higher bounded degree , but because we need the result only in the case of degree @xmath0 , we restrict to this case .    the article is organized as follows .",
    "we begin with a preliminary section where we recall definitions and basic results about the genus of a graph and the three graphs we ll be interested in .",
    "we then have a section about random graphs where we recall some of the tools we need and where we prove others including theorem c above . in section 4",
    "we discuss random triangulations ; in particular we explain and adapt previous results of the second author and other known results .",
    "the subsequent sections are dedicated , in order , to our results concerning the curve graph , the pants graph and the flip graph .",
    "in this section we describe the three types of graphs we consider and recall the definition of the genus of a graph .",
    "we begin with the graph genus .",
    "the genus of a graph is a measure of its topological complexity and is defined as follows :    let @xmath18 be a graph .",
    "the genus of @xmath18 is given by : @xmath19 where the minimum of the empty set is @xmath20 .",
    "the main tool we will use to get bounds on the genera of graphs is the following proposition .",
    "the lower bound is due to beineke and harary and the upper bound is a well known fact that essentially bounds the genus of a graph in terms of its betti number ( or cycle rank ) :    @xcite[prp_general ] let @xmath18 be a connected graph with @xmath21 vertices , @xmath22 edges and girth @xmath23 then : @xmath24    the proof of the lower bound uses a classical theorem by youngs ( theorem 4.3 in @xcite ) which says that every minimal genus embedding @xmath25 is such that @xmath26 is disjoint union of open @xmath27-cells .",
    "the upper bound follows from constructing an explicit embedding .",
    "furthermore , both bounds are sharp .",
    "the sharpness of the lower bound can for instance be seen from the @xmath3-cube skeleton ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) and that of the upper bound can be seen from the set of trees .",
    "the main consequence of proposition [ prp_general ] that we are interested in is that if we have a sequence of graphs @xmath28 such that : @xmath29 and @xmath30 for all @xmath31 then : @xmath32 in other words , just by knowing the number of edges and vertices , we can determine the asymptotic behaviour of the genus of our sequence up to a multiplicative constant .      in what follows @xmath33",
    "will denote an orientable topological surface of genus @xmath7 with @xmath3 punctures .",
    "we set @xmath34 .",
    "a pants decomposition @xmath35 of @xmath33 is a set of isotopy classes of curves on @xmath33 such that @xmath36 is a disjoint union of three - holed spheres ( pairs of pants ) .",
    "the complexity @xmath37 of @xmath33 is the number of curves in a pants decomposition of @xmath33 .",
    "depending on @xmath7 and @xmath3 there may not be any pants decompositions so we will suppose that @xmath38 when @xmath39 we can define the curve graph of @xmath33 as follows :    the curve graph @xmath40 is the graph with :    * isotopy classes of simple closed curves on @xmath33 . * vertices @xmath41 and @xmath42 share an edge if and only if they can be realized disjointly on @xmath33 .",
    "( when @xmath43 the curve graph is defined analogously to the pants graph which we define in the sequel . )",
    "we will also be interested in the modular versions of the above graphs .",
    "these are the graphs where only the homeomorphism type of the of the objects matter . specifically :    the modular curve graph @xmath44 is the graph with :    * homeomorphism types of simple closed curves on @xmath33 . * vertices",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath42 share an edge if and only if they can be realized disjointly on @xmath33 .    one can obtain @xmath44 as a quotient of @xmath40 by the action of the ( extended ) mapping class group @xmath45 defined as follows : @xmath46 in particular we note that we are allowing orientation reversing homeomorphisms and homeomorphisms that permute punctures .",
    "except for in a few low complexity cases , the automorphism group of the curve graph is exactly the ( extended ) mapping class group so this amounts to looking at the curve graph up to simplicial automorphism .    for @xmath6 ,",
    "the graph @xmath47 is particularly simple .",
    "there are exactly @xmath48 homeomorphism types of simple closed curves on a closed surface of genus @xmath7 : there is one non - separating type and @xmath49 separating types depending on how much genus they leave on either side ( see figure [ fig : curvetypes ] for examples in genus @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) .     and @xmath51,width=453 ]",
    "it is not difficult to see that they can be realized disjointly so @xmath47 contains a complete graph on @xmath52 vertices .",
    "in addition there are loops at vertices corresponding to curves that can be realized by two different disjoint isotopy class of curve simultaneously . for odd @xmath7",
    "this is every curve and for even genus this is every curve except for the separating curve that separates the surface into two parts of genus @xmath53 .",
    "so the modular curve graph is quite simple and computing its genus is paramount to ringel and youngs computation of the genus of a complete graph .      on a @xmath33 with @xmath54 ,",
    "the pants graph @xmath55 is a graph on isotopy classes of pants decompositions of @xmath33 .",
    "an _ elementary move _ on an ( internal ) curve in a pants decomposition is one of the following :    * if the curve is a boundary curve of two distinct pairs of pants then an elementary move on this curve consists of replacing it with a curve that intersects it twice . *",
    "if the curve is a boundary curve of one pair of pants then an elementary move means replacing it with a curve that intersects it once .",
    "the figures below illustrate the types of elementary move .",
    "elementary moves 1 and 2 correspond to the first type and elementary move 3 to the second type .",
    "if we start with a pants decomposition and perform an elementary move on one of its curves , the resulting set of curves will again be a pants decomposition of the surface . elementary moves will allow us to define edges in the pants graph which we formally define as follows .",
    "the pants graph @xmath55 is the graph with :    * pants decompositions of @xmath33 .",
    "* vertices @xmath35 and @xmath56 share an edge if @xmath56 can be obtained from @xmath35 by performing an elementary move on one of its curves .    as before ,",
    "we define the modular pants graph as the graph defined on these objects up to homeomorphism .",
    "the moduli pants graph @xmath57 is the graph with :    * homeomorphism types of pants decompositions of @xmath33 . * vertices @xmath35 and @xmath56 share an edge if and only if @xmath56 can be obtained from @xmath35 by performing an elementary move on one of its curves .",
    "we again have an action of @xmath58 through the action on curves and @xmath59 as before , except for some complexity cases , the mapping class group is the automorphism group of the pants graph @xcite .",
    "the final type of graphs we will be interested in is flip graphs .",
    "these are graphs of ( isotopy classes ) of triangulations of @xmath33 with vertices that lie in the punctures ( and thus we suppose @xmath60 ) .",
    "more precisely , by a triangulation we mean a maximal collection of isotopy classes of arcs , disjoint in their interior .",
    "these maximal multi - arcs cut the surface into triangles , but are not necessarily proper triangulations as for instance a triangle may be glued to itself .",
    "( we refer to arcs of the triangulation as opposed to edges as to distinguish them from the edges of the flip graph itself . )",
    "given such a triangulation , a flip in one of the arcs of the triangulation consists of replacing this edge with its ` opposite diagonal ' .",
    "phrased otherwise , a flip is the removal of an arc and its replacement with the only other possible arc that can complete the resulting multi - arc into a triangulation .",
    "note that if an arc only belongs to one triangle , it is impossible to flip it .",
    "a flip is illustrated in figure [ pic8 ] .",
    "we can now define the flip graph :    let @xmath60 .",
    "the flip graph @xmath61 is the graph with :    * isotopy types of triangulations of @xmath33 with vertices in the punctures . *",
    "vertices @xmath62 and @xmath63 share an edge if and only if @xmath63 can be obtained from @xmath62 by performing a flip on one of the arcs of @xmath62 .    the modular version of the flip graph is defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath60.the modular flip graph @xmath64 is the graph with :    * homeomorphism types of triangulations of @xmath33 . * vertices @xmath62 and @xmath63 share an edge if and only if @xmath63 can be obtained from @xmath62 by performing a flip on one of the edges of @xmath62 .",
    "again , it is the quotient of the flip graph by the mapping class group or , except for in some low complexity cases , the quotient of the flip graph by its automorphisms @xcite .",
    "both pants decompositions and triangulations can be described using cubic ( or trivalent ) graphs .",
    "this means that we can use results from the theory of random regular graphs to count certain ` problematic ' pants decompositions and triangulations . in this section",
    "we will recall the results we will use from this theory , we will restrict to the cubic case .",
    "we begin with the definition of the set of random cubic graphs :    let @xmath65 then we define the set : @xmath66    an element @xmath67 corresponds to a cubic graph @xmath68 with vertex set @xmath69 in the following way : for every element in @xmath70 we create a half edge with label @xmath17 .",
    "we group these half edges in the sets @xmath71 , @xmath72 , ... , @xmath73 corresponding to vertices @xmath74 , @xmath27, ... ,@xmath14 . gluing these half edges into edges according to @xmath75 gives @xmath68 .    to turn @xmath76 into a probability space",
    "we define a probability measure : @xmath77 by : @xmath78 } = \\frac{{\\#\\left ( a \\right)}}{{\\#\\left ( \\omega_n \\right ) } } \\text { for all } a\\subset\\omega_n\\ ] ] where @xmath79 denotes the power set of @xmath76 .",
    "the first result we will need does not directly sound like a result on random graphs , but it follows from counting the number of labelled cubic graphs , which was done by bender and canfield in @xcite and then considering the probability that such a graph carries a non - trivial automorphism , which was done independently by bollobs in @xcite and mckay and wormald in @xcite . a simple graph is a graph without loops and without multiple edges .",
    "[ thm_bc ] @xcite , @xcite , @xcite let @xmath80 denote the number of isomorphism classes of simple cubic graphs on @xmath14 vertices . then",
    ": @xmath81 for @xmath16 .",
    "we will also use the result on automorphisms , so we state it separately .",
    "@xmath82 will denote the automorphism group of the graph @xmath18 .",
    "[ thm_aut ] @xcite , @xcite we have : @xmath83 } \\ ; = \\ ; 0\\ ] ]    we will also need to control is the distribution of the number of circuits of @xmath17 edges ( or @xmath17-circuits , where by a circuit we mean a cycle that traverses every edge at most once ) .",
    "note that a @xmath74-circuit is a loop and a @xmath27-circuit is a multiple edge .",
    "we begin by defining the corresponding set of random variables .",
    "we let : @xmath84 denote the random variable that counts the number of @xmath17-circuits for all @xmath85 .",
    "we will use the following theorem by bollobs :    [ thm_bol]@xcite let @xmath86 . then : @xmath87 where :    * @xmath88 is a poisson distributed random variable with mean @xmath89 . * the random variables @xmath90 are mutually independent .    in the proof of the theorem above one",
    "uses the fact that fixed graphs that are not circuits appear with probability tending to @xmath91 .",
    "we will need this fact and state it as a theorem :    [ thm_noncyc]@xcite let @xmath92 be a graph that contains more edges than vertices . then : @xmath93 } = \\mathcal{o}\\left(n^{-1}\\right)\\ ] ] for @xmath16 .",
    "finally , most graphs we will consider will actually be multigraphs , which means that we need to know the cardinality of the set of multigraphs with a fixed number of vertices as well .",
    "we have the following theorem , of which we offer a new proof below :    @xcite[thm_multigraphs1 ] let @xmath13 denote the number of isomorphism classes of cubic multigraphs on @xmath14 vertices .",
    "then : @xmath15 for @xmath16 .    to prove this , we define the following two sets : @xmath94 @xmath95 we have @xmath96 .",
    "we will use the two natural forgetful maps : @xmath97 if @xmath98 and @xmath99 have @xmath17 @xmath74-circuits and @xmath100 @xmath27-circuits , then we have : @xmath101    we know @xmath102 .",
    "we will first count @xmath103 using @xmath104 and after that we will use @xmath105 to count @xmath13 .    because @xmath106 and @xmath107 for all @xmath67 we have : @xmath108 } \\\\   & = \\frac{{\\#\\left ( \\omega_n \\right)}}{6^n}{\\mathbb{e}_{n}\\left[2^{x_1+x_2}\\right ] } \\\\   & = \\frac{{\\#\\left ( \\omega_n \\right)}}{6^n}{\\mathbb{e}_{n}\\left[\\sum_{k=0}^{x_1+x_2}\\binom{x_1+x_2}{k}\\right ] } \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because @xmath109 we have that : @xmath110 so we obtain : @xmath111 } \\\\   & = \\frac{{\\#\\left ( \\omega_n \\right)}}{6^n}\\sum_{k=0}^{2n}\\frac{1}{k!}{\\mathbb{e}_{n}\\left[\\left(x_1+x_2\\right)_k\\right ] } \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath112 .",
    "this number of equal to the number of ordered @xmath17-tuples of @xmath74- and @xmath27-circuits .",

    "using dominated convergence , we obtain : @xmath124 for @xmath125 .",

    "hence by the dominated convergence theorem we can take the limits of the terms to compute the limit of the sum .",
    "we have : @xmath130 } \\ ; \\leq \\;\\lim\\limits_{n\\rightarrow\\infty } { \\mathbb{p}_{n}\\left[\\mathrm{aut}\\neq \\{e\\}\\right ] } \\;= \\ ; 0\\ ] ] by theorem [ thm_aut ] .",
    "so we obtain that : @xmath131 and : @xmath132 for @xmath16 . combining the above and applying stirling s approximation",
    "now gives the theorem .",
    "we will also need to control the number of graphs that carry a map which distorts the adjacency structure at at most a fixed number of edges .",
    "this is a slight generalization of an automorphism of a graph . in theorem [ thm_aut ]",
    "we have already seen that the probability that a random cubic graph carries a non - trivial automorphism tends to @xmath91 for @xmath133 ( cf . also @xcite , @xcite ) . in particular , in @xcite , kim , sudakov and vu also consider maps of small distortion , but for regular graphs with growing vertex degrees .",
    "we note that the set of bijections of the vertex set @xmath134 of a graph can be identified with the symmetric group @xmath135 .",

    "the edge defect of @xmath138 on @xmath18 is the number : @xmath139    note the difference with the similar definition of the defect of a permutation by kim , sudakov and vu in @xcite .    we will also need to consider the action of an element @xmath140 on the edges @xmath141 , the complete graph on @xmath3 vertices . from hereon",
    "an edge orbit of an element @xmath140 will mean the orbit of an edge in @xmath141 under @xmath138 .",

    "the key ingredient is the following lemma ( equations 2.3 and 2.7 in @xcite ) :    [ lem_wor ] @xcite there exists a constant @xmath127 such that : given @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 for @xmath146 such that @xmath147 and @xmath148 such that @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",

    "all but @xmath17 images of the edges of @xmath92 ( seen as a subgraph of @xmath181 ) under @xmath138 should be edges in @xmath18 again .",
    "this means that @xmath92 can be written as a union of edge orbits of @xmath138 out of which @xmath17 edges have been removed and replaced by different edges .",
    "we are not interested in these replacement edges and consider the graph @xmath182 that consists of @xmath92 minus these edges .",
    "we define : @xmath183 what we have shown is that for @xmath171 : @xmath184    we now want to apply lemma [ lem_wor ] .",
    "this means that we need relate the cardinalities of @xmath185 and @xmath186 and the probabilities @xmath187}$ ] and @xmath188}$ ] , where @xmath182 is the graph obtained from @xmath189 by removing two edges .",
    "because a graph in @xmath185 has at most @xmath190 edges we get : @xmath191 and because @xmath182 contains @xmath17 edges fewer than @xmath92 , we have : @xmath192 } \\leq c'n^k \\cdot { \\mathbb{p}_{n}\\left[h\\subset\\gamma\\right]}\\ ] ] where @xmath193 is independent of @xmath92,@xmath182 and @xmath14 .",
    "it turns out that the bounds above in combination with lemma [ lem_wor ] are only small enough when the support of @xmath138 is large enough , i.e. when it contains at least @xmath194 elements .",
    "this means that we need to cut the sum over subgraphs into two pieces .",
    "recall that @xmath165 denotes the number of elements in the support @xmath166 of @xmath171 and define : @xmath195}\\ ] ] @xmath196}\\ ] ] so now we need to prove that both @xmath197 and @xmath198 tend to @xmath91 for @xmath16 .",
    "we start with @xmath198 .",
    "we have : @xmath199 } \\\\   & \\leq   \\sum\\limits_{\\substack{a , s_1,\\ldots , s_6 \\\\ e_1,f } }   c''\\cdot a^2 n^k \\sum_{(\\pi , h)\\in \\mathcal{h}_n(a , s_1,\\ldots , s_6,e_1,f)}{\\mathbb{p}_{n}\\left[h\\subset\\gamma\\right ] } \\\\   & \\leq   \\sum\\limits_{a=2k+1}^n   ( c''')^a n^{-a/2+k}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for constants @xmath200 independent of @xmath201 and @xmath14 ( we used lemma [ lem_wor ] and the fact that the number of choices for the variables other than @xmath201 is polynomial in @xmath201 in the last step ) .",
    "the final expression tends to @xmath91 for @xmath16 .    to prove that @xmath197 also tends to @xmath91",
    "we will need to use the assumptions on short circuits and the support of the supposed almost - automorphisms . recall that we are summing over all permutations @xmath171 with @xmath202 .",
    "we first note that the set of isomorphism classes of graphs we are summing over is finite ( they are graphs of bounded degree on at most @xmath203 vertices ) . because none of these are circuits by assumption , theorem [ thm_noncyc ] tells us that if they are not subtrees , they have asymptotic probability @xmath91 of appearing in the graph .",
    "as such the only subgraphs we need to worry about are small subtrees . because we assume that the support of @xmath138 contains at least @xmath204 vertices , this means that we need to consider subtrees of at least @xmath204 vertices .",
    "a counting argument shows that such a tree needs to be connected to the rest of the graph by at least @xmath205 edges .",
    "this leaves two options .",
    "either @xmath138 could have edge defect @xmath205 , in which case we are done , or at least two of these edges connect to the same vertex , in which case our graph needs to contain a subgraph that is either a short circuit or a more complicated graph and then we can apply the same reasoning as above .",
    "random cubic graphs also naturally come with an orientation : a cyclic ordering at each vertex of the half edges emanating from this vertex .",
    "we simply declare the cyclic order to be the same as the cyclic order of the labels on the half edges .",
    "such an orientation gives rise to a triangulated surface .",
    "we glue a triangle over every vertex of the graph and glue the sides of triangles together according to the edges of the graph , which we do in such a way that the orientation at every vertex corresponds to an outward orientation on the triangle via the right hand rule .",
    "this means that a random cubic graph gives rise to a notion of a random surface , which we will denote by @xmath206 for @xmath67 .",
    "these random surfaces were for example investigated in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in particular , in @xcite , the second author developed techniques for restricting to surfaces of a fixed topology .",
    "we will use these results to study the genus of the flip graph of @xmath8 .",
    "it follows from an euler characteristic argument that in this case the number of vertices of the corresponding graph will need to be @xmath207 .",
    "again , we start with a cardinality result ( theorem b of @xcite ) :    [ thm_cardfg1]@xcite we have : @xmath208 for @xmath16 .",
    "it follows from theorem b in @xcite that :    [ prp_circ ] let @xmath86 .",
    "there exists a set of mutually independent random variables @xmath209 for @xmath210 such that when we restrict to surfaces with @xmath74 puncture : @xmath211 where the limit has to be taken over @xmath212 .",
    "this follows from the fact that the random variables are sums of a finite number of converging random variables .",
    "it also follows from the results of @xcite ( lemma 6.3 there ) that if a labelled oriented graph @xmath92 contains no left hand turn cycle ( a cycle of the graph that turns in the direction dictated by the cyclic order at every vertex ) then we still have : @xmath213 } \\leq c n^{-{\\#\\left ( e(h ) \\right)}}\\ ] ] where @xmath127 does not depend on @xmath92 or @xmath14 .",
    "this means that all the arguments in the proof of proposition [ prp_symm1 ] still work in the case where we restrict to surfaces with @xmath74 puncture .",
    "so we obtain :    [ prp_symm2 ] let @xmath168 .",
    "there exists a @xmath127 such that the probability : @xmath214 } \\rightarrow 0\\ ] ] as @xmath16 .    in particular",
    ", the analogous theorem to theorem [ thm_aut ] also holds in this setting : asymptotically almost surely @xmath74-vertex triangulations have no automorphisms .",
    "this means that we also have the following :    [ thm_cardfg2]@xcite .",
    "let @xmath215 denote the number of isomorphism classes of triangulations of @xmath8 .",
    "we have : @xmath216 for @xmath11 .",
    "we can run the same proof as for theorem [ thm_multigraphs1 ] .",
    "the difference however is that we do not need to worry about @xmath74- or @xmath27-circuits : there will not be any @xmath74-circuits and because of the orientation @xmath27-circuits no longer add a factor @xmath27 .",
    "furthermore , asymptotically there are no automorphisms .",
    "so we get : @xmath217 filling in theorem [ thm_cardfg1 ] and using stirling s approximation gives the result .",
    "for the curve graphs we will not need the random graph approach .",
    "instead we rely on two classical theorems by ringel and ringel - youngs .",
    "the first one is about the bipartite complete graph @xmath218 .",
    "this is the graph with vertices @xmath219 and edges @xmath220 for all @xmath221 , @xmath222 .",
    "@xcite let @xmath223 .",
    "we have : @xmath224    using this we can compute the genus of the curve graph .    [ thm_cg ] let @xmath225 .",
    "we have : @xmath226    we need to prove that there exists no finite genus surface @xmath227 .",
    "we will do this by embedding @xmath228 into @xmath229 for arbitrarily large @xmath230 .",
    "we consider curves @xmath231 , @xmath232 , @xmath233 and @xmath234 on @xmath33 such that : @xmath235 curves with the properties of @xmath231 , @xmath232 , @xmath233 and @xmath234 exist because of the assumption on the genus . now",
    "let @xmath236 denote the dehn twist around @xmath237 for @xmath238 .",
    "then the vertices : @xmath239 induce a @xmath228 .",
    "we have already noted that the modular curve graph of a closed surface is a complete graph with loops added to all or all but one of the vertices .",
    "these loops do no change the genus of a graph , so we can ignore them . the genus of the complete graph is known through a classical theorem of ringel and youngs :    @xcite let @xmath31 .",
    "we have : @xmath240    in the case of the modular curve graph we need to compute its number of vertices .",
    "this is given by the number of homeomorphism types of curves on @xmath227 which is equal to @xmath241 thus as a corollary to the ringel - youngs theorem , we obtain an exact formula for the genus of the modular curve graph .",
    "[ cor_mc ] let @xmath242 .",
    "then : @xmath243",
    "for the pants graph we have :    [ thm_pg ] let @xmath225 , then : @xmath244    we will prove this by constructing a subgaph @xmath245 with @xmath246 for arbitrarily large @xmath230 .",
    "we consider a pants decomposition @xmath35 of @xmath6 that contains two curves that cut off distinct one holed tori .",
    "so @xmath35 has two curves , which we denote @xmath231 and @xmath233 , that are found inside these one holed tori ( the curves look like those in figure [ pic4 ] ) .",
    "we choose two curves @xmath232 and @xmath234 that also lie entirely in the one holed tori and that satisfy@xmath247 let @xmath86 .",
    "we look at the set of pairs of curves : @xmath248 each pair @xmath249 in this set corresponds to a pants decomposition @xmath250 by replacing @xmath231 in @xmath35 with @xmath251 and @xmath233 in @xmath35 with @xmath252 .",
    "we will identify this set of pairs of curves with the corresponding set of pants decompositions and consider the subgraph @xmath245 it induces .",
    "we have : @xmath253 furthermore : @xmath254 and @xmath255 this means that : @xmath256 finally , we have @xmath257 .",
    "proposition [ prp_general ] now gives the desired result .    to compute the genus of the modular pants graph",
    ", we will use the random graph tools from the previous two sections .",
    "the reason we can use these results is that pants decompositions of @xmath6 are in one to one correspondence with cubic graphs on @xmath258 vertices .",
    "the correspondence is given by the dual graph to a pants decomposition .",
    "this is the graph with the pairs of pants as vertices and an edge between every pair of pairs of pants per curve they share .",
    "note that this dual graph can in fact be a multigraph ; it can contain loops corresponding to pairs of pants like the one in figure [ pic4 ] and it can contain a @xmath27-cycle when two distinct pairs of pants share two curves .",
    "so , the vertices of @xmath259 can be seen as homeomorphism types of cubic multigraphs . when counting the edges of @xmath259 , we only need to consider elementary moves that make a difference on the graph level . on the graph level the elementary moves in figures [ pic2 ] , [ pic3 ] and [ pic4 ]",
    "look as follows :    , @xmath260,@xmath119 and @xmath261 represent pants curves . ]    , @xmath260,@xmath119 and @xmath261 represent pants curves . ]",
    "represents a pants curve . ]    the labels in figures [ pic6 ] and [ pic7 ] are meant to indicate the difference between the two corresponding moves .",
    "also note that move 3 does not do anything to the homeomorphism type of the pants decomposition .",
    "this means that the corresponding edge in @xmath262 projects to a loop in @xmath259 .    before we state out theorem , we define the following notation .",
    "let @xmath263 and @xmath264 .",
    "if @xmath265 we write @xmath266    we can now state our theorem .",
    "[ thm_mp ] we have : @xmath267 for @xmath11 , where @xmath268 and @xmath269 .",
    "we start with the upper bound . in every pants decomposition @xmath35 there are @xmath270 curves on which we can at most perform @xmath27 elementary moves that make a difference and are distinct on the graph level ( those of figures [ pic5 ] and [ pic6 ] ) .",
    "this means that in @xmath259 : @xmath271 the upper bound now follows directly by applying theorem [ thm_multigraphs1 ] and proposition [ prp_general ] .",
    "the lower bound is more difficult to obtain .",
    "what we need is a lower bound on the number of edges emanating from a ` generic ' pants decomposition in @xmath259 .",
    "more precicely , given @xmath86 we want to understand the ratio : @xmath272    to do this we will use the results from random cubic graphs from section [ sec_randgr ] .",
    "we define the following two sets : @xmath273 @xmath274 @xmath275 can be identified with the vertex set of @xmath259 and we have two forgetful maps : @xmath276 furthermore , if @xmath277 and @xmath278 have @xmath17 @xmath74-circuits and @xmath100 @xmath27-circuits , then we have : @xmath279 we want to relate probabilities in @xmath280 to probabilities in @xmath275 . from the two equations above we see that @xmath74-circuits , @xmath27-circuits and automorphisms cause trouble when relating these probabilities . to avoid this , we will consider only graphs in @xmath275 that do nt have any such circuits .",
    "we define : @xmath281    if @xmath282 then : @xmath283}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    so what remains is to translate the statement ` @xmath284 ' into the language of graphs .",
    "more precisely , we need to find a necessary condition for a vertex in @xmath259 to have less than @xmath285 edges and this condition needs to be phrased in terms of the graph dual to the pants decomposition of that vertex .",
    "there are essentially two ways in which a pants decomposition @xmath35 can ` lose ' an outgoing edge :    * @xmath35 shares an edge with a pants decomposition @xmath56 that is isomorphic to @xmath35 .",
    "* @xmath35 shares edges with two pants decompositions @xmath286 and @xmath287 that are isomorphic to each other .",
    "we start with situation ( i ) .",
    "the first possibility in this case is that @xmath35 contains a curve on which no elementary move makes a difference in the local adjacency structure .",
    "this means that it comes from a loop in the dual graph , which we will exclude by considering @xmath288 .",
    "if this is not the case , we proceed as follows .",
    "we label the pairs of pants in @xmath35 and @xmath56 with the labels @xmath74,@xmath27, ... ,@xmath258 consistently ( i.e. the pairs of pants that are ` the same ' in @xmath35 and @xmath56 get the same label ) and consider the map @xmath289 that sends vertex @xmath156 to vertex @xmath156 for all @xmath290 . because @xmath35 and @xmath56 are related by an elementary move , @xmath291 preserves the adjacency structure everywhere except around the curve on which the move was performed .",
    "here @xmath291 changes @xmath27 edges . by assumption",
    "we have an isomorphism @xmath292 . because the adjacency structure around the curve on which the move is performed is different in @xmath35 and @xmath56 , the map @xmath293 acts non - trivially on the labels .",
    "this means that the map : @xmath294 is a non - trivial element in @xmath295 with : @xmath296 this is the graph theoretic description we need .    in situation",
    "( ii ) we exclude loops again and we consider the maps @xmath297 and @xmath298 and the isomorphism @xmath299 .",
    "the map : @xmath300 is now a non - trivial map with edge defect : @xmath301    also note that the maps @xmath302 and @xmath303 can not be two cycles , because they both have to move the two vertices around the edge on which the move was performed and can not interchange these .",
    "so in particular , their supports contain at least @xmath0 vertices .",
    "every such map collapses at most @xmath74 of the @xmath304 edges .",
    "so we get that : @xmath305 } \\geq 1-{\\mathbb{p}_{2g-2}\\left[\\substack{\\displaystyle{\\exists \\pi_1,\\ldots,\\pi_m\\in{\\mathrm{s}_{2g-2}}\\backslash\\{\\mathrm{id}\\}}\\\\ \\displaystyle{\\text{such that : } \\mathrm{ed}_{\\pi_i}\\leq 4\\;\\forall i=1,\\ldots , m } \\\\ \\displaystyle{\\text{and } x_{2g-2,1}=x_{2g-2,1}=0 } \\\\ \\displaystyle{\\text{and } \\mathrm{aut}(\\gamma)=\\{e\\}}}\\right]}\\ ] ] where , with a slight abuse of notation , we have identified a subset of @xmath288 with its inverse image under @xmath306 .",

    "applying theorem [ thm_bc ] now finishes the proof .",
    "for the flip graph we have the same result as for the curve graph and the pants graph :                we choose a triangulation @xmath62 of @xmath8 that contains two copies of @xmath316 , with red and blue arcs @xmath324 and @xmath325 respectively and a quadrilateral .",
    "such a triangulation @xmath62 exists because of our condition on @xmath7 .",

    "we will use the results on random triangulated surfaces from section [ sec_randsurf ] .",
    "the proof is analogous to the proof for the modular pants graph .",
    "the main thing we need to control is the degree of the vertices of @xmath331 .    for the upper bound we use the fact that every triangulation @xmath332 contains @xmath333 arcs ,",
    "all of which can be flipped .",
    "this means that @xmath334 . combining this with theorem [ thm_cardfg1 ] and proposition [ prp_general ] gives the upper bound .    for the lower",
