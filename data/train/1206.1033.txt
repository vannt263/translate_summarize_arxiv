    "precision measurements are an essential complement of direct searches for new physics beyond the standard model ( sm )",
    ". the most remarkable successes of this interplay may be the prediction of the existence of the charm quark due to the absence of flavour - changing neutral currents , and the prediction of the top quark mass before its actual discovery . with this philosophy , the construction of a high - energy @xmath8 international linear collider ( ilc ) has been proposed to complement direct searches carried out at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . in the case of the top quark ,",
    "precision measurements of its properties , in particular of its couplings , are specially interesting because it is the heaviest elementary particle yet discovered , and as such it is expected to be more sensitive to new physics at higher scales .    in its first two years of operation , the lhc has not shown any sign of new physics yet .",
    "this implies that new particles coupling to the sm ones have masses above the electroweak symmetry breaking scale @xmath9 gev , and perhaps beyond the tev .",
    "therefore , the effect of these new degrees of freedom in the top quark properties can be parameterised in terms of dimension - six gauge - invariant effective operators  @xcite .",
    "the difference between this framework and previous approaches for the study of @xmath10 at the ilc with anomalous top couplings  @xcite is that here we make use of the full @xmath11 gauge symmetry of the sm , not only the unbroken @xmath12 .",
    "this larger symmetry leads to several interesting implications .",
    "first of all , the effective operator framework allows to reduce the number of independent parameters entering fermion trilinear interactions to four at most  @xcite , one half of the total number of parameters involved in a general off - shell form factor .",
    "second , it allows to set relations between new physics contributions to the top quark interactions , for example between left - handed contributions to the the @xmath13 and @xmath1 vertices .",
    "such relations not only reduce further the number of arbitrary parameters , but also introduce an useful synergy between measurements of different top quark vertices .",
    "last , but not least , this framework is also very convenient since it allows to consistently compute radiative corrections and study the effect of anomalous top interactions in loop observables  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the effect of top trilinear effective operators in @xmath10 at the ilc .",
    "our estimates will show that the ilc sensitivity will largely surpass the one achievable at the lhc , either in top decays ( current one  @xcite or envisaged  @xcite ) or in @xmath14 and @xmath15 production  @xcite .",
    "moreover , our focus is not only in the sensitivity to these operators , but rather on discussing how the different ilc beam polarisation options and cm energies could allow to disentangle the various effective operator contributions to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 vertices .",
    "effective operators can also affect the top decay .",
    "however , since the study and the observables involved are the same as for the lhc  @xcite , we defer their study to future work .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we write down the dimension - six operators involved in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 interactions , which contribute to @xmath10 and obtain expressions for the polarised cross sections and asymmetries . in section  [ sec:3 ] we compare the ilc sensitivity to single operators with present or expected lhc limits .",
    "the possibility to disentangle these operator contributions is discussed in detail in section  [ sec:4 ] . in section  [ sec:5 ]",
    "we draw our conclusions .",
    "a minimal non - redundant set of dimension - six operators contributing to top quark vertices was presented in refs .",
    "the operators contributing to @xmath1 and @xmath2 interactions are only five , @xmath16 \\ ;         ( \\bar q_{l3 } { \\gamma^\\mu}\\tau^i q_{l3 } ) \\ , ,    & & o_{uw}^{33 } = ( \\bar q_{l3 } { \\sigma^{\\mu \\nu}}\\tau^i t_{r } ) \\tilde \\phi \\ , { w_{\\mu \\nu}}^i \\ , , \\notag \\\\ & o_{\\phi q}^{(1,3 + 3 ) } = i ( \\phi^\\dagger \\overleftrightarrow d_\\mu \\phi ) ( \\bar q_{l3 } { \\gamma^\\mu}q_{l3 } ) \\ , ,    & & o_{ub\\phi}^{33 } = ( \\bar q_{l3 } { \\sigma^{\\mu \\nu}}t_{r } ) \\tilde \\phi \\ , { b_{\\mu \\nu}}\\ , , \\notag \\\\ & o_{\\phi u}^{3 + 3 } = i ( \\phi^\\dagger \\overleftrightarrow d_\\mu \\phi ) ( \\bar t_{r } { \\gamma^\\mu}t_{r } ) \\ , , \\label{ec : oall}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using standard notation with @xmath17 the pauli matrices , @xmath18 the left - handed third generation quark doublet , @xmath19 the right - handed top quark singlet , @xmath20 the sm higgs doublet , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 the @xmath24 and @xmath25 field strength tensors , respectively , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) the covariant derivative acting on the right ( left ) and @xmath28 .",
    "the three operators in the left column of eqs .",
    "( [ ec : oall ] ) are hermitian , hence their coefficients are real . including the sm and dimension - six operator contributions , the @xmath1 vertex reads @xmath29 with @xmath30 , @xmath31 ( @xmath32 is the top quark electric charge ) and @xmath33   \\frac{v^2}{\\lambda^2 } \\",

    "the two complex coefficients appear in two linearly independent combinations in the tensorial @xmath38 boson and photon interactions .",
    "the real parts of these combinations , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , correspond to magnetic dipole moments , whereas the imaginary parts @xmath41 , @xmath42 are cp - violating electric dipole moments .",
    "one can perform an additional simplification by noticing that the contribution from dimension - six operators to the @xmath43 vertex  @xcite , @xmath44   \\frac{v^2}{\\lambda^2 } \\,,\\ ] ] involves precisely the same operators as in the @xmath45 vertex .",

    "( [ ec : ztt ] ) is used . )",
    "the bottom quark couplings have been probed with great precision at petra , lep and sld .",
    "thus , given the precision that is expected for top couplings at the lhc and ilc , it is a good approximation to assume @xmath47 since non - zero contributions from these operators must be balanced in order to keep the @xmath48 vertex close to its sm value . besides",
    ", we point out that the exact equality between these coefficients automatically holds for some sm extensions , for example with new charge @xmath49 singlets  @xcite , so no fine - tuning is implied here .",
    "we are now in position to compute the @xmath0 cross section at the ilc , including top trilinear operators .",
    "the electron interactions have been probed with an excellent precision without noticing departures from the sm prediction .",
