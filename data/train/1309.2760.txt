    "after more than 75 years of investigations , both the theoretical description and the experimental realization of wigner crystals and wigner molecules , a paradigmatic example of strongly correlated state of electrons in condensed matter , still represent a challenging problem  @xcite .",
    "+ much insight in this fascinating problem has been gained thanks to quantum dots  @xcite , an ideal playground for the study of correlated electron systems . in circular two dimensional ( 2d ) quantum dots",
    "wigner molecules have been extensively studied theoretically  @xcite . here",
    ", the electron density only shows weak signatures of the wigner molecule through a radial ordering , while no angular correlations can be detected due to the rotational symmetry of the system .",
    "the latter can only be probed by means of density - density correlation functions or pair correlation functions ( pcf ) .",
    "several different theoretical tools are employed to study 2d quantum dots but all rely heavily on numerical calculations  @xcite , which limits the most accurate investigations to a rather low number of particles @xmath0 .",
    "experimentally , the key tool to detect wigner molecules in 2d dots is optical - spectroscopy , with results being compared with the numerical predictions of the theory  @xcite .",
    "also the coupling to local probes such as afm or stm tips has been proposed  @xcite . +",
    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems are qualitatively different , in that breaking the translational invariance makes it possible to deserve strong oscillations already at the level of the electron density .",
    "finite - size effects show up as friedel oscillations with a wavevector @xmath1 ( the fermi momentum of the dot ) , while electron correlations induce wigner oscillations characterized by twice the wavevector , i.e. @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "even though 1d systems have also been approached by means of numerical techniques  @xcite the peculiar nature of the low - energy excitations of interacting 1d systems , described by the luttinger liquid theory  @xcite , allows to employ bosonization techniques to obtain analytical results  @xcite also concerning the transport properties of such systems  @xcite .",
    "the analytical study of the electron density of an interacting 1d quantum dot within the luttinger liquid theory is particularly simple at zero temperature : the friedel and the wigner contributions are well separated and their relative importance is governed by the interaction parameter of the theory  @xcite . for increasing temperatures ,",
    "the thermal activation of spin excited states leads to a suppression of the friedel term and the emergence of clearer wigner signatures  @xcite .",
    "it is however interesting to assess whether this behaviour is observed also in two - particle probes such as the pcf , which are a direct measure of the degree of correlation induced by electronic interactions . indeed ,",
    "ab initio calculations confirm this quantity as a sensitive tool to assess the degree of correlations also in 1d systems  @xcite .",
    "+ in this work we analytically evaluate the pcf of a strongly interacting 1d quantum dot , in the presence of both friedel and wigner oscillations . employing the spin - coherent luttinger liquid picture  @xcite we include thermal effects up to a temperature @xmath3 with @xmath4 the spin excitation energy .",
    "our analytical approach circumvents the typical restriction to low @xmath5 of purely numerical approaches and allows in principle to easily investigate systems with an arbitrarily large number of particles .",
    "both the friedel and the wigner oscillations induce peculiar patterns in the pcf .",
    "the wigner term induces @xmath6 distinct peaks of the pcf , while the friedel term tends to favor their grouping in pairs .",
    "a crossover towards the wigner regime is observed as interactions are stronger .",
    "we find that the pcf is indeed sensitive to thermal effects : indeed , the grouping induced by the friedel oscillations tends to disappear leading to an emergence of the wigner correlations akin to the phenomenon shown by the single - particle density .",

    "[ sec : model ] we briefly introduce the spin - coherent luttinger model for the 1d strongly interacting quantum dot , and give analytic expression for the electron density and the pcf .",

    "<S> the pair correlation function of a strongly interacting one - dimensional quantum dot is evaluated analytically within the framework of the spin coherent luttinger liquid model . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of electron interactions and temperature on the competition between finite - size effects and electronic correlations is analyzed , also in the regime of large numbers of particles . </S>",
    "<S> the development of wigner molecule correlations is observed as interactions get stronger . </S>",
    "<S> the visibility of such signatures is enhanced for temperatures comparable with the spin excitation energy of the system due to a suppression of the uncorrelated friedel contribution to the pair correlation function .    </S>",
