    "beam diffusion can lead to emittance growth , halo formation and particle loss .",
    "a standard method currently used to measure transverse diffusion requires scraping the beam with collimator jaws moved close to the beam , then retracting the jaws and waiting for the beam to diffuse to the outer position of the jaws @xcite .",
    "this procedure is time consuming and the method is only applicable to storage rings where the beam circulates for times long enough to enable the measurement .",
    "beam echoes were introduced into accelerator physics more than two decades ago as a novel method to measure diffusion @xcite .",
    "a single echo observation can be done typically within a thousand turns with nonlinear tune spreads in the range 0.001 - 0.01 .",
    "hence diffusion measurements with echoes would be considerably faster than the standard method and could also enable diffusion to be measured in synchrotrons where beams circulate for relatively short times .    shortly after the introduction of the beam echo concept ,",

    "this ring offers the opportunity of testing a fast diffusion measurement technique which could help determine the degree of integrability ( or stable motion ) among different lattice models . with this motivation ,",
    "we revisit the earlier rhic measurements with an updated theoretical model to enable extraction of self - consistent diffusion coefficients . in section",
    "ii we describe the updated model , in section iii we apply this model to the rhic data , in section iv we consider beam related time scales and we summarize in section v with lessons to be applied to future echo measurements .",

    "an intensity scan was done with all other parameters kept constant . while the turn by turn data from that scan is not easily accessible , the echo amplitudes are available with 27 data points .",
    "this data can be used to measure the diffusion coefficients as a function of bunch intensity .",
    "both @xmath57 coefficients can be found by a least square minimization of the fit to the amplitude .",
    "this process allows a determination of @xmath57 as a function of intensity , the left plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : au_fit_intensity ] shows the @xmath29 values found and a linear fit to the values .",
    "this confirms the behavior seen in the previous section but now with a larger data set .",
    "similarly as earlier , the @xmath30 values are nearly independent of the intensity",
    ". we can parameterize the echo amplitude s dependence on intensity via these fits for @xmath34 and the amplitude equation ( [ eq : amp_d1_d2 ] ) .",
    "the linear fit yields @xmath111 where @xmath93 is the intensity in units of 10@xmath112 while for @xmath113 we take the mean value over this set , @xmath114 the right plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : au_fit_intensity ] shows the measured echo amplitudes ( in red ) as a function of the intensity and also the calculated amplitude ( in blue ) from these fits for @xmath57 . the measured echo amplitude decreases with increasing intensity , and this trend is well reproduced by the theoretical amplitude function .",
    "this is a consistency check and is to be expected , since the linear fit for @xmath41 and constant for @xmath113 were obtained from the data set .",
    "the comparison in fig . [ fig : au_fit_intensity ] shows that we can parameterize the diffusion coefficients as d(j ) = [ a_10 + a_11n ] ( ) + a_20()^2 where @xmath115 are functions of machine and beam parameters such as the nonlinearity , tunes , emittance etc .",
    "but independent of the intensity .",
    "space charge effects and intra - beam scattering ( ibs ) are the dominant source of particle diffusion for heavy ions such as au in rhic , at injection energy .",
    "the incoherent space charge and ibs induced diffusion and emittance growth depends linearly on the intensity and our analysis confirms that the leading diffusion coefficient @xmath29 increases linearly with intensity .",
    "the coefficient @xmath30 is likely to be determined by diffusion from single particle nonlinear dynamics processes .",
    "one useful time scale that can be extracted from the diffusion coefficients is the mean escape time associated with probabilistic processes @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in the case that @xmath116 , the time dependent density distribution solution @xmath117 to the diffusion equation leads to a beam lifetime @xmath118 which is close to the escape time @xmath119 estimate . defining @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the particle number , it was shown that t_l = 0.7 , t_esc = where @xmath122 is the action at the absorbing boundary .",
    "we will assume that the mean escape time is also a useful beam relevant time scale when @xmath123 .",
    "the mean escape time from an action @xmath124 to an absorbing boundary at action @xmath122 is given by t_esc(j ) & = & _ j^j_a dj = _",
    "j^j_a dj + & = & averaging this over the initial beam distribution @xmath125 , we have t_esc & = & _ 0^ dj + & = & a_f [ eq : escape ] where @xmath126 is the incomplete gamma function and we have assumed @xmath127 .",
    "the dimensionless amplifying factor @xmath128 , defined by the terms in square brackets , depends only the ratios @xmath129 , figure [ fig : escape_d1_d2 ] shows the dependence of the dimensionless terms on @xmath130 for three values of @xmath131 corresponding to apertures at ( 6,10 , 12)@xmath72 respectively .     for @xmath132 ,",
    "@xmath128 is of order unity .",
    "hence the mean escape time is determined primarily by @xmath133 . in the case that @xmath134 , the time scale would be determined by @xmath135 . with @xmath136 m , and",
    "taking a representative value @xmath137m@xmath15/s from table [ table : d1_d2_amp_fwhm ] , we have @xmath138s . while this time is extremely short , it corresponds to the lifetime of a beam at large amplitudes and not to a beam circulating on the nominal closed orbit .",
    "observations in rhic did show that lifetimes of kicked beams were significantly smaller compared to that for beams not kicked .",
    "however the early losses of the kicked beams were dominated by scraping at aperture restrictions , so there is no straightforward way to determine the contribution of diffusion to those lifetimes .",
    "nevertheless , the diffusion coefficients and the associated time scales should be useful for relative measures of beam growth and particle loss .",
    "as an example , it could be useful in iota to quickly distinguish between lattices with different degrees of integrability .",
    "if echoes can be generated by small amplitude kicks , then the calculated diffusion coefficients and the time scales would be more representative of beam behavior under nominal conditions .",
    "determining the diffusion coefficients may require different parameterizations of @xmath14 at small and large amplitudes , as seen for example in @xcite .",
    "in this article , we revisited earlier observations of transverse beam echoes in rhic to extract diffusion coefficients from those measurements .",
    "we considered three models for the action dependence of the diffusion coefficients : @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 .",
    "all three models were found to adequately describe the echo amplitudes measured during scans of the nonlinear detuning and the delay between the dipole and quadrupole kicks .",
    "next , turn by turn data was used to extract both the amplitude and the fwhm of the pulse width . here both models with @xmath28 do not describe the data with larger pulse widths , so the only model that successfully describes both the amplitude and the fwhm data is the @xmath57 model .",
    "we find that @xmath29 is an order of magnitude larger than @xmath30 in most cases , it increases linearly with the intensity while @xmath30 is nearly independent of the intensity . using these intensity dependencies",
    ", the @xmath57 model also adequately describes another set of data where the echo amplitudes were measured as a function of intensity .",
    "these results show that transverse echoes can indeed be used to measure transverse beam diffusion in existing and future hadron synchrotrons , we make some observations on requirements for future measurements .",
    "the diffusion measurements require good control of several machine and beam parameters such as the initial dipole kick , the quadrupole kick , machine nonlinearity , tunes and beam emittance , to name the most important .",
    "injection oscillations can strongly influence the echo amplitude and pulse shape , so these need to be controlled to the extent possible . alternatively if available , a fast dipole kicker in the ring would be preferable to initiate the echo .",
    "in such a case , a transverse damper can damp initial oscillations and then be turned off before the dipole kicker is used .",
    "while the echo amplitude variation with scans of the detuning and time delay are useful , detailed analysis of the turn by turn data yields more information . as an example of this , we found that the fwhm scales quadratically with the intensity and therefore is more sensitive to intensity changes than the echo amplitude .",
    "the proximity of resonances can also spoil echoes so the tunes and the dipole kick amplitudes need to be chosen carefully as well .",
