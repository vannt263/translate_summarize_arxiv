    "neutron stars ns are evolved stars being created after the death of a massive star via a supernova explosion or a transition from a white dwarf accretion or dynamical instabilities .",
    "their interiors can reach up to several times the saturation density @xmath0 , the canonical density inside atomic nuclei .",
    "it is quite uncertain what is the state of matter under such high density conditions , therefore research on equation of state eos is currently a very active area .",
    "it is important to note that in ns temperature does nt play a major role in the computation of the eos , thus it can be neglected .",
    "recent observations have completely changed our understanding of the cold , dense nuclear matter in such compact star interiors .    in this context",
    ", accurate mass determination has proved to be of great importance . in particular the observation of the 2m@xmath1 pulsars , psr j0348 + 0432  @xcite and psr j1614 - 2230  @xcite ,",
    "have strongly constrained the stiffness of the ns eos . on the contrary ,",
    "radius measurements are not yet precise enough to test , discard , and select some of the many alternative eos models .",
    "for instance , frequency resolved pulse shape analysis for the nearest millisecond pulsar  @xcite supports relatively large radii while analysis from x - ray bursters  @xcite point out to either moderate or short radii .",
    "promising future radius measurements include upcoming space missions , cf .",
    "nicer  @xcite .",
    "energetic phenomena like fast radio bursts frb , - millisecond duration radio bursts from cosmological distances @xcite can be explained by compact stars by collapse into a black hole  . under such scheme , the released energy of the process is @xmath2 erg .",
    "this scenario is not to be confused by early ns evolution consisting of hot protoneutron stars , with deconfinement transition in their interior that could serve as the mechanism triggering the core collapse supernovae  @xcite , as well as pulsar kicks at birth  @xcite associated to more energetic emissions .",
    "neutron stars can suffer a dynamical collapse caused by a deconfinement phase transition in their cores ( possibly leading to a _ corequake _ ) via spin - down due to the continuous electromagnetic emission or by mass accretion .",
    "some early works estimated the energy reservoir for the typical ( @xmath3m@xmath1 ) ns mass , however here we present a recent eos model derived in that allows for the formation of a `` third family '' of compact stars near the maximum mass .",
    "figure  [ fig : mvsr ] shows both gravitational and baryonic masses for compact star configurations with a transition at high masses .",
    "we denote the two stars before and after the transition as `` high mass twins '' because we assume that they bear the same baryonic mass while differing in their mass - energy quantity ( binding energy ) .",
    "values : 0.0 , 1.0 , 3.0 , 5.0 , 7.0 , 10.0 starting from the upper left corner down to the bottom right . notice that the higher the @xmath4 value the higher the mass at the instability.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    although the detailed mechanism is at the moment being developed  @xcite , we can conjecture the following : a deconfinement phase transition occurs via a corequake scenario in which a _ high - mass _ hadronic ns collapses into a hybrid compact star disconnected from the former by a gap in the stable configurations ( for a recent classification of hybrid stars , see @xcite ) .",
    "the instability sets in by the pure hadronic ns after dipole - emission spin - down , or accretion - induced spin - up by matter from a companion .    for these energy bursts to occur it is important to note that in cold neutron stars the temperatures in their interiors are well below the neutrino opacity temperature ( @xmath51mev ) such that the free streaming scenario applies for neutrino propagation as opposed to the neutrino diffusion mostly suitable for a gamma ray burst scenario involving a hot ( proto ) neutron star ( @xmath6 1mev ) .",
    "a new aspect of this mechanism , going beyond the scenario of falcke & rezzolla ( a direct collapse of a magnetized ns to a black hole  ) is the existence of a metastable state between the initial and final states of a supramassive rotating neutron star suron that could explain a double peak structure of the frb s for which recently a case has been made  @xcite .",
    "this metastate in the suron process corresponds to an object on the third family branch of high mass hybrid stars , as found recently for microscopically motivated eos  .",
    "we call neutron star _ twins _ those stars with the same mass having different composition and thus different radius .",
    "they belong to different branches in the disconnected mass - radius diagram .",
    "one of them is pure hadronic whereas the twin star is a hybrid containing quark matter in its core  .",
    "the case of high mass twins is of great importance because is a consequence of a critical point in the qcd phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they do not lead to many of the modern issues of compact star physics as discussed in @xcite : masquerades @xcite , the hyperon puzzle @xcite , and reconfinement  .",
    "bayesian studies based on the most reliable observations provide a useful assessment of high mass twins identification  @xcite .",
    "the description of the eos used here is as follows :    * for hadronic matter we utilize the dd2 eos with excluded volume correction ( resulting from the internal compositions of nucleons produced by pauli blocking effects of quarks  @xcite ) that acts at suprasaturation densities and provides stiffening to this eos . for neutron stars",
    "this means that the highest mass can be reached at a rather lower interior density values and are characterized by large radii ( @xmath7 km , @xcite ) . *",
    "quark matter is described by a njl eos with multiquark interactions hnjl  @xcite featuring a coupling strength parameter in the vector channel of the 8-quark interaction @xmath4 bringing this quark eos to a sufficient stiffening at high densities in order to support the maximum observed star mass of 2  m@xmath8 .",
    "alternatively , an equation of state based on the string - flip model  @xcite captures the same features ( excluded volume ) , but has the advantage of resulting in a broader range of radius difference between the twins ( in better agreement with the contrasting either large or short radius observations ) .",
    "the mass - radius diagrams for the string - flip compact stars is shown in figure  [ fig : sf - twins ] .",
    "values as reported in  @xcite .",
    "the vertical bands around 2m@xmath8 correspond to the most precisely massive ns measurements  @xcite .",
    "figure taken from  @xcite.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]",
    "the eos of features a first order phase transitions leading to the instability of the ns right after the appearance of a small , dense quark core .",
    "when the ns reaches the maximum hadronic mass radial oscillations take over creating an instability  ( see e.g. @xcite ) , which results into a dynamical collapse .",
    "the criterion for unstable configurations is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the central density of the corresponding ns . in figure",
    "[ fig : mvsr ] the configurations in between circles ( maximum hadronic mass ns and its hybrid twin ) that have a positive slope are thus forbidden .",
    "this is the origin of the gap created by such prohibited configurations in the mass - radius diagram .",
    "@xmath11{fig1 } & \\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{fig2}\\\\ \\end{array}$ ]    figure  [ energy_released ] ( left panel ) shows the radius change @xmath12 in the transition , which is between @xmath13 and @xmath14 km for some coupling constant values .",
    "the available energy @xmath15 following the transition equals the mass - energy difference @xmath16 between the initial and final configurations and is of about @xmath17 erg . see figure  [ energy_released ] ( right panel ) .",
    "the more realistic case of rotation configurations are being currently studied  @xcite .",
    "we conclude this work by drawing attention to the possibility of energetic emissions produced by a deconfinement phase transition in ns interiors most likely via frb s , such as the case of the recent observations of frb121002 @xcite featuring a double peak light curve structure .",
    "we identify this double peak signal with the metastable state in the dynamical collapse scenario of a suron .",
    "furthermore , it is of great importance to mention that the ns eos presented here can serve as an input to understand scenarios of cosmic ray generation via supernova explosions or ns mergers .",
