    "the large n limit of four dimensional non - abelian gauge theories is interesting from the view point of qcd phenomenology  @xcite and string theory  @xcite .",
    "lattice qcd is a useful technique for extracting fundamental results in the large n limit of qcd .",
    "fermions are naturally quenched in the t hooft limit of large n qcd and this significantly reduces the computational cost in a lattice calculation .",
    "in addition , there is a concept of continuum reduction  @xcite , namely , physics does not depend on the size of box @xmath0 for @xmath1 and @xmath2 is a physical critical size .",
    "these two observations have been used to extract physical results in the large n limit of qcd using numerical techniques on the lattice .",
    "large n qcd on a continuum torus @xmath0 has several phases  @xcite depending upon the size of the torus as shown in fig .",
    "[ fourd ] .",
    "the continuum action has @xmath3 symmetries associated with the polyakov loops in the four directions and the various phases correspond to the number of directions in which this symmetry is broken .",
    "the continuum limit is obtained by going to the top - right corner of fig .",
    "[ fourd ] and different approaches to this corner will result in one of the five continuum phases .",
    "the @xmath4h - phase present for @xmath5 for all @xmath6 is an unphysical phase that does not survive the continuum limit .",
    "the @xmath4h to @xmath4c transition is associated with the single plaquette operator opening up a gap around @xmath7 in its eigenvalue distribution .",
    "gauge fields come in disconnected pieces in all the @xmath8c - phases due to the presence of the gap in the single plaquette operator  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4c - phase is the confined phase of large n qcd and the @xmath9c - phase is the deconfined phase and @xmath10 .",
    "an immediate consequence of continuum reduction is that large n qcd does not feel temperatures below @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "numerical analysis has shown that lattice spacing effects are small in the @xmath4c - phase and it is sufficient to work at @xmath12 and @xmath13 to extract continuum results .",
    "therefore , numerical computations can be performed on a serial computer and a cluster of computers can be efficiently used to generate statistics in a monte - carlo calculation .",
    "since physics does not depend on the box size in @xmath4c - phase , one should show that chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken in finite volume in order to properly reproduce physics in this phase  @xcite .",
    "the order of limits are important and one has to take the large n limit before taking the quark mass to zero at finite phsyical volume . the low lying spectrum of the massless dirac operator shows evidence for spontaneous chiral breaking since the eigenvalues , @xmath14 , scales like @xmath15 with @xmath16 obeying a universal distribution .",
    "the chiral condesate , @xmath17 , is independent of @xmath18 .",
    "results of a calculation of the chiral condensate on the lattice is shown in fig .",
    "[ sigma ] .",
    "results from chiral random matrix theory  @xcite were used to extract the chiral condensate at a fixed @xmath19 , @xmath6 and lattice coupling .",
    "two lowest non - zero eigenvalues in the @xmath20 and @xmath21 topological sectors were used to show consistency .",
    "the plot shows that there is a limit as @xmath22 and this limit is independent of @xmath6 .",
    "results obtained at different lattice couplings yield @xmath23",
    "since chiral symmetry is broken in large n qcd even in finite volume , one should be able to observe massless pions in finite volume .",
    "this result emerges in the following manner  @xcite .",
    "properties of a single quark in a background gauge field @xmath24 can not depend on a shift of @xmath25 for arbitrary @xmath26 since the @xmath3 symmetries associated with the polyakov loops are not broken in the @xmath4c - phase .",
    "but the propagator of a non - singlet meson will depend on @xmath26 , if one quark sees @xmath27 and the other sees @xmath28 as their respective gauge fields .",
    "this is referred to as the quenched momentum prescription  @xcite for the computation of meson propagators in the large n limit of qcd .",
    "one can use the results for the chiral condensate , @xmath29 , and critical lattice size , @xmath30 , to plot the pion mass as a function of @xmath31 .",
    "the results fall on a single universal curve as shown in fig .",
    "[ pion ] and @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath4c to @xmath9c phase transition is the confinement - deconfinement phase transition since the @xmath33 symmetry associated with one of the polyakov loops is broken .",
    "this transition is first order since there is a latent heat associated with the single plaquette  @xcite .",
    "the fermion determinant does matter in the @xmath9c - phase and it picks the correct boundary conditions for fermions in the broken direction , namely , anti - periodic with respect to the polyakov loop  @xcite .",
    "the lowest eigenvalue of the dirac operator with the correct boundary conditions can be used to study the gap in the @xmath9c - phase and one finds that chiral symmetry is restored in the @xmath9c - phase  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the chiral transition is first order as shown in fig .",
    "if one were to super - cool the @xmath9c - phase into the @xmath4c - phase , a second order transition with a square root singularity would be observed at @xmath34 .",
    "non - abelian gauge theories in the confined phase are strongly interacting at large distances and weakly interacting at short distances .",
    "if this is seen as a phase transition in some observable , one could use the universal behavior of this transition to connect the low energy physics of qcd to the high energy physics of qcd .",
    "the wilson loop operator as a function of its size is the most likely candidate to study this transition within the @xmath4c - phase of large n qcd  @xcite .",
    "such a transition exists in two dimensional large n qcd  @xcite and it is claimed that the transition in four dimensional qcd is in the same universality class . this transition is referred to as the durhuus - olesen phase transition in fig  [ fourd ] .",
    "wilson loop operators suffer from a perimeter divergence in four dimensions and one has to eliminate it when defining this operator if one were to study its eigenvalue distribution .",
    "one possible way to suppress the perimeter divergence is to use smeared operators on the lattice .",
    "numerical studies of the eigenvalue distribution of the smeared wilson loop operator on the lattice shows clear evidence for a phase transition as a function of the size of the wilson loop  @xcite .",
    "the universality class is the same as the one found in two dimensional large n qcd as shown in fig .",
    "[ wilson ] and the critical loop size is roughly @xmath35 .",
