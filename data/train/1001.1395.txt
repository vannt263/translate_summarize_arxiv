    "both j0754 and j0736 are new variables found with dasch .",
    "the lightcurves of color variations back in time would constrain variable extinction , but is difficult to derive from dasch .",
    "the majority of the harvard plate collection are blue sensitive plates , and a small fraction of plates used filters to produce red and yellow sensitive measurements with details of wavelength responses unavailable . in order to generate consistent magnitudes , we did color - term fitting for the plates in annular bins to derive the effective color - term @xmath7 in plates ( laycock et al .",
    "2010 ) , where @xmath7 of a given plate is defined by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the effective magnitude in the plate , @xmath10 is the gsc2 @xmath10 magnitude and @xmath11 is the gsc2 @xmath11 magnitude .",

    "each pair of plates gives a ( b - r ) color of the object at that time .",

    "luminosity class i and v are ruled out ) .",
    "we estimated metallicities [ fe / h]@xmath14 for j0830 , and [ fe / h]@xmath15 for j0754 and j0736 , by comparing with fast spectra of several standard k giant stars with known metalicities ( faber et al .",
    "we also found that j0830 and j0754 do not show velocity changes within measurement errors ( @xmath16 km / s ) , while j0736 showed significant radial velocity changes in three different epochs , i.e. @xmath17 km / s on feb 4th , @xmath18 km / s on feb 19th , and @xmath19 km / s on april 18th , 2009 , and is then probably in a close binary .",
    "as shown in figure 3 , all three variables show ca ii k and h emission lines in the absorption core , indicating the presence of active chromospheres .",
    "ca ii k and h emission lines are common among cool dwarf and evolved stars , signaling the magnetic dynamo activity in chromospheres ( kraft 1967 ; soderblom 1983 ; dupree & smith 1995 ) .",

    "table 1 lists the galactic coordinates , gsc2.3.2 b - r colors , gsc b , asas v and 2mass jhk magnitudes , [ fe / h ] , proper motions , radial velocities , distances , and galactic velocities for the three variables . j0830 and j0754 have high proper motions ( @xmath27 mas / yr ) , while j0736 has no proper motion within its error of @xmath28 mas / yr . the 3 stars are about @xmath29 pc above the galactic plane . j0830 and j0754 have velocities about 100 km / s , while j0736 probably has smaller velocity @xmath30 km / s . our spectra indicate metallicities [ fe / h]@xmath31 to 0",
    ". they are most probably thick disk giants ( carollo et al .",
    "the 2mass @xmath32 color of j0830 is 0.27 , which is redder than @xmath33 expected for a k2 giant ( covey et al .",
    "note that j0830 also showed large reddening in the 1970s and 1980s in our plates during its dimming , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "as k2iii stars with [ fe / h]@xmath31 to 0 , the 3 erratic variables could be on the red giant branch ( rgb ) , but not near the tip , on the horizontal branch ( hb ) , or early asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "timescales of 10 - 100 year are too long to be pulsations driven by ionization ( percy 2007 ) , or convective instabilities which have timescales in the order of a year for a k giant ( prialnik 2000 ) .",
    "the lightcurves of these 3 erratic variables look somewhat like r coronae borealis ( rcb ) stars .",
    "rcb stars are rare , hydrogen deficient , carbon - rich supergiants which undergo large amplitude ( @xmath34 mag ) fading events lasting weeks to a few years as dust condensates to block the light along the line of sight ( clayton 1996 ) .",
    "our variables share some of these typical rcb lightcurve features , and the lightcurve of j0830 is similar to some hot ( @xmath35 k ) rcb stars ( de marco et al .",
    "dust obscuration events have also been observed in some other carbon rich stars .",
    "whitelock et al . ( 2006 ) found about one - third of the carbon - rich miras and other agb stars undergo dimming episodes .",
    "however , all of the three variables presented here are very different from normal rcb stars in the following aspects , and therefore are not rcb stars ( or any other type of carbon - rich agb stars ) : they are not post - agb supergiants like rcb stars ( alcock et al .",
    "2001 ) ; much cooler than most rcbs ; have much longer variability timescales and much smaller amplitudes than average rcb stars ; have no strong carbon absorption bands , and have strong hydrogen absorption lines .",
    "j0830 has weaker h@xmath36 absorption which might due to the chromospheric emission in the core , since the ca ii emission lines are very strong in j0830 and h@xmath36 emission is usually strongly correlated with ca ii lines ( cincunegui et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "some symbiotic stars also show irregular long - term variations ( see e.g. sokoloski et al .",
    "2006 ; skopal 2008 ) . however , there is no symbiotic signature in our variables , such as nebula emission lines or combination spectra .",
    "there is no common model that works well for these 3 erratic variables , as we discuss below .",
    "the first possible model is dimming caused by obscuration of dust shells ejected from the star , which is consistent with our observation that the object became redder when it was fainter and its redder 2mass @xmath32 color .",
    "however , how to produce and maintain the dust for such a long time is not clear . for rgb stars ,",
    "significant mass loss occurs only at the very tip ( origlia et al .",
    "2002 ) , which is much too luminous for the three erratic variables .",
    "bedding et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found a 5-yr dimming event in the oxygen - rich , mira - like variable l@xmath37 pup , likely due to absorption by a dust shell containing silicates .",
    "l@xmath37 pup is located near the tip of the agb , and thus has high mass - loss rate ( @xmath38 yr @xmath39 ) , which if applied to our k2iii stars would require they have low metallicity and be halo stars .",
    "tsuji ( 2009 ) found excess absorption in co lines of arcturus ( k1.5iii ) , and proposed it might be caused by the formation of molecular clouds in the outer atmosphere .",
    "arcturus only shows low amplitude optical variations of a few percent ( bedding 2000 ) and thus the absorption due to such molecular clouds is not enough to account for the 1 magnitude dimming events in the three erratic variables .",
    "a second possible model , is the lithium flash near the rgb luminosity bump ( palacios et al .",
    "2001 ) , which proposed that rotation induced mixing leads to a thin and unstable lithium burning shell , which leads to an increase of nuclear luminosity , and mass loss which might account for the formation of a dust shell around the star and thus the reddening of the star .",
    "all of our 3 variables are chromospherically active and probably fast rotators , which fit to this model .",
    "however , the variation timescale and amplitude of surface luminosity in this model is unknown .",
    "a third possible model , which may be the most plausible one , is the evolution phase when the star is leaving the hb and beginning to ascend the agb , at the point that helium is exhausted in the core and helium burning is ignited in a surrounding shell .",
    "this could apply to the point l in figures 2 and 4 of sackmann et al .",
    "we plotted the evolutionary tracks for @xmath40 $ ] ( [ fe / h]@xmath0 - 0.4 if assume the same composition as the sun ) from girardi et al . ( 2000 ) , and found stars with mass @xmath41 @xmath42 are crossing this evolutionary phase near @xmath43 k and @xmath44 ( which is the temperature and luminosity for k2iii stars ; cox 2000 ) .",
    "the ignition of the helium - burning shell causes expansion and makes the hydrogen - burning shell expand and cool , which makes the surface luminosity decline and the color redden , and then recover later . if this process is similar to thermal pulses in he - burning shell of later agb stars , then first the surface luminosity decreases by a factor of 2 over 50 - 100 yr , and then increases by a factor of 2 over 200 yr ( mowlavi 1999 ) , which is roughly consistent with j0830 and j0736 . more theoretical study and simulations of this evolution phase",
    "may clarify the nature of our variables .",
    "two other interesting observations might be related to the three erratic variables .",
    "edmonds & gilliland ( 1996 ; hereafter eg96 ) found a new class of variable stars in k giants with amplitudes @xmath45 mmag and periods of days clumped in the color - magnitude diagram with b - v=1.1 - 1.2 , which is the location of k2iii stars .",
    "they lie on both the agb and the rgb .",
    "bedin et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found a ` heap ' in the luminosity function which is about 1.4 magnitude brighter than the rgb bump , and in the case of 47 tuc , the heap is in a similar location on the rgb to the variables found by eg96 .",
    "the heap and the new class variables are not well understood yet ( see e.g. salaris et al . 2002 ) , and it is surprising that they have similar color and luminosity class as our erratic variables , which show much longer timescale and larger amplitude variations .",
    "there might be some intrinsic link between the objects in the three independent observations . in figure 4 of sackmann",
    "et al . ( 1993 ) , the location of the he - shell ignition is just about 0.6 dex , i.e. 1.5 magnitude , brighter than the rgb bump , consistent with the luminosity of k giant variables in eg96 .",
    "this star is not yet included in any known variable catalogs .",
    "the sharper decline and slower recovery are similar to what is seen in rcb stars .",
    "it might be puffing off outer layers at irregular intervals , which blocks the light from the star .",
    "this variable is probably a binary .",
    "given its possible orbital period of @xmath46 days ( @xmath47 km / s change in radial velocities from feb .",
    "4 th to feb .",
    "19th ) and its ca k and h line emission , it might share some properties in common with rs cvn systems .",
    "it is not yet included in any known variable catalogs .",
    "similar to j0830 and j0736 , it might be puffing off out layers which blocks the light from the star , as supported by the measured reddening during dimming ; it might also be lithium flash near the rgb bump , or the he - shell ignition in the lower agb , as discussed in section 3.1",
