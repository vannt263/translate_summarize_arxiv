    "there exists an afm coupling between the top and bottom layers , @xmath14 the sign of @xmath15 is negative reflecting that the interlayer interaction is antiferromagnetic .",
    "we assume that the spins in the top layer are pointing upward .",
    "then the spins in the bottom layer are pointing downward due to the interlayer afm couplings",
    ".        * topological number . *",
    "the classical field @xmath16 is introduced for the spin texture in the fm system by considering the zero limit of the the lattice constant , @xmath17 .",
    "the ground - state spin textures are @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "a magnetic skyrmion is a spin texture which has a quantized topological number .",
    "spins swirl continuously around the core and approach the ground - state value asymptotically .",
    "the skyrmion is characterized by the topological number @xmath20 in each layer , @xmath21 we obtain @xmath22 for a skyrmion in a sufficiently large area .",
    "we also call @xmath20 the skyrmion number . even if the skyrmion spin texture is deformed , its skyrmion number does not change , as far as the boundary condition is not modified",
    ". it can be neither destroyed nor separated into pieces , _",
    "i.e. _ , a skyrmion is topologically protected .",
    "the spins in the top and bottom layers are tightly bounded due to the afm coupling . accordingly ,",
    "if one skyrmion is created in the top layer , a second skyrmion is also created in the bottom layer ( fig.[fig2]a ) simultaneously .",
    "the topological number of the bottom layer is opposite to that of the top layer since all the spins are inverted , @xmath23 .",
    "see fig.[fig2]b how these topological numbers evolve after the creation of a skyrmion in the top layer .",
    "* excitation energy .",
    "* we may determine numerically the spin profile of each skyrmion and estimate the excitation energy based on the hamiltonian @xmath24 .",
    "we compared the energy of one bilayer - skyrmion state and the energy of the homogeneous state in fig.[fig2]c as a function of the dmi .",
    "similar result is obtained for any value of the interlayer afm coupling strength .",
    "this is because the spin directions between the top and bottom layers are always opposite .",
    "the energy of the bilayer - skyrmion becomes lower than that of the uniform ground state for @xmath25 mj m@xmath26 , which is the threshold value .",
    "consequently , the bilayer - skyrmion excitation is energetically favorable when the dmi strength is larger than the threshold value .",
    "however , spontaneous generation of skyrmions does not occur due to the topological protection .",
    "nevertheless , the topological protection can be violated in condensed matter physics because of the existence of the lattice structure and the boundary of the sample .",
    "we may create skyrmions by leveraging these properties .",
    "* skyrmion hall effect . *",
    "it is well understood@xcite that the center - of - mass motion of a skyrmion is determined by the lagrangian , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the berry phase term of the spin texture , @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the potential . here , @xmath31 is the gyromagnetic coupling constant representing the magnus force with @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the center - of - mass coordinate of the skyrmion .",
    "the euler - lagrange equation yields @xmath34 where @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the force acting on the skyrmion .",
    "consequently , a moving skyrmion feels the magnus force and bends toward the direction perpendicular to the force .",
    "it is called the skyrmion hall effect .",
    "the direction of the magnus force is opposite when the sign of the skyrmion number @xmath37 is opposite .",
    "for instance , if a skyrmion is driven by the current along the @xmath38 direction it will be bended toward the @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) direction in the top ( bottom ) layer .",
    "we may apply a cpp spin - polarized current injection from magnetic tunnel junction ( mtj ) or the spin hall effect in heavy metal layer@xcite .",
    "we numerically solve the landau - lifshitz - gilbert - slonczewski ( llgs ) equation , which governs the dynamics of the magnetization @xmath41 at the lattice site @xmath8 . by suppressing the layer index",

    "we take @xmath54 direction for creating the skyrmion , while @xmath55 direction for moving the skyrmion .",
    "the stt is induced either by injection from a magnetic tunnel junction polarizer or by the spin hall effect@xcite .",
    "alternatively we may apply a cip injection@xcite to move skyrmions .",

    "the spin - polarized current ( polarized along @xmath59 is injected into the top layer in the central circle region , as illustrated in fig.[fig1]a .",
    "we demonstrate how the spin textures develop in fig.[fig2]a .",
    "the spins start to flip in both layers following the spin current injection only in the top layer . when there is no interlayer afm coupling , a skyrmion is formed only in the top layer ( ) . by contrast , a skyrmion is formed also in the bottom layer upon the current injection in the presence of the interlayer afm coupling ( ) .",
    "we show the evolution of the skyrmion number in fig.[fig2]b .",
    "it oscillates at the initial stage for @xmath60 ns , and rapidly increases to @xmath61 .",
    "the skyrmion remains stable even when the current is switched off , demonstrating that it is topologically protected . during this process ,",
    "the spins in the top and bottom layers are always anti - parallel .",
    "a comment is in order .",
    "the saturated skyrmion number is not exactly @xmath62 but @xmath63 .",
    "this is due to the fact that there is a background skyrmion number which originates from the tilting the edge spins .",
    "it is @xmath64 .",
    "accordingly , the calibrated skyrmion number is @xmath65 , which is almost unity .",
    "we present a nucleation phase diagram of a bilayer - skyrmion pair as a function of the current density and the interlayer afm coupling in fig.[fig2]d and fig.[fig2]e . when the magnitude of the injected current is strong enough",
    ", the bilayer - skyrmion is created .",
    "this is due to the fact that spin flip costs a certain energy . on the other hand , if the interlayer afm coupling is too strong , the bilayer - skyrmion is suppressed due to the fact that the nucleation field and the coercivity increases with the interlayer afm exchange , leading to a larger current density for nucleation .",
    "* creation of a bilayer - skyrmion from a bilayer dw pair . *",
    "a magnetic skyrmion can be created from a dw pair by using a junction geometry@xcite . in this scenario",
    "we first make a dw pair into a nanotrack of the top layer through the local cpp injection with @xmath54 direction .",
    "we show how the spins start to flip in the top layer and subsequently in the bottom layer driven by the afm exchange force in fig.[fig3]a .",
    "then , the bilayer dw pair is shifted by applying cpp current , as shown in the process from @xmath66 ps to @xmath67 ps in fig.[fig3]b .",
    "here we consider the vertical injection of a spin current towards @xmath68 and polarized along @xmath55 in the bottom layer .",
    "the cpp injection moves the bilayer dw in the rightward direction .",
    "when the bilayer dw arrives at the junction interface ( @xmath69 ps ) , both the end spins of the dw are pinned at the junction , whereas the central part of the dw continues to move due to stt in the wide part of the nanotrack .",
    "therefore , the structure is deformed into a curved shape and a bilayer - skyrmion texture forms at @xmath70 ps ( ) .",
    "* current - driven motion of a bilayer - skyrmion in a nanotrack . *",
    "the magnetic bilayer - skyrmion can be displaced by the vertical spin - polarized current as in the case of the magnetic skyrmion .",
    "we may employ the cpp injection or the cip injection to drive a bilayer - skyrmion . in general , a moving skyrmion",
    "is easily destroyed by the sample edges due to the skyrmion hall effect .",
    "therefore , the maximum velocity of skyrmion in fm nanotrack is typically much less than 10@xmath71 m / s , limited by the edge confining force@xcite of @xmath72 .",
    "the skyrmion in the top layer follows the motion of the skyrmion in the bottom layer even when the current is not injected into the top layer .",
    "this is because that two skyrmions are bounded by the interlayer afm coupling .",
    "there is no skyrmion hall effect for a magnetic bilayer - skyrmion .",
    "this can be explained as follows .",
    "if there is no interlayer afm coupling , a skyrmion in the top layer moves left - handed and the skyrmion in the bottom layer moves right - handed .",
    "however , when the afm coupling is strong enough , two skyrmions are tightly bounded and the magnus forces acting on the skyrmions between the top and bottom layers are exactly cancelled .",
    "accordingly the bilayer - skyrmion will move straightly .",
    "this mechanism works both for the cpp and cip cases ( ) .",
    "we show the relation between the magnitude of the injected current and the velocity in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "the velocity is proportional to the injected current density . for strong enough current",
    ", the bilayer - skyrmion is destroyed and split into two independent skyrmions .",
    "this is because that the skyrmion hall effect increases as the current increases , which acts as the repulsive force between two skyrmions ( ) .    with strong interlayer afm exchange coupling ,",
    "the coupled skyrmions move along the central line of the nanotrack at a high speed of a few hundred meters per second , without any transverse motion .",
    "however , with small interlayer afm exchange coupling , the skyrmions in the top and bottom layers will be decoupled due to the fast motion of the skyrmion in the bottom layer driven by large current .",
    "once the skyrmions in the top and bottom layers are decoupled , the skyrmion hall effect becomes active , leading to the destruction of skyrmions in the top and/or bottom layer by touching edge . at the same time , in the cpp case , the skyrmion in the top layer will stop motion .",
    "it can be seen that the coupled skyrmions driven by cip current does nt require a fine tuning of damping and non - adiabatic torque coefficients .",
    "it is also worth noting that the interlayer afm coupling does not produce a mass of the bilayer - skyrmion .",
    "when the driving current is suddenly turned off , the bilayer - skyrmion stops high - speed motion immediately ( see supplementary movie 8) . on the other hand",
    ", we also investigated the case where the dmi constant @xmath73 is different between the top and bottom layers .",
    "it is found that the results of current - driven motion of the bilayer - skyrmion do not change much since the dmi only changes the radius of the skyrmion ( see supplementary movies 9 - 10 ) .",
    "the massless property and its robustness make the bilayer - skyrmion an ideal candidate for practical applications .",
    "we have presented a novel solution of inhibiting the hall effect of skyrmions without affecting their topological properties , by exploring a new device made of antiferromagnetically exchange - coupled bilayer nanodisks and nanotracks . compared with the mostly investigated skyrmion in the fm monolayer system ,",
    "the bilayer - skyrmion exhibits entirely distinct characteristics with regard to the current - transport behaviour and robustness .",
    "first , it can move strictly along the direction of the spin current flow , which makes it more appealing for motions in nanowires for ultradense memory applications .",
    "this is in high contrast with the case of monolayer skyrmion , where the skyrmion information carrier can be easily destroyed by the edges of the nanotracks .",
    "second , it will be immune to magnetic field perturbations which might be generated externally or internally within the device circuitry since the net magnetic moment is zero .",
    "third , by introducing the bilayer degree of freedom , the transport properties of the device can be engineered to achieve desired performance .",
    "for example , the skyrmion hall effect can be intentionally suppressed or enhanced by tuning the magnetic properties of individual layers .",
    "this newly proposed solution of transporting skyrmion information carrier for arbitrarily long distances at much enhanced velocity may be very appealing for versatile applications such as ultradense memory and information processing .",
    "similar ideas can be extended to multilayer or superlattice where the skyrmions are strongly coupled to realize a better manipulation of skyrmions in nanotrack or extended thin films .",
    "* modeling and simulation . * the micromagnetic simulations are performed using the object oriented micromagnetic framework ( oommf ) including the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ( dmi ) extended module @xcite .",
    "the time - dependent magnetization dynamics is governed by the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation including spin torque@xcite .",
    "the average energy density @xmath74 is a function of @xmath75 , which contains the intralayer exchange , the interlayer exchange , the anisotropy , the applied field ( zeeman ) , the demagnetization and the dmi energy terms . for micromagnetic simulations ,",
    "the intrinsic magnetic parameters are adopted from refs.@xcite : gilbert damping coefficient @xmath76 and the value for gilbert gyromagnetic ratio is -2.211@xmath77 10@xmath78 m a@xmath79 s@xmath79 .",
    "saturation magnetization @xmath80 = 580 ka m@xmath79 , intralayer exchange stiffness @xmath81 = 15 pj m@xmath79 , dmi constant @xmath73 = 0 @xmath82 6 mj m@xmath26 and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy ( pma ) @xmath12 = 0.8 mj m@xmath83 unless otherwise specified .",
    "the interlayer exchange coefficient @xmath84 is set from 0 to -10 pj m@xmath79 , whereas the corresponding interface exchange coefficient @xmath85 equals from 0 to -10 mj m@xmath26 ( @xmath86 = @xmath15 / 1 nm ) , where `` - '' denotes that the interface is antiferromagnetically coupled . the field - like out - of - plane stt coefficient @xmath47 is set to zero .",
    "all samples are discretized into cells of 2 nm @xmath77 2 nm @xmath77 1 nm in the simulation , which is sufficiently smaller than the typical exchange length ( @xmath82 4.3 nm ) and the skyrmion size to ensure the numerical accuracy . for all simulation of current - driven skyrmions",
    "reported throughout this paper , the skyrmions are firstly created at the designed spot of the nanotrack ( @xmath87 = 100 nm ) by a local spin current perpendicular to the plane of the top layer . then the system is relaxed to an energy minimum state without applying any current .",
    "next , we start the timer and the spin current ( @xmath88 = 0.4 ) is injected into the nanotrack with the geometry of current - in - plane ( cip ) or current - out - of - plane ( cpp ) as shown in fig.[fig1 ] . in the configuration of cip , the electrons flow toward the right in both the top and bottom layers , @xmath89 , the currents flow toward the left , while in the configuration of cpp , the electrons flow toward the top only in the bottom layer .    99 s. mhlbauer et .",

    "<S> when a skyrmion is created in one of the sublayers , another skyrmion is simultaneously created in the other sublayer under certain conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to such a pair of magnetic skyrmions as a magnetic bilayer - skyrmion ( fig.[fig1]d , e ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show a bilayer - skyrmion can be displaced over arbitrarily long distances driven by spin currents without touching the edges due to the absence of the skyrmion hall effect , which is distinct from a skyrmion in the monolayer thin - film structure . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to address the above - mentioned dilemma , bilayer - skyrmions have many distinct characteristics from conventional skyrmions in monolayer thin film , which allow for versatile and multifunctional ultradense and ultrafast information processing and logic applications .        </S>",

    "<S> by contrast , the spin current is perpendicular to the heavy metal / ferromagnetic interface for the cpp case . in our nomenclature for cpp , </S>",
    "<S> the spin current is perpendicular - to - film plane whereas the charge current can be either in the film plane ( such as the spin hall effect scenario ) or perpendicular to the film plane ( such as the perpendicular mram where a perpendicularly magnetized polarizer is incorporated ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cpp scheme has been proven to be much more efficient to move the domain wall or skyrmion than the cip method@xcite .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we first describe the nucleation process of an isolated skyrmion within the top layer by utilizing the cpp injection into a disk composed of two afm - coupled magnetic sublayers . owing to the interlayer afm exchange coupling </S>",
    "<S> , another skyrmion will automatically emerge in the bottom layer . </S>",
    "<S> in so doing we explore various properties of a bilayer - skyrmion . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we move a bilayer - skyrmion in the nanotracks either by the cpp or cip . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the generation of a domain - wall ( dw ) pair and the conversion process from a dw pair to a skyrmion in the bilayer nanotracks . </S>"
