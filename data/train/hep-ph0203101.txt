    "the collision rate at lhc @xcite is foreseen to be 40mhz . to handle such rates a powerful daq system and also fast and efficient trigger algorithms are needed .",
    "the cms collaboration @xcite has chosen a trigger scheme based on two components : a hardware level 1 trigger and a software level 2 trigger . as any collider detector ,",
    "cms is composed of tracker , calorimeter and muon systems . at level 1",
    "the information from the muon and calorimeter systems is used . at level 2 ,",
    "called higher level trigger ( hlt ) in cms , also the tracker contributes to the event selection .",
    "the cms tracker system @xcite is based on two technologies : 1 ) silicon pixel detectors , which are closest to the beam , provide 3-d hits used for vertexing , and 2 ) silicon strip detectors placed at larger radii are used for pattern recognition and track reconstruction .",
    "the amount of information coming from the pixel detector is about 10% of the full tracker , hence it is reasonable to use it at the beginning of the hlt algorithms . in this article we present track reconstruction algorithms based on 3",
    "innermost tracker hits . at low lhc luminosity ( @xmath2 ) ,",
    "when only two pixel layers are foreseen , the third hit is taken from the lowest radius strip detector layer . at high luminosity ( @xmath3 )",
    "the algorithm is based purely on the pixel detector .",
    "the results shown here were obtained with a full geant based simulation of the cms detector using the cmsim @xcite and orca @xcite software packages . the cms inner tracker layout used in the simulation",
    "will be briefly mentioned below , more details can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the pixel detector consists of three barrel layers located at mean radii 4.3  cm , 7.2  cm and 11.0  cm .",
    "the 52  cm long pixel barrel is supplemented by two endcap disks on each side . with this configuration",
    "the pixel detector provides 3 hit coverage up to rapidity @xmath4 . for low luminosity",
    "only two barrel layers will be installed giving 2 pixel hits up to @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath5 silicon strip barrel layer used in our reconstruction algorithm is 89.2 cm long and is located at a mean radius of 23.5 cm",
    "the goal of the cms trigger system is to reduce the event rate from @xmath6 down to @xmath7 that will be stored for off - line analysis .",
    "the daq architecture is designed in such a way that it should sustain maximum output rate of level 1 trigger of @xmath8 and provide hlt acceptance of about @xmath9 . as mentioned in the introduction the level 1 trigger decision",
    "is based on the muon and calorimeter systems , at hlt the tracker information will be added .",
    "even if the full detector information is accessible at htl , fast algorithms which select event topologies of interest and use partial information should be applied first .",
    "two algorithms based on the track reconstruction from the 3 innermost tracker layers will be discussed below , both start from the two innermost pixel layers . for",
    "the @xmath10 hit the first strip layer is used in one algorithm , the second algorithm uses the third pixel layer .",
    "the pixel track finding algorithm has been explained in ref.@xcite , here only the most important details will be given .",
    "it s three essential steps are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pixel_algo ] .",
    "pixel hit pairs from the first two layers ( barrel+barrel or barrel+endcap ) are matched in @xmath11 and @xmath12 to establish track candidates .",
    "the cuts are optimized for a minimum track transverse momentum ( @xmath13 ) of @xmath14 and permit a maximum impact parameter in @xmath11 of @xmath15 . in the @xmath12 plane",
    "the hit pairs have to point to a region in @xmath16 within @xmath17 of the lhc luminous region .",
    "valid pixel pairs are matched with a @xmath10 pixel hit forming a track candidate . using these tracks a list of primary vertices ( pv ) is formed at z values where at least 3 tracks cross the z axis .",
    "tracks which do not point to any pv candidate are erased .",
    "due to the detector overlaps in the @xmath11 direction for some monte carlo tracks more than one track candidate is found .",
    "track pairs which share pixel hits and are closer than @xmath18 from each other are identified .",
    "a cleaning procedure then erases one of the tracks in each pair .",
    "the track finding efficiency is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : track_eff ] where the efficiency ( the ratio of reconstructed to monte carlo tracks ) is shown as a function of the track @xmath13 and rapidity . only reconstructed tracks which have all 3 hits correctly assigned",
    "are counted and the fraction is normalized to all monte carlo tracks which are within the full acceptance of the pixel detector .",
    "the plotted efficiency is for high luminosity lhc events in the presence of minimum bias pile - up interactions ( on the average 20 ) .",
    "however , the comparison is done for the signal tracks only , that is tracks originating from the minimum - bias events are ignored . in the upper part of fig .",
    "[ fig : track_eff ] the reconstruction efficiency and the ghost rate is shown as a function of @xmath13 .",
    "the lower part shows that the efficiency ( for tracks with @xmath19 ) is flat within the rapidity coverage of the pixel detector .",
    "the solid curve shows the absolute efficiency and the dashed curve the algorithmic efficiency ( normalized to the number of tracks with 3 pixel hits ) .",
    "for all event types considered in our htl studies the absolute track finding efficiency for tracks above @xmath20 is about 90% .",
    "the algorithmic efficiency is between 93% and 95% and the fraction of ghost tracks is typical between 5% and 8% .",
    "obviously the track parameters , fitted with 3 points only , are much inferior to the full tracker resolution .",
    "the reconstructed track s direction is good , the resolution in the @xmath21 direction being @xmath22 and in the @xmath23 direction @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath13 measurement however , is poor , mainly because of the small radius of the last hit ( 11  cm ) . for @xmath25 tracks this resolution is about 7% , but for @xmath26 it reaches 20% ( see ref.@xcite for more details ) .",
    "the curvature of the tracks is sufficient to distinguish the track sign with 100% efficiency up to @xmath13 of @xmath27 .",
    "the primary vertex candidates found during the track finding stage are reanalyzed . only pvs with at least 3 valid tracks",
    "are kept and the position of each vertex is estimated as the mean value of the z impact parameters of all tracks assigned to it .",
    "in addition to the main `` signal '' pv , on the average @xmath28 more pvs per event are found at high luminosity .",
    "the `` signal '' pv is usually found with a high accuracy of better than 50  @xmath29 m .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vtx ] where the difference in the z position of the reconstructed vertex and the monte carlo vertex is plotted .",
    "the efficiency of this algorithm is high , for the hlt event samples the `` signal '' pv is always found with an efficiency of better than 95% .",
    "this algorithm is similar to the one discussed in section  [ pix ] .",
    "since the algorithm is developed to trigger on exclusive b meson decays , selection criteria listed below are optimized for such decays .",
    "below we describe it in more detail .    1 .",
    "any pair of hits from two separate pixel layers are connected with a straight line in the transverse plane .",
    "we utilize the fact that the tracks we want to reconstruct are relatively stiff ( @xmath30 ) and the lever arm is small ( @xmath31 )",
    ". then the impact parameter ( ip , the distance from the line to the primary interaction point in the transverse plane ) is calculated .",
    "if it is less than @xmath32 , the two hits create a track candidate .",
    "2 .   extrapolating the straight line that connects two selected hits to the third ( strip ) layer in the @xmath33 plane ,",
    "the expected position ( @xmath34 ) of a third hit is calculated . if there is a reconstructed hit with its coordinate @xmath35 close to @xmath34 , @xmath36 , it is taken as the third hit of the track candidate .",
    "the momentum and the charge of the track is determined .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ipz ] we show the @xmath37 and @xmath38 distributions for decay ( [ eq : xs ] ) to illustrate the above cuts .",
    "if the transverse momentum of the reconstructed track is greater then @xmath39 it is accepted for further analysis .",
    "( right ) distributions for final state tracks of decay ( [ eq : xs]).,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   ( right ) distributions for final state tracks of decay ( [ eq : xs]).,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]",
    "the level 1 b physics trigger in cms is mainly based on the muon system ( the single muon trigger rate is assumed to be 10khz ) . at the level 2 information from the muon and calorimetric systems will be reanalyzed with fine granularity and more sophisticated algorithms .",
    "however , soft products of b decays usually do not manifest themselves in the calorimeters and more precise calculation of the trigger muon momentum can suppress the rate by only a factor of 2 .",
    "thus , one needs to apply further selection algorithms which are specific to b decays , e.g. reconstruction of b decay products ( tracks ) and calculation of invariant masses of intermediate resonances if any .",
    "the idea of using only 3 innermost hits at hlt to select the exclusive b decay modes is based on the observation that the momentum resolution provided by these 3 hits is only a few times worse than that obtained with the full tracker .",
    "[ fig : pt3 ] shows the transverse momentum resolution in percentage versus the number of continues hits used for track reconstruction .",
    "two distributions represent results for tracks of 1 and 10@xmath40 .",
    "one can see that for tracks with @xmath41 the transverse momentum resolution obtained with 3 hits is about 1.5% , 2 times worse than with the full tracker .",
    "the decay mode ( and its charge conjugate ) @xmath42 has been chosen as a benchmark .",
    "only the @xmath43 decay chain is triggered at this stage which allows us to select also the following decay modes of the b meson : @xmath44 where @xmath45 = @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .    applying the reconstruction algorithm discussed in section [ str ]",
    "we obtain the momentum and the charge for each reconstructed track . to trigger the decay modes ( [ eq : xs],[eq : mu ] ) we reconstruct all tracks with @xmath50 and then find all @xmath21 and @xmath43 candidates by trying different track combinations .",
    "an event is selected if two conditions are fulfilled .",
    "firstly , that there are two oppositely charged tracks close to each other ( @xmath51 ) , and their invariant mass ( assuming they are kaons ) is compatible with the @xmath21 mass , @xmath52 .",
    "secondly , there is a third track in the cone @xmath53 around the reconstructed @xmath21 candidate and the invariant mass of this @xmath21 candidate and the third track ( assuming it is a pion ) agrees with the @xmath43 mass , @xmath54 .",
    "mass cuts have been defined based on expected mass resolutions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] for the decay mode ( [ eq : xs ] ) : @xmath55 and @xmath56 .     and",
    "adjacent @xmath57 for the events of decay mode ( [ eq : xs]).,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   and adjacent @xmath57 for the events of decay mode ( [ eq : xs]).,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    the proposed algorithm reduces the single muon trigger rate by factor of 30 while providing a signal efficiency of about 75% .",
    "the fraction of ghost tracks is relatively small ( about 10% ) .",
    "further reduction of trigger rate will be based on more strict cuts using the full cms tracker capability to reconstruct exclusive b decays .",
    "the `` pixel '' @xmath1 trigger proposed here is an example of a tracker hlt application which uses only the pixel data . as signal events we used susy higgs bosons decaying into two @xmath1 leptons with two @xmath1 hadronic jet(s ) in the final state .",
    "the main background for such events are qcd 2-jet events in the @xmath13 range 50 - 230  gev / c .",
    "more details about the algorithm and the event samples used in the simulation can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "+ the hlt pixel algorithm is based on track isolation criteria and is schematically shown in fig  [ fig : three_cones ] .",
    "the @xmath1-jet direction is defined by the calorimeter trigger .",
    "all track candidates in the matching cone @xmath58 around the jet direction and above the @xmath59 cut are considered in the search for signal tracks , that is tracks which originate from the hadronic @xmath1 decay .",
    "the track with the highest @xmath13 is declared the `` leading '' track ( @xmath60 in fig .",
    "[ fig : three_cones ] ) .",
    "any other track which is in the narrow cone @xmath61 around @xmath60 is also assumed to come from the @xmath1 decay . a larger area @xmath62 is now searched for tracks above the @xmath63 cut .",
    "if no tracks are found in the @xmath62 cone , except the ones which are already in the @xmath61 cone , the isolation criteria is fulfilled and the jet is labeled as a @xmath1-jet . the narrow signal cone @xmath61 around the `` leading '' track @xmath60 is needed in order to trigger on 3 prong @xmath1 decays in addition to 1 prong .",
    "typical values of the cuts used above are : @xmath61=0.05 , @xmath58=0.10 , @xmath62=0.35 , @xmath64c and @xmath65 .",
    "the algorithm works very well at low luminosity . at high luminosity",
    ", however , it s efficiency becomes small ( about 50% ) due to the large number of tracks originating from the pile - up interactions .",
    "the efficiency is improved by using the pvs information .",
    "the vertex of the leading track is assumed to be the `` signal '' pv ( this assumption is correct for 99% of events ) . once the `` signal '' pv is defined only those tracks which were assigned to it are considered in the isolation criteria .",
    "this approach increases the efficiency of our algorithm at high luminosity to the same value as at low luminosity .",
    "the variation of the qcd 2-jet background and the higgs signal efficiency with the change of the isolation cone size is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lvl3_sig_bkg_eff ] for higgs mass of @xmath66 ( full squares ) and @xmath67 ( full circles ) and for two signal cone sizes @xmath61=0.05 and 0.10 .",
    "the points from left to right correspond to the following values of @xmath62 = 0.50 , 0.40 , 0.35 , 0.30 and 0.20 .",
    "one can see that a rejection factor of 5 ( for the 0.10 signal cone ) can be reached with an efficiency @xmath68 75% . a higher background rejection of 10 ( for the 0.05 signal cone ) can be achieved but at a price of the efficiency being dependent on the higgs mass .",
    "fast hlt algorithms for b physics decays and @xmath1-jets have been developed based on the cms pixel detector and the innermost strip layer .",
    "the key feature of these algorithms is track reconstruction based on 3 hits only .",
    "track parameters are calculated based on a simple helix approach .",
    "it is demonstrated that one can obtain high track reconstruction efficiency ( @xmath69 90% ) , very accurate primary vertex position in the @xmath16 dimension ( @xmath70 ) and a good momentum resolution ( 1%@xmath714% ) for tracks with @xmath72 .",
