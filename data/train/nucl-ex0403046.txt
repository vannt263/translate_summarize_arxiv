    "outgoing photons were detected by pair production in a 1  mm thick cylindrical lead converter and e@xmath71e@xmath72 tracking in cylindrical multi - wire and drift chambers .",
    "a 1.2  kg axial magnetic field was used for momentum analysis and concentric rings of segmented scintillators were used for fast triggering .",
    "the trigger scintillators comprised : an a - ring located inside the lead converter , a c - ring located between the lead converter and the tracking chambers , and a d - ring located outside the drift chamber . for more details on the rmc spectrometer",

    "@xcite .",
    "we employed a two  photon trigger that was based on the multiplicities and the topologies of the hits in the trigger scintillators and the drift chamber cells .",
    "the a - ring scintillators were used to reject events that had charged particles originating from the target region .",
    "the pattern of c and d - ring scintillators hits and drift cells hits were used to select events with topologies resembling the two @xmath73e@xmath72 pairs from two - photon events @xcite .    during a four week",
    "running period we recorded @xmath55 data from @xmath74 pion stops in liquid hydrogen .",
    "calibration data with a dedicated @xmath75 trigger were also collected .",
    "the signature of @xmath32 production in double radiative capture is a coincident @xmath63-@xmath63 pair with one mono - energetic gamma - ray and one nearly mono - energetic gamma - ray with an energy sum @xmath76 ( ignoring the @xmath32 recoil energy and the neutron - proton mass difference ) .",
    "the @xmath32 mechanism will compete with direct two - photon production from double radiative capture on pionic hydrogen .",
    "the later process yields a photon pair with individual energies @xmath77 , @xmath78 and summed energy @xmath79 that span that full @xmath55 three - body phase space .",
    "the branching ratio for double radiative capture on pionic hydrogen has been measured by tripathi _",

    "et al . _  yielded @xmath80 and the tree - level calculation by beder yielded @xmath81 , in fair agreement .",
    "the photon energy and angle distributions from experiment and theory are in good agreement .",
    "thus , together the small branching ratio of the direct two - photon process and distinctive kinematics of the @xmath32 mediated process are sufficient to separate these two sources of photon pairs .",
    "one source of two - photon background is real @xmath63@xmath63 coincidences from @xmath75 decay .",
    "the @xmath82 s were produced by pion charge exchange @xmath83 , both at - rest and in - flight .",

    "the much smaller contribution from in - flight charge exchange yields @xmath82 s with energies @xmath87  mev and photon pairs with opening angles @xmath88 .",
    "consequently the @xmath82 background overwhelms other two - photon signals at large opening angles .",
    "thus the direct two - photon process and the @xmath32 mediated process are only detectable at smaller angles .",
    "another source of background was accidental @xmath63@xmath63 coincidences arising from multiple @xmath89 stops .",

    "these accidental @xmath63-@xmath63 coincidences yield photon - pairs with opening angles @xmath90 and summed energies 106 - 258  mev .    in subsequent discussions we shall denote the real @xmath63-@xmath63 coincidences from @xmath82 decay the `` @xmath82 background '' , and the accidental @xmath63-@xmath63 coincidences from multiple pion stops the `` 2@xmath21 background '' .",
    "the data analysis was a three step process . in step one",

    "we applied cuts to reject the contributions from the @xmath82 background and the 2@xmath21 background and select the events from either double radiative capture or @xmath32 mediated capture . in step three",
    "we used the distinctive photon energy distributions of double radiative capture and @xmath32 mediated capture to search for evidence of the later process .    to identify photon pairs we applied both a tracking cut and a photon cut .",
    "the tracking cut imposed minimum values for the number of points in the drift chamber tracks , and maximum values for the chi  squared of the fits .",
    "the photon cut required that the electron - positron pairs intersect at the lead converter and that the reconstructed photon pairs originate from the hydrogen target .",
    "a total of @xmath91 photon pairs were found to survive these cuts .",
    "these events were dominated by the @xmath82 and 2@xmath21 backgrounds .    to reject the @xmath82 and 2@xmath21 backgrounds we applied a beam counter amplitude cut , a c - counter timing cut , and a two - photon opening angle cut .",
    "the beam counter amplitude cut rejected events with large energy deposition in the beam scintillators , thus indicating the arrival of multiple pions in one beam pulse . the c - counter timing cut rejected events with large time differences between the c - counter hits , thus indicating the two photons to have originated from two neighboring beam pulses .",
    "the opening angle cut eliminated events with @xmath92 , rejecting the background from @xmath75 decay .",

    "for @xmath100 we plot the distributions for both @xmath114  mev / c@xmath47 and @xmath115  mev / c@xmath47 . in the latter case the production gamma - ray and decay gamma - ray",

    "consequently , our sensitivity to @xmath32 production is dependent on the mass of the @xmath32 state .    in the maximum likelihood procedure we stepped the value of @xmath119 from @xmath45  mev / c@xmath47 to @xmath67  mev / c@xmath47 in increments of @xmath54  mev/@xmath0 and varied",
