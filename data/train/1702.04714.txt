    "can be written as a @xmath162 matrix in the momentum representation as @xmath163 the energy dispersion of @xmath164 is given by eq .  2 of the main text .",
    "from this dispersion , which provides the expression of the lower branch of the spectrum @xmath165 , we find that there exists a critical value @xmath48 above which the ground state is doubly degenerate and the energy minima shifts to finite momenta @xmath166 $ ] ( see fig.[disp ] ) .     and ( b ) @xmath167    the effective mass ( or the band mass ) of the bosons is thus given by @xmath168 .",
    "for @xmath169 , the expression of @xmath55 can be written as , @xmath170 we note that the effective masses @xmath171 in the two regimes @xmath172 both vanish at @xmath173 .",
    "furthermore , in the absence of disorder the superfluid fraction ( sff ) turns out to be the boson effective mass .",
    "thus @xmath55 captures the behavior of the sff obtained numerically as a function of @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "[ sff](a ) ) ; this situation is similar to that obtained in the continuum limit @xcite .    in presence of the aa potential we numerically diagonalize the single particle hamiltonian to obtain the ground state and the full excitation spectrum .",
    "the localization transition of the ground state is characterized by the vanishing of superfluid fraction ( sff ) which can be obtained using eq .  4 of the main text .",
    "alternatively , one can also adopt the perturbative approach to calculate the sff .",
    "to this end , we note that in the presence of a small phase twist @xmath174 across the boundary , the original hamiltonian becomes , @xmath175 an expansion of the @xmath176 ( eq .  [ ptwist ] ) to @xmath177 yields , @xmath178 where , @xmath179 is the unperturbed hamiltonian , @xmath180 is the kinetic energy operator and @xmath181 is the current operator .",
    "so , to @xmath182 the superfluid fraction is given by , @xmath183 where @xmath184 and @xmath150 stands for the lowest and @xmath150th eigenmode respectively . in fig .",
    "[ sff](b ) we have plotted @xmath185 using the above prescription ; we note that the sff vanishes at @xmath186 at which the ipr starts rising indicating the localization transition .",
    "the localization transition can also be qualitatively understood from the vanishing of the energy gap @xmath187 at the critical disorder strength @xmath188 .",
    "the energy gap ( @xmath187 ) between the ground state and the 1st excited state is expected to vanish at the localization transition point .",
    "using this fact , one can obtain a qualitative understanding of the phase diagram for both small and large @xmath0 .",
    "we note that for small @xmath189 at @xmath16 , the ground state is at @xmath66 and has an energy @xmath190 .",
    "now let us turn on @xmath12 which leads to a perturbation term , which can be written in momentum space as @xmath191 such a perturbation term leads to a hybridization of the ground state at @xmath66 with the one at @xmath192 which has energy @xmath193 .",
    "thus the simplest qualitative estimate of the transition line for small @xmath194 occurs when @xmath195 leading to @xmath196 we note that this reproduces the linear behavior of the phase boundary for small @xmath194 .",
    "a similar analysis can also be carried out at @xmath197 . here",
    "the ground state is again at @xmath66 for @xmath198 .",

    "the spinor part is chosen in such a way that up(down ) spin momentum distribution is peaked at @xmath229 and for @xmath66 it reduces to the usual form of the ground state for @xmath230 .",
