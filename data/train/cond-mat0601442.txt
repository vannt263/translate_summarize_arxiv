    "single electron tunneling in a superconductor is prohibited if the applied bias voltage is smaller than the superconducting gap .",
    "however , an electron in the spin - up band can be reflected as a hole in the spin - down band , a phenomenon called andreev reflection @xcite . a charge @xmath0 is transmitted in the superconductor at each andreev reflection , so that the conductance of a highly transparent normal metal / superconductor ( ns ) contact is doubled compared to the one of the corresponding nn contact .",
    "the equilibrium properties of the superconductor ( such as the value of the self - consistent superconducting gap ) are modified by a normal electrode connected to the superconductor , a phenomenon called the inverse proximity effect .",
    "it is expected that most of the inverse proximity effect takes place on a length @xmath1 if the area of the contact @xmath2 is much smaller than the superconducting coherence length @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the influence of the inverse proximity effect on transport properties can then be neglected , and a single channel , ballistic , one - dimensional model with a step - function variation of the superconducting gap captures the essential physics of localized interfaces , as shown by blonder , tinkham , and klapwijk ( btk ) @xcite . moreover , btk introduce a repulsive potential at the ns interface , characterized by the dimensionless parameter @xmath4 , being the strength of the repulsive potential normalized to the fermi energy .",
    "transparent interfaces correspond to @xmath5 and tunnel interfaces correspond to @xmath6 .",
    "disorder in the normal metal modifies strongly subgap transport at a single normal metal  / insulator / superconductor ( nis ) interface @xcite .",
    "the conductance can be enhanced by orders of magnitude by constructive interferences in which an electron can `` try '' the tunneling process a huge number of times @xcite .",
    "this effect due to scattering by disorder is already present in simple double barrier one - dimensional models .",
    "melsen and beenakker @xcite consider a ninis double junction in one dimension , with , in the btk language , barrier parameters @xmath7 ( for the nin interface ) and @xmath8 ( for the nis interface ) . the conductance , averaged over the fermi oscillations , shows a maximum for a value of @xmath7 comparable to @xmath8 as @xmath7 increases while @xmath9 is fixed @xcite .",
    "this enhancement of the conductance shows that the double barrier model captures multiple scattering as in a disordered system .",
    "we address here similar effects for non local transport in nisin junctions @xcite in which the normal electrode `` a '' is at potential @xmath10 , the electrode `` b '' is at potential @xmath11 , and the superconductor is at potential @xmath12 ( see fig .",

    "such devices have been realized in two recent experiments , performed in karlsruhe by beckmann _",
    "et al . _ with ferromagnets @xcite , and in delft by russo _ et al . _ with a nisin trilayer @xcite .",
    "a sizeable crossed signal is measured in the latter @xcite , which is surprising in view of lowest order perturbation theory in the tunnel amplitudes predicting an exact cancellation between the electron - electron and electron - hole channel crossed conductances @xcite .",
    "we take as a working hypothesis that non local transport with normal metals is described by higher order contributions in perturbation theory in the tunnel amplitudes .",

    "we deduce the first non vanishing term in the large-@xmath41 , large-@xmath4 expansion of the non local transmission : @xmath42 having a sign dominated by elastic cotunneling , in agreement with the green s function approach in which the first term in expansion of the non local transmission appears at order @xmath43 , where the large-@xmath4 normal transmission coefficient is proportional to @xmath44 @xcite .    in the case of highly transparent interfaces corresponding to @xmath5 , we find no crossed andreev reflection : @xmath45 , in agreement with the green s function approach in ref .",
