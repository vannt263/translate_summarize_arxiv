    "ionic liquids , molten salts and ionic solutions show a response to the application of an external electric field . in the case of small field",
    "amplitudes the response is typically modelled by linear constitutive relations , for example , the response manifested by a charge current is related to the local field by ohm s law and the charge density to the external field through the charge - charge correlation function @xcite .",
    "the response is characterized by different response functions ( or transport coefficients ) like the electric conductivity , electric permittivity and the charge - charge correlation .",
    "one can often find relations between the different response functions @xcite ; at least in some limits .",
    "a more famous one is the nernst - einstein equation that relates the diffusion coefficient to the electric conductivity @xcite , i.e. , particle flux to the charge current .",
    "this is a quite surprising relation as the particle flux is a single particle phenomenon whereas the charge current is a collective phenomenon .",
    "the nernst - einstein equation is then only valid when the ion cross - correlations can be neglected @xcite .",
    "one example where this assumption is not correct is where the flux of ion - pairs contributes to the mass flux , but not to the charge current as the charges cancels @xcite .",
    "the deviation can be determined from simulations or experiments and is often quantified by a deviation parameter @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "especially interesting is that harris et al .",
    "@xcite have expressed @xmath0 in terms of the velocity cross - correlation functions .",
    "importantly , the failure of the nernst - einstein equation means that the particle flux due to the electric field can not be modelled through ohm s law directly . rather than approaching this problem through the deviation parameter it is appealing to take one step back and propose a linear constitutive relation that involves a new response function relating the mass flux to the external field directly .",
    "this is done in this paper .",
    "the system s response is dependent on the wave length of the external field , and this can be modelled through wave vector dependent response functions @xcite . investigating the wave vector dependence is very relevant as the response can be very different on different length scales @xcite .",
    "also , this provide a way to probe a characteristic correlation lengths for a given system @xcite ; if the characteristic length scales are different for the different response functions this indicates that different underlying mechanisms are responsible for the system response .",
    "this is also addressed here .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section the theory for the response of an ionic system subjected to a static external field is presented . in sect .",
    "[ sec : iii ] molecular dynamics simulation results are presented and discussed , and , finally , in the last section conclusions from the work are drawn .",
    "we consider an ionic system composed of one cation and one anion specie .",
    "the ions are rigid meaning that any higher order induced effects and electron transfer mechanisms are ignored .",
    "the charges are @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath2 indicate either a cation or an anion , i.e. , @xmath3 or @xmath4 , then the number density @xmath5 follows the balance equation @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the diffusive flux and @xmath8 the advective flux .",
    "the production term @xmath9 accounts for additional forces that generate a local change in @xmath5 ; this includes application of an external electric field . the terms on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : balance ] ) can be expressed as the divergence of fluxes such that if one writes the production term as @xmath10 and @xmath11 we have for zero advection @xmath12 the system is kept away from equilibrium by application of a static spatially varying external electric field . the field points and varies in the direction parallel to the system @xmath13-direction ,",
    "i.e , the non - zero @xmath13-component of the external field reads @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the wave vector , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the system length in the @xmath13-direction .",
    "@xmath18 is either 0 or 1 .",
    "the experimental realization of this field is not straightforward .",
    "here it is considered as we are interested in the wave vector dependent response and as such this resembles the sinusoidal transverse and longitudinal force field methods , see for example , refs . . the corresponding electric potential is @xmath19 using @xmath20 .",
    "note , @xmath21 corresponds to a wave vector independent field amplitude and @xmath22 to wave vector independent potential amplitude .",
    "it is in place to discuss the maxwell equations .",
    "first , the induced / screening field is @xmath23 and according to gauss law @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the charge density given by the ionic density , @xmath26 is the electric permittivity of free space . from the maxwell - faraday equation @xmath27 , that is",
    ", the field due to the screeing does not induce any change in the magnetic field @xmath28 .",
    "then gauss law for the magnetic field is fulfilled , @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath30 and @xmath31 there are no net charge current ( ampere s circuital law ) .",
    "the system is therefore in a steady state .    to proceed one needs to relate the fluxes with the corresponding forces @xcite . for sufficiently small force amplitude this is done through the generalized linear response theory .",
    "consider the mass flux in the @xmath13-direction @xmath32 to depend on @xmath33 forces @xmath34 , @xmath35 then we have in the homogeneous situation @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the response function relating the flux @xmath32 to the force @xmath34 .",
    "assume that this response function can be separated into a spatial part and a temporal part .",
    "when we ignore time memory effects and by assuming isotropy the response functions can then be written as @xmath38 .",
    "the flux is @xmath39 the final expression is due to the fact that the system is static .",
    "this generalized response formalism can be applied to the present situation .",
    "the flux is proposed to be given by the two terms @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the diffusion response function ( or diffusion coefficient ) and @xmath43 is the response function that relates the particle flux to the external field .",
    "the symbol @xmath43 is a matter of choice .",
    "the first relation is just a generalized version of fick s law , but the second relation is not a generalization of ohm s law as @xmath43 relates the mass flux directly to external electric potential .",
    "also , the force in ohm s law is given by the local electric potential , i.e. , the sum of the screening potential and the external potential .",
    "the @xmath43-response function can be interpreted as the system response to an external field excluding the effects from diffusion .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : massflux ] ) is a generalized form of the nernst - planck equation @xcite .    in the steady state @xmath44 , and one has @xmath45 in fourier space by the convolution theorem for wave vector @xmath46 this reads @xmath47 or @xmath48 equation ( [ eq : fouriercomponets ] ) is the expression for the fourier coefficients for the number density . from this result",
    "one can also find the fourier coefficients for the charge density , @xmath25 .",
    "first , it is observed that due to symmetry the number density follows a sine series , i.e. , @xmath49 the fourier components of the charge density is then @xmath50 note , for small field strengths and negligible screening only the fundamental mode @xmath51 is excited and we have that @xmath52    in the following focus is on the case where the two ionic species , @xmath53 and @xmath4 , have same transport properties @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "( [ eq : fouriercharge ] ) reduces to @xmath56 from linear response theory @xcite the fourier components for the charge density is related to the charge - charge correlation function ( or charge - charge structure ) @xmath57 by @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "we then have an expression for @xmath60 in terms of the diffusion coefficient and the charge - charge structure @xmath61 the charge - charge structure is a collective property , and from eq .",
    "( [ eq : endeq ] ) one can see that @xmath62 relates this collective property to the single particle property governed by the diffusion coefficient .",
    "it is worth noting that in the debye - hckel regime , @xmath63 , the charge - charge structure is negligible , i.e. , @xmath64 .",
    "this corresponds to the limit of zero screening .",
    "equation ( [ eq : endeq ] ) then reads @xmath65 which is equivalent to the nernst - einstein equation @xcite and @xmath62 can in this limit be interpreted as the ionic electric conductivity .",
    "the charge density fourier components are in this limit @xmath66 , i.e. , they only dependent on amplitude of the external field . for systems where the diffusion coefficient is wave vector independent , @xmath67 ,",
    "the response function is @xmath68 this means that the wave vector dependent response in the presence of an external electric field is dominated by the screening effects .",
    "the response is evaluated for two simple models : ( i ) one model for molten salt proposed by hansen and mcdonald @xcite and ( ii ) one model for ionic liquid used by chapela et al .",
