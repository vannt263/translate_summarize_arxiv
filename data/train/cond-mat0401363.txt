    "there are a great number of situations in which a many agent system self organizes by coordinating all the individual actions .",
    "a similar situation is found in many particle , physical systems . the word  coordination \" that is used in a social or economic context is replaced by  ordering \" in the study of condensed systems .",
    "examples of self organization are for instance the growth of a crystalline structure or a transition leading to some specific magnetic phase .",
    "interesting situations arise in the case of systems in which the optimal configurations for different particles do collide with the each other .",
    "this is the case for instance in a spin glass in which many spins interact through a random interaction . in these cases",
    "the system is said to display some degree of _",
    "frustration_. a case of a multi - agent system displaying frustration that has been widely considered in the literature is the minority game ( mg ) @xcite . in this model",
    "many players have to make a binary choice and the winning option is the one made by the minority .",
    "frustration may in general arise as a consequence of the particular nature of the interactions between the particles as in a spin glass , by the boundary conditions imposed by the geometry or the system , or the rules to win the game as in the case of the mg .",
    "the similarities between the mg and spin glass systems has been discussed in great detail by ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the macroscopic signature of frustration is that the many agent system can not accommodate into a single , optimal state in which the energy is a minimum but relaxes instead to one of many , suboptimal configurations that correspond to local minima in the energy landscape .",
    "these configurations display what can be called _ quenched disorder _",
    "i.e. fail to display an ordered pattern and the associated fluctuations do not disappear at zero temperature . in a spin glass the orientation of all the spins do not reach a unique ordering . in the usual relaxation dynamic that is used to model the mg , each player continually modifies her choices and the final ordering of all the agents in terms of their respective choices is far from unique .",
    "the traditional mg ignores any possible spatial proximity among the players . in the present paper",
    "we place the agents in a lattice @xcite , @xcite thus associating a neighborhood to each player .",
    "we then let each player to make her decisions depending upon the options made by the players of her neighborhood .",
    "we next consider a random relaxation dynamics in which each player gradually adjusts her probability of choosing one given alternative of the binary choice .",
    "we call this model the local evolutionary minority game ( lemg )",
    ". this framework is particularly suitable to study the interplay between frustration and size effects as well as the emergence of ordered patterns through the relaxation process .",
    "it also allows a direct comparison with a many spin system in which the size of the neighborhood is assimilated to the range of the spin - spin interaction .    in this paper",
    "we present and discuss relevant results of numerical simulations of the lemg played in one- and two - dimensional systems .",
    "we investigate the influence of the value of the size parameter - or what is the same , the range of the interaction - in the emergence of ordered , optimal configurations .",
    "we analyze the case of a one dimensional system comparing the lemg with a model inspired in an antiferromagnetic spin system at a finite temperature . at the light of this comparison",
    "we show that the lemg can be regarded as a model in which disorder is gradually introduced , the control parameter being the range of the interaction .",
    "a fully disordered system that corresponds to the well known emg then appears to be a particular case in which the range of the interaction is the same as the size of the system . for any smaller value of the size parameter the system can be assimilated to an antiferromagnet .",
    "we use this to extend the model to include fluctuations like those produced by a finite temperature",
    ". this amounts to study the self organization process implied in the lemg including agents that change 1their decision with a finite probability .",
    "the comparison has the by - product of providing a physical picture to understand why a finite range in the interaction among the agents has the effect of producing a better coordinated configuration @xcite with a lower frustration .",
    "we first consider the traditional emg @xcite .",
    "this involves @xmath0 players that make one binary decision ( 0 or 1 ) .",
    "each player has a probability @xmath1 of choosing , say , 0 .",
    "each player receives one point if her decision places her in the minority and loses a point otherwise .",
    "we limit ourselves to consider the situation in which the amount of the loss is the same as the amount of the gain .",
    "the effect of relaxing this condition has been considered in @xcite .",
    "when her account of points falls below a given threshold , she changes @xmath2 with @xmath3 $ ] , at random , and @xmath4 .",
    "reflective boundary conditions are imposed at @xmath5 .",
    "all agents are assumed to update the corresponding @xmath6 s synchronically .",
    "it is customary to display the self - organization of the system through the probability density function @xmath7 obtained in a statistical ensemble of systems that are allowed to relax to equilibrium .",
    "this function gives the fraction of the population having a probability between @xmath8 and @xmath9 of choosing , say , 0 .",
    "when the probabilistic relaxation is used , the asymptotic function @xmath7 is shaped as a u with two symmetric peaks at @xmath10 and @xmath11 thus indicating that the @xmath0 agents have segregated into two parties making opposite decisions .",
    "the relaxation process corresponds to the minimization of an `` energy '' function @xmath12 @xcite where @xmath13 is the standard deviation of the distribution of groups of agents defined by :    ^2= _ a p(a ) ( a - n/2)^2 [ costo ] where @xmath14 is the probability distribution of groups of @xmath15 agents that have chosen , say , 0 . in @xcite",
    "it is proven that : = = n(<p>-1/2)^2 + ( < p>-<p^2 > ) .",
    "[ costo2 ]    one can thus see that the value of @xmath16 depends upon the properties of the above mentioned @xmath7 . at equilibrium @xmath16",
    "is an extensive magnitude proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "a minimization of @xmath17 is equivalent to find a distribution @xmath7 with the smallest possible number of losers as follows from the fact that @xmath18 where @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is the number of winners ( losers ) .",
    "if one assumes navely @xmath21 corresponding to a symmetric random walk ( and also eliminating the term @xmath22 in eq.([costo2 ] ) one gets @xmath23 while @xmath24 constant yields @xmath25 .",
    "a better result is obtained with the usual random relaxation dynamics for the emg yielding@xcite @xmath26 .",
    "energy and frustration remain linked to each other . for the emg we can define frustration as @xmath27 ; which fulfills @xmath28 .",
    "this definition may also be used for any system involving a game with multiple players .",
    "the value @xmath29 corresponds to a situation such as the `` majority game '' in which a player is a winner if her decision is the same as the majority .",
    "this leads to situations that can be assimilated to a ferromagnetic phase ( all the players ( spins ) have chosen the same option ( orientation ) ) . in the emg",
    "there are less winners than losers , and therefore @xmath30 .",
    "the lowest possible frustration for the emg is reached when the @xmath0 ( odd ) agents are coordinated to produce the largest possible minority , i.e. @xmath31 . thus the lowest possible frustration for a finite emg is @xmath32 .      within the lemg a set of neighborhoods @xmath33",
    "is constructed , one for each player .",
    "all neighborhoods have the same ( odd ) number @xmath34 of agents .",
    "we consider that the @xmath35 agent belongs to @xmath36 .",
    "we define a size parameter by @xmath37 .",
    "we define the set of neighborhoods assuming two possible spatial orderings that correspond respectively to a one - dimensional chain ( 1d ) or a square two - dimensional ( 2d ) regular grid , both with periodic boundary conditions ( i.e. corresponding respectively to a ring or a torus ) .",
    "when the agents are placed in a regular lattice the set @xmath33 can be generated as a sliding ( linear or square ) window of size @xmath34 .",
    "the rules of the lemg are the same as for the emg except for the important difference that an agent wins or loses points depending whether she is , or she is not , in the minority _ of her own neighborhood_. the @xmath38th agent pays no attention whatsoever to the agents that do not belong to @xmath39 .",
    "the lemg contains the emg as a particular case .",
    "in fact the lemg with @xmath40 ( or @xmath41 ) is an @xmath0-fold replica of the usual emg when @xmath36 coincides with the complete @xmath0-agent system . in the regular orderings in which the neighborhoods are respectively a segment or a square with an odd number of agents , the only agent that updates her @xmath6",
    "is located at the center of the square or segment .",
    "all agents are assumed to check their respective neighborhoods and update the corresponding values synchronically .    in spite of the fact that each player adjusts her decision according to her respective neighborhoods",
    ", we will be interested in computing the energy of the whole system , i.e. we want to check whether the choices made by each agent according to her respective neighborhoods lead the whole ensemble to a more efficient coordination scheme .",
    "notice that in principle there are no reasons to assume any kind of correlation between local and global optima : an agent may be a winner in her neighborhood and a loser when the entire system is considered and vice versa .",
    "the density distribution functions @xmath7 that are obtained with the lemg for 1d systems are shown in fig.[p(p ) ] .",
    "the results shown are an average over 200 samples , each one involving 5@xmath42 time steps .",
    "results for 2d systems are completely similar .",
    "the main noticeable difference of these functions with those obtained without the neighborhood structure is that they drop essentially to zero in an interval that is symmetric around @xmath43 .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]        a microscopic interpretation of the temperature parameter introduced in the preceding section is desirable .",
    "one possibility is to follow the line suggested in ref.@xcite .",
    "it has been shown there that the random relaxation used in the lemg gives rise to fluctuations that can be assimilated to the introduction of a temperature parameter .",
    "the fact that the individual probabilities @xmath45 are updated by choosing the new value at random from an interval @xmath46 $ ] with reflective boundary conditions at @xmath47 and @xmath48 produces fluctuations in the energy function @xmath17 given in eq.([costo2 ] ) .",
    "that way is however not acceptable .",
    "the introduction of a finite temperature into the lemg amounts to allow for `` hesitating agents '' that may change their current decision with a finite probability .",
    "the well known gradual updating rule of individual probabilities is unable to handle this situation . within the antiferromagnetic model for the lemg",
    ", such changes can easily be assimilated to a probabilistic flipping of spins in eq.([relax ] ) .",
    "this temperature parameter is therefore different from the one introduced in @xcite because both are associated to a different kind of fluctuations .    to deal with a finite temperature we proceed as usual , namely by assuming that a spin may flip with a probability that depends upon @xmath49 through : ( s_i -s_i)= [ termrelax ] that contains eq.([relax ] ) in the limit of @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the ordered pattern for the 1d system in which few string lengths are strongly preferred only holds in the low temperature limit .",
    "the fluctuations introduced through the probabilistic flipping of eq.([termrelax ] ) give rise to a thermal disorder that shows itself through the distribution function @xmath52 .",
    "this competes with the quenched disorder produced for large values of the size parameter . as expected , in the high temperature limit @xmath53 .    in fig.[termentornos]a",
    "we show how the ordered pattern of @xmath54 melts down as @xmath55 while for @xmath56 ( fig.[termentornos]b ) the exponential distribution does not change .",
    "the peak in @xmath52 for @xmath54 that represents an ordered pattern , gradually disappears , being replaced by an exponential for high @xmath57 .",
    "the quenched disorder that appears for @xmath56 is independent of @xmath57 .",
    "the local energy function given in eq.([eneloc ] ) is sensitive to the emergence of a local ordering .",
    "the relaxation indicated in eq.([termrelax ] ) allows to perform a minimization of @xmath58 while keeping control of the temperature .",
    "this allows to investigate the persistence of the local ordering and the competition between quenched and thermal disorder as the size of the neighborhood @xmath34 approaches the size @xmath0 of the whole system .    in fig.[terminimo ]",
    "we show the result of the minimization process for two different values of @xmath44 . as long as @xmath59",
    "the local energy is lowered as the relaxation proceeds , showing that a local ordering emerges .",
    "this reduction gradually becomes less important as @xmath60 and vanishes completely in that limit .",
    "this puts in evidence that when @xmath61 the relaxation process is unable to introduce any ordering into the system .",
    "= 513 ; the values of @xmath34 are show in the figure , width=340 ]    the energy function given in eq.([eneloc ] ) is expected to show some degree of structure as the size of the neighborhood changes .",
    "this is due to the frustration caused by the competing boundary conditions that arise from the concatenation of local minorities in neighborhoods that are comparable to the size of whole chain .",
    "such structure can clearly be seen in the plot of @xmath62 vs @xmath44 that is shown in fig.[enetorno ] .",
    "this pair of variables have been chosen because the corresponding curves turn out to be independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the structure that is displayed must therefore be considered to be independent of the size of the system .",
    "string lengths that are even fractions of @xmath0 minimize the frustration because they better fulfill periodic boundary conditions of the whole system by accommodating an even number of strings of equal length along the chain .",
    "one therefore expect that the average string length must be related to @xmath0 through @xmath63 etc . on the other hand for an alternating pattern of + 1 s and -1 s , the average string length must in turn related to the size of the neighborhood through @xmath64 , in order to achieve a minimal energy .",
    "an optimal ordering of the system is therefore possible for @xmath65 etc .",
    "these values are seen to correspond to minima of the curves in fig.[enetorno ] .",
    "the maxima in between correspond to a missmatch between the value of the size of the neighborhood and the size of the whole system , causing that such optimization can not be achieved .",
    "this structure is seen not to survive to thermal fluctuations .",
    ", for three different values of @xmath66 .",
    "empty ( full ) symbols correspond to @xmath0=2001 ( 513 ) agents.,width=340 ]",
    "the mg has been greatly used as a working model for self - organization .",
    "individual players , without any central coordination are nevertheless able to minimize a cost function that can be assimilated to an energy , by self- segregating into two different groups that make opposite elections .",
    "this features is neatly displayed by the density distribution of individual strategies that shapes as a u.    if the rules of the game are extended by placing the agents into the nodes of a regular or a random graph several important changes occur . in the first place",
    "the density distribution of individual strategies turns out to be insensitive to the neighborhood structure of the new model . in the second place",
    "a long range spatial ordering dominates the system . in the third place self - organization",
    "is improved by producing lower value of the energy function .",
    "these features can fruitfully be studied in 1d systems .",
    "we found that the distribution of strings of players that make similar options is a relevant parameter that provides a signature of the type and kind of order that is induced in the system .",
    "this distribution changes between a delta - like function in which strings of a few lengths are allowed to survive to an exponential distribution of string lengths that is a signature of randomness .",
    "this transition puts in evidence that the lemg provides a gradual interpolation between an ordered system in the limit of small neighborhoods and a fully disordered system when the size of the neighborhoods approaches de size of the system .",
    "we have shown that the lemg is equivalent to a spin system with an antiferromagnetic - like interaction that extends to a neighborhood whose size is taken as a control parameter .",
    "this model displays the same pattern of local ordering and string length distribution and also displays the same order - disorder transition when the range of the antiferromagnetic interaction approaches the size of the whole system .",
    "in addition an energy function can be introduced that can be considered as an extension of the lemg in which the neighborhood structure is explicitly accounted for .",
    "a minimum of such energy leads to a minimum of the energy function used for the lemg but the converse is not true .",
    "the distribution of string lengths can also be studied in the thermodynamic limit of an infinite linear system of spins in a thermal bath .",
    "the temperature parameter that has to be introduced is absent in the lemg and corresponds to hesitating agents that may change their decision with a finite probability at any time . using this model",
    "we were able to find the high and low temperature limits of the probability distribution of string lengths as arising from a minimization of a free energy .",
    "the low temperature limit , merges for small neighborhoods into the one derived from the usual relaxation dynamics of the lemg or the antiferromagnetic model yielding a delta - like distribution of lengths in which only very few privileged lengths survive and a long range ordered pattern emerges .",
    "the high temperature limit can only be treated within the antiferromagnetic model . within this framework an order - disorder transition can be predicted . thermal randomness associated to the high temperature limit",
    "has the same exponential distribution of string lengths that is numerically obtained in the quenched disordered limit for zero temperature .",
    "we have also studied the effect of the interplay of the size of the system and the size of the neighborhood .",
    "we have shown that the energy of the spin system as a function of the size parameter can be cast into a form that is independent of the size of the system .",
    "this function that is highly structured puts in evidence the occurrence of `` preferred '' and `` hampered '' values of the size parameter that correspond to minima and maxima of the frustration introduced by conflicting boundary conditions .",
    "the 1d system that we have considered in the present paper allows to get a detailed physical picture of the lemg .",
    "it helps to understand how a structure of neighborhoods makes it possible a better ordering of the system that is in turn reflected as a minimum of the energy .",
    "such ordered phase that is equivalent to an antiferromagnetic ordering shows up as a better coordination of the decisions made by decentralized agents in a minority game .",
