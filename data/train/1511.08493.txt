    "brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) are the largest galaxies in the universe , and as such they are likely to have evolved from the most complex and extended hierarchical - merger trees during the most rapid stage of galaxy assembly .",
    "their growth is still ongoing today as they accrete smaller galaxies within their host clusters .",
    "bcgs also host the richest populations of globular clusters ( gcs ) , a mark of exceptionally intense star formation under conditions of high gas density at high redshift .",
    "the nearest examples of these high - specific - frequency globular cluster systems ( gcss ) include those within m87 in virgo @xcite , ngc 1399 in fornax @xcite , and ngc 3311 in hydra @xcite .",
    "these cases are , however , eclipsed by the still more luminous giants that can be found by searching further outward .",
    "a well known example is ngc 4874 in coma @xcite , which may hold @xmath7 gcs of its own , and a still richer system may lie within abell 1689 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a rich galaxy cluster may also contain an extended intra - cluster medium ( icm ) of stellar light and high - temperature x - ray gas , and the icm itself can hold large numbers of intragalactic globular clusters ( igcs ) that may even exceed the total in the central bcg ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the igcs may in turn be a combination of objects stripped from other galaxies in the cluster , and ones in the cd halo of the central bcg .",
    "in short , these systems offer a testing ground of unequalled richness for exploring gc systematics observationally .    incorporating gcs fully into hierarchical galaxy formation models",
    "is difficult because spatial resolutions less than @xmath8 pc are needed to trace star cluster formation , while the galaxy as a whole needs a scale six orders of magnitude larger .",
    "but appropriately designed models have had some initial success at reproducing the observed gc mass distribution , and perhaps more challengingly , the metallicity distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the existing models , though still quite preliminary , already hint that the gc metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) changes significantly with host galaxy mass even among large galaxies .",

    "in paper i @xcite , we introduced a new hst - based imaging survey of seven bcgs , aimed primarily at studying the gcss in these biggest of all galaxies .",
    "paper i contained a discussion of the luminosity and mass distribution function of their gc populations . in the current paper , we present more detailed results for the nearest of these seven systems , ngc 6166 , including the gcs spatial distribution and total population , and the distribution of gcs by color and metallicity . similar material for the remaining six galaxies will be presented in the next paper of our series .    for ngc 6166",

    "we present the first comprehensive two - color photometric study of the ngc 6166 system .",
    "the basic design of the program is set out in paper i. for ngc 6166 , the acs / wfc camera was nearly centered on the target galaxy , while the wfc3 camera was used in parallel to obtain an additional field in the outskirts of the host cluster a2199 .",
    "total exposure times for acs / wfc were 5370 sec ( f475w ) and 4885 sec ( f814w ) , while for wfc3 they were 5460 sec ( f475w ) and 4555 sec ( f814w ) .",

    "the psfs were empirically generated from bright , uncrowded starlike objects distributed across the target fields .",
    "for the acs fields , 95 stars in @xmath32 and 87 stars in @xmath33 were summed to generate the psfs , while for wfc3 42 stars in @xmath32 and 39 stars in @xmath33 were used .",
    "the psf shape was set to be quadratically variable in position @xmath34 , though comparisons with the uniform - psf option showed negligible differences in the resulting photometry .",
    "the psf - fitted magnitudes were corrected to large - aperture magnitudes ( @xmath35 ) with aperture photometry of bright isolated stars , and lastly corrected to total magnitudes with the enclosed - energy curves published in the acs / wfc and wfc3 handbooks .",

    "analysis of their light profiles ( see b15 ) indicates that these companions are relatively undistorted and thus not physically connected with the central bcg .    .",

    "this issue is not of major importance for galaxies in which both gcs and halo light have small ellipticities .",

    "but the metal - rich and metal - poor modes both have larger dispersions in ngc 6166 than in other systems , making the two modes overlap significantly and filling the usually - sparse intermediate - metallicity zone .",
    "both these features are reminiscent of the recent @xcite models in which gc formation is driven at every stage by halo mergers . with ngc 6166 , we may be seeing the results of a hierarchical formation process so extended and complex that the simplistic bimodal , two - phase scenario is no longer an effective picture of its history .",
    "this regime of extreme galaxy mass and environmental richness is essentially populated only by bcgs .",
    "3 .   the gcs shows a strong global metallicity gradient , but this results almost entirely from the decreasing ratio of mr to mp clusters with increasing radius .",
    "the mean metallicity of each mode changes little with radius .",
    "the radial profile of the @xmath264band _ halo light _ matches the _ metal - rich _ gcs extremely well for all radii @xmath45 ( 12 kpc ) , falling roughly as @xmath277 in surface intensity ( @xmath200 ) or gc number density ( @xmath278 ) .",
    "by contrast , the metal - poor gcs follow a much shallower profile as @xmath279 , more nearly matching an isothermal dark - matter halo .",
    "the red , metal - rich gcs lie in an elliptical spatial distribution that also matches the shape of the halo light .",
