    "essentially , coherence is lost because the product of a large number of factors ranging between 0 and 1 tends to 0 .",
    "the process is speeded up if at least one mode contributes a factor close to 0 .",
    "this corresponds to a vanishing spatial overlap caused by differing gradients in the potential energy surfaces .",

    "while the fast modes alone maintain electronic coherence , the slow mode is mainly responsible for the overall loss of coherence .",
    "the rate of the decoherence , and the suppression of recurrence , is attributed to the dephasing of the oscillations along single modes . even in @xmath36 with only three degrees of freedom , the loss of coherence is thus seen to be a multi - modal effect with a strong participation of the slower bending motion .",

    "initially , the system is prepared in an equally weighted superposition of the two cationic states ,    @xmath46    the high number of degrees of freedom restricts us to one time - dependent single particle function ( spf ) per degree of freedom and state , which is however fully flexible and expanded in a harmonic dvr grid @xcite . for selected states ,",

    "recurrence is observed after the associated oscillation period . the overall coherence , as outlined in sec .",
    "[ sect : adiabatic - model ] , can be described as the product of the one - dimensional coherences , if mode - mode couplings are neglected . due to the dephasing of the oscillations along the different normal modes , the overall coherence drops to zero and",
    "does not recur .",

    "[ fig : paraxylene - speed ] , we study the influence of various selected modes on the decoherence .",
    "the ten fastest normal modes correspond to c - h vibrations .",
    "electronic coherence is maintained if only this subset of modes is considered .",
    "the 34 slowest modes , with their relatively long recurrence times , lead instead to rapid loss of coherence .",
    "it is thus not the speed of the nuclear motion that defines the influence on electronic decoherence , but rather the topology of the potential energy surfaces relative to each other , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : topology - sketch ] .",
    "note that , within our adiabatic model , the decoherence rate is independent of the weights assigned to the initial states , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : paraxylene - weights ] .    in a typical mctdh calculation ,",
    "the results are taken to be converged if the population of the highest spf is below @xmath50 , or if the effect of leaving the highest spf out is below @xmath51 ( see ref .",
    "this level of accuracy is certainly not feasible with a large number of degrees of freedom .",
    "however , we can approximate by the following reasoning : there are many pairs of vibrational modes without discernible mode - mode coupling . along these modes ,",
    "the nuclear wave packet is very well described using only one spf .",
    "more spfs are needed to capture the dynamics with respect to coupled modes .",
    "the one - dimensional calculations are of course exact with one spf per surface .    figure [ fig : paraxylene - spf ] shows the effect of including a second spf for a subset of twelve coupled modes @xmath52 .",
    "the results are comparable to the ones obtained by using only one spf per mode .",
    "it is noticeable that the recurrence at @xmath53{fs}$ ] is suppressed if two spf are used in this group of modes and that decoherence becomes slightly faster .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , electron dynamics following photoionization was studied in paraxylene .",
    "decoherence was attributed to the width of the nuclear wave packet , because the energy gap and hence the frequency of @xmath54 changes over its extension . after averaging over all nuclear coordinates",
    ", coherence is lost without recurrence , in the case of paraxylene with a half - life time of @xmath55{fs}$ ] .",
    "this approach does not allow for transfer of density between the different nuclear geometries within the wave packet and decoherence becomes a consequence of dephasing by averaging the coherent matrix elements over many different geometries .",
    "it follows from eq .   if the kinetic energy operator is neglected and the nuclear wavepacket is replaced by a geometry distribution @xmath56 .",
    "note that non - adiabatic effects are thereby excluded .",
    "although this model provides a physically reasonable time scale for decoherence in multidimensional systems , it is unclear when and how the approximation breaks down and how to systematically improve it .",
    "in contrast , in the model proposed here , the whole nuclear wave packet evolves fully quantum - mechanically and the treatment of decoherence , and potentially of time - resolved electronic spetroscopies , becomes exact at short times . by comparing , within our model , the decoherence rate with and without including kinetic energy , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : paraxylene - kinetic ] , we find that neglecting the kinetic energy operator in the quantum - dynamical calculation slightly overestimates electronic decoherence and misses the persisting linear component seen in the long - term behavior .",
    "{ fs}$ ] . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : phenylalanine - trace - squared ] , we show the evolution of electronic coherence in phenylalanine , which was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite for an initial state arising from the photoionization cross - sections . in our analysis , initially , the cation ground state and the first excited state are in a coherent superposition .",
    "again , we use one spf per surface and mode , and we compare one - dimensional simulations to the propagation including all 63 degrees of freedom . most mode - mode couplings have a value @xmath57 .",
    "we find that the initially pure state evolves to a mixed state within about @xmath35{fs}$ ] , if all modes are considered .",
    "recurrence is suppressed , as the oscillations dephase along the different modes .",
    "while most modes preserve electronic coherence over the period of investigation , we observe a stronger participation of relatively slow vibrational modes with ground - state frequencies of @xmath58{cm^{-1 } } , \\unit[1809]{cm^{-1}}$ ] , and @xmath59{cm^{-1 } } $ ] , respectively .",
    "it is often assumed that , if nuclear motion plays a role in electronic decoherence , it is the fast modes that should be considered @xcite . in an organic molecule , these are the c - h vibrations with a typical frequency of about @xmath60{cm^{-1}}$ ] , corresponding to a period of vibration of @xmath61{fs}$ ] .",
    "this is typically slower than calculated charge migration times and is therefore not considered to have an effect .",
    "our study , however , indicates that it is not the fast , but the interplay of the slow modes ( in the sense of their inverse vibrational frequencies in the neutral ground state ) that causes decoherence on a femtosecond timescale . in fig .",
    "[ fig : paraxylene - speed ] , we show that , in paraxylene , if only the 10 c - h vibrations are considered , the system stays coherent within at least @xmath62{fs}$ ] .",
    "this is because the potential energy surfaces for the fast modes turn out to be only vertically displaced from each other .",
    "as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : topology - sketch ] and discussed in sec .",
    "[ sect : electronic - decoherence ] , in this case , the nuclear wave packets move synchronously on the potential energy surfaces , and their spatial overlap does not change much . in the slower modes , the potential energy surfaces can also be horizontally displaced from each other , and the spatial overlap is reduced .",
    "we presented an _ ab - initio _",
    "model for electronic decoherence following photoionization that takes the quantum nature of the nuclei into account and allows for a full - dimensional treatment of the molecule . combined with a proper treatment of the preparation step and with the consideration of the relevant electronic observables",
    "it can be used to interpret and predict the outcome of current experiments in molecular attoscience @xcite .",
    "the probe step can be excluded from the analysis , as the loss of electronic coherence would be apparent in any probe technique sensitive to electronic structure .",
    "we showed that electronic decoherence can be explained by considering the topologies of different potential energy surfaces .",
    "it is the interplay of a large number of vibrational modes that are causing decoherence in the electronic density matrix , not a set of e.g. fast c - h vibrations .",
    "our results suggest that in molecular systems , purely electronic dynamics that may be described in terms of a coherent electronic wave packet , exists only for sub - femtosecond time scales , and nuclear motion can not be neglected . with the approach shown in this paper",
    ", one can calculate the time - dependent density matrix of the electronic subsystem and from it the time - dependent expectation values of any observable that depends only on the electronic subsystem via @xmath63 for example the hole density .",
    "observables of the form @xmath64 that depend on the electronic states and the nuclear geometry can be easily computed as well since the full nuclear wave packets are available .",
    "the model is currently limited to short time scales . in the future , we plan to explore quantum - classical approaches that allow us to propagate the nuclei for longer times . however",
    ", we note that for describing the short - time electronic response with nuclear - induced decoherence , this model ( with possible non - adiabatic extensions ) is all what is required , as decoherence sets in before the nuclear wave packets abandon the quadratically expanded region of the potential energy surfaces .",
    "the exact quantum - mechanical calculations will serve as a reference for future development of these methods .",
