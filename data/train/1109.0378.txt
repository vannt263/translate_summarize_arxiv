    "the nuclear spectroscopic telescope array ( nustar ) mission@xcite is a nasa small explorer that will carry the first focusing hard x - ray ( @xmath0  kev ) telescopes to orbit .",
    "it is scheduled to be launched into low earth orbit ( 550  km altitude , 6  deg inclination ) by a pegasus xl rocket from kwajalein atoll in february 2012 .",
    "nustar has two co - aligned telescopes , each consisting of a depth - graded multilayer optic@xcite focusing onto a cadmium zinc telluride ( cdznte ) pixel detector@xcite .",
    "the detector is placed at the bottom of a cylindrical active csi anti - coincidence shield to reduce detector background .",
    "cadmium zinc telluride ( cdznte ) and cadmium telluride ( cdte ) semiconductor materials are attractive for use in astronomical hard x - ray instruments because , compared to alkali - halide scintillators , they can achieve superior spectral resolution and imaging detectors can be implemented in compact geometries .",
    "these materials also have relatively high atomic number ( 48 for cd and 52 for te ) and a wide enough band gap ( @xmath7  ev ) to permit near room temperature operation .",
    "because of these advantages , cosmic hard x - ray detectors using cdznte and cdte are already operating in space onboard the swift@xcite and integral satellites , respectively .",
    "both missions contain coded aperture instruments with a large number of single planar detectors ( 32,768 cdznte for swift , 16,384 cdte for integral ) . due to the planar architecture , and the resulting relatively high capacitance and leakage current , and charge collection non - uniformity , the spectral resolution of these coded mask imagers",
    "is limited .",
    "nustar will be the first astronomical mission to utilize cdznte hybrid pixel detectors , where the detector anode is divided into small segments , and low electronic noise , small leakage and good spectral resolution ( @xmath81  kev fwhm from @xmath0  kev ) is achievable .",
    "exploiting the good energy resolution for spectroscopy of astrophysical sources requires constructing a highly - accurate response model . for both cdznte and cdte",
    ", the low hole mobility leads to a non - gaussian energy response , in particular spectral tailing. as a result , determining the resolution kernel requires a detailed charge transport model , combined with monte carlo simulations .",
    "in addition , in the case of cdznte , current high - pressure bridgman material growth processes produce crystals with a nonuniform distribution of charge transport properties .",
    "this results in variation of the charge transport properties across a centimeter - scale detector .",
    "we must therefore measure these properties for each pixel in order to construct a nustar detector response model that can meet requirements for spectral reconstruction .    in this paper",
    ", we describe the nustar spectral calibration program , the charge transport model , and we present results obtained by fitting data from nustar flight detectors .",
    "each nustar focal plane consists of four cdznte hybrid pixel detectors arranged in a @xmath9 array ( see figure  4 in [ ] ) .",
    "the sensor element in each hybrid is a cdznte crystal with a segmented anode .",
    "each anode pixel is attached to the input pad of a custom readout circuit using a gold - wire / conductive epoxy interconnect .",
    "the low - noise asic ( nucit @xcite ) , was developed by caltech originally for the _ heft _ balloon program@xcite , and upgraded for homeland security and again for _ nustar_. the cdznte crystals were manufactured by endicott interconnects ( formerly ev products ) .",
    "each crystal has an active collecting area of 2 cm @xmath1 2 cm and a thickness of 2 mm .",
    "the cathode electrode is a monolithic platinum contact and the anode electrode is patterned into a @xmath10 grid with each pixel having pitch of 605  @xmath3 m , forming 1024 pixels for each hybrid .",
    "the pixel contacts are separated by a 50  @xmath3 m gap .",
    "the nucit asic contains a common on - chip analog - to - digital converter and an external microprocessor supports the readout .",
    "each of the 1024 ( a 32 x 32 array matched in pitch to the sensor ) readout circuits has its own preamplifier , shaping amplifier , discriminator , sample and hold circuitry and test pulsar .",
    "the nucit asic preamplifier and readout are designed so that both an electron signal and a hole signal can be determined for each event , allowing a depth of interaction measurement . to obtain pulse height information ,",
    "the output of each pixel s preamplifier is presented as a current signal sequentially and continuously to a bank of 16 sampling capacitors , with a @xmath11  ns ( programmable ) dwell time on each capacitor .",
    "the signal is also presented as a voltage to a discriminator .",
    "when a trigger occurs , sampling is halted . at this point",
    "the capacitor bank contains approximately eight samples `` pre - trigger '' and eight `` post - trigger '' .",
    "the integrated charge signal is obtained by subtracting the pre - trigger samples from the post - trigger samples . in normal operation , the instrument control processor searches all triggered pixels for the highest pulse height and reads nine sets of sixteen pulse height samples from a @xmath12 array .",
    "the processor packs the charge signal , obtained by performing the subtraction described above , into an array containing the pixel with the highest signal at the center , and the 8 surrounding pixels . in subsequent ground processing , based on a threshold determined in software ,",
    "the surrounding pixels are sorted into electron ( positive amplitude ) and hole ( negative amplitude ) signals , and each group is summed .",
    "the negative amplitude hole signal results from the trapped holes creating image charge on the anode pixels ( the holes are trapped for a timescale longer than the readout time ) . in order to cancel common mode noise , the average of the hole signal is subtracted from the electron signal .",
    "figure  [ fig : specco57 ] shows a typical cdznte spectrum obtained with a @xmath4co radioactive source .",
    "the spectrum contains events where only the central pixel is triggered ( _ ie . _",
    "excluding events where charge is shared among multiple pixels ) .",
    "the energy resolution at 14.4 and 122  kev is 0.5  and 0.9  kev fwhm respectively .",
    "this resolution is much better than that achieved with a monolithic cdznte detector ( 7  kev at 122  kev for swift@xcite , 9  kev at 100  kev for integral ) due to the small pixel effect@xcite and the ability to remove pixel - to - pixel charge collection variation .",
    "the test pulse , which appears at about 147  kev in the spectrum , has a width of 0.4  kev fwhm , showing the nucit asic and leakage current noise is very low . a low - energy tail associated with the 122  kev main peak is also seen in figure  [ fig : specco57 ] .",
    "the tail structure is produced by a combination of hole trapping and compton down - scattering of the line @xmath13-rays in the radioactive source holder and passive material surrounding the detector .",
    "figure  [ fig : dplotco57 ] shows a scatter plot of the center pixel energy ( electron signal ) vs the average energy of the 8 surrounding pixels ( hole image signal ) for single pixel events .",
    "the events produced by 122 kev gamma - rays are largely distributed in a line tilted at an angle relative to the y - axis . at large values of hole signal ,",
    "the event track curves back towards the origin .",
    "the location of an event on this track depends on interaction depth and the charge transport properties of the pixel .",
    "the central pixel pulse height decreases with interaction depth as a result of the variation in the magnitude of the image charge signal with depth .",
    "the closer to the anode the event occurs , the greater the image charge , and this image charge is both detected on the surrounding pixels , and subtracts from the central pulse height .",
    "low - energy photons ( @xmath14  kev ) interact only in a shallow region near the cathode surface and are observed to produce very little hole signal .",
    "however , the 122 kev photons in figure  [ fig : specco57 ] occur at a range of depths in the cdznte , and so produce the `` depth curve '' . when collapsed onto the x - axis to produce a standard spectrum , this",
    "is observed as a low - energy tail to the line .",
    "an advantage of the depth measurement is that the cdznte activation background induced by cosmic radiation can be suppressed by flagging and rejecting events with large interaction depths .",
    "as noted above , photons with energy @xmath15  kev that enter through the aperture interact on average near the cathode surface , while the activation background occurs uniformly in the cdznte crystal .",
    "we can then flag and reject events that occur deep in the detector as background events .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "we have developed a monte - carlo simulation code for the nustar cdznte pixel detectors that generates a spectral model as a function of incident energy . by comparing simulated models to observed data , we succeed in extracting mobility - lifetime products for electrons and holes independently for all @xmath10 cdznte pixels .",
    "we found a correlation ( r = 0.72 ) between the obtained mobility - lifetime products for electrons and holes as a function of pixel .",
    "the spectral response model we have developed for each individual pixel can accurately reproduce calibration data taken on the flight detectors in the laboratory .        , f.  a. , boggs , s. , christensen , f. , craig , w. , hailey , c. , stern , d. , zhang , w. , et  al . , `` the nuclear spectroscopic telescope array ( nustar ) , '' in [ _ society of photo - optical instrumentation engineers ( spie ) conference series _ ] , _ society of photo - optical instrumentation engineers ( spie ) conference series _ * 7732 * ( july 2010 ) .    ,",
