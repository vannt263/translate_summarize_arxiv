    "a small fraction of sun - like stars have giant planets with orbital periods smaller than about 10 days ( marcy et al .",
    "2005 , udry & santos 2007 ) .",
    "the existence of these planets was a surprise , because it was expected that giant planets would only be found beyond the `` snow line , '' with orbital distances greater than a few astronomical units .",
    "other surprises have come from detailed studies of individual objects .",
    "some are found on highly eccentric orbits ( johnson et al .",
    "2006 , bakos et al .  2007 , maness et al .  2007 ,",
    "johns - krull et al .",
    "some have mean densities that are quite small ( knutson et al .",
    "2007 , mandushev et al .  2007 ) or large ( sato et al .  2005 , torres et al .",
    "2007 ) in comparison with jupiter .",
    "however , in at least one sense , the close - in giant planets have fulfilled prior expectations : they orbit their host stars in the prograde direction , relative to the sense of the stellar rotation .",
    "this is true , at least , of the 6 systems for which measurements of spin - orbit alignment have been reported ( queloz et al .",
    "2000 ; wolf et al .  2007 ;",
    "narita et al .  2007a ,",
    "b ; loeillet et al .",
    "2007 ; winn et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 , 2007a ) . in all of these cases but one ,",
    "the sky projections of the orbital axis and the stellar rotation axis are observed to be fairly well - aligned , with measurement precisions ranging from about 1.5 to 30 deg .",
    "the exception is hd  17156 , for which the angle between those axes was found to be @xmath1  deg ( narita et al .",
    "2007b ) . in all of these cases",
    ", the measurement technique relies upon the rossiter - mclaughlin ( rm ) effect , the anomalous doppler shift that occurs during transits due to stellar rotation ( see , e.g. , queloz et al .",
    "2000 , ohta et al .  2005 , gimnez 2006 , gaudi & winn 2007 , winn 2007 ) .",
    "a close alignment between the orbital and rotational axes seems natural because this pattern prevails in the solar system , and because the angular momenta of the parent star and the planetary orbits presumably derive from the same protostellar disk .",
    "however , some theories of planetary migration  proposed to explain how giant planets attain short - period orbits  predict occasionally large misalignments ( chatterjee et al .",
    "2007 , fabrycky & tremaine 2007 , wu et al .",
    "2007 , nagasawa et al .  2008 ) .",
    "these theories , as well as the general history of surprises in this field , provide motivation to continue measuring exoplanetary spin - orbit alignment .    in this paper",
    ", we present a measurement of the rm effect for the transiting exoplanetary system tres-2 .",
    "this system was discovered by odonovan et al .",
    "it consists of a planet with a mass of @xmath2  @xmath3 and radius @xmath2  @xmath4 orbiting a g0v star with a period of 2.5  d ( odonovan et al .",
    "2006 , holman et al .",
    "2007 , sozzetti et al .  2007 ) .",
    "it did not stand out as a promising rm target because the star is relatively faint ( @xmath5 ) and is a slow rotator ( @xmath6  km  s@xmath7 ; odonovan et al .",
    "2006 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the transit occurs at a high impact parameter across the stellar disk ( @xmath8 ; holman et al .",
    "2007 ) , a favorable circumstance for this type of measurement ( gaudi & winn 2007 ) . furthermore , in our continuing effort to measure the spin - orbit angles for a statistically meaningful number of systems , we do not want to ignore stars with small sky - projected rotation rates .",
    "this is because a small value of @xmath9 might be caused by a small value of @xmath10 , i.e. , there might be a large spin - orbit misalignment . for these reasons , we pursued tres-2 .",
    "we describe the new data in   2 , the model that we used to interpret the data in   3 , and the results in   4 .",
    "we observed a transit of tres-2 on ut  2007  april  26 with the keck  i 10 m telescope and the high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires ; vogt et al .",
    "we set up the instrument in the same manner that has been used consistently for the california - carnegie planet search ( butler et al .",
    "1996 , 2006 ) .",
    "in particular we employed the red cross - disperser and used the i@xmath11 absorption cell to calibrate the instrumental response and the wavelength scale .",
    "the slit width was @xmath12 and the typical exposure time was 3 - 4  min , giving a resolution of about 70,000 and a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of approximately 200  pixel@xmath7 .",
    "we observed the star for 4  hr bracketing the predicted transit midpoint and obtained a total of 56 spectra , of which 30 were taken during the transit .",
    "we also obtained two iodine - free spectra , with a higher snr and higher resolution .",
    "we used the sum of these spectra as a template for the doppler analysis , which was performed with the algorithm of butler et al .",
    "we estimated the measurement error in the doppler shift derived from a given spectrum based on the scatter among the solutions for individual 2    sections of the spectrum .",
    "the typical error was 6  m  s@xmath7 .",
    "the data are given in table  1 and plotted in figs .  1 and 2 . also shown in those figures",
    "are data obtained previously by odonovan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , consisting of 11 velocities measured with keck / hires using a different setup , as well as the photometric data of holman et al .",
    "to determine the projected spin - orbit angle and its uncertainty , we simultaneously fitted a parametric model to the radial - velocity data as well as the photometric data of holman et al .",
    "we included the photometric data as a convenient way to account for the uncertainties in the photometric parameters and their covariances with the spin - orbit parameters , although in practice the photometric uncertainties were irrelevant for this system .",
    "the model is based on a circular orbit of a star and planet .",
    "the photometric transit model was identical to the model used by holman et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . to calculate the anomalous doppler shift as a function of the positions of the planet and star",
    ", we used the technique of winn et al .",
    "( 2005 ) : we simulated in - transit spectra , and determined the doppler shifts using the same algorithm used on the actual data .",
    "the simulations rely on a template spectrum ( described below ) that is meant to mimic the emergent spectrum from a small portion of the photosphere . at a given moment of the transit ,",
    "we denote by @xmath13 the fractional loss of stellar flux , and we denote by @xmath14 the line - of - sight velocity of the occulted portion of the stellar disk . to represent the occulted portion of the stellar spectrum , we scaled the template spectrum in flux by @xmath13 and shifted it in velocity by @xmath14 .",
    "we subtracted the scaled and shifted spectrum from a rotationally - broadened template spectrum and then `` measured '' the anomalous doppler shift @xmath15 .",
    "this was repeated for a grid of @xmath16 , and a polynomial function was fitted to the resulting grid .",
    "we used this polynomial to calculate the anomalous doppler shift @xmath15 as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which are themselves functions of time .",
    "differential rotation was ignored , as its effects are expected to be negligible ( gaudi & winn 2007 ) .    the template spectrum should be similar to that of tres-2 but with slightly narrower lines because of the lack of rotational broadening .",
    "we experimented with two different empirical templates based on observations of similar stars ,  k , @xmath17 , [ fe / h ]  =  @xmath18 , @xmath19  km  s@xmath7 ) and hd  66428 ( @xmath20  k , @xmath21 , [ fe / h ]  =  @xmath22 , @xmath23  km  s@xmath7 ) .",
    "the stellar parameters are from the spocs catalog ( valenti & fischer 2005 ) . ] finding that both templates gave results consistent with the function @xmath24 .",
    "this function is consistent with the analytic expressions of ohta et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and gimenez  ( 2006 ) , even though those analytic expressions do not attempt to account for the spectral deconvolution .",
    "it is simpler than the quadratic or cubic functions that we have derived for other systems ( winn et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 , 2007a ) .",
    "we do not know the reason for the difference but it is possibly related to the much slower projected rotation speed of tres-2 .",
    "the fitting statistic was @xmath25 ^ 2 + \\sum_{j=1}^{67 } \\left [ \\frac{v_j({\\mathrm{obs } } ) - v_j({\\mathrm{calc}})}{\\sigma_{v , j } } \\right]^2 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26(obs ) and @xmath27 are the flux measurements and uncertainties of holman et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and @xmath28(obs ) and @xmath29 are the radial - velocity measurements and uncertainties from our new data and from odonovan et al .",
    "the two model parameters relating to the rm effect are the line - of - sight stellar rotation velocity ( @xmath30 ) , and the angle between the projected stellar spin axis and orbit normal ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the projected spin - orbit angle @xmath31 ranges from @xmath32 to @xmath33 , and is measured counterclockwise on the sky from the projected stellar rotational angular - momentum vector to the projected orbital angular - momentum vector ( see ohta et al .  2007 or gaudi & winn 2007 for a diagram ) .",
    "if we define stellar `` north '' by the sky projection of the stellar angular - momentum vector , then when @xmath34 the axes are aligned and the planet moves directly `` eastward '' across the face of the star , for @xmath35 the planet moves `` northeast , '' and so forth .",
    "the other model parameters were the planetary mass ( @xmath36 ) ; the stellar and planetary radii ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) ; the orbital inclination ( @xmath39 ) ; the mid - transit time ( @xmath40 ) ; and an additive constant velocity for each of the two different velocity data sets ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) .",
    "we allowed our velocities to have a different additive constant from the velocities of odonovan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) in order to account for systematic differences in the spectrograph setup and reduction procedures .",
    "we fixed the orbital period to be @xmath43  days ( holman et al .",
    "we used a markov chain monte carlo algorithm to solve for the model parameters and their confidence limits , with uniform priors on all parameters .",
    "this algorithm and our implementation of it are described in detail elsewhere ( see , e.g. , winn et al .  2007b ) .",
    "the minimum @xmath44 is 1127.6 , with 1091 degrees of freedom , giving @xmath45 and indicating an acceptable fit .",
    "the rm effect is certainly not obvious in fig .  1 , which shows the entire spectroscopic orbit .",
    "it is not even very obvious in the middle panel of fig .  2 , which focuses on the velocity data around the time of transit .",
    "however , our analysis shows that the rm effect was indeed detected .",
    "as mentioned above , for the best - fitting model , @xmath46 . if the parameter @xmath9 is set equal to zero , thereby neglecting the rm effect , then @xmath47 , with the increase of @xmath48 arising from the velocity data during the transit .",
    "we conclude that the rm effect was detected with a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of approximately @xmath49 .",
    "gaudi & winn ( 2007 ) have given analytic formulas for the signal - to - noise ratio of rm observations as a function of the system and telescope parameters , under the assumption of gaussian velocity errors .",
    "using their eqn .",
    "( 26 ) for this case , the forecasted snr is 2.9 , in agreement with the actual snr .    one might wonder how much this result was influenced by the inclusion of the photometric data . to check on this",
    ", we tried setting aside the photometric data and fitting only the 67 radial - velocity data points .",
    "we fixed the photometric parameters ( @xmath36 , @xmath38 , @xmath37 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath50 ) at the values determined previously . in this case we found @xmath51 . if @xmath9 is set equal to zero , then @xmath52 , giving @xmath48 , just as in the full model fit .",
    "this confirms that the lowered @xmath44 is an effect of a better fit to the transit velocities , and that the uncertainties in the photometric parameters are negligible in this instance .",
    "the best - fitting model parameters are also consistent with good alignment of the spin and the orbit .",
    "specifically , we find @xmath53  deg , and @xmath54  km  s@xmath7 , where the quoted values are the medians of the _ a posteriori _ distributions returned by the mcmc algorithm , and the error bars represent 68% confidence limits .",
    "table  2 gives these results , along with some other revelant system parameters of tres-2 , for convenience .",
    "visually , the rm effect is more apparent in the bottom panel of fig .  2 , in which the orbital velocity has been subtracted from the data , and the sampling rate has been effectively doubled by inverting the data through the origin ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) .",
    "this works because for @xmath57 , the rm waveform is antisymmetric about the origin .",
    "figure  3 shows the _ a posteriori _ probability distribution for @xmath31 and the joint distribution of @xmath31 and @xmath58 .",
    "the distribution for @xmath31 resembles a slightly asymmetric gaussian function to which is added a low - level uniform probability distribution .",
    "although only the region from @xmath59 to @xmath60 is shown in fig .  3 , this low - level uniform distribution extends all the way from @xmath32 to @xmath33 .",
    "the uniform background corresponds to the very lowest allowed values of @xmath9 .",
    "this makes sense because when the rotation rate is zero , the rossiter anomaly vanishes and @xmath31 is irrelevant .",
    "values of @xmath31 between @xmath59 and @xmath60 correspond to prograde orbits , for which the stellar and orbital angular momenta are in the same half - plane .",
    "the integrated probability between @xmath59 and @xmath60 is 98% .",
    "we conclude that the tres-2 orbit is prograde with 98% confidence . as an illustration of the constraints provided by our analysis , fig .",
    "4 shows a drawing of the face of the star and the orbit of the transiting planet .",
    "our result for @xmath9 is in agreement with the value reported by odonovan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , @xmath61  km  s@xmath7 , which was based on an analysis of the line broadening in an out - of - transit spectrum .",
    "this finding is also supported by an analysis of our own out - of - transit , iodine - free spectra , using the _ spectroscopy made easy _ ( sme ) software package of valenti & piskunov  ( 1996 ) .",
    "the automated analysis gave a formal result of @xmath62  km  s@xmath7 , although the true uncertainty may be larger , since with a disk - integrated spectrum of such a slow rotator it is difficult to disentangle the effects of rotation , macroturbulence , microturbulence , and the instrumental profile .",
    "in particular , the sme code assumes `` typical '' values for the turbulent broadening mechanisms that are of the same magnitude as the rotation speed of tres-2 ( see   4.2 - 4.4 of valenti & fischer 2005 ) .",
    "parameter with mean 0.5  km  s@xmath7 and standard error 0.5  km  s@xmath7 . in that case ,",
    "the mcmc analysis gave 68%-confidence ranges of @xmath63 to @xmath64  deg for @xmath31 and @xmath65 to @xmath66  km  s@xmath7 for @xmath9 , and showed that the orbit is prograde with 95% confidence .",
    "the constraint on @xmath31 was weakened because the sme result favors slower rotation rates , for which the sensitivity of the rm waveform to @xmath31 is reduced . ]",
    "we have monitored the apparent doppler shift of tres-2 throughout a transit of its giant planet and we have detected the rossiter - mclaughlin effect . using the available photometric and spectroscopic data ,",
    "we have found good evidence that the orbit is prograde , as are the other 6 systems that have been measured ( with the possible exception of hd  17156 ) , and as are the planets in the solar system . in this sense ,",
    "our results for tres-2 are not surprising . however , as mentioned in   1 , some theories of planet migration do predict occasionally large misalignments .",
    "for example , nagasawa et al .  (",
    "2008 ) investigated a scenario in which a planet is scattered into an eccentric , inclined orbit with a small periastron distance ( as envisioned earlier by rasio & ford 1996 and marzari & weidenschilling 2002 ) , and subsequently a more distant planet forces kozai oscillations in the inner planet s eccentricity and inclination . if the periastron distance is small enough during the high - eccentricity phases , the orbit may circularize at a small orbital distance with a substantial inclination .",
    "nagasawa et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found that this migration mechanism produces a very broad range of final inclinations , including a significant fraction of retrograde orbits .",
    "of course , prograde orbits are also permitted in this scenario , and our finding of a prograde orbit for tres-2 can not be taken as evidence against this mechanism .",
    "we raise the issue only to show that a prograde orbit was not a foregone conclusion .",
    "furthermore , we have shown it is possible to glean this information and measure the projected spin - orbit angle to within @xmath67 , even for an 11th magnitude star with a slow projected rotation rate .",
    "a potentially important application of the rm effect is the detection of planets that are too small to be readily detected using other types of ground - based data .",
    "for example , in many cases of terrestrial planets detected by the _ corot _ or _ kepler _ satellites , it will be easier to observe the rm effect than to observe the star s orbital doppler shift ( and thereby measure the planet s mass ) . the theory underlying",
    "this idea has been discussed by welsh et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and gaudi & winn  ( 2007 ) .",
    "the present work serves to illustrate this point with actual data .",
    "if tres-2 had a rotation rate of 5  km  s@xmath7 instead of 1  km  s@xmath7 , but all other stellar and orbital parameters were the same , then the quantity and quality of data presented in this paper would permit a @xmath683@xmath69 detection of a planet with a radius @xmath68@xmath70 times smaller than tres-2 , or @xmath686 earth radii .",
    "if the transit were equatorial instead of grazing ( the best configuration for detecting the effect , although not for assessing spin - orbit alignment ) , the duration of the transit would be longer by a factor of @xmath682 and the amplitude of the rm effect would be larger by a factor of @xmath682 , leading to another factor - of-2 improvement in the detectable planet radius ( @xmath683  @xmath71 ) .",
    "such a planet would produce a photometric transit depth of only @xmath72 , which is smaller than the transit depth of any known transiting planet .",
    "we thank g.  marcy for advice and encouragement , and d.  charbonneau for helpful conversations .",
    "we are grateful for support from the nasa keck pi data analysis fund ( jpl 1326712 ) .",
    "we recognize and acknowledge the very significant cultural role and reverence that the summit of mauna kea has always had within the indigenous hawaiian community .",
