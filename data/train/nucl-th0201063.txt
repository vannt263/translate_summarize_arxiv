    "knowing the properties of hadrons in a hadronic environment is presently one of the challenging problems in heavy ion physics .",
    "experimentally , the first results have been published with clear evidence that the properties of mesons change considerable when they are placed into a hadronic medium @xcite .",
    "theoretically , most of the efforts are concentrated around the mesons , where a substantial change of their rest mass is predicted .",
    "baryons have attracted less attention . however , the knowledge of their properties at finite density and temperature is a prerequisite for interpreting the experimental results of heavy ion collisions at ultra - relativistic energies .",
    "there , it is assumed that a plasma of quarks and gluons is formed during the reaction .",
    "this plasma then expands and cools . when it passes the critical temperature for the chiral and deconfined phase transitions , it hadronizes into a colorless gas of hadrons .",
    "since baryon masses change much more as a function of the density as compared to meson masses , the thermodynamic properties of the hadron gas and especially the particle abundances at this transition will be strongly influenced by the baryon properties in a medium .",
    "the nambu - jona - lasinio(njl ) model offers the possibility to determine the properties of the baryons at finite temperature and density . in this model",
    "the baryons are described as diquark - quark bound states .",
    "the njl model provides a simple implementation of dynamically broken chiral symmetry .",
    "it has been successfully used for the description of mesonic states at low - energy @xcite and some work has been done for baryons at zero temperature and density @xcite .",
    "we use an su(3 ) version of the njl lagrangian adding some extra terms for the qq channel interaction : @xmath4 + g_v [ ( \\bar{\\psi } \\lambda^f \\gamma_{\\mu } \\psi)^2   + ( \\bar{\\psi } i \\gamma^5 \\gamma_{\\mu } \\lambda^f\\psi)^2 ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + & g_d [ det \\bar{\\psi}(1+\\gamma^5)\\psi + \\bar{\\psi}(1-\\gamma^5)\\psi ] \\nonumber   \\\\ { \\mathcal{l}}_{q q } & = & g_{diq } [ ( \\bar{\\psi}^c i\\gamma_5 \\lambda^a_f \\lambda^{a ^\\prime}_c \\psi)(\\bar{\\psi } i \\gamma^5 \\lambda^a_f \\lambda^{a^\\prime}_c \\psi^c ) ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 projects on the color and flavor @xmath6 channel .",
    "the ratio @xmath7 is in principle fixed by the fierz transformation , but we choose to leave it as a free parameter .",
    "the model needs to be regularized with a 3-momentum cut - off @xmath0 .",
    "the parameters are fixed in order to give correct value for the pion decay constant , quark condensate , mesons masses . in this work",
    "we have used the follow ing parameters : @xmath8 mev , @xmath9 mev , @xmath10 mev@xmath11 , @xmath12 mev@xmath11 , @xmath13 mev@xmath14 , @xmath15 mev , @xmath16",
    "before describing the baryonic states , we must study the behavior of diquarks .",
    "they are ( q - q ) bound states , and therefore not observable in nature do their lack of color neutrality .",
    "first , we determine their mass in a hot and dense medium using the same formalism as for the mesons @xcite , the bethe - salpeter equation . in the qq channel it looks like : @xmath17\\ ] ] where @xmath18 ( @xmath19 describe diquarks ) with @xmath20 . here , we limit ourselves to the scalar channel ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the axial contribution to the baryon , which is not negligible as already shown in @xcite , will be treated later .    in the njl model rpa and bethe - salpeter equation",
    "are identical and can be rewritten as a geometric series .",
    "therefore one finally gets a simple form for the t - matrix , where the singularities determine the bound states . in order to determine their mass one need to solve the gap equation : @xmath22 for @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the diquark mass .",
    "we have introduced here the polarization function defined by : @xmath25 $ ]    previous calculations have been done in @xcite for @xmath26 and @xmath3 .    to extend this equation to finite temperature and density , we used the imaginary time formalism as described in @xcite . in order to build baryon states we need the coupling constant between a diquark and two quarks .",
    "it can be defined by @xmath27 .",
    "the basic idea is to build baryons in the same way as mesons or diquarks , using the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "to do this we need to know the diquark - quark interaction vertex which is not given in the lagrangian . therefore we have to add it in an empirical way .",
    "we start from the basic picture of a baryon ( 3 quarks interacting through gluon exchange ) and apply it to the njl model .",
    "each interaction is point - like , and two interacting quarks form a bound state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bar ] ) .",
    "the result is that quarks and diquarks interact by exchanging quarks .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we assume that the mass of the exchanged quark is infinite ( `` static approximation '' ) . and",
    "therefore the interaction becomes point - like , with the vertex : @xmath28 .",
    "the bethe - salpeter equation for baryons reads : @xmath29 where we have omitted the sum over the exchanged quarks , which is present if we study @xmath0(uds ) . instead of a quark and an anti - quark propagator",
    "we have now the product of different propagators : one for a quark and one for a diquark .",
    "following the usual approach to get the gap equation for baryons @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 are the isospin projections on the baryonic state .",
    "the finite temperature and density are taken into account using the imaginary time formalism .",
    "the parameters of lagrangian ( [ la ] ) lead to a cross - over phase transition in the whole @xmath33 plane . along the t - axis ,",
    "@xmath34 for @xmath35 mev . for the @xmath36-axis , @xmath37 for @xmath38 and @xmath390 mev .    at @xmath40",
    "all the particles are stable with masses : @xmath41mev , @xmath42 mev , @xmath43 mev , @xmath44 mev , @xmath45 mev , @xmath46 mev , @xmath47 mev and @xmath48 mev .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bart ] , we display the mass of baryons as a function of the temperature .",
    "all masses decrease with increasing temperature .",
    "this mass change is due to chiral symmetry restoration ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 go to their bare masses ) . in contradiction to models which have baryons or mesons as degrees of freedom , the instability of baryons with respect to diquark - quark system ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : bart ] ) can be calculated .",
    "nucleons and @xmath0 get unstable already at @xmath51 mev , where as the @xmath1 is stable longer due to its large strangeness content(s quark masses do not change too much with t ) .",
    "@xmath2 is a special case due to its weak binding energy , when the quark mass changes @xmath2 becomes unstable .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : strange ] we plot the masses of baryons as function of the density for t=0 .",
    "as we observed in fig [ fig : bart ] , all masses decrease and baryons become unstable for a given density ( @xmath52 for the nucleon ( @xmath53 mev ) and @xmath0 ( @xmath54 mev ) ; @xmath55 for @xmath2 ( @xmath56 mev ) . the value of the nucleon mass at @xmath57 is about @xmath58 .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of walecka or hqt models @xcite and also follow the results obtained in the other approaches @xcite with the exception that in the njl approaches we can also predict when baryons become unstable against description into a q - ( qq ) state .",
    "employing the nambu - jona - lasinio model we have constructed a simple formalism to described baryons as diquark - quark bound state . extending the gap equation to finite temperature and density ,",
    "we show that baryon masses decrease by almost @xmath59 close the chiral phase transition as compared to the vacuum values .",
    "this mass change may affect baryon multiplicity when a plasma hadronises into a hadron gas .",
    "it can also modify the thermal freeze - out point as already shown in @xcite .",
    "the next challenge is to describe the phase transition from a quark , diquark plasma into a hadron gas .",
    "a first step in this direction has been done for the mesons @xcite , but not yet for the baryons .",
    "our simple model can easily be employed to study the phase transition at finite baryon density .    1 quark",
