    "many complex systems display a very heterogeneous degree distribution  @xcite characterized by a power law decay of the form @xmath0 .",
    "this form implies the absence of a characteristic scale hence the name of `` scale - free network '' ( sfn )  @xcite . among these networks ,",
    "a certain number are of a great interest to epidemiology  @xcite and it is thus very important to understand the effect of their topology on the spreading dynamics of a disease .",
    "one of the most relevant results is that disease spreading does not show an endemic threshold in sfn when the population size is infinite and @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "this result means that a disease propagates very easily on a large sfn whatever the value of its transmission probability .",
    "in addition , recent studies showed that the presence of hubs in sfn not only facilitates the spread of a disease but also accelerates dramatically its outbreak  @xcite .",
    "the long - tailed degree distribution of sfn is the signature of the presence of a non - negligible number of highly connected nodes .",
    "these hubs were already identified in the epidemiological literature as superspreaders  @xcite .",
    "consequently , from a public health point of view , studying the spreading of epidemics on sfn is all the more appropriate .",
    "superspreading events affect the basic reproductive number @xmath2a widely used epidemiological parameter  @xcite  making its estimate from real - world data difficult  @xcite . as a matter of fact",
    ", it seems that superspreading events appeared in the onset of the recent sars outbreak  @xcite and could be crucial for the new emergent diseases and bioterrorist threats .",
    "their potential threat justifies detailed studies of the incidence of the degree distribution at the initial stage of epidemics .",
    "the variability plays an important role in the accuracy and the forecasting capabilities of numerical models and has thus to be quantified in order to assess the meaningfulness of simulations with respect to real outbreaks  @xcite . using a numerical approach",
    ", we analyze the evolution of epidemics generated by different sets of initial parameters , both for sfn and homogeneous random networks ( rn ) .",
    "we use the barabsi - albert model ( ba )  @xcite for generating a sfn and the erds - renyi network ( er )  @xcite as a prototype for rn . concerning the epidemic modeling ,",
    "a simple and classical approach is to consider that individuals are only in two distinct states , infected ( i ) or susceptible ( s ) .",
    "there is initially a number of @xmath3 infected individuals and any infected node can pass the disease to his neighbors  @xcite . the probability per unit time to transmit the disease ",
    "the spreading rate  is denoted by @xmath4 and once a susceptible node is infected it remains in this state . in more elaborated models ,",
    "an infected individual can change its state to another category , for example , coming back to susceptible ( sis ) , or going to immunized or dead ( sir )  @xcite .",
    "this s @xmath5 i approach ( si ) , in spite of its simplicity , is a good approximation at short times to more refined models such as the sis or sir models .",
    "the si model on both sfn and rn is thus well adapted to the characterization of the variability of the initial stages of epidemic outbreaks spreading in complex networks , which is the focus of this article .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in section",
    "ii , we study the fluctuations of the prevalence and we identify different parameters controlling them .",
    "in particular , we highlight the effects due to different realizations of the network as well as different initial conditions .",
    "we also investigate the influence of the nodes degree on the prevalence variability . in section iii , we present results on the infection time and its variation with the degree and with the distance from the origin of infections .",
    "we also discuss the effect of the number of paths between two nodes on the infection time .",
    "finally , we discuss our results and conclude in section iv.=-1",
    "we analyze in this section the effect of the underlying network topology on the variability of outbreaks .",
    "it is indeed important to understand whether the local fluctuations of the structure of the network can have a large impact on the development of epidemics .    in order to analyze this effect",
    ", we measure the variability of outbreaks as the relative variation of the prevalence ( density of infected individuals @xmath6 ) given by @xmath7= \\frac{\\sqrt{\\langle i(t)^2\\rangle -\\langle i(t ) \\rangle^2}}{\\langle",
    "i(t ) \\rangle}.\\ ] ]    in order to evaluate this quantity we run simulations for different `` model sets '' : first , for a given number of outbreaks on a single network , second for a single outbreak on different networks , and finally several outbreaks on different networks .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : cv_1vs1000 ] the curves @xmath8 $ ] computed for both the rn ( thin lines ) and the sfn ( bold lines ) and for two of these model sets : @xmath9 outbreaks spreading on the same network ( dashed curves ) , and a single outbreak per network for @xmath9 different networks ( plain curves ) .",
    "the curves representing these two model sets are nearly superimposed for both network topologies .",
    "the curves obtained from model sets made of @xmath10 outbreaks on @xmath11 networks and @xmath11 outbreaks on @xmath10 networks coincide with the other model sets ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "these results indicate that the contribution to the variability of @xmath6 given by a particular network realization is essentially the same as the one generated by different outbreaks on the same network .",
    "this confirms the intuitive idea that sampling different parts of a large network is equivalent to average over different networks .",
    "consequently , studying variability of epidemics simulated on one large enough network ( intra - network ) will lead practically to the same conclusions as studying variability on several instances of that network ( inter - network ) .",

    "this argument implies the existence of a peak which  as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cv_1vs1000]is located for ba networks at the beginning of the outbreak , with a maximum value larger than the one obtained for er networks . in order to characterize the relation between the variability peak and the network heterogeneity , we define @xmath18 as the time at which the maximum of @xmath8 $ ] is reached .",
    "we also use the fact that the heterogeneity of the network degree  often quantified by @xmath19is related to the typical outbreak timescale @xmath20 given by  @xcite @xmath21",

    "in contrast , we expect that other parameters such as the degree of the seed may have a more interesting effect on the outbreak and its variability .",
    "[ fig : cv_graine ] displays the evolution of @xmath8 $ ] for outbreaks starting from initial infected nodes with a given degree @xmath42 ( from @xmath46 up to @xmath47 ) .",
    "this figure shows that the variability peak decreases when @xmath42 is increased . in other words , when an outbreak begins from a highly connected node , the early stages of the spreading tend to be less variable .",
    "one might think that the number of paths available on a highly connected node leads to a higher overall variability , it is however not the case . as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : cv_graine ] , the prevalence increases with the seed degree , which may explain the variability for different @xmath42 .",
    "indeed , when the seed is a hub , the number of infected becomes rapidly very large and thus leads to smaller relative variations of the prevalence .",
    "this result leads us to investigate more thoroughly the degree of infected nodes and analyze the differences between ba and er networks .      in this section",
    ", we study in detail the degree properties of the infected nodes during the outbreak of the disease .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     the reason for this behavior lies in the difference of the numbers of shortest paths in these networks . indeed ,",
    "if we enumerate these paths , we observe that their numbers relatively differ between both ba and er topologies .",
    "we have computed the size and the number of shortest paths between a randomly selected node , i.e. a potential seed of infection and the rest of the network and we present in table  [ tab : nb_sp ] the average number of shortest path at distance @xmath48 .",
    "results are computed over @xmath9 random selection of the potential seed in order to get an accurate picture of the network .",
    "the table exhibits a difference in the number of path for @xmath49 ( @xmath50 difference for @xmath51 , @xmath52 for @xmath53 , @xmath54 for @xmath55 ) which confirms the fact that on ba networks , nodes have more paths to go from one to another in a small number of hops .     for two different configurations . in the first case infection",
    "occurs in one step and in the second case another path is added .",

    "table  [ tab : nb_sp ] describes the statistics of shortest paths but longer paths also contributes to the spreading of the disease .",
    "their role can be highlighted by studying the following simple cases . in the first case",
    "an infected node @xmath59 is in contact with a susceptible node @xmath60 . in the second case",
    ", there is an additional path from @xmath59 to @xmath60 going through a susceptible node @xmath61 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : avg_t ] ) . in the first `` direct '' case , the average time of infection @xmath62 of @xmath60",
    "is given by @xmath63 the addition of a longer path in the second case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : avg_t ] ) changes the behavior of @xmath64 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : td ] ) no longer holds for this case .",

    "( [ eq : avg_t ] ) predicts values always smaller than @xmath72 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : avg_t ] ) .",
    "this result could appear as paradoxical since adding a _ longer _",
    "path actually _ reduces _ the average infection time .",
    "in fact , the probability that the disease is not transmitted on both paths is very small and the existence of another path cuts off large direct infection time and thus reduces the average infection time of @xmath60 . since ba networks have a clustering coefficient larger than er networks  @xcite this result explains the small difference of infection times for @xmath73 seen in fig .",

    "we have analyzed in detail the variability of a simple epidemic process on sfn .",

    "consequently , it is statistically reliable to consider a single realization of the network , provided it is large enough .",
    "we have also shown that the prevalence fluctuations are maximal during the time regime for which the diversity of the degrees of the infected node is the largest . in order to analyze in detail this variability , we examined the temporal degree pattern of infected nodes .",
    "in particular , we demonstrated the high variability of superspreaders prevalence .",
    "we found that for the hubs the infection time is usually small but with fluctuations which can be large .",
    "even if the hubs are good candidates for being chosen as surveillance stations  given their short average infection time , they present non - negligible fluctuations which limit their reliability . in this respect ,",
    "the ideal detection stations should be nodes with the best trade - off between a short average infection time and a high reliability as given by small infection time fluctuations .",
    "the topological distance to the seed is also an important parameter in epidemic spreading pattern .",
    "nodes at a short distance from the seed are infected at small time  in the high variability regime  and thus have a large infection time variability .",
    "maybe more surprising is the importance of the number of paths  not only the shortest one  going from the seed to another node .",
    "the larger this number and the smaller the average infection time .",
    "this is an important conclusion for containment strategies since the reduction of epidemic channels will increase the delay of the infection arrival and will thus allow for a better preparation against the disease ( for example vaccination )",
