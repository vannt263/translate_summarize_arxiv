    "renormalizability endows the standard model ( sm ) with enhanced predictive power due to the fact that ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences from quantum effects can be eliminated by a redefinition of a finite number of independent parameters , such as masses and coupling constants .",
    "furthermore , it has been known for a long time that , in the most frequently employed formulations in which the complete bare mass matrices of quarks are diagonalized , the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing matrix must be also renormalized .",
    "in fact , this problem has been the object of several interesting studies over the last two decades .",
    "a matter of considerable interest is the generalization of these considerations to minimal renormalizable extensions of the sm .",
    "the on - shell renormalization framework we propose is a generalization of feynman s approach in qed  @xcite . recall that in qed the self - energy contribution to an outgoing fermion is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the self - energy , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are divergent constants , and @xmath4 is a finite part which is proportional to @xmath5 in the vicinity of @xmath6 and therefore does not contribute to @xmath7 .",
    "the contribution of @xmath2 to @xmath7 is singular at @xmath6 and gauge independent and that of @xmath3 is regular but gauge dependent .",
    "they are called self - mass ( sm ) and wave - function renormalization ( wfr ) contributions .",
    "@xmath2 is cancelled by the mass counterterm @xmath8 while @xmath3 is combined with proper vertex diagrams leading to a finite and gauge - independent physical amplitude .    in the case of fermion - flavour",
    "mixing we encounter not only diagonal terms as in qed but also off - diagonal contributions . the self - energy corrections to an external fermion leg are now @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the external fermion of momentum @xmath11 and mass @xmath12 , and @xmath13 the virtual fermion of mass @xmath14 . using a simple algorithm that treats @xmath10 and @xmath13 on an equal footing",
    ", we write the self - energy as : @xmath15 in analogy to qed .",
    "similarly , we identify the contributions to @xmath7 coming from @xmath2 as sm and those coming from @xmath16 as wfr contributions .",
    "again , @xmath4 gives zero contribution .",
    "we consider next the cancellation of the sm contributions with the mass counterterms .",
    "we start from the bare mass term in the lagrangian , @xmath17 , and decompose the bare mass into a so - called renormalized mass and a corresponding counterterm , @xmath18 .",
    "we then apply a bi - unitary transformation on the fermion fields @xmath19 that diagonalizes @xmath20 leading to the transformed mass term @xmath21 . here",
    "@xmath22 are the chiral projectors , @xmath23 is real , diagonal and positive and @xmath24 are arbitrary non - diagonal matrices subject to the hermiticity constraint @xmath25 further we adjust @xmath24 to cancel , as much as possible , the sm contributions to @xmath26 .    the diagonalization of the complete mass matrix @xmath27 by means of a bi - unitary transformation of the form : @xmath28 naturally induces a mixing counterterm matrix . note that the second equality holds only at one - loop level .",
    "the matrices @xmath29 are chosen such that @xmath30 is diagonal and are found to be : @xmath31    due to the transformation in eq .",
    "( [ completediag ] ) the @xmath32 bare interaction term in the lagrangian transforms as well @xmath33 with @xmath34 . @xmath35 and @xmath36 are explicitly gauge independent and preserve the basic properties of the theory .",
    "@xmath36 is finite and identified with the renormalized mixing matrix .",
    "@xmath37 is identified with the mixing counterterm matrix .",
    "following the procedure outlined in sec .",
    "[ prescription ] , a ckm counterterm matrix was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath38 with @xmath39 given by eq .",
    "( [ hmatrix ] ) . both @xmath40 and @xmath41",
    "satisfy the unitarity condition and are explicitly gauge independent .",
    "some years later an alternative approach based on a gauge - independent quark mass counterterm expressed directly in terms of the lorentz - invariant self - energy functions was proposed  @xcite .",
    "the mass counterterms so defined obey three important properties : ( i ) they are gauge independent , ( ii ) they automatically satisfy the hermiticity constraint of eq .",
    "( [ hermiticity ] ) and thus are flavour - democratic , and ( iii ) they are expressed in terms of the invariant self - energy functions and thus useful for practical applications .    a comparative analysis of the @xmath42-boson hadronic widths in various ckm renormalization schemes , including the ones discussed above , and the study of the implications of flavour - mixing renormalization on the determination of the ckm parameters",
    "are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have also considered the mixing of leptons in a minimal , renormalizable extension of the sm that can naturally accommodate heavy majorana neutrinos . here",
    "mixing appears both in charged- and neutral - current interactions and is described by the bare mixing matrices @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "following ones more the prescription of sec .",
    "[ prescription ] , we found that the charged - lepton mass counterterm is identical to that of quarks , up to particle content .",
    "however , in the case of the majorana - neutrino there are two important modifications due to the majorana condition @xmath45 ( here @xmath46 denotes charge conjugation ) : ( i ) in addition to the hermiticity constraint of eq .",
    "( [ hermiticity ] ) the mass counterterm should be symmetric , and ( ii ) now only one unitary transformation , @xmath47 , is needed to diagonalize the complete mass matrix @xmath48 . keeping in mind the two changes , the mixing counterterm matrices are  @xcite @xmath49 once @xmath50",
    "is fixed , @xmath51 is fixed as well .",
    "note that both , the bare and renormalized mixing matrices , are gauge independent and preserve the basic properties of the theory .",
    "we proposed an explicit on - shell framework to renormalize the fermion - flavour mixing matrices in the sm and its extensions , at one - loop level .",
    "it is based on a novel procedure to separate the external - leg mixing corrections into gauge - independent sm and gauge - dependent wfr contributions .",
    "an important property is that this formulation complies with uv finiteness and gauge - parameter independence , and also preserves the basic structure of the theory .",
    "the author thanks b.a .  kniehl and a.  sirlin for the collaboration on the work presented here ."
