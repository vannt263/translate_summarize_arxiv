    "the feynman propagator @xmath0 can be interpreted as the time evolution of a wave function @xmath1 that is initially localized at @xmath2 , @xmath3 . in the semiclassical limit @xmath4 can be obtained from the classical trajectories connecting the initial point @xmath2 to the final point @xmath5 in time @xmath6 . the formula which does this",
    "is known as the van vleck approximation .",
    "one is more likely , however , to be interested in the propagation of a smooth wavepacket , say @xmath7 , rather than an eigenfunction of the position or momentum operators . the straightforward way to accomplish this propagation , given",
    "the knowledge of @xmath8 , is with an extra integration , thus @xmath9 in the semiclassical limit this formula becomes @xmath10    one problem with this approach is that there are usually several classical trajectories going from @xmath2 to @xmath5 and they are hard to find , the so - called root - search difficulty .",
    "we shall return to a discussion of this point in section 7 . in the present paper",
    ", we shall accept the root - search problem and start from equation ( [ ba1x ] ) .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to derive various approximations for eq.([ba1x ] ) and to test them in simple problems .",
    "hence we restrict ourselves here to systems with one degree of freedom . in principle , all the expressions that we obtain are easily generalized to multi - dimensional systems . in practice , of course , the difficulty of the numerical calculations increases very fast with the dimensionality , and it also depends on the actual approximation used",
    ".    we shall evaluate the integral by the method of steepest descent which is also often called , somewhat inaccurately , stationary phase .",
    "we shall see that the stationary point is generally complex , giving rise to complex classical dynamics .",
    "such a calculation was performed first by heller and collaborators @xcite .",
    "the result that they derived can be shown to be identical to our eq.([ba14 ] ) .",
    "they used it to calculate the motion of a wavepacket in the morse potential .",
    "their work does not seem to have received from physicists all the recognition that it deserves .",
    "perhaps this was because there were two rather lengthy papers which contained many somewhat unfamiliar notions .",
    "their first paper @xcite reached the result through heuristic arguments and the second one @xcite , though more direct , made many references to the first . in our paper , on the other hand , we shall present in section 2 a very simple and very short derivation of heller s formula , eq.([ba14 ] ) .",
    "this basic complex approximation will be the starting point for all other developments of this paper .",
    "we shall show that it can be handled for relatively simple problems , but we shall also derive three subsequent approximations involving only real trajectories , which are different for each of the three cases .",
    "one case yields the well - known heller thawed gaussian approximation ( tga ) @xcite .",
    "the other two give different results and we shall show that they can be quite accurate in some situations .",
    "we shall illustrate the application of the various semiclassical formulae with two very simple examples ( section 4 ) and two not so simple ones ( sections 5 and 6 ) .",
    "we hope that our derivation of the basic formula and our examples comparing the several approximations will stimulate new interest in semiclassical formulae derived from complex trajectories .    in order to simplify our calculations we take for initial state @xmath11 a gaussian wavefunction with average position and momentum @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively , and position uncertainty @xmath14 .",
    "this state is also the coherent state @xmath15 of a harmonic oscillator of mass @xmath16 and frequency @xmath17 .",
    "it is defined by @xmath18 with @xmath19 the harmonic oscillator ground state and @xmath20 in the above @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are operators ; @xmath12 and @xmath13 are real numbers ; @xmath24 is complex .",
    "the parameters @xmath25 define the length and momentum scales , respectively , and their product is @xmath26 . the final form of eq.([ba1x ] ) , our semiclassical approximation for wavepacket propagation , is then @xmath27",
    "before we perform the integral in equation ( [ ba3a ] ) by stationary phase , we recall the relations between the elements of the tangent matrix @xmath28 and the second derivatives of the action function @xmath29 computed along the real classical trajectory connecting @xmath2 to @xmath5 in time @xmath6 . given a classical trajectory @xmath30 , @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 , its tangent matrix @xmath28 connects , in the linearized approximation , a small initial displacement @xmath34 about the trajectory at @xmath35 to the propagated displacements @xmath36 at time @xmath6 . the relation between @xmath28 and the second derivatives of the action is @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 . a derivation of this formula can be found , for instance , in sec.(2.6 ) of @xcite .",
    "notice that we define @xmath28 using the coherent state scales @xmath41 and @xmath42 . inverting this equation",
    "we obtain @xmath43    we shall write our final results in terms of elements of the tangent matrix @xmath28 , rather than in terms of derivatives of the action . in this notation",
    "the van vleck propagator is @xmath44 for short times @xmath45 is positive and the square root is well defined . for longer times",
    "@xmath45 may become negative by going through zero .",
    "this happens at the focal points . at these points",
    "the van vleck formula diverges and must be replaced by a higher order approximation involving airy functions . sufficiently away from the foci",
    "the approximation becomes good again , as long as one replaces @xmath45 by its modulus and subtracts a phase @xmath46 for every focus encountered along the trajectory .",
    "we shall not write these so - called morse phases explicitly because they will cancel out in our final formula .",
    "the overlap @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 in the semiclassical limit the propagated wavepacket ( [ ba3a ] ) is then @xmath49 with @xmath50       - \\frac{(x_i - q)^2}{2 b^2 } -i\\pi/4 \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we shall now approximate the integration over @xmath2 by the stationary phase method . to do so",
    "we assume that the pre - factor in ( [ ba7 ] ) is a slowly - varying function of @xmath2 , which means that the stationary point @xmath51 will be computed by imposing zero variation on @xmath52 alone .",
    "the pre - factor will be simply computed at @xmath51 and will not be expanded .",
    "we refer to section 3.3 of @xcite for a discussion of this procedure .",
    "we need to calculate the first and second derivatives of @xmath52 .",
    "the first derivative is @xmath53 where we have defined @xmath54 the second derivative is @xmath55 the stationary position @xmath56 , solution of the stationary phase condition @xmath57 , is given by the equation @xmath58 where we have used @xmath59 and we have made the definition @xmath60 equation ( [ ba9x ] ) makes it clear that @xmath51 is usually complex , and therefore the stationary classical trajectory itself is complex .",
    "it leaves @xmath51 at time @xmath61 with momentum @xmath62 , also complex , and it arrives at @xmath5 , which is real , at time @xmath6 .",
    "it goes without saying that , for such a complex trajectory , the tangent matrix @xmath28 is complex as well .    to integrate over @xmath2 , we expand @xmath52 around @xmath51 to second order , which means that we write @xmath63 .",
    "if im@xmath64 is less than @xmath65 at @xmath51 , then re@xmath66 has a negative definite quadratic term and the integral can be performed in the gaussian approximation . assuming this to be the case we find @xmath67 finally ,",
    "using equations ( [ ba10 ] ) , ( [ ba11 ] ) , ( [ ba4a ] ) , we notice that @xmath68 this simplifies the pre - factor in ( [ ba12 ] ) and we get @xmath69 } \\;.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] we have changed the subscript on @xmath70 from `` sc '' to `` ct '' to indicate that this semiclassical approximation is calculated with complex trajectories .",
    "equation ( [ ba14 ] ) , the semiclassical limit of the propagated wavepacket , is the heller result @xcite .",
    "it is the basic result from which all other approximations in this paper are derived .",
    "it is _ not _ an initial value representation and it may involve more than one complex classical trajectory . at first glance",
    "one might think that this formula represents a frozen gaussian , since the quadratic term in the exponent has a fixed width @xmath41 .",
    "a closer look , however , reveals that , since the classical trajectory is complex , all other terms in the exponent also contribute a real part , which changes the effective width : the complex character of the stationary trajectory makes the wavepacket thaw and , at the same time , assume non - gaussian shapes .",
    "notice that no morse index or phases of @xmath71 appear in ( [ ba14 ] ) . at @xmath72",
    "one has @xmath73 , @xmath74 one chooses the positive square root and the overlap ( [ ba6 ] ) is recovered . for other times",
    "one simply follows the phase of the complex number @xmath75 to get the phase of the pre - factor .",
    "before we close this section we re - write the boundary conditions for the complex trajectories in a more convenient form .",
    "the stationary trajectory starts at @xmath51 ( usually complex ) and ends at @xmath5 ( always real ) . the initial momentum ( also complex )",
    "is @xmath62 , given by ( [ ba11x ] ) and ( [ ba11 ] ) .",
    "since the coordinates @xmath30 and @xmath31 along the trajectory are both going to be complex , it is convenient to define the variables @xmath76 where @xmath77 in general . in this notation hamilton s equations",
    "read @xmath78 finally the stationary condition ( [ ba9x ] ) can be re - written as @xmath79 which is equivalent to @xmath80 .",
    "therefore the stationary trajectories are solutions of hamilton s equations satisfying @xmath81",
    "the stationary phase approximation of the previous section replaces the integral over a continuum of classical real trajectories by a few complex ones . finding complex trajectories , however ,",
    "is generally harder than finding real trajectories and one is tempted to look for further approximations to eq.([ba14 ] ) in terms of real trajectories only .",
    "these approximations should be good if the stationary complex trajectory is sufficiently close to a real trajectory .    what real trajectory ? according to ( [ bcf ] ) , the complex trajectory is determined by two pieces of data : a final position @xmath5 which is real and an initial coordinate @xmath82 which is complex ; see ( [ bc ] ) .",
    "the latter is made up of a real position @xmath12 and a real momentum @xmath13 .",
    "thus we have a total of three real parameters , @xmath5 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 that could be used to determine a real trajectory . since it actually takes only two parameters",
    ", we have three obvious ways of choosing a real trajectory that might sometimes be a good approximation to the complex one .",
    "the first way is to give the two initial conditions @xmath85 , which are the center of the initial wavepacket in phase space .",
    "the other two ways use the final position @xmath5 with a single one of the initial conditions , either @xmath86 or @xmath87 .",
    "each of these three choices leads to a possible approximation in terms of a real trajectory and , as we shall see , they are all different . in this section",
    "we shall derive formulae for each of these three cases .",
    "the extent of their validity will be examined in later sections .",
    "we can try to get a rough sense of how close these three real trajectories are to the unique complex one .",
    "the latter goes through @xmath88 hence the @xmath86 and @xmath87 trajectories have at least the merit of being at the right position for the final time @xmath6 . to judge the closeness at time 0",
    ", we can look at formula ( [ ba14 ] ) which tells us that , if im@xmath89 is sufficiently small compared to @xmath41 , the semiclassical wave function at time @xmath6 will be very small unless re@xmath90 is of order @xmath41 or smaller .",
    "this is a small distance in the semiclassical limit since @xmath41 is of order @xmath91 .",
    "we can also estimate the closeness of the initial momenta by looking at the stationary phase requirement ( [ ba9x ] ) , separating its real and imaginary parts thus @xmath92 again assuming im@xmath89 sufficiently small compared to @xmath41 , we see from the second equation that re@xmath93 is of order @xmath42 or smaller , and @xmath42 is again proportional to @xmath91 .",
    "the conclusion is that a semiclassical approximation in terms of real classical trajectories might be useful if conditions are right .      to begin , we choose the real trajectory defined by the two initial conditions @xmath85 , the central trajectory of the packet .",
    "we call @xmath94 the real end point of this trajectory at time @xmath6",
    ". this trajectory will now be the 0-order approximation .",
    "all values of @xmath95 and its derivatives that occur in the equations , including the @xmath28 matrix , will be taken for this trajectory , unless we state otherwise explicitly .",
    "all these quantities are now real .",

    ". then equation ( [ ba15c ] ) can be solved for @xmath98 @xmath99 to simplify the notation , the complex number @xmath100 will be called @xmath101 .",
    "we proceed to expand the exponent in ( [ ba14 ] ) about the real trajectory . as before ,",
    "the pre - factor is assumed to be a slowly - varying function and will be simply computed at the real trajectory .",

    "let us look also at the three approximations with real trajectories",
    ". for the @xmath85 case , formula ( [ ba18 ] ) contains both @xmath146 and @xmath147 the former is clearly @xmath148 , while @xmath149 , the constant momentum . for @xmath86 , formula ( [ wv2 ] ) , we need @xmath109 which is @xmath150",
    ". we do nt need @xmath151 , but it is obviously the same as @xmath109 . finally , for @xmath87 , formula ( [ wv3 ] ) , we need @xmath152 since the constant momentum is @xmath153 once again",
    ", for the free particle , all four semiclassical approximations give the exact answer .",
    "to make things less trivial , we shall now have the wavepacket bounce elastically against a hard wall placed at the origin .",
    "the packet arrives from the right with a negative momentum and we assume that it starts far enough to have no appreciable value at the wall at time 0 .",
    "the only relevant spatial region is @xmath154 the other side of the wall does not exist for this problem .",
    "of course the wall could be an approximation to a very steep , but not totally hard , potential , in which case there would be some barrier penetration to the other side . and",
    "it would be interesting to see what happens in the limiting process , but we shall not do that here .",
    "the exact solution is quite simple , once one knows the exact free particle formula ( [ freewp ] ) : you take the @xmath155 part of the latter , you reflect it with respect to the wall , and you give it an additional minus sign .",
    "thus the complete solution has two parts , both restricted to @xmath156 the original free particle part , and the reflected part which uses the @xmath155 piece of the free particle : @xmath157 this construction ensures that the schroedinger equation is satisfied everywhere and that the total wave function vanishes at the wall .",
    "next we look at the semiclassical approximation with complex trajectories , sec .",
    "2 . given @xmath2 and @xmath5 , both @xmath158",
    ", there are two ways to go from one to the other in time @xmath6 , the direct way and the way which bounces off the wall .",
    "the first trajectory is identical in all respects to a free particle s : it has the same action ( [ fpa ] ) and the process of finding the stationary point @xmath51 of the integration over @xmath2 is the same . hence , for this direct trajectory , formula ( [ ba14 ] ) yields the free particle result , restricted to @xmath159 the reflected trajectory , on the other hand , has a different action . the distance between @xmath2 and @xmath5 , including reflection , is @xmath160 , the speed is @xmath161 , the momentum @xmath162 , and the energy @xmath163 .",
    "hence the action is @xmath164 it differs from ( [ fpa ] ) by a sign change for one of the two coordinates .",
    "the initial and final momenta follow from this action in the usual way : @xmath165 compared to the direct trajectory , the only change that needs to be made when we look for the stationary point of the @xmath2 integration and we apply formula ( [ ba14 ] ) , is that the constant quantity @xmath5 must be replaced everywhere by @xmath166 .",
    "thus we get again the free particle result , but for the value @xmath166 of the position .",
    "this approximation , therefore , yields the exact answer ( [ wall ] ) , except for the minus sign in front of the second term .",
    "this minus sign due to reflection is expected on very general grounds .",
    "it is a special case of the morse phase mentioned in sec . 2 , and it is understood easily if one looks at a soft barrier , such as a finite square step , and one goes to the infinite limit .",
    "now let us try to apply to the hard wall the approximation with the @xmath85 real trajectory of sec .",
    "we shall see that it does not work for this kind of problem . in this formulation",
    "there is a single trajectory , which begins at @xmath85 and evolves with @xmath6 .",
    "its endpoint is given by @xmath167 until it hits the wall , which happens for time @xmath168 .",
    "after this time @xmath146 becomes @xmath169 .",
    "formula ( [ ba18 ] ) yields for a given @xmath6 a single gaussian wavepacket whose center follows this trajectory .",
    "the packet is incoming for @xmath170 and outgoing for @xmath171 .",
    "incoming and outgoing are never present at the same time and therefore there are no interference effects . in a calculation for a soft wall , one would see the full amplitude of the gaussian packet on the back side of the wall , with no damping due to barrier penetration , and again no interference effects .",
    "on the other hand , the other two approximations with real trajectories , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , do work fine for the hard wall and give the exact answer .",
    "each of them contains a direct and a reflected trajectory at all times , hence a sum of two wavepackets with interference .",
    "the hard wall is probably the simplest example after the free particle .",
    "however , except for @xmath172 , the calculation involves two trajectories .",
    "our aim here is to consider a potential where a single classical trajectory contributes to the semiclassical formulae , to avoid dealing with interference and focus only on the differences arising from the complex or real character of a trajectory .",
    "we choose an inverted gaussian potential with hamiltonian @xmath173 the system has a single parameter , which is the width of the wavepacket .",
    "we set @xmath174 and we place the packet initially at @xmath175 , @xmath176 , hence central energy 1/8 .",
    "there is a single bound level with energy -0.48 , which excludes two simple limits : that in which the potential is just a perturbation , and that in which the problem is highly semiclassical . here",
    "both the real and the complex trajectories need to be calculated numerically , as well as the exact packet propagation of course . the numerical methods for the trajectories will be discussed in the next section .",
    "1 shows the wave packet at @xmath177 for the different approximations , compared with the exact result , for two values of the width , @xmath178 and @xmath179 the packet spreads very fast and rapidly becomes highly non - gaussian .",
    "it is remarkable how well this non - gaussian character is reproduced by some of the approximations , though not all .",
    "we shall have more to say in section 7 about comparing the various approximations .",
    "the top two graphs are the probability density versus @xmath5 . the bottom two are the phase of the wave function",
    ". both the modulus and the phase are very well reproduced by @xmath180 the approximation via complex trajectories , and @xmath181 one of the real trajectories approximations , @xmath182 being just as good as @xmath132 for this . on the other hand @xmath172 , which is a pure gaussian , does not do well at all .",
    "the small zig - zags in the approximate calculations of the phase are due to numerical imprecisions . here , as well as in the next section , we do not show @xmath183 because it displays basically the same features as its counterpart @xmath184 calculations with other values of @xmath41 show these results to be robust , in the sense that @xmath182 is always very similar to @xmath132 and that both agree well with the exact propagation .",
    "in this section we apply our semiclassical formulae to the case of a totally binding potential .",
    "we choose the quartic oscillator because it is probably the simplest system after the harmonic oscillator ( for which all semiclassical formulae of sections 2 and 3 are exact ) .",

    "this gives @xmath195 for the energy of the central trajectory , @xmath196 for its period , and @xmath197 for its turning points .",

    "the search method consists in propagating trajectories for all possible @xmath202 s and picking those satisfying the second condition ( [ bcf ] ) , @xmath126    as discussed in @xcite , fixing @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath6 and integrating hamilton s equations with initial conditions ( [ s42 ] ) gives , for each @xmath202 , a final coordinate @xmath203 , usually complex .",
    "this can be viewed as a map @xmath204 .",
    "the values of @xmath202 we need are given by the inverse map of the real @xmath205 axis .",
    "if the map is analytic at @xmath202 , then it is conformal .",
    "this implies , among other things , that the map is one - to - one in the neighborhood of @xmath202 .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath202 is a critical point of the map , a richer structure develops .",
    "if , for instance , @xmath206 , but the second derivative is non - zero , it can be shown that the map becomes two - to - one in the vicinity of @xmath202 , meaning that two different trajectories ( corresponding to two distinct initial conditions ) satisfy the same boundary conditions .",
    "this is the basic mechanism that generates multiple trajectories in systems with one degree of freedom . for short times",
    "the critical points of the map generically lie very far from the origin @xmath207 , corresponding to complex trajectories whose actions have large imaginary parts",
    ". as time increases , more and more of these points approach the origin , giving rise to significant contributions to the propagator @xcite .",
    "the singularities in the @xmath208 map produced by the critical points are called phase space caustics ( psc ) . at these points the square - root in the pre - factor of eq.([ba14 ] ) goes to zero and the semiclassical approximation fails ( it actually fails in a finite neighborhood of the psc s ) .    for fixed @xmath209 ,",
    "the complex trajectories form continuous families parameterized by @xmath210 among the many families that might contribute to the semiclassical evolution of the wave - packet , one is special .",
    "this is the family that contains the real trajectory that starts at @xmath85 , and we call it the _ main family_. if @xmath211 is the end point of this real trajectory , then for @xmath212 the trajectory in the main family is real . in terms of the map ,",
    "the point @xmath207 is mapped into @xmath213 . in some special situations ,",
    "the main family alone may provide sufficient information for the semiclassical calculation @xcite , but that is not always the case @xcite .",
    "fig.3(a ) shows the map @xmath214 for @xmath215 .",
    "the lines correspond to constant values of @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",
    "the conformal property of the map guarantees that these lines cross at right angle ( provided the same scale is used for @xmath218 and @xmath219 ) .",
    "the circle indicates the location of a critical point , corresponding to a singularity in the regular pattern of the lines .",
    "the thick lines correspond to families of trajectories for which @xmath220 the main family can be identified by its containing the point @xmath221 a more careful look at this figure reveals the existence of several other singularities in the otherwise regular pattern of crossing lines .",
    "each of them is a critical point of the map .",
    "the trajectories in their neighborhood , however , do not contribute significantly to the propagated wave packet , and we shall not take them into account .",
    "let @xmath222 be the exponent in eq.([ba14 ] ) . for real trajectories",
    "@xmath223 is @xmath224 .",
    "fig.3(b ) shows a greyscale topographic map of @xmath225 for the trajectories calculated in fig.3(a ) and in the same @xmath226 plane .",
    "the continuous thick line is the main family seen on fig.3(a ) .",
    "the line for the other family , which we call _ secondary _ , is part thick and part thin .",
    "the reason for this distinction is the following .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath227 for trajectories in the main family can be seen to be always positive .",
    "it starts with @xmath228 for @xmath229 , decreases to zero at @xmath212 and grows to infinity again as @xmath230 .",
    "for the trajectories in the secondary family , however , @xmath225 starts at @xmath231 for @xmath232 , and decreases steadily to @xmath233 at @xmath234 .",
    "this means that this family can not be included in the semiclassical calculation for all values of @xmath5 .",
    "there must be a cutting point after which the family can not be considered , otherwise it would cause the wave function to diverge .",
    "this phenomenon has become known as the _ problem of non - contributing trajectories _ , and has been studied by adachi @xcite , berry @xcite , klauder @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "the part of the secondary family shown with the thin line has not been included in our calculations .",
    "we note that , in @xcite , huber and heller do a similar calculation for a wave packet moving in the morse potential .",
    "to understand qualitatively the role of secondary families in the semiclassical limit , we consider @xmath26 to be really very small . in this case",
    "the @xmath86 and @xmath87 real trajectory approximations of section 3 become exact , and only the main family ( actually only a small neighborhood of the real trajectory ) contributes significantly .",
    "demanding the approximation to be uniformly valid as @xmath235 , and using the subscript @xmath28 for the main family and @xmath236 for a secondary one , we must apply the following rules : ( a ) trajectories with @xmath237 should be removed @xcite .",
    "this avoids the divergence of @xmath238 in the limit @xmath239 ; ( b ) trajectories with @xmath240 but @xmath241 should also be removed to guarantee that , as @xmath239 , the main family always gives the dominant contribution ; and ( c ) the discontinuity introduced by the sudden removal of a secondary contribution should be minimized .",
    "this criterion ultimately determines the choice of the cutoff point , which is located on the so - called stokes line @xcite .",
    "fig.4 shows the comparison between the exact calculation ( thick line ) and the different approximations of sections 2 and 3 for @xmath242 and @xmath243 the most interesting feature here is that the real trajectory formula @xmath182 becomes discontinuous .",
    "this can be understood with the help of panels ( b ) and ( d ) which show the initial momentum @xmath109 of the contributing trajectories as a function of @xmath5 ( for fixed @xmath12 and @xmath6 ) .",
    "we see that several branches appear , but it turns out that only the one shown with a thick line contributes significantly .",
    "since this main branch covers only a finite range of @xmath5 , the wave function drops to zero suddenly .",
    "in fact , the wave function diverges at the ends of the branches . in our calculations",
    "we have cut the branch a little before its end points .",
    "fig.5(a ) shows the real part of @xmath244 for @xmath215 calculated with the separate contribution of each of the families shown in figs.3 .",
    "the abrupt cutoff of the secondary family is clear in this figure .",
    "fig.5(b ) shows again the separate contributions of the same families to @xmath245 ( dashed and solid lines ) and their combined contribution ( thick solid line ) .",
    "notice the interference between the two families producing the oscillation in the probability density .",
    "finally fig.6 shows @xmath245 , the calculation with complex trajectories .",
    "each snapshot shows the exact result ( thin solid line ) , the thawed gaussian approximation @xmath172 ( dashed line ) and the complex trajectories approximation ( thick line ) .",
    "we do not show @xmath182 in these plots because the approximation is not good .",
    "the improvement obtained with the complex trajectories is clear . for @xmath215 and @xmath246 , however , we can see a spurious peak close to the turning points .",
    "this might seem to result from cutting off the secondary family at the wrong point , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "a careful analysis shows that it is not the case : cutting off the secondary family at a smaller value of @xmath5 would produce a sudden dip in the probability density followed by another sudden increase , as can be seen from fig.5(b ) .",
    "the spurious peaks are due to the phase space caustic that shows up close to the turning points . for the present situation , which is not quite in the semiclassical domain , the caustics have a strong effect on the semiclassical propagations and further corrections are necessary to improve the approximation . a uniform semiclassical approximation involving airy functions",
    "can be derived by considering cubic terms in the saddle point approximation performed in the integral ( [ ba7 ] ) .",
    "the derivation of this improved formula will be published elsewhere .",
    "we begin by summarizing the results . we have derived and written down in this paper ( sections 2 and 3 ) four semiclassical expressions for the propagation of an initially gaussian wavepacket , @xmath247 all four give exact results for the free particle and the harmonic oscillator .",
    "all except @xmath172 also give the exact result for the scattering by a hard wall .",
    "but @xmath172 is very bad for the hard wall : it produces no interference .",
    "we tested the formulae further on two examples of smooth potentials .",
    "for the attractive gaussian potential , the exact packet after some time is highly non - gaussian .",
    "both @xmath248 and @xmath182 involve a single trajectory for each @xmath5 , and both give very good results for the modulus as well as the phase of the wave packet .",
    "the same is true of @xmath249 but @xmath250 which is a pure gaussian , gives a very bad fit .",
    "the other smooth potential is a quartic oscillator .",
    "now there may be contributions from multiple families of trajectories and the results are quite different .",
    "we found in this case that the complex trajectories formula @xmath248 is superior to both the real trajectories approximation @xmath182 and the single trajectory approximation @xmath172 .",
    "one reason is that the real trajectories contributing to @xmath182 have finite branches , which causes a drastic discontinuity in the approximate wave function .",
    "the complex trajectories , on the other hand , form continuous branches that prolong into the complex domain .",
    "the projection of these complex families onto the real plane show that they follow closely the main branch of the real trajectories , but they continue to exist after the latter end .",
    "thus the paper s main finding is that the complex trajectory approximation , @xmath248 of eq .",
    "( [ ba14 ] ) , gives very good results , at least for all the cases that we looked at .",
    "and one may well wonder how it could be that a relatively simple approximation , based on a single trajectory , works so well .",
    "the short answer is that , actually , the approximation is not that simple and it is not based on a single trajectory .",
    "but we shall go into more details .",
    "many other approaches have been proposed for the propagation of an initial wave function , some of them especially concerned with the propagation in systems with many degrees of freedom . among them , initial value representations or ivr s @xcite have become especially popular .",
    "they are integral expressions over the phase space of initial conditions , in a spirit which tends to rejoin that of path integrals .",
    "the multiple integration is usually handled by monte carlo techniques @xcite .",
    "the initial impetus for these approaches @xcite was the root - search problem , i.e. the fact that the van vleck expression ( [ ba5 ] ) requires one to find trajectories determined by mixed initial - final boundary conditions ( starting at @xmath2 and ending at @xmath5 ) .",
    "this may lead to a difficult search in complicated situations , and in addition the root - search problem usually has several solutions , a fact which complicates further the time - development of the wave function . in the ivr s , on the other hand , the trajectories are determined solely by initial boundary conditions , as the name implies , and for each set of initial conditions there is only one trajectory , the unique solution of hamilton s equations for these conditions . the work of getting the correct propagated wave function is done entirely by the integration , as is the case for path integral expressions .    the present work is based on the van vleck expression and it is affected by root - search , except for the thawed gaussian formula @xmath172 of section 3.1 .",
    "root - search can truly be a burden , especially for multi - dimensional wave functions .",
    "more important , however , is the fact that characterizing the present approach as a one - trajectory or a few - trajectories approximation is highly misleading .",
    "we have used such characterization several times above , for instance in connection with the hard wall , or in the first few lines of section 5 .",
    "but the truth is that there is a different classical trajectory for every final @xmath5 , and therefore the number of trajectories is really infinite .",
    "the work of getting the correct propagated wave function is done by them .",
    "the one case where we truly have a one - trajectory expression is @xmath251 there , the same trajectory is used for all values of @xmath5 .",
    "this case is truly an ivr , though a very simplified one , not involving any integration over the initial parameters .",
    "the only initial parameters used are those of the center of the packet . and",
    "it is also the case for which , in our explorations , the agreement with the exact result is worst , showing that a single classical trajectory is just not enough . somehow , a variety of classical trajectories must enter into the formalism .",
    "in other words , we see the path integral idea reappear , feynman s original view of the connection between quantum and classical mechanics .    among the various ivr s ,",
    "there is one that has been especially successful and has had many applications , the herman - kluk approximation @xcite",
    ". it would be particularly interesting to have a direct application of the hk formula to the hard wall , since this is the simplest non - obvious case for which our complex trajectories formula is exact .",
    "we are not aware of the existence of such an application of hk , and it seems to us that the calculation will not be totally straightforward .",
    "perhaps it is not superfluous to repeat once again that the main new result of this paper is that semiclassical approximations using complex trajectories , especially non - ivr approximations , are capable of being surprisingly good .",
    "all our semiclassical expressions generalize easily to many dimensions .",
    "the detailed presentation of these generalizations will be published separately , together with numerical applications .",
    "we note that two - dimensional semiclassical calculations with complex trajectories have already been considered in the context of coherent states . in @xcite",
    "the quantity evaluated was the return probability amplitude , also known as the auto - correlation function . in @xcite",
    "the authors , who seem to have been unaware of references @xcite , calculate the propagated wave - function in the momentum or coordinate representation .",
    "but they do it for quantum maps , which is rather different from what we have done here since , in their case , there are no continuous classical trajectories , no hamilton equations , and no schroedinger equation . in the present paper we provided formulae for the calculation of the propagated wave - function for continuous systems in the coordinate representation .",
    "the basic equation for such calculations is the complex trajectory formula ( [ ba14 ] ) first derived by heller and coworkers in @xcite .",
    "we showed that one can approximate the complex trajectories by real ones , and that this can be done in various ways ( we mention three of them ) , with different degrees of difficulty and of accuracy .",
    "the various formulae so generated will undoubtedly have different domains of applicability . and the complex formula ,",
    "if it is practical , will always remain the better one .    as our final topic",
    ", we shall present an alternative derivation of a formula very similar to ( [ ba14 ] ) , which possesses the same three approximations in terms of real trajectories . the quantity we want to calculate is @xmath252 .",
    "to obtain the approximation ( [ ba3a ] ) , we introduced between @xmath8 and @xmath15 the resolution of unity in terms of eigenstates of @xmath253 , and then we replaced the exact @xmath253-propagator by its van vleck approximation .",
    "instead of this , we shall introduce between @xmath254 and @xmath8 the resolution of unity in terms of coherent states , thus @xmath255 and then we shall replace the exact coherent state propagator by its semiclassical approximation .",
    "the latter was worked out in detail in @xcite . performing the integrals over @xmath256 and @xmath257 by the stationary exponent approximation",
    ", we arrive at an expression which is very similar , but not identical , to ( [ ba14 ] ) .",
    "there are two important differences .",
    "one is that , in this case , the dynamics are governed by the smoothed hamiltonian @xmath258 instead of the classical hamiltonian .",
    "the other is that the exponent acquires an extra term given by @xcite @xmath259 this term plays a very important role and can not be dropped from the approximation .",
    "both @xmath260 and the @xmath261 dynamics get carried over into all the real trajectories approximations .    our main reason for mentioning this alternative is to stress that semiclassical approximations are never unique and that there are always many ways to base an approximate quantal expression on a classical solution .",
    "discussions of this appear in @xcite , who see it as a consequence of the over - completeness of the coherent - state basis , and also in @xcite .",
    "it is only in the limit of @xmath26 going to zero that they all become the same . from our alternative to ( [ ba14 ] ) involving the smoothed hamiltonian and the correction term @xmath260 , one can derive again three expressions in terms of real trajectories , different from those in section 3 .",
    "numerically , the two points of view yield roughly equally good ( or sometimes equally bad ) results . and once again , for quadratic hamiltonians , all the approximations we have mentioned are exact . while in section 3 the @xmath172 approximation was the same as heller s tga , for the alternative formulation it is the same as the approximation in section 4 of @xcite .",
    "the latter reference contains a discussion of the differences between the two results .",
    "both are initial value formulae using the real central trajectory of the packet , and both are gaussian in shape for all potentials and all times . both",
    "are expected to fail if the potential is not very smooth on the scale of the size of the packet . + acknowledgements"
