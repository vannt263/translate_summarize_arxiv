    "accurate and sufficiently rapid multiple scattering calculations of the intensity distributions of solar radiation reflected by planetary atmospheres are essential for performing the terrestrial and planetary remote sensing studies .",

    "the _ invariant imbedding _",
    "method is one such method , and it derives a set of integro - differential equations for reflection and transmission functions .",
    "it yields these equations by considering the change in the intensity of outgoing radiation when a very thin slab with given optical properties is added either to the top or bottom of the main body of the atmosphere .",
    "although the equations thus derived are the same as those derived by chandrasekhar ( 1960 ) by means of the invariance principle , the invariant imbedding method provides us with a short cut to arrive at them ; therefore we call them _ invariant imbedding equations_.    the _ doubling _ method , in contrast to the invariant imbedding method , finds reflection and transmission functions for a stack of two identical homogeneous layers whose reflection and transmission functions are known .",
    "first , a slab of sufficiently small optical thickness is considered , so that its reflection and transmission functions can be well approximated by single and second  order scattering solutions , which are simple . by repeating this doubling procedure",
    ", the reflection and transmission functions of any homogeneous atmosphere of arbitrary optical thickness can be produced .",
    "note that the doubling method is a special case of the _ adding _ method , where the reflection and transmission functions of a stack of two slabs of different optical properties are sought .",
    "one important problem associated with solving the invariant imbedding equations is that they belong to a class of so - called _ stiff differential equations_. therefore , it is extremely difficult to numerically integrate them with any standard technique such as the runge  kutta method even with an extremely small step size .",
    "the _ fast invariant imbedding _ method of sato _ et al . _",
    "( 1977 ) circumvents this problem by approximating the source term of each equation by low order polynomials of optical height @xmath0 measured upward from the ground surface .",
    "this approximation is initially a linear function followed by a piecewise quadratic polynomial of @xmath0 .",
    "these equations are then integrated semi - analytically over @xmath0 . as a result",
    ", we obtain a set of nonlinear implicit equations for the reflection and transmission functions at each integration step .",
    "these equations can then be solved directly by successive iterations .",
    "however , the fast invariant imbedding method still tends to be several times slower than the doubling  adding method for atmospheres of moderate or large optical thickness . in this study",
    ", we therefore attempt to improve the computational efficiency of the fast invariant imbedding method by incorporating the doubling  adding method to initialize the reflection and transmission functions of the lowermost layer .",
    "for simplicity , we ignore the effect of polarization of radiation , so that the scalar approximation of the relevant quantities is valid .",
    "let us also restrict our argument primarily to the computational aspect of the reflection function in view of remote sensing applications .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the entire atmosphere of optical thickness @xmath1 is suitably approximated by @xmath2 homogeneous slabs , with the first slab being the lowermost , and the @xmath2-th slab being the topmost as in kawabata and hirata(1985 ) .",
    "in addition , we assume that the ground acts like a lambert surface of reflectivity @xmath3 , which isotropically reflects incident light .",
    "let us measure the optical height @xmath0 of a given location from the ground , because we intend to build the atmospheres of interest by stacking slabs upward .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath4 denote the optical thickness of the @xmath5-th slab . then ,",

    "the atmosphere is plane - parallel and scattering  absorbing , and it has total optical thickness @xmath1 .",
    "the zenith angles @xmath12 and @xmath9 are measured from the local upward normal @xmath14 , and the azimuth angles @xmath13 and @xmath10 are measured counterclockwise when the upper surface of the atmosphere is observed from above .",

[ fig1 ] ]    the intensity @xmath17 of radiation reflected from a plane - parallel atmosphere can be specified by zenith and azimuth angles .",

    ". the azimuth angles @xmath13 and @xmath10 for these two directions , respectively , are measured counterclockwise when the upper surface is observed from above .    for a mono - directional light incident from a direction @xmath19 ,",
