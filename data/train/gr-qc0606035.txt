    "superstring theory @xcite is based on the extended stringy elementary states : @xmath0 and also , on the unification of the quantum theory with gravity on planckian level of masses @xmath1 which correspond to the distances of order @xmath2 cm .",
    "such a penetrating into the deep structure of space - time has been based on the convincing evidences :    a/ the brilliant confirmation of the predictions of qed which ignored gravitational field and has been tested up to the distances of order @xmath3 cm .",
    "it suggests that boundary of quantum gravity may be shifted at least beyond the distances @xmath3 cm .",
    "b/ the dimensional analysis , showing that @xmath4 corresponds to the energies @xmath5 which are formed from the fundamental constants relating quantum theory , @xmath6 special relativity , @xmath7 and gravity , @xmath8 .",
    "c/ estimation of the masses @xmath9 and distances , where the action of gravity may be comparable with the action of quantum effects , which is done by the comparison of the gravitational radius of the schwarzschild black hole @xmath10 with the compton radius of the corresponding quantum particle @xmath11 ( we use here the planck units @xmath12 ) .",
    "one sees that the equality @xmath13 is achieved by the planckian masses @xmath14",
    "i.e. by @xmath15 it leads to the conclusion that quantum gravity has to act on the planckian scale @xmath16    all that is convincing , except for the argument c/ . the schwarzschild geometry does not take into account spin of quantum particles which is indeed very high with respect to the masses .",
    "in particular , for electron @xmath17 while @xmath18 so , to estimate gravitational field of spinning particle , one has to use the kerr , or kerr - newman solutions @xcite . of course , there may be objections that quantum processes are strongly non - stationary because of the vacuum fluctuations , and they can not be described by the stationary kerr and kerr - newman solutions .",
    "however , qed tells us that electromagnetic radiative corrections are not too large . on the other hand",
    ", we do not know another solution which could better describe the gravitational field of a spinning particle . in any case , estimations on the base kerr solution have to be much more correct then on the base of schwarzschild solution .    _ performing such estimation , we obtain a striking contradiction with the above scale of quantum gravity ! _    indeed , for the kerr and kerr - newman solutions we have the basic relation between angular momentum @xmath19 , mass @xmath20 and radius of the kerr singular ring @xmath21 : j = ma [ sma ] . therefore , kerr s gravitational field of a spinning particle is extended together with the kerr singular ring up to the distances @xmath22 which are of the order of the compton length of electron @xmath23 cm .",
    ", forming a singular closed string therefore , in analogy with string theory _ the ` point - like ' schwarzschild singularity turns in the kerr geometry into an extended string of the compton size . _",
    "notice , that the kerr string is not only analogy .",
    "it was shown that the kerr singular ring is indeed the string @xcite , and , in the analog of the kerr solution to low energy string theory @xcite , the field around the kerr string is similar to the field around a heterotic string @xcite .",
    "the use of kerr geometry for estimation of the scale of quantum gravity gives the striking discrepancy with respect to the estimation done with the schwarzschild solution .",
    "we arrive at the conclusion that the kerr geometry has to play an important role in quantum processes on the compton distances of electron , of order @xmath24 cm .",
    "the local gravitational field at these distances is extremely small , and the strong field is concentrated near an extremely narrow vicinity of the kerr singular ring which forms a closed string of the compton radius .",
    "the kerr - newman metric may be represented in the kerr - schild form g_=_-2h k_k_[ks ] , where @xmath25 is auxiliary minkowski metric and @xmath26    one sees that metric is minkowskian almost everywhere , for exclusion of the negligibly small subset of the space - time . however , this stringy subset has very strong dragging effect which polarizes space - time leading to a very specific polarization of the electromagnetic fields . as a result , the electromagnetic field of the corresponding kerr - newman solution @xmath27 , which can not be consider as a weak one for parameters of charged particles , turns out to be aligned with the kerr principal null congruence .",
    "electromagnetic and gravitational fields are formed by the twisting vector field @xmath28 principal null congruence ( pnc ) , and acquire the kerr stringy circular singularity as a caustic of pnc .",
    "the explicit form of the field @xmath29 is determined by the one - form k_dx^= dt + z r dz + r r^2 + a^2 ( xdx+ydy ) - a r^2 + a^2 ( xdy - ydx ) .",
    "[ km ] it is a twisting family of null rays , fig.1 , forming a vortex which is described by the kerr theorem in twistor terms@xcite .",
    "pnc plays very important role , since the field @xmath29 determines not only the form of kerr - newman metric with mass @xmath20 and charge @xmath30 but also the kerr - newman electromagnetic vector potential @xmath31 and the flow of radiation in the radiative r otating solutions @xmath32    the congruence covers spacetime twice , and the kerr ring is a branch line of the space on two sheets : positive sheet of the ` outgoing ' fields ( @xmath33 ) and negative sheet of the ` ingoing ' fields .",
    "( @xmath34 ) .",
    "notice , that for @xmath35 the black hole horizons are absent , and space - time acquires a twofold topology @xcite .    _ there appears the question : `` why quantum theory does not feel such drastic changes in the structure of space time on the compton distances ? '' _    how can such drastic changes in the structure of space - time and electromagnetic field be experimentally unobservable and theoretically ignorable in qed ?    the negative sheet of kerr geometry may be truncated along the disk @xmath36 . in this case",
    ", inserting the truncated space - time into the einstein - maxwell equation , one obtains on the ` right ' side of the equations the source with a disk - like support .",
    "this source has a specific matter with superconducting properties @xcite .",
    "the ` negative ' sheet of space appears now as a mirror image of the positive one , so the kerr singular ring is an ` alice ' string related to the mirror world .",
    "such a modification changes interpretation , but does not simplify problem , since it means that quantum theory does not feel this ` giant ' mirror of the compton size , while the virtual charges have to be very sensitive to it .",
    "the assumption , that qed has to be corrected taking into account the peculiarities of the space - time caused by the kerr geometry , may not be considered as reasonable because of the extraordinary exactness of the qed .",
    "there is apparently the unique way to resolve this contradiction : to conjecture that the kerr geometry is hidden beyond the quantum theory , i.e. is already taken into account and play there essential role .    from this point of view",
    "there is no need to quantize gravity , since the kerr geometry may be the source of some quantum properties , i.e. may be primary with respect to the quantum theory .",
    "let us consider the wheeler s model of _ mass without mass  ` geon ' .",
    "_ the photons are moving along the ring - like orbits , being bound by the own gravitational field .",
    "such field configuration may generate the particle - like object having the mass and angular momentum .",
    "could such construction be realized with an unique photon ?",
    "in general , of course - not , because of the weakness of gravitational field .",
    "however , similar idea on ` mass without mass ' is realized in the theory of massless relativistic strings and may be realized due to the stringy properties of the kerr solution with @xmath37 in the kerr geometry , one can excite the kerr circular string by an electromagnetic field propagating along this singular string as along of a waveguide .",
    "electromagnetic excitations of the kerr source with @xmath38 has the stringy structure , and leads to a contribution to the mass and spin . in particular , the model of microgeon with spin turns out to be self - consistent @xcite .",
    "analysis of the exact _ aligned _ electromagnetic excitations on the kerr background shows an unexpected peculiarity : _ the inevitable appearance of two axial singular semi - infinite half - strings of opposite chiralities_. there appears the following stringy skeleton of a spinning particle , fig .",
    "the spin of this microgeon may be interpreted as excitation of the kerr string by a photon moving along a circular orbit , which is reminiscent of the electron self - energy diagram in qed    ( 150,100)(-50,0 ) ( 45,70)(0,70 ) ( 115,70)(75,70 ) ( 60,70)(15,180,0)3 ( 60,70)(15,0,-90 ) ( 60,70)(15,-90,-180 )    .    in the kerr s gravity",
    ", the virtual photon line of this diagram does not leave the compton region of the particle due to the kerr stringy waveguide . as it was shown in @xcite , the axial half - strings are the null - strings ( the schild , or the pp - wave strings ) and may be described by the bilinear spinor combinations formed from the solutions of the dirac equation .",
    "moreover , there is a wonderful fact , that the basic quantum relation @xmath39 is already contained in the basic relation of the kerr geometry @xmath40 , ( [ sma ] ) . indeed , setting @xmath41 one writes ( [ sma ] ) as @xmath42    so far , we considered the constant @xmath43 not as a quantum constant , but as an experimentally constant characterizing the spin of electron .",
    "let us consider now the classical fields propagating along the kerr ring with speed of the light and with the winding number of phase @xmath44 the corresponding length of wave will be @xmath45 and the corresponding frequency @xmath46 it yields e cm c = . [ q ] up to now , we have not used the quantum operators at all .",
    "we have used only the topological properties providing the two - valued representations by rotations , or the classical quantization of phase ( winding number ) . as a result",
    ", we have obtained the quantum relation ( [ q ] ) from the classical kerr relation @xmath47 it suggests that _ ` kerr s geometry ' may cause the origin of quantum properties , _",
    "in the weyl basis the dirac equation demonstrates some interesting peculiarities . the dirac spinor has the form @xmath48 and the dirac equation splits into ^ _ ( i _ +",
    "e a _ ) ^= m _ , |^ ( i _ + e a _ ) _ = m ^.[wspl ] conjugate spinor has the form     the dirac current j_= e ( | _ ) = e ( |_+ || _ ) , can be represented as a sum of two lightlike components of opposite chirality j^ _ = e |^  , j^ _ = e     the corresponding null vectors @xmath49 and @xmath50 , determine the considered above directions of the lightlike half - strings in the microgeon model .",
    "the momentum of the dirac electron is @xmath51 and the vector of polarization of electron @xcite in the state with a definite projection of spin on the axis of polarization is @xmath52 in particular , in the rest frame and the axial z - symmetry , we have @xmath53 and @xmath54 which gives @xmath55 and @xmath56 which corresponds to the so - called transverse polarization of electron @xcite , @xmath57    the dirac spinors form a natural null tetrad .",
    "the null vectors @xmath58 and @xmath59 , may be completed to the null tetrad by two null vectors @xmath60 and @xmath61 which are controlled by the phase of wave function .",
    "therefore , the de broglie wave sets a synchronization of the null tetrad in the surrounding space - time , playing the role of an ` order parameter ' .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the kerr - newman solution has the same gyromagnetic ratio ( @xmath62 ) , as that of the dirac electron",
    ". there appears a natural question : is it an accidental coincidence , or there is a deep relationship between the dirac equation and the kerr - newman geometry ?",
    "this problem is related to the problem of description of electron in coordinate representation , and to the problem of localized states in the dirac theory @xcite .",
    "it is known @xcite that the position operator @xmath63 is not hermitean in any relativistic theory , @xmath64 in the dirac theory , the problem of the operator coordinate is still more complicate .",
    "the plane wave solutions of the dirac equation correspond to the state s with a fixed momentum , and the position of electron @xmath65 is undetermined for the plane waves .",
    "the velocity @xmath66 for the operator of coordinate @xmath67 is @xmath68 and projection of the velocity on any direction yields @xmath69 dirac shows @xcite that this equation may be integrated , yielding for coordinate @xmath67 the result    x= -14 c^2 _ x ^0 e^-2i ht/ h^-2 + c^2 p_x h^-1 t + x_0 .[x ]    therefore , the velocity of coordinate @xmath67 consists of the constant term @xmath70 and the oscillating contribution @xmath71 the so - called ` zitterbewegung ' .    in the rest frame ,",
    "@xmath72 one can get @xmath73 and the oscillating part @xmath74 has the compton amplitude @xmath75    since this expression describes complex oscillations , it is more convenient to consider the complex combination x+i y = 14 ic^2 ( _ x^0 + i _ y^0)e^-2i h t/ h^-2 [ xy ] which describes circular motion in the @xmath76-plane along a ring of the compton size @xmath77 these oscillations take place in the plane which is orthogonal to the polarization direction of the electron .",
    "one can see here a correspondence to the structure of the kerr microgeon model .",
    "the ` zitterbewegung ' problem is related to the problem of localized states and leads to the treatment of a ` mean - position ' operator @xcite .",
    "the best solution in this problem was found by foldi and wouthuysen@xcite which performed a very nontrivial matrix transformation of the wave function @xmath78 and hamiltonian @xmath79 to the so - called foldi - wouthuysen ( fw ) representation , @xmath80 and @xmath81    in the new representation the negative frequency modes are suppressed , ` zitterbewegung ' is absent , and the new ( rather complicate ) position operator @xmath82 corresponds to the conventional concept of the velocity of particle , @xmath83= \\beta \\vec p /e_{\\vec p } .$ ]    on the other hand , the use of ordinary position operator @xmath84 in the foldi - wouthuysen representation may be transformed back to the dirac or weyl representation @xmath85 , leading to a complicate mean - position operator without ` zitterbewegung ' .",
    "this operator is simplified in the rest frame of the electron , @xmath86 , and takes the form x^= x^+ i ^[hatx].the resulting coordinate of electron turns out to be complex . in the terms of the null vectors @xmath87 and @xmath88 it takes the form ( |x ) = x + i a ( k_+k _ ) [ x ] , where x is a center of mass and @xmath89 is the compton length . in the weil representation ,",

    "it leads to the equation @xmath105 which may be split into two conjugate equations @xmath106 therefore , we obtain the transfer from the complex coordinate @xmath102 to the kerr - schild coordinate system x+iy & = & ( r + ia ) e^i , [ ksc ] + z&=&r , + t&= & r + . here",
