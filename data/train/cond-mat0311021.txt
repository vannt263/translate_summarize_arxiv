    "the time delay plays an important role in many systems such as optical devices @xcite , physiological @xcite and biological systems @xcite .",
    "the effect of time delays has been theoretically studied by using the time - delay differential equations ( des ) .",
    "its exposed behavior includes the multistability and the bifurcation leading to chaos .",
    "it is well known that noise also plays important roles in these systems , and its effects have been thoroughly investigated with the use of stochastic des .",
    "one of its representative phenomena is the stochastic resonance @xcite , in which the signal - to - noise ratio is enhanced for sub - threshold signals .    in real systems , both noises and time delays",
    "coexist , and the combined effect may be described by stochastic delay differential equation ( sdde ) .",
    "for instance , sddes are used in optics @xcite and physiology @xcite to model noise - driven systems exhibiting delay feedback . in recent years",
    ", there has been a growing interest in combined effects of noise and delay .",
    "the theory for sdde remains much less studied and has been a subject of several recent papers @xcite-@xcite , in which the stability condition for the equilibrium solution of linear delay langevin equation has been studied .",
    "its stationary solution is investigated by using the step by step method @xcite and the moment method @xcite .",
    "the fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) method is applied to sdde in the limit of a small delay @xcite .",
    "these studies have been confined to the stationary solution of sdde .",
    "more interesting is , however , expected to be its dynamics in a stochastic system with a large time delay .",
    "real physiological and biological systems usually consist of many elements , each of which is described by sdde .",
    "a typical example is a living brain , in which a small cluster contains thousands of similar neurons .",
    "each neuron which is subject to various kinds of noises , receives spikes from hundreds of other neurons through dendrites with a transmission delay and generates spikes propagating along axons . theoretical study on such coupled , stochastic systems has been made by using direct simulations ( dss ) @xcite and analytical methods like fpe @xcite . since the time to simulate such systems by conventional methods grows as @xmath4 with @xmath0 , the size of the ensemble , it is rather difficult to simulate systems with the realistic size of @xmath5 .",
    "although fpe is a powerful method in dealing with the stochastic de , a simple application of fpe to sdde fails because of the non - markovian property of sdde : an evaluation of the probability density at the time @xmath6 requires prior knowledge of the conditional probability density between times of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 being the delay time .",
    "quite recently the present author @xcite@xcite has proposed a dynamical mean - field approximation ( dma ) as a semi - analytical method dealing with large - scale ensembles subject to noises , extending the moment method @xcite-@xcite .",
    "dma has been first applied to an @xmath0-unit ensemble described by the fitzhugh - nagumo ( fn ) neuron model without time delays @xcite , for which original @xmath9-dimensional stochastic des are transformed to eight - dimensional deterministic des for moments of local and global variables @xcite . in a subsequent paper @xcite , dma is applied to an @xmath0-unit general neuron ensemble , each of which is described by coupled @xmath10-dimensional des , transforming @xmath11-dimensional des to @xmath12-dimensional des where @xmath13 . in the case of the hodgkin - huxley ( hh ) model with @xmath14 @xcite , we get @xmath15 . the spiking - time precision and the synchronization in fn and hh neuron ensembles have been studied as functions of the noise intensity , the coupling strength and the ensemble size .",
    "the feasibility of dma has been demonstrated in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to apply dma to langevin ensembles with delays , which are expected to be good models representing not only interconnected neural networks but also social and technological ones .",
    "when dma is applied to ensembles described by linear and nonlinear langevin equations with delays , the original @xmath0-dimensional stochastic des are transformed to the infinite - dimensional deterministic des for means and correlation functions of local and global variables .",
    "infinite - order recursive des arising from the non - markovian property of sdde , are terminated at the finite level @xmath1 in our approximate method , which is hereafter referred to as the _ augmented moment method _ ( amm ) .",
    "we may study dynamics and synchronization of linear and nonlinear langevin ensembles with delayed couplings , and examine the validity of amm whose results are compared to results of dss . in particular , for the linear langevin model with @xmath3 , a comparison is possible with the exact stationary solution @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next sec .",
    "ii , we describe the adopted model and method to derive the infinite - dimensional deterministic des from the original @xmath0-dimensional stochastic des .",

    "model numerical calculations for the linear langevin model are reported in sec .",
    "iiia , where calculated results of amm6 for @xmath3 are nicely compared to exact solutions available for the stationary state @xcite .",
    "our amm is compared also to the small - delay approximation ( sda ) @xcite which is valid for a very small delay . in sec .",
    "iiib , we present model calculations for the nonlinear langevin model in which the stable oscillation is induced by an applied spike for an appreciable delay .",
