    "it is known that if @xmath643 is a quadratic polynomial that is not a square of a linear polynomial and which has the property that its coefficients have greatest common divisor one , then @xmath643 is square free for an infinite set of @xmath58 ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "we wish to construct the sequence of @xmath641 inductively .",
    "to find @xmath644 , let @xmath645 , which is irreducible with constant term one .",
    "choose @xmath646 so that @xmath647 is square free .",
    "let @xmath648 .",
    "assume that @xmath641 has been defined for @xmath649 .",
    "we find @xmath650 with the desired properties as follows .",
    "let @xmath651 .",
    "consider the function @xmath652 .",
    "again , this polynomial is irreducible with constant term one , so there exists an @xmath653 for which @xmath654 is square free . since @xmath655 ,",
    "we let @xmath656 .",
    "notice that for each prime divisor @xmath1 of @xmath657 , @xmath658 , since evaluating @xmath659 at @xmath660 gives a quadratic polynomial in @xmath58 , with the quadratic term and linear term divisible by @xmath657 and the constant term one .",
    "it follows that @xmath661 is relatively prime to all @xmath662 .",
    "normalized to be symmetric , the alexander polynomial of a knot can be written in the form @xmath663 , where @xmath664 . in section  [ secexamplestopsplit1 ]",
    "we use the following fact .        as a polynomial ( as opposed to the normalized laurent polynomial ) with nonzero constant term , the alexander polynomial of @xmath669 is @xmath670 . expanding each term of the denominator in a power series and noting that multiplying by the @xmath671 term in the numerators does not affect terms of the product of degree less than @xmath672 , the degree of the alexander polynomial , we can focus on the expression : @xmath673 which we write as the product @xmath674 here @xmath675 is the number of solutions to @xmath676 , with @xmath677 . in the case of interest , @xmath678 and the genus @xmath679 .",
    "we will now show that for @xmath280 in the range @xmath680 , the values @xmath309 are alternately 0 and 1 , where @xmath681 is a constant to be determined .",
    "thus , using the fact that the alexander polynomial is symmetric , upon multiplying by @xmath682 we have the coefficients of the alexander polynomial are all @xmath578 near @xmath683 . to show that the coefficients @xmath309 alternate between 0 and 1 for @xmath684 , we first observe that in a given range of @xmath280 , all @xmath685 for @xmath280 even . to see this , write @xmath686 and @xmath687 ; thus @xmath688 .",
    "consider the sum @xmath689 where @xmath455 is selected to have the same parity as @xmath58 .",
    "( we require here that @xmath690 , that is , we need @xmath691 . ) to complete the argument , we next observe that the difference @xmath692 if @xmath693 .",
    "suppose otherwise .",
    "that is , suppose that there are _ distinct _ nonnegative solutions to equations : @xmath694 and @xmath695 with @xmath696 , @xmath697 , and @xmath698 .",
    "the conditions that @xmath699 and @xmath700 imply that @xmath701 , which imply that @xmath702 .",
    "we first consider the case that @xmath703 .",
    "after possibly rordering , the difference would give @xmath704 one solution to this equation is @xmath705 every other solution is given by adding a multiple of @xmath706 to the coefficient vector ( note that @xmath707 is a primitive solution since @xmath1 and @xmath6 are relatively prime ) .",
    "thus , the solutions with the smallest absolute values of the @xmath125coordinate to the unital equation are the one above and @xmath708 that is , the smallest possible value for @xmath709 is @xmath710 .",
    "but , since @xmath125 and @xmath711 both are nonnegative and less than @xmath712 , this is impossible . as an example , if @xmath713 and @xmath714 , ( so @xmath715 ) we have the solutions @xmath716 and @xmath717 with @xmath715 .",
    "we also have @xmath718 which imply that @xmath719 , so @xmath720 .",
    "similarly for @xmath711 , so it is not possible for @xmath721 .",
    "finally , we consider the case @xmath722 .",
    "thus , our coefficients would satisfy @xmath723 this implies that @xmath724 is a multiple of @xmath6 .",
    "but this would imply that they are equal , since under our assumptions , both are nonnegative and also @xmath725 , so @xmath726 and @xmath727 .",
    ".1 in in summary , if we write the alexander polynomial of the @xmath669 torus knot , with @xmath728 as @xmath578 as @xmath729 , then for @xmath730 , we have shown that @xmath731 .",
