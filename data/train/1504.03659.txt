    "temporal ordering of events from semi-/un - structured textual data ( e.g. , news article , clinical narrative ) has important applications in many practical clinical applications such as questioning and answering ( e.g. , personal assistance ) , timeline analysis ( e.g. , event monitoring , pathway extraction ) , and text summarisation .",
    "chronological ordering of events involves the tasks of named entity recognition and classification ( ner ) or event extraction , including temporal entity recognition and normalisation ( tern ) , and temporal relation ( tlink ) identification and classification .",
    "moreover , temporal ordering of events from textual clinical data include , at least , three nlp tasks :    event extraction ( e.g. , clinical events or concepts such as problems , treatments and tests ) ,    temporal entity extraction : identification ( e.g. , ` january 4 1988 ' , ` twice daily ' ) and normalisation , and    temporal relations extraction ( _ determine when a particular event occurred _ ) .",
    "for example , in figure [ figure : note_ex ] a number of events ( highlighted ) and te ( underlined ) have been identified in a sample clinical narrative .",
    "subsequently , the chronological ordering of events have been visualised in the given timeline .",
    "the methods described in this report has been inspired from a number of work derived from community held evaluations in relevant nlp tasks :      recent work in clinical event extraction has been notably pushed by recent community held evaluation in clinical named entity recognition organised as part of 2010 @xcite and 2012 @xcite i2b2 challenges .      likewise , temporal entity extraction has been notably pushed by a number of general domain semeval / tempeval @xcite and notably specific domain 2012 i2b2 @xcite challenges .",
    "the aim of temporal relation extraction is to anchor extracted events onto a temporal space .",
    "recent work on this problem have resulted from the 2012 i2b2 @xcite and more recently semeval-2015 task 6 , clinical tempeval @xcite .",
    "+ the remainder of this paper is structured as followed : section [ sec : event_extraction ] described the methods engineered to extract clinical events such as medical problems , treatments and tests .",
    "section [ sec : temporalentity_extraction ] describes the methods developed to identify and normalise ( iso-8601 ) .",
    "section [ sec : tlink_extraction ] describes the temporal entity identification and classification approach .",
    "section [ sec : experiments_results_discussions ] presents the experiments , results and dicussions .",
    "the conclusion is given in the final section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "this paper is largely self - contained + note that this report is a reprint from the author s thesis [ tba ] and significant improvement of intermediate results previously published @xcite .",
    "+ a number of components described herein are available as open source +",
    "the aim of the event extraction method is to identify broad clinical event categories such as , _ problem _ , _ treatment _ and _ test _ and map them to a medical knowledge base such as the umls metathesaurus for fine - grained semantic characterisation of event instances .",
    "these event categories will collectively be referred to as events from henceforth .",
    "we have adopted the i2b2 definitions of concept or event categories which are largely based on the umls semantic types , but not limited by their coverage ;      the core ner is a data - driven approach ( using the state - of - the - art sequence labelling algorithm crf ) to identify clinical events from healthcare narratives .",
    "the event extraction pipeline is made up of three main processing components : nlp pre - processing , the ner ( see figure [ figure : clinicalner ] ) , and negation .",
    ":        the nlp pre - processing pipeline is made up of lexical and syntactic processing components , specifically :    tokeniser ,    sentence splitter ,    word stemmer ,    pos tagger , and    chunker / shallow parser .",
    "the data - driven ner component utilises separate crfs trained for each event category : _ problem _ , _ treatment _ and _ test_. a combination of the forward and backward feature selection approaches were adopted to select a total of 20 most discriminant features from an initial set of 120 features .",
    "the same set of features were used across all categories as our analysis showed this was the best fit .",
    "the extracted features can be clustered into two sets : lexical and syntactic , with four feature groups across ( see the below list ) .    *   * @xmath0 : the token string or alphanumeric character sequence * @xmath1 : the stem of each token * @xmath2 : the pos - tag for each token *   * @xmath3 : the chunk tag for each token    further , the feature space is also made up of contextual features of the neighbouring tokens with a feature window size of 5 or [ -2,2 ] with respect to the current token .",
    "the _ window size _ corresponds to the number of tokens to the _ left _ and _ right _ , including the current token , of which contextual token features are considered .",
    "specifically , for each token @xmath4 and a given feature group @xmath5 , the feature space consists of : ( @xmath6 ) , ( @xmath6 + 1 ) , ( @xmath6 + 2 ) , ( @xmath6 - 1 ) , and ( @xmath6 - 2 ) ( see table [ table : nertemplate ] ) .",
