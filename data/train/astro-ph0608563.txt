    "from various lines of evidence ( e.g. , theoretical modeling , the cratering record on the moon , returned lunar samples , and isotopic data ) it is believed that embryo terrestrial planets in the solar system formed in @xmath110 - 30 myr , evolved through a period of potentially immense collisions , and then underwent a reduced , but still significant collisional period that ended with another violent episode  the late heavy bombardment  at about 700 myr @xcite .",
    "thereafter , the system was in a relatively settled state , setting the stage for life to emerge on earth .",
    "we are unsure whether this sequence was typical or exceptional .",
    "we are not even sure of the details of the steps because much of the evidence has been obliterated over time .",
    "hard evidence must often be supplemented with relatively poorly tested theory to assemble a complete picture .",
    "the obvious solution would be to observe these processes as they are occurring in other planetary systems .",
    "however , observing terrestrial planets around nearby stars passing through parallel stages of evolution is virtually impossible .",
    "the planets are too dim for detection against the glare of the central stars ; they are not sufficiently massive to be detected through gravitational recoil ; and relatively few young stars lie close to the sun .    however , there is a promising alternative approach , to study planetary debris disks .",
    "debris disks arise from collisions of asteroidal ( or planetesimal ) bodies that lead to cascades of collisions among the resulting debris .",
    "eventually , significant amounts of this material are ground down to dust grains .",
    "because the surface area per unit mass is large for dusty material , when these grains are heated by the central star they can produce a readily detectable level of excess emission in the mid- and far - infrared .",
    "the behavior of these infrared excesses can trace the different zones within a planetary system . for grains around an a - type star and large enough to be in pseudo - stable orbits , the mid - ir band ( _ spitzer _ 24 @xmath0 , _ iras _ and",
    "_ iso _ 25 @xmath0  passbands ) is sensitive to material largely between @xmath55 and @xmath150 au , while the far - ir band ( _ iras _ and _ iso _ 60 @xmath0  and _ spitzer _ 70 @xmath0  passbands ) is sensitive to material between @xmath150 and 200 au .",
    "detailed studies of the behavior with age of debris disks in these two bands can indicate how the stages deduced for the early evolution of the solar system are playing out in hundreds of other planetary systems .",
    "pioneering studies with _ iras _ and _ iso _ suggest a systematic drop in infrared excess with stellar age ( e.g. , @xcite ) , qualitatively similar to the drop that would be deduced from the settling down of the solar system .",
    "however , because of limitations in the sensitivity and the accuracy of measurements with these two missions , they were unable to show unambiguously how debris disks evolve .",
    "_ spitzer _ brings significant advances in both sensitivity and photometric accuracy , increasing our ability to detect low levels of infrared excesses around hundreds of stars .",
    "a - type stars provide an ideal laboratory to study the early stages in planetary system evolution , particularly in the zones relevant for evolution of terrestrial planets ( earth - like temperatures occur at about 5 au from such stars ) .",
    "their main sequence lifetimes are long enough ( @xmath1800 myr ) to encompass the entire period of interest , they are of high enough luminosity to light up their debris well , they are sufficiently abundant and bright that many can be observed readily , and they are cool enough that they are unlikely to create infrared excesses in the form of ionized gas .",
    "@xcite have already conducted a study of the 24/25 @xmath0  excesses in such stars , based on a combination of _ iras _ and multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ) measurements of stars in the field and mips measurements of stars in clusters . at that time , relatively few field stars had been measured well with _ spitzer _ at 70 @xmath0 . in this paper , we report mips photometry at 24 and 70 @xmath0  of 160 main - sequence early type stars , enough to give a much better understanding of the evolution of debris systems .",
    "the majority ( 128 ) of the stars in this study are from the _ spitzer _ guaranteed time observation ( gto ) programs ( astar , fab4 , and dirty12 ) , where most of them were selected to have known ages based on cluster membership or association with moving groups .",
    "an additional 32 stars are included from the _ spitzer _ calibration observations . in total , our sample includes 160 stars ranging in spectral type from b6 to a7 , but mostly ( @xmath185% ) from b9 to a7 .",
    "we have also developed a tool to determine ages from the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) @xcite for consistency checking and estimating ages for the stars that are not in clusters or moving group associations .",
    "two stars in the calibration programs are too bright to be observed at 24 @xmath0 , while only 9 stars are bright enough at 70 @xmath0  to be observed as calibrators . hence , a total of 158 mips 24 @xmath0  measurements and 137 mips 70 @xmath0  measurements are reported here .",
    "the aor keys , stellar properties and estimated ages are listed in table [ tab_sample ] .",
    "most of the stars in our sample are single stars ( according to the literature and/or simbad database ) ; there are only 10 binary / multiple systems .",
    "these are either spectroscopic binaries ( unresolved in ground - based optical photometry ) or wide binaries with separations larger than the mips 24 @xmath0  beam ( resolved at 24 @xmath0 ) .",
    "in addition , we also double checked the stars with infrared excesses ( identified by the method discussed below ) in the 2mass catalog , and found no nearby objects on the sky that could confuse the mips 24 and 70 @xmath0  measurements",
    ". therefore , the false detection of infrared excesses due to binary components or positional coincidence is unlikely .",
    "all data were processed using the mips instrument team data analysis tool @xcite for basic reduction ( dark subtraction , flat fielding / illumination correction ) .",
    "the known transient behaviors associated with the ge detectors were removed by time filtering the data in the 70 @xmath0  default - scale mode , and by subtracting the off - source chopped background observations for data in the 70 @xmath0  fine - scale mode .",
    "the processed data were then combined using the world coordinate system ( wcs ) information to produce final mosaics with pixels half the size of the physical pixel scale .",
    "the photometry for each target was extracted using aperture photometry with multiple aperture settings as well as point - spread - function ( psf ) fitting at both bands . by averaging the photometry using different methods ( including multiple apertures )",

    "we first determined the centroid of each target by fitting a 2-d gaussian core , then computed the averaged integrated flux within a large aperture ( a radius of 1494 with sky annulus between 2988 and 4233 ) , and a small aperture ( a radius of 623 with sky annulus between 1992 and 2988 ) . because the psf at 70 @xmath0  is not well - sampled and the _ spitzer _ pointing is good to within 1 , for aperture photometry at 70 @xmath0  default scale we used the wcs information to place the aperture center and measured total flux for two different aperture settings : a large aperture ( a radius of 2955 with sky annulus between 3940 and 6895 ) and a small aperture ( a radius of 1596 with sky annulus between 1803 and 3901 ) . at 70 @xmath0  fine - scale mode , we determined the centroid the same way as for the 24 @xmath0  data , but only used a single aperture ( a radius of 16with sky annulus between 19and 39 ) due to the limited field of view .",
    "we determined the aperture correction based on the theoretical stinytim psfs @xcite that were smoothed to match the observed psfs .",
    "an aperture correction of 1.143 ( 1.298 ) for the large aperture and 1.699 ( 1.972 ) for the small aperture was applied to the aperture photometry at 24 @xmath0  ( 70 @xmath0  default - scale ) , respectively .",

    "we trimmed the sample to the 19 stars where there are either detected excesses , or we could set 2-@xmath2 upper limits to the excesses at less than 5 times the photospheric flux density ( adopting 2-@xmath2 limits allows meaningful limits in the same range as the _ spitzer _ measurements , with a chance of one or two excesses slightly exceeding the actual limits for those 19 stars ) . because the two cuts are based on sky properties , and then on _ iras _ signal to noise , the remaining stars should be representative of the original sample of twice as many .",

    "there are two candidates among these stars to show possible excesses at 25 @xmath0 : hd 56537 , with a flux ratio of 1.32 , and hd 79469 with a flux ratio of 1.30 .",
    "both are in the `` marginal '' category , since the deviations from unity flux ratio ( no excess ) are less than 3-@xmath2 .",

    "hd 142105 has a possible excess at 60 @xmath0  ( 3.9 @xmath2 ) .",

    "samples , a total of 174 stars were used at 24/25 @xmath0 , and 153 stars for 60/70 @xmath0  to study the trends in amounts of excess emission .",
    "we further group the observations into bins in ages and amount of excess for three subgroups : `` no '' means no excess ; `` large '' means a flux ratio greater than 2 for 24 @xmath0  and 20 for 70 @xmath0 ; `` medium '' means the flux ratio is intermediate .",
    "the age bins were set so that the total number of stars in each age bin is roughly equal .",

    "it measures the fraction of the sky seen from the star that is covered by dust , and therefore the fraction of the stellar radiation that will be absorbed and re - emitted in the infrared @xcite .",
    "the fractional luminosity can be determined based on the observed [ 24]@xmath29[70 ] color temperature and an assumption of blackbody emission for the dust .",
    "however , the fractional luminosity estimated in this way is somewhat over - estimated since the dust grains in the system probably have a @xmath52 emissivity dependence where @xmath531 - 2 , and emit less efficiently at longer wavelengths than blackbody emission .",
    "the overestimate could be large , depending on details of the emissivity law .",
    "we discuss hd 225200 as an example in sec 4.5 ; the fractional luminosity is @xmath18% over - estimated between a blackbody and modified blackbody emission .",
    "large errors will result if these disks have substantial emission from cold ( @xmath130 k ) dust . in most cases , there are no observations to constrain this possibility very well .",
    "however , examining the three best - studied nearby a - type debris disks , vega , fomalhaut and @xmath37 pic , we find the flux ratio between 70 and 850 @xmath0  is @xmath1140 , @xmath192 , and @xmath1125 , respectively .",
    "given the distinctly different properties of these three disks ( age , fractional luminosity , and disk extent ) , an average flux ratio of @xmath1120 between 70 and 850 @xmath0  should be representative for early - type debris disks .",
    "this average flux ratio gives a dust temperature of @xmath164 k assuming a @xmath37=1 emissivity law , and the resultant fractional luminosity is roughly equal to or less than the one computed using the maximum color temperature .",
    "applying similar logic , an upper - limit fractional luminosity is also estimated for each of the stars in group iii using a computed color temperature by assuming that the excess flux at each band is three times the measured uncertainty .",

    "the majority of the stars have a fractional infrared luminosity @xmath54 .",
    "stars that only show 70 @xmath0  excess ( group ii ) generally have lower fractional infrared luminosity .",
    "the maximum fractional luminosities for group iii stars are much lower than the group i and ii stars , consistent with their non - detectable infrared excess . to see the general trend of the fractional luminosity with age , we divide the group i and ii stars into two age bins : older or younger than 300 myr .",
    "this division is roughly at half the main sequence lifetime of an a0  v star ( the histogram is not sensitive to this age ; it is similar if we make the cut at an age of 400 myr ) .",
    "the fractional luminosity distribution for these two age groups is shown in figure [ f_dist_agecut ] ; older stars tend to have lower fractional luminosity than younger ones , which confirms the results from sec [ decay_time ] and figure [ ire_trends ] .",
    "the distribution of the fractional luminosity with stellar age is shown in figure [ age_f ] .",
    "several characteristics are found in this @xmath50 vs.  age diagram :    1 .   the data are consistent with a general 1/@xmath4 relation in the @xmath50 vs.  age diagram but with at least two orders of magnitude variation in the amounts of @xmath50 .",
    "an upper envelope of 1/@xmath4 is seen in figure [ age_f ] .",
    "we do not detect any stars that are older than 100 myr and have @xmath50 values greater than 10@xmath55 in this early - type sample .",
    "all the only-70@xmath0  excess stars ( group ii , squares in figure [ age_f ] ) are old . no stars that are younger than 100 myr have only-70 @xmath0  excess . this trend could result from sample selection bias , because most of the young stars are at larger distances , and only 70 @xmath0  upper limits were obtained . among the 53 group iv stars ( no 24 @xmath0  excess and 70 @xmath0  is an upper limit ) , 6 are younger than 100 myr , have 3-@xmath2 upper limit ratios larger than 5 , and most importantly their backgrounds are clean based on the 24 @xmath0  images .",
    "these 6 stars are potential only-70 @xmath0  excess young stars .",
    "future deeper 70 @xmath0  observations can help to better identify their natures .",

    "this upper constant cutoff is not seen in these new _ spitzer _ observations ( item 2 ) .",
    "although decin et al .",
    "combine all the available spectral types on the same plot , it is possible that the maximum fractional luminosity is different for different spectral types .",
    "@xcite suggest that the total disk mass in a system and the location and sizes of the parent bodies are the three major parameters in determining the place in the @xmath50 vs.  age diagram .",
    "they conclude that a 1/@xmath4 relation indicates the dust removal process is dominated by collisions , and that pointing - robertson ( p - r ) drag would yield a 1/@xmath58 relation .",
    "collisions which result in small grains that are blown out of the system via radiation pressure are the dominant mechanism in removing dust in the bright debris disk systems observed by _ iras _ and _ iso_. this is true for these early - type stars since blowout occurs for grains @xmath610 @xmath0 ; however , radiation pressure from lower luminosity stars ( late k and m dwarfs ) may not be adequate to remove grains at all , and stellar wind drag is the dominant mechanism to remove grains in the young late k to m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "hence , for the a - g systems , p - r drag only plays an important role when the density of the debris is as low as in our solar system @xcite .",
    "therefore , most ( if not all ) of the stars in the @xmath50 vs.  age diagram should follow a 1/@xmath4 trend .",
    "this is consistent with what we see in these new _ spitzer _ data .",
    "[ age_f ]    assuming that the group iv stars have no 70 @xmath0  excess as well , the true lower envelope in the @xmath50 vs.  age diagram is then very low . the total surface area occupied by dust",
    "may be greatly enhanced by collisions , and then follow a 1/@xmath4 steady state collisional cascade .",
    "if the only-70 @xmath0  excesses are , indeed , only found associated with older stars , it means that the clearing process ( collisions ) is an inside - out process .",
    "the collision frequency is higher closer to the stars because of larger relative velocities ; therefore , the dust will be ground down to finer debris ( subject to radiation blowout ) faster .",
    "this is consistent with what @xcite has suggested .",
    "alternatively , the `` clearing '' of the inner region could also arise from the decline of inward grain transport , rather than the removal of the initial inner disk grain population .",
    "a secular decline in the collision rate in the outer disk might account for a drop in inward grain transport , and thus a drop in 24 @xmath0  emission with time . a crucial question for this model",
    "is whether the particles generated at the 70 @xmath0  emission zone ( 50 - 200 au for a stars ) have enough time to drift inward before they get destroyed by collisions .",
    "assuming an a - type star of 2.5 m@xmath59 and 60 l@xmath59 with a debris disk of @xmath60 , the p - r lifetime ( @xmath61 yr ) is roughly 100 times the collisional lifetime ( @xmath62 yr ) for grains with radii @xmath1100 @xmath0  and density of 2.5 g/@xmath63 at distances of 50 - 200 au from the star .",
    "therefore , the population of the particles that drift inward from the 70 @xmath0  zone to the 24 @xmath0  emission zone is likely to be small .",
    "furthermore , we do not expect the color temperature to evolve with time if the 24 @xmath0  emission comes from material that is spiraling in from the colder , outer disk via p - r drag .",
    "the amount of the dust we see in these systems suggests the dominant particle removal mechanism is through collisions .",
    "p - r drag may only be important for older systems because it does not explain the dust temperature trend seen in the systems from 5 to 850 myr of age .      as has been thoroughly discussed in the literature , debris disk modeling based on the broadband sed alone is degenerate , and hence not conclusive in constraining the debris distribution or dust properties .",
    "based on the resolved disk surface brightness profiles ( 100 - 800 au ) , @xcite have shown that the majority of the dust particles in the disk are small grains in the proto - type vega debris disk . in comparison ,",
    "the vega sed has been modeled using large 30 - 200 @xmath0  grains in a ring - like ( 80 - 120 au ) disk @xcite .",

    "unfortunately most of the debris disks we discuss here are not resolved with _",
    "s beams . without further constraints ,",
    "there are many degeneracies using two data points ( 24 and 70 @xmath0 ) to constrain a ( at least ) 6-parameter disk model ( surface density power - law index @xmath64 , grain size power - law index @xmath65 , grain size limits ( @xmath66 to @xmath67 ) , disk extent ( @xmath68 to @xmath69 ) ) .    [ sedexample ]    as an illustration , we fit the observed sed of hd 225200 with two different pre - determined models : vega - like or kbo - like , using astronomical silicate grains . in the vega - like model ,",
    "we restrict the grains to be `` small '' ( i.e. , @xmath70 @xmath0 , @xmath7150 @xmath0 , @xmath72 ) , and to be driven outward by radiation pressure , therefore , @xmath73 . in the kbo - like model",
    ", we restrict the grains to be `` large '' ( i.e. , @xmath74 @xmath0 , @xmath75100 @xmath0 , @xmath76 ) , and to spiral inward due to the p - r drag , therefore , @xmath77 . the remaining two parameters to fit are @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we searched large regions of parameter space , computing a @xmath24 statistic at each point . at 90% confidence , we find that @xmath78 au , @xmath79 au with dust mass of @xmath80 for the kbo - like model , and @xmath81 au , @xmath82 au with dust mass of @xmath83 for the vega - like model .",
    "figure [ sedexample ] shows the resultant seds .",
    "the outer radius in the vega - like model ( @xmath1900 au , @xmath17  given a distance of 129 pc ) is theoretically resolvable with mips at 24 @xmath0 .",
    "the fact that our shallow 24 @xmath0  observation indicates hd 225200 to be an unresolved point source indicates either that deeper imaging might be required to detect the disk outer boundary , or that vega - like grains are not likely present in the system .",
    "furthermore , the two models yield different amounts of emission at wavelengths greater than @xmath1100 @xmath0 . without resolved images , data points at far - infrared and sub - millimeter wavelegnths can provide further constraints on the disk outer boundary .",
    "follow - up irs observations of these a - type debris disks can also put additional constraints on the disk model ( inner radius and grain sizes ) , and will be addressed in another paper .",

    "the infrared excess rate is 32@xmath335% and @xmath333@xmath335% for 24 and 70 @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the excess detection rate around these early - type stars is significantly higher than the one found in the old fgk @xcite and m - type stars @xcite .",
    "however , recent studies by @xcite and @xcite show that the excess rate for young fgk stars is also higher than for old fgk stars ; most importantly , the evolution in the trend of excess rate vs.  age looks similar between a stars and fgk stars ( only the absolute fraction is different ) in their studies .",
    "it is difficult to determine whether there is an intrinsic difference in the infrared excess rates between a - type and fgk stars because equivalent levels of fractional luminosity become increasingly hard to detect as the star becomes cooler .",
    "the incidence of debris disks is actually the convolution of how many stars actually possess debris disks with given properties , and how detectable the disks are with _",
    "spitzer _ , and this convolution is a strong function of spectral type .",
    "thus debris - disk excess emission is not a steep function of stellar type . since the detectability of a given level of fractional excess decreases with decreasing stellar temperature , the incidence of excesses is consistent with a similar debris disk driven fractional excesses between a and k stars .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that age is the most important factor in determining the detectability of infrared excess among a- to k - type main - sequence stars , not stellar mass .",
    "the amount of excess emission decreases with stellar age and follows a simple @xmath84 relationship in general with @xmath39150 myr for excesses at 24 @xmath0  but @xmath40400 myr at 70 @xmath0 ; that is , 24 @xmath0  excesses decay more rapidly than those at 70 @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , at any given age there exists a large variety in the amount of 24 and 70 @xmath0  excess emission .",
    "the observed [ 24]@xmath29[70 ] color temperatures for a total of 44 debris disks with 24 and/or 70 @xmath0  excesses range from @xmath160 to @xmath1250 k , but the majority of the disks have a typical temperature of @xmath1 90 k. furthermore , older stars ( age @xmath27 300 myr ) tend to have colder observed [ 24]@xmath29[70 ] color temperatures than young ones . assuming the dust we detect is blackbody - like , the decline of the [ 24]@xmath29[70 ] color implies the debris is located further away from the stars in the older systems .",
    "the fractional luminosity for these 44 early - type debris disks ranges from @xmath110@xmath55 to @xmath110@xmath85 .",
    "the trend between the fractional luminosity and stellar age follows a general 1/@xmath4 relationship ; older stars tend to have lower fractional luminosity than younger ones .",
    "an upper envelope of 1/@xmath4 is seen in the fractional luminosity vs.  age diagram , suggesting that collisions followed by radiation pressure blowing out small grains are the dominant process to remove grains in these systems .",

    "<S> the thermal infrared excess is identified by comparing the deviation ( @xmath13% and @xmath115% at the 1-@xmath2 level at 24 and 70 @xmath0 , respectively ) between the measurements and the synthetic kurucz photospheric predictions . </S>",
    "<S> stars showing excess infrared emission due to strong emission lines or extended nebulosity seen at 24 @xmath0  are excluded from our sample ; therefore , the remaining infrared excesses are likely to arise from circumstellar debris disks . at the 3-@xmath2 confidence level , </S>",
    "<S> the excess rate at 24 and 70 @xmath0  is 32% and @xmath333% ( with an uncertainty of 5% ) , considerably higher than has been found for old solar analogs and m dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> our measurements place constraints on the fractional dust luminosities and temperatures in the disks . </S>",
    "<S> we find that older stars tend to have lower fractional dust luminosity than younger ones . while the fractional luminosity from the excess infrared emission follows a general 1/@xmath4 relationship , the values at a given stellar age vary by at least two orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that ( 1 ) older stars possess a narrow range of temperature distribution peaking at colder temperatures , and ( 2 ) the disk emission at 70 @xmath0  persists longer than that at 24 @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> both results suggest that the debris - disk clearing process is more effective in the inner regions . </S>"
