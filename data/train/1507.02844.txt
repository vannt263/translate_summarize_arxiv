    "aqueous dispersions of smectite clay minerals have been investigated extensively during the last decade to understand their rich phase behaviors @xcite , aging dynamics @xcite and unusual flow properties @xcite .",
    "the bulk properties of these dispersions originate from the complex self organization of charged anisotropic clay platelets @xcite , which leads to various phases such as gels , glasses @xcite , empty liquids , equilibrium gels @xcite and nematic liquid crystals @xcite . these phases and their bulk behaviors",
    "can easily be realized by tuning the colloidal interactions externally .",
    "this has led to widespread applications of these clay minerals as rheological modifiers and stabilizers in paints @xcite , well bore drilling @xcite , cosmetics @xcite , pharmaceuticals @xcite , agrochemicals and nanocomposites @xcite .",
    "the charged anisotropic platelets of the na - montmorillonite clay mineral used in this work are naturally occurring flexible nanosheets @xcite .",
    "the platelets are highly polydisperse in their lateral sizes and shapes .",
    "the surfaces of these platelets have negative charges while the edges have ph dependent positive charges . in aqueous dispersions ,",
    "the clay platelets are surrounded by hydrated na@xmath0 counterions that form anisotropic electric double layers ( edl ) around the platelets .",
    "due to high concentration of negative charges on their basal surfaces , there is a small amount of spill - over of the negative potential onto the positively charged edges at ph@xmath17 @xcite . due to the presence of the anisotropic edl ,",
    "the effective excluded volume of each platelet is much higher than its geometrical volume .",
    "the interaction potential between these platelets in dilute samples is usually represented by the dlvo theory @xcite and depends on the mutual separation , the relative orientations and the charge distribution on the platelets .",
    "thus , the formation of kinetically arrested phases such as soft glasses and gels in the dispersions can be controlled by changing clay mineral concentration , salt concentration and ph of the medium @xcite .",
    "the rheological and stability properties of these disordered phases are directly related to the microscopic arrangements of the platelets in the dispersions . in the glassy phase , the interactions between platelets are dominated by screened coulomb repulsions and the viscoelasticity and yielding behaviors originate from the caging of each platelet by its neighbors @xcite .",
    "the gel phase , on the other hand , is a volume spanning network structure in which two platelets are connected by an attractive bond , with the strengths of the bonds determining their viscoelasticity and yielding behavior . +",
    "the nature of platelet association for attractive bond formation , and therefore the origin of the observed rheological behavior of na - montmorillonite gels , have been widely debated in the literature @xcite . based on the dlvo theory and rheological measurements in dispersions of low platelet concentrations , it was predicted that at low salt concentration and in a dispersing medium of ph@xmath2 , attractive bond formation occurs through the association of the negative faces of the platelets with their positive edges . on the other hand , bond formation through edge - face , face - face and edge - edge interactions",
    "are predicted at varying salt concentrations in a dispersing medium of ph@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the coagulation process becomes more complicated with increasing platelet concentration in the presence of salt and a house of cards ( hoc ) structure is frequently invoked to explain the nature of gel networks @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the experimental evidence of such predicted microstructures is very limited .",
    "there have been some studies to visualize the underlying microscopic structures using scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) @xcite and transmission x - ray microscopy ( txm ) @xcite for different conditions of sample preparation .",
    "these studies confirm the existence of either edge - edge or face - face microscopic configurations of platelets in the presence of salt .",
    "however , these studies do not systematically investigate the variation of the microscopic structures , and their influence on the strength and stability of clay gels , with changing salt concentration .    in this article",
    ", we address this issue by studying the rheology , stability properties and associated microstructures of 5% w / v na - montmorillonite dispersions at their natural ph values after systematically varying the externally added salt concentration from 10 mm to 800 mm .",
    "we find that the viscoelastic moduli and the yield stress of arrested phases ( gels ) in the dispersion increase upto a peak value at a critical salt concentration and subsequently decrease due to the progressive increase in salt induced interparticle attractive interactions .",
    "the microscopic association of the platelets in gels with varying salt concentration is directly visualized using cryogenic scanning electron microscope ( cryo - sem ) .",
    "this shows a transition of the gel morphology , dominated by overlapping coin ( oc ) and house of cards ( hoc ) associations of clay particles to a new network structure dominated by face - face coagulation of platelets , across the critical salt concentration .",
    "the variation of the strength of the gels estimated from the rheological measurements is then interpreted in terms of the observed microstructures and changes in gel morphology .",
    "the influence of the morphology on the stability of the gels under gravity is further assessed using electroacoustics .    besides their obvious rheological importance @xcite , clay colloids in aqueous dispersions have been studied extensively for their aging properties @xcite . the structure , dynamics and rheology of clay in water with and without salt have been widely debated @xcite .",
    "our present results , obtained for clay dispersions with a wide range of salt concentrations , will be useful to understand and predict many geophysical phenomena such as land slides , and the formation of river deltas and quicksand @xcite that are directly or indirectly related to the salt induced association of natural clay colloids .",

    "this keeps the sample from sticking to the flat surface of the probe .",
    "when the transducer launches a low power ( 10 mw ) nondestructive plane ultrasound wave of frequency 3 mhz along the height of the sample , it induces small oscillating dipole moments in the edls of the clay platelets suspended in the dispersion .",
    "the electric field , generated from these induced dipoles , in turn , induces a current known as the colloidal vibration current ( @xmath25 ) in the receiving transducer circuit of the probe . if the dispersion contains salt , the transducer simultaneously detects an ionic vibration current ( @xmath26 ) which arises due to the relative motion between the two ion species of the salt . in this case , the total electroacoustic signal ( @xmath27 ) is a vector sum of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",

    "<S> na - montmorillonite is a natural clay mineral and is available in abundance in nature . </S>",
    "<S> the aqueous dispersions of charged and anisotropic platelets of this mineral exhibit non - ergodic kinetically arrested states ranging from soft glassy phases dominated by interparticle repulsions to colloidal gels stabilized by salt induced attractive interactions . when the salt concentration in the dispersing medium is varied systematically , viscoelasticity and yield stress of the dispersion show non - monotonic behavior at a critical salt concentration , thus signifying a morphological change in the dispersion microstructures . </S>",
    "<S> we directly visualize the microscopic structures of these kinetically arrested phases using cryogenic scanning electron microscopy . </S>",
    "<S> we observe the existence of honeycomb - like network morphologies for a wide range of salt concentrations . </S>",
    "<S> the transition of the gel morphology , dominated by overlapping coin ( oc ) and house of cards ( hoc ) associations of clay particles at low salt concentrations to a new network structure dominated by face - face coagulation of platelets , is observed across the critical salt concentration . </S>",
    "<S> we further assess the stability of these gels under gravity using electroacoustics . </S>",
    "<S> this study , performed for concentrated clay dispersions for a wide concentration range of externally added salt , is useful in our understanding of many geophysical phenomena that involve the salt induced aggregation of natural clay minerals . </S>"
