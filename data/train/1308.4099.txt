    "the simplest model that can explain the apparent acceleration of the universe is the ` concordance ' @xmath0cdm model , with @xmath1 and zero spatial curvature @xmath2 .",
    "the concordance model is consistent with all observations to date  @xcite .",
    "current observations favour a dark energy model with equation of state @xmath3 , although there are modified gravity models with no dark energy that are also consistent with the data @xcite .",
    "next - generation experiments such as des @xcite , lsst @xcite , euclid @xcite and the ska @xcite , are expected to dramatically improve on current constraints and introduce new observables .",
    "it is typical to parametrize @xmath4 in order to differentiate between various dark energy models , or to parametrize background and perturbation variables to test classes of modified gravity models .",
    "a complementary approach is to test the consistency of the concordance model itself , independent of the values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "a range of null tests designed specifically to probe various aspects of the concordance model have been introduced ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite for a review ) .",
    "type ia supernovae ( snia ) are the best distance indicators to probe the expansion history of the universe .",
    "these ` standardizable candles ' can be observed to high redshift , and have produced convincing evidence that the universe has undergone a recent phase of accelerated expansion .",
    "current samples of snia ( e.g. @xcite ) comprise several hundred snia with @xmath7 .",
    "forthcoming surveys of snia , such as des @xcite , will produce well - measured light - curves for over 4000 snia , improving the cosmological constraints by an order of magnitude .",
    "in this paper we use luminosity distances @xmath8 determined from snia observations to test the consistency of the concordance model , through a set of null tests .",
    "reconstructing the expansion history of the universe in a model - independent fashion is essential for these tests . to do this",
    ", we use gaussian processes ( gp ) , which have previously been used to reconstruct @xmath4 from snia luminosity distances @xcite .",
    "our analysis is built on @xcite , which used @xmath9 data from the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) scale and galaxy ages to test the validity of the concordance model .",
    "we use gapp ( gaussian processes in python ) ] , a package developed by seikel and introduced in @xcite .",
    "the tests based on @xmath9 are potentially stronger discriminators of the concordance model than those using snia data , since the null tests using @xmath8 require higher derivative terms than those using @xmath9 .",
    "however , null tests based on direct distance measurements currently have the advantage that the data sets are much larger and the errors are smaller .",

    "this is integrated over to obtain the luminosity distances of snia : @xmath12 the equation of state parameter of dark energy , @xmath13 , can be expressed in terms of the dimensionless comoving luminosity distance , @xmath14 as @xcite : @xmath15d'\\big\\}/   \\\\ \\nonumber & & { } \\!\\!\\!\\ ! \\big\\{3\\{(1+z)^2[\\omega_{{k}}+(1+z)\\omega_{{m}}]d'^2-(1+\\omega_{{k}}d^2)\\}d'\\big\\}.   \\label{w}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    given an observed distance - redshift relationship @xmath16 , it is possible to reconstruct the equation of state of dark energy and test the @xmath0cdm model @xcite .",
    "however , a disadvantage of this method is that it depends on the values of the density parameters , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which must be measured independently @xcite .    to avoid this problem and test @xmath0cdm using snia data",
    ", we use the consistency tests introduced in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . following this approach , we test the null hypothesis that the expansion of the universe can be described by a flat or a curved @xmath0cdm model .",
    "the assumptions underlying the consistency tests and the null hypothesis are : ( 1 )  the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales ; ( 2 )  gravity obeys general relativity ; ( 3 )  the universe contains cold matter ( with @xmath17 ) and dark energy .",
    "photons and neutrinos can be included ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 are known independently , from cmb data ) , but it is reasonable to neglect radiation at the low redshifts probed by snia data .",
    "detection of a deviation from the consistency tests would imply a violation of at least one of these assumptions : ( 1 )  large - scale nonlinear inhomogeneity or anisotropy ; ( 2 )  modified gravity ; ( 3 )  dynamical dark energy ( @xmath20 ) , or alternatively , a cosmological constant plus an unknown additional species with equation of state which deviates from that of cold matter , curvature or vacuum energy .",
    "any of these possibilities imply that the standard @xmath0cdm is ruled out .",
    "note that the tests can not identify which of these possibilities applies .    for a flat concordance model , i.e. @xmath21 and @xmath22 , from we find that @xmath23d'^2=1-d'^2.\\ ] ] if we define @xmath24d'(z)^2 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then @xmath25 thus we obtain a null test of the concordance model : @xmath26 any variation of @xmath27 with redshift reflects an inconsistency between the flat @xmath0cdm model and observations .",
    "to detect evolution of @xmath28 with redshift we can differentiate @xmath27 , from which we define the additional diagnostic : @xmath29 d''(z ) \\nonumber\\\\              & ~~+3(1+z)^2d'(z ) \\left[1-d'(z)^2\\right]\\big\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which vanishes if and only if @xmath30 . the factor @xmath31 ( which was not used in @xcite ) , ensures stability of the errors ( see below ) .",
    "if @xmath32 is nonzero at any redshift , then observations are incompatible with @xmath0cdm : @xmath33    we can extend this approach to include spatial curvature , and derive null tests for general ( curved ) @xmath0cdm . using , and with @xmath34 , and solving for @xmath5 and @xmath6 , we find  @xcite : @xmath35d ''   \\nonumber \\\\   & ~~ - \\left ( d'^2 -1 \\right )   \\left [ ( 1+z)d ' -d \\right ] \\big\\}\\equiv \\mathcal{o}_m^{(2)}(z),\\\\ \\label{okwhole } \\omega_{{k } } & ~= \\upsilon(z)\\big\\ { 2\\left [ 1-(1+z ) ^{3}\\right]d '' \\nonumber\\\\   & ~~ + 3d'\\left(d'^2 - 1\\right ) ( 1+z)^{2 } \\big\\}\\equiv \\mathcal{o}_{{k}}(z).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath36 is defined by @xmath37   d^2 d '' \\nonumber\\\\   & ~ -\\big\\ {   ( 1+z)\\left [   ( 1+z)^{3}-3 ( 1+z)+2 \\right ]   d'^{2 } \\nonumber\\\\   & ~ -2\\left [ 1- ( 1+z)^{3 } \\right ] dd ' -3(1+z)^{2}d^{2 } \\big\\}d'.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then we have @xmath38    these are not independent tests : the derivative of @xmath39 vanishes if and only if the derivative of @xmath40 vanishes . hence we need only a single diagnostic for vanishing derivative .",
    "we use the derivative of @xmath40 to define @xmath41 + 9(1+z)^2d^2d''^2    \\nonumber\\\\   & ~ + 3(1+z)d^2d ' \\big(2d '' -(1+z)d'''\\big )   \\nonumber\\\\   & ~ +   6(1+z)^2d'^2 \\left(d'^2 - 1 \\right)-\\big[3z^2(3+z)d''^2    \\nonumber\\\\ & ~   + zd'\\big(z(3+z)d ' '' - 6(2+z)d''\\big)\\big](1+z)\\big\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which vanishes if and only if @xmath42 .",
    "( again we use the pre - factor to stabilize the errors . )",
    "then we have the null test for curved @xmath0cdm : @xmath43    in principle , @xmath32 and @xmath44 provide no additional information compared to @xmath28 and @xmath40 .",
    "however , it is easier to detect a deviation from zero than to confirm that a quantity is constant , especially since the exact value of this constant is not known a priori .",
    "the disadvantage of @xmath32 and @xmath44 is that they require higher derivatives than @xmath28 and @xmath40 , which are more challenging to constrain .",
    "another problem with @xmath32 and @xmath44 is the degeneracy between @xmath45 and @xmath46 : a model with redshift dependent @xmath45 can be formally consistent with @xmath0cdm within the error bars of the reconstruction if the value of @xmath46 is adjusted accordingly .",
    "such cases can only be identified with the @xmath47 tests , but not with @xmath48 ( see section [ discussion ] for details ) .",
    "note that @xmath32 and @xmath44 are not identical to @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "starting from these two derivatives , we have neglected the denominators , which add significant noise to the tests without adding extra information , and used a pre - factor @xmath31 to obtain @xmath32 and @xmath44 .",
    "we are free to do this without loss of generality , since we are testing the equality of these quantities with zero . as a consequence",
    ", the error bands of the reconstructions do not necessarily increase with redshift as one might expect , and the size of the errors of @xmath32 and @xmath44 are not directly comparable . in addition , the errors added from extra redshift factors are small when we have spectroscopic redshift measurements .",
    "to apply these null tests using current datasets , it is essential to choose a model - independent method to reconstruct @xmath16 and its derivatives . for this purpose ,",
    "we use gp ( via the gapp code @xcite ) to smooth the data and reconstruct the derivatives .",
    "gp provide a distribution over functions that are suitable to describe the data . at each point @xmath51 ,",
    "the distribution of function values @xmath52 is a gaussian .",
    "thus the reconstruction consists of a mean function with gaussian error bands .",
    "the function values at different points are correlated by a covariance function @xmath53 , which depends on a set of hyperparameters ( e.g.  the characteristic length scale @xmath54 and the signal variance @xmath55 ) .",
    "this also provides a robust way to estimate derivatives of the function in a stable manner .",
    "in contrast to parametric methods , gp do not assume a specific form for the reconstructed function . instead only typical changes of the function are considered .",
    "the hyperparameter @xmath54 corresponds roughly to the distance one needs to move in input space before the function value changes significantly , while @xmath55 describes typical changes in the function value .",
    "the choice of covariance function affects the reconstruction to some extent .",
    "a general purpose covariance function is the squared exponential covariance function @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "however , here we use the matrn ( @xmath57 ) covariance function : @xmath58 .",
    "\\label{mat}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for a given covariance function , the probability distribution of the hyperparameters depends only on the data .",
    "it is necessary either to marginalize over the hyperparameters @xmath55 and @xmath54 , or to fix the hyperparameters to their maximum likelihood values .",
    "here we choose the latter approach , which is a good approximation and computationally much less expensive than marginalization .",
    "we choose the matrn ( @xmath57 ) covariance function because it leads to the most reliable results amongst the covariance functions that we have tested . here",
    ", `` reliable '' means the following : for various assumed cosmological models and many realizations of mock data sets , the assumed model _ on average _ lies within the reconstructed 1-@xmath59 limits for approximately 68% of the redshift range ( and within the reconstructed 2-@xmath59 limits for @xmath60% of the redshift range ) .",
    "these values are theoretically expected , thus making matrn ( @xmath57 ) a reliable covariance function for our purposes . a detailed analysis regarding the optimal choice of covariance function",
    "can be found in @xcite .",
    "( note that these results only apply to gp reconstructions using @xmath61 measurements . when applying gp to other data",
    ", another covariance function might be more reliable . )",
    "we follow @xcite , which contain a summary of the technical details of gp .",
    "the only difference in our approach here is that we use the matrn covariance function instead of the squared exponential .",
    "( for detailed reviews of gp , see @xcite . )",
    "we now apply gp to the union 2.1 dataset @xcite and determine the current constraints on the consistency of @xmath0cdm .",
    "this data set comprises @xmath62 snia , with @xmath63 , and includes a covariance matrix which incorporates a systematic uncertainty .",
    "the distance modulus , @xmath64 , is the difference between the observed magnitude  @xmath65 and the absolute magnitude of an object  @xmath66 , and is given by @xmath67 .",

    "note that @xmath70 and @xmath66 are degenerate in so we can fix @xmath70 and only consider the uncertainties in @xmath66 which are included in the covariance matrix of the union 2.1 dataset  @xcite   this includes the errors on @xmath70 .",
    "we convert @xmath71 to @xmath61 and add the theoretical values @xmath72 and @xmath73 to the data set .",

    "the near - constancy of the errors on @xmath78 reflect the fact that we are unable to constrain rapid variations ( carried via higher derivatives ) on scales below a typical length scale , which is roughly associated with @xmath54 . by using gaussian processes the scale @xmath54 and the resulting smoothness of the reconstruction",
    "is driven purely by the data . where there is insufficient _ evidence _ for rapid variations , a smooth function will result , which we see in the second and third derivatives .",
