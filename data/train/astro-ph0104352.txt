    "the quasar pg1211 + 143 ( @xmath4 ; marziani et al . 1996 ) is one of the prototypes of agn with particularly strong hard optical spectrum and profound steep soft x ",
    "ray emission ( elvis , wilkes , & tananbaum 1985 ) .",
    "it has been frequently argued that the optical / uv and soft x  ray emission form a single big blue bump component which extends across the unobserved xuv band ( bechtold et al .",
    "1987 ) , and strongly dominates the bolometric luminosity .",
    "however , the nature of the soft x  ray emission  in particular , the spectral component that exhibits a very soft spectrum and often is seen in many quasars and seyfert 1 galaxies only below @xmath5 kev  is still not determined unambiguously .",
    "there are arguments both in favor and against the origin of this emission component being the tail of the optical / uv big blue bump .",
    "this is because any interpretation relies on extrapolating the spectrum over a decade in frequency through the unobserved xuv band .",
    "the strong arguments in favor of the big blue bump ( bbb ) extending up to the soft x  ray range are statistical in their nature .",
    "there is a strong , almost linear correlation between the luminosity of an object at 2500    and the soft x ",
    "ray luminosity in the rosat spectral band both in a large sample of seyfert 1 galaxies ( walter & fink 1993 ) and in radio quiet quasars ( yuan et al . 1998 ) suggesting a relatively uniform spectral shape of the bbb .",
    "spectral analysis of both high redshift and low redshift quasars ( laor et al .",
    "1997 ) allowed for a `` shrinking '' of the unobserved band and such spectra appear to cover smoothly the entire optical / uv / soft x ",
    "ray band .",
    "arguments against the soft x ",
    "ray emission being a direct tail of the optical / uv component are also mostly statistical .",
    "it is rather surprising from the theoretical point of view why the extension of the bbb should be the same in all objects having a range of black hole masses and luminosities .",
    "instead , it was suggestive of some atomic processes ( e.g. czerny & .",
    "zycki 1994 ) .",
    "also the normalized variability amplitude in the uv band is usually smaller than in the x  ray band ( see e.g. ulrich et al .",
    ". a close look at the uv spectra of some sources frequently suggests a slight decline on @xmath6 diagram in the far uv ( malkan 1983 ; magdziarz et al .",
    "1998 for ngc  5548 ) .",
    "this does not really allow for this component to extend far enough into xuv range to make it observable in the soft x  ray band , even if a certain amount of unsaturated comptonization is taken into account .",

    "the optical / uv spectrum of this source was determined by bechtold et al .",

    "we study the short timescale variability in the hard and soft x ",
    "ray bands on the basis of the longest sequence from asca ( june 3 - 4 , 1993 , @xmath19 s ) , and accompanying rosat ( june 2 - 4 , 1993 , @xmath20 s ) .",
    "we analyzed the asca lightcurve binned into 128 s bins for two sis and two gis instruments separately , in the entire energy band .",
    "as an example , we show the gis-2 lightcurve in figure  [ fig : asca_lc ] .",
    "= 80 mm    the source is clearly variable in both energy bands .",
    "the rms amplitude in asca and rosat bands are given in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "such values are comparable to those measured in x",
    " rays in other agn , e.g. 16% in mcg6 - 30 - 15 on timescales shorter than @xmath21 s ( nowak & chiang 2000 ) .",
    "the count rate in asca is dominated by 1 - 2 kev energy band , where both the contribution of the soft x  ray excess and hard x  ray power law are important .",
    "we therefore compared the rms value derived above with the rms value measured from the light curve for photons above 2 kev .",
    "we used only the data from gis instruments as those data are more reliable for time - series analysis than sis data for pg 1211 + 143 .",
    "this is because the pg 1211 + 143 asca observation was conducted in a 4-ccd mode of the sis instrument , and the source image fell close to the gap between the ccd chips .",
    "since the satellite attitude can change somewhat during the observation , some unknown fraction of photons may fall in the space between the chips , resulting in an apparent but erroneous variability .",
    "both gis2 light curves ( whole energy band , and above 2 kev ) were rebinned into 512 s bins to increase statistics ; the two observations yield rms values of 0.095 and 0.171 , respectively .",
    "this suggests that the observed variations at the time scales of minutes - hours are predominantly due to the hard x  ray power law .",
    "this is confirmed by the fact that rms value measured in the rosat band is much smaller during the 40 ksec observation than in the asca data .",
    "the data from asca and rosat satellites are exactly simultaneous ; nonetheless , the presence of gaps due to the earth occultation of the source makes an attempt to use the fourier analysis rather difficult , although there are methods which allow to overcome this problem for high quality observations ( e.g. done et al .",
    "however , even the available asca data are not of sufficient quality to perform this kind of analysis .",
    "therefore , here we adopt a complementary method based on a nonlinear prediction , which is described in czerny & lehto ( 1997 ) .",
    "we analyzed the light curve binned into 128 s bins for two sis and two gis instruments separately , in the entire energy band .",
    "such analysis reveals that the shape of the power density spectrum ( hereafter pds ) is basically described as a power law , with the slope 1.5 .",
    "errors in determination of those values are substantial , and systematic errors dominate , since the existence of the signal in the data is marginal ( the correlation coefficient itself is 0.62 and 0.67 , i.e. below 0.8 , which would be necessary for reliable results ) .    such a value of the pds slope is typical for seyfert galaxies at high frequencies . yaqoob ( 1997 ) obtained the high frequency slope of mcg6 - 30 - 15 of 1.4 , edelson & nandra ( 1999 ) determined the slope to be 1.74 in ngc  3516 at frequencies above @xmath22 hz , and nowak & chiang ( 2000 ) as well as chiang et al .",
    "( 2000 ) give the slope of 1.0 at intermediate frequencies and a slope of 2.0 at high frequencies in mcg6 - 30 - 15 and ngc  5548 , respectively .",
    "= 80 mm    we conclude that the variability properties of pg1211 + 143 are rather typical of a seyfert galaxy .",
    "unfortunately , neither quasars nor narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies were studied with equal accuracy as normal seyfert 1 galaxies , so it is not known whether there are any systematic differences in variability apart from scaling with mass ( e.g. leighly 1999 ; piasecki et al .",
    "results for pg1211 + 143 may indicate that the variability pattern is universal .",

    "the rosat observations cover a period of 1.5 years , allowing for a reliable measurement with the same instrument .",
    "we determine the observed fluxes in 0.2 - 2 kev band assuming a simple spectral model of a broken power law , with the second ( hard x  ray ) power law photon index fixed at 2.0 and the galactic absorption fixed at the assumed value as given above .",
    "the rosat sequences @xmath29 and @xmath30 obtained on the same day were both fitted separately and combined ( see table  [ tab3 ] ) . since",
    "the errors in separate fits are large , we use only the combined set in further analysis .",
    "all flux measurements are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the variability during the period of rosat observations is moderate , roughly by a factor 2 .",
    "more precisely , the rms value measured on the timescale of @xmath26 s is only 0.25 , which is not much higher than the rms variability on short time scales , within a single asca data set .",
    "however , at the timescales of years the trend reverses , and the soft x  ray variability amplitude becomes higher than the hard x  ray variability on the same time scale . analyzing the entire period of twenty years of observations , we measure the rms in 0.2 - 2 kev band which is higher than in 2 - 10 kev band ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "it is consistent with the trends shown by the big blue bump in other agn ( e.g. clavel et al .",
    "1992 for ngc  5548 and clavel , wamsteker & glass 1989 for fairall  9 ) .",
    "the most dramatic change happened during the end of 1985/beginning of 1986 but this period is covered by only 3 exosat observations ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "large changes in the soft x  ray emission are accompanied by the changes in the hard x  ray flux but not with comparable amplitude ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "since the analysis of asca data allows us to estimate the slope of the pds at high frequencies , we can reconstruct the total pds from the values of rms on time scales of @xmath31 s and @xmath32 s. we assume the slope of 1.5 at high frequencies and a slope 0.0 below certain frequency @xmath33 . using the integral conditions connecting the pds and rms at a given frequency ( see e.g. czerny , schwarzenberg - czerny , & loska 1999 ) we obtain the flattening frequency @xmath34 hz , corresponding to a timescale of @xmath35 s. this is again comparable to the results for most seyfert galaxies : the flat part of the pds starts at timescales @xmath36 s for mcg6 - 30 - 15 ( nowak & chiang 2000 ) , @xmath37 s for ngc  5548 ( chiang et al .",

    "convenient and powerful method based on the normalization of the high frequency tail of the power density spectrum was recently developed by hayashida et al . ( 1998 ) and hayashida ( 2000 ) .",
    "here we use a modified version of this method ( piasecki et al .",
    "2000 ) which is based on comparison of the shape of the pds with independent mass determination for the seyfert 1 ngc  5548 , an agn ; for the purpose of the mass estimate , this is likely to be more appropriate than scaling the normalization of cyg x-1 , an accreting binary system , used in hayashida et al .",
    "the data discussed in previous section are not of sufficient quality to perform fourier analysis . however , having the rms determined for a few time scales , we can reconstruct the power density spectrum assuming its shape in advance and using the integral connection between the power density spectrum and rms ( see e.g. czerny et al .",
    "1999 ) .    here",
    "we assume that the pds is flat below certain frequency and has a slope 1.5 above it , as determined in section  [ sect : short ] .",
    "as data points for this method , we use the gis rms measurement for the @xmath24 s time scale and multi - instrument measurements on the @xmath39 s time scales .",
    "extension of the measurements afforded by the rxte observations only confirms that the break frequency is at timescales below @xmath38 s ; if this timescale is above @xmath38 s , the rms would saturate . with this",
    ", we determine the break frequency to be at @xmath40 hz , corresponding to timescales of @xmath41 s. the error on this value is large , since the uncertainty of the gis rms measurement is already a factor 5 .",
    "this simple approach gives the value of the black hole mass log@xmath42 = 7.0 @xmath43 0.7 [ @xmath44 , if the error in determination of the rms in gis data ( 0.3 ) is taken into account .",
    "the mass of pg1211 + 143 is thus definitely rather small for a quasar , and more typical for seyfert galaxies .",

    "all this implies that taking the systematic errors into account , all measurements are roughly consistent with each other , even though they are highly inaccurate .",

    "since the comptonized component contains a significant fraction of the bolometric luminosity ( @xmath172 % ) , much larger than the fraction contained in the hard x  ray part ( up to @xmath142 % ) the comptonizing medium can not be heated by hard x  rays .",
    "for this reason , the discrepancy between the results quoted above and the large optical depth determined from our fits is not surprising .",
    "the dissipation must occur within this zone and we can attempt to compare the required amount of heating with most popular parametric prescription for the viscous dissipation of gravitational energy .",

    "it does not explain the physical mechanism behind the heating but clearly indicates that @xmath1 scaling is a good phenomenological description of the process .",
    "there are two major consequences of the scaling favored by our analysis for the dissipation : disk instability and surface temperature gradient .",
    "the disk models are known to be unstable under such scaling if the radiation pressure dominates , as it is the case in disks in active galaxies ( pringle , rees , & pacholczyk 1973 ; ligthman & eardley 1974 ) .",

    "moreover , any strong outflow is known to suppress the outburst amplitude , if the outflow is coupled to the temporary local accretion rate ( janiuk et al .",
    "2000 ) , and any irregularities in this outflow lead immediately to much more complex lightcurve than simple predictions would indicate ( nayakshin , rappaport , & melia 2000 ) .",
    "in addition , if the viscosity parameter depends on the amount of the radiation pressure , the amplitude of the outburst can be reduced .",
    "testing such scenarios is more promising in case of galactic sources because of the shorter timescalesrequired .",
    "another aspect of the scenario that may present a conflict with observations is connected with the broadly discussed issue of the lack of lyman edge in the observed spectra of agn while the presence of such an edge is predicted by most models of accretion disk atmospheres ( for a review , see koratkar & blaes 1999 ) .",
    "those studies , however , never included such a strong heating close to the surface as well as the accompanying comptonization .",
    "strong heating leads to a more isothermal atmosphere , as already argued by laor & netzer ( 1989 ) , and comptonization is also quite efficient in removing the edge , as stressed by czerny & zbyszewska ( 1991 ) .",
    "some of the recent papers already made a step towards reducing the predicted edge (",
    "r ' o. za ' nska et al .",
    "1999 ; madej & r ' o. za ' nska 2000a ; hubeny & hubeny 1998 ) but most likely the issue can not be fully resolved until heating is properly included in computations of the disk atmosphere .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy in soft x ",
    "ray band available now through _ chandra _ and xmm data may provide an independent test of the physical conditions in the reflecting / comptonizing warm skin .",
    "this region is not completely ionized so it is a source of intense emission lines , mostly of the hydrogen - like ly@xmath185 lines from cno as well as si , mg , s and ne .",
    "the presence of such lines has been possibly detected in the mcg6 - 30 - 15 spectrum taken with the xmm ( branduardi - raymont et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "computations of the irradiated slab predict the existence of such lines ( ross , fabian , & young 1999 ) .",
    "dumont et al .",
    "( 2000 ) performed the radiative transfer in an irradiated slab under constant pressure , with the spectral slope of the incident radiation @xmath192 and the high energy cut - off of 100 kev . in this case the equivalent width of the ly@xmath185 cvi , nvii and oviii lines were equal to 1.6 ev , 2.3 ev and 7.4 ev for the ionization parameter @xmath83 ( at the surface ) of 300 , and 1.3 ev , 2.8 ev and 11.5 ev for @xmath193 .",
    "those values are quite similar to the ew measured in the x  ray spectrum of mcg6 - 30 - 15 ( branduardi - raymont et al .",
    "however , since in those considerations the slab was only radiatively heated from the outside , the high temperature zone was relatively thin ( thompson depth of 0.1 and 0.3 , correspondingly ) .",
    "the optical depth of the comptonizing medium determined by the data was on the order of 10 . with this , it is difficult to predict if the additional heating in the interior of the warm skin interior may change these results .",
    "on the other hand , the theoretical computations performed for a constant density irradiated medium , with harder incident flux ( @xmath194 , extending up to 280 kev ) indicated much larger ew , of order of 50 ev for @xmath193 ( czerny & dumont 1998 ) which suggests that ew of the soft x ",
    "ray lines is sensitive to the structure of the warm skin .",
    "clearly , more detailed theoretical studies together with observational constraints on the line intensity and its profiles may help to resolve the problem of the formation of such warm skin .",
    "the models should include both the effect of comptonization and kinematical / gravitational broadening of the line profiles , as both processes lead to development of red wings in emission lines , and may be difficult to differentiate .",
    "the narrow line quasar pg1211 + 143 is considered to be a very good candidate to study the broad band emission and variability properties due to a rich sample of observational data available for this object . in this work",
    ", we considered the physical mechanisms which may be responsible for the optical , uv and x  ray emission and variability of this source , and we found that the following model can give a satisfactory explanation of the observations :    * the central object powering the source is a supermassive black hole with a mass @xmath195 and the luminosity to eddington luminosity ratio is in the range of 5 - 40 % . despite large errors both quantities are consistent with the explanation of the phenomenon of narrow line seyfert galaxies based on a relatively low mass of the black hole and a high accretion rate .",
    "* the emitted radiation originates in the cold accretion disk responsible for the optical / uv spectrum .",
    "inner disk region develops a warm , optically thick skin , which produces the profound `` soft excess '' observed in the x  ray spectrum and is well modeled with a comptonized black body emission .",
    "however , from the spectral analysis alone , it can not be determined whether the source of seed photons for comptonization is the cold accretion disk or a somewhat hotter plasma , and both explanations are possible . *",
    "the warm disk skin is also responsible for the reflection of hard x ",
    "rays , which are emitted in the accretion disk corona .",
    "the latter has the form of active flares rather than forming a continuous medium . * both accretion disk and its warm skin are heated by the viscous dissipation process , which can be parameterized by @xmath1 prescription .",
    "this may lead to the source luminosity variations resulting from the presence of regions where the radiation pressure is dominant .",
    "* measurements of the soft x  ray emission lines possible in the _ chandra _ and xmm data and their comparison with theoretical models may help to test the warm skin structure .",
