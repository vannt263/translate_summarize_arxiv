    "in february 1997 , the italian - dutch satellite _ bepposax _ enabled a breakthrough in the understanding of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) by providing an accurate position for the prompt x - ray emission of a grb .",
    "this led to the discovery of the first x - ray afterglow of a grb ( costa et al .",
    "1997 ) , and , independently , to the identification of the first optical counterpart of a burster ( van paradijs et al .",
    "since then , several x - ray , optical and radio counterparts of grbs have been detected .",
    "these multi - wavelength afterglow observations can be explained reasonably well by simple fireball models ( for recent reviews see piran 1999 , and van paradijs , kouveliotou & wijers 2000 ) .",
    "grb distance determinations are crucial in the effort to establish the physical nature of their progenitor(s ) .",
    "the observed redshift distribution of the ` normal ' afterglows ( i.e. , excluding grb980425 , which is associated with supernova sn1998bw at z = 0.0085 ; galama et al .",
    "1998 ) , ranges from @xmath2 = 0.43 ( galama et al . 1999 , and this paper ) to @xmath2 = 3.42 ( kulkarni et al . 1998 ) .",
    "although major advances in the understanding of grbs have been made over the past few years ( thanks to the detection of afterglows ) , the physical nature of their progenitor(s ) remains unclear .",
    "the most popular models are ( i ) the collapse of a rotating massive star ( woosley 1993 , macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) and ( ii ) the merging of two neutron stars , or a neutron star and a black hole ( narayan , paczyski & piran 1992 , janka et al .",
    "the former ( ` collapsar ' ) model has trouble producing grbs with durations shorter than a couple of seconds and predicts that every afterglow is accompanied by a supernova of a type ( ic ) similar to sn1998bw ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) .",
    "furthermore , in the collapsar environment it is likely that the optical light of the afterglow is heavily absorbed by the surrounding dusty medium . given the massive progenitors , one expects the frequency of grbs to be strongly correlated with the cosmic star formation rate ; the latter remains one of the great unresolved issues in astronomy of today .",
    "the compact star merger scenario can make short grbs as well as long ones ( although a 10@xmath12 g magnetic field is probably needed for the latter , see mszros 2000 ) ; some of these mergers are expected to occur in low - density environments , possibly located several kiloparsec outside their host galaxies .",
    "this is due to the large kick velocities imparted to the compact objects from the two respective supernovae ( @xmath13 250  300 km s@xmath5 ; hansen & phinney 1997 ) , combined with the long time between the birth of the system and the merger occurrence ( 10@xmath14  10@xmath15 years ; portegies zwart & yungelson 1998 ) .",
    "consequently , since the optical afterglow brightness depends on the density of the circumsource medium , some of these bursts may not show an afterglow at all .",
    "these could account for the ` dark ' burst population , i.e. bursts for which only x - ray afterglows have been found .",
    "one way to discriminate between these two models is by studying the immediate environment of the burst . in the collapsar model",
    "the circumsource density is expected to drop with distance as r@xmath16 , due to the expanding stellar wind of the sn progenitor , while in the binary merger scenario a constant , relatively low - density ambient medium is most plausible .",
    "if the grb source resides in a compact , gas - rich environment ( which is expected in the collapsar scenario ) , the afterglow spectrum might show time - dependent absorption features ( such as ly@xmath17 and mgii ) due to the gradual ionization of the surrounding medium ( perna & loeb 1998 ) . in this case a decrease of the absorption - line equivalent widths ( ews ) with time is expected . on the other hand ,",
    "spectroscopic observations of the star hd 72089 , situated behind the vela supernova remnant , show an increase of an order of magnitude of the absorption strengths of elements such as al and fe , over the velocity range spanned by absorption in the remnant ( jenkins & wallerstein 1995 ; see also savage & sembach 1996 ) .",
    "this is attributed to the destruction of the dust grains , due to the propagation of the sn shock , which causes the release of elements ( such as fe and mg ) that are frozen in the dust .",
    "thus in a dusty environment that is being ` shocked ' by a grb explosion , one might expect the strength of the absorption lines to increase in time .    in order to test these theories of grb genesis , and the effects of grbs on their environments",
    ", we have an on - going program to obtain spectra of grb afterglows using the _ very large telescope _ ( vlt ) of the european southern observatory ( eso ) at paranal , chile . here",
    "we present results on two of these bursts : grb990510 and grb990712 .",

    "the spectra of the other nights were flux - calibrated with a spectrophotometric standard star , which resulted in flux levels that are consistent with the photometry at the same epochs .    to flux - calibrate the spectrum of grb990510 , we fitted the light curves with a smoothly connected broken - power - law model ( harrison et al . 1999 , stanek et al . 1999 ,",

    "the e(b - v ) value is translated into an extinction at a given wavelength using the standard galactic extinction curve of cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) .",

    "hjorth et al . ( 2000 ) suggested that the host galaxy of grb990712 may be a seyfert 2 galaxy on the basis of the [ oiii ] 5007/h@xmath10 ratio being greater than three ( see shuder & osterbrock 1981 ) , and its location in the log([oiii ] 5007/h@xmath10 ) vs. log([oii]/[oiii ] 5007 ) diagram ( see fig . 2 of baldwin , phillips & terlevich 1981 ) .",

    "4 of rola et al .",
    "1997 shows all definite seyfert 2s have c@xmath49c@xmath51 0.4 ) , i.e. the emission lines are produced by hii regions that are being ionized by o and b stars .",
    "we conclude grb990712 is most likely an hii galaxy , and not a seyfert 2 .",
    "we have estimated the host galaxy extinction , by comparing the observed ratio of h@xmath25/h@xmath10 ( 0.26 @xmath3 0.09 ) with the expected ratio for case b recombination ( 0.469 @xmath3 0.009 ; osterbrock 1989 ) . using the galactic extinction curve of cardelli et al .",

    "for all these estimates a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) has been assumed . combining equation ( 3 ) of kennicutt ( 1998 ) , a luminosity distance of 6.8 @xmath21 10@xmath52 cm ( taking h@xmath28 = 70 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , @xmath29=0.3 , and @xmath30=0 ) , and the [ oii ] 3727 line flux from table [ tab:712lines ] (",
    "the fluxes in this table have already been corrected for galactic extinction ) we obtain sfr([oii ] ) = 2.7 @xmath3 0.8 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 , consistent with the value found by hjorth et al .",

    "1989 ) , we find sfr([oii ] ) = @xmath8 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 . using equation ( 2 ) of kennicutt ( 1998 ) , the case b ( large optical depth ) line ratio _ j_@xmath53/_j_@xmath54 of 2.85 ( osterbrock 1989 ) and the h@xmath10 flux of table [ tab:712lines ] , we find sfr(h@xmath10 ) 1.7 @xmath3 0.6 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 .",
    "corrected for reddening , this becomes sfr(h@xmath10 ) = @xmath55 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 .",

    "( 1998 ) , combined with the 2800   flux ( which is located at 4013   at a redshift of 0.4331 ) , gives sfr(2800  ) = 2.8 @xmath3 0.9 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 , which becomes @xmath13 400 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 , using a@xmath6 = 3.4 .",
    "the [ oii ] method , although it is indirectly calibrated through h@xmath17 and sensitive to the abundance and ionization state of the gas , is probably the least uncertain of the three .",
    "the h@xmath10 estimate is uncertain due to the unknown host galaxy stellar absorption underneath the emission .",
    "the sfr based on the ultra - violet continuum is very uncertain due to the fact that our flux calibration is an extrapolation below the v band , and , more importantly , the extinction correction at ultra - violet wavelengths is very uncertain .",
    "normally , the 2800   sfr is found to be lower by a factor of 23 ( at redshifts up to @xmath2 = 2.8 ) as compared to the h@xmath17 luminosity sfr method ( glazebrook et al . 1999 ,",
    "yan et al . 1999 ) .",
    "for the grb host galaxies for which a sfr has been determined so far , even for the [ oii ] method alone , the values range from 0.5 @xmath3 0.15 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 ( grb970228 ; djorgovski et al .",
    "1999a ) to 20 @xmath3 9 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 ( grb980703 ; djorgovski et al . 1998 ) ; host galaxy extinction is not included , so these values should be considered as lower limits .",
    "normalized by the host b band luminosity , this range is narrowed down to spread a factor of three . it has been noted ( e.g. djorgovski et al .",
    "1998 ) , that the range of sfrs for grb host galaxies does not seem to be extra - ordinarily high , as compared to field galaxies at similar redshifts .",
    "e.g. glazebrook et al .",
    "( 1999 ) find a range of 20 - 60 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 ( using h@xmath17 ) , for 13 field galaxies at @xmath2 = 1 , drawn from the cfrs .",
    "however , the galaxies at high redshifts for which these rates have been measured tend to be much brighter than the typical grb host galaxy , and are therefore expected to have much higher sfrs .",
    "the [ oii ] equivalent width , which effectively is the star formation rate normalized by the blue band luminosity of the host galaxy , allows a more useful comparison . the mean @xmath35([oii ] ) of the glazebrook et al .",
    "sample is 33 with a standard deviation of 15  , while we measure @xmath35([oii ] ) = 46 @xmath3 1   for the host of grb990712 .",
    "this comparison also suggests that grb990712 occurred in a galaxy that is vigorously forming stars .    using the oxygen and h@xmath10 emission lines",
    ", we can estimate the global oxygen abundance of the host of grb990712 ( see kobulnicky , kennicutt & pizagno 1999 , and references therein ) . from the values in table [ tab:712lines ] we obtain @xmath56 , corresponding to log(o / h ) = 3.7 @xmath3 0.4 ( we note that log(o / h)@xmath4 = 3.1 ; cox et al .",
    "this estimate is based on fluxes not corrected for reddening , but such a correction would not change the abundance estimate substantially . for comparison : the oxygen abundances for a sample of 22 relatively nearby spiral galaxies range from log(o / h ) = 2.7 to 3.5 ( kobulnicky , kennicutt & pizagno 1999 ) .",
    "it is now well established that grbs are the most energetic events in the universe , with peak isotropic luminosities up to 10@xmath57 erg s@xmath5 ( kulkarni et al . 1998 ) . also when the radiation from grbs is beamed , the impact of the shock on the circumburst material is the same as in an isotropic explosion , and could be observable as time - resolved evolution of the fe k@xmath17 line and edge in the x - ray regime ( weth et al .",
    "1999 , and references therein ) and of ultra - violet ( uv ) absorption lines , redshifted to the optical domain ( perna & loeb 1998 ) . by monitoring the line evolution it is possible to obtain",
    "information on the density structure surrounding the explosion , and  in case the density can be measured by an independent method ",
    "the redshift to the burst may be obtained ( perna & loeb 1998 ) .",
    "our spectral observations of the afterglows of grb990510 and grb990712 extend over several nights , and both contain absorption lines , so that we can look for possible temporal evolution of these features .",
    "they are expected to decrease in time , if a considerable fraction of the atoms responsible for the absorption are in the vicinity of the site of the burst , and are ionized by the explosion ( perna & loeb 1998 ) .",
    "alternatively , the burst may release atoms that are locked in the dust , which could result in a corresponding increase of the ews .",
    "the clearest absorption feature in both bursts is mgii . in the may 11 and may 14 spectra of grb990510 ( 0.8 and 3.9 days after the burst , respectively ) , we measure @xmath35 = 2.6 @xmath3 0.4   ( may 11 ) and @xmath35 = 2.3 @xmath3 0.6   ( may 14 ) . for grb990712",

    "the values are constant within the errors .",
    "this is not very surprising ; the mgii feature is most likely saturated in the spectra of both bursts .",
    "this means that over a wide range of column densities , the ew is not expected to change by a detectable amount . on the other hand ,",
    "a significant change in the ew would have indicated a large change in the column density .",
