    "it is widely accepted that the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars is dominated by a non - thermal continuum , produced within a relativistic jet closely aligned with the line of sight , making these objects very good laboratories to study the physics of relativistic jets .",
    "the overall emission , from radio to @xmath2rays and , in some cases , to the multi  tev band , shows the presence of two well  defined broad components ( von montigny et al .",
    "1995 ; fossati et al . 1998 ) . usually , for the blazars that are detected in the tev bands , the first components peaks in the uv  soft - x  ray bands ( hbl : high energy peaked blazars , padovani & giommi ( 1995 ) and the second one in the gev ",
    "tev region .",
    "the blazar emission is very successfully interpreted so far in the framework of synchrotron inverse compton models .",
    "the lower energy peak is unanimously attributed to synchrotron emission by relativistic electrons in the jet , while the second component is commonly believed to be inverse compton emission ( ic ) from the same electron population ( e.g. , ghisellini et al .",
    "1998 ) , although different scenarios have been proposed ( e.g. bttcher 2007 ) .    since the discovery of the first blazar emitting tev radiation , mrk  421 ( punch et al . 1992 ) , tev blazars have been the target of intense observational and theoretical investigations .",
    "indeed , the possibility of coupling observations of the emission produced by very high energy electrons , in the vhe ( very high energy ) band ( up to lorentz factors of the order of @xmath3 ) , with observations in the soft and hard x  ray bands offers a unique tool to probe the cooling and acceleration processes of relativistic particles .",
    "in fact the synchrotron peak of these sources is usually located in the soft x  ray , while it is in the hard x  ray band that the synchrotron emission by the most energetic electrons can be studied and that the low energy part of the compton emission component can start to dominate .",
    "studies conducted simultaneously in the soft and hard x  ray and in the vhe bands are of particular importance , since in the simple synchrotron - self compton ( ssc ) framework one expects that variations in x  rays and tev should be closely correlated , being produced by the same electrons ( e.g. tavecchio et al .",
    "in fact even the first observations at x  ray and tev energies yielded significant evidence of correlated and simultaneous variability of the tev and x  ray fluxes ( buckley et al .",
    "1996 ; catanese et al .",
    "1997 ) . during the x - ray / tev 1998 campaign on mrk421",
    "a rapid flare was detected both at x  ray and tev energies ( maraschi et al .",
    "subsequent observations confirmed these first evidences also in other sources .",
    "note however that the correlation seems to be violated in some cases , as indicated by the observation of an `` orphan '' ( i.e. not accompanied by a corresponding x  ray flare ) tev event in 1es 1959 + 650 ( krawczynski et al . 2004 ) . in the case of pks2155 - 304 a giant tev flare recorded by hess ( aharonian et al .",
    "2007 ) , with a tev flux `` night - average '' intensity of a factor of @xmath4 larger than those of previous campaigns , was accompanied by an increase of the x - ray flux of only a factor of five without a significant change of the x - ray spectrum ( foschini et al .",
    "2007 ) . in the one - zone ssc scenario",
    "this can be accomplished with an increase of the doppler factor and the associated relativistic electrons together with a decrease of the magnetic field .",
    "therefore , it is important to obtain simultaneous observations over the largest possible uv and x - ray range together with simultaneous vhe observation to probe the correlation between the synchrotron and vhe emission .    to this end",
    "we organised a multiwavelength campaign to observe the blazar 1es1959 + 650 in the optical , uv , soft and hard x - ray up to the vhe gamma - ray ( @xmath0 gev ) bands .",
    "this is a bright and flaring x - ray and vhe source that has already been observed many times in these bands .",
    "it was discovered in the radio band as part of a 4.85 ghz survey performed with the 91 m nrao green bank telescope ( gregory & condon 1991 ; becker , white & edwards 1991 ) . in the optical band",
    "it is highly variable and shows a complex structure composed by an elliptical galaxy ( m@xmath5 , @xmath6=0.048 ) plus a disc and an absorption dust lane ( heidt et al .",
    "the mass of the central black hole has been estimated to be in the range @xmath7 as derived either from the stellar velocity dispersion or from the bulge luminosity ( falomo et al .",
    "the first x - ray measurement was performed by _",
    "einstein_-ipc during the slew survey ( elvis et al .",
    "subsequently , the source was observed by , _",
    "beppo_sax , _ rxte , argos , xmm - newton_. in particular two _ beppo_sax pointings , simultaneous with optical observations , were triggered in may - june 2002 because the source was in a high x - ray state .",
    "these data showed that the synchrotron peak was in the range 0.1 - 0.7 kev and that the overall optical and x - ray spectrum up to 45 kev was due to synchrotron emission with the peak moving to higher energy with the higher flux ( tagliaferri et al .",
    "the overall sed , with non simultaneous vhe data could be modelled with a homogeneous , one - zone synchrotron inverse compton model .",
    "the results of a multiwavelength campaign performed in may - june 2003 are presented in gutierrez et al .",
    "this campaign was triggered by the active state of the source in the x - ray band and it was found that the x - ray flux and x - ray photon index are correlated .",
    "a similar result was found by giebels et al .",
    "( 2002 ) using_rxte _ and _ argos _ data .",
    "this correlation shows that the x - ray spectrum in the 1 - 16 kev band is harder when the source is brighter . in the vhe band",
    "the source was detected by the hegra , whipple and magic telescopes ( aharonian et al .",

    "the reduction of the xis data followed the prescriptions reported in `` the suzaku data reduction guide '' . using the heasoft tool xselect we select good time intervals , excluding epochs of high background ( when the satellite crosses the south atlantic anomaly or the object is too close to the rim of the earth ) .",
    "after screening the net exposure time is 99.3 ksec . during the observation",
    "the source show a flare of small amplitude with rather small spectral variability ( see below ) : therefore we extracted the spectra corresponding to the whole observation .",
    "events are then extracted in a circle centred on the source with a radius of 6. background events are extracted in a similar circle centred in a region devoid of sources .",
    "we checked that the use of different source and background regions do not significantly affect the resulting spectra .",
    "response ( rmf ) and auxiliary ( arf ) files are produced using the tools developed by the team ( xisrmfgen and xissimarfgen ) distributed with the last version of heasoft .",
    "arfs are already corrected for the degradation of the xis response using the tool xiscontamicalc .    for the spectral analysis we use the xis data in the range 0.7 - 10",
    "below 0.7 kev there are still unsolved calibration problems . due to the high signal to noise of the data",
    "the residuals of the fits also reveal the presence of a deep edge around 1.8 kev , whose origin is clearly instrumental .",

    "an important issue in the analysis of the hxd / pin data concerns the estimate of the cosmic x - ray background , whose spectrum peaks just in this band .",

    "the observed x  ray variability behaviour allows a few interesting considerations about the properties of the emitting regions .",

    "2001 , guetta et al .",
    "2004 ) can not explain the variability we are observing .",
    "in fact , in this model the radiation is produced in a shock resulting from the collision of two shells moving at slightly different velocities . in this case",
    "the variability is predicted to be erratic , therefore to explain the variability we are seen we have to finely tune the different @xmath38 of the shells .",
    "we are thus led to consider the possibility that the observed radiation originates in the same region of the jet , through some kind of  standing shock \" .",
    "for instance , we might think to the interaction of a fast spine and a shear layer occurring at about the same distance from the central powerhouse ( see ghisellini , tavecchio & chiaberge 2005 for mode details , including the possibility of radiative deceleration of the spine through the  compton rocket \" effect in tev blazars ) .",
    "standing shock \" scenario has already been proposed by krawczynski et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in order to explain the tight correlation between x - ray and tev flares observed in mrk501 and it is discussed in some detail also by sokolov et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . as we did with the previous multiwavelength observing campaigns on 1es1959 + 650 that we organised based on the",
    "_ beppo_sax observations ( tagliaferri et al . 2003 ) , we can try to fit our sed with a homogeneous , one - zone synchrotron inverse compton model . during the _",
    "beppo_sax campaigns , in order to derive the ssc physical parameters we had to assume a value for the compton component , that we derived by rescaling a non - simultaneous vhe spectrum based on the x - ray flux .",
    "this time we have also the vhe observations , therefore both ssc components are constrained by real data . as shown by fig .",
    "[ sed ] , the x - ray spectrum as observed by and is about a factor of 2 higher than the one measured with and also the synchrotron peak has moved to somewhat higher energy , confirming the previous results of a higher energy peak with higher fluxes ( e.g. tagliaferri et al .",
    "2003 ) , that is typical for hbls ( see the dramatic case of mkn501 , pian et al .",
    "the optical fluxes are similar to the one reported for the 2002 sed .",
    "the observed vhe spectrum is similar , but lower , to that one of the 2002 sed . in summary",
    "the 2006 sed has optical fluxes that are similar to that ones of the 2002 , the x - ray fluxes are a factor of 2 higher and the vhe fluxes are a factor of @xmath1 lower . in the assumed one - zone ssc model ,",
    "the source is a sphere with radius @xmath39 moving with bulk lorentz factor @xmath38 and seen at an angle @xmath25 by the observer , resulting in a doppler factor @xmath40 .",
    "the magnetic field is tangled and uniform while the injected relativistic particle are assumed to have a ( smooth ) broken power law spectrum with normalisation @xmath41 , extending from @xmath42 to @xmath43 and with indexes @xmath44 and @xmath45 below and above the break at @xmath46 . assuming this model , the sed of may , 2006 can be well represented using the following parameters : @xmath47 , r@xmath48 cm , b=0.25 g , k=@xmath49 @xmath50 and an electron distribution extending from @xmath51 to @xmath52 , with a break at @xmath53 and slopes @xmath54 and @xmath55 . the intrinsic luminosity is @xmath56 erg s@xmath19 .",
    "if we compare these values with the one we derived for the 2002 sed ( though in that case we use a slightly different emission model ) , we saw that the parameters are very similar , with a source that is slightly more compact , a lower magnetic field and an almost identical doppler factor .",
    "similar values are also found to explain the sed of pks2155 - 304 during and after the strong tev flare observed in july , 2006 ; although in that case we found less steep slopes for the electrons and an higher value of @xmath40 ( see foschini et al .",
    "2007 ) . once again , the physical parameters that we derived assuming a one - zone ssc model are typical of hbl objects .",
    "finally , the historical seds of 1es1959 + 650 shows that in this source the synchrotron emission is dominating above the compton one .",
