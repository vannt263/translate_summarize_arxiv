    "the large number of top quark pairs expected to be produced at the ilc , e.g. , @xmath4 @xmath5 at @xmath6 ( based on a luminosity of @xmath7  @xcite ) , will enable one to precisely determine the top quark polarization from an angular analysis of its decay products in the dominant decay @xmath8 .",

    "@xcite that the polarization of the top quark in polarized @xmath1 annihilations can become quite large when the beam polarization is adequately tuned .",

    "many of the qualitative features of our results can be understood from extrapolations away from the two respective limits .",
    "we shall also address the question of how to maximize and minimize the polarization of the top quark by tuning the beam polarization . whereas a maximum polarization is optimal for the experimental determination of polarization effects , it is often desirable to gauge the quality of a polarization measurement against the corresponding unpolarized decay analysis .",
    "for some measurements it may even be advantageous to eliminate polarization effects altogether .    of course",
