    "it is worth noting that the former expression is obtained only under the complete description of ideal gases , i.e. , considering the finiteness of the heat bath . indeed , studying them only in the dig limit we miss the information of @xmath80 so that any effort to obtain extensivity in the logarithm has been performed by means of @xmath19-dependent terms .",

    "then , the difference in the expressions of the statistical @xmath28 and the thermodynamical @xmath35 density of states , preserving the bg - structure @xmath107 , may be attributed to the non - equality @xmath108 eq .",
    "gives the following information .",
    "if ones assumes that @xmath109 is a meaningful passage from the discrete @xmath110 to the continuous partition function , then the correspondence between phase space coordinates integration and energy integration must be revisited and properly modified , so that from @xmath111 one should be able to obtain eq . .",

    "however , in both cases any change in the above integrals of the partition function @xmath83 would cause a drastic and nontrivial change in the correspondence between sums and integrals throughout the statistical and physical theories . therefore , in author s opinion , the most natural explanation of the result @xmath114 is to preserve the equivalence between @xmath109 and @xmath111 and accept that the bg structure proposal for a statistical representation of the clausius entropy is not suitable . in this case , @xmath28 in eq .",

    "summarizing , we have derived the basic thermodynamic relations for ideal gases embedded in a finite heat bath ( container ) .",
    "we showed that the respective internal kinetic energy presents a linear dependence on the temperature and a power law dependence on the volume of the container .",
    "the latter dependence vanishes in the dilute gas limit ( infinite heat bath ) , recovering the structure of the known textbook expressions of the dilute ideal gases .",
    "we have then determined within phenomenological thermodynamics , preserving the structure of the boltzmann - gibbs entropic formula , the physical correspondence @xmath35 to the phase space density of states for our class of gases and computed the respective partition function @xmath117 of the canonical ensemble by means of the laplace transformation of @xmath35 .",
    "we observed that the former derived expressions are distinct from the analogous ones obtained within phase space statistics .",
    "the aforementioned discrepancy is attributed either to the non - equivalence between the energy integral and the corresponding integration over the phase space coordinates in the partition function or to the invalidity of the boltzmann - gibbs representation of the clausius entropy , i.e. , @xmath118 .",
