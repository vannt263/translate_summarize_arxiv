    "the existence of both confinement and asymptotic freedom in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has led to many speculations about its thermodynamic and transport properties . due to confinement , the nuclear matter must be made of hadrons at low energies , hence it is expected to behave as a weakly interacting gas of hadrons . on the other hand , at very high energies asymptotic freedom implies that quarks and gluons interact only weakly and the nuclear matter is expected to behave as a weakly coupled gas of quarks and gluons . in between these two configurations there must be a phase transition where the hadronic degrees of freedom disappear and a new state of matter , in which the quark and gluon degrees of freedom manifest directly over a certain volume , is formed .",
    "this new phase of matter , referred to as quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , is expected to be created when sufficiently high temperatures or densities are reached .",
    "the qgp is believed to have existed in the very early universe ( a few microseconds after the big bang ) , or some variant of which possibly still exists in the inner core of a neutron star where it is estimated that the density can reach values ten times higher than those of ordinary nuclei .",
    "it was conjectured theoretically that such extreme conditions can also be realized on earth , in a controlled experimental environment , by colliding two heavy nuclei with ultra - relativistic energies @xcite .",
    "this may transform a fraction of the kinetic energies of the two colliding nuclei into heating the qcd vacuum within an extremely small volume where temperatures million times hotter than the core of the sun may be achieved .    with the advent of modern accelerator facilities ,",
    "ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions have provided an opportunity to systematically create and study different phases of the bulk nuclear matter .",
    "it is widely believed that the qgp phase is formed in heavy - ion collision experiments at relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) located at brookhaven national laboratory , usa and large hadron collider ( lhc ) at european organization for nuclear research ( cern ) , geneva .",
    "a number of indirect evidences found at the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) at cern , strongly suggested the formation of a _  new state of matter \" _",
    "@xcite , but quantitative and clear results were only obtained at rhic energies @xcite , and recently at lhc energies @xcite .",
    "the regime with relatively large baryon chemical potential will be probed by the upcoming experimental facilities like facility for anti - proton and ion research ( fair ) at gsi , darmstadt .",
    "an illustration of the qcd phase diagram and the regions probed by these experimental facilities is shown in fig .",

    "it is possible to create hot and dense nuclear matter with very high energy densities in relatively large volumes by colliding ultra - relativistic heavy ions . in these conditions , the nuclear matter created",
    "may be close to ( local ) thermodynamic equilibrium , providing the opportunity to investigate the various phases and the thermodynamic and transport properties of qcd .",
    "it is important to note that , even though it appears that a deconfined state of matter is formed in these colliders , investigating and extracting the transport properties of qgp from heavy - ion collisions is not an easy task since it can not be observed directly .",
    "experimentally , it is only feasible to measure energy and momenta of the particles produced in the final stages of the collision , when nuclear matter is already relatively cold and non - interacting . hence , in order to study the thermodynamic and transport properties of the qgp , the whole heavy - ion collision process from the very beginning till the end has to be modelled : starting from the stage where two highly lorentz contracted heavy nuclei collide with each other , the formation and thermalization of the qgp or de - confined phase in the initial stages of the collision , its subsequent space - time evolution , the phase transition to the hadronic or confined phase of matter , and eventually , the dynamics of the cold hadronic matter formed in the final stages of the collision .",
    "the different stages of ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions are schematically illustrated in fig .",

    ", the time evolution of the qgp and hadronic matter can be described by the laws of fluid dynamics .",
    "fluid dynamics , also loosely referred to as hydrodynamics , is an effective approach through which a system can be described by macroscopic variables , such as local energy density , pressure , temperature and flow velocity .",
    "the most appealing feature of fluid dynamics is the fact that it is simple and general .",
    "it is simple in the sense that all the information of the system is contained in its thermodynamic and transport properties , i.e. , its equation of state and transport coefficients .",
    "fluid dynamics is also general because it relies on only one assumption : the system remains close to local thermodynamic equilibrium throughout its evolution .",
    "although the hypothesis of proximity to local equilibrium is quite strong , it saves us from making any further assumption regarding the description of the particles and fields , their interactions , the classical or quantum nature of the phenomena involved etc .",
    "hydrodynamic analysis of the spectra and azimuthal anisotropy of particles produced in heavy - ion collisions at rhic and recently at lhc suggests that the matter formed in these collisions is strongly - coupled quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) .",
    "application of viscous hydrodynamics to high - energy heavy - ion collisions has evoked widespread interest ever since a surprisingly small value of @xmath0 was estimated from the analysis of the elliptic flow data @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the strong coupling limit of a large class of holographic theories , the value of the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath1 .",
    "kovtun , son and starinets ( kss ) conjectured this strong coupling result to be the absolute lower bound for all fluids , i.e. , @xmath2 .",
    "this specific combination of hydrodynamic quantities , @xmath0 , accounts for the difference between momentum and charge diffusion such that even though the diffusion constant goes to zero in the strong coupling limit , the ratio @xmath0 remains finite @xcite .",
    "similar result for a lower bound also follows from the quantum mechanical uncertainty principle .",
    "the kinetic theory prediction for viscosity , @xmath3 , suggests that low viscosity corresponds to short mean free path . on the other hand",
    ", the uncertainty relation implies that the product of the mean free path and the average momentum can not be arbitrarily small , i.e. , @xmath4 . for a weakly interacting relativistic bose gas ,",
    "the entropy per particle is given by @xmath5 .",
    "this leads to @xmath6 which is very close to the lower kss bound .",
    "indeed the estimated @xmath0 of qgp was so close to the kss bound that it led to the claim that the matter formed at rhic was the most perfect fluid ever observed .",
    "a precise estimate of @xmath0 is vital to the understanding of the properties of the qcd matter and is presently a topic of intense investigation , see and references therein for more details . in this review",
    ", we shall discuss the general aspects of the formulation of relativistic fluid dynamics and its application to the physics of high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "along with these general concepts we shall also discuss here some of the recent developments in the field . among the recent developments the most striking feature is the experimental observation of flow like pattern in the particle azimuthal distribution of high multiplicity proton - proton ( p - p ) and proton - lead ( p - pb)collisions .",
    "we will discuss in this review the success of hydrodynamics model in describing these recent experimental measurements by assuming hydrodynamics flow of small systems .",
    "the review is organised as follows , in section ii we discuss the general formalism of a causal theory of relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics .",
    "section iii deals with the initial conditions necessary for the modeling of relativistic heavy - ion , p - p and p - pb collisions . in section iv , we discuss some models of pre - equilibrium dynamics employed before hydrodynamic evolution . section v briefly covers various equations of state , necessary to close the hydrodynamic equations . in section",
    "vi , particle production mechanism via cooper - frye freeze - out and anisotropic flow generation is discussed . in section vii",
    ", we discuss models of hadronic rescattering after freeze - out and contribution to particle spectra and flow from resonance decays . section viii deals with the extraction of transport coefficients from hydrodynamic analysis of flow data .",

    "apart from minkowskian coordinates @xmath13 , we will also regularly employ milne coordinate system @xmath14 or @xmath15 , with proper time @xmath16 , the radial coordinate @xmath17 , the azimuthal angle @xmath18 , and spacetime rapidity @xmath19 .",

    "we follow einstein summation convention , which states that repeated indices in a single term are implicitly summed over all the values of that index .",

    "the physical characterization of a system consisting of many degrees of freedom is in general a non - trivial task .",
    "for instance , the mathematical formulation of a theory describing the microscopic dynamics of a system containing a large number of interacting particles is one of the most challenging problems of theoretical physics .",
    "however , it is possible to provide an effective macroscopic description , over large distance and time scales , by taking into account only the degrees of freedom that are relevant at these scales .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that on macroscopic distance and time scales the actual degrees of freedom of the microscopic theory are imperceptible .",
    "most of the microscopic variables fluctuate rapidly in space and time , hence only average quantities resulting from the interactions at the microscopic level can be observed on macroscopic scales .",
    "these rapid fluctuations lead to very small changes of the average values , and hence are not expected to contribute to the macroscopic dynamics . on the other hand , variables that do vary slowly , such as the conserved quantities , are expected to play an important role in the effective description of the system .",
    "fluid dynamics is one of the most common examples of such a situation .",
    "it is an effective theory describing the long - wavelength , low frequency limit of the underlying microscopic dynamics of a system .",
    "a fluid is defined as a continuous system in which every infinitesimal volume element is assumed to be close to thermodynamic equilibrium and to remain near equilibrium throughout its evolution .",
    "hence , in other words , in the neighbourhood of each point in space , an infinitesimal volume called fluid element is defined in which the matter is assumed to be homogeneous , i.e. , any spatial gradients can be ignored , and is described by a finite number of thermodynamic variables .",
    "this implies that each fluid element must be large enough , compared to the microscopic distance scales , to guarantee the proximity to thermodynamic equilibrium , and , at the same time , must be small enough , relative to the macroscopic distance scales , to ensure the continuum limit .",
    "the co - existence of both continuous ( zero volume ) and thermodynamic ( infinite volume ) limits within a fluid volume might seem paradoxical at first glance .",
    "however , if the microscopic and the macroscopic length scales of the system are sufficiently far apart , it is always possible to establish the existence of a volume that is small enough compared to the macroscopic scales , and at the same time , large enough compared to the microscopic ones . here , we will assume the existence of a clear separation between microscopic and macroscopic scales to guarantee the proximity to local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "relativistic fluid dynamics has been quite successful in explaining the various collective phenomena observed in astrophysics , cosmology and the physics of high - energy heavy - ion collisions . in cosmology and certain areas of astrophysics",
    ", one needs a fluid dynamics formulation consistent with the general theory of relativity . on the other hand ,",
    "a formulation based on the special theory of relativity is quite adequate to treat the evolution of the strongly interacting matter formed in high - energy heavy - ion collisions when it is close to a local thermodynamic equilibrium . in fluid dynamical approach , although no detailed knowledge of the microscopic dynamics is needed , however , knowledge of the equation of state relating pressure , energy density and baryon density is required .",
    "the collective behaviour of the hot and dense quark - gluon plasma created in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions has been studied quite extensively within the framework of relativistic fluid dynamics . in application of fluid dynamics , it is natural to first employ the simplest version which is ideal hydrodynamics which neglects the viscous effects and assumes that local equilibrium is always perfectly maintained during the fireball expansion .",
    "microscopically , this requires that the microscopic scattering time be much shorter than the macroscopic expansion ( evolution ) time . in other words , ideal hydrodynamics",
    "assumes that the mean free path of the constituent particles is much smaller than the system size .",
    "however , as all fluids are dissipative in nature due to the quantum mechanical uncertainty principle @xcite , the ideal fluid results serve only as a benchmark when dissipative effects become important .    when discussing the application of relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics to heavy - ion collision ,",
    "one is faced with yet another predicament : the theory of relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics is not yet conclusively established .",
    "in fact , introducing dissipation in relativistic fluids is not at all a trivial task and still remains one of the important topics of research in high - energy physics .",
    "ideal hydrodynamics assumes that local thermodynamic equilibrium is perfectly maintained and each fluid element is homogeneous , i.e. , spatial gradients are absent ( zeroth order in gradient expansion ) .",
    "if this is not satisfied , dissipative effects come into play .",
    "the earliest theoretical formulations of relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics also known as first - order theories , are due to eckart @xcite and landau - lifshitz @xcite .",
    "however , these formulations , collectively called relativistic navier - stokes ( ns ) theory , suffer from acausality and numerical instability .",
    "the reason for the acausality is that in the gradient expansion the dissipative currents are linearly proportional to gradients of temperature , chemical potential , and velocity , resulting in parabolic equations .",
    "thus , in navier - stokes theory the gradients have an instantaneous influence on the dissipative currents .",
    "such instantaneous effects tend to violate causality and can not be allowed in a covariant setup , leading to the instabilities investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the second - order israel - stewart ( is ) theory @xcite , restores causality but may not guarantee stability .",
    "the acausality problems were solved by introducing a time delay in the creation of the dissipative currents from gradients of the fluid - dynamical variables . in this case , the dissipative quantities become independent dynamical variables obeying equations of motion that describe their relaxation towards their respective navier - stokes values .",
    "the resulting equations are hyperbolic in nature which preserves causality .",
    "israel - stewart theory has been widely applied to ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions in order to describe the time evolution of the qgp and the subsequent freeze - out process of the hadron resonance gas .",
    "although is hydrodynamics has been quite successful in modelling relativistic heavy - ion collisions , there are several inconsistencies and approximations in its formulation which prevent proper understanding of the thermodynamic and transport properties of the qgp . moreover , the second - order is theory can be derived in several ways , each leading to a different set of transport coefficients .",
    "therefore , in order to quantify the transport properties of the qgp from experiment and confirm the claim that it is indeed the most perfect fluid ever created , the theoretical foundations of relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics must be first addressed and clearly understood . in this section ,",
    "we review the basic aspects of thermodynamics and discuss the formulation of relativistic fluid dynamics from a phenomenological perspective .",
    "the salient features of kinetic theory in the context of fluid dynamics will also be discussed .",
    "thermodynamics is an empirical description of the macroscopic or large - scale properties of matter and it makes no hypotheses about the small - scale or microscopic structure .",
    "it is concerned only with the average behaviour of a very large number of microscopic constituents , and its laws can be derived from statistical mechanics .",
    "a thermodynamic system can be described in terms of a small set of extensive variables , such as volume ( @xmath43 ) , the total energy ( @xmath44 ) , entropy ( @xmath45 ) , and number of particles ( @xmath46 ) , of the system .",
    "thermodynamics is based on four phenomenological laws that explain how these quantities are related and how they change with time @xcite .    * * zeroth law * : if two systems are both in thermal equilibrium with a third system then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other .",
    "this law helps define the notion of temperature . * * first law * : all the energy transfers must be accounted for to ensure the conservation of the total energy of a thermodynamic system and its surroundings .",
    "this law is the principle of conservation of energy . * * second law * : an isolated physical system spontaneously evolves towards its own internal state of thermodynamic equilibrium . employing the notion of entropy ,",
    "this law states that the change in entropy of a closed thermodynamic system is always positive or zero . * * third law * : also known an nernst s heat theorem , states that the difference in entropy between systems connected by a reversible process is zero in the limit of vanishing temperature .",
    "in other words , it is impossible to reduce the temperature of a system to absolute zero in a finite number of operations .",
    "the first law of thermodynamics postulates that the changes in the total energy of a thermodynamic system must result from : * ( 1 ) * heat exchange , * ( 2 ) * the mechanical work done by an external force , and * ( 3 ) * from particle exchange with an external medium .",
    "hence the conservation law relating the small changes in state variables , @xmath44 , @xmath43 , and @xmath46 is @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the pressure and chemical potential , respectively , and @xmath50 is the amount of heat exchange .",
    "the heat exchange takes into account the energy variations due to changes of internal degrees of freedom that are not described by the state variables .",
    "the heat itself is not a state variable since it can depend on the past evolution of the system and may take several values for the same thermodynamic state .",
    "however , when dealing with reversible processes ( in time ) , it becomes possible to assign a state variable related to heat .",
    "this variable is the entropy , @xmath45 , and is defined in terms of the heat exchange as @xmath51 , with the temperature @xmath52 being the proportionality constant .",
    "then , when considering variations between equilibrium states that are infinitesimally close to each other , it is possible to write the first law of thermodynamics in terms of differentials of the state variables , @xmath53 hence , using eq .",
    "( [ flt ] ) , the intensive quantities , @xmath52 , @xmath49 and @xmath48 , can be obtained in terms of partial derivatives of the entropy as @xmath54    the entropy is mathematically defined as an extensive and additive function of the state variables , which means that @xmath55 differentiating both sides with respect to @xmath56 , we obtain @xmath57 which holds for any arbitrary value of @xmath56 . setting @xmath58 and using eq .",
    "( [ dsdedndv ] ) , we obtain the so - called euler s relation @xmath59 using euler s relation , eq .",
    "( [ tder ] ) , along with the first law of thermodynamics , eq .",
    "( [ flt ] ) , we arrive at the gibbs - duhem relation @xmath60    in terms of energy , entropy and number densities defined as @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 respectively , the euler s relation , eq .",

    "( [ gdr ] ) , reduce to @xmath64 differentiating eq .",
    "( [ erd ] ) and using eq .",
    "( [ gdrd ] ) , we obtain the relation analogous to first law of thermodynamics @xmath65 it is important to note that all the densities defined above @xmath66 are intensive quantities .",
    "the equilibrium state of a system is defined as a stationary state where the extensive and intensive variables of the system do not change .",
    "we know from the second law of thermodynamics that the entropy of an isolated thermodynamic system must either increase or remain constant .",
    "hence , if a thermodynamic system is in equilibrium , the entropy of the system being an extensive variable , must remain constant . on the other hand , for a system that is out of equilibrium , the entropy must always increase .",
    "this is an extremely powerful concept that will be extensively used in this section to constrain and derive the equations of motion of a dissipative fluid .",
    "this concludes a brief outline of the basics of thermodynamics ; for a more detailed review , see ref .",
    "@xcite . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce and derive the equations of relativistic ideal fluid dynamics .",
    "an ideal fluid is defined by the assumption of local thermal equilibrium , i.e. , all fluid elements must be exactly in thermodynamic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "this means that at each space - time coordinate of the fluid @xmath67 , there can be assigned a temperature @xmath68 , a chemical potential @xmath69 , and a collective four - velocity field , @xmath70 the proper time increment @xmath71 is given by the line element @xmath72,\\ ] ] where @xmath73 .",

    "the state of a fluid can be completely specified by the densities and currents associated with conserved quantities , i.e. , energy , momentum , and ( net ) particle number .",
    "for a relativistic fluid , the state variables are the energy- momentum tensor , @xmath79 , and the ( net ) particle four - current , @xmath80 . to obtain the general form of these currents for an ideal fluid",

    "in other words , in local rest frame , there is no flow of energy ( @xmath85 ) , the force per unit surface element is isotropic ( @xmath86 ) and there is no particle and entropy flow ( @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) .",
    "consequently , the energy - momentum tensor , particle and entropy four - currents in this frame take the following simple forms @xmath89    for an ideal relativistic fluid , the general form of the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath90 , ( net ) particle four - current , @xmath91 , and the entropy four - current , @xmath92 , has to be built out of the hydrodynamic tensor degrees of freedom , namely the vector , @xmath29 , and the metric tensor , @xmath93 .",

    "the earliest covariant formulation of dissipative fluid dynamics were due to eckart @xcite , in 1940 , and , later , by landau and lifshitz @xcite , in 1959 .",
    "the formulation of these theories , collectively known as first - order theories ( order of gradients ) , was based on a covariant generalization of the navier - stokes theory .",
    "the navier - stokes theory , at that time , had already become a successful theory of dissipative fluid dynamics .",
    "it was employed efficiently to describe a wide variety of non - relativistic fluids , from weakly coupled gases such as air , to strongly coupled fluids such as water .",
    "hence , a relativistic generalisation of navier - stokes theory was considered to be the most effective and promising way to describe relativistic dissipative fluids .",
    "the formulation of relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics turned out to be more subtle since the relativistic generalisation of navier - stokes theory is intrinsically unstable @xcite .",
    "the source of such instability is attributed to the inherent acausal behaviour of this theory @xcite .",
    "a straightforward relativistic generalisation of navier - stokes theory allows signals to propagate with infinite speed in a medium . while in non - relativistic theories",
    ", this does not give rise to an intrinsic problem and can be ignored , in relativistic systems where causality is a physical property that is naturally preserved , this feature leads to intrinsically unstable equations of motion . nevertheless , it is instructive to review the first - order theories as they are an important initial step to illustrate the basic features of relativistic dissipative fluid - dynamics .    as in the case of ideal fluids ,",
    "the basic equations governing the motion of dissipative fluids are also obtained from the conservation laws of energy - momentum and ( net ) particle number , @xmath121 however , for dissipative fluids , the energy - momentum tensor is no longer diagonal and isotropic in the local rest frame . moreover , due to diffusion , the particle flow is expected to appear in the local rest frame of the fluid element . to account for these effects ,",
    "dissipative currents @xmath122 and @xmath123 are added to the previously derived ideal currents , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , @xmath124 where , @xmath122 is required to be symmetric ( @xmath125 ) in order to satisfy angular momentum conservation .",
    "the main objective then becomes to find the dynamical or constitutive equations satisfied by these dissipative currents .",
    "the introduction of the dissipative currents causes the equilibrium variables to be ill - defined , since the fluid can no longer be considered to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "hence , in a dissipative fluid , the thermodynamic variables can only be defined in terms of an artificial equilibrium state , constructed such that the thermodynamic relations are valid as if the fluid were in local thermodynamic equilibrium . the first step to construct such",
    "an equilibrium state is to define @xmath107 and @xmath108 as the total energy and particle density in the local rest frame of the fluid , respectively .",
    "this is guaranteed by imposing the so - called matching or fitting conditions @xcite , @xmath126 these matching conditions enforces the following constraints on the dissipative currents @xmath127 subsequently , using @xmath108 and @xmath107 , an artificial equilibrium state can be constructed with the help of the equation of state .",
    "it is however important to note that while the energy and particle densities are physically defined , all the other thermodynamic quantities ( @xmath128 ) are defined only in terms of an artificial equilibrium state and do not necessarily retain their usual physical meaning .      to proceed further ,",
    "it is convenient to decompose @xmath122 in terms of its irreducible components , i.e. , a scalar , a four - vector , and a traceless and symmetric second - rank tensor .",

    "the properties of the projection operators @xmath138 and @xmath132 imply that both @xmath136 and @xmath137 are orthogonal to @xmath29 and , additionally , @xmath137 is traceless .",

    "we observe that @xmath79 is a symmetric second - rank tensor with ten independent components and @xmath80 is a four - vector ; overall they have fourteen independent components .",
    "next we count the number of independent components in the tensor decompositions of @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",

    "the reason being that so far , the velocity field @xmath29 was introduced as a general normalized four - vector and was not specified . hence @xmath29 has to be defined to reduce the number of independent components to the correct value .      in the process of formulating the theory of dissipative fluid dynamics ,",
    "the next important step is to fix @xmath29 . in the case of ideal fluids ,",
    "the local rest frame was defined as the frame in which there is , simultaneously , no net energy and particle flow .",
    "while the definition of local rest frame was unambiguous for ideal fluids , this definition is no longer possible in the case of dissipative fluids due to the presence of both energy and particle diffusion . from a mathematical perspective",

    "in this review article , we have discussed various aspects of relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics and its application to high energy heavy - ion collisions . while considerable success has been achieved in explaining many experimental observations , there are several issues that still needs further investigation .",
    "for example the experimentally measured longitudinal correlation of flow harmonics shows a splitting in the quantities corresponds to the correlation measure namely @xmath468 and @xmath469 for two different reference rapidity windows , which can not be explained within a ( 3 + 1)d ideal hydrodynamics model with initial condition obtained from hijing model .",
    "the reason behind this experimentally observed difference in @xmath468 and @xmath469 is still poorly understood .",
    "it was also argued in the present review that the effect of magnetic field might not be negligible on the hydrodynamics evolution of qgp produced in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "particularly it may be important for the reason that the elliptic and higher - order flow harmonics might be affected under such strong magnetic field .",
    "however , at present there are some open issues in this regard : the electrical conductivity of the qgp might play an essential role in the temporal decay of the magnetic field .",
    "a poor knowledge of the temperature dependent electrical conductivity is one of the major source of uncertainties .",
    "in addition to that , the magnetic susceptibility of the qgp and the hadron resonance gas should be included for a realistic calculation .",
    "another unsolved problem is the experimentally measured @xmath400 , @xmath420 in ultra - central collisions . within error",
    "bars the magnitude of @xmath400 and @xmath420 are observed to be same for ultra - central collisions ( 0 - 0.2% ) .",
    "although viscous hydrodynamics model with mc - kln initial condition considering nucleon - nucleon correlations produces quite close result to the experimental measurement , it is still not fully explained within the given error .",
    "another puzzling aspect of high energy collisions is the observation of flow like behaviour in small systems .",
    "initial study shows that the experimentally observed flow harmonics and other bulk observables for high multiplicity p - p and p - pb collisions can be well described within viscous hydrodynamics model simulation .",
    "a detailed theoretical explanation of how such small system behave collectively is still not well understood .",
    "there are also possibility for non - hydrodynamical origin of this observed flow in such small system .",
    "this is a topic of current research and we hope we will have more clear theoretical understanding within next few years when further studies including alternative possibilities will be available .    finally we note that the field of high energy collisions is a very active area of research , we have not covered all aspects of the recent developments in the field related to hydrodynamics / collectivity of the qgp . for example the event - by - event distribution of flow harmonics @xcite and their correlations @xcite emerges as a promising observable to better constrain the initial conditions and the shear viscosity of the qgp .",
    "the event - by - event study of photon and dilepton production within viscous hydrodynamics provide us another window to look at the early stages of the heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "we hope that through all these ongoing experimental and theoretical / phenomenological studies we will have much refined understanding about the collective behaviour and the transport properties of the qgp in the near future .",
