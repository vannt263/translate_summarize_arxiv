    "the dmr ( differential microwave radiometers ) instrument aboard the _ cobe _ satellite ( boggess  1992 and references therein , smoot  1990 ) was designed to measure anisotropy in the cmb temperature on @xmath9 angular scales .",
    "the detection of anisotropy ( smoot  1992 , bennett  1996 and references therein ) provides important information on conditions in the early universe .",
    "it is widely interpreted that the signal seen by dmr is of cosmological , and possibly primordial , origin . as such",
    ", it provides key information on gravitational potential fluctuations in the early universe that presumably served as the seeds for the formation of large scale structure . the primary evidence that the anisotropy is cosmological arises from a spectral analysis of the 3 dmr frequency channels at 31.5 , 53 , and 90 ghz .",
    "cosmological anisotropy is predicted to have a planckian spectrum of the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 k is the mean temperature of the cmb ( fixsen  1996 ) , @xmath12 is the planck function at temperature @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the temperature anisotropy in a given direction in the sky .",
    "the dmr anisotropy data are consistent with a planck spectrum and are inconsistent with any known galactic emission ( hinshaw  1996 , banday  1997 ) .",
    "however , the frequency range covered by dmr is relatively limited , and observations of the anisotropy into the wien region of the spectrum would greatly strengthen the view that the anisotropy is due to temperature fluctuations in the cmb .",
    "ganga  ( 1993 ) cross - correlated the firs balloon - based anisotropy map with the dmr data and found a significantly correlated signal at 170 ghz . to date , this has been the only direct test of the dmr at frequencies approaching the wien region of the spectrum .",
    "the firas ( far infrared absolute spectrophotometer ) instrument aboard the  satellite ( mather  1993 ) was designed to measure the spectrum of the cmb .",
    "the firas observations demonstrate that the spectrum of the uniform ( monopole ) component of the cmb is planckian to 50 ppm of the peak radiation intensity ( mather  1990 , mather  1994 , fixsen   1996 ) .",
    "moreover , the cmb dipole exhibits a planck spectrum ( @xmath15 ) to high precision ( fixsen  1994a , fixsen  1996 ) . in this paper",
    "we assess the spectrum and spatial distribution of the higher - order anisotropy in the firas data .",
    "the measurement of the anisotropy spectrum is difficult because the intrinsic anisotropy is weak , roughly one part in @xmath16 of the intrinsic cmb brightness , and near the limits of the firas sensitivity and stability , _ ie .",
    "_ it is difficult to make absolute measurements of the cmb that are stable to 0.001% over the course of a year of observations .",
    "in addition , as one approaches the wien region of the spectrum the signal becomes dominated by emission from interstellar dust . to overcome these difficulties our analysis employs data from all three cobe instruments : the firas data provide the spectrum , the dmr data provide the spatial distribution of the anisotropy , in effect telling us how to average the firas spectral data , while the longest wavelength channels from the diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) are used to characterize the dust that would otherwise confuse the measurement .",
    "we have analyzed the firas data in two complementary ways .",
    "first , the dmr and dirbe maps are used as spatial templates to which the firas data are fit .",
    "the result is a single mean spectrum per map of the emission traced by that map .",
    "the mean spectrum corresponding to the dmr anisotropy may be compared to the planck spectrum given above .",
    "second , the firas data are fit to three spectral functions to obtain three corresponding sky maps .",
    "one of the spectra is taken to be the planck function with the pixel temperature as a free parameter .",
    "the other two are designed to model the spectrum of the dust with intensity and temperature as the free parameters .",
    "the map of the ( planckian ) cmb temperature may then be compared to the dmr anisotropy map using a cross - correlation analysis .",
    "the low frequency firas data consist of spectra between 2 and 20 @xmath17 ( 0.5 cm to 500 @xmath18 m wavelength ) in each of 6068 pixels on the sky ( there are 6144 pixels in the full sky ) .",
    "they were calibrated using the method described in , with the improvements noted in fixsen  1996",
    ". a weighted average of all of the low frequency firas data was used .",
    "the dmr anisotropy map we use is a modification of the  correlation \" technique reduced - galaxy map described in kogut et al .",
    "it is a weighted average of all six dmr channel maps after correcting each for galactic emission as traced by the haslam 408 mhz radio map , the dirbe 140 @xmath18 m map , _ and _ the dirbe 240 @xmath18 m map .",
    "our modification entails fitting the two dirbe templates simultaneously which parallels our treatment of galactic emission in the firas data , described below .",
    "we have also subtracted a best - fit monopole and dipole from the map , for @xmath19 , prior to our analysis .",
    "the long wavelength dirbe data was corrected for low - level emission from interplanetary ( zodiacal ) dust by interpolating to the response at a solar elongation of @xmath20 corresponding to the firas pointing .",
    "all of the data sets were pixelized in ecliptic coordinates .",
    "both the firas and dmr data have @xmath9 angular resolution , as measured by their full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , but the detailed beam profiles are different .",
    "the dmr beam is approximately gaussian ( wright  1994 ) , while the firas beam more closely resembles a top hat profile .",
    "prior to fitting the higher resolution dirbe ( and haslam ) data to the firas and dmr data we have convolved each with the firas and dmr beam profiles , respectively .",
    "additionally , prior to comparing the firas and dmr anisotropy data to each other , we have convolved the firas data with a @xmath9 fwhm gaussian .",
    "we estimate that the resulting beam window functions agree to within 5% to multipole order @xmath21 .",
    "the firas sky spectra are a function of frequency and position : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are galactic coordinates and @xmath25 is frequency .",
    "since the data are binned into discrete pixels , @xmath26 , and frequencies , @xmath25 , we can also write the firas data as @xmath27 . prior to investigating cmb anisotropy",
    ", we model the dominant emission components in the data by assuming the frequency and spatial dependences are separable , as follows @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes our model of the data @xmath30 .",
    "the cmb monopole is represented by the uniform spectrum @xmath31 ; the cmb dipole anisotropy is represented by the spatial distribution @xmath32 and the spectrum @xmath33 .",
    "galactic emission is modeled using two spatial templates , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and two spectra @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in this analysis ,",
    "we fix the spatial templates above and perform a least - squares fit of the data to determine the spectra , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 at each frequency .",
    "the spatial templates @xmath32 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are specified as follows .",
    "the dipole is given by @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the angle between the direction of observation and the dipole direction , @xmath44 = @xmath45 ( bennett  1996 ) .",
    "for the two galactic templates we use the 240 @xmath18 m and 140 @xmath18 m dirbe maps convolved to the firas beam profile .",
    "the use of two templates simultaneously allows for modest spatial variations in the galactic dust spectrum and for a possible far infrared background . to give the derived spectra common units of mjy sr@xmath46 ,",
    "we normalize the spatial templates to be dimensionless .",
    "the dipole map is scaled to range from @xmath47 to @xmath48 .",
    "the galaxy maps are scaled such that the average value over the polar caps ( @xmath49 ) is 1.07 , corresponding to the mean of csc@xmath50 over the same region . the resulting galaxy spectrum",
    "roughly gives the intensity at the galactic poles .",
    "for the fit we define @xmath51 to be @xmath52~w_{pp'}~ [ s_{p'\\nu}-m_{p'\\nu}(u , d , g , h)]/\\sigma_\\nu^2\\ ] ] where @xmath53 are sky pixel indices , @xmath54 is the inverse of the pixel - pixel covariance of the firas data , including correlations introduced by the calibration and  de - striping \" processes , and @xmath55 is the factorable uncertainty of the spectrum at frequency @xmath25 , including  glitch \" effects ( see fixsen  1996 ) .",
    "this @xmath51 is minimized independently at each frequency to determine the mean spectra @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "it is important to note that this fit makes no a priori assumptions about the forms of these spectra ; only their spatial distributions are posited .",
    "note also that @xmath56 does not affect the best - fit intensity at each frequency , only our estimate of the uncertainty .",
    "the firas data have been processed in such a way as to maintain the separability of the positional and the spectral uncertainties .    for the discussion below we have excluded data with @xmath57 although other galactic cuts were examined .",
    "the derived spectra are shown in fig 1 .",
    "the monopole and dipole spectra have been discussed extensively in fixsen  ( 1996 ) ; this work does not alter any of their conclusions .",
    "the galactic spectra , fig .",
    "1c , are the shape one would expect for dust at @xmath58 k. the negative spectrum for the 140 @xmath18 m map is a natural consequence of a frequency extrapolation that does not account for a varying dust temperature . indeed ,",
    "if the dust temperature were constant , the ( normalized ) 240 @xmath18 m and 140 @xmath18 m maps would be identical and the fit would be degenerate . to study the galactic dust emission one should look at the higher frequencies and lower latitudes ; here we are only interested in removing the dust emission .",
    "the firas residual spectra , @xmath59 , now contain only cmb anisotropy , noise , and unmodeled signals and/or systematic effects .",
    "we convolve the residual spectra with a 7@xmath1 fwhm gaussian beam to approximate the beam response of the dmr map .",
    "this yields smoothed spectra , @xmath60 , with a covariance matrix @xmath61 .",
    "there are 4004 pixels ( @xmath62 square ) remaining in the data after applying the 20@xmath63 galaxy cut and excising the pixels not observed by firas .",
    "we normalize the dmr map to roughly unit @xmath0 by dividing it by 35 @xmath18k , the estimated @xmath0 of the anisotropy ( banday  1997 ) .",
    "this allows us to compare the derived anisotropy spectrum to the previously derived spectra using consistent units .",
    "we denote the normalized map @xmath64 . in accounting for the noise in both the firas and dmr data , the best - fit spectrum , @xmath65 ,",
    "is given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is any symmetric matrix ( see below ) , and @xmath68 is the covariance matrix of the dmr map which we take to be diagonal , @xmath69 ( here @xmath70 is the noise per pixel in the dmr map ) . the second term in the denominator is a bias correction that accounts for the fact that noise in the template @xmath64 biases the first term .",
    "any symmetric matrix @xmath67 will give an unbiased estimate of the anisotropy spectrum ; we use the inverse of an effective combined diagonal firas and dmr matrix .",
    "the full covariance matrix is given by @xmath71 .",
    "we define @xmath67 to be @xmath72 with @xmath73 for all frequencies .",
    "this keeps the calculation simple and is reasonable since @xmath74 dominates the covariance as the firas uncertainties are larger than the dmr uncertainties .    the anisotropy spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "1d . there is a significant detection of signal correlated with the dmr anisotropy : the @xmath51 for zero signal is 75 for 43 d.o.f . , while a @xmath75 spectrum normalized to the dmr results give a @xmath51 of 48 .",
    "_ this strongly suggests that the anisotropy observed by dmr , and corroborated by firas , is due to temperature variations in the cmb .",
    "_    we have also simultaneously fit all 5 maps ( 1 , @xmath32 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath64 ) and have applied galactic cuts between @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "none of these cases show significantly different results , although with a galactic cut of only @xmath78 there is evidence for galactic contamination in the anisotropy spectrum .",
    "we emphasize that best - fit galactic templates have been subtracted from both the dmr and firas maps , and that the same two galactic templates were used on each .",
    "the effects of the firas gain variations and other nonlinear effects are entirely negligible because of the small amplitude of the anisotropy .",
    "most instrumental systematic effects are suppressed in the analysis because of the differences in the dmr and firas instruments and scan patterns .",
    "figure 2 shows the anisotropy spectrum along with the _ predicted _ planck spectrum based on the dmr data alone .",
    "the data in this figure were binned coarsely in frequency for display , but our analysis of the spectrum was performed on the original data .",
    "the data at different frequencies are mildly ( @xmath79 ) correlated , which we account for in our spectral analysis .",
    "if we _ fit _ the firas spectrum to a planck spectrum , @xmath80 , we find correlated @xmath0 temperature fluctuations of @xmath81k compared to the dmr value of @xmath82k ( banday  1997 )",
    ". we can further analyze the spectrum @xmath83 to search for evidence of spectral distortions due to the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect , or for signs of residual galactic contamination .",
    "we fit @xmath83 to a model of the form @xmath84 , where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the dust emissivity and temperature respectively . since the dmr map was normalized to have unit @xmath0",
    ", @xmath87 corresponds to the @xmath0 level of planckian temperature anisotropy , @xmath88 corresponds to the @xmath0 level of sunyaev - zeldovich temperature anisotropy in the rayleigh - jeans limit , and @xmath89 corresponds to the @xmath0 level of dust emission relative to the emission at the galactic poles . fixing @xmath90 and @xmath91k , we find ( @xmath92 ) = ( @xmath93k , @xmath94k , @xmath95 ) . the value of @xmath87 is consistent with the measured dmr @xmath0 of @xmath96 @xmath18k .",
    "there is no evidence for sunyaev - zeldovich anisotropy , though the fit does indicate a small amount of galactic leakage .",
    "we can also combine the 3 dmr single - frequency @xmath0 fluctuation data at 31.5 , 53 and 90 ghz with the spectrum @xmath65 to form a single spectrum .",
    "these data are fit for @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 giving ( @xmath97 ) = ( @xmath98k , @xmath99k , @xmath100 ) , with @xmath90 and @xmath101k . treating the sz coefficient as an upper limit , and assuming the sz signal is uncorrelated with the primary anisotropy , we conclude that not more than 10/35 , or 30% , of the dmr variance could be due to distortions from the sunyaev - zeldovich effect at 95% cl .",
    "this corresponds to an upper limit of @xmath102 @xmath18k = 18 @xmath18k , or @xmath103 for @xmath0 fluctuations on a 7@xmath63 angular scale , consistent with the limit on a uniform sz distortion of @xmath104 ( mather  1994 ) .",
    "banday  ( 1996 ) cross - correlated the 4-year dmr maps with a variety of extra - galactic sources including abell clusters and heao x - ray data and found no evidence for correlated emission .",
    "they placed a 95% cl upper limit of @xmath105 for hot gas correlated with those particular sources .",
    "the limits obtained here are higher in amplitude , but make no assumption about the spatial distribution of the gas and are based on direct measurements of the spectrum in the wien region where the sz distortion is manifest .",
    "the limit on the dust fluctuations that are traced by dmr but _ not _ by dirbe depend on the spectral properties of the assumed dust : we have fit @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 for a variety of dust properties and have computed the corresponding upper limits on @xmath0 fluctuations at 90 ghz . with @xmath106",
    "we find @xmath107 2.0 , 0.4 , 0.3 @xmath18k for @xmath86 = 5 , 10 , 15 k respectively , and with @xmath90 we find @xmath107 0.4 , 0.1 , 0.05 @xmath18k for @xmath86 = 5 , 10 , 15 k respectively .",
    "to complement the above spectral analysis , we now assume the spectral form of the cmb anisotropy in the firas data and derive a map of the cmb temperature .",
    "the resulting map is then compared to the dmr map using a cross correlation analysis .",
    "we assess the statistical consistency of the two anisotropy maps with the aid of monte carlo simulations .",
    "to obtain a map of the cmb temperature , the firas sky spectra are simultaneously fit to three spectral forms to derive three corresponding maps . as before ,",
    "we model the data as @xmath108 where @xmath11 k is the mean cmb temperature .",
    "the first two terms represent a planck cmb signal with temperature @xmath109 , and the last two terms represent galactic emission with two independent dust spectra , @xmath40 and @xmath41 . here",
    "we take @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "( there is little difference in the anisotropy map if we use a different dust spectrum , as long as it allows for temperature variation across the sky . )",
    "the spectral data are fit to this model independently in each pixel resulting in maps @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 .",
    "the galactic maps are of limited interest since the fits use only the low frequency firas data . the anisotropy map , @xmath64 , which has units of thermodynamic temperature , is dominated by the dipole variation in the cmb .",
    "the agreement between the firas dipole and the dmr dipole has already been established ( fixsen  1996 ; bennett  1996 ) .",
    "the fits here confirm that agreement and verify that the relative calibration of the dmr and firas instruments agree to within 0.5% , consistent with the individual calibration uncertainties in each instrument . in our cross - correlation analysis",
    "we remove the dipole from the maps by fitting for a dipole component on the portion of the sky that is being analyzed . also , as in the spectral analysis , we smooth the firas anisotropy map , @xmath64 , with a 7@xmath63 fwhm gaussian to approximate the response of the dmr beam .",
    "the 2-point cross - correlation function is the average product of all pixel temperatures with a fixed angular separation : @xmath115 where the sum is over all pixel pairs ( @xmath116 ) separated by @xmath87 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 are pixel weights appropriate to the firas and dmr maps ( to minimize noise , we adopt inverse variance weighting ) , and @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the temperatures in pixels @xmath121 and @xmath122 of the firas and dmr maps respectively .",
    "we bin the correlation data into 71 angular separation bins of width @xmath123 .",
    "the data are analyzed with galactic cuts from 10@xmath63 to 40@xmath63 to determine the extent to which galactic emission is affecting the results .",
    "the 2-point functions obtained from the maps are shown in figure 3 .",
    "we plot the auto - correlation functions of the firas and dmr maps , and the cross correlation between the two .",
    "the error bar attached to each point represents the @xmath0 due to instrument noise and to modeled systematic effects in the firas anisotropy map .",
    "the plot demonstrates that : 1 ) the cross correlation of the firas and dmr maps is consistent with the dmr auto - correlation function , and 2 ) the firas auto - correlation function exhibits structure that is not present in the dmr map .",
    "the latter point is not surprising : signals of @xmath124k were expected . the  de - striping \" process in the firas data can leave artifacts of this size since the overall mission temperature calibration drift is a factor of @xmath125100 larger than the artifacts seen here .",
    "fortunately any residual instrumental effects in the firas anisotropy map are uncorrelated with the dmr and are less than the statistical noise per pixel , thus they should only contribute modest additional noise to the cross - correlation function .",
    "the residual stripes in the map may be described by a pixel - pixel covariance matrix .",
    "our monte carlo based error analysis includes both instrument noise and residual stripes as errors in the firas map .",
    "we test the consistency of the cross - correlation against the dmr auto - correlation quantitatively as follows .",
    "the statistic for the test is defined as @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the observed difference between a pair of 2-point functions , and @xmath128 is the covariance matrix computed from simulations .",
    "specifically @xmath129 has elements @xmath130 where @xmath131 denotes an angular separation bin , and @xmath132 and @xmath133 denote the cross- and auto - correlation functions respectively .",
    "we generate an ensemble of 2-point functions for computing the covariance as follows : for each realization we compute a scale - invariant power - law sky map with a quadrupole normalization of 18 @xmath18k , and filter it through the window function appropriate to each instrument s beam profile .",
    "we generate 2 noise maps , one per instrument , with appropriate noise level and coverage ( bennett et al .",
    "1996 ) , and , in the case of firas , one additional stripe map .",
    "each realization of the firas signal + noise + stripes is smoothed with the 7@xmath63 fwhm gaussian .",
    "the result is two maps with a common cmb signal , but different instrumental properties .",
    "we then compute the auto - correlation of each map , and the cross correlation of the pair to form an ensemble of simulated 2-point functions . from this",
    "we compute an ensemble of differences , @xmath127 , and their covariance , * m*.    the first column of table 1 shows the value of @xmath51 we obtain for the difference between the cross - correlation and the dmr auto - correlation for two galaxy cuts .",
    "this column also shows the fraction of simulated 2-point functions that had a larger difference , as measured by this statistic .",
    "clearly , by this measure , there is substantial agreement between the two maps .",
    "another measure of consistency is the quadrupole normalization of a scale - invariant signal fit to the auto and cross - correlation functions , using the method described in hinshaw et al .",
    "these results are also given in table 1 .",
    "the normalization derived from the dmr auto - correlation , denoted @xmath134 , is consistent with the value given in hinshaw et al .",
    "the normalization derived from the firas - dmr cross - correlation , @xmath135 , is consistent with the dmr normalization while it is inconsistent with zero , which rejects the null hypothesis that the two maps are uncorrelated .",
    "since the error associated with each determination of @xmath136 in this method includes a contribution from cosmic variance , we have also quoted results for the normalization difference , @xmath137 , for which the error depends only on instrument noise and systematic effects .",
    "the normalization inferred from the cross correlation function is lower than the dmr normalization by roughly 1.5 standard deviations , which is consistent with the results obtained from the spectral analysis .",
    "the mean firas spectrum of the anisotropy observed by dmr is consistent with the planck form , @xmath138 , expected of cmb anisotropy .",
    "conversely , the spatial distribution of the firas data fit to a planck spectrum agrees well with the dmr anisotropy .",
    "taken together , these results provide direct observational support for the widely held view that the signal first detected by the dmr is , in fact , temperature anisotropy in the cmb .",
    "observations of the dipole anisotropy corroborate the relative calibration of the two experiments to within 0.5% . we have used the anisotropy spectrum to place limits on the fraction of the dmr signal that could be due to comptonization by hot gas via the sunyaev - zeldovich effect .",
    "we find that no more than 18 @xmath18k of the signal seen by dmr could be due to this mechanism at 95% cl .",
    "this corresponds to an upper limit on @xmath0 fluctuations in the compton @xmath7 parameter of @xmath8 on @xmath9 angular scales , and rules out models in which the anisotropy is primarily due to the sz effect .",
    "we also limit fluctuations in thermal dust emission that are traced by dmr but _ not _ by dirbe to less than 2 @xmath18k at 90 ghz .",
