    "a simple way to achieve a phantom model is to take a scalar field lagrangian with a negative kinetic term .",

    ". then equation ( [ exact1 ] ) becomes @xmath43 this is identical to the equation one obtains , in the corresponding limit , for @xmath38 for quintessence @xcite .",

    "the fact that these two different models ( phantom and quintessence ) yield an identical form for @xmath52 is not _ a priori _ obvious ; indeed , this result is valid only in the  slow roll \" limit considered here .",
    "we now compare the approximation given in equation ( [ wpred ] ) to exact numerical results .",
    "kujat et al .",
    "@xcite showed that phantom potentials with a negative kinetic term can be divided into three broad classes , depending on the late - time asymptotic behavior of @xmath53 .",
    "when @xmath54 at late times , @xmath55 .",
    "these models include , for instance , negative power laws . for models in which @xmath42 asymptotically approaches a constant",
    ", @xmath2 also approaches a constant , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 .",
    "this class of models includes exponential potentials .",
    "finally , when @xmath58 at late times , @xmath59 .",
    "this class of models includes , for example , positive power law potentials .",
    "this final class of models , for which @xmath60 , can be further subdivided into models which yield a future singularity ( a  big rip \" ) , and those which do not .",
    "the exact conditions necessary to avoid a big rip involve an integral function of @xmath12 @xcite , but for power - law potentials , the condition is simpler : for @xmath61 , @xmath62 yields a big rip , while @xmath63 yields no future singularity @xcite .",
    "we have therefore chosen to compare our analytic approximation for @xmath4 with a model from each of these four classes .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "1 . as in the case of quintessence , the agreement between the actual evolution and our approximation in equation ( [ wpred ] ) is remarkably good , with the error in @xmath2 less than 0.5% .",
    "our analytic approximation is well - fit by a linear relation , @xcite @xmath64 in the regime @xmath65 , which corresponds to a redshift @xmath66 .",
    "further , for the value of @xmath67 adopted here ( @xmath68 ) , we have @xmath8 .",
    "this is the same relation between @xmath69 and @xmath56 noted empirically for linear quintessence potentials @xcite , predicted for generic slow - roll quintessence models @xcite , and derived analytically for linear quintessence potentials @xcite .",
    "( note that the latter reference gives a value of @xmath70 rather than @xmath71 , but this difference is not significant , as the result depends on the assumed value of @xmath48 and on the assumed definition of @xmath69 ; the latter is ambiguous since @xmath4 is not exactly linear in @xmath15 in these models ) .",
    "given that equation ( [ wpred ] ) provides a generic prediction for the behavior of @xmath4 in a wide class of phantom models , it is useful to compare this prediction to the observations . further , since both quintessence and phantom models produce the same generic form for @xmath4 in the limit where @xmath42 is small and nearly constant , we can combine the results for @xmath4 for quintessence models from ref .",
    "@xcite with the results for @xmath4 for phantom models given here into a single likelihood plot . in fig .",
    "2 , we compare this generic prediction for @xmath4 to the snia and baryon acoustic oscillation data .",
    "the likelihoods were constructed using the 60 essence supernovae , 57 snls ( supernova legacy survey ) and 45 nearby supernovae , and the data release of 30 sne ia detected by hst and classified as the gold sample by riess et al . @xcite .",
    "the combined dataset can be found in ref .",
    "we also add the measurement of the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) scale at @xmath72 as observed by the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that fig .",
    "2 combines two completely different models .",
    "the portion of the figure with @xmath73 corresponds to quintessence models , while @xmath57 corresponds to phantom models .",
    "we have simply taken advantage of the fact that both models yield the same form for @xmath4 as a function of @xmath56 and @xmath67 in the limiting case where the potential is nearly flat .",
    "our main conclusion is that the analytic approximation previous derived for quintessence with a nearly flat potential @xcite has the same form when it is extended to phantom models with a negative kinetic term .",
    "thus , the generic prediction for the evolution @xmath2 at low redshift ( @xmath6 ) in such models , @xmath74 , can be applied to both @xmath73 and @xmath57 .",
