    "analyses targeting _",
    "e.g. _ spin and @xmath8   of the new particle and a more precise extraction of its couplings to known matter will be addressed with a larger data sample .",
    "the current observations leave open a plurality of phenomenological possibilities of higgs sector - modifications  .",
    "especially the extraction of the resonance s couplings is influenced by non - standard decays   since it is based on a fit to combinations of various production @xmath9 and decay modes @xmath10 .",
    "these are functions of the partial and total decay widths and _ all _ couplings @xmath11 : @xmath12 the total width @xmath13 in current fits is typically approximated by including a freely flowing invisible partial width @xcite to the list of decay modes or by imposing the constraint @xmath14 .",
    "extracting such an invisible ) `` invisible '' also means fully visible in a non - standard search channel . ] or partially visible branching ratio is an experimentally ambitious task . the decay of the higgs via a light scalar or pseudo - scalar @xmath2 can be buried in a large hadronic background , experimental systematics can limit the sensitivity to such decays , and non - sm phenomenology can easily be missed .",
    "the signature @xmath15 occurs in many extensions of the sm , _",
    "e.g. _ , the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model  , higgs - portal models  , and whenever an approximate symmetry of the higgs potential is explicitly broken by a small term in the potential , giving a light pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson ( see   for a clear discussion ) .",
    "however the signature can be missed by standard searches , depending on how @xmath2 itself decays , and new dedicated strategies need to be devised .",
    "obviously , an observation of such a novel decay channel @xmath15 would directly imply physics beyond the standard model .",
    "subjet methods ( pioneered in ref .  ) have proven particularly successful in getting a handle on such a modified phenomenology .",
    "in particular , subjet analyses applied to the decay chains @xmath16 have unravelled potential sensitivity to these non - standard decays if the ( pseudo)scalar @xmath2 is light @xmath17 . a decay of the higgs to @xmath18 is well motivated on general grounds ; one can keep a reasonably open mind with regards to how the @xmath18 subsequently decay .",

    "higgs decays into resonances with masses close to hadronic bound states have been studied in refs .  .",
    "sensitivity to the signatures discussed in refs",
    ".   follows from fundamentally distinct qcd and electroweak properties , highlighting the diverse power that jet substructure - based approaches offer .",
    "there is one major difference in the analysis of purely hadronic final states compared to electroweak final states .",
    "quite often the latter involve a significant amount of missing energy , which is aligned with the direction of the fat jet that is input to grooming and/or tagging algorithms  .",
    "normally such an event topology is avoided to minimize systematic uncertainties . in , _ e.g. _ , searches for supersymmetry in the jets+missing energy channel   one requires a missing energy vector @xmath23 well isolated from a number of hard jets , to reduce systematics .",
    "decays @xmath15 with @xmath24 , on the other hand , naturally involve non - isolation of @xmath23 , which might even be not too large depending on the decay of @xmath2 . in the phase space region where we can separate signal from background a susy - inspired search strategy based on a strong @xmath23 isolation becomes impossible .",
    "strategies to deal with non - sm higgs decays involving both missing and hadronic energy @xcite are , hence , limited .",
    "a direct generalization of the standard invisible higgs decay search in the weak boson fusion channel   is not possible .",
    "such an analysis relies on a central jet veto to obtain a sufficiently large signal - over - background ratio @xmath25 to study the jets azimuthal angle correlation .",
    "applying a central jet veto to central decay @xmath26+hadrons removes the signal that we would like to investigate .",
    "adapted higgs+monojet searches @xcite are challenged by overwhelmingly large dijet and weak boson+jet backgrounds and trigger issues , as soon as missing energy from invisible higgs decays decreases when turning to a partially visible decay .",
    "the latter can at least be partially cured by focussing on the higgs @xmath27-distribution s tail .",
    "this , however , comes at the price of larger theoretical and experimental uncertainties , which imperatively need to be included to reach a realistic formulation of the branching ratio constraints .",
    "this leaves higgs - strahlung @xmath28 as the best - motivated channel to study the situation we have in mind at the lhc .",
    "trigger issues are avoided by reconstructing the leptonic @xmath29 decay and no further adjustments to the trigger settings or thresholds are necessary to perform the measurement(this process is also studied in the context of invisible higgs searches  ) .",
    "furthermore , the jet energy scale calibration is performed with @xmath30+jet events , whose distribution is both theoretically and experimentally under good control  .",
    "data - driven methods can be straightforwardly applied in `` abcd '' approaches , when _",

    "this choice is not special and the details of eventually extracting the branching ratio is not sensitive to the particular value @xmath41 unless @xmath42 .",

    "requires the simulation of a realistic detector environment , and should be addressed by the experiments .",
    "however , we may assume on the basis of refs .  @xcite that this background can be brought under sufficient control and can be subtracted from the eventual distribution also when the missing energy vector is collinear to the jet .",

    "doing so , we reconstruct the full three - momenta from the detector geometry with an invariant mass @xmath53 for each ecal+hcal cell , which contains a single or multiple hits .    in the analysis , we first reconstruct isolated stable leptons , by requiring the hadronic energy deposit in the vicinity of the lepton candidate ( @xmath54 , where @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle respectively ) to be smaller than 10% of the lepton candidate s transverse momentum .",
    "we furthermore require exactly two leptons ( @xmath57 ) of identical flavor and opposite charge that recombine the @xmath30 mass within @xmath58  gev ( note that this also removes higher - pronged @xmath59 events ) and demand @xmath60 .",
    "subsequently , we cluster cambridge / aachen jets with @xmath61 using   and we require at least one such fat jet with @xmath62 .",
    "we apply the mass drop and asymmetry criteria to this jet as explained in ref .",

    "furthermore , the jet needs to pass a @xmath34-veto in @xmath63 , for which we choose a working point   with a flat 70% tagging efficiency and a flat 10% fake rate .",

    "( [ eq : resol ] ) is a conservative baseline for the 14 tev run at luminosities at which the limits on the brs will be stringent .",

    "trimming can remove too much of the signal when the light final state quark pairs are relatively widely separated in scenario ( a ) .",
    "when focussing on scenarios with an increasingly large amount of @xmath23 compared to hadronic activity , sensitivity decreases . this is a consequence of the applied subjet analysis , which requires by definition a significant amount of a hadronic energy . depending on the scenario",
    "we therefore become increasingly sensitive to uncorrelated initial state radiation and underlying event splash - in which degrades the mass resolution , while filtering and trimming serve to suppress part of the pollution from underlying event .",

    "this is mostly due to the very limited possibilities to improve @xmath25 and the poor mass resolution that can be obtained from a signature that predominantly governed by missing energy in a channel whose diboson backgrounds also contain a sizable amount of @xmath73 .    turning to final states that contain more hadronic energy fig .",

    "an alternative route for putting limits on scenario ( c ) , where hadronic energy correlations in the fat jet s substructure can be resolved , is exploiting the fat jet s `` active area '' ( see also ref .  ) in a way that also incorporates the correlation with the missing energy .",

    "current fits limit the invisible branching ratio to be @xmath95 .",
    "since all of our signatures are missed in standard searches , our scenarios are constrained by this loose bound , so that there is the possibility to find light scalars in that particular mass range in the near future .",
    "after the discovery of the higgs - like resonance at around 125 gev , a further investigation of the resonance s compatibility with the sm expectation is ongoing .",
    "a precise measurement of the resonance s couplings to sm matter depends on the treatment of non - standard partial decay widths , which is typically performed in global fit to the quantitative in different exclusive higgs final states .",
    "non - standard situations are hereby often treated as a nuisance .",
    "hence , the necessity to investigate non - sm phenomenological situations is imperative : if an indication of a non - zero branching ratio in a specific channel is accessed in a direct measurement , the evidence for physics beyond the sm will be accompanied by an insight in its particular realization as opposed to a mere parametrization of @xmath96 in eq .",
    "( [ decaywidth ] ) as part of a global fit .",
    "this inevitably comes at the price of a decreased sensitivity ( _ i.e. _ less stringent limits ) which results from investigating a single channel as opposed to combinations and correlations of many .",
    "we have investigated the possibility to constrain non - standard branching ratios via direct measurements for a broad range of effective models , which contain both invisible and visible final state particles in this paper .",
    "gaining sensitivity to these phenomenological situations is characterized by a number of shortcomings , that range from trigger issues all the way to the higgs mass reconstruction at a reasonable signal - over - background ratio . since trigger thresholds",
    "are typically bound to hardware specifications , we devise an analysis strategy which builds upon associated production and a boosted higgs final state . as a consequence ,",
    "we need to deal with an event topology where missing energy is collimated with the visible higgs decay products in decays @xmath15 with @xmath97 ( a choice @xmath98 exhibits too much @xmath23-jet decorrelation to facilitate signal reconstruction on top of a large background rejection ) .",
    "recent investigations targeting the reconstruction of @xmath23 based on particle - flow as well as the extraction of fake @xmath23 from a combination of theory and experiment suggest that systematics can be brought under sufficient control to perform such analyses in this particular channel .",
    "we find that , depending on the specific realization of the partially visible higgs decay ( which is characterized by different @xmath73-jet substructure correlations ) bounds as good as @xmath3 can be obtained from a measurement of boosted higgs final states , applying a rather generic cut set up which serves to obtain a reasonable @xmath25 .",
    "constraints can subsequently be obtained from an optimal choice of observable which , depending on the amount of visible final state energy , also allows to partially reconstruct parts of the higgs potential decay chain .",
