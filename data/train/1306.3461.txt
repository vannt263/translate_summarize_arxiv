    "the precise control of both the internal and external degrees of freedom of cold and ultra - cold molecules is very attractive and promises new insights and advances in various domains of physics @xcite and modern physical chemistry @xcite .",
    "several theoretical approaches have been proposed to control the internal degrees of freedom of cold molecules , such as the use of an external cavity to favor spontaneous emission toward the lowest ro - vibrational level @xcite or the controlled interplay of coherent laser fields and spontaneous emission through quantum interferences between different transitions @xcite . from the experimental point of view , molecules are more difficult to control than atoms because of their complex internal structure",
    ". however , cold molecule formation has been achieved by different approaches that can be roughly grouped into two main classes : direct cooling of preformed molecules and indirect cold molecule formation by assembling cold or ultra - cold atoms @xcite . in summary ,",
    "two major challenges have been faced , the first being the decrease of the translational temperature of molecules in analogy with atom cooling and the second being the reduction of the internal rovibronic energy .",
    "ultimately , experimental efforts have been focused on the control of the external degrees of freedom , leading to impressive achievements : one - dimensional transverse laser cooling @xcite , longitudinal slowing @xcite of a srf beam , and more recently , one- and two - dimensional laser cooling with magneto - optical trapping of polar yo molecules @xcite , sisyphus cooling of electrically trapped polyatomic ch@xmath1f molecules @xcite and evaporative cooling of molecules @xcite .",
    "other techniques have been also developed to coherently transfer molecular populations from an hyperfine level to another one ( cs@xmath2 @xcite , krb @xcite ) .    in our laboratory",
    ", we have been able to produce cs@xmath2 molecules with low translational energy ( t @xmath3 ) by photo - association of ultra - cold cs atoms as soon as 1998 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , those molecules have a substantial residual internal energy because the decay of the electronically excited state used in the photo - association process generally leads to populate several vibrational and rotational levels .",
    "we have only recently achieved the transfer and the accumulation of molecules to a single rovibrational level of the electronic ground state @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to describe the basics of our method that is , in summary , based on a broadband and incoherent optical source designed to modify the distribution of the ro - vibrational populations .",
    "our approach is actually a follow up of the so called `` luminorefrigeration '' process proposed by kastler @xcite in 1950 to accumulate sodium atoms in the lowest state of the hyperfine manifold .",
    "later on , it was also proposed to lower the `` j '' value of cs@xmath2 molecules @xcite .",
    "the principle is quite simple and general and has been successfully applied to decrease the vibrational temperature of nacs @xcite and cool molecular ions @xcite . in all these works , molecules",
    "present in several levels are optically excited and decay to other levels as long as they reach a target level which is not accessible ( `` dark '' ) to the optical excitation .",
    "such an attainment has required great efforts to find out appropriate schemes and consequent technical hints for both the excitation and detection .",
    "for the vibrational cooling of cs@xmath2 molecules , these details have been already reported . on the other hand , rotational cooling of cs@xmath2",
    "is a more subtle process given that the molecular vibration is likely to be affected .",
    "finding a solution for simultaneous rotational and vibrational cooling has been achieved and it is described in the following sections . this article is organized in the following way . in section 2 , we explain the general photo - association process producing bound molecules and we describe our detection methods that is crucial for the diagnostics . in section 3 , the vibrational cooling of translational cold cs@xmath2 molecules obtained by an improved laser shaping is presented . in section 4 , we describe spectroscopic investigations of the cs@xmath2 rotational structure and simulations relevant for the rotational cooling . in section 5 ,",
    "we report the details of the simultaneous vibrational and rotational cooling by optical pumping methods .",
    "photoassociation ( pa ) of atoms in atomic vapors is a well - known process @xcite . in the specific case of cesium ,",
    "a pair of atoms in hyperfine level @xmath4 of the @xmath5 ground state absorbs one photon of suitable energy h@xmath6 , red - detuned from the energy of the atomic transition ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 or @xmath9 ) to create molecules in a rovibrational level ( @xmath10,@xmath11 ) of an excited electronic state @xmath12 related to one of the asymptotic ( @xmath13 ) or ( @xmath14 ) according to the reaction    @xmath15    for atoms at room temperature , the pa process does not allow to resolve the excited state level structure because the width of the maxwell - boltzmann kinetic energy distribution of the atoms , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is the boltzman constant and @xmath18 the temperature of the atomic sample ) , is much larger than the energy spacing in the excited state @xcite .",
    "on the contrary , due to the extremely narrow width of the thermal distribution of ultracold atoms ( @xmath19 mhz at @xmath20 @xmath21k ) , smaller than the energy spacing between molecular bound levels , and more importantly , very often narrower than the level width of the excited states , photo - association of cold atoms has proven to be a powerful tool for high - resolution molecular spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "it has given access to the previously unexplored domain of molecular dynamics at distances well beyond those of well - known chemical bonds .",
    "indeed , the photo - association process occurs at large inter - atomic distances @xmath22 , i.e. roughly at the classical outer turning point of the final vibrational level , where a pair of identical ground state atoms interact through their van der waals interaction behaving as @xmath23 . when the atom pair is excited , the dipole - dipole interaction is dominant , and varies as @xmath24 .",
    "vibrational levels with a very large elongation ( beyond @xmath25 a@xmath26 ) are then efficiently populated by photo - association .",
    "it is useful to characterize the pa process by the rate of excitation per atom in the sample , r@xmath27 , which is generally proportional to @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the pa laser irradiance , @xmath30 is the franck - condon factor describing the overlap between the initial free state and the final bound state , @xmath31 is the phase space density @xcite .",
    "depending on the shape of the potential curve of the excited state , the excited molecules decay , with typical times of the order of tens of nanoseconds , by a spontaneous emission into two free `` hot '' atoms with a large relative kinetic energy , or into rovibrational levels of the lowest stable electronic states , which is the case of interest for the production of translationally cold molecules .",
    "the core of our experiments is a cs vapor - loaded mot , where @xmath33 atoms are continuously laser - cooled and trapped at a temperature of t@xmath34 @xmath21k and at a peak density of @xmath35 @xmath36 .",
    "pa is achieved using a cw titanium : sapphire laser ( intensity @xmath37 w.@xmath38 ) pumped by an ar@xmath39 laser .",
    "the pa scheme used to prepare cold cesium molecules in the x@xmath32 state ( singlet ground electronic state hereafter referred to as x ) , schematically shown in figure [ pa]a ) was verified by a spectroscopic study using a broadband laser radiation as described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the pa laser excites the atom pair to the ( @xmath10 , @xmath40 ) rovibrational level at 11730.1245 @xmath41 about 2 @xmath41 below the @xmath42 asymptote of the lowest @xmath43 long - range molecular potential . at short distances ,",
    "this state is coupled to the lowest @xmath44 ) potential curve through several avoided crossings induced by spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the @xmath45 level of this curve is predicted to be very close to the @xmath46 dissociation energy .",
    "it is surely the only populated short - range level in this process which allows for a decay to the x ground state through a two - photon spontaneous emission cascade via the @xmath47 potentials , and finally producing nearly @xmath48 molecules per second . on the contrary",
    ", one - photon spontaneous emission favors the decay to levels of the triplet a@xmath49 state as reported in the first observation of the formation of translationally cold molecules @xcite .",
    "the triplet ground electronic state , however , at the average distance @xmath50 a@xmath26 corresponds to the range of the repulsive wall so that only dissociating pairs could be formed .",
    "more recently , another mechanism of formation of cesium molecules in the ground singlet electronic state has been found @xcite . in this mechanism , shown in figure[pa]b ) , the pa laser is set to excite long range vibrational levels belonging to the @xmath51 state . in the first @xmath52 @xmath53 below the atomic asymptote ,",
    "vibrational levels are coupled to some inner potential curves presumably belonging to the upper @xmath54 and @xmath55 states .",
    "since the @xmath56 is a state of gerade symmetry , any one - photon spontaneous decay ends up either into the @xmath57 ground state or into the @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 components of the @xmath61 or b@xmath62 state located at intermediate energies .",
    "the 2@xmath63 state should be metastable , nevertheless , a resonant coupling with the @xmath64(a@xmath65 ) state allows for a decay of the @xmath64(b@xmath62 ) component into the x ground state .",
    "whereas the cs@xmath2 molecules undergo a ballistic expansion and fall under the influence of gravity , a detection can be efficiently performed by resonance enhanced multi - photon ionization ( rempi ) .",
    "this method relies on a selective production of molecular ions that are quickly extracted from the mot region by a static electric field and detected by a pair of micro - channel plates ( mcps ) through a time - of - flight mass spectrometer .",
    "as the ionization is based on resonant excitations , it is possible to get spectra by scanning the wavelength of the exciting pulsed dye laser pumped by the second harmonic of a pulsed nd : yag laser ( repetition rate @xmath66 hz , duration @xmath67 ns ) . in the case of cs@xmath68 , the spectral bandwidth ( @xmath69 @xmath53 ) of the pulsed dye laser limits the resolution of the spectra to the vibrational structure .",
    "electronic states generally involved in the rempi process are schematically shown in figure [ detection1 ] : in the @xmath70 @xmath71 energy range , the ionization of deeply bound molecules in the x state proceeds via the c@xmath72 state and the d@xmath73 state . in figure [ pispectrum ]",
    "the assignment of the observed ionization lines is done according to the known spectroscopy @xcite . in brief , this method , fully satisfying for vibrational analysis , is not sufficient to get information about the rotational distribution . further necessary refinement in this perspective",
    "will be discussed in section 4 .",
    "experiments show that cold photo - associated molecules produced in the ground singlet x state are distributed over low vibrational levels @xmath74 and relatively high rotational levels @xmath75 when associated through the @xmath43 potential ( see figure [ pa]a . ) while they are distributed over high vibrational levels @xmath76 and low rotational levels @xmath77 when associated through the @xmath78(@xmath79 ) ( shown in figure [ pa]b . )",
    "one example of such photo - ionization spectrum is shown in figure [ pispectrum ] .",
    "starting from this observation , one of our first goal was to transfer these molecules in a well - defined vibrational level and , if possible , in the ground vibrational one .",
    "the main idea of the vibrational pumping demonstrated for cs@xmath68 molecules in @xcite and recently for nacs molecules @xcite consists in using a broadband laser tuned to the transitions between the different vibrational levels @xmath80 and the levels belonging to an electronically excited state , namely the b@xmath81 state in the cesium case . starting from a given vibrational distribution of @xmath80 ,",
    "the aim is to transfer it into a single target vibrational level .",
    "we have first demonstrated this transfer of population from the vibrational levels of cold singlet - ground - state cs@xmath82 molecules , towards the level , @xmath80 = @xmath83 , with no vibration @xcite .",
    "each absorption - spontaneous emission cycle lead , through optical pumping , to a new distribution of the vibrational population in the different vibrational levels of the ground state according to    @xmath84    @xmath85 and @xmath86 are , respectively , the laser frequency and the frequency of the spontaneously emitted photons .",
    "the broadband character of the laser enables the repetition of the pumping process from multiple vibrational @xmath80 levels . depending on the wavelength , we observe a modification of the molecular resonance lines interpreted as a transfer of population between vibrational levels through optical pumping . by removing the laser frequencies corresponding to the excitation of a selected @xmath80 level , pumping molecules out of this level",
    "is made impossible such that it can be considered as a dark state .",
    "progressively , the repetition of the absorption - spontaneous emission cycles lead to an accumulation of the molecules in the chosen @xmath80 level @xcite . in our first report on vibrational cooling by optical pumping cycles",
    "@xcite were sufficient to accumulate molecules into @xmath80 = 0 .",
    "this result is confirmed by the present simulation .",
    "taking intensity and spectral shape values close to the experimental ones , it evaluates the total number of photons ( laser plus spontaneous emission ) , necessary for vibrational cooling from a given @xmath80 toward @xmath80 = 0 . as shown in figure [ photons ] , roughly 10 photons , corresponding to the 5 laser cycles of our first experiment , are required to achieve vibrational cooling from level with ( @xmath87 10 ) .",
    "the suppression of the optical frequencies to make dark a chosen state is obtained by spectral shaping the broadband laser .",
    "this shaping is realized by a simple 4-@xmath88 imaging system which is schematically represented in figure [ 4-fline ] .",
    "the broadband laser is sent to a diffraction grating ( @xmath89 lines / mm ) that spatially splits the different frequency components .",
    "the resulting beam is then collimated by a @xmath25 mm cylindrical lens and selectively reflected back by a mirror placed at focal length @xmath88 from the grating , i.e. in the fourier plane of the optical system .",
    "the laser spectrum being spatially spread over the whole mirror , a spatial mask or any means preventing the reflection locally leads to remove frequency components .",
    "ultimately , the frequency selection is obtained by using an array of rotatable micro - mirrors ( dlp texas instruments discovery .55 xga 2xlvds 120type x customer ) that can be orientated according to two different angles .",
    "thus , the frequency components necessary for the optical pumping are reflected back whereas those corresponding to the excitation from the dark state are rejected by a proper mirror tilt .",
    "it is noteworthy that if @xmath90 is the dark state , the shaping can be obtained by a simple cut off above @xmath91 in the laser spectrum ( low - pass optical filter ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ piwithrv ] , the application of the shaped laser strongly modifies the photo - ionization spectrum .",
    "intense resonance lines reveal a net increase of population in @xmath92 compared to the original pa spectrum .",
    "the ranging applicability of this method exceeds the latter case and was demonstrated for many vibrational levels ( @xmath80 = @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath67 ) by more complex laser shaping @xcite .",
    "the obvious limitation lies upon the available laser bandwidth and upon the initial molecular distribution : molecules reaching or initially lying in vibrational levels out of the range of the optical frequencies , escape from the pumping process .",
    "several approaches can be implemented to optimize the spectral shaping . at some stage , they all require a simple criterion to keep or reject a given transition frequency .",
    "for example , a criterion that we often used was to choose the highest q@xmath95 factors between the target vibrational level and the excited states , and reject all the others . in general",
    ", it is thus useful to have access to the q@xmath95 factors to optimize the pumping process . in order to model the process , the optical cycle",
    "is divided in two steps : the excitation ( absorption ) from x to b , and the spontaneous emission b to x. in a perturbative approach ( low laser intensity ) , the distribution of molecules in the various vibrational levels is described in absorption by    @xmath96    and in emission by    @xmath97    p@xmath98 and p@xmath99 respectively denote the population of the vibrational levels @xmath100 and @xmath101 of the ground and the excited electronic states at the stage number @xmath102 of the process .",
    "a@xmath103 denotes the ratio at which molecular populations are transferred from one vibrational level @xmath100 to any @xmath101 accessible by our laser bandwidth .",
    "similarly , e@xmath104 denotes the molecular population decay by spontaneous emission from one vibrational level @xmath101 to @xmath100 .",
    "these rates are proportional to :    @xmath105    @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 correspond to the franck - condon coefficient , the dipole moment and the transition frequency of the vibrational transition , respectively . as a consequence , after n steps of absorption emission cycles ,    @xmath109    with m@xmath110 .",
    "+ for example , a very simple optimization procedure to pump toward a single level @xmath111 is to set the laser intensity ( @xmath112 ) either on or off .",
    "we can then write @xmath113 where @xmath114 for laser off and @xmath115 for laser on .",
    "the criterion is that p@xmath116 has to get closer to p@xmath117 , a target distribution defined by @xmath118 .",
    "it means that we have to minimize the l@xmath119 norm    @xmath120    noting that if @xmath121 , @xmath122 , we just have to choose @xmath123 .",
    "therefore , @xmath111 is a dark state and can not interact with the laser .",
    "but if @xmath124 , and then the minimization of @xmath125 implies that @xmath126 , i.e. the laser is turned on to excite all the population lying in vibrational levels @xmath127 .",
    "in principle , the rotational distribution of cold molecules could be observed also without vibrational cooling but , after photoassociation , only a small number of molecules is produced in any given vibrational level @xmath100 .",
    "it would be thus very difficult to resolve spectroscopically the rotational structure .",
    "that s why we apply a vibrational cooling phase before attempting to detect the rotation .",
    "when molecules are transferred to the ground vibrational level ( @xmath45 ) , they are still spread over several ( typically 4 - 6 ) rotational levels .",
    "the rotational splitting of cs@xmath68 levels is too narrow to be resolved with a pulsed dye laser because the linewidth is larger compared to the separation between two rotational levels ( @xmath128 mhz ) .",
    "other methods must be adopted to perform a rotational spectroscopy of our molecular sample .",
    "they are based on using a continuous narrow - band laser that can selectively excite a rotational level @xmath129 .",
    "the simplest detection method would be a direct ionization of the @xmath130 population after a very fast narrow - band laser pulse according to :    @xmath131    however , it is so tricky to generate such a short pulse of the required narrow - band laser , that we have used other detection methods .",
    "they are less obvious but more efficient .",
    "the idea of the depletion spectroscopy @xcite is to use a continuous - wave ( cw ) diode laser to deplete molecules from the ground vibrational level , while the loss is monitored by a rempi technique . in our experiment",
    ", we used a cw dfb laser scanned over the @xmath132 transitions as schematically shown in figure [ sample - figure]a ) .",
    "the franck - condon factors of this transition are not particularly strong but this choice was imposed by the wavelength of the dfb laser available in our laboratory .",
    "the population in @xmath45 evolves according to the following equations    @xmath133    a typical example of a depletion spectrum , obtained after 50 @xmath134s irradiation with the dfb laser is shown in figure [ sample - figure]b ) .",
    "the second detection method we used relies on measuring the spontaneous - decay - induced signal of a vibrational level of the ground electronic state having a good franck - condon @xmath30 factor with a vibrational level of the excited electronic state . in our experiment , @xmath135 has been chosen because its @xmath30 factor with @xmath136 is the largest available one ( @xmath137 ) as shown in table 1 , and because @xmath135 is efficiently emptied by the vibrational optical pumping .",
    "the @xmath135 population is probed by the pulsed dye laser through the @xmath138 ( vibrational transition ) .",
    "the various processes involved are    @xmath139    the scheme of the laser transitions used to detect the rotation with spidr method are shown in figure [ spidr ] .",
    "the main difference with the preceding depletion method is in the pulsed laser wavelength .    as in reference @xcite",
    ", we found that this method requires smaller power and shorter pulse duration than depletion spectroscopy .",
    "this may look surprising because those techniques only differ by the post - ionization step .",
    "the reason is that the spontaneous - decay - induced signal is almost background free whereas the depletion signal starts from the fluctuating signal of the @xmath140 population which strongly alters the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "a first example of spectrum acquired by the spontaneous - decay - induced signal method is shown in figure [ sample - figure1 ] .",
    "as described above , photo - association through the @xmath141 state , leads to the formation of cold molecules in the x ground electronic state by two - photon decay through @xmath142 state .",
    "after the pa process , we apply the vibrational optical pumping to cool the vibration .",
    "when molecules are optically pumped in the ground vibrational level ( @xmath45 ) we detect the rotation distribution of molecules in this level .",
    "we then obtain the rotational spectrum shown in the lower panel of figure [ sample - figure1 ] .",
    "we note that only even or odd rotational states are populated .",
    "it is a strong proof that the cold molecule formation process is indeed two - photons decay .",
    "it can be easily explained by the fact that the rotational states have a ( + /-",
    ") parity given by the sign of @xmath143 in @xmath144 excited state and @xmath145 in the ground electronic state ( x ) .",
    "the parity conservation is also a piece of evidence that the vibrational optical pumping process using the b state does not change the parity @xcite .",
    "this also means that the two photon decay through @xmath146 state is not selective in parity , which is expected .",
    "we can also obtain spectra with both even and odd rotational states as shown in figure [ sample - figure1]c ) if @xmath147(@xmath148 ) is used for the pa process .",
    "this is possible because 1@xmath149 state has no definite parity .",
    "we also note that , in this case , the rotational distribution is centered around higher @xmath11 values , as the chosen pa level is @xmath11 = 8 .    with three different pa schemes : through a ) @xmath56 @xmath150 , b ) @xmath151 and c ) @xmath147 @xmath152 .",
    "the two first spectra reveal lines of a unique @xmath129 parity .",
    "[ sample - figure1 ]",
    "photoassociation on the @xmath153 state leads to significant population in the ground electronic state but spread out in more than @xmath154 vibrational levels . in order to observe the rotational population we need to increase the population in a given vibrational state . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown that the vibrational pumping toward @xmath155 is very efficient only for low vibrational levels ( @xmath156 ) . this result",
    "is confirmed by computing , via a numerical simulation , the pumping efficiency from a given @xmath100 toward @xmath157 as shown in figure [ evolutionpopulation ] .",
    "this threshold is only due to the limited laser bandwidth but implies that only 25% of the initial distribution is pumped into the @xmath157 level . as already evoked , molecules finally lying in ( @xmath157 ) are spread over @xmath158 four @xmath129 states ( figures [ sample - figure ] and [ sample - figure2 ] ) .",
    "the manipulation of the rotational populations is based on the same principle as that used to achieve the vibrational cooling scheme : a broadband laser excites all the rotational states except the one of interest where the molecules accumulate after spontaneous emission .",
    "however , in the case of a heavy molecule like cs@xmath2 , the rotational spectrum is too narrow to be resolved using a simple grating , and thus the resolution limitation must be improved .",
    "to do so , two distinct laser sources are actually simultaneously used . the first one , devoted to the vibrational cooling , is a broadband laser with its spectrum shaped by a grating and a selective element in the fourier plane .",
    "the second one is a narrow - bandwidth dfb diode laser , whose spectrum is artificially broadened by modulating the diode current to obtain a @xmath158 5 ghz uniform scan range .",

    "after a single absorption - spontaneous emission cycle , the rotational quantum number can decrease by two units or keep the same value , both with a similar probability , i.e. 1/2 .",
