    "in this paper we investigate the properties of the systems of randomly applied orientation preserving homeomorphisms of the compact interval @xmath0 $ ] . such a system can be considered as a skew product with a mixed topological - measure structure . in the base we do not need any topology ( although sometimes we have it ) , but",
    "we assume that we have there an ergodic measure preserving transformation of a probability space . in the fiber , which is an interval , we have orientation preserving homeomorphisms , depending in a measurable way on the point in the base .",
    "we are interested in the existence of almost global attractors which are graphs of measurable functions from the base to the fiber .",
    "when we speak of an attractor , we mean a set towards which almost all orbits converge , and the convergence is considered fiberwise ( only in the direction of a fiber ) .",
    "this agrees with the philosophy saying that the phase space is really only the fiber space ( here , the interval ) .",
    "those systems and their attractors can be looked upon from various points of view ( random systems , strange nonchaotic attractors , iterated function systems , nonautonomous systems , etc . ) , see  @xcite .",
    "our main result is a detailed description of the behavior of a certain one - parameter family of piecewise linear random homeomorphisms .",
    "however , we precede it with some general results , which can be applied to very general random systems of interval homeomorphisms .    note that 0 and 1 are fixed points of all orientation preserving homeomorphisms of @xmath0 $ ] , so the products of the base space with @xmath1 and with @xmath2 ( we will refer to those sets as _ level @xmath3 _ and _ level @xmath4 _ ) are invariant for the skew product .",
    "if they are attracting in the sense of negative fiberwise lyapunov exponent , one expects their basins of attraction to have positive measure .",
    "we prove that this is the case in a general situation , under some mild additional conditions .",
    "our proof uses the same ideas as the proof by bonifant and milnor  @xcite in the special case .",
    "in  @xcite the cases of attracting levels 0 and 1 ( when the fiber maps have negative schwarzian derivative ) and repelling levels 0 and 1 ( when the fiber maps have positive schwarzian derivative ) were considered separately . here",
    "we join them together and consider an invertible map in the base .",
    "the two opposite types of behavior are observed depending whether the time goes to @xmath5 or to @xmath6 .",
    "the common boundary of the basins of attraction of the levels 0 and 1 as the time goes to @xmath6 is a graph of a measurable function from the base to the interval , is a forward attractor ( statement   of theorem  [ main ] ) and a pullback attractor ( statement   of theorem  [ main ] ) for the system .    in this general theorem",
    "one needs an additional assumption that the maps in the fibers are kind of contractions almost everywhere .",
    "proving it is crucial in the study of this problem . in  @xcite",
    "this is achieved by the assumptions on schwarzian derivatives of the maps . in our one - parameter family of maps",
    "this requires a careful proof .",
    "in fact , the contraction we get is very weak ( although really it may turn out to be exponential almost everywhere ; this is unknown to us ) .    finally , we compare the invertible and non - invertible cases .",
    "although the attractor in the invertible case depends only on the past in the base , it vanishes when we forget about the past ( more precisely , it becomes the whole space ) .",
    "we call it _ the mystery of the vanishing attractor_. while we described it already in  @xcite , the system considered here is a much better illustration of this paradox .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec - basin ]",
    "we generalize the theorem of bonifant and milnor . in section",
    "[ time ] we consider a general system with an invertible map in the base and prove a general theorem about its properties . in section  [ bernoulli ]",
    "we prove additional properties of the skew product under the assumption that the system in the base is a bernoulli shift .",
    "in section  [ plh ] we define our family of piecewise linear homeomorphisms and prove its contraction properties . in section  [ sec - measures ]",
    "we investigate our family of systems from the point of view of invariant measures .",
    "in section  [ 2s1s ] we compare the invertible and noninvertible systems .",
    "let us conclude this section with an observation and some questions .",
    "in the theory of interval maps ( not random ) negative schwarzian derivative often substitutes expansion ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the same happens in  @xcite , where positive schwarzian derivative gives us a form of contraction .",
    "however , in our piecewise linear system we also get a kind of contraction . what is the source of it ?",
    "does it have anything to do with some property resembling negative schwarzian derivative ? can it be observed in non - random , say unimodal , maps ?",
    "let us start with a very general situation .",
    "let @xmath7 be some space ( later there will be an invariant measure on it ) , @xmath8 a map , @xmath9 $ ] , @xmath10 a skew product : @xmath11 , and let @xmath12 be the projection from @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "we assume that each @xmath15 is an orientation preserving homeomorphism of @xmath14 onto itself .",
    "the question is : if the level 0 set @xmath16 is an attractor , what can we say about the boundary of the basin of attraction ? it can be defined as follows .",

    "we continue to investigate @xmath108 and @xmath368 , this time from the point of view of invariant measures .",
    "the relevant invariant measures for @xmath108 and @xmath368 are those that project to @xmath61 and @xmath165 .",
    "there are two trivial ergodic ones : @xmath375 and @xmath376 ( in the one - sided case , @xmath377 and @xmath378 ) .    by theorem  [ onemeasure ] and corollary  [ exmain ] ,",
    "there is at most one nontrivial measure of this type .",
    "such measure for @xmath108 is @xmath124 , which appears in theorem  [ main ]  .",
    "it is clear that the projection from @xmath379 to the first coordinate is an isomorphism of the systems @xmath380 and @xmath381 . in particular",
    ", this shows that @xmath124 is ergodic for @xmath108 .",
    "now we consider @xmath368 . here",
    "the situation is completely different .",
    "denote the lebesgue measure on @xmath14 by @xmath382 .",
    "the following theorem can be interpreted as the lebesgue measure being invariant for our random system of maps .",
    "the proof is straightforward and specific for our family .",
    "[ invmeas ] the measure @xmath383 is invariant for @xmath368 .",
    "let @xmath384 for @xmath385 and let @xmath386 be an @xmath46-cylinder of the one - sided shift and let @xmath387 $ ] or @xmath388 $ ] be a @xmath382-measurable set .",
    "then , @xmath389 where , for @xmath390 , @xmath391 and @xmath392 since @xmath393 we have @xmath394 and clearly @xmath395 therefore , @xmath396    the sets of the form @xmath397 with @xmath398 as above generate the whole @xmath399-field of @xmath400-measurable sets .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "once we know this measure , let us compute the lyapunov exponent in the direction of the fiber . for each @xmath205 ,",
    "the derivative is @xmath201 on an interval of length @xmath401 and @xmath202 on an interval of length @xmath402",
    ". therefore the exponent is @xmath403 we have @xmath404 and @xmath405 .",
    "therefore @xmath406 since @xmath200 , this exponent is negative .",
    "this agrees with theorem  [ forw - contr1 ] .",
    "recall that @xmath164 is the natural projection ( that forgets about @xmath168 with negative @xmath46 ) .",
    "[ image_meas ] we have @xmath407    we have @xmath408 , so @xmath409 is a measure invariant for @xmath368 .",
    "this measure vanishes on the set @xmath410 , so by theorems  [ onemeasure ] and  [ invmeas ] it is equal to @xmath411 .",
    "let us comment on invariant measures for the random systems we are considering .",
    "we assume that @xmath368 is essentially contracting and the base system is bernoulli . by theorem  [ onemeasure ] , there is one nontrivial measure invariant for @xmath368 that projects to @xmath165 . by theorem",
    "[ projection ] , it is of the form @xmath412 for some measure @xmath171 on the interval .",
    "thus , the question about the existence of an absolutely continuous measure for our system is the question whether this specific measure @xmath171 is absolutely continuous .",
    "this is very different from the situation for non - random interval maps , when there is a lot of invariant measures and we are asking only whether there is one among them which is absolutely continuous .",
    "we conjecture that typically ( whatever this means ) the measure @xmath171 is not absolutely continuous .",
    "the systems considered in theorem  [ invmeas ] are very special , and @xmath413 just follows from the definition of the maps .",
    "now we can prove some interesting properties of the function @xmath39 .",
    "[ dense ] for almost every @xmath414 the preimage @xmath415 is dense in @xmath158 . in particular , the graph of @xmath39 is dense in @xmath416 .",
    "choose a cylinder @xmath417 , analogous as in the proof of theorem  [ invmeas ] .",
    "by lemma  [ pastphi ] , on @xmath418 the function @xmath39 takes all values that it takes on the whole space .",
    "however , by proposition  [ image_meas ] and since @xmath124 is concentrated on the graph of @xmath39 , it takes almost all values from @xmath14 . by remark  [ invgr ] , @xmath419 if @xmath420 , then @xmath421 the map @xmath422 is a homeomorphism preserving the lebesgue equivalence class , and therefore @xmath39 takes on @xmath68 almost all values from @xmath14 .",
    "cylinders form a countable basis of the topological space @xmath158 and the intersection of a countable family of sets of full measure has full measure . therefore for almost every @xmath414 the preimage @xmath415 is dense in @xmath158 .",
    "the second statement of the theorem follows immediately from the first one .",
    "by theorem  [ main ]   and corollary  [ exmain ] , the map @xmath108 has a fiberwise attractor which is a graph of a measurable invariant function from the base to the fiber space .",
    "we will show that this is not the case if we consider @xmath368 , even if we skip the assumption of invariance .",
    "assume that such @xmath426 exists .",
    "then the graph of @xmath427 is an attractor for @xmath108 , because @xmath371 depends only on @xmath58 and on @xmath373 with nonnegative @xmath301 . by a theorem from  @xcite , @xmath428 almost everywhere .",
    "thus , the graph of @xmath429 is @xmath108-invariant , and it follows that the graph of @xmath426 is @xmath368-invariant .      in such a way we get an excellent illustration of the _ mystery of the vanishing attractor _",
    ", described in  @xcite . for an invertible system",
    "an attractor exists , but it vanishes when we pass to the noninvertible system .",
    "this happens in spite of the fact that in the definition of an attractor we only look at forward orbits , and that in the base the future is completely independent of the past .",
    "one can try to explain this paradox by saying that for @xmath368 also there is an attractor , but it is the whole space .",
    "this is true , but normally when thinking of an attractor one considers subsets much smaller than the whole space .",
    "another explanation is that when trying to find an attractor for @xmath368 , which is a graph , we try to specify one point in @xmath98 for each @xmath369 , without specifying @xmath58 .",
    "however , when we know the past , we basically know @xmath58 , and with the knowledge of @xmath58 and @xmath369 we know @xmath371 for all @xmath431 .",
    "again , this is a kind of explanation ( due to m.   rams ) , but still the question why in order to have a nice description of the future we need the past , if the past and the future are independent , remains a little mysterious ."
