    "it is widely believed that stars are born with circumstellar disks in molecular cloud cores . according to the observation , class i or class ii protostars",
    "are typically associated by a disk with @xmath11 @xmath12 ( @xcite ) . in the preceding class 0 phase ,",
    "star forming regions are deeply surrounded by an infalling envelope . in order to understand the origin of mass in disk and star ,",
    "an appropriate model for formation and evolution of the disk is desirable .",
    "molecular cloud cores are expected to have an angular momentum , and cores are thought to collapse to form stars .",
    "if a cloud core has a sufficient angular momentum , infalling gas can not be directly accreted by the central star because of centrifugal barrier .",
    "in such a case , disk formation is a natural consequence of the conservation of angular momentum . around a central star , a circumstellar disk and an infalling envelope",
    "are expected . if one assumes the conservation of angular momentum with a typical amount , a small central star and a massive disk are expected as an equilibrium state ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , observations indicate the lower mass disk than above equilibrium state . therefore , some mechanisms are required to decrease the mass of the disk .",
    "efficient transport of angular momentum will drive the mass accretion flow onto the central star to decrease mass of the disk .",
    "this accretion flow is important to determine the disk - to - star mass ratio .",
    "we assume that a single star and a circumstellar disk forms in an isolated environment . in the early phase",
    ", only the central part of the molecular cloud core collapses in runaway fashion to form a seed of adiabatic core ( runaway collapse phase ) . in the later phase",
    ", the envelope falls onto the core and the disk ( accretion phase ) . between above two phases , a seed of circumstellar disk forms and begins to grow .",
    "the mass accretion rate @xmath3 onto the core and the disk can be written in the form of @xmath13 with a coefficient @xmath14 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath14 depends on the detail of the collapse .",
    "for example , @xmath15 corresponds to an isothermal spherically symmetric self - similar solution by larson ( ) . on the other hand , @xmath16 corresponds to another self - similar solution by shu ( ) .",
    "the solution by larson ( ) ( also penston ) is useful to describe a runaway collapse with dynamical inflow outside . on the other hand ,",
    "the solution by shu ( ) describes the inside - out collapse with static gas sphere outside .",
    "rotation of the cloud core is ignored in above two solutions . as a solution of collapse with rotation , an axisymmetric self - similar solution for inviscid isothermal flow is studied by @xcite ( hereafter sh98 ) ( see also narita , hayashi , & miyama ) .",
    "this solution represents both the runaway collapse of rotating cloud core and the inside - out growth of the disk . according to the sh98 solution , in the accretion",
    "phase a centrifugally supported disk grows inside the accretion shock which propagates outwards with time .",
    "mass accretion rate in sh98 corresponds to @xmath17@xmath18 at the shock front .",
    "the precise value of @xmath14 depends on the speed of rotation . in the runaway collapse phase ,",
    "sh98 solution with rotation is similar to larson s solution with different accretion rate .",
    "however , in the accretion phase sh98 solution is qualitatively different from spherically symmetric cases . with rotation , mass accretion onto the center vanishes since infalling envelope stops at the shock front with finite radius . as a result , in the accretion phase , disk with surface density @xmath19 forms inside the shock front .",
    "this surface density distribution is same as equilibrium disks ( c.f .",
    ", @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although above sh98 solution is useful to represent formation and growth of the disk , it is still unrealistic in two points .",
    "first , since above self - similar solution assumes isothermal equation of state , it is not reasonable approximation in the central region where density is sufficiently large and cooling is inefficient . in this paper non - isothermal evolution",
    "is taken into account .",
    "second , in sh98 the effect of angular momentum transport is ignored . turbulent viscosity induced by magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) ( @xcite )",
    "is believed to be important although it is well known that the molecular viscosity is too small in a circumstellar disk .",
    "angular momentum is also possibly transported by the gravitational torque induced by gravitational instability ( gi ) . in this paper , as the simplest treatment for angular momentum transport by mri and gi , simple prescription with @xmath20-viscosity ( @xcite , @xcite ) is adopted .",
    "results of detailed numerical calculations without viscous prescription are sometimes interpreted using viscous parameters . for example , kratter et al .",
    "( ) indicates that the effective parameter @xmath20 can be close to unity in gravitationally unstable disk .",
    "viscous effect are expected to become important especially in the accretion phase even if it is inefficient during the runaway collapse phase ( @xcite ) . in the accretion phase",
    ", effective viscosity will generate considerable accretion flow from a circumstellar disk to the central star , and it will affect the disk - to - star mass ratio .",
    "thus , it is essential to investigate viscous evolution of a disk in the accretion phase .    to consider the growth of the central star and the surrounding disk as a function of time , unsteady treatment is required .",
    "unsteady viscous accretion disk with constant @xmath20 is studied in the view point of isothermal self - similar solution by tsuribe ( ) ( hereafter t99 ) . in t99 solution with the effect of viscosity , different from sh98 ,",
    "the central star grows by mass accretion from the disk .",
    "the radial profile of the surface density in t99 solution is given by @xmath21 in the inner disk and @xmath22 in the outer disk . in the inner disk ,",
    "mass of the disk is small and gravitational force from the central star dominates .",
    "while in the outer disk , considerable disk gravity changes rotation law to the flat rotation ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the effect of non - isothermal temperature distribution considered in this paper modifies the surface density and velocity profiles in the disk .",
    "the profile of the surface density in the disk is important to consider the succeeding planet formation .",
    "kokubo & ida ( ) ( hereafter ki02 ) discussed that the initial profile of dust surface density influences on the timescale of accumulation of planetesimal as well as on the mass of protoplanets .",
    "they argued that the initial profile of the surface density of protoplanetary disk has the critical power index @xmath24 . in the case with @xmath25 , mass of protoplanets increase with radius , while it decreases with radius in the case with @xmath26 .",
    "however , they do not discuss the origin of the surface density profile of disk .",
    "thus , provided that dust to gas ratio is constant , understanding the disk surface density distribution will help understand not only the star formation but also the planet formation .",
    "mass accretion rate onto the disk will decline with time owing to the depletion of the parent cloud core .",
    "previous self - similar solutions did not include this effect . on the other hand , numerical studies by e.g. , rice et al .",

    "time evolution of mass ratio between a central star and a disk with the effect of viscosity is studied numerically by several authors .",
    "@xcite studied time evolution of young circumstellar disk with viscosity by solving the one - dimensional diffusion equation .",
    "they investigated the disk evolution taking into account of the dynamical accretion onto the disk as well as viscous accretion onto the star .",
    "they argue that the disk mass can be determined by the competition between mass accretion rate to the disk and to the central star .",
    "they conclude that the disk mass in the early phase of disk formation tends to be lower than the mass of the star as long as viscous parameter is moderately large ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "however , they considered only the case with the mass accretion rate onto the disk @xmath16 given by shu ( ) .",
    "their conclusion seems to depend on this choice of accretion rate .",
    "the disk - to - star mass ratio is expected to be different in the case with different accretion rate from the infalling envelope .",
    "hueso & guillot ( ) ( hereafter hg05 ) studied the time evolution of the surface density profiles using viscous disk model in order to find compatible set of parameters for the observed t - tauri stars .",
    "visser et al .",
    "( ) used one - dimensional viscous evolution model of the disk in order to analyze the chemical processes during the collapse of a molecular cloud core .",
    "although time evolution of mass in the star and the disk are also presented in these two studies , they assume @xmath16 as the mass accretion rate onto the disk .",
    "thus , the model with the different @xmath14 from shu s self - similar solution is needed to be studied .    in this paper , in order to study the disk - to - star mass ratio and the origin of the surface density distribution , we investigate the time - dependent evolution of protostellar disks subject to high mass loading from the dynamically collapsing envelope .",

    "mass growth of both the disk and the star is calculated with these two processes . especially , the difference between the mass accretion rate onto the disk and onto the star is taken into account .",

    "although we assume that the mass accretion rate onto the shock front is given by @xmath46 as in sh98 , on longer timescales , the mass accretion rate @xmath47 onto the disk is expected to decline with time owing to the depletion of the parent cloud core , different from the self - similar solution .",
