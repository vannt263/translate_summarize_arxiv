    "the conjectured constant above is known to be attained by the figure eight knot complement which admits a unique @xmath27-fibration .",
    "the first application of theorem [ thm : main ] , is an amelioration of the lower bound , @xmath28 for the entropy of pseudo - anosovs on a surface due to penner@xcite , provided that there is at least one puncture .",

    "in fact , one can construct such examples so that the mapping tori @xmath47 converge to a cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold ( though this limit may not be a surface bundle ) .",

    "the projective structure on @xmath4 is given by an atlas such that each transition map is the restriction of some element in @xmath82 .",

    "this definition implies many consequences .",

    "it is easy to see that if we start with a strongly convex submanifold bounded by @xmath129 for some @xmath130 , then the limiting metric is @xmath131 .",

    "it remains to prove corollary [ cor : wp ] so consider the @xmath251 inner product on @xmath252 defined by @xmath253 and recall that the weil - petersson metric @xmath254 on the teichmller space @xmath61 is a riemannian part of the dual hermitian metric to the above co - metric on the cotangent space . then , weil - peterson translation distance is defined by @xmath255    if one starts the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] for compact surfaces with theorem 1.2 in @xcite which asserts @xmath256 instead of proposition [ prop : rvol vs d_t ] , and applies @xmath257 where @xmath258 is the @xmath251 norm induced by @xmath259 , we obtain the desired estimate .",
    "if we prove _ corollary [ cor : wp ] _ first , then _ theorem [ thm : main ] _ for the compact case follows immediately by the cauchy - schwarz inequality , @xmath260",

    "thus the boundary components of the convex core are  modelled \" on the surfaces at infinity in that they have  roughly the same geometry \" .",
    "ideally one would like to extend this equivalence allowing us to think of the convex hull @xmath262 as being",
    " modelled \" on a 3-manifold , which we denote by @xmath264 , that is none other than the portion of the universal curve above the axis of @xmath8 between the points @xmath269 and @xmath270 .",

    "all the manifolds that we consider have _ uniformly bounded geometry_. that is , the injectivity radius of the sequence @xmath277 is bounded from below by a constant @xmath278 . under this hypothesis , a version of the morse lemma says that a closed curve @xmath279 of length @xmath280 is contained in an @xmath49-regular neighborhood of the closed geodesic in its homotopy class where @xmath281 .",
    "2 .   let @xmath282 be a ( short , simple ) closed curve on @xmath83 and we denote the geodesic representative of @xmath283 in @xmath262 by @xmath284 .",
    "then the lengths of the geodesics @xmath285 for @xmath286 are uniformly bounded .",
    "3 .   if @xmath287 , then the distance between geodesics @xmath288 and @xmath289 in @xmath262 is _ roughly _ @xmath290 .",
    "more precisely there are constants @xmath291 such that @xmath292 to see this we identify the curve @xmath293 with the obvious curve in the fibre @xmath294 to obtain a family of curves in the model manifold @xmath264 all of which have the same length @xmath295 say .",
    "the distance between @xmath296 and @xmath297 in the metric on the model is _ exactly _ @xmath298 .",
    "push forward using the @xmath299-bilipschitz homeomorphism that minsky constructs ( hence the factors @xmath300 ) to obtain a pair of curves homotopic to the geodesics @xmath301 and @xmath302 respectively .",
    "observe that the lengths of these curves are bounded by @xmath303 so that they are at bounded distance from the closed geodesics by the morse lemma ( hence the terms @xmath304 ) .",
    "an important notion , due to mcmullen , is that of _ depth _ in the convex core which , for a set of points , is defined to be the minimum distance to the boundary of the convex core .",
    "the inequality ( [ linear growth ] ) can be used to prove an estimate for the depth of the geodesic @xmath285 :      brock - bromberg @xcite give a proof of an analogous inequality without the hypothesis of bounded geometry . as we will use ( [ depth growth ] ) in an essential way in the proof of theorem [ thm : brock ] , we give a short proof .      the geodesic @xmath309 in @xmath277 represents the curve @xmath310 on the surface at infinity @xmath311 .",
    "the length of @xmath310 on @xmath311 is equal to the length of @xmath282 on @xmath83 and so is less than @xmath295 . by epstein - marden - markovic and bridgeman the nearest point retraction to @xmath312",
    "is @xmath313-bilipschitz and applying this to @xmath282 we obtain @xmath314 of length at most @xmath315 .",
    "now , since the injectivity radius is bounded below by @xmath316 , the morse lemma tells us that @xmath317 stays within an @xmath49-regular neighborhood of the closed geodesic in its homotopy class namely @xmath309 so that , @xmath318 to prove the lower bound one chooses a piecewise geodesic path joining @xmath309 to @xmath319 and passing via @xmath320 .",
    "the length of this path gives an upper bound for @xmath321 @xmath322 so that @xmath323 using ( [ linear growth ] ) and the fact that @xmath83 and @xmath312 are 5-bilipschitz .",
    "thus the distance from @xmath319 to @xmath312 is roughly @xmath324 . replacing @xmath309 by @xmath325 and applying the same reasoning ,",
    "one obtains an analogous lower bound for the distance from @xmath319 to @xmath326 in terms of @xmath327 . combining the two bounds yields the required lower bound for the depth of @xmath328 in terms of @xmath329 .",
    "our strategy is , following mcmullen and brock - bromberg , to decompose the convex core into a _ deep part _ and a _",
    "shallow part_. we first show that the shallow part is  negligible \" then , by geometric inflexibility , we see that the deep part is  almost isometric \" to a large chunk of the infinite cyclic cover @xmath331 which we can explicitly describe .",
    "consequently the volume of the deep part grows like @xmath332 .",
    "recall that the existence of minsky s model ( see preceding paragraph ) for the convex core of @xmath263 guarantees a universal lower bound for injectivity radii of the family @xmath333 .",

    "@xmath335-deep part of @xmath277 _ to be , @xmath336 note that this is a proper subset of the convex core @xmath337 .",
    "moreover , it follows from ( [ depth growth ] ) that , for fixed @xmath335 and @xmath210 sufficiently large , @xmath338 is non empty and that its width grows linearly in @xmath210 ( by _ width _ we mean that the minimum distance connected components of @xmath339 )",
    ". finally , we define the _ shallow part of @xmath262 _ to be the complement of the deep part , that is , @xmath340 .",
    "let @xmath207 be a point on the axis of @xmath8 .",
    "a slight modification of the proof of theorem 8.3 of brock and bromberg @xcite yields : given @xmath335 sufficiently large , there are constants @xmath341 such that for all @xmath342 there is a diffeomorphism @xmath343 with bilipschitz distortion at a point @xmath344 less than @xmath345 and where the constants @xmath346 depend on @xmath316 , that is the lower bound on the injectivity radii of the @xmath277 , and @xmath347 .",
    "we have given a simplified statement of a more general result they obtain because we are working in a geometrically bounded context . in order to prove ( [ eq : vol n vs vol c ] ) we must obtain a description of @xmath348 and , in particular , estimate the number of translates of a well - chosen fundamental domain that are contained in @xmath349 .",

    "choose a homotopy class @xmath282 of a simple closed curve on @xmath83 , and denote the geodesic representative of @xmath353 in @xmath262 by @xmath284 .",
    "in particular , there is a collection of @xmath354 closed geodesics in @xmath262 , @xmath355 by minsky @xcite the lengths of the geodesics in @xmath356 are uniformly bounded ( i.e. not depending on @xmath210 ) from above by some @xmath357 .    consider the subset of geodesics belonging to @xmath356 that are not contained in the deep part @xmath358 , or equivalently , the values of @xmath359 such that @xmath360 . by ( [ depth growth ] )",
    "one has the inequality @xmath361 for @xmath305 and @xmath362 which do not depend on @xmath210 .",
