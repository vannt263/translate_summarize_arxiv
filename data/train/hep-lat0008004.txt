    "mills theory is the wilson loop or holonomy ; it is defined as a path - ordered exponent ,    w_r= ida_^at^a , [ wl1]where @xmath3 with @xmath4 parametrizes the closed contour , @xmath5 is the yang  mills field ( or connection ) and @xmath6 are the generators of the gauge group in a given representation @xmath7 whose dimension is @xmath8 .",
    "it is generally believed that in three and four dimensions the average of the wilson loop in a pure yang ",
    "mills quantum theory exhibits an area behavior for large and simple contours ( like flat rectangular ) .",
    "this should be true not for all representations but those with ` @xmath9-ality ' nonequal zero ; in the simplest case of the @xmath10 gauge group these are representations with half - integer spin @xmath11 .",
    "one of the difficulties in proving the asymptotic area law for the wilson loop in half - integer representations ( and proving that in integer representations it is absent ) is that the wilson loop is a complicated object by itself : it is impossible to calculate it analytically in a general non - abelian background field . meanwhile , it is sometimes easier to average a quantity over an ensemble than to calculate it for a specific representative .",
    "however , in case of the wilson loop the path - ordering is a serious obstacle on that way .",
    "a decade ago we have suggested a formula for the wilson loop in a given background belonging to any gauge group and any representation @xcite . in this formula",
    "the path ordering along the loop is removed , but at the price of an additional functional integration over all gauge transformations of the given non - abelian background field .",
    "this formula is discussed below , in section 2 .",
    "furthermore , the wilson loop can be presented in a form of a surface integral @xcite , see section 3 .",
    "we call this representation the non - abelian stokes theorem .",
    "it is quite different from previous interesting statements @xcite also called by their authors ` non - abelian stokes theorems ' but which involve surface ordering .",
    "our formula has no surface ordering .",
    "a classification of ` non - abelian stokes theorems ' for arbitrary groups and their representations has been given recently by kondo et al .",
    "@xcite who used the naturally arising techniques of flag manifolds .",
    "though these formulae usually do not facilitate finding wilson loops in particular backgrounds , they can be used to average over ensembles of yang  mills configurations , and in more general settings , see e.g. @xcite .    our formula for the wilson loop have been recently questioned by faber , ivanov , troitskaya and zach ( fitz ) @xcite . in section 4",
    "we show that all points of their criticism are due to mistakes in mathematics , which we thoroughly locate , one by one .",
    "an alternative formula for the wilson loop proposed by fitz is also mathematically inconsistent , and we pinpoint their concrete errors .    finally , in section 5 we present a variant of our formula for the wilson loop in lattice regularization .",

    "therefore , a certain regularization is understood in these equations , ensuring that @xmath19 is sufficiently smooth .",

    "another discretization but leading to the same result has been used recently by kondo @xcite .",
