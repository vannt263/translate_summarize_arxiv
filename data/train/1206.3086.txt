    "the study of strong interaction physics under extreme conditions is a central topic of nuclear physics with a large number of experimental and theoretical programs focusing on the area .",
    "these conditions comprise large temperatures , densities , as well as extreme values of nuclear isospin . in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions a very hot fireball",
    "is created in the collision zone and , at high temperatures , hadronic matter is assumed to melt into its constituents , quarks and gluons .",
    "the net baryon density in such reactions is determined by the beam energy . at the planned energies in the upcoming fair ( facility for antiproton and ion research ) at gsi , a hot and relatively dense system will be produced .",
    "a central point of these investigations is the understanding of the quark - hadron phase transition .",
    "however , while relatively high densities and finite temperatures might be reached in laboratory experiments , the study of neutron stars is essential if one wants to probe the low temperature and high density region of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter .",
    "observations of neutron star masses ( and possibly radii ) provide the standard way of constraining the inner composition of these objects . more precisely , recent observations have set new high mass constraints for neutron stars ( psr j1614 - 2230 @xcite being the most important ) , and equations of state aimed to describe compact stars are thus expected to provide objects with high masses @xcite . in the case of hybrid stars ( neutron stars with a quark core in its center ) , a quark phase based on a simple non - interacting quark model like the mit bag model tends to reduce the maximum mass significantly ( see the discussion in @xcite ) . a quark phase that includes strong repulsive interactions ,",
    "however , may have an equation of state quite similar to a purely hadronic one .",
    "this prevents the softening of the matter and the drop in maximum mass @xcite .",
    "it has been found , however , that models with a strong repulsive quark - quark interaction make the description of lattice results at @xmath0 nearly impossible @xcite , since including a repulsive mean field interaction strongly decreases the quark number susceptibility .",
    "therefore , most current successful hybrid star models would fail in this regard , if they were to be applied to the high - temperature , low - density regime .    at high temperatures",
    ", qcd exhibits a crossover to a deconfined phase and the quarks and gluons become the dominant degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the temperature at which this transition takes place is estimated to be @xmath1 mev @xcite .",
    "a phase transition is also expected to take place at high densities , where baryons start to overlap , and quarks and gluons become the effective degrees of freedom .",
    "this indicates that at some point a hadronic model will not be able to appropriately describe the matter present inside a neutron star , and a deconfinement mechanism needs to be introduced .    in the following",
    ", we will discuss a theoretical approach that is able to describe the conditions found in compact stars as well as those created in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the aim of this approach is to find a unified description for the thermodynamic properties of qcd which can be applied to compact stars and heavy ion collisions at different beam energies while being in accordance with lattice qcd results at vanishing baryon density .",
    "an approach of this type is essential if one wants to investigate a phase diagram that has a region of a cross - over transition to quark matter ( as it is clearly established by lattice qcd calculations ) and a first - order transition at high densities and low temperatures .",
    "this is not possible by combining separate models for the hadronic and quark phase .",
    "such a first - order transition at low temperature has also been observed in recent lattice monte - carlo calculations of an effective qcd lagrangian @xcite .",
    "in addition , a model that can cover the physics at high temperature as well as at high density can serve as an important tool for the increasingly important studies of black hole formation and black - hole neutron - star mergers , where temperatures up to 90 mev and high densities might be reached @xcite .    in a previous paper , an extended quark @xmath2 parity doublet model was introduced for this purpouse @xcite . in the parity model @xcite ,",
    "the mass splitting between the nucleons and the respective chiral partners is generated by the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and their coupling to the corresponding order parameter , the scalar ( sigma ) field .",
    "the same applies for the baryon octet in the @xmath2 case @xcite .",
    "when chiral symmetry is restored and the sigma field vanishes , the chiral partner masses become degenerate . a good description of nuclear saturation properties , as well as neutron star observables",
    "can easily be achieved within this formalism @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite a phase diagram for chiral symmetry restoration was calculated using an @xmath3 version of the parity model .",
    "in addition , the parity model has been shown to describe the lattice results at @xmath4 and can be used in dynamical models for relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "we will apply this model to the study of neutron stars .",
    "a complete phase diagram for iso - spin symmetric matter , using the extended version of the @xmath5 parity model , which contains quark degrees of freedom , has been calculated in @xcite .",
    "as expected , at low temperatures the nuclear matter liquid - gas phase transition and the chiral symmetry restoration are of first order . within this approach the deconfinement phase transition , on the other hand ,",
    "is a crossover .",
    "furthermore , chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement do not coincide , and at intermediate densities the matter is chirally symmetric but still confined .",
    "whether such a chirally symmetric hadronic phase can be the @xmath6 equivalent of the @xmath7 quarkyonic phase @xcite is still subject to debate @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the properties of electrically - neutral chemically - equilibrated matter in the framework of the model described above .",

    "we choose the vacuum mass of the chiral parter for the nucleons to be @xmath42 mev , the lighter resonance with spin @xmath43 and negative parity .",
    "lower values for this mass ( @xmath44 mev for instance ) would lead to chiral restoration taking place at lower densities @xcite , and to less massive stars @xcite .",
    "in addition , using a formula for the width as a function of the bare mass parameter @xmath16 @xcite , one finds that the width of the less massive resonance would be too small to have escaped experimental detection @xcite .",
    "other candidates like the @xmath45 mev also have been suggested @xcite . for the hyperons , we simply chose the splitting between the particles and the respective parity partners to have the same value as for the nucleons , thus keeping the number of parameters to a minimum .",

    "the chemical potentials of the hadrons are decreased by the quarks , but not vice - versa . in other words , as the quarks start appearing , they effectively suppress the hadrons by changing their chemical potential , while the quarks are only affected through the volume correction factor @xmath74 .",
    "a shortcoming of the parametrization above is that the compressibility of bulk matter at saturation density is too high ( @xmath77 mev ) and the equations of state is a bit too stiff a low densities when compared with heavy ion collision data from ref .",

    "we clearly see that the price paid to obtain a realistic compressibility is the reduction of the maximum mass of the neutron star .",
    "this effect is generally model independent , but is known to be more pronounced in the parity model .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that we have not included in the present calculation any rotational or strong magnetic field effects in order to keep the effect of the appearance of the parity partners more clear .",
    "both rotation and strong magnetic fields are known to increase the maximum mass of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "but for model b.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in principle , the correct quantity to be used in order to analyze proto - neutron star temporal evolution is the entropy per baryon , instead of the temperature . besides",
    ", trapped neutrinos should be included in earlier stages of star evolution , when the temperature ( or entropy per baryon ) is higher .",
    "although these features are of great interest , our goal in this preliminary study of the topic is to analyze the application of the model to neutron stars in the simplest case of @xmath109 and the second simplest case of @xmath110 mev .",
    "nevertheless , we chose 30 mev for the finite temperature case because it is approximately the maximum temperature reproduced in the center of neutron stars when the entropy per baryon is fixed to @xmath111 . in this way",
    ", we study the two limiting cases of the star evolution ( @xmath109 and @xmath110 mev ) .",

    "[ popcold ] and [ popcold2 ] .",
    "we see that at low densities both stars consist only of neutrons , protons , electrons and muons . towards the center of the stars the quarks appear ( first the @xmath117 , followed by the @xmath118 ) followed by the chiral partners ( of neutrons and protons ) .",
    "the threshold for the quarks to appear is @xmath119 @xmath120 and @xmath121 @xmath120 for parametrizations a and b , respectively .",
    "it is interesting to notice that in this model the baryons appear in small quantities but do not vanish at high densities .",
    "this is a consequence of the suppression of the hadrons due to the excluded volume prescription .",
    "the hadrons are suppressed exponentially by the quark pressure though not removed entirely .",
    "note , however , that their fraction becomes so small that their contribution to the thermodynamics of the system is negligible .",
    "furthermore , at high densities , the amount of nucleons and the respective chiral partners is very similar .",
    "particles that contain strangeness , despite being included in the model , do not appear or appear in very small quantities in the cold stars .",
    "this is due their large bare masses and the slow restoration of the strange scalar ( @xmath27 ) field to its zero value at high densities .",
    "the decrease in central density stated above is not enough to prevent strange particles to appear in the core of warm stars ( figs .",
    "[ popwarm ] and [ popwarm2 ] ) . at low densities",
    "we see @xmath122s , @xmath123s , @xmath124s and @xmath125s and at high densities @xmath126s , all with their respective chiral partners .",
    "the strange quarks only appear at densities beyond the ones present in the studied stars .",
    "overall , the amount of particles that contain strangeness is not high enough to significantly change star properties such as mass and radius .",
    "these properties are influenced mainly by the pressure and energy density changing substantially due to the high temperature , and the polyakov potential u , which only affects the system at finite temperature .",

    "their appearance is related to the relation between their effective masses and their effective chemical potentials . at zero temperature , for example",
    ", a particle only appears when its effective chemical potential is larger than its effective mass .",
    "for finite temperature , thermal effects also contribute making the above requirement more relaxed .",
    "but more importantly , the order of the particles in a star is strongly constrained by charged neutrality .",
    "this makes the appearance of negative charged hyperons more favorable , followed by charge neutral ones .",
    "therefore , the only particles that appear in significant quantities for parametrization b at @xmath110 mev are the @xmath123 followed by the @xmath124 and respective chiral partners and they are the ones that still appear at @xmath109 . for parametrization",
    "a , because there are no significant quantity of hyperons at @xmath110 mev , there are also no hyperons in the @xmath109 mev case .",
    "for the cold case , there are basically two first order phase transitions in the star , when the down quarks appear and when the up quarks and chiral partners appear . for the warm case , both of these transitions are smoother and closer to each other . for the symmetric case , relevant for heavy ion collisions , the phase transitions would be stronger for any temperature , since chemical equilibrium and charge neutrality push the chiral symmetry restoration ( related to the appearance of chiral partners ) to lower densities with respect to the symmetric matter case and renders the transition smoother @xcite .",
    "the thermal evolution of the stars was obtained by solving the full set of equations that govern energy balance and transport in a relativistic star @xcite .",

    "the pairing patterns considered were the neutron singlet ( @xmath128 ) and triplet ( @xmath129 ) states , as described in @xcite .",
    "we point out that it is possible that protons form a singlet superconductor @xcite , however , the pairing of protons in the core is still not very well understood ( see @xcite and references therein ) . for that reason we consider only neutron superfluidity at this stage .",

    "we also plot a set of prominent observed cooling data , where circles denote objects whose age was determined through spin - down , squares through the object motion with respect to originating supernova ( kinematic age ) @xcite and diamonds show the evolution of cas a @xcite .",
    "we note that although our model exhibits temperatures and ages comparable with those of cas a , it does not agree with the fast cooling exhibited by this object in the last 10 years .",
    "we point out , however , that differently than in references @xcite we have not removed fast neutrino emission processes by assuming that protons are in a superconducting state in the entire core .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , such stringent condition is more easily achieved for low densities stars ( less massive ) , since theoretical models show that proton superconductivity does not extend to very high densities . under these conditions (",
    "no fast neutrino processes , and for the critical temperature found in @xcite ) our model might as well reproduce the observed behavior of cas a.    the results shown in fig .",
    "[ cool_delta_0 ] clearly illustrate the effects of quark matter and the chiral partners on the cooling of the star , which we discuss now . the low density of the m / m@xmath92 = 1.0 star forbids the presence of chiral partners .",
    "consequently the cooling of this object is qualitatively the same as that of standard hybrid stars @xcite . on the other hand , for stars with higher central densities , and",
    "thus higher masses , we have chiral partner states being populated , and the cooling of the star is substantially modified .",
    "note that these stars are warmer than their low - mass counterparts .",
    "such behavior is the opposite of that of ordinary neutron stars , which tend to exhibit a faster cooling for heavier objects . in the case of ordinary stars",
    "the acceleration of the cooling with the increase of density is connected to the increasing proton fraction . a higher proton fraction throughout the star means a larger region where the du process is present , and thus a faster cooling . in our model , however , as the density increases ( equivalent to smaller radius in fig .  [ popcold ] ) the proton fraction decreases due to the increase of the chiral partners population . because of this , in our model , higher mass stars present a slower cooling .",
    "we also note that the cooling of stars in model a and b are qualitatively equal , with the difference that model b can not reproduce stars with masses higher than 1.64 m@xmath92 ( fig .",
    "[ cool_delta_0_2 ] ) .",
    "such an effect of slower cooling with increased mass has also been observed in hybrid stars with a color - superconducting quark core @xcite .",
    "we should note here that these results should be considered with care .",
    "the reason is that so far we have not considered neutrino processes involving the chiral partners , which could certainly affect the cooling .",
    "the cross section of the processes involving the chiral partners have not been determined so far , and are therefore excluded from this preliminary study .",
    "if one shows that those cross sections are much smaller than the ones of the traditional particles , i.e. the neutrino luminosity of this process is substantially smaller than that of the traditional du process ; then the results shown here would hold .",
    "these results can as well be easily tested , as soon as there is enough statistical data on the relation between pulsar age , surface temperature and mass .",
    "the results of fig .",
    "[ cool_delta_0 ] and [ cool_delta_0_2 ] show that the cooling of hybrid stars in our model is considerably slower than that of traditional stars , even the one of the m / m@xmath92 = 1.0 star that does not contain chiral partners .",
    "additionally , as we have already mentioned , we observe that during the neutrino dominated era ( ages @xmath131 years in ordinary objects ) more massive stars exhibit a higher temperature .",
    "this substantially delays the photon cooling era , that can be identified by the bending of the cooling tracks at later times .",
    "we see that our model , with the limitations discussed above , agrees fairly well with the cooling data of the colder , and older objects , but fails to describe the temperature of the very young and hot neutron stars .     but for quark matter paired with @xmath132 mev.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    another possibility to be considered is quark pairing .",

    "this is due to the early appearance of the down quark , that compensates the positive charge of the proton .",
    "such a partial appearance of the quarks was already suggested in @xcite .",
    "the up quark appearance happens , for both cold and warm stars , approximately in the same region as the chiral partners ( signaling the chiral symmetry restoration ) .",
    "the zero temperature calculation using the same parametrization for the model as the one calibrated for low and zero chemical potential ( model a ) yields stars with masses in agreement with the most massive observed pulsar ( 1.97  @xmath91 0.04m@xmath92 @xcite ) .",
    "this parametrization , however , leads to nuclear matter with high compressibility .",
    "on the other hand , parametrizations leading to more realistic compressibility values ( like model b ) yield less massive stars . as already shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , corrections that account for the baryonic dirac sea effect such as the relativistic hartree approximation ( rha ) can improve this situation .",
    "we note that the reason we did not consider any extra features that could possible improve the situation in this work is because we wanted to study in detail the population distribution in the star taking into account the relation between baryon chiral partners and quarks at high densities , since this had never been performed before .",
    "work along this line is in progress .",
    "the inclusion of finite temperature in the calculation allows more massive stars in both of the cases studied , but still does not qualitatively change the situation presented above .",
    "we have performed cooling simulations for neutron stars whose microscopic composition is given by our ( cold ) model .",
    "we have found that the presence of the chiral partners affects the thermal evolution , effectively suppressing the hadronic direct urca process .",
    "this , in contrast to other models , yields warmer stars during the neutrino cooling era , and delays the onset of the photon cooling era .",
    "although we can not effectively test such a prediction at the moment , we will be able to do so , hopefully , in the near future .",
    "we also considered the possibility of pairing in the quark phase , where a cfl - like pairing was assumed .",
    "the suppression of the quark neutrino emission processes , brought on by pairing , reduces the total emission of neutrinos further , leading to even warmer stars in the neutrino cooling era .",
    "we stress that the cooling results presented here should be considered as a first approximation only , since there are many factors that still need to be considered , like the neutrino emissions from the chiral partners , and the effects of stronger quark pairing on the eos , which warrants future work along those lines .",
    "we believe , however , that the cooling investigation put forth in this paper might be a good , qualitative study of the cooling of neutron stars within a @xmath2 doublet parity model composition , given that the available cooling data can be reproduced .",
    "furthermore , a recent work @xcite has shown that rotation might have an important effect on the cooling of compact stars , thus we intend to perform 2d simulations of the thermal evolution of stars described by our model .",
    "this work has been supported by gsi and the hessian initiative for excellence ( loewe ) through the helmholtz international center for fair ( hic for fair ) .",
