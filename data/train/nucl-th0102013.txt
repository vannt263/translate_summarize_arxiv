    "electromagnetic processes constitute a basic tool to investigate the baryon structure since the photon couples to the spin and flavor of the constituent quarks , revealing their spin - flavor correlations inside the baryons .",
    "this explains the current experimental effort along this line ( mami , elsa , graal ) with specific experimental programs in tjnaf @xcite .    from a theoretical point of view , most analyses rely on the use of the non - relativistic quark model @xcite in spite of the fact that for the low - lying non - strange resonances the velocity of the quarks inside the baryons may be close to @xmath12 .",
    "incorporation of two  body exchange currents does not mean much improvement on the results @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , attempts to use relativized quark models combined with consistent transition operators have been carried out @xcite and light - front and point  form studies have also been done @xcite partially solving some of the failures of the non - relativistic approach . however",
    ", a complete understanding of the relevant ingredients in the description of electromagnetic processes has not been reached yet .",
    "our aim in this article is to investigate the role played by some relativistic corrections to the electromagnetic transition operators , specifically those ones related to the coupling of the photon to @xmath2 components of the baryon ( mesonic cloud ) , also underlying the well known vector  meson dominance phenomenology .",
    "the need for the _ explicit _ contribution of the cloud to describe electromagnetic interactions of baryons was also concluded in @xcite , where it was shown on very general grounds that meson exchange in the @xmath13 potential can not play the role of the @xmath14 configurations in the baryon .",
    "the importance of the explicit consideration of the meson cloud for electromagnetic processes has been recently studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a main motivation for this study comes from the analysis of strong pionic decay processes where the implementation of the coupling of the pion to @xmath2 baryon components through a @xmath3 operator allows a reasonable description of the decay widths @xcite . in comparison to the elementary emission model ,",
    "the improvement is especially spectacular for the roper resonance since the decay width for the @xmath15 channel has changed from a few mev to few hundreds mev . however , as shown in @xcite , the precise value is open to discussion .    by proceeding in the same way for the electromagnetic transition operator a first simplified model for the photo and electroproduction amplitudes of @xmath16",
    "was presented in @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that the explicit contribution of the baryon mesonic cloud ( taken implicitly into account in the baryon spectrum through the effective parameters and/or interactions of the potential ) is an essential ingredient for the description of transition processes from a non - relativistic quark model scheme .    here",
    "we apply the same ideas to construct a more complete and consistent model to deal with electromagnetic processes that we shall test by evaluating the nucleon form factors .",
    "we put the emphasis in the construction of an effective transition operator to be sandwiched between effective quark ",
    "core wave functions as the ones provided by spectroscopic models .",
    "in particular we shall center in a model previously used to fit the baryon and meson spectrum @xcite and to predict strong pionic decay widths @xcite , though our treatment can be applied to _ any other _",
    " core model of the baryon structure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the direct quark ",
    "photon coupling through the elementary emission model that we shall apply to the calculation of nucleon form factors . in section 3",
    "we study dynamical relativistic corrections induced by @xmath2 pairs in the baryonic medium .",
    "a @xmath3 model will be used in order to implement the relevant @xmath17 baryon components . from the consideration of resonant and non - resonant diagrams",
    "we are driven in section 4 to develop a gauge invariant model .",
    "results are presented and discussed in section 5 .",
    "in the eem the baryon transition process @xmath18 is described by assuming that the photon is emitted by a constituent quark of the baryon ( fig .",
    "the relevant matrix element between quark states is written as :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the quark charge , @xmath21 is the state of polarization of the photon , @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) its energy ( three - momentum ) and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) is the three - momentum of the initial ( final ) quark . by considering the usual electromagnetic current for point  like fermions the single ",

    "the conventional way to derive a non - relativistic transition operator is to proceed to a @xmath33 expansion keeping terms up to the first order @xcite . nevertheless for light baryons in a quark model",
    "this procedure is under suspicion since the quarks move inside the core with relativistic velocities and then @xmath34 can be even bigger than 1",
    ". on the other hand a more reasonable expansion in terms of the relativistic velocity @xmath35 may be slowly convergent since the value of @xmath36 is usually pretty close to 1 .",
    "thus it seems more appropriate to consider the whole relativistic operator eq .",

    "this is a direct consequence of the reduced size of the nucleon wave function which seems to be an inevitable feature of any @xmath1 model able to reasonably fit the spectrum .",
    "concerning the magnetic form factor , the magnetic moments calculated with ( [ oqqeemfull ] ) are a 30 % smaller than the ones obtained with the @xmath33 expansion .",
    "the reason for this reduction is the presence , for @xmath64 , of the energy factor @xmath65 in the vector part of the quark current instead of the mass factor @xmath66 . on the other hand",
    "the @xmath4 dependence of this factor makes the magnetic form factor go faster to zero when increasing @xmath4 as compared to the @xmath33 case .",

    "we certainly expect these corrections , that to some extent represent the effects of the mesonic cloud of the nucleon , to give sizeable contributions to the radius and to the magnetic moments as suggested by other approaches such as the relativistic chiral bag model .    following the ideas developed in a previous paper @xcite to treat strong pionic decays of baryons",

    "quark transition operator for the non - resonant propagation of the quark - antiquark pair .",
    "however , a difficulty immediately arises since this operator , by its own , does not give rise to a conserved current . in order to see how gauge invariance can be recovered it is necessary to understand the underlying physics in the @xmath3 operator .",
    "let us assume that the @xmath3 operator is generated by some residual interaction between quarks and gluons inside the baryon .",
    "this residual interaction may be very complex and its detailed description would tantamount to unveil the structure of the hadronic vacuum .",
    "nonetheless , we shall show in a simplified model that the generation of the pair from the vacuum ( i.e. the use of the @xmath3 operator ) must be accompanied by a mass renormalization .",
    "this mass renormalization directly connected to the strength @xmath72 allows one to restore gauge invariance .",
    "the simplest modelization one can do of the residual interaction is through the coupling of the quarks to a scalar mean field @xmath90 :    @xmath91    where @xmath92 is some unknown coupling constant .",
    "four types of diagrams come from eq .",
    "( [ lresidual ] ) .",
    "two of them correspond to the @xmath3 @xmath93 creation and annihilation under the identification @xmath94 .",
    "the other two diagrams give rise to a mass renormalization for quark and antiquark which can be written as @xmath95 . in general",
    "the renormalized mass @xmath32 may be a very complicated function of @xmath96 and @xmath92 , but since we are interested in transition operators up to order @xmath72 , it can be reduced to the linear relationship quoted above .",
    "the important fact is that the use of the @xmath3 model leads consistently to a mass renormalization .",
    "now we are in conditions to understand how gauge invariance can be recovered .",
    "the renormalization of the mass breaks the conservation of the current associated to the eem . indeed , the mass that appears in eq .",
    "( [ oqqeemfull ] ) has to be interpreted as a bare mass @xmath96 and as a consequence the current associated to the eem is not conserved anymore .",
    "the breaking term is of the order @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the energy corresponding to the unrenormalized mass .",
    "however , the operators have to be written eventually in terms of the physical mass @xmath32 and therefore one has to replace @xmath96 by their value in terms of the physical mass .",
    "when doing so , the terms that break gauge invariance in the eem current and in the non - resonant sector cancel each other under the requirement :    @xmath99    the resulting final single  quark transition operator , which respects gauge invariance , is written as a sum of three terms :    @xmath100    where @xmath26 and @xmath101 are given by eqs .

    "the nucleon form factors obtained from our final gauge invariant operator are shown in fig . 2 ( solid lines ) .",
    "the value of the only free parameter @xmath72 has been chosen so that the magnetic moment of the proton is fitted to its experimental value .",
    "the neutron magnetic moment is also well reproduced , @xmath103 .    as a general result we can say that in all cases the model represents an important improvement with respect to the eem predictions ( dashed lines ) .",
    "a comparison between the two sets of curves gives a quantitative idea of the contribution of the @xmath0 components to the electromagnetic structure of the nucleon .",
    "the magnetic form factors are precisely reproduced up to @xmath104 gev@xmath75 ( notice the @xmath105 in the scale ) .",
    "the main ( positive ) contributions comes from the eem , which gives up to 60 % at @xmath106 ( see fig .",
    "the non - resonant contribution ( nr - eem ) is also positive and it is very relevant at low @xmath4 .",
    "in particular it gives almost a 40 % of the magnetic moment of the proton @xmath107 .",
    "finally , the resonant operator contribution is negative and vanishes at @xmath106 , i.e. it gives no contribution to the magnetic moments .",
    "as expected on general grounds , the contribution of these mesonic components is important only around the mass pole , though its absolute value in this model is still small as compared to the non - resonant propagation .    concerning the electric form factor ,",
    "results differ from data and follow the same trend in the whole range of @xmath4 examined .",
    "the predicted charge square mean radii ( @xmath108 @xmath62 and @xmath109 @xmath62 ) are still small as compared to data ( @xmath110 @xmath62 @xcite and @xmath111 @xmath62 @xcite ) .",
    "it is remarkable that the resonant diagram accounts for 30 % of @xmath112 whereas the eem diagram , that includes darwin - foldy terms and other higher corrections gives @xmath113 @xmath62 . the lack of some contributions to the square mean radius is manifest through the slope of the curves at @xmath4 which determines the difference with data at higher @xmath4 . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ oqqnonres ] ) , the non - resonant term does not take part in the electric transitions since their time  like component vanishes .",
    "regarding the small value of the neutron charge radius , it should be realized that in our case we have used su(6 ) relations ( @xmath114 , @xmath115 ) so that the diagonal contributions of the su(6 ) symmetric component of the wave function ( 98.5 % ) vanishes .",
    "the breaking of the former relations ( coupling to @xmath116 in one case , to @xmath117 in the other for instance ) could significantly change the charge radius of the neutron with very small effects on the other form factors .",
    "the effective constant @xmath72 parametrizes , in the simplest way , the creation of @xmath93 pairs in the hadronic medium .",
    "its effectiveness reflects gluon exchange interactions , maybe mostly related to the confinement potential and other non - perturbative effects .",
    "with respect to its particular value , and to ensure the consistency of the whole scheme , strong processes such as pionic decays of resonances , and photo and electroproduction of resonances should be described within the same model and with the same value of @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "therefore not much can be said about the reasonable value of @xmath72 until this medium term program is carried out .",
    "our results can be compared with those of ref .",
    "@xcite , where exchange currents and quark form factors contributions to the charge radii are evaluated .",
    "the effects of exchange currents are partially taken into account in the @xmath3 model through the effective value of @xmath72 .",
    "however , @xmath76 and @xmath22 propagation diagrams in our model incorporate quark ",
    "antiquark interactions and would thus be related to quark form factors rather than to exchange currents .    finally , some comments are in order about the kinematical relativistic corrections , which have been also the subject of recent interest @xcite . undoubtedly these corrections are important and affect the predicted values of the form factors by introducing new @xmath4 dependences which can also contribute to the square charge radius .",
    "for example , the authors of ref.@xcite obtain a value for @xmath118 close to the experimental number .",
    "nonetheless we do no think that they could play , in an effective way , the role of the dynamical mechanisms described here : in particular concerning the contributions of the @xmath76 and @xmath22 mesons to the nucleon form factors . as a matter of fact",
    "one could use a simple counting of the normalization and boost factors when employing relativistic wave functions instead of non  relativistic ones @xcite without invoking the detailed dynamics at all .    in summary",
    "we have developed a consistent model to treat some relativistic dynamical corrections to the nucleon form factors .",
    "the model operator includes the effect of @xmath119 baryon components generated through a @xmath3 mechanism .",
    "gauge invariance is ensured through the mass renormalization associated to such a mechanism .",
    "the only free parameter in the model is @xmath72 , the strength of the creation of pairs in the hadronic medium , which is fitted to the magnetic moment of the proton .",
    "the results obtained seem to confirm our initial expectations about the consideration of @xmath2 contributions as an essential physical ingredient in the description of electromagnetic transition processes .",
